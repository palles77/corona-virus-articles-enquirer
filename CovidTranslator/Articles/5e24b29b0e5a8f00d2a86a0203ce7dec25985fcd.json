Using an experimental infection model in ferrets, we examined the pathological features and characterized the host immune responses by using microarray analysis, during infection with 2009-H1N1 A/California/07/2009 and seasonal A/Brisbane/59/2007. Chemokines CCL2, CCL8, CXCL7 and CXCL10 along with the majority of interferon-stimulated genes were expressed early, correlated to lung pathology, and abruptly decreased expression on day 7 following infection of A/California/07/2009. Interestingly, the drop in innate immune gene expression was replaced by a significant increase of the adaptive immune genes for granzymes and immunoglobulins. Serum anti-influenza antibodies were first observed on day 7, commensurate with the viral clearance. We propose that lung pathology in humans occurs during the innate phase of host immunity and a delay or failure to switch to the adaptive phase may contribute to morbidity and mortality during severe 2009-H1N1 infections.",

            "text": "influenza; 2009 H1N1; ferrets; immune response; microarrays; cytokines In the spring of 2009, human transmission of a new influenza A strain was reported in the United States and Mexico (2009a; 2009b; 2009c; 2009d; Cameron, Rowe, and Kelvin, 2009; Chowell et al., 2009; Dawood et al., 2009; Perez-Padilla et al., 2009; Shinde et al., 2009) , within a few weeks it spread to other regions of the globe and the World Health Organization raised the pandemic alert phase to \"level 6, of moderate severity\" (http://www.who.it/influenza/AH1N1/20090611_11). By the end of November, worldwide more than 207 countries and overseas territories had reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A virus (2009-H1N1), including over 7820 deaths (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_11_27a/en/index.html). This influenza virus is a triplereassortment of multiple strains of influenza A viruses circulating in the domestic swine population . While the vast majority of human cases appear to be self limiting and resolve within two weeks of onset of symptoms, a small number of infections lead to severe respiratory illness. Symptoms include fever and cough and possible sore throat, diarrhea and vomiting. In a minority of cases, 6-10 days following onset of symptoms, severe lower respiratory complications arise with radiographic abnormalities. Hospitalization and ventilation in these cases may be required. Fatal cases, while extremely rare, are most often associated with underlying medical conditions that contribute to illness severity. Interestingly, histological examination of a lung specimen from a severe case of 2009-H1N1 showed necrotizing bronchiolitis with alveolar damage and hyaline formation (Perez-Padilla et al., 2009) . This finding is similar to histopathological findings in human influenza infected lung specimens from previous pandemics (Taubenberger and Morens, 2008) .",

The antigenic dissimilarity between 2009-H1N1 and seasonal H1N1 viruses suggests that the general population has little or no preexisting immunity to 2009-H1N1. This notion is reinforced since some seasonally vaccinated individuals develop classic influenza symptoms and illness caused by 2009-H1N1 infection. In the absence of preexisting immunity in the general population, the modest mortality and morbidity associated with the majority of human 2009-H1N1 infections are puzzling. The paucity of information regarding host immune responses to 2009-H1N1 and the role they play in controlling the viral infection led us to investigate the evolution of innate and adaptive host immune responses following 2009-H1N1 exposure.",

All procedures were conducted in accordance with the NRC Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Animal Welfare Act, and the CDC-NIH Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical laboratories and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All ferrets were proven seronegative by HI assay against A/California/ 04/2009, A/Brisbane/59/2007 and B/Florida/04/2006. Castrated, descented male fitch ferrets (Mustela putorius furo), 5 -9 months of age and weighing between 800 to 1500 grams (Triple F Farms Inc., Sayre, PA, USA) were pair-housed in individually HEPA-Filtered biocontainment caging (Allentown Inc., Allentown, NJ, USA). Ferrets were given food and water ad libitum. Animals were infected and monitored as previously described (Zitzow et al., 2002) , except using 5% isofluorane anesthesia. Briefly, 29 male fitch ferrets were anesthetized with isofluorane and infected intranasally with 1\u00d710 6 50% egg infectious doses (EID 50 ) (~1\u00d710 5.75 TCID 50 /ml) of A/California/07/2009 in a volume of one milliliter. From these, four animals were sacrificed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days post infection (PI). Nasal washes, lung tissue and blood samples were collected from each ferret in order to determine viral load, gross and histopathological findings, innate and adaptive host immune responses, and molecular changes associated with disease course. The remaining nine animals were allowed to go to endpoint. A/California/07/2009 is the World Health Organization recommended isolate for generation of 2009-H1N1 vaccines (http://www.who.int/entity/csr/resources/publications/swineflu/ H1N1Vaccinevirusrecommendation26May2009.pdf) and was thus the virus used for ferret studies. An additional 4 ferrets were used as Day 0 uninfected controls. Temperatures were measured through use of an implantable temperature transponder (BMDS, Sayre, PA) and were recorded daily at approximately the same time each day. Pre-infection values were averaged to obtain a baseline temperature for each ferret. The change in temperature was calculated daily for each animal. Weight loss and clinical signs of sneezing and nasal discharge, other respiratory distress, and level of activity were assessed daily. A scoring system was used to assess activity level where 0=alert and playful; 1=alert but playful only when stimulated; 2=alert but not playful when stimulated; 3=neither alert nor playful when stimulated. Based on the daily scores for each animal in a group, a relative inactivity index was calculated (Zitzow et al., 2002 ).",

            "text": "To determine the temporal relationship between host immune responses and the progression and resolution of 2009-H1N1 clinical disease, we conducted a longitudinal study of expression patterns of host immune genes in the lungs of infected animals using high density microarrays (Figs. 3A and 4A-B). On day three post infection, there was a significant increase in interferon stimulated genes (ISG) (Fig. 3A) , a functional group that included numerous genes for antiviral proteins (e.g. OAS1&2) and transcriptional regulators (e.g. STAT1) (Malmgaard, 2004) . In contrast to the robust expression pattern observed for 2009-H1N1, lungs from animals infected with seasonal H1N1 Brisbane/59 expressed a restricted pattern of ISGs. On day 5, only 12 ISGs were upregulated (mean expression levels were at least 1.5-fold respect to the control group), while lungs from ferrets infected with California/07 displayed 26 upregulated ISGs. Concomitant with early expression of ISGs, California/07 induced the expression of multiple chemokines including CCL2, CCL8, CCL13, CCL19, CXCL7 and CXCL10, and also inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figs. 4A and 5A). These mediators participate in the recruitment of multiple leukocyte subsets including NK cells, monocyte/ macrophages, T cells and granulocytes (Charo and Ransohoff, 2006) . We observed that their expression patterns coincided with the infiltration of inflammatory mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the lungs during infection with California/07 ( Fig. 2A-L) . Lungs from Brisbane/59-infected animals showed involvement of a limited number of cytokine/chemokines (Fig. 4A ) and lower expression levels compared with California/07 (Fig.  5A ). The modest lung response during the infection with Brisbane/59, in terms of ISGs, cytokines and chemokines, is likely due to a lack of local host immune activation as the lungs had no detectable viral load (table 1). In the lungs of California/07-infected ferrets, a striking decrease in the expression of ISGs and the chemokines CCL2, CCL8, and CXCL10 takes place on day 7 (Figs. 3A, 4A and 5A). Clinically, on day seven, animals reached the nadir of weight loss and began a slow, but progressive increase, in weight. In contrast to the reduction in ISG and chemokine expression on day seven, expression of genes associated with the effector phase of adaptive immunity (e.g. Ig lambda, CD3, Granzyme A, Granzyme B, and Granzyme H) are increased in 2009-H1N1 infected lungs (Fig. 4B) . Similarly, increased expression of granzyme A, B, and H are also observed in peripheral blood on Day 7 (Fig. 5B) . The shift from innate to adaptive immune responses is further supported by the appearance of hemagglutinin inhibiting serum antibodies on day 7 (Fig. 5C ).",

Infected ferrets display a number of pathological alterations, such as increased temperature, sneezing, loss of body weight and histological features consistent with virally induced pneumonia, an experimental model that mimics 2009-H1N1 human disease. The results from our study and those from recently published papers, show that the severity can range from a sublethal infection with mild symptoms when using A/California/04/2009 (Itoh et al., 2009; Maines et al., 2009 ) and A/Netherlands/602/2009 (Munster et al., 2009) influenza strains, to 30% lethality found in our study with California/07, or 50% lethality with A/Mexico/4482/2009 (Maines et al., 2009) . All these viral strains infected both the lower and upper respiratory tracts in ferrets. On the contrary, our results and others (Maines et al., 2009) , show that seasonal H1N1 Brisbane/ 59 causes mild illness in ferrets and only affects the upper respiratory tract. While our pathological findings are in keeping with the findings of other authors, our unique immunological data allows for the ability to model host immune responses and pathological changes to 2009-H1N1 over the course of illness.",

It is well established the relationship between high levels of proinflammatory mediators and degree of lung pathology (de Jong et al., 2006) , however the contribution of other factors, such as the direct cytopatic effect caused by the virus, still needs to be assessed. The progressive increase in weight and overall health of animals between days 7 to 14, and the elimination of viral load in respiratory tissues by day 7, indicates that adaptive immune mechanisms were responsible for resolution of 2009-H1N1 induced disease. Infection with Brisbane/59 also produced the early production of neutralizing antibodies and granzymes on day 7, however it is possible that the virus had already been cleared by the innate response (Brisbane/59 is below detection levels on day 3) by the time when the adaptive response was triggered in na\u00efve ferrets.",
