Seizure disorders in cats have been reviewed in previous literature. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] A seizure is a clinically detectable manifestation of paroxysmal, excessive, and synchronous discharges of a population of hyperexcitable cerebral neurons. Classification schemes are reviewed for determining seizure type and differential diagnoses. Acquired causes for seizures are emphasized to assist with diagnosis and treatment of seizure disorders in cats.",

Podell, Fenner, and Powers adopted a nomenclature scheme from human epilepsies based on identifiable causes. 10 Primary epileptic seizure (idiopathic) is the term used if an underlying cause cannot be identified. If seizures result from a structural lesion, they are defined as secondary epileptic seizures. The term reactive epileptic seizure is used when the normal brain reacts to transient systemic insult or physiological stresses; these seizures are not considered recurrent. Epilepsies also are described as asymptomatic (primary, idiopathic) and symptomatic (secondary). 11 I use the terminology of primary and secondary epilepsies for this discussion. Secondary epilepsy is common in cats, and appropriate diagnostic tests are necessary to determine the underlying cause. 2, 3, 5, 6 Primary epilepsy implies recurrent episodes of seizure activity associated with a primary functional cerebral disorder (having a physiological or biochemically related genetic basis). Typically, these seizures are tonic clonic and generalized with no identifiable structural brain lesions. Physical and neurological examinations are normal. Advanced imaging and CSF analysis results are normal. Incidence of primary epilepsy in cats is low when compared with that of dogs.",

Others classify secondary epilepsy (symptomatic) as recurrent episodes of seizure activity associated with an underlying structural disorder such as inflammation, trauma, ongoing hypoxia or ischemia, or neoplasia. 2, 3, 9 In cases of secondary epilepsy, partial seizures (focal or complex partial with or without secondary generalization) are observed more commonly and may be accompanied by an abnormal neurological examination with or without lateralization.

Generalized seizures (tonic-clonic or grand-mal seizures) manifest as loss of consciousness, recumbency, and tonic-clonic motor activity. The major motor activity can consist of generalized tonic movements with the limbs in rigid extension and pur-poseless limb movements and paddling. Opisthotonus and claw extension in addition to mouth-chomping and pupillary dilation also may be observed. At times, tonic flexion (emprosthotonus) is observed, which may be followed by moderate to severe muscle twitching (clonic phase). The patient may not have loss of consciousness during this type of event. Sometimes generalized seizures can be violent. The cat may jump up into the air as if it were thrown and propel itself forward and from side to side. Autonomic release (urination and defecation) usually accompanies the motor activity in addition to facial twitching, salivation, kicking, piloerection, and chewing (Figure 55-1). Self-inflicted trauma may be observed to include contusions, excoriations, biting of the tongue, or avulsion of the claws. Cats also may exhibit mild or nonconvulsive seizures, which are manifested by impaired consciousness, pupillary dilation, bilateral facial twitching, muscle spasms of the head and neck, and possibly, autonomic release.

Cats with focal seizures often twitch the eyelids, whiskers, and/or ears either in combination or separately. Head-shaking may occur and be accompanied by body jerking. Salivation, urination, and pupillary dilation are transient signs. Continuous vocalization and a brief rise in body temperature can be observed. Hyperthermia ensues as a result of continuous motor activity that can last from minutes to hours. Partial motor seizures are variable in clinical presentation and difficult to recognize for the untrained eye. 2, 5, 6 Also, partial seizures may progress to tonic-clonic or generalized seizures. Seizures of this type may be more difficult to control because of the prolonged ictal phase. Up to one third of cats have seizures that progress to status epilepticus or cluster seizures. Cats also may have an atypical presentation of nonconvulsive seizures that go undetected for prolonged periods. 2, 6, 12, 13 Requesting the pet owner to videotape these episodes is helpful to document the severity and type of seizure.",

Neurological signs are consistent with a diffuse forebrain localization and commonly are episodic in onset. If seizures occur, they are accompanied by long periods of abnormal behavior and mentation. Aberrant or bizarre behavior, dementia, aggression, ataxia, head pressing, propulsive circling, blindness, mydriasis, ptyalism, and partial or generalized seizures, may be observed. In cases of portosystemic shunts, the aforementioned signs may occur within hours after eating and often are accompanied by severe ptyalism. Excess salivation is not a manifestation of seizure activity but is theorized to be due to cerebrocortical-mediated abnormal behavior. 5, 14 Routine complete blood cell counts and serum chemistries in addition to preprandial and postprandial bile acids, resting ammonia levels, abdominal ultrasound, rectal portal scintigraphy and intraoperative portography, and liver biopsy are useful diagnostic aids. Low-protein diets, oral and parenteral antibiotics, antifibrotic agents, and lactulose are indicated for medical treatment of HE depending on the underlying cause. Surgical correction is the treatment of choice for an extrahepatic shunt in the feline patient. 14 Placement of an ameroid ring constrictor on single extrahepatic portosystemic shunts in cats resulted in a low rate of surgical complication and postoperative mortality. 15 Many cats did have postoperative complications. Neurological complications included central blindness, hyperthermia, frantic behavior, and generalized motor seizures. The pathophysiological mechanism of postligational seizures is poorly understood. 14 Alterations in benzodiazepine concentration have been associated with post-ligational seizures.

Cats are exposed to lead paint chips during home remodeling and ingest the lead through their grooming habits. Chronic exposure to small amounts of lead results in a toxicosis. The effect of lead on the nervous system occurs secondary to decreased blood supply because of capillary and small arteriolar damage. Laminar cortical necrosis is a common histological finding. CNS signs can include altered levels of consciousness, hyperexcitability, excessive vocalization, seizures (either partial or generalized), opisthotonus, paraparesis/plegia, muscle spasms, hyperesthesia, mydriasis, or blindness. Diagnosis is based upon history, clinical signs, and the finding of blood lead levels above 0.35 ppm. Treatment includes removal of lead from the gastrointestinal tract and use of lead chelators such as calcium EDTA. 5 ORGANOPHOSPHATES AND CARBAMATES. Organophosphates (OP) and the carbamates are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and common ingredients in flea shampoos and parasite dips. Accumulation of acetylcholine occurs at nerve endings, which results in overstimulation of cholinergic receptors of the somatic, autonomic, and central nervous systems. 5 Clinical signs reflect actions of acetylcholine on muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors. These signs include vomiting, ptyalism, lacrimation, diarrhea, and, on occasion, hyperactivity and seizure activity. Diagnosis is based upon the history of ingestion and clinical signs. Treatment consists of parasympatholytic agents, supportive care, and antiepileptic drug therapy. Atropine counteracts the muscarinic effects of OP or carbamate toxicity. Pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM, Protopam Chloride, Wyeth-Ayerst) is administered as soon as possible after exposure. 2-PAM disrupts the bond between the OP and acetylcholinesterase to form a complex that is eliminated in the urine. 2-PAM is most effective if administered within the first several hours after exposure before the OP \"age\" with time. Diphenhydramine is recommended to counteract the nicotinic effects of OP toxicity. More in-depth discussion for treatment is covered in the fourth volume of Consultations in Feline Internal Medicine, Chapter 48.",

The incidence of seizures is reported variably in the literature, and seizure activity often is accompanied by concurrent systemic illness (FIP and toxoplasmosis). 22 According to some reports, the most common structural cause of seizures in cats (47 per cent) is a nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis of an unknown etiology, but suspected to be viral or immune-mediated. 2, 8, 9 Recurrent seizures were the only clinical sign in the majority of cats in this study and appeared to be self-limiting, but seizures persisted in some cats. It is believed currently that these cases are likely to be the result of a non-FIP virus yet to be identified. 8 Cats of all ages were affected and demonstrated the full spectrum of seizure activity from focal events up to status epilepticus. 9 Results of neurodiagnostic testing were within normal limits. Most cats had an excellent outcome on anticonvulsants, including those with severe and initially refractory seizures. In another study describing nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis, it was the third most frequent diagnosis after neoplasia and FIP as a cause of seizures in cats. In these cases, concurrent systemic illness and mild to moderate changes in cerebrospinal fluid were observed. 12 Symptomatic treatment includes antiepileptic drug therapy and antiinflammatory drugs if other infectious/inflammatory diseases have been excluded.",

Rapid and aggressive supportive care is essential to outcome for the head trauma patient. Assessment of the whole patient is important, because injuries to multiple systems are not uncommon. Medical management for head trauma consists of providing a functional airway and promoting vascular support with appropriate fluid therapy. Adjunctive therapies consist of osmotherapies with mannitol and/or hypertonic saline, hyperoxygenation, and meticulous patient monitoring.

The seizure episodes are defined thoroughly to determine actual occurrence of a seizure or mimicking clinical signs. Cardiovascular-related syncope, vestibular dysfunction, behavior disturbances, or pain are examples that can mimic a seizure event. Physical examination is important for detecting systemic disorders that may manifest neurological signs secondarily. The neurological examination will determine the presence of neurological dysfunction. The neuroanatomical localization for seizures is the forebrain. The neurological examination also may define the localization as focal, multifocal, or diffuse (Table 55 -2). A minimum database for a cat with seizures should include a complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, urinalysis, preprandial and postprandial bile acids, retinal fundic examination, and tests for FeLV and FIV. Cats older than 5 years of age also should have blood pressure monitoring, thyroid hormone (T 4 ) screening, thoracic and abdominal radiographs, and cardiac evaluation (ECG and echocardiography).

AED therapy usually is warranted when seizures are caused by structural lesions of the brain. Long-term maintenance therapy often is indicated with persistent seizure activity. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 27 Realistic goals of AED therapy are to decrease the frequency of the seizures, reduce their severity, and enhance the quality of life for the patient and pet owner. The prognosis should not be based upon the severity of the seizure. Some cats who present with status epilepticus may respond extremely well to anticonvulsant therapy. In my experience, early aggressive therapy is the key to seizure control in acute and chronic situations. Patients refractory to medication need reevaluation for progression of the intracranial disease not addressed previously, assessment of owner compliance, and additional monitoring for drug tolerance. Many owners may have difficulty administering oral medications to their cats and need to be educated about consistency of drug administration and routine drug monitoring. Journal documentation of seizure activity is a useful tool for assessment of medication compliance. ",

            "text": "Phenobarbital is the AED therapy of choice for control of seizures in cats. Pharmacokinetics have been well established and most veterinary laboratories perform routine drug monitoring. Phenobarbital is relatively safe and inexpensive and has proven efficacy for seizure control in cats. The recommended dose is 1.25 to 2.5 mg/kg PO q12h. The elimination half-life in cats can range between 43 and 76 hours. Steady-state serum concentration is achieved within 9 to 16 days of starting therapy. Serum drug concentrations ideally should be measured within 2 to 3 weeks of initiating therapy or after a change in dosage. Therapeutic blood levels are similar to those reported in dogs (25 to 40 \u00b5g/ml). Optimal recommended therapeutic target range for serum phenobarbital concentrations for cats is between 23 and 30 \u00b5g/ml. This target range maximizes seizure control with fewer side effects. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 24, [27] [28] [29] The pharmacokinetics of phenobarbital in cats are less predictable than in dogs. Phenobarbital is metabolized primarily by the liver. Establishing a baseline of liver function using pre-and post-bile acid testing is recommended before initiating maintenance phenobarbital doses. 6 Serum concentrations should be evaluated every 6 months. 2, 7, 8 Periodic monitoring of the complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, and bile acids is recommended. Side effects of phenobarbital include sedation, ataxia, polyphagia, and weight gain. Sedation and ataxia usually are transient and subside within 1 to 2 weeks after initial administration or a change in dose, although exceptions do occur. 6 Cats are considered sensitive to the sedative effects of AEDs, related to a slower elimination rate. The dose should start low and increase incrementally. In my experience, drug-associated polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia occur less commonly in cats than in dogs. Rare idiosyncratic reactions include blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia), hepatotoxicity, dermatitis, and persistent, unusual behavioral disturbances. 6, 24 Benzodiazepines",

The half-life has been reported to be 13 days in cats, roughly one third the time of that reported in dogs. The steady-state usually is attained within 2 months. Minimum therapeutic concentrations are reached within 3 weeks of initiating therapy. The recommended dose of bromide in cats is 20 to 30 mg/kg PO q24h. 31, 32 The target range for serum bromide concentration is between 1.0 and 1.6 mg/ml. 32 Adverse side effects occur in approximately 50 per cent of cats administered bromide. Side effects include polydipsia, vomiting, weight gain, sedation, and coughing. Coughing has a reported incidence in 35 to 42 per cent of cats. 6, 8, [31] [32] [33] A study at Ohio State University reported 11 of 26 cats treated with bromide developed a persistent, nonproductive cough. 33 Coughing is acute in onset and may be associated with dyspnea. Thoracic radiographs reveal mild to marked peribronchial infiltrates, similar to those observed with asthma. Bronchoalveolar lavage has revealed inflammatory changes with eosinophils dominating. 8, 33 Withdrawal of the drug often results in resolution of clinical signs; however, three of 17 cats reportedly died from complications associated with drug administration. A thorough history of prior airway disease must be obtained before initiation of bromide therapy. The drug should be discontinued immediately if coughing is reported by the owner. 6",

Successful management is defined as decrease in seizure severity and frequency and a good quality of life. In my experience, three to four seizures a year is considered acceptable. If seizure severity and frequency are not improved after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, recommendations include reevaluating the underlying cause and monitoring drug concentrations. If the serum drug concentrations are below or at the low end of the therapeutic range, the dosage is increased incrementally. If drug concentrations are well within the therapeutic range, or if the serum level does not rise with an increase in drug administration (tolerance), adjunctive therapy may be pursued. Options to discontinue AED therapy may be considered when seizure activity ceases for 6 to 12 months. 7 The standard recommendation is to decrease the dose by one third every 2 weeks. In my opinion, if the cat is tolerating the drug and showing minimal side effects, I would not discontinue the medication.",

Additional supportive care includes fluid therapy, temperature regulation, oxygen supplementation, continuous electrocardiogram, and frequent turning.
