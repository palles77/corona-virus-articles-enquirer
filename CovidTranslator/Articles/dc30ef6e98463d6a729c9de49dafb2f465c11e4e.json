            "text": "The survival of patients with critical congenital heart disease (CHD) has improved greatly with surgical advances and improvements in critical care. However, postoperative morbidity remains a significant problem, with respiratory complications being a substantial burden. A mechanistic link between CHD and the disturbance of airway clearance was suggested with the recent realization that motile cilia are required for both airway mucociliary clearance and embryonic development of visceral organ asymmetry, including the cardiovascular system. [1] [2] [3] [4] Indeed, previous studies have shown CHD patients with heterotaxy (HTX), a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning, have a high prevalence of motile ciliary dysfunction (CD), with those exhibiting CD suffering increased postoperative morbidity. [5] [6] [7] CD in HTX CHD patients was identified by measuring nasal nitric oxide (nNO) and obtaining nasal epithelial scrapes for ciliary videomicroscopy assessment, 2 tests commonly used to evaluate for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a sinopulmonary disease associated with very low nNO and immotile or dyskinetic airway ciliary motion (CM). 8 With these same tests, a study was conducted on outpatients with a broad spectrum of both HTX and non-HTX CHD, revealing a similarly high prevalence of CD (combination of both abnormal CM and low nNO in 33% of HTX CHD and 17% of non-HTX CHD). 9 CD in these patients was associated with increased sinopulmonary symptoms, with ciliary function status shown to be more important than HTX status for determining the risk of manifesting sinopulmonary symptoms. 9 In this current study, we investigated the hypothesis that non-HTX CHD patients with CD have increased postoperative morbidity and more respiratory complications. With previous evidence that CHD patients with CD could have abnormal CM with normal nNO or low nNO with normal CM, 9 we further examined whether abnormal CM versus low nNO posed different risks for postoperative morbidity.",

Pneumothorax was defined as clinical symptoms with radiographic evidence of air in the pleural space. Diaphragm paresis was noted for patients with sonographic or fluoroscopic evidence of paresis. Qualitative systemic ventricular function was abstracted from transthoracic echocardiography assessments by pediatric cardiologists who were blinded to all aspects of the study. Viral infection was defined as presence of clinical symptoms and positive nasal viral panel. Bacterial infection was defined as presence of clinical symptoms and positive blood culture and excluded pneumonia and tracheitis. Fungal infection was defined as presence of clinical symptoms and positive fungal culture. Pneumonia (bacterial) was defined as clinical symptoms, the presence of infiltrate on chest radiograph, and infectious disease recommendation to treat with antimicrobials for bacterial pneumonia.

For patient characteristics, the c 2 test was used to compare categorical variables and the Fisher exact test was applied when appropriate, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare continuous variables between subgroups. For baseline surgical characteristics and postoperative outcomes, mixed-effects models were applied to adjust for the intrasubject correlation among multiple surgical events of individual patients. As the postoperative continuous outcomes were right-skewed, the linear mixed models for repeated measures were used to analyze the effect of CM and nNO on the log-transformed continuous outcomes that were approximately normal after transformation. The generalized linear mixed models for repeated measures were used for assess the differences in the categorical outcomes between the abnormal and normal CM or nNO subgroups. Multivariate analysis of adverse postoperative outcomes based on generalized linear mixed models was performed to examine the effect of CM or nNO, controlling for baseline surgical characteristics (age, weight, surgical severity, ventricular function, and single-ventricle status). All tests were 2sided, and a P value .01 was considered statistically significant. A more conservative significance level of .01 was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.

The decreased systolic function in the low nNO patients persisted in 9 of 16 patients up to the time of hospital discharge. Low nNO also was correlated with an increase in number of days treated with milrinone (6 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] days vs 4 [3-6] days; P \u00bc .021), dexmedetomidine (6 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] days vs 3 [2-6] days; P \u00bc .002), and nicardipine requirement (34% vs 6%; P \u00bc .034) ( Table 3 ). All other postoperative medications used, including inhaled NO, were not different among patients with normal or low nNO (Table E4) .",

This is suggested by increased use of respiratory medications, including b-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids, and the need for NIPPV.

It was particularly underpowered to detect a difference in outcome for infants with both abnormal CM and low nNO, or a mortality difference, given the very low mortality rate in our study population.

Endothelial cilia are fluid shear sensors that regulate calcium signaling and nitric oxide production through polycystin-1. Circulation. 2008;117:1161-71. APPENDIX 1. SUPPLEMENTAL METHODS AND RESULTS Nasal epithelial tissue samples were obtained using Rhino-Probe curettage of the inferior nasal turbinate. High-speed videomicroscopy was performed and the tissue placed in culture. Upon culture, nasal epithelial cells lose their cilia, dedifferentiate, and undergo mitoses, whereupon they were grown to confluence. After confluence was achieved, cells were placed in suspension culture, allowed to reciliate, and videomicroscopy performed on the reciliated tissue. Ciliary motion (CM) of both the initial nasal scrape as well as reciliated tissue was evaluated by a panel of 3 investigators (C.W.L., M.Z., and O.K.) who were blinded to the patient phenotype and nasal nitric oxide values. Five to fifteen videos were reviewed for each sample/subject and CM classified as 1, normal; 2, probably normal; 3, probably abnormal; or 4, abnormal by consensus evaluation. To create a binary variable, those with scores of 1 or 2 were categorized as normal CM, and those with 3 or 4 were categorized as abnormal CM. Samples were not obtained on patients with evidence of ongoing respiratory disease. Whenever reciliation was possible, final determination of CM was made based on findings from reciliated epithelial tissue, to exclude secondary (environmental, medication) causes of abnormal CM. Twenty-seven (43%) of 63 patients had successful reciliation of nasal epithelial cells. Three (11%) patients had a change in the classification of their ciliary motion after reciliation was performed.Most patients underwent genetic evaluation with a comparative genomic hybridization \u00fe single-nucleotide polymorphism microarray E1 (constructed by the International Standards for Cytogenomic Arrays), which was performed at the Pittsburgh Cytogenetics Laboratory at Magee-Women's Hospital of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. In patients with suspected genetic syndromes in whom a microarray was normal, a genetics consultation was obtained to determine the need for additional genetic testing. In 8% (5/63) patients, no genetic testing was available for review.E-ReferenceE1. Yatsenko SA, Davis S, Hendrix NW, Surti U, Emery S, Canavan T, et al.
