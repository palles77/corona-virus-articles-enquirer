The cases occurred throughout the year with a peak incidence in the winter. The 39 patients ranged in age from 6 weeks to 13 years, the peak incidence beig among infants aged 1-6 months. The clinical features of calcivirus infection are not distinguishable from those of rotavirus infection. INTRODUCTION WITHIN the past decade viruses have been demonstrated by electron microscopy in the stools of those with and those without the symptoms of gastroenteritis. The agents reported include rotavirus, Norwalk-like agents, calicivirus, astrovirus, and coronavirus. The aetiological role of most of these agents is still not clearly defined and further information on the part they play in human diarrhoea has been called for.' I This report presents some further clinical, serological, and epidemiological data on one of the more recently discovered agents, calicivirus, and is based on a study of 39 sporadic cases in North West London.",

(A separate report on other features of this study is being prepared.) Questionnaires were completed for 28 (72%) of the patients with calicivirus. The data presented are based on these responses except in respect of age and sex of patient and month of infection, which are based on 39 cases. OUTBREAK STRAINS OF CALICIVIRUS was reported in a third of the cases.9 Failure to thrive and malabsorption was reported in only 3 cases. 5 children had fever. The duration of symptoms ranged from two to eleven days with most illnesses lasting about four days. 13 (46%) of the affected children had siblings and, of these, 5 had at least 1 sibling with similar symptoms of illness. In 1 case the brother attended a school where there was a concurrent outbreak of diarrhoea and vomiting. The duration of excretion of viruses is shown in table I; the finding that the chances of detecting virus diminishes after the fourth day emphasises the need to obtain specimens during the symptomatic phase of illness.\"5 Serology (immune electron microscopy [IEM] .-Four strains of virus found in sporadic infections were tested against sera from three reported outbreaks2,4,6 (table II). There is little evidence of serological relations between the sporadic strains and strains associated with two of the outbreaks, but there is some evidence for a relation with the third.2 DISCUSSION Viruses morphologically identical with caliciviruses have recently been detected in animals',8 and people9-1 with gastroenteritis. The study of outbreaks in man in the U.K.,2,4,12 Japan,6 and Canadal3 has provided evidence that these viruses can cause diarrhoea and vomiting in all agegroups other than neonates. The apparent absence of cases in neonates may be due to predominantly asymptomatic infection or be associated with immunity due to maternal antibody.",

No adult infection was detected, although this is known to occur.4 Neonatal infection was not encountered, although many stools from babies in special care baby units were included in the gastroenteritis study.Sex ratio.-The higher infection rate in male children reported for other gastroenteritis viruses was demonstrated among the sporadic cases of calicivirus infection(fig. 2). 24 males were infected and 15 females, a ratio of 1 -6/ 1. Clinical features.-These were recorded in 28 patients,26   of whom had been admitted to hospital. Diarrhoea was the commonest clinical feature, occurring in 25 (89%) of the 28 cases. Vomiting was reported in 14 (50%); only 1 patient had vomiting without diarrhoea and this was the only case of projectile vomiting reported. 2 children had neither diarrhoea nor vomiting.
