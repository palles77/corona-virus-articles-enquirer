            "text": "There is no gold standard for detection of Rotavirus Group A (RVA), one of the main causes of diarrhea in neonatal animals. Sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR) assays are available for RVA but require submission of the clinical samples to diagnostic laboratories. Patient-side immunoassays for RVA protein detection have shown variable results, particularly with samples from unintended species. A sensitive and specific test for detection of RVA on the farm would facilitate rapid management decisions. The insulated isothermal RT-PCR (RT-iiPCR) assay works in a portable machine to allow sensitive and specific on-site testing. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate a commercially available RT-iiPCR assay for RVA detection in feces from different animal species. This assay was compared to an in-house rtRT-PCR assay and a commercially available rtRT-PCR kit, as well as an ELISA and EM for RVA detection. All three PCR assays targeted the well-conserved NSP5 gene. Clinical fecal samples from 108 diarrheic animals (mainly cattle and horses) were tested. The percentage of positive samples by ELISA, EM, inhouse rtRT-PCR, commercial rtRT-PCR, and RT-iiPCR was 29.4%, 31%, 36.7%, 51.4%, 56.9%, respectively. The agreement between different assays was high (81.3-100%) in samples containing high viral loads. The sensitivity of the RT-iiPCR assay appeared to be higher than the commercially available rtRT-PCR assay, with a limit of detection (95% confidence index) of 3-4 copies of in vitro transcribed dsRNA. In conclusion, the user-friendly, field-deployable RT-iiPCR system holds substantial promise for on-site detection of RVA.",

Clinically healthy newborn animals may also shed RVA, but the prevalence is lower compared to animals exhibiting diarrhea (Kaminjolo and Adesiyun, 1994) . Studies have shown that detection of rotavirus in the presence of diarrhea is a significant finding in calf diarrhea (Cho et al., 2013) .

            "text": "There are many assays used for diagnosis of RVA. Historically, diagnostic laboratories routinely used electron microscopy (EM) for detection of the virus. However, due to the costs of the microscope and its maintenance, as well as the required technical expertise, this method has lost favor. Additionally, EM lacks sensitivity, requiring \u223c10 6 viral particles/ml for virus detection (Maes et al., 2003) . Immunoassays (such as ELISAs) have replaced EM as the diagnostic test of choice for detection of viral antigen because of their ease of use and speed of obtaining a result (Desselberger, 2014) . Most of the commercially available ELISA kits are based on monoclonal antibodies against VP6 glycoprotein, which is expressed at a high level during infection. The VP6 glycoprotein is conserved among RVA of different animal species, allowing cross-reactivity and detection of the virus from different hosts. Therefore, the commercially available human RVA ELISA assays have been used for detection of RVA in animals (Bailey et al., 2013) . However, as a result of antigenic drift, there are several variants or genotypes of RVA VP6 that have been described (Mino et al., 2015) . Differences among these VP6 genotypes influence the performance of various commercially available VP6 based immunoassays. Therefore, diagnostic kit validation for each species is necessary. Not all the assays have been validated for use in all animal species, and this is particularly true for horses (Mino et al., 2015) . In fact, one human RVA rapid immunoassay developed for patient-side use was shown not to work in detection of RVA in horses (Slovis et al., 2014) .",

However, these types of assays are run in commercial or diagnostic laboratories and require expensive equipment and advanced technical skills, resulting in increasing costs to the producer, which leads to a reduction in the use of laboratory assays to support field disease investigations (Izzo et al., 2012) . Therefore, the aim of our investigation was to evaluate a recently available insulated isothermal RT-PCR (RT-iiPCR) reagent set (POCKIT TM Rotavirus A Reagent Set, GeneReach USA, Lexington, MA, USA) with use of a portable PCR machine, which could potentially be used for point-of-need detection for RVA in the feces of different animal species.

The limitation of antibody-based tests for the detection of enteric pathogens is the requirement of high concentration of free antigen to generate a positive reaction, the free antigen is decreased significantly during the course of disease. Therefore, these tests have lower sensitivity and could miss positive samples collected late in the course of clinical disease, when compared to RT-PCR (Izzo et al., 2012; Maes et al., 2003) .

The agreement between EM and ELISA was 85.5%, which was similar to previously published reports (Athanassious et al., 1994; Benfield et al., 1984; Reynolds et al., 1984) , and both of these methods lacked the sensitivity achieved with molecular assays, which has also been previously reported (Izzo et al., 2012) . Interestingly, three positive samples by ELISA in this study were negative by EM and all three molecular assays. The ELISA assay absorbance values for these samples ranged from 0.2 to 0.5, which indicates low viral load according to the manufacturer. These samples were considered false positives. False positive results are not uncommon for ELISA assays as a result of the complex sample matrix (i.e. gut microbiota), which can increase the probability of cross-reactions. The type of antibodies (polyclonal versus monoclonal) used strongly affects their detection efficiency. The use of monoclonal antibodies is usually associated with increased specificity of the assay, but this also creates potential problems with regard to amino acid variability among the rotaviruses from different species",

            "text": "Another complication with detection of rotavirus is the fact that it can be detected in both healthy and diseased animals. Establishing a causal relationship may be difficult without demonstration of classic histopathological changes (Izzo et al., 2012) , particularly when using highly sensitive molecular detection methods. Considering animals shed up to 10 8 -10 12 virions/ml of feces during the acute phase of infection (Izzo et al., 2012) , positive results obtained with less sensitive methods (EM and ELISA) are more likely to be associated with causality. In human medicine, ELISA diagnosis is highly correlated with disease in RVA infection (Phillips et al., 2009). Related to this concept is the idea that magnitude of viral shedding (based on Ct value) can help determine disease etiology (Phillips et al., 2009) . Evidence of high viral load in samples tested gives the clinician more confidence that the virus is the cause of the disease process (Izzo et al., 2012) . A high correlation between Ct values \u226425 and clinical disease was found in one human study that compared RVA shedding in clinically healthy subjects versus those with diarrhea (Phillips et al., 2009 ). We found a higher correlation between test methods when we evaluated samples with Ct values \u226425. However, Ct values from different protocols must be interpreted with care because the values may not equate to the same viral load per gram of feces (Phillips et al., 2009) . This was actually seen in this study when comparing between the commercial rtRT-PCR assay and the in-house rtRT-PCR assay, particularly with the positive equine samples. The Ct values obtained by the in-house rtRT-PCR assay were 21 and 18.3, compared to 26.18 and 36.01, respectively, by the commercial rtRT-PCR kit. While we did not have additional equine samples to further examine this, these high Ct values from equine samples are consistent with a previous report (Matthijnssens et al., 2015) in which the same commercial molecular assay was also used for diarrheic samples from equine. Ct values for positive samples from that study ranged from 26.18-36.01. The authors attributed the high Ct values to degradation of the viral RNA in the samples or mild infection. While these are certainly possibilities, these results do raise questions about the sensitivity of this commercial rtRT-PCR assay in the diagnosis of equine RVA. This disparity may potentially be attributed to mismatches in primer and probe binding areas. The designed primers and probe of the in-house rtRT-PCR assay contain several degenerate bases, in an attempt to avoid problems with base mismatches. However, as seen with the sensitivity testing and comparison between the assays, the in-house molecular test was less sensitive that the other molecular assays. Based on the findings in this study when comparing Ct values, it is important to note that the possibility of the significance of lower concentrations of RNA may not be excluded. Ct values can be affected by many factors, not just mismatches in primer/probe binding regions or inappropriate handling and storage of the sample, but also stage of the disease and the quality of the sample collected (Izzo et al., 2012) .",

While it is possible some of the positive samples could have been false positives, we believe it is more likely associated with the increased sensitivity seen with this test, which was demonstrated with side-by-side testing, versus the commercial rtRT-PCR assay, of serial dilutions of nucleic acid from a clinical sample. High sensitivity of RT-iiPCR assays has been consistently demonstrated in previous reports (Ambagala et al., 2015; Balasuriya et al., 2014; Wilkes et al., 2014) . The higher sensitivity may be attributed to the performance of the reaction in gradient temperature that results from the thermal convective phenomena associated with this type of PCR (Krishnan et al., 2002) . This allows primers and probes to anneal to sequences with mismatches (Ambagala et al., 2015) .",

However, rather than obtaining a Ct value that requires interpretation, the portable machine detects the fluorescent signal before and after the reaction and automatically converts it into a positive or negative result. The numerical value for these fluorescent signals can be obtained from the machine for some determination about amount of virus present in the sample, but the sensitivity of the signal does not correlate as well as a threshold cycle value does for real-time PCR. The automated interpretation of the iiPCR machine does however make the method easier to use without the need for advanced training.
