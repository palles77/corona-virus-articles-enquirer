The specific contribution of autophagy to silica-induced inflammation and disease is not known. The objective of these studies was to determine the effects of silica exposure on the autophagic pathway in macrophages, as well as the general contribution of autophagy in macrophages to inflammation and disease. Silica exposure enhanced autophagic activity in vitro in Bone Marrow derived Macrophages and in vivo in Alveolar Macrophages isolated from silicaexposed mice. Impairment of autophagy in myeloid cells in vivo using Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity and inflammation after silica exposure compared to littermate controls, including elevated IL-18 and the alarmin HMGB1 in the whole lavage fluid. Autophagy deficiency caused some spontaneous inflammation and disease. Greater silica-induced acute inflammation in Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice correlated with increased fibrosis and chronic lung disease. These studies demonstrate a critical role for autophagy in suppressing silica-induced cytotoxicity and inflammation in disease development. Furthermore, this data highlights the importance of basal autophagy in macrophages and other myeloid cells in maintaining lung homeostasis.",

Prolonged or enhanced autophagy has also been implicated in cell death (1) . While there are multiple types of autophagy, these studies focus primarily on macroautophagy, which has a fundamental responsibility of sequestering and degrading large macromolecular protein structures and damaged organelles (2) . In the autophagic process, cytosolic microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3-I) is cleaved to the LC3-II isoform and incorporated into the forming autophagosome membrane. Atg5 is a critical protein required for autophagosome elongation and LC3 lipidation (3) . Macromolecular structures are targeted towards the autophagic pathway through hyperubiquitination and the autophagy specific chaperone SQSTM1 (p62) (4) . Targeted material and p62 is sequestered within autophagosomes, which fuse with lysosomes in order to degrade and recycle the target and carrier proteins. Autophagy is reported to be a primary mechanism for degradation of the AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes with poly(dA:dT) or ATP and Nigericin stimulation, respectively, in THP-1 and Bone Marrow derived Macrophages (5) . Therefore, regulating autophagy could possibly have profound implications in macrophage responses to pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic particles such as silica.",

There are few studies investigating the contribution of autophagy to particle-induced lung disease, let alone those caused by exposure to hazardous particulates such as silica. Failure of autophagy to degrade inflammasomes and clear bulk damaged organelles and protein aggregates are thought to contribute to the development of chronic lung disease. However, the state of autophagy appears to vary with different types of chronic lung diseases (7) . Autophagy is reported to be greatly enhanced in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in epithelial cells, while autophagic flux is impaired in isolated alveolar macrophages following cigarette smoke exposure (8, 9) . On the other hand, autophagy is reportedly decreased in bleomycin-induced fibrosis in vivo, and in human Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and Cystic Fibrosis (10, 11) .",

Previous studies have shown that innate immune function is sufficient for the development of fibrosis in a mouse model of silicosis, suggesting a critical role for macrophages in the chronic inflammatory response (13) . A primary mechanism by which silica induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cell death in macrophages is through permeabilization of phagolysosomes (14) . The autophagic pathway also shares lysosomes as a common endpoint for degradation of sequestered material. Correlative findings suggest that loss of lysosomes is associated with increased autophagosomes in lung macrophages as the severity of silicosis increases, and may indicate impaired autophagic degradation (15) . However, it is also possible that increased autophagosome formation is a direct result of cellular injury rather than impaired autophagic flux. Therefore, the consequences of silica exposure on autophagic flux through the lysosome have not been fully elucidated.",

Silica's ability to compromise lysosomal integrity and cause intracellular damage likely has broad impacts on other cell pathways, including autophagy, however this relationship has not been investigated sufficiently. Therefore, to assess the effects of silica exposure on autophagy, we exposed BMdM from GFP-LC3 mice to silica and measured changes in GFP-LC3 expression and puncta formation after 24 hr. BMdM were used for these studies due to their consistency in response with Alveolar Macrophages (AM) in prior studies by our laboratory (17, 24) . Bafilomycin A1 and 3-MA were added to BMdM in order to assess whether silica exposure causes autophagic induction, increased autophagic flux, and/or blocked autophagic flux (25, 26) . Silica exposure caused a marginal increase in median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of GFP-LC3 per cell and a significant increased number of GFP-LC3 puncta/cell ( Figure 1A , 1B, and 1C). 3-MA effectively blocked autophagy in silica-exposed BMdM, indicating silica exposure results in autophagic induction. As expected, Bafilomycin A1 treatment of control cells resulted in an accumulation of GFP-LC3. When Bafilomycin A1 was added to silica-exposed cells, there was an increase in GFP-LC3 when compared to Bafilomycin A1 only treated cells, which further supports the notion that silica exposure is increasing autophagosome formation but not necessarily blocking autophagic flux through the lysosome.",

            "text": "Autophagy has been reported to be a primary mechanism for the degradation of assembled inflammasomes (5) . Consequently, autophagy can potentially regulate the secretion of inflammasome-associated cytokines. The role of autophagy in regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activity following exposure to silica has not been previously described. Additionally, autophagy is generally regarded as a cell survival mechanism, and may act to prevent silica-induced cytotoxicity. In order to test the role of autophagy in silica-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activity and cell death, we generated BMdM from Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice, which are deficient in autophagosome formation. Though Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice have been utilized by multiple other groups (16, 20, 29, 30) , we confirmed BMdM generated from these mice exhibited impaired autophagy to establish reproducibility of the model. This included determining Atg5 depletion (data not shown) and defective lipidation of LC3-I to LC3-II (Supplemental Figure 2A) . This was consistent with isolated AM (Supplemental Figure 2B) . We then exposed BMdM generated from littermate control and Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice to silica and LPS, which was added simultaneously with the particle in order to prime the NLRP3 inflammasome and cause cytokine production over 24 hr. Silica exposure did not significantly increase extracellular IL-1\u03b2 levels in BMdM cultures from Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice when compared to littermate controls ( Figure 3A ). However, there was spontaneous (background) release of IL-1\u03b2 at low levels from non silica-exposed autophagy deficient BMdM. This suggested some basal level of NLRP3 inflammasome activity in macrophages in which autophagy is impaired. Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + macrophages were more susceptible to cell death than littermate controls, as indicated by increased LDH in cell supernatants following silica exposure ( Figure 3B ). HMGB1 release has been associated with NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cell death with bacterial infection, and exposure to carbon nanotubes (21, 31) . We observed increased HMGB1 release from silica exposed Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + BMdM compared to silica-exposed littermate controls ( Figure 3C ). Autophagy deficiency did not decrease or enhance particle uptake (data not shown). Therefore, we suspect greater HMGB1 release was due to more cell death. This data is consistent with the notion that autophagy functions to prevent silicainduced cytotoxicity, and supports the proposal that autophagy deficiency results in some spontaneous NLRP3 inflammasome activity.",

Silica exposure resulted in significant increases in total protein, HMGB1, and IL-18 in the lavage fluid of Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice compared to silica-exposed littermate controls ( Figure 4A , 4B, 4C). IL-1\u03b2 was not significantly increased in Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mouse lavage fluid compared to silica-exposed littermate controls, but was significantly increased over PBSexposed animals ( Figure 4D ). We observed some spontaneous (background) IL-18 production in Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice ( Figure 4C ). Consistent with our findings in BMdM exposed to silica in vitro, LDH levels were greater in the lavage fluid of Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice compared to littermate controls ( Figure 4E ). Extracellular Cathepsin activity was also increased in autophagy deficient mice compared to littermate controls, though not significantly ( Figure 4F ). These data support the notion that depletion of autophagy in macrophages causes some basal NLRP3 inflammasome activity. Furthermore, the observation that inflammation and cytotoxicity (LDH) were exacerbated in Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice demonstrates a fundamental role for autophagic suppression of silica-induced lung injury.",

We also observed increased cell numbers, mainly due to increased neutrophils in the Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice ( Figure 5A ) suggesting background cellular inflammation. Neutrophil influx in PBS-exposed Atg fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice correlated with elevated CXCL1 in the lavage fluid ( Figure 5B ). Other investigators have reported similar observations, as well as elevated levels of IL-1\u03b1 (16, 29) . However, we did not observe increased IL-1\u03b1 in the whole lung lavage fluid of Atg fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice, and there was no significant difference in IL-1\u03b1 after silica exposure between autophagy deficient and littermate control mice ( Figure 5C ). This discrepancy could be due to differences in amounts in the lung lavage fluid or more likely the interstitial/intracellular levels assayed with whole lung homogenization used in the other studies (16) . During differential analysis, we noticed that AM from Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice were much larger than those observed in littermate controls ( Figure 5D ), which may indicate further differences in macrophage activity and phenotype. This data highlights the importance of macrophage-associated autophagy in maintaining homeostasis, and that knocking out autophagy in macrophages results in an unusual basal phenotype that may contribute to greater inflammation following particle exposure.",

An primary role for autophagy is to sequester and degrade inflammasomes and inflammasome cytokines such as pro-IL-1\u03b2 (5, 26, 32) . Therefore, autophagic stimulation is being investigated as a potential therapeutic target for chronic inflammatory conditions. Ineffective autophagic suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activity may, in part, be a mechanism contributing to chronic NLRP3 inflammasome activity with silica exposure. We initially hypothesized that silica-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activity would be due, in part, to impaired autophagic flux through the lysosome. This has been reported to be the case for rare-earth nanomaterials (33) . There is some evidence of altered autophagic activity with silica exposure in vivo, including an accumulation of p62 within granulomas (34), though a very high dose of silica was used in those studies. Others reported that autophagy is impaired in isolated human lung AM from individuals with silicosis, including increased levels of LC3, p62, and Beclin-1 (15). In the same study, autophagy alteration by silica was suggested to contribute to AM sensitization to LPS stimulation, though exactly how this occurs was not clear. Our data showing increased LC3-II, p62, and total ubiquitination in vitro and vivo are consistent with reports in human AM (Figure 1 and 2) . We were also able to show that 3-MA effectively inhibited silicainduced autophagy (Figure 1 ), indicating that silica-exposure is causing autophagic induction. Secondly, through inhibiting lysosomal activity with Bafilomycin A1, we demonstrated further accumulation of autophagic carrier proteins (Figure 1) , which supports the hypothesis that the primary outcome of silica exposure on the autophagic pathway is induction and not necessarily impaired autophagic flux. Silica exposure is known to induce lysosome membrane permeabilization (LMP), which can result NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cytotoxicity (14) . Increased autophagy following silica exposure may be a mechanism to mitigate the cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory outcomes of LMP.",

Others have utilized this mouse model to test the role of myeloid cell-mediated autophagy in inflammation and disease burden with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (16) . In that report, inflammation and disease were significantly enhanced in Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice compared to littermate controls. A second study by different investigators reported enhanced inflammation and disease with LPS and/or Bleomycin induced lung injury in Atg7 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice, which are also defective in autophagosome formation (29) . We observed significantly greater levels of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-18 and HMGB1 ( Figure 5 ), increased extracellular LDH, and chronic disease ( Figure 6 ) in Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice with silica exposure. The studies strongly support an integral role for autophagy as an important mechanism in suppressing cell death with silica exposure as well as mitigating NLRP3 inflammasome activity.",

            "text": "Two additional important findings in this study include the observation that silica exposure increases IL-18 and HMGB1 (Figure 4) , and release of these pro-inflammatory mediators is enhanced in autophagy deficient mice. HMGB1 is a nuclear architectural protein that is actively secreted from macrophages with active NLRP3 inflammasomes, and is passively released from dead or dying cells (30, 35, 36) . Extracellular HMGB1 acts as a Danger Associated Molecular Pattern, and can contribute to sterile priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome (37) . Exacerbated HMGB1 levels in the lavage fluid of silica-exposed Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice are consistent with increased cell injury ( Figure 3B, 4E) . The observation that Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + have increased neutrophil numbers at baseline ( Figure  5 ), and high levels of HMGB1 after silica exposure could be due, in part, to more neutrophil cell death, though this was not investigated in these studies. Furthermore, HMGB1 secretion has been observed in models of oxidative stress, and oxidative stress is known to occur with silica exposure (38, 39) . Consequently, increased extracellular HMGB1 in these studies may be directly associated with elevated oxidative stress. The presence of high levels of both IL-18 and HMGB1 in autophagy deficient mice, and greater chronic disease, indicate that these two inflammatory mediators could contribute more to particle-induced chronic lung disease than appreciated. IL-1R null mice exposed to Multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes (another particle that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome), while protected from excessive acute inflammation, develop more severe chronic disease (40) . These studies indicate that IL-1R signaling may not be as important in chronic disease, but rather other signals including IL-18 and/or HMGB1 could be more important contributors to chronic pathology. This notion is further supported by the fact that we observed spontaneous IL-18 release and some lung pathology in PBS-exposed autophagy deficient mice ( Figure 4C , Figure 6B ). Under normal physiological conditions, a cytosolic pool of IL-18 is maintained (41) . This may explain why IL-18 was the predominant cytokine released from Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice in our studies (41) . Others have also reported increased neutrophils, IL-18, and spontaneous disease at baseline in Atg7 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice (29) . IL-18 neutralizing antibodies but not Anakinra, the IL-1R antagonist, were effective at reducing spontaneous disease in Atg7 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice. This may likely be true for Atg5 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mice, though this was not determined. Finally, IL-18 and HMGB1 have been implicated in autoimmune disorders such as SLE, which has greater prevalence among individuals with silicosis (42, 43) . Further studies will be needed to elucidate the role of HMGB1 and IL-18 in silica-induced lung inflammation and its subsequent contribution to systemic disease.",

Knocking out Atg5, which is required for autophagosome formation, causes enhanced acute inflammation (predominantly HMGB1 and IL-18 release), increased cell death, and exacerbated chronic disease. Furthermore, Atg5 depletion causes spontaneous NLRP3 inflammasome activity and disease, with IL-18 being the predominant NLRP3 inflammasome cytokine being released. These studies show the importance of autophagy in macrophages in suppressing silica-induced inflammation and cytotoxicity that drive chronic disease, and in maintaining lung homeostasis. The mechanisms described in these studies may also be critical for suppression of inflammation and disease following exposure to other NLRP3 inflammasome activating particles including asbestos, uric acid crystals, cholesterol crystals, and engineered nanoparticles, and supports future studies of the role of autophagy with exposure to these agents.",
