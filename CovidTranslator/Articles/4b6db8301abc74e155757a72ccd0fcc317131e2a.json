The pseudoknot was proposed as a potentially widespread motif by Pleij et al. (1985) and several pieces of experimental data are consistent with its presence in some messenger, ribosomal, and viral RNAs (see also Rietveld et al., 1983) . The present programs for energy minimization of predicted secondary structures exclude the pseudoknot motif (Zucker, 1989) but once it was recognized as at least a formal possibility, examples began to appear. Most recently, two papers describe experiments that not only support the presence of pseudoknot structures in different mRNAs, but also give evidence that these structures are specifically recognized by components of the translation apparatus (Tang and Draper, 1989; Brierley et al., 1989) . A third and earlier study proposed that an RNA pseudoknot is recognized by a DNA binding protein that autogenously regulates translation of its mRNA (McPheeters et al., 1988) .",

As anticipated, it confirmed the pattern of hydrogen bonds in the cloverleaf secondary structure that was predicted from the sequence. Unexpectedly, it also revealed that the singlestranded loops in the proposed cloverleaf secondary structure are not passive elements. Instead, they bear nucleotides that are sites for the sophisticated interactions that stabilize the highly differentiated tertiary structure. These interactions include hydrogen bonds that connect the dihydrouridine loop to the T$ and variable loops. The structure also revealed that the four helical stems of the cloverleaf are stacked in pairs to form two longer, continuous helices which are arranged at approximately right angles to form an L-shaped molecule.",

The second stem can be stacked upon the first to form a continuous coaxial helix. Thus, the hydrogen-bonded articulation of bases in a loop with bases in another part of the RNA, and the coaxial stacking of short helical stems to form a single longer helix, are general themes in tRNAs that are reiterated in pseudoknots. However, the pseudoknot has an added complexity that is not observed in tRNAs: the coaxial stacking of helices requires that singlestranded connecting nucleotides cross the grooves of the RNA double helix ( Figure 1B) . From a three-dimensional model it is clear that one crossing, over the deep groove, can be accomplished with two nucleotide units. The other crossing, over the shallow groove, requires (for a bridge of two nucleotides) a perturbation of the normal helical and, additionally or alternatively, bridging mononucleotide conformational parameters.",

In the proposed structure, three nucleotides bridge across the major groove and two are used to cross the minor groove. Strong evidence for the pseudoknot structure was obtained. The thermodynamic stabilities and hypochromicities of the pseudoknot, of a sequence variant that could not form one of the stems of the pseudoknot, and of the individual stems were investigated. These data showed that the stacking enthalpy was higher for the pseudoknot than for the molecules that contained the individual stems, although not as high as expected for a structure with seven contiguous base pairs. This observation and the reduced hypochromicity of the pseudoknot suggest a distortion in stem and loop portions which could be caused by the presumed two-base crossing of the minor groove.",

Thus, tobacco mosaic virus RNA, turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV), and brome mosaic virus RNAs are aminoacylated specifically with histidine, valine, and tyrosine, respectively, and each is recognized by the tRNA nucleotidyl transferase, which adds the CCA sequence at the 3'terminus of all tRNA molecules (reviewed in Haenni et al., 1982) . Figure 2A shows how the four stems of the tRNA cloverleaf are combined into two continuous helices that constitute the two arms of the L-shaped three-dimensional structure. The acceptor-T6 stems form one continuous minihelix of 12 bp. Seven of these pairs are derived from the acceptor and five from the TI$ helix. The problem is how to form an equivalent minihelix from sequences, for example, at the 3'terminus of TYMV RNA. A conventional secondary structure analysis suggested that this segment encodes two stem-loop segments with 5 and 4 bp, respectively. However, by implementation of the pseudoknot format, the desired 12 bp minihelix can be constructed ( Figure 28 ) and combined with adjoining sequences to form a tRNA-like structure (not shown).",

This is because the major determinant for the identity of an alanine tRNA is a single base pair that is located in the acceptor helix, so that the rest of the tRNA structure is dispensable for aminoacylation (Hou and Schimmel, 1988; Francklyn and Schimmel, 1989) .

The mutant RNAs were synthesized by enzymatic methods and assayed directly for S4 binding in vitro (Tang and Draper, 1989) .",

A change of this magnitude could be due to perturbation of a van der Waals interaction.

Alternatively, the interactions of a operon mRNA with S4 may be distributed over many sites in the structure, so that any given alteration produces only a small change in affinity. It is noteworthy that one of the mutations that disrupts a base pair in the proposed pseudoknot structure cannot be rescued by a second site mutation which restores pairing. This could be a site where S4 interacts directly with a specific base pair, and contributes a small incremental stability to the complex. Ongoing experiments will assess the relationship between alterations that disrupt the pseudoknot-dependent protein-RNA interaction in vitro and the extent of translational repression in vivo. Regardless of the detailed interpretation of the experiments, the analysis of RNA structure by these methods is instructive and has provided one of the first examples of a functional probe for pseudoknot formation.",

Operationally there is simultaneous -1 slippage of a UUA-reading tRNALeU (bound to the ribosomal A-site) and an AA&reading tRNAAsn (bound to the P-site), which results in a double frameshift. In the -1 position these tRNAs are proposed to read their respective codons by two instead of three bases.

Two long open reading frames overlap by 42 nucleotides, with the second frame shifted by -1 relative to the first. A -1 frameshift results in the production of a fusion protein. An 86 nucleotide element that spans the overlap region is sufficient to promote frameshifting, even in a heterologous context. This element encodes a stem-loop structure that starts six nucleotides downstream from the proposed site of frameshifting, near the end of the first reading frame. Located 30 nucleotides further downstream from the 3' end of the putative stem is a sequence of seven bases that are complementary to the hairpin loop. Thus, the overlap region encodes a sequence that could fold into a pseudoknot. Support for the pseudoknot structure was sought by analysis of mutants that alternately disrupt and restore the proposed structure. Mutations that disrupt either stem of the pseudoknot severely reduce frameshifting, while compensatory mutations that restore the pseudoknot also restore frameshifting. The pseudoknot inferred by this analysis is a quasicontinuous helix of 16 bp, and the necessary bridging by unpaired bases across the deep and shallow grooves is sterically feasible. Of the retrovirus and related systems suspected to use -1 frameshifting, Brierley et al. (1989) found that over half have the potential for pseudoknot formation immediately downstream of the lo-cation of the frameshift. This includes three of the four systems where frameshifting has actually been confirmed. It is perhaps significant that Jacks et al. (1988) had shown that frameshifting is attenuated upon deletion of a region downstream of the critical stem in Rous sarcoma virus mRNA.",

Mechanisms for frameshifting with natural as opposed to mutant tRNAs have been studied in bacteria and eukaryotes (reviewed in Roth, 1981; Craigen and Caskey, 1987) . In bacteria, frameshift suppression can occur as a result of translational pausing, which is caused, for example, by starvation for an amino acid. In this case, frameshifting results from the use of a surrogate charged tRNA in place of the correct charged species (which is in limiting amounts). Thus, a transiently unoccupied A-site on the ribosome may be \"read\" by a noncognate tRNA and that event can be accompanied by a frameshift and a missense substitution. The frameshifts that lead to fusion proteins in the retroviral and IBV examples are different in that the double frameshift event is not accompanied by missense substitutions. This suggests that a pseudoknot does not simply produce an unoccupied A-site.",
