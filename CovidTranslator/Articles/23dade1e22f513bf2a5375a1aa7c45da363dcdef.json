            "text": "Results of a clinical study using intravenous (IV) ribavirin for treating Department of Defense personnel with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) acquired in Korea from 1987 to 2005 were reviewed to determine the clinical course of HFRS treated with IV ribavirin. A total of 38 individuals enrolled in the study had subsequent serological confirmation of HFRS. Four of the 38 individuals received three or fewer doses of ribavirin and were excluded from treatment analysis. Of the remaining 34 individuals, oliguria was present in one individual at treatment initiation; none of the remaining 33 subjects developed oliguria or required dialysis. The mean peak serum creatinine was 3.46 mg/dl and occurred on day 2 of ribavirin therapy. Both the peak serum creatinine and the onset of polyuria occurred on mean day 6.8 of illness. Reversible hemolytic anemia was the main adverse event of ribavirin, with a \u226525% decrease in hematocrit observed in 26/34 (76.5%) individuals. While inability to adjust for all baseline variables prevents comparison to historical cohorts in Korea where oliguria has been reported in 39-69% cases and dialysis required in approximately 40% HFRS cases caused by Hantaan virus, the occurrence of 3% oliguria and 0% dialysis requirement in the treatment cohort is supportive of a previous placebo-controlled HFRS trial in China where IV ribavirin given early resulted in decreased occurrence of oliguria and decreased severity of renal insufficiency.",

Hantaan virus, carried by the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius), is seen primarily in rural areas and associated with a more severe form of disease, with a mortality rate ranging from 1.5% to 12% in Korea (Lee, 1991; Bruno et al., 1990; Kim et al., 2006) . Seoul virus, carried by domestic rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus), is responsible for urban cases of HFRS. Seoul virus is generally associated with a less severe form of disease, with a mortality rate of less than 1%. HFRS disease is characterized by fever, headache, abdominal and/or back pain, renal insufficiency, and mild manifestations of hemorrhage. Disease may manifest as five clinical phases of illness: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, polyuric, and convalescent phases (Lee, 1991; Bruno et al., 1990; Kim et al., 2006) . Nearly all individuals present with a febrile illness, 11-40% persons develop hypotension and 40-60% develop oliguria (urine output less than 400 ml per day, generally lasting 3-7 days).

A decrease in mortality was observed in ribavirin-treated subjects [2.5% (3/125) versus 8.5% (10/117) in non-ribavirin treated controls], which was a sevenfold decrease in mortality when adjusted for baseline variables (dialysis not available in this study). The mechanism by which ribavirin prevented death was most likely due to prevention of oliguria, as 12 of the 13 deaths were associated with prolonged oliguria. While the antiviral activity of IV ribavirin may be due to multiple mechanisms, recent data suggest ribavirin may exert its primary activity against Hantaan virus by serving as a RNA virus mutagen resulting in an \"extinction catastrophe\" error, as a result of incorporation in the viral RNA genome (Huggins, 1989; Chung et al., 2007) .",

However, in a cohort comprised of Republic of Korea (ROK) military troops (mainly young adult males) hospitalized on mean day 4 of illness with HFRS at a medical referral center with dialysis capability and experienced clinicians between 2000 and 2004, oliguria was observed in 24/61 (39%) and dialysis was required in 23/61 (38%) Table 7 Review of occurrence of oliguria, dialysis requirement, mean time of peak serum creatinine, severity of renal failure, and death in the IV ribavirin-treated HFRS cohort vs. historical non-ribavirin-treated HFRS controls in Korea. individuals (Kim et al., 2006) (Table 7) . The time of onset of symptoms to admission was similar in the oliguric and non-oliguric groups. Most individuals who developed oliguria (21/24 (87.5%)) subsequently required dialysis: only 2 of 37 (5.4%) non-oliguric persons required dialysis. The mean peak serum creatinine in the 24 oliguric patients was 10.8 mg/dl, and did not occur until mean day 9.3 of illness (range days 6-13). The onset of oliguria occurred on mean day 5.5 of illness (range days 3-8) and lasted a mean duration of 4.9 days (range 1-11 days). The 37 non-oliguric patients had a mean peak serum creatinine of 4.7 mg/dl occurring on mean day 7.6 of illness (range days 5-12). While 40% of HFRS cases had received a hantavirus vaccine, a protective effect of the vaccine on preventing oliguria was not observed. The experience of this ROK cohort reported by Kim was similar to an earlier unvaccinated HFRS cohort (comprised of 124 patients admitted to Central Army Hospital in 1979 and 104 patients to Seoul National University Hospital in 1988), with oliguria reported in 60% of HFRS cases due to Hantaan virus and dialysis required in 40% of cases (creatinine values were greater than 10 mg/dl in 42% cases) (Lee, 1991) (Table 7) . The onset of oliguria in HFRS from Hantaan virus generally occurred on days 6-8 of illness, and lasted 3-5 days (range 1-16 days). The peak serum creatinine generally was not observed until days 7-12 of illness, with the onset of polyuria late in the second week of illness (days 9-14 of illness). In this same publication, HFRS due to Seoul virus was associated with oliguria in 50% of patients, with dialysis required in 20% cases (serum creatinine greater than 10 mg/dl in 17% cases).",

A trend toward an increased platelet count and a decrease in hemorrhagic manifestations of disease was observed in ribavirin-treated HFRS patients compared to non-ribavirin treated controls (Huggins et al., 1991) . Thrombocytosis attributed to ribavirin was observed in rhesus macaques with Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) treated with IV ribavirin (McKee et al., 1988) . Studies suggest the mechanism for the increased platelet count was stimulation of platelet production, based on the increase in megakaroctyes and ploidy observed in ribavirin-treated macaques. As aggregation studies suggested platelet function was normal, an increase in normal-functioning platelets could result in a potential hemostasis benefit in HFRS.",

Other cardiac abnormalities reported with HFRS include nonspecific cardiac conduction abnormalities, atrial fibrillation, junctional bradycardia, first and second degree atrioventricular (AV) block, premature atrial and ventricular contractions, sinus tachycardia, depressed left ventricular function, and myocarditis (Markotic et al., 2002; Puljiz et al., 2005; Chun and Godfrey, 1984; Pal et al., 2005; Basin et al., 1992; Liu et al., 2002; Katetanovic et al., 1992; Pimenov et al., 2002) . While EKG abnormalities have been reported in 30/79 (38%) cases of HFRS acquired in Croatia (either from Dobrava or Puumala viruses), electrolyte and metabolic disturbances were not found to be statistically different in patients with abnormal EKGs (Puljiz et al., 2005) . Autopsy reports demonstrating cardiac findings of hemorrhage and edema (mainly in the right atrium) and mononuclear cell infiltrates (mainly in the left atrium but throughout the heart) (Lukes, 1954; Hullinghorst and Steer, 1953; Kessler, 1953) suggest cardiac abnormalities may be a direct effect of the hantavirus.",

Ribavirin was not associated with cardiotoxicity or cardiac effects in preclinical animal trials involving dogs, monkeys, or rats (myocarditis was observed in an initial study but not in the four subsequent studies in rats) (ribavirin investigator brochure, 1989).

Patients with SARS receiving IV ribavirin were not at increased risk for pancreatitis or elevated pancreatic enzymes on a multivariate analysis, although elevated amylase levels (not pancreatitis) occurred more frequently in a univariate analysis (Muller et al., 2007) . Hyperamylasemia and pancreatitis were observed in both seronegative and seropositive individuals given IV ribavirin for possible HPS, suggesting either enrollment bias or a drug induced etiology (Chapman et al., 1999; Chiou et al., 2005) . Pancreatic enzymes should be followed in individuals with HFRS, and discontinuation of ribavirin may be considered in persons who develop pancreatitis.",

Mild hyperuricemia has been associated with ribavirin, possibly reflecting metabolism of ribavirin to urates (Investigator Brochure, 2004) . While uric acid levels in this cohort were commonly \u226510 mg/dl and as high as 27 mg/dl, no subject developed symptoms from hyperuricemia. Retrospective analysis of cohorts of SARS showed patients receiving IV ribavirin were statistically more likely to develop hypomagnesemia, and possibly hypocalcemia, suggesting IV ribavirin may perhaps potentiate hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia (Muller et al., 2007; McEvoy et al., 2004) .",

The ethical concerns for performing a second placebo-controlled trial may also be addressed by this study, as death rates in this cohort were similar to non-ribavirin treated HFRS cohorts in Korea with dialysis availability, suggesting dialysis may prevent deaths related to severe renal insufficiency that were possibly prevented by IV ribavirin in the China study. The main adverse event from IV ribavirin was reversible hemolytic anemia, which is common and may be severe. The association of ribavirin with adverse events of hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperuricemia, pancreatitis, and bradycardia is unclear, as these abnormalities are also complications of HFRS. This study supports the need for a randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess IV ribavirin in treating HFRS and to support FDA approval of the drug.",
