There have been numerous studies that have reported that T cells serve major roles in tumor progression. However, the function of CXC motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) in prostate cancer remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the role of CXCL9 in prostate cancer. A prostate cancer mouse model was generated by treating C57/BL-6 and B6.Cg-Selplgtm1Fur/J mice with 3,2'-dimethyl 4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB). Hematoxylin and eosin staining detected the histopathological alterations of mouse prostate tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining determined cell proliferation of the mice. Flow cytometry was used to detect the alterations of T cells in C57+DMAB or CXCL9+DMAB mice. Immunofluorescence revealed that there was positive expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 in the mouse tissues. The survival rates of C57+DMAB and CXCL9+DMAB mice was analyzed. The association of CXCL9 expression and clinical stages was also evaluated. Results revealed that prostate cancer pathology and cell proliferation in CXCL9+DMAB mice were significantly greater compared with the C57+DMAB mice. Compared with C57+DMAB mice, the number of T cells in peripheral blood and spleen of CXCL9+DMAB mice was significantly reduced. IHC demonstrated that the expression of IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 was significantly downregulated in the CXCL9+DMAB mice. The survival rate of CXCL9+DMAB mice was significantly decreased compared with the C57+DMAB mice. In addition, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that CXCL9 mRNA expression in clinical samples was positively associated with clinical pathological stages of prostate cancer. In conclusion, CXCL9 may promote prostate cancer progression via inhibition of cytokines from T cells.",

In regions such as Europe and the United States, prostate cancer is the most common male malignancy; the mortality rate has exceeded lung cancer. The incidence of prostate cancer has gradually increased with the arrival of China's aging population and the extension of life and diet changes (1) . It is also known that prostate cancer-associated fatalities frequently occur in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Although several novel drugs for castration-resistant prostate cancer have been approved, each of these has prolonged survival by just a few months. Therefore, novel treatments of prostate cancer are required to extend life expectancy even further.",

Several strategies, including cancer vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors, have been investigated in clinical studies for cancer patients (3) (4) (5) . However, T cell immunotherapy of prostate cancer is still at an early stage of clinical development. It has been reported that several molecules are potent T cell checkpoint inhibitors which reverse immunologic tolerance in many types of cancer, including prostate cancer (6) . Therefore, the molecules which serve crucial roles in T cell activity during prostate cancer may be useful for the treatment of this disease. CXC motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) is a chemo-9 (CXCL9) is a chemo-9 (CXCL9) is a chemokine, which regulates the host's response to inflammation by recruiting leukocytes to the inflammatory environment. Chemokines serve important roles in immune responses of the body. Chemokines are expressed by almost all monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and natural killer (NK) cells but are expressed to a lesser degree by macrophages, B cells and T cells (7) (8) (9) . It has been reported that the absence of CXCL9 affects leukocyte migration and tissue infiltration (10) . As CXCL9 has the ability to interact with a variety of ligands, it serves a certain biological role in the inflammatory response. In addition, inflammation is closely associated with the occurrence and development of tumors (11, 12) . The present study aimed to investigate the effect of CXCL9 on T cells in prostate cancer.",

H&E staining (Fig. 1A) revealed that the prostate cancer pathology of CXCL9-overexpressed mice was significantly greater than C57 mice and CXCL9-overexpressed mice had developed differentiated adenocarcinoma at 20 weeks. The nuclear staining was significantly greater, the ducts were irregular and glandular cavity became smaller (black arrows). At 24 weeks, CXCL9-overexpressed mice exhibited a clear pathology of prostate cancer with a neuroendocrine differentiation phenotype (Fig. 1A) . Therefore, the mice at 24 weeks were selected for subsequent experiments. Immunohistochemical staining (magnification, x400) of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) revealed that proliferation levels in CXCL9+DMAB mice were increased compared with C57+DMAB mice (Fig. 1B) .
