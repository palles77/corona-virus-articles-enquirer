Fermented bacteria are harvested using a hollow fibermembrane module and pre-treated with lysozyme prior to passing through a thermal exchange coil set at 70 1C to lyse the cells, and into a juxtaposed cooling coil on ice. The lysed and cooled bacteria are subsequently separated from the lysate by centrifugation and plasmid DNA is precipitated from the supernatant for further purification. The use of peristaltic pumps and two heating coils at constant temperature without the use of centrifugation enable the lysis process to become constant and controllable, providing a flow-through protocol for cell lysis and plasmid DNA extraction. Large volumes of bacterial cultures (20 l) can be processed in 2 h, yielding approximately 100 mg plasmid DNA l -1 culture, making this an attractive protocol for consistent and large-scale preparation of plasmid DNA.",

These recombinant bacterial strains will replicate the plasmid, producing large quantities of the target DNA 6 . A typical process of plasmid DNA generation includes the construction and selection of appropriate expression vectors, production of recombinant microorganisms and cell growth, followed by lysis of the cells, and the extraction and purification of plasmid DNA 7 . When the plasmids are extracted and purified, they usually result in one of two forms: either opencircled or supercoiled. However, when they are used in gene therapy or vaccine immunization, the plasmid with the supercoiled form is preferred. During plasmid DNA extraction, the step of lysing bacterial cells without losing plasmids is probably the most critical for downstream processing 8 , as the quantity of plasmid DNA recovered is mostly determined by this step after fermentation 9, 10 .",

Centrifugation on a fixed-angle rotor is the most common operation during this process 12, 13 and is a rate-limiting step for a large-scale preparation 14 . An alternative method is boiling lysis, in which the 100 1C thermal treatment disrupts and makes cells release the plasmid DNA 15 . Although boiling lysis can isolate more plasmids than alkaline lysis, the inconsistent plasmid yield and purity, and the difficulty in operation, make this method undesirable even for laboratory research-scale preparations 16 . For large-scale production, a high-pressure homogenizer is used to continuously disrupt cells 17 . However, this often causes problems in collecting fragmented DNA plasmids and more contaminated genomic DNA due to its severe fluid dynamic forces for destruction 17 .

            "text": "Based on the conventional boiling lysis protocol 18 , Lee and Lander have made several modifications to improve the method 19, 20 . Although these modifications significantly improve the efficiency of boiling lysis and the yield of plasmid DNA, they require centrifugation steps at the bacterial-collecting and plasmidextracting stage, special equipment and reagents. In a recent report 21 , we described a design for a flow-through protocol from cultured bacteria for the extraction of plasmid DNA. The schematic design of the device and set-up is shown in Figure 1 . The use of a 0.2 mm pore size hollow fiber-membrane module to harvest the fermented bacteria will minimize the centrifugation step, which is one of the limiting steps in large-scale preparation. Pumping through the heat-exchanging coils, cells receive uniform thermal treatment regardless of the volume of the sample, which ensures continuity and homogeneity of cell lysis. The diameter of copper coils can vary, depending on the volume of fermentation. This provides versatility for any given volume of samples. This protocol does not aim to increase the yield of plasmid, but to provide consistency between batches, which can otherwise be lacking in boiling lysis methods. A centrifugation step is, however, still required to separate the plasmid-containing supernatant from the lysed bacteria, which will require further optimization. Overall, this protocol provides a scalable, efficient and cost-effective preparation system to meet the needs of large-scale plasmid production for both laboratories and industry. The protocol mainly details the lysis of cells and the extraction of plasmid DNA, and although further purification procedures may be required, they are not explained in detail within this protocol. . Plasmid DNA m CRITICAL The following plasmids have been extracted using this protocol: pcDNA3, pGEX-4T-1, pVAX1 and pcD-VP1. The latter, encoding a capsid protein VP1 (639 bp) of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV; described previously 22 ) , was extensively used during the optimization of this protocol.",

As indicated in Figure 2 , the temperatures of 70 1C and 80 1C achieved a higher yield of plasmids with a minimum contamination with genomic DNA.

The waste liquid is discharged via an outlet valve (V2) into a waste container (C1). After closing the outlet valve V2, the concentrated cells are pumped from the top outlet of the module into a cell collection container (C2), where the cells are adjusted to the OD 600 nm of 100 by TE and treated with lysozyme before being pumped into the thermal exchange coils by a second peristaltic pump (P2); cells first pass through a thermal exchange coil (A) in a 70 1C water bath (C3) for continual thermal lysis, and are then immediately pumped through a second thermal exchange coil (B) in an ice bath (C4) and are collected in a container, which is also in the ice bath. After thermal treatment, lysed cells are centrifuged and the supernatant is mixed with 0.6 volume of isopropanol and 1/10 volume of NaOAc in container C5.
