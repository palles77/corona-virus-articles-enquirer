            "text": "The nsp14 protein, an exoribonuclease of the DEDD superfamily encoded by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was expressed in fusion with different affinity tags. The recombinant nsp14 proteins with either GST fusion or 6-histidine tag were shown to possess ribonuclease activity but nsp14 with a short MGHHHHHHGS tag sequence at the N-terminus increased the solubility of nsp14 protein and facilitated the protein purification. Mutations of the conserved residues of nsp14 resulted in significant attenuation but not abolishment of the ribonuclease activity. Combination of fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy analyses showed that the conformational stability of nsp14 protein varied with many external factors such as pH, temperature and presence of denaturing chemicals. These results provide new information on the structural features and would be helpful for further characterization of this functionally important protein.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the causative agent for the epidemic in year 2002 [1] [2] [3] . It is a positive-strand RNA virus whose gene expression and genome replication require polyprotein synthesis and subgenomic production [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Coronavirus replication requires several viral encoded proteins, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, endoribonuclease, as well as a unique exoribonuclease [7, [9] [10] , The possible role of this exoribonuclease of SARS-CoV, nsp14, in the virus replication is reported [5, 9] . Although it has been proposed that nspl4 may play a role in the proof-reading, RNA repair and/or recombination for maintaining the integrity of the unusually large RNA genome of coronaviruses [7] , the actual biological function of nsp14 involved in viral RNA replication is still unknown. To gain more insight into the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of nsp14, further characterization of its biochemical and conformational properties is needed.",

The GST-nsp14 contained a large part of GST fusion while HTL-nsp14 carried a 6 \u00d7 His tag with a long vector sequence. As shown in Fig. 1b , GST-nsp14 protein showed 30% solubility when expressed at 20 \u00b0 C (lanes 2-3 in Fig. 1b ) and it could be purified by GST-affinity chromatography (lane 4 in Fig. 1b) . To obtain an intact protein without extra sequence, we used thrombin protease to remove the GST tag after purification but the protein became easily to aggregate in solution after losing the GST tag (data not shown). The HTL-nsp14 protein with His6 tag and a long linker sequence from the vector at the N-terminus was produced mostly in the form of inclusion body and was poorly purified by Ni-NTA affinity column (lanes 6-8 in Fig. 1c ).",

A significant increase in yield and solubility (about 50%) was observed with HT-nsp14 (lanes 10-11 in Fig. 1d ). After initial purification on a Ni-NTA affinity column, the purity of HT-nsp14 reached 90%, and with an additional step of gel filtration chromatography on Superdex-75 column (Amersham, Inc), the protein was purified to near homogeneity (lanes 12-13 in Fig. 1d ). This tag is very small, which does not need removal of the tag during the further structural and functional studies, in fact for structural studies, more than 60% of the proteins produced include a polyhistidine tag, and many examples of proteins crystallized with His-tag left intact are reported [13] . At the same time, Gly-Ser-coding sequences can be made to contain Bam HI or Bgl II sites and this can facilitate the cloning work. During the following experiments, the analyses of the conformational stability of nsp14 were performed with HT-nsp14.",

We carried out the point mutations of the four residues, D5992/E5994, D6145, and H6170, all to Ala, to examine the functional role of these residues. The results showed that each mutation had significant impact on the enzymatic activity and all mutants displayed significantly lower ribonuclease activity than the wildtype protein ( Fig. 3b and 3c) , demonstrating the critical rote of these conserved residues. Nonetheless, all these mutants still retained low level of exoribonuclease activity, and a complete abolishment of the activity may require a combination of two or more of these mutations. ",

This red shifting may be explained in terms of increased exposure of Trp residues to solvent, resulting from the process of protein denaturation [23, 25] . The red shift in emission maxima was also accompanied by an increase in the half-maximal spectral width of the fluorescence spectra (Fig. 4b) . This increase was largely due to the emergence and contribution of tyrosine residues to the emission spectrum upon denaturation and the formation of more conformationally altered species during the denaturation process [26] .",

Incubation of nsp14 at increasing concentrations of GuHCl resulted in a progressive change of intrinsic fluorescence emission to a longer wavelength, 354 nm ( Fig. 4c and 4d ). This is due to the fact that the Trp residue, which is partly buried in the native form, is exposed on the surface in the denatured protein. At GuHCl concentrations higher than 4 M the fluorescence intensity measured at 343 nm drops to about 40% of its value observed in solutions with no GuHCl present (Fig. 4c) . This decrease of fluorescence intensity obviously results from the denaturation of protein and may be explained in terms of increasing polarity of the Trp environment as it becomes fully exposed to the solvent.",

By shifting the pH in the range pH 3 to 7.4, the \u03b1-helix is reduced with lower pH. The far-UV CD spectra revealed a clearly difference below pH 5.5, suggesting a structural transition from a \u03b2-helix structure to a slightly more \u03b2-sheet structure. It has been observed that ahelices may undergo structural transition in acidic solution and at elevated temperatures [28] .",

In the interval from 30 to 50\u00b0\u00eb, the CD spectrum of nsp14 was steady. Under further heating from 50 to 75\u00b0\u00eb, the CD spectrum underwent a change to another pattern with approximately three-fold lower the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm. These data indicated that the helical structure of nsp14 was disrupted by the thermal treatment. The result shown in Fig. 5b indicated that the Tm value of nsp14 is approximately 58\u00b0\u00eb.",
