Our results showed that depletion of cholesterol from cells or virions by treating them with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) diminished PDCoV infection in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of exogenous cholesterol to M\u03b2CD-treated cells or virions moderately restored PDCoV infectivity. Furthermore, the pharmacological sequestration of cellular or viral cholesterol efficiently blocked both virus attachment and internalization. Taken together, the current data indicate that the cholesterol present in the cell membrane and viral envelope contributes to PDCoV replication by acting as a key component in viral entry.",

It is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that taxonomically belongs to the genus Deltacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales. The virus was first discovered in pigs in Hong Kong in 2012 and subsequently, has been reported in the US, China, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam since 2014 [7, 9, 13, 14] . PDCoV infection results in severe villous atrophy in the small intestine, leading to watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and mortality in nursing piglets. The clinical and pathological presentations of PDCoV are indistinguishable from other swine enteric diseases caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), but there is apparently lower mortality in affected neonatal piglets [6] .",

ST cells were pretreated with M\u03b2CD at concentrations of 1 and 3 mM, or with DW as a vehicle control, for 1 h prior to infection. Viral production was initially measured by monitoring cytopathic effects (CPE) and was later confirmed by IFA using the anti-N protein MAb. M\u03b2CD (the cholesterol-sequestering compound) dramatically reduced virus-induced CPE and expression of the PDCoV gene in a dose-dependent manner ( Supplementary Fig. S2A ). Based on the quantification of the N protein staining results, the proportion (%) of virus-infected cells was noticeably attenuated by M\u03b2CD treatment. There was an approximate maximum of ~95% inhibition of both viruses in response to the application of 3 mM M\u03b2CD (Fig. 1A ). Treating cells with 3 mM M\u03b2CD at 0 and 1 hpi also resulted in an approximate ~85% decrease in PDCoV production, whereas exposure to the compound at 2-24 hpi had no significant inhibitory effect on infectivity compared with the control levels (Supplementary Fig. S3 ). These results demonstrate that M\u03b2CD must be present pre-infection or at an early stage of viral infection to exert its antiviral effect as a cellular cholesterol depletion reagent. We also determined viral yields during the pharmacological depletion of cellular cholesterol. As illustrated in Fig. 1B , M\u03b2CD inhibited the growth of viral progeny in a dose-dependent manner. The peak viral titer in the vehicletreated control was 10 8.45 TCID 50 /ml in the vehicle-treated control, whereas the addition of 3 mM M\u03b2CD reduced the titer of PDCoV to 10 6.45 TCID 50 /ml (representing a 2-log reduction compared with the control level). Taken together, our data indicate that depleting cholesterol from target cells efficiently suppresses PDCoV replication.",

The addition of exogenous cholesterol to M\u03b2CD-treated and virus-infected cells significantly reversed the antiviral activity of M\u03b2CD. Although incubation with M\u03b2CD alone greatly reduced PDCoV production to 59% and 29% at concentrations of 1 mM and 3 mM, respectively, supplementation with exogenous cholesterol significantly increased PDCoV production to 64% and 49%, respectively, at the same concentrations of M\u03b2CD (Fig. 1C) . Consistently, cholesterol replenishment resulted in an increase in the virus yield comparable to that of the vehicle control (Fig. 1D) . To verify the importance of cellular cholesterol, we then investigated alterations in cellular cholesterol content in cells treated with M\u03b2CD in the absence or presence of exogenous cholesterol using filipin III, which is a fluorescent polyene antibiotic that binds to cholesterol. In accordance with the lower intensity of CPE, cellular cholesterol levels specifically decreased in virus-infected M\u03b2CD-treated cells compared with those in virus-infected non-treated cells. Supplementation with exogenous cholesterol markedly elevated the cholesterol level and CPE production in virus-infected M\u03b2CD-treated cells (Fig. 1E) . Altogether, the data reveal that cellular cholesterol plays a pivotal role in PDCoV infection.",

We treated cells with M\u03b2CD and maintained them at 4 \u00b0C to permit viral binding but prevent internalization. As shown in Fig. 3A , the PDCoV titer was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the cells, indicating that cellular cholesterol depletion inhibits the attachment of the virus to the cells. Moreover, PDCoV production was diminished in M\u03b2CD-treated cells that had been incubated at 37 \u00b0C to enable virus entry to proceed, which implies that cholesterol sequestration disturbs the internalization of PDCoV. Similarly, the removal of cholesterol from the viral envelope negatively affected the viral adsorption and post-adsorption steps (Fig. 3B) . Taken together, these data demonstrate that the pharmacological sequestration of cholesterol hinders viral attachment and subsequent penetration, and the presence of cholesterol in both the cell membrane and viral envelope are indispensable for the PDCoV entry process.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our findings indicate that optimal infectivity of PDCoV requires cholesterol in the cell membrane and virus envelope, and that this is critical for the entry of PDCoV. Many coronaviruses exploit cholesterol, which is present in the viral envelope and/or the cell membrane for maximal virus entry. Only cellular cholesterol is essential for the entry of some coronaviruses including mouse hepatitis virus [2] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [8] , human coronavirus 229E [10] , avian infectious bronchitis virus [3] , type II feline coronavirus (FCoV) [16] , and PEDV [5] . However, as with PDCoV in the present study, canine coronavirus, type 1 FCoV, and TGEV [11, 12, 16] . Considering previous and present studies, the cholesterol dependence of infection differs among coronaviruses. Because the PDCoV receptor has not yet been identified, we were unable to examine whether cholesterol dependence is quantitatively related to the presence of a hitherto-unidentified receptor. Future research should address the question of whether cholesterol facilitates PDCoV entry through interactions between the viral spike protein and the cellular receptor. Nevertheless, we propose that both cellular and viral cholesterol are key players in the attachment and penetration stages of PDCoV entry. However, cholesterol depletion from the cell or virus consistently resulted in the reduction, but not the elimination, of viral infectivity. This indicates that viral entry may occur when there are low levels of cholesterol, but increased cholesterol content in both parts makes the process more efficient. Although our analysis did not elucidate the mechanism by which cholesterol promotes PDCoV entry, we assume that cholesterol-dependent viral entry is closely connected to maintaining the lipid raft structure and/or biological membrane fluidity. Impeding virus entry is a viable antiviral strategy because it likely acts on extracellular targets, thereby limiting cell damage. Therefore, PDCoV could be used as a surrogate model for testing emerging coronavirus antiviral therapies. Since no treatments or vaccines are currently available for PDCoV, the results presented here indicate that molecules that disrupt viral and/or cell cholesterol, and interfere with cholesterol function during viral entry, may provide an excellent therapeutic option for the treatment of coronavirus infection in humans and animals.
