However, the basis for Treg cytokine expression in various compartments of the periodontium remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of interleukin (IL)-35 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and periodontal tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis (CP), with a view to understanding its role in this disease, and ultimately providing improved treatments. Peripheral blood, periodontal tissues and gingival crevicular fluids (GCFs) were collected from patients with CP or impacted teeth, the latter serving as healthy controls. The expression levels of IL-35 subunit mRNAs in PBMCs and periodontal tissues were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while the IL-35 protein expression in GCFs and sera was quantified by ELISA. The relative expression of IL-35 subunit mRNAs in the affected tissues of patients with CP was significantly higher compared with that in samples from healthy controls (P<0.05). The mean concentration of IL-35 protein in the GCFs and sera of patients with periodontitis was also significantly higher compared with that in samples from healthy controls (P<0.001). IL-35 protein and periodontal clinical indicators were negatively correlated. It was hypothesized that the increased level of IL-35 plays a protective role in periodontal disease by maintaining immune system homeostasis and dampening the inflammatory response, and highlights IL-35 as a potential new therapy for the treatment of periodontitis.",

There is evidence (20, 21) to suggest that anti-inflammatory Treg cells also play an important role in the development of periodontal disease and are involved in the subsequent inflammation and bone resorption. The infiltration of Treg cells into periodontal tissue reflects their ability to inhibit tissue damage (22) . Foxp3 plays an integral role in regulating the differentiation of Treg cells (23) . In the present study, Foxp3 was detected in periodontal tissues and PBMCs using RT-qPCR and its expression was found to be significantly higher in the CP group compared with the healthy control group. IL-35 is an immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory cytokine, expressed by Foxp3 + Treg cells, that belongs to the IL-12 family of cytokines (24) . IL-35 is a dimeric protein comprised of an \u03b1 chain (p35) and a \u03b2 chain (EBi3) (14) . Unlike other cytokines of the IL-12 family, IL-35 acts as an inhibitory factor for chronic inflammation, autoimmune disease and other immune disorders (7) , and the expression of IL-35 in Treg cells is associated with their immune inhibitory ability (25) . It has also been suggested that IL-35, as an inhibitory cytokine, plays a central role in infection and immune regulation (26) , which includes inhibiting the proliferation of T cells and their effects. In the present study, it was observed that IL-35 was strongly detected in periodontitis tissues and the expression of IL-35 protein was increased in tissues from the CP group compared with those of healthy controls.",

These data suggest that IL-35 in autoimmune or infectious diseases may regulate the local microenvironment and peripheral immune response, maintaining its homeostasis. The analysis of IL-12p35 and EBi3 (IL-35) mRNAs using RT-qPCR in PBMCs and periodontal tissues from patients with CP in the present study revealed significantly higher expression in the CP group compared with the healthy control group. This is a similar result to that of Kalburgi et al, which to the best of our knowledge is the only other study to address the role of IL-35 in periodontal disease, albeit using semi-quantitative RT-PCR (32) . The present study also found that the mean concentration of IL-35 protein in GCFs and sera from the CP group was significantly higher than for the healthy group, paralleling gene expression. These results suggest that IL-35 is an essential factor for the immune response of Treg cells, and may be useful in the prognosis of CP. Similarly, Nakajima et al (33) reported that the proportion of CD4 + CD25 + T cells and Foxp3 expression in periodontal disease tissues was increased compared with those of gingivitis controls. Since EBi3 is a downstream target of Foxp3 (7), the high expression of Foxp3 mRNA, as detected in the present study, would promote EBi3 subunit formation and therefore explain the high IL-35 protein expression that was observed.",

In addition, although patients included in the study did not exhibit systemic disease, periodontitis may cause, or aggravate, chronic inflammation in systemic disease. More specifically, gram-negative anaerobic bacteria at the bottom of periodontal pockets may invade epithelial cells and hide in host cells, aggravating the destruction of periodontal tissue; they can potentially also invade endothelial cells and access the blood circulation to stimulate a host immune response and cause systemic inflammation (34) (35) (36) . IL-35, as a negative regulator of immune factors, may slow or inhibit the development of periodontal disease and thus, indirectly, also slow systemic disease. IL-35 is a relatively recently identified cytokine that has not been studied in many disease models. Since the parameters investigated in the present study are few, it is unclear whether IL-35 enhances or antagonizes the effects of other cytokines or immune cells in CP. In future, it will be necessary to increase sample sizes and study a greater number of parameters to more fully understand the role of IL-35 in CP.",
