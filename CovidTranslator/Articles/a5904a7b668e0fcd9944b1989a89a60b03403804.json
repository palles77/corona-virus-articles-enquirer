The oldest known epidemic is thought to be the Paris outbreak of 1578. In this Historical Review, we describe three epidemics of whooping cough in Persia, which although arising roughly one century before the Paris outbreak, have not been examined in detail. A great amount of epidemiological detail was reported that not only distinguishes the various stages and complications of whooping cough, but also reveals unique immunological aspects of this disease. The fi rst of these epidemics is the oldest recorded whooping cough epidemic. On the basis of epidemiological features, we propose that this whooping cough epidemic was the fi rst to have taken place in Persia and might have been part of the fi rst pandemic. This theory pushes back the date of fi rst documented emergence of whooping cough by almost a century, which matches molecular data about its spread. Here, we discuss features of these early epidemics in relation to their initial emergence, potential origins, and spread to Europe.",

Although some of these agents (such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) have not led to endemicity, others (such as HIV) have joined the pantheon of microbes that continue to affl ict us. Whooping cough-induced mainly by Bordetella pertussis-is a relatively recent addition to this ever-growing list of diseases. However, before the advent of vaccination, generations of physicians recognised whooping cough as a childhood disease with potentially deadly complications. In the vaccine era, this disease continues to be endemic and has shown a resurgence since the 1980s. [1] [2] [3] Increased understanding of the origins of whooping cough and the factors that led to its rapid spread and persistence in human beings could lead to improved therapeutics or vaccines, or even insight in other diverse disciplines such as ecology, history, or anthropology.",

            "text": "The second phase, the paroxysmal phase, is characterised by so-called whoops. These whoops are short expiratory bursts of dry, non-productive cough followed by long inspiratory gasps, making the character istic whooping sound. As many as 50 paroxysms can happen in a day, which can end with an episode of vomiting or be associated with cyanosis. 7 Attack rates of 50-100% have been noted in susceptible populations, 8 and complications include pneumonia, haemorrhage, and death. In the prevaccination era (prior to the 1950s), mortality rates of up to 6% were reported in endemic areas with susceptible populations. 4 Before the advent of the pertussis vaccine, epidemics happened in 3-5 (and up to 7) year cycles coincident with the presence of susceptible people (eg, children) in the population. 9,10 The third and fi nal phase of whooping cough is the convalescent phase, which consists of a chronic dry cough lasting 2-3 months that slowly abates. 9, 10 Diseases with the classic symptoms of the paroxysmal phase of whooping cough are absent in reports from Greek and Roman physicians, and from those of the later Persian physicians such as Rhazes and Avicenna. 4, 11, 12 Likewise, whooping cough does not seem to have been present in the Americas until after its appearance in Europe. Results from molecular studies have confi rmed that although B pertussis is more than several million years old, it rapidly expanded within the human population in the past 500 years. 13 Guillaume de Baillou (also known as Ballonius; 1538-1616) provided what is considered to be the earliest European description of the paroxysmal phase of whooping cough. He described the earliest account of epidemic spread of the illness in Paris in 1578. 14 He described an autumn and then a summer epidemic. The description of the summer epidemic is especially detailed and described a new disease that was termed \"quinta\". This disease is clearly recognisable as whooping cough to modern clinicians. Children aged 4-10 years were mainly aff ected, with a violent dry cough that ended in vomiting (or cyanosis) with a high mortality. Ballonius states: \"The lung is so irritated that in the eff ort it makes to get rid of that which aff ects it, it can inhale and exhale only with Historical Review diffi culty\u2026The patient swells up and nearly suff ocated, feels as though his breath was stopped in the middle of his throat\u2026Some believe that this name [quinta] was made-up because of the sound of the patient in coughing. The torment of the cough is sometimes suspended for 4-5 hours after which the paroxysm returns, which is often so violent that it causes blood to issue from the nose and mouth and very frequently\u2026causes vomiting\". 11 Several earlier epidemics, some of which shared features of whooping cough, had also been reported, but were not thought to be this same disease. These include the 1540 epidemic in England, and a 1414 epidemic in Paris that caused coryza, hoarseness, and death (especially in elderly people). The 1414 Paris epidemic has been rejected as whooping cough by several scholars because of a missing mention of cough, absence of infant mortality, and the short-lived span of the epidemic (a maximum of 2 months) that seems more akin to infl uenza. 11, 12, 15 A cough similar to whooping cough was also mentioned in a Korean medical and pharmaceutical textbook from 1433. 16 However, we are not aware of description of any other associated symptoms or an epidemic disposition of this disease that would be consistent with whooping cough rather than croup. Although Bah\u0101' al-Dawlah R\u0101z\u012b is credited with having described whooping cough in 16th century Persia, 17 his writing on the subject has not been examined in detail. Here, we describe three epidemics in 15th and 16th century Persia, the fi rst of which is probably the fi rst epidemic of whooping cough in Persia, and the earliest recorded whooping cough epidemic in the world, which at the time was probably becoming pandemic.",

First, the disease aff ected many people (children and adults), signifying that it was an epidemic that was not present before. There was spread through households, implying a high attack rate characteristic of whooping cough. The disease caused widespread death, as whooping cough is known to do, especially when aff ecting regions where the population had no previous immunity. In terms of symptoms, the disease caused the classic chronic nonproductive cough. This cough was reported to end with vomiting or fainting, which are well known complications of the paroxysmal phase. Finally, the cough was noted to last for up to 2 months, essentially describing the convalescent phase of the disease.",

On the basis of the timeline shown in fi gure 2, the Rey epidemic happened after the Herat epidemic. The following is Bah\u0101' al-Dawlah's description of the Rey epidemic: \"In late winter of 906 HG [1501 CE] in Rey, the air caused cough in infants and children, and it was so intense that the coughs did not diminish until vomiting appeared and weakness developed, and such a pain was in their chests that the small children placed their hands over their chests and moaned...and some neared death\u2026and some became better with this treatment\u2026and some were cured of this chronic illness. And some, by the weakness caused by the cough, developed a fever\u2026and the heat of the fever caused an improvement, and it would remit causing a crisis with sweating, leading to a cessation of the cough and fever\". 22 The Rey epidemic shares many of the features of the Herat epidemic. First, a disease is mentioned causing a chronic cough. Additionally, the cough is so violent that it does not diminish until vomiting or weakness develops. That the Persian words the author uses in this sentence for both the Rey and Herat epidemics are almost identical is noteworthy. However, we will examine some notable diff erences in reference to both mortality and age cohort of those people aff ected. The little emphasis on death in the Rey epidemic could call into question whether the epidemic truly represents whooping cough. But this should be considered in the context of an established endemic infection and a background of low life expectancy. An important feature of the Herat epidemics is that both adults and children were aff ected. This point suggests that previous immunity was not present in adults, and that the disease was not yet endemic. Findings made in the prevaccination era, show that in regions where pertussis is endemic, it causes typical disease in people who are not immune, usually children (adults have prolonged immunity from initial infection and then immune boosting from constant exposure). 6, 23, 24 Adults who became infected in the vaccination and prevaccination era represent cases of re-infection after natural infection or vaccination and not fi rst episodes of infection. 6 However, at one time, a population of susceptible (naive) adults must have become infected. We believe that the Herat epidemic probably represents the fi rst such epidemic in Persia and probably denotes a time when this disease was becoming pandemic. The Paris epidemic might have likewise been the fi rst in its region, because in the spring epidemic, a disease aff ecting mostly infants is not mentioned (implying that both adults and infants were infected). However, in the summer epidemic, infants were most aff ected by the disease. Most of the infants from Paris aff ected in the summer were probably those born in the spring, whose immunity by maternal transfer of antibody was waning.",

The author does not specify what time of year the fi rst epidemic took place, but his writing implies that both epidemics were temporally associated, and that the second epidemic was in the spring. This association is reminiscent of what Ballonius would later describe in Paris (ie, a spring and then a summer epidemic). The descriptions of the Parisian and Persian epidemics, in that they spanned many diff erent seasons, are compatible with our knowledge about whooping cough in the prevaccination era (ie, that the disease could be present in any season). 6 Based on the assumption that the two epidemics that Ballonius described were both due to whooping cough, the short interval of weeks or months before the second epidemic happened might be a feature of an emerging whooping cough infection that infects a susceptible population.",

Rey and Herat were both important and large cities on the Silk Road, a trade route that spanned thousands of kilometres. Although the international component of the Silk Road was in decline by the 14th century during the Timurid dynasty, both Rey and Herat were major cities in Persia and would have had substantial and ongoing contacts between them. The distance between Rey and Herat is about 1000 km. Therefore, that the initial epidemics took place contemporaneously or within a year or two of each other is not inconceivable. Furthermore, as shown in studies from the prevaccination era in the USA, the rural penetration of whooping cough was extremely high, much more so than that of other diseases such as mumps, measles, rubella, scarlet fever, meningitis, and diphtheria. 9 By the time of the 1501 Rey epidemic, whooping cough had become endemic in Persia, as corroborated by accounts of the disease similar to the Herat epidemic being described in children and not adults. Furthermore, unlike the Herat epidemic, mortality was not emphasised. We attribute this to a lower overall mortality or a mortality on par with other endemic diseases of the time. In the time between the Herat and Rey epidemics, up to four other whooping cough epidemics could have happened in Persia (depending on the exact year that the Herat epidemic took place and assuming a 3-7 year cycle for an epidemic), with most surviving adults being immune. Another 77 years would pass before whooping cough would be fi rst described in Paris.",
