However, safety concerns remain a major problem regarding the use of even highly attenuated viral vectors. Using the rabies virus (RV) envelope protein as a carrier molecule, we show here that inactivated RV particles can be utilized to present Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA) domain-4 in the viral membrane. In addition to the RV glycoprotein (G) transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, a portion of the RV G ectodomain was required to express the chimeric RV G anthrax PA on the cell surface. The novel antigen was also efficiently incorporated into RV virions. Mice immunized with the inactivated recombinant RV virions exhibited seroconversion against both RV G and anthrax PA, and a second inoculation greatly increased these responses. These data demonstrate that a viral envelope protein can carry a bacterial protein and that a viral carrier can display whole polypeptides compared to the limited epitope presentation of previous viral systems.",

Existing prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for combating anthrax are insufficient.",

            "text": "The most lethal form of the disease, inhalation anthrax, presents with general, flu-like symptoms, so that early diagnosis is difficult. Prompt recognition of symptoms is required for effective therapeutic treatment using antibiotics or passive immunization following unknown exposure (Sternbach, 2003) . While passive immunization is effective (Sawada-Hirai et al., 2004) , the availability of immune sera is highly limited and no approved therapeutic antibodies against anthrax are currently available. Several antibiotics care effective against B. anthracis, but, antimicrobial resistance engineered into future bioterrorism-grade anthrax can be envisioned. Moreover, antibiotics can eliminate the bacteria but not the toxins that may already have been released. Thus, vaccination is a highly practical alternative to post-exposure treatment and eliminates the risk of infection. Virology 353 (2006) 344 -356 www.elsevier.com/locate/yviro Anthrax disease is caused by the toxins. The anthrax toxins act as a tripartite system in which transport of the active components, lethal and edema factors into the cell, is facilitated by the binding component, protective antigen (PA) . PA binds to receptors on the cell surface and is cleaved by cellular furin (Molloy et al., 1992 ) into a small subunit and the larger 63-kDa constituent, PA63. Seven receptor-bound PA63 units oligomerize to form a complex that binds with lethal factor and edema factor and that passes into the cytoplasm. Two receptors, ATR/TEM8 (Bradley et al., 2001) and CMG2 (Scobie et al., 2003) , bind PA and mediate toxicity. PA is comprised of four distinct domains, with receptor interactions occurring at sites within PA domain-4 (D4) and -2. The structure of the receptor binding ridge is highly conserved, suggesting that ATR/TEM8 and CMG2 interact with PA in the same manner (Santelli et al., 2004) . Passive and active immunization indicates that protection is mediated by humoral immune responses (Enserink, 2002; Pitt et al., 2001; Welkos et al., 2001) and binding of PA to the cell surface receptors can be prevented by anti-PA antibodies. Of note, antibodies elicited by PA immunization can confer protection against B. anthracis challenge (Beedham et al., 2001; Ivins et al., 1992 Ivins et al., , 1998 Kobiler et al., 2002; Little et al., 1997) , and antibodies against epitopes within PA D4 also show protective capacity (Flick-Smith et al., 2002b; Kasuya et al., 2005; Maynard et al., 2002) .",

Methods for engineering the virus are well established, up to two foreign genes totaling 6.5 kb have been incorporated thus far, and foreign sequences are stably maintained. RV grows to high titers in cell lines approved for human vaccine production and manufacture is economical. Our current RV vaccine vector is based on the vaccine strain SAD-B19 used since 1983 as a live oral immunogen to vaccinate wild life in Europe and Asia (Schneider et al., 1988) .

Therefore, anthrax PA63, optimized for human codon usage to ensure high expression levels, was cloned into the RV vaccine vector pSPBN resulting in pSPBN-PA63 (Fig. 1) . Recombinant RV was recovered by standard methods and expression of PA63 was confirmed by immunostaining with anti-PA monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2 , panel B\u2032). To analyze the immunogenicity of the recombinant RV SPBN-PA63, five BALB/c mice were inoculated i.m. with 10 6 ffu and sera from immunized mice were analyzed by a PA-specific ELISA 14 days after immunization. However, no PA-specific antibodies were detected in any of the immunized animals (data not shown). To determine whether surface expression of anthrax PA might increase its immunogenicity in the vaccinated host, we used the RV G ER translocation SS in addition to the RV G TM and CD (Fig. 1) . The gene encoding the chimeric RV G-anthrax PA was introduced into the RV vector pSPBN, resulting in pSPBN-PA63-TC. BSR cells were infected with SPBN ( Fig. 2, antibody directed against PA ( Fig. 2 panels A\u2032\u2032, B\u2032\u2032, C\u2032\u2032) or permeabilized with Triton X-100 for internal staining with an antibody against anthrax PA ( Fig. 2 panels A\u2032, B\u2032, C\u2032) or RV N protein ( Fig. 2 panels A , B, C). All cells were infected with RV as indicated by a bright signal with an RV N-specific antibody. Moreover, anti-PA monoclonal antibody detected the internal expression of PA63 in both SPBN-PA63-or SPBN-PA63-TCinfected cells. However, no expression of PA63 on the cell surface was detected for either of the viruses expressing PA63 independent of the use of the RV G signal sequence.",

            "text": "To test the hypothesis that a lack of transport through the ER and Golgi apparatus accounted for the lack of surface expression, and that a portion of the RV G might support such transport, we utilized different portions of the RV G ED in addition to the TM and CD of RV G. We constructed five different plasmids containing increasing portions of the RV G ED in addition to anthrax PA. Based on previous research indicating that D4 of anthrax PA is the most potent antigen to induce protective antibodies, we used this 140-aa fragment comprising the carboxy-terminal region of PA. Use of this fragment allowed us to examine whether D4 flanked by the RV G SS, TM and CD fails to be transported to the cell surface as observed for PA63. The genes encoding RV Ganthrax PA D4 fusion proteins containing 0, 51, 127, 210, or 439 amino acids of the RV ED were PCR-amplified and introduced into an expression plasmid under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promotor (Fig. 3) . The resulting plasmids were designated pD4-\u0394ED, pD4-E51, pD4-E127, pD4-E210, and pD4-E439. To evaluate the cell surface expression of the recombinant RV G-D4 fusion proteins, BSR cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase for one h, transfected with 5 \u03bcg of each of the five plasmids and 24 h later fixed in paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and immunostained with anti-PA monoclonal antibody. A second set of transfected cells was treated similarly but was not permeabilized. As shown in Fig. 4A , all proteins were successfully expressed (internal staining) in transfected cells, whereas significant surface expression was detected only for recombinant protein D4-E51 (surface staining). More quantitative analysis by FACS (Fig. 4B ) confirmed that only D4-E51 was expressed at high levels on the cell surface, while surface expression for pD4-pD4-E127 and pD4-E439 was detectable but at lower levels than observed for pD4-E51. Western blotting analysis of transfected cell lysates using antibodies directed against anthrax PA or RV G CD ( Fig. 4C ) revealed chimeric RV G-D4 proteins of the expected sizes of 21 kDa, 29 kDa, 37 kDa, or 74 kDa for D4-\u0394ED, D4-E51, D4-E127, and pD4-E439 with both the PA-and the RV G CD-specific antibodies. Interestingly, the RV G CD-directed antibody failed to detect the D4-E210 fusion protein suggesting cleavage or degradation of the carboxy-terminus of this protein. The antibody directed against the amino-terminal-located D4 of D4-E210 detected the protein but at a smaller than predicted size, further indicating degradation. All recombinant fusion proteins showed a diffuse migration pattern over a range of up to 20 kDa. Sequence analysis of PA indicates several potential N-and O-glycosylation sites within D4, which might contribute to the observed retarded migration. Fig. 3 . Construction of plasmids containing D4 fused to various RV G ED fragments. Panel A shows RV G protein is shown in panel A. The three potential sites of Nlinked glycosylation are indicated. To construct chimeric RV G/anthrax PA fusion proteins, the RV G ED was replaced with domain 4 of PA (D4-\u0394ED, B). The membrane-proximal 51, 127 or 210 amino acids of the RV G ectodomain containing one, two or three potential N-linked glycosylation sites, respectively, were reintroduced into D4-\u0394ED to generate D4-E51, D4-127 and D4-210, respectively (C, D, E). The full-length RV G ectodomain was inserted into D4-\u0394ED resulting in D4-E439 (F).",

All mice immunized with killed SPBN-D4-E51 in a range of 50 \u03bcg to 50 ng showed strong responses to RV G and anthrax PA.

A second inoculation with the same vaccine used for priming significantly increased the PA and RV G responses. In addition, antibodies levels in sera of mice immunized twice with recombinant PA and RV G were comparable to those in sera of mice immunized twice with 50 ng SPBN-D4-51. A separate experiment (experiment B in Table 1 ) using the same antigens and schedule but with 5-fold increased amounts of recombinant anthrax PA and RV G showed similar results with the exception that the increased amount of RV G protein induced higher antigen-specific seroconversion. However, priming with 500 ng PA still resulted in low PA-specific titers after priming. ",

Consistent with these observations, our initial construct, PA-TC, as well as the D4-\u0394ED lacking any of the RV G ectodomain, were not transported to the cell surface. Additionally, it has been shown that glycosylation of at least one site on the RV G ectodomain is required for trimer formation and for cellsurface expression of wild-type RV G (Shakin-Eshleman et al., 1992) . For VSV G, only the 12 membrane proximal amino acids of the ED are required for trimer formation, cell surface expression and subsequent virus incorporation (Robison and Whitt, 2000) . However, this cannot explain why RV G chimera D4-E51 was successfully trafficked to the cell surface because this region of the RV G ED does not contain potential glycosylation sites. However, trimerization of the D4-E51 molecules or between wild type RV G and D4-E51 might also be required for transport, a possibility that awaits biochemical analyses. While we were succeeded in expressing a chimeric RV G/anthrax PA fusion protein on the cell surface, a concern remains regarding transport of the chimeric glycoproteins depending on the size of the foreign polypeptide. However, our preliminary results using the entire PA63 (428 aa) as well as heavy-chain 50 of botulinum neurotoxin A (436 aa) fused to the E51 construct indicate excellent cell surface expression (Koser and Schnell, unpublished) . Together, our results show that RV G is permissive for the fusion of large foreign protein fragments, that virus particles can incorporate such a chimeric glycoprotein, and that such RV-based vectors are replication-competent.",

The lack of a humoral response to our initial vaccine expressing PA63 by live RV is not entirely surprising since the protein is produced intracellularly and availability to stimulate B cells is therefore probably low. We previously reported that the nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV was not immunogenic in mice when expressed by a similar RV vaccine vector, but high titers of neutralizing antibodies were detected when the SARS-CoV spike protein was expressed by RV (Faber et al., 2005) . Even though the reason for this might lie in the different immunogenicity of the two SARS-CoV proteins, it appears that proteins expressed on the cell surface and incorporated into RV virions are more potent inducers of humoral responses than are internally expressed proteins. This motion is supported by the finding that a single immunization with RV induces strong humoral responses against RV G but only modest responses against the internal RV proteins .",

Note that several other approaches to anthrax vaccination require multiple doses for induction of antibody responses (Aulinger et al., 2005; Galen et al., 2004; Rhie et al., 2003) . This is consistent with our expectation that SPBN-D4-E51 particles maximally stimulate B cells. RV G in wild type virus comprises 24% of the virus mass (Flamand et al., 1993; Wunner, 1991) . The chimeric glycoprotein D4-E51 was incorporated, at best, equivalently to RV G. Thus, attributing 12% of the virus particle mass to the D4-E51 glycoprotein, a dose of 7.5 \u03bcg of SPBN-D4-E51 contains an antigen dose equivalent to 500 ng of rPA. We speculate that this 150-fold decrease in SPBN-D4-E51 dose requirement is due to presentation by the virus particle, consistent with studies comparing the immunogenicity of proteins presented in a soluble form disordered form versus proteins complexed to viruses or virus-like particles (Eckhart et al., 1996; Fehr et al., 1997 Fehr et al., , 1998 .",

For anthrax, immunization with PA at antibody-sub-stimulating levels primes for a more robust and rapid humoral response upon boost as compared to without prime (Marcus et al., 2004) . As expected, boosting with a second dose of live or killed SPBN-D4-E51 resulted in an increase in anti-PA and anti-RV G titers. High antibody titers also resulted following boost with rPA, but there was a clear difference in the IgG subclass. Antibodies to PA, either induced by vaccination or passively administered, confer protection against challenge (Beedham et al., 2001; Ivins et al., 1998) , so that stimulation of a Th2 type response is desirable. Analogous to the case with AVA (Semenova et al., 2004) and with rPA formulated in aluminum hydroxide (Tan et al., 2003) the subclass distribution of sera from mice immunized with 50 ng or more of SPBN-D4-E51 was primarily IgG1 indicating a Th2-biased response. By contrast, the 5 ng dose of SPBN-D4-E51 as well as rPA stimulated Th1-associated antibodies consistent with the notion that IgG subclass response is dependent upon dose and context of antigen presentation.",
