Currently available methods allow bulk analysis of vesicles but are not suited for accurate quantification and fail to reveal phenotypic heterogeneity in membrane vesicle populations. For such analyses, single vesicle-based, multiparameter, high-throughput methods are needed. We developed a fluorescence-based, high-resolution flow cytometric method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of nanosized membrane vesicles. Proof of principle was obtained by single-particle analysis of virions and liposomes. Further validation was obtained by quantification of cell-derived nanosized membrane vesicles from cell cultures and body fluids. An important aspect was that the technology was extended to detect specific proteins on individual vesicles. This allowed identification of exosome subsets and phenotyping of individual exosomes produced by dendritic cells (DCs) undergoing different modes of activation. The described technology allows quantitative, multiparameter, and high-throughput analysis of a wide variety of nanosized particles and has broad applications.",

[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Cell-derived membrane vesicles are either shed from the plasma membrane (microparticles/microvesicles, 50-1000 nm) or exocytosed by fusion of multivesicular endosomes with the plasma membrane (exosomes, 50-100 nm). 1, 2 The heterogeneity of cell-derived membrane vesicles in body fluids reflects the plethora of cellular origins. The abundance of a specific vesicle type may reflect the health or disease status of the tissue of origin, making these vesicles good candidates for biomarkers for noninvasive detection and monitoring of several diseases. 7, 11, 15, 16 Furthermore, exosomes derived from dendritic cells (DCs) or tumor cells have been applied as \"cell-free vaccines\" in experimental tumor models and clinical trials in cancer patients. 8, 17 Conversely, application of tumor exosomes can also result in accelerated tumor growth. 18 Both for the development of the biomarker field and for the safe clinical application of membrane vesicles, highresolution analysis methods are needed for vesicle characterization and/or quality control. Proteomics, western-blotting, and lipidomics have been applied to characterize bulk isolates of membrane vesicles. However, a standardized, multiparameter, high-throughput method is required to analyze individual membrane vesicles and heterogeneity in membrane-vesicle populations. Microscopic analysis revealed that the vast majority of membrane vesicles present in cell culture supernatants or body fluids are significantly smaller than 300 nm. 3, 19, 20 Although vesicles as small as 50-100 nm can be accurately visualized and characterized using specific imaging techniques, [19] [20] [21] [22] these techniques preclude analysis of the large numbers of vesicles needed to study their quantity and heterogeneity. 3, 19 Flow cytometry on the other hand is an ideal technique to simultaneously quantify and qualify high numbers of cells and vesicles with a diameter N 300 nm. [23] [24] [25] However, this method falls short for the analysis of smaller membrane vesicles (b 300 nm). 26, 27 We here describe a novel high-resolution flow cytometry-based method for fluorescence-based detection of single nanosized particles that can be used for both standardized quantification and multiparameter characterization.",

For cells and particles larger than 500 nm the amount of light scattered at small angles (0.5-15 degrees), i.e., forward scatter (FSC), is commonly used as a rough indication of their size. 26 However, particles with sizes near and below the wavelength of light (NPs) scatter proportionally more light at larger angles (15-150 degrees). 26, 27, 33 We have used a flow cytometer equipped with a photomultiplier tube detecting forward scattered light at 2-25 degrees (wide-angle forward scatter detection). We further increased the sensitivity for small particle detection by increasing the minimum detection angle to 14 degrees, resulting in an increased signal-to-noise ratio. 27 In addition, we used fluorescence threshold triggering to discriminate fluorescently labeled particles of interest from noise signals (Supplementary Figure S1 A-D) . With this set-up, 100and 200-nm fluorescent beads could be selectively detected above the fluorescence threshold, and we achieved an unprecedented clear wide-angle FSC-based separation of these bead populations (Supplementary Figure S1 C-D) . Light scattered at 90 degrees (side scatter, SSC) has also been used for analysis of small particles. 34 However, SSC and backward scatter are more sensitive to changes in the geometry and internal structures of small particles. 33 More important, we observed that the resolving power (change in light scatter with particle size) of the wide-angle FSC was greater than that of the SSC (Supplementary Figure S1 E) . Based on these findings, we selected wide-angle FSC for relative sizing of nanosized particles.",

The ratio of detected 100-versus 200-nm beads correlated linearly with the dilution factor (R 2 = 0.999) with the predicted slope (Figure 1, A) , demonstrating that nanosized particles could be accurately quantified at a large range of concentrations. A disadvantage of using reference beads is that they can stick to the biological NPs of interest. Therefore, as an alternative we used a fixed timeframe for quantification (Figure 1,  B ). An important finding was that the absolute number of measured 100-nm beads deviated b 10% from the specified number of input beads over a large range of concentrations (Figure 1, B) , confirming that the complete population of beads was detected above the fluorescence threshold and that noise signals were eliminated.

In comparison with 100-nm beads and the virions, the liposomes displayed a relatively low wide-angle FSC value (Figure 2, F) . This finding is most likely due to the low refractive index of these liposome preparations, indicating that particle composition also influences wide-angle FSC levels. Although the light scattering values cannot be used for absolute sizing, we conclude that wide-angle FSC can be used for approximate sizing, as well as for relative sizing of nanosized membrane particles and vesicles with a comparable composition.",

MHCII is incorporated into DC exosomes 30, 37 but is absent on mouse T cells and T cell-derived exosomes. MHCII stained vesicles were detected in those sucrose fractions containing DC exosomes ( Figure 5, B) , with signals well above isotype control antibody staining ( Figure 5, B, C) . The MHCII staining levels of DC exosomes were variable. Vesicles floating at a relative high density (1.18 g/mL) contained the highest amount of MHCII ( Figure 5, B) . Besides MHCIIpositive exosomes, MHCII-negative vesicles also were observed ( Figure 5, C) . This suggests that DC can also secrete vesicles that contain little or no MHCII. Exosomes derived from murine T cells were all negative for MHCII ( Figure 5, C) . In DC-T cell co-culture supernatants, both MHCII-positive and MHCIInegative populations of exosomes were found ( Figure 5 , C).

For the larger membrane vesicles in human blood (N 300 nm), FSC-based flow cytometric analysis appeared to be a reproducible method for highthroughput, multiparameter analysis at the particle level. 23-25 , 39 However, the majority of secreted membrane vesicles in body fluids are in the nanoscale size range (50-100 nm), 19 which cannot be visualized by conventional FSC-based analysis. [23] [24] [25] Techniques that allow phenotypic analysis of individual nanosized membrane vesicles, including immunoelectron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, preclude analysis of large numbers of vesicles needed to study their quantity and heterogeneity. 3, 19 Recently, NTA has been described as a method to analyze cell-derived membrane vesicles. 21 Although NTA is a powerful method for size analysis, quantitative measurements are less precise in samples containing differently sized vesicles 21 and the number of parameters that can be analyzed simultaneously is limited. These limitations pose a disadvantage for the analysis of biological fluids containing many different types of cellular membrane vesicles. We here described a novel flow cytometry-based method allowing simultaneous high-throughput quantitative analysis and multiple-parameter phenotyping of individual nanosized membrane vesicles. This methodology proved suitable for the accurate and absolute quantification of nanosized particles over a wide range of concentrations, setting the stage for its applicability in biomarker analysis.

Second, the BD Influx is fitted with a high-performance photomultiplier tube instead of a photodiode (used in other flow cytometers) for detection of FSC signals. Third, we used fluorescence threshold triggering, which was crucial to distinguish nanosized fluorescently labeled particles of interest from noise signals with overlapping light scattering properties.

There are two important advantages of using a labeling method for indiscriminative detection of the entire membrane vesicle population above the fluorescence threshold. First, particles of interest can be accurately quantified because all noise signals are eliminated. Second, by combining the general fluorescent labeling with labeling for a specific marker, vesicle subsets can be identified and related to the entire membrane vesicle population. To analyze fluorescently labeled membrane vesicles, removal of unbound soluble and aggregated dye is very important. Simple washing by sedimentation through ultracentrifugation was not efficient to remove dye aggregates, which appeared above the fluorescence threshold with scatter levels just below those of 100-nm beads. Density gradient ultracentrifugation was therefore crucial to separate the vesicles from unbound dye and simultaneously allowed the identification of membrane vesicles subsets with distinct buoyant densities.",
