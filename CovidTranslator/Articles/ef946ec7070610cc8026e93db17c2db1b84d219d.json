After some general observations about CARV infections, this article focuses on this important recent literature and specifically on the four most common pathogens, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV), and adenovirus. It concludes by briefly touching on several less commonly reported causes of viral pneumonia, including some potentially important emerging pathogens.",

This differences in part result from the nature of the diseases, because both their seasonality and relative frequencies may vary depending on the climate of the reporting institutions. Similarly, studies that track only a single year's incidence of the CARVs may over-or underestimate the general relative frequency of the pathogens based on a particularly widespread epidemic of a single viral pathogen, as might be seen in a year with an especially widespread influenza epidemic. Table 1 reviews the relative frequencies of the CARVs in several recent reports. Depending on the center and the year, RSV, PIV, or influenza has been the most common pathogen, whereas adenovirus generally accounts for fewer than 10% of CARV infections [1 -8] . Finally, studies that include children may report higher rates of CARV infections than those focusing on adult populations, probably reflecting in part the higher carriage of CARVs in children.",

            "text": "Most commonly, investigators have employed two major strategies to gain an understanding of the general epidemiology of respiratory virus infections. In the first, consecutive tranplant recipients have been screened at regular intervals, usually in the first 6 to 18 months after transplantation, regardless of symptomatology. Results of such studies have shown overall incidence rates of CARV infection in HSCT recipients ranging from 11% to 65% [5 -7,9] . In contrast, a recent prospective surveillance study in SOT recipients showed only a 4% incidence of CARV in adult liver transplant recipients during the first 12 weeks after transplantation, although interpretation of this study is limited by the investigators' use of throat swabs alone to detect CARV infection [10] . More frequently published are large retrospective case series of CARV infections. Because these series do not include patients who had asymptomatic infection, overall reported rates of CARV infection are predictably lower, ranging from 4% to 27% in HSCT recipients [1 -3,11 ] to 8% to 21% in lung transplant recipients [8, 12, 13] . Although these larger reported series represent the best estimates of the CARV disease burden in the general transplant population, it is important to remember that the reports are biased by the seasonal occurrence of CARV in both nosocomial and community settings and the potentially devastating impact of these infections on HSCT and SOT patients [14] .",

            "text": "A major limiting factor in the understanding of CARV infection has been the limited sensitivity of what currently are the most widely used diagnostic tests. In three patient series involving more than 1500 episodes of symptomatic URI in HSCT recipients [2, 4, 11] , fewer than half the patients had a virus isolated from clinical specimens. Most studies (and clinical centers) use a combination of direct (DFA) or indirect (IFA) fluorescent antibody testing and viral culture. Results of fluorescent antibody testing are typically available in about 24 hours, but viral culture may not be positive for 7 to 14 days. In children, these tests are often performed on samples from nasopharyngeal lavage. In adults, swabs from the nasopharynx or throat often are substituted. Whereas the DFA or IFA tests may have a sensitivity of up to 90% for CARV infection in immunocompetent hosts, two studies comparing IFA and viral culture in HSCT recipients have shown a composite IFA sensitivity of 52% [2 -4,11,15] . Palmer and colleagues [16] reported a DFA sensitivity of 20% in their series of lung tranplant recipients who had CARV infections. Both fluorescent antibody testing and viral culture probably have higher yields when the sample is obtained from the lower respiratory tract. In one recent study, two thirds of CARV diagnoses were made from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples [17] . Recently, two series have used real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to test for CARV infections in HSCT recipients [9, 15] . In one series of 72 adult HSCT recipients being monitored with routine nasal and throat swabs over a 6-month period, real-time PCR was positive in 33 patients, whereas viral culture was positive in only 11 [9] . Many of the additional positive tests were asymptomatic patients who had rhinovirus infection. Bredius and colleagues [15] tested 39 children with symptomatic respiratory tract infection; IFA was positive in 5; viral culture was positive in 10; and real-time PCR was positive in 13.",

This link is supported by a mouse model in which PIV infection aggravated chronic rejection of lung allografts [13] . Epidemiologically, the possibility that CARV infection contributes to chronic lung transplant rejection manifesting as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) has been supported by the observation that BOS may have a seasonal pattern of onset [17] . This observation has not been true in all studies, however [13] . Although BOS occurs in up to 60% to 80% of lung transplant recipients after 5 years [21] , the overall incidence rates for each of the four most commonly reported CARVs generally have not exceeded 5% in lung transplant cohorts [8,13, 21 -23] . As noted previously, this percentage may reflect a limitation in current diagnostics rather than a lower incidence of these infections.",

Khalifah and colleagues [8] followed 259 adult lung transplant recipients prospectively and identified 21 CARV infections. Nearly all were lower respiratory infections found on bronchoscopy performed either for surveillance or in response to a new clinical syndrome. Patients who had any history of CARV infection in this cohort were more likely to develop severe BOS (38% versus 14%), to die from BOS (29% versus 9%), or to die from any cause (43% versus 23%) than were patients who had no history of CARV infection [8] . Additionally, the authors note that of eight patients who had RSV infection, three who were treated with antiviral agents did not develop BOS, whereas four of five patients not treated with antiviral agents did develop BOX. Billings and colleagues [13] followed 219 adult lung transplant recipients and found 40 CARV infections in 33 patients over an 11-year follow-up period. Again, the majority of identified CARV infections in this series were LRTI, and many were identified from bronchoscopy specimens when bronchoscopy was performed for surveillance or follow-up of treatment for rejection. In this series, CARV LRTI was found to be predictive of severe (grade 3) BOS, but not of moderate (grade 2) BOS. The authors noted that BOS was clearly a risk factor for CARV [13] . It is possible that the chronic rejection facilitates colonization, infection, or progression to LRTI by CARVs. It is also probable; however, that patients who have BOS undergo more frequent bronchoscopy, making it more likely that CARV infection will be identified. Taken together, the reports from Khalifah [8] and Billings [13] strongly suggest an association between CARV infection and BOS. The significance and directionality of this association remain to be determined.",

These same seasonal patterns have been found in HSCT recipients [26, 27] . Like most CARVs, RSV affects children more than adults, and this observation has been confirmed in single-center analyses where adult and pediatric HSCT programs coexist [28] . The epidemic nature of RSV infections must be stressed, because these outbreaks have been responsible for significant morbidity and mortality [14] . Several important factors may contribute to RSV outbreaks among HSCT or SOT recipients. On inpatient units, HSCT or SOT recipients tend to be housed on dedicated wards, thus exposing them to each other and also to a common group of hospital staff and care providers. In fall or winter seasons, 15% to 20% of these providers may shed RSV asymptomatically, and that number may increase to 50% during community outbreaks [29] . Additionally, HSCT or SOT recipients are more likely than immunocompetent patients to have prolonged shedding of RSV, thus introducing the potential for a single index case to infect many other patients [10, 29, 30] . Together, these factors may explain why multiple reported series of RSV infection note that more than 50% of cases were nosocomially acquired [27, 30, 31] .",

It is difficult, however, to compare the incidences reported in these trials directly, because study designs include longitudinal studies, single-year surveys, and prospective surveillance data. McCarthy and colleagues [32] reported a cumulative RSV incidence of 6.3% in allogeneic HSCT recipients over a 5-year period. Small and colleagues [28] reviewed consecutive HSCT recipients over a 6-year period and demonstrated an incidence of 8.8% in allogeneic HSCT recipients as compared with 1.5% in autologous HSCT recipients. Other reports have confirmed this higher rate in allogeneic HSCT recipients, including a multicenter European study that showed a single-year incidence of symptomatic RSV of 3.5% in recipients of allogeneic HSCT and of 0.4% in autologous HSCT recipients [34] . Longitudinal stud-ies of pediatric liver transplant recipients and adult lung transplant recipients showed incidence rates similar to the longitudinal studies, at 3.4% and 5% to 10%, respectively [12, 21] .",

Englund and colleagues [39] , however, reported concerning data in immunocompromised adults who had hematologic malignancies, in whom DFA testing on specimens from throat swabs and nasopharyngeal washing had a sensitivity of only 15%. When applied to specimens from BAL, the DFA was 70% to 90% sensitive [39] . These results parallel those reported by Billings and colleagues [17] , in which 67% of RSV diagnoses were made from BAL samples. The poor yield of DFA on easily obtained samples highlights the need for newer diagnostic tests or strategies.

Although generalization of so many studies is difficult, the preponderance of data suggests a benefit to ribavirin therapy, which may be augmented by the addition of nonspecific or RSV-specific intravenous immune globulin. This benefit has been demonstrated best in trials using aerosolized ribavirin, in contrast with decidedly mixed evidence for oral or intravenous ribavirin. This combination therapy is now endorsed in several sets of consensus guidelines [40, 41] , although most of the data on which this recommendation is made are from experience in treatment of HSCT recipients.

Several investigators, therefore, have sought to use ribavirin-based therapy for the treatment of documented RSV URI. Recent series by Ghosh and colleagues [42] and Small and colleagues [28] have demonstrated low rates of progression to pneumonia in HSCT recipients who had RSV URI and who received early therapy with ribavirin and intravenous immune globulin. Antiviral treatment of RSV URI is specifically not recommended by the American Society of Transplantation, however [40] . In the Ghosh [42] and Small [28] series, those patients progressing to pneumonia while receiving therapy also had low mortality rates in comparison with historical controls. Interestingly, the benefit of therapy for established pneumonia, which is recommended in the guidelines, has not been as clear in the literature [40] . Mortality rates in SOT or HSCT recipients who had respiratory failure caused by RSV pneumonia have been estimated at 90%, however [36] , and at least one consensus group does not favor treatment at that late stage [41] .",

Unlike most reports of RSV in HSCT recipients, PIV was found with similar frequency in recipients of allogeneic (5.2%) and autologous (5.5%) HSCT [18] . Among SOT recipients, case series of PIV have been reported in renal transplant [17] and lung transplant recipients [21 -23] . Between 1.6% and 11.9% of lung transplant recipients may develop PIV infection, although some may be asymptomatic infections detected during frequent bronchoscopies [22] . In lung transplant recipients, PIV-3 accounted for 63% of PIV isolates, PIV-1 for 29%, and PIV-2 for 8% [23] .",

The diagnosis of PIV infection usually is made with IFA or DFA testing of respiratory secretions, along with viral culture.

The virus can be cultured as well and is identified readily by characteristic smudge cells on histopathology. Because adenovirus frequently may be a reactivation disease, more sensitive assays, perhaps PCR based, may detect the infection more frequently. Further study is needed to determine whether patients who have more indolent adenovirus replication actually have clinical disease, or whether another pathogen is responsible for the clinical presentation.",

HSV-1 is suppressed effectively by agents used for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis, however, and reports of HSV-1 pneumonia have greatly decreased in the era of universal prophylaxis. At most centers, prophylactic acyclovir is given to suppress reactivation of herpes simplex disease even when the recipient and the donor are cytomegalovirus negative. Similarly, acyclovir and ganciclovir are active against varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which has been reported as a rare cause of pneumonia in SOT or HSCT recipients [56, 59, 61] . VZV may reactivate at any point in the posttransplantation course, and shingles is a common disease in all immunosuppressed populations. Because most cases of VZV pneumonia in HSCT or SOT recipients are preceded by the characteristic vesicular skin rash [61] , and because VZV pneumonia is rare, it is assumed that prompt antiviral therapy with acyclovir can abort the progression of reactivation disease to pneumonia. VZV pneumonia may be more of a concern in children or adult patients who have no innate immunity to VZV from either natural exposure or previous vaccination, because primary VZV infection is more likely to cause pneumonia.",

Active replication with both viruses can be detected, probably as reactivation of latent infection, in 20% to 50% of HSCT or SOT recipients [62] . Several authors have reported isolation of human herpesvirus 6 from sputum or lung tissue in patients who have otherwise idiopathic pneumonia after HSCT [62 -64] . The overall data, however, conflict as to whether a causative role can be established [62, 65] . Ross and colleagues [66] have reported HHV-7 in seven (100%) of seven lung transplant recipients who had early bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia and in three (75%) of four patients who had diffuse alveolar damage. In this series, HHV-7 was detected in 5 (19%) of 26 lung transplant recipients who had no pathology on biopsy and in 2 (14%) of 14 patients who had acute or chronic rejection (ie, BOS). These findings are thought-provoking and confirm the need for further research into the potential role of HHV-7 as a single or copathogen for certain patterns of pulmonary disease.",

The standard inactivated vaccine is composed of two influenza A and one influenza B strain. Vaccine composition varies annually based on predicted antigenic drifts and shifts in circulating virus; consequently, annual reimmunization is recommended for optimal protection. Live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine is not recommended for immunosuppressed hosts, including transplant recipients, or for family or health care providers who are in close contact with the patients. Numerous studies over several decades have examined vaccine responses in transplant recipients and have demonstrated conflicting results. In general, both humoral and cellular vaccine responses seem to be suboptimal when compared with healthy controls and cannot be reliably predicted based on the level of immunosuppression [70 -73] . Anecdotal reports have suggested a potential linkage between vaccination and organ rejection; however, this association has not been supported by the majority of studies examining the immunogenicity of vaccine in SOT recipients. Current recommendations support annual vaccination of all SOT recipients, although it is likely that those with more recent transplants may be less likely to respond to vaccine. HSCT recipients may be especially poor vaccine responders within the first 2 years after transplantation [46] . Prophylactic administration of licensed antiviral agents (including oseltamavir and zanamavir) may serve as an alternative preventive measure for individuals who are unable to receive influenza vaccination (eg, those with egg allergy) or who are anticipated to be especially Box 1.
