Anticoronavirus therapy is however challenging, as coronaviruses are biologically diverse and rapidly mutating. In this work, the antiviral activity of seven different carbon quantum dots (CQDs) for the treatment of human coronavirus HCoV-229E infections was investigated. The first generation of antiviral CQDs was derived from hydrothermal carbonization of ethylenediamine/citric acid as carbon precursors and postmodified with boronic acid ligands. These nanostructures showed a concentration-dependent virus inactivation with an estimated EC 50 of 52 \u00b1 8 \u03bcg mL \u22121 . CQDs derived from 4-aminophenylboronic acid without any further modification resulted in the second-generation of anti-HCoV nanomaterials with an EC 50 lowered to 5.2 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcg mL \u22121 . The underlying mechanism of action of these CQDs was revealed to be inhibition of HCoV-229E entry that could be due to interaction of the functional groups of the CQDs with HCoV-229E entry receptors; surprisingly, an equally large inhibition activity was observed at the viral replication step.",

The lack of targeted antiviral therapeutics as well as the constant emergence of new viruses make the search for antiviral agents a challenging and extremely needed research task. 1 As part of a global strategy to prevent epidemics, some severe emerging pathogens with great epidemic potential have been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO), 2 including, next to Ebola virus disease, the highly pathogenic human coronavirus (HCoV) infections. While circulating HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HKU1) cause relatively mild common cold-like respiratory tract infections, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) lead to pneumonia requiring hospitalization and intensive care. 3 A total of 2266 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, including 804 associated deaths, have been declared to the WHO until now, with a high case-fatality rate (35%). 4 As the virus is circulating in animals and humans, it may undergo further adaptation and cause a pandemic. Therefore, therapeutic options are urgently needed.",

            "text": "In this work, we investigate the potential of functional carbon quantum dots (CQDs) as inhibitors of host cells infection by HCoV-229E coronavirus ( Figure 1 ). CQDs with an average diameter below 10 nm and excellent water dispersion are highly attractive for nanomedical applications due to a lack of visible signs of toxicity in animals. 11 They can be synthesized quickly via several different inexpensive and simple methods, and their excellent optical properties offer in vivo tracking possibilities. It was recently demonstrated that CQDs are suitable scaffolds to interfere with the entry of viruses into cells. 12\u221214 Boronic acidmodified CQDs were able to inhibit, for example, HIV-1 entry by suppressing syncytium formation. 13 Some of us have shown lately the potential of CQDs-functionalized with boronic acid and amine moieties to interfere with the entry of herpes simplex virus type 1. 12 Han and co-workers reported the potential of CQDs as viral inhibitors by activation of type I interferon responses. 14 This unique study reveals that boronic acid functions can be responsible for the anti-HCoV activity. CQDs derived from citric acid/ethylenediamine and further conjugated by \"click\" chemistry with boronic acid functions display an effective 50% inhibition concentration EC 50 = 52 \u00b1 8 \u03bcg mL \u22121 . Likewise, CQDs derived from 4-aminophenylboronic acid and phenylboronic acid without any further modification exhibit antiviral behavior with a decreased effective EC 50 down to 5.2 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcg mL \u22121 . The underlying mechanism of action of these CQDs was revealed to be the CQDs interaction with the HCoV-229E S protein. Surprisingly, an equally large inhibition activity was observed at the viral replication step. 15, 16 To test if such concepts can be extrapolated to human coronavirus HCoV-229E infections, boronic acid functional groups were chemically integrated onto CQDs-1 formed through hydrothermal carbonization of ethylenediamine/citric acid ( Figure 2A ). The approach consists of sealing the organic precursors in a Teflon-lined autoclave chamber and performing the formation of CQDs at elevated temperature under reduced pressure for 5 h. The pH value of the resulting CQDs suspensions was found to be 7.2 \u00b1 0.2 (n = 5). To remove larger precipitates, the as-obtained CQDs suspension was first centrifuged and then dialyzed against water for 24 h with a final yield of CQDs of 40%. CQDs-1 exhibit a spherical shape with an average diameter of 4.5 \u00b1 0.2 nm ( Figure 2B ). XPS analysis (Table 1) indicates the presence of C, O, and N. The C 1s highresolution XPS spectrum of CQDs-1 depicts three different carbon features: the graphitic C\ue0c8C at 283.4 eV, 284.9 eV (C\u2212H), and 286.4 eV (C\u2212O, C\u2212N) ( Figure 2C ). Analysis of the N 1s high-resolution XPS shows the presence surface NH 2 groups (399.9 eV) ( Figure 2D ). The Raman spectrum of the CQD-1 ( Figure 2E ) displays the characteristic G band at 1570 cm \u22121 related to in-plane vibration of sp 2 carbon, and the D band at 1350 cm \u22121 attributed to disorder and defects. The ratio of the intensity of these bands (I D /I G ), used to express the extent of sp 2 /sp 3 hybridization of carbon atoms, 17 is found to be 0.93 \u00b1 0.15 for all particles. 18 XRD patterns indicate their crystalline nature (see Figure S1A ) with a broad diffraction peak centered at 25.5\u00b0corresponding to an interlayer spacing of 0.35 nm. This is larger than the spacing between (100) planes in bulk graphite (0.23 nm) due to the incorporation of functional groups along the edges of the CQDs. 19 The UV\u2212vis of CQDs-1 (see Figure S1B ) reveals an absorption maximum at \u223c242 nm attributed to \u03c0\u2212\u03c0* transition of C\ue0c8C and a band at 344 nm due to n\u2212\u03c0* transition of C\ue0c8O and C\ue0c8N bonds. 20, 21 The fluorescence quantum yield (QY) is 0.33 as compared to that of quinine sulfate used as reference (QY, 0.54 in 0.12 M H 2 SO 4 ) (see Figure S1C ). A wavelength-dependent fluorescence emission is observed (see Figure S1D ) where upon increasing the excitation wavelength, the emission gradually shifts to the red region with an increase in fluorescence intensity. The phenomenon of excitation-dependent emission is typical for such nanostructures. 5\u22127 The zeta potential and hydrodynamic size of the CQDs-1 are summarized in Table 1 .",

The green fluorescence, which is attributed to the CQDs-3, is homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm after 1 h when incubated at 37\u00b0C, which confirms the internalization of CQDs-3 inside the cells.

The antiviral activity of CQDs-1, CQDs-3, and CQDs-4 was evaluated on Huh-7 cell monolayers, infected with HCoV-229E-Luc ( Figure 4A ). Addition of CQDs-1 after 1 h infection and further incubation for 6 h at 37\u00b0C shows no inhibition of infection. This contrasts to CQDs-3 where a concentrationdependent virus inactivation is observed with an estimated EC 50 = 52 \u00b1 8 \u03bcg mL \u22121 ( Figure 4B ). Addition of mannose to CQDs-3 results in a complete loss of antiviral activity of the latter at low particle concentrations, with some antiviral activity above 50 \u03bcg mL \u22121 CQDs. These data reveal two important findings. First, it highlights that boronic acid functions, where the mode of action is the selective and reversible formation of tetravalent complexes with cis-diols and thus glycan units, 24 are interacting with HCoV-229E. CQDs-3 are in this context speculated to be pseudolectins, targeting the S protein of HCoV-229E via a lectin\u2212carbohydrate binding mechanism, similar to that of the oligomannose-specific lectin Griffithsin. 25 Thus, the presence of mannose is blocking the antiviral activity in favor of this mechanistic behavior. The presence of some antiviral activity of the mannose saturated CQDs-3 might be due to the presence of the triazole function on the particles' surface. Indeed, the control particles CQDs-4, bearing no boronic acid function but a triazole ring, display some antiviral activity, even though largely decreased when compared to CQDs-3.",

The inhibition is not significantly different for the entry step as compared to the replication step. This suggests that, in addition to its major effect on HCoV-229E entry, CQDs can also affect the genomic replication of this virus.

Three of these CQDs (CQDs-3, -5, -6) were shown to interfere significantly with HCoV-229E-Luc infection in a concentration-dependent manner, while CQDs-4 showed a very moderate antiviral activity. The estimated EC 50 value decreased considerably from CQDs-3, boronic acidmodified quantum dots, derived from ethylenediamine/citric acid as carbon precursors (EC 50 = 52 \u00b1 8 \u03bcg mL \u22121 ) to 5.2 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcg mL \u22121 in the case of CQDs-6. While the presence of boronic acid functions proved to be vital for covering CQDs-3 with antiviral activity, CQDs-5 and CQDS-6 did not carry a substantial amount of boronic acid functions, as revealed by 11 B NMR and validated by mannose addition experiments. These findings reveal the complex nature of identifying viral inhibitors for human coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E-Luc. Mechanistic studies suggest that the particles are acting at the early state of virus infection through the inhibition of entry that could be due to inhibition of protein S-receptor interaction with the host cell membrane. All different particles interfere in addition with the viral replication step, something less common. These results are extremely encouraging to replace currently used antiviral agents such a ribavirin and IFN known to have major side effects such as confusion, short-term memory loss, deficits in executive functions, as well as extrapyramidal effects. Further experimental confirmations are required if this approach can be extrapolated to other coronaviruses, notably to the clinically relevant MERS-CoV, to validate the potential of these nanostructures as alternative anti-MERS therapeutics and approaches to confront this severe and life-threatening disease. Also, how such particles work in vivo has to be shown in the future. ",
