            "text": "workers from all over China have been participating in the fight against this highly contagious disease in Hubei province, which is the infected center of China. The skin damages caused by enhanced infection-prevention measures among them, which could reduce their enthusiasm for overloaded work and make them anxious, have been reported frequently. Previous studies have revealed that hand eczema was quite common in healthcare workers 1,2 , and the risk factors included frequent hand hygiene and long time of gloves wearing. 3,4 Considering the frequent hand hygiene and long-time wearing of tertiary protective devices ((N95 mask, goggles, face shield and double-layers gloves) among healthcare workers during the epidemic period of COVID-19, we aim to estimate the prevalence, clinical features and risk factors of these skin damages among them. From January to February 2020, self-administered on-line questionnaires were distributed to 700 individuals consisting of physicians and nurses who worked in the designated departments of tertiary hospitals in Hubei, China. The questionnaire included questions about the condition of skin damages and the frequency or duration of several infection-prevention measures (Supplemental Material 1). Finally, 542 individuals (Supplemental Material 2) completed the study (response rate, 77.4%), with 71.4% (387/542) working in isolation wards (IW) and 28.6% (155/542) working in fever clinic (FC). The general prevalence rate of skin damages caused by enhanced infection-prevention measures was 97.0% (526/542) among first-line healthcare workers. The affected sites included nasal bridge, hands, cheek and forehead, and nasal bridge was the most commonly affected (83.1%). Among a series of symptoms and signs, dryness/tightness and desquamation were the most common symptom (70.3%) and sign (61.6%), respectively (Table 1). The healthcare workers who wore some medical devices over 6 hours had higher risks of skin damages in corresponding sites than those who did less time [ (N95 masks: OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.35-3.01, P < 0.01), Goggles: (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.41-3.83, P < 0.01) ]. Whereas longer time of face shield wearing was not a significant risk factor in causing forehead skin damages (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.93-2.50, P = 0.66). The more frequent (>10 times/d) hand hygiene but longer time of gloves wearing could increase the risk of hands skin damages (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.38-3.43, P < 0.01) (",
