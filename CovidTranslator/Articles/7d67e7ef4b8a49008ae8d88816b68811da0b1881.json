Four vectors, DNA, SFV, human serotype 5 adenovirus (HuAd5) and Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) poxvirus, all expressing hepatitis C virus Core, E1, E2 and NS3, were combined in three prime-boost regimen, and their ability to elicit immune responses against HCV antigens in rhesus macaques was explored and compared. All combinations induced specific T-cell immune responses, including high IFN-\u03b3 production. The group immunized with the SFV+MVA regimen elicited higher E2-specific responses as compared with the two other modalities, while animals receiving HuAd5 injections elicited lower IL-4 responses as compared with those receiving MVA. The IFN-\u03b3 responses to NS3 were remarkably similar between groups. Only the adenovirus induced envelope-specific antibody responses, but these failed to show neutralizing activity. Therefore, the two novel regimens failed to induce superior responses as compared with already existing HCV vaccine candidates. Differences were found in response to envelope proteins, but the relevance of these remain uncertain given the surprisingly poor correlation with immunogenicity data in chimpanzees, underlining the difficulty to predict efficacy from immunology studies.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) vaccine candidates inducing HCV-specific immune responses may protect naive chimpanzees from heterologous experimental challenge; however, the mechanism behind protection remains elusive. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Although information regarding the immune correlates of protective immunity is incomplete, sufficient evidence points toward a pivotal role for a potent functional cellular immune response against several HCV proteins. [7] [8] [9] [10] Vaccine strategies inducing such strong cellular immunity in mice, rhesus macaques and humans often combine priming of the immune system with booster immunizations using DNA and recombinant viral vectors, including adenovirus and modified virus Ankara (MVA). 10, 11 Preclinical evaluation of the potential efficacy of HCV vaccine candidates is limited to the chimpanzee and humanized mouse models. 8, [12] [13] [14] Several HCV vaccine candidates have been created, including viral vectors and typically encoding multiple target antigens, and relied on preclinical immunogenicity studies in non-human primates such as rhesus macaques. 8, [15] [16] [17] Comparison of different vectors and regimen in non-human primates is highly valuable for HCV vaccine development, to shed light on factors specifically influencing HCV vaccine immunogenicity as well as providing technological improvement in the field of genetic vaccination, as is performed in HIV development. 18 In a recent study, HCV adenovirus vaccine boosting induced robust cellular responses, HCV pseudoparticles enhanced the humoral response, and poxvirus priming induced both humoral and cellular responses. Immune responses were optimized with heterologous prime-boost regimens. 16 Vectors included plasmid DNA, recombinant SFV, replicationincompetent adenovirus and poxvirus (MVA) encoding the structural HCV antigens Core (C), the two envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2, and the non-structural antigen NS3 were developed and evaluated for immunogenicity in mice, alone or in various prime-boost combinations. These vectors successfully elicited cellular and humoral immune responses including in HLA-A2 mice. 19 Moreover, a DNA-DNA-MVA-MVA vaccine regimen induced robust immune responses associated with an early control of heterologous HCV infection in chimpanzees. 20 In the present study, we explored the B-and T-cell immune responses induced by this vaccine in rhesus macaques and investigated whether two different immunization regimens, not investigated to date, have the potential to improve the HCV-specific immune responses: DNA followed by adenovirus and SFV followed by MVA. We characterized the immune responses to each of the four vaccine antigens induced by the three regimens in rhesus macaques, and evaluated the predictive value of the rhesus macaque as a model for HCV vaccine immunogenicity by comparing the immune response observed in rhesus macaques after DNA-MVA to those observed in chimpanzees after the exact same DNA-MVA vaccine regimen. 20 ",

While lymphoproliferative responses were induced in all animals, only a limited subset of animals elicited detectable antigen-specific cytokine responses after DNA or SFV priming.

This could be due to differences in the constructs rather than the delivery vector: for technical reasons, the E2 gene was inserted in a E1-E2 expressing SFV particle as opposed to a combined C-E1-E2 as in the DNA, adenovirus and MVA vectors. Therefore, differences may be due to different levels of antigen expression from each vector, or whether the antigens are presented on the cell surfaces.

Regarding the boosting potential of HuAd5, T-cell responses were relatively similar between the DNA+HuAd5 and DNA+MVA groups. Trends were observed indicating higher proliferation with MVA-boosted and higher IFN-\u03b3 responses in the HuAd5-boosted groups, but these were not statistically significant. The absence of significant differences may be due to the low number of animals per group, a limitation that is a direct consequence of working with non-human primates. In addition, the respective immunogenicity of adenovirus and MVA vaccines may be partially antigen dependent, as the effect of each antigen immunomodulatory property may also influence the cytokine microenvironment induced by the vector. For example, HuAd5 and MVA have been compared in the context of other antigens: HuAd5 was found superior to poxviruses for induction of IFN-\u03b3 T-cell responses to malaria antigens, 23 while MVA encoding the MTB 85A antigen induces stronger IFN-\u03b3 producing T cells after a BCG prime. 24 All three vaccine strategies induced Th1-biased immune responses, with IFN-\u03b3 responses largely exceeding the IL-4 responses. A striking difference observed, however, was the lower IL-4 response in the HuAd5-immunized animals, revealing a more Th1 bias. However, while MVA has been shown to induce antibody response to different antigens such as CMV, 25 SARS, 26 Flu 27 and blood-stage malaria, 28 in this study only the HuAd5 vector induced a strong but transient antibody response to one of the two envelope proteins. This is in agreement with other recent HCV vaccine developments demonstrating the capacity of adenovirus boosts to support envelope-specific antibodies, 29 but confirm that caution should be taken when trying to use results from different immunogens to influence the design of vaccines for other diseases. However, the antibody response elicited by HuAd5 immunization in our study was not neutralizing and was shortlived, maybe inducing antibodies masking the neutralization epitopes as recently described. 5, 30 The absence of functional activity or persistence of antibodies using viral vectors was also previously observed. [31] [32] [33] This study offers the unique opportunity to compare the immune response elicited by the DNA+MVA regimen between rhesus macaques and chimpanzees. The exact same constructs and regimen were used to immunize four chimpanzees. 20 In chimpanzees, immunization induced robust multi-specific immune responses in all four animals, which, following HCV1b exposure, was associated with a drastic reduction in the peak viremia and RNA levels in liver during the acute phase of infection. The vaccine regimen induced IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 responses as detected by ELISPOT, with a similar pattern to the one observed in rhesus macaques (strong IFN-\u03b3 responses and lower IL-2 responses, especially to NS3). Contrary to rhesus macaques, however, the chimpanzees mounted more potent IL-4 responses with numbers of antigen-specific IL-4 producing cells comparable to the number of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells in three out of the four animals. 20 The most striking difference between the two primate species was that DNA+MVA regime induced a robust antibody response in all chimpanzees against both E1 and E2. It is possible that the stronger IL-4 response observed in chimpanzees supported the more potent B-cell response, but the reason for the difference is unknown, and the IL-4 response was not absent in rhesus macaques, just lower than the IFN-\u03b3 response. This underlines the difficulty to predict the immunogenicity of a specific vaccine regime based on only one primate species, and to unravel the relative contribution of cellular and humoral immunity to prevent acute or chronic disease. With the availability of highly efficient antiviral drug treatments able to cure a large proportion of HCV infections, the relevance and cost of HCV vaccine development is questioned. However, the treatments are extremely expensive, particularly for developing countries, and thus a vaccine for preventing or treating HCV infection still has an indication in high prevalence countries. 34, 35 While the strong restrictions on research involving chimpanzees will restrict efficacy studies, expensive phase II clinical trials will become the only possibility for evaluating the efficacy of vaccine candidates. Therefore, studies identifying approaches that are or not optimal, and investigating the predictive value of non-human primates are highly relevant in this context.",
