NPs are now at the forefront of health care. People trust nurses and NPs. Patients as well as neighbors, friends, acquaintances, and strangers look to us because we listen, approach health and illness holistically, and bring a foundation of nursing to everything we do. The world is changing rapidly, but can we keep up? Are we ready?",

I never thought it was possible, but I actually watched the kitchen floor roll like an ocean wave. I quickly moved my 4 young children under our heavy German-made table, where we experienced multiple violent aftershocks. For several days, not even the birds made a sound. Our main concern was fresh food and water, because we lost all electricity and power. It hit me that many people live every day with these concerns.",

Experts on the influenza epidemic of 1918 report that it is likely we will experience something similar on a global scale, but no one knows when. 3 We must anticipate and prepare for global infection by being proactive rather than reactive.",
