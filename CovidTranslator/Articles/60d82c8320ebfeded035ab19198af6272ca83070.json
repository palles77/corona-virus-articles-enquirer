Dobrava-Belgrad virus, transmitted by striped field mice, causes infections in the north and east of the country. Serological tests are available for primary and confirmatory diagnosis; moreover, viral nucleic acids can be amplified in the early phase of illness and compared with the viral nucleic acids from the reservoir hosts of the corresponding type of infection. Infections with American types of hantavirus have ca. 35% case fatality, and hantaviruses from southeastern Europe and Asia are also highly pathogenic; in contrast, the febrile illnesses caused by hantaviruses in Germany are usually relatively mild.",

In addition to the repeated transmission of influenzaviruses from animals to humans, the threat from the new corona viruses is also under intense discussion. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it was only recently that a new coronavirus, HCoV-EMC-which triggers lung infections with high case fatality-was introduced into Germany (1). This virus is assumed to be transmitted to humans by certain species of bat (2) . Another zoonotic disease, which affects many more patients, is hantavirus disease (3, 4) . Human pathogenic hantaviruses are transmitted to humans from infected rodents. However, these viruses have recently also been shown to be present in shrews, moles, and now even bats (5) .",

In Germany, the most striking features of hantavirus disease are initially high fever and impaired renal function. Although this infectious disease was almost unknown in Germany until quite recently, both among doctors and among the general public, hantavirus disease (along with norovirus and rotavirus disease, flu, and hepatitis C) is among the five most common notifiable viral diseases today.

In severe cases, the patient requires dialysis or extracorporeal oxygenation. Externally visible bleeding is typical of infection by the hantaviruses found in Asia, and for this reason the World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested the name \"hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome\" (HFRS). In hantavirus-induced cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), which is caused by hantaviruses circulating in America, the striking features are hypoxia and bilateral interstitial pulmonary infiltrates that start 2 days after disease onset (3, 7) . Since, however, organ damage is not always restricted to the main target organ, and HFRS in Europe is associated with much less external hemorrhage than in Asia, the general term \"hantavirus disease\" is coming into increasing use (12) .

So far as is known at present, the large disease outbreaks that occurred in 2007, 2010, and 2012 were caused by the Puumala virus (17, 18) . The virus's natural host is the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), a cricetine rodent that is ubiquitous in Germany. A second human pathogenic hantavirus in Germany is a variant (Kurkino genotype) of the Dobrava-Belgrade virus, transmitted by the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius). The Dobrava-Belgrade virus exists in various genotypes (19) . In Germany, infection of humans by this virus have so far only been described in the north and north-east of the country. This is because the distribution of the striped field mouse is restricted to those parts of Germany. In addition, a third hantavirus, the Tula virus, is present in the common vole (Microtus arvalis) and related cricetine rodents. It is not yet known how important the Tula virus is as a pathogen in humans; so far only one case of disease has been associated with infection by this virus (20) . Finally, two hantaviruses (Seewis virus and Asikkala virus) have been demonstrated in shrews in Germany, but their pathogenicity for humans is unclear at present (21, 22) .",

This increase in the population density of rodents is taken to be due to climatic factors and beech mast in the preceding year. Mild and snowy winters probably favor survival of the animals, which then achieve a high population density in the year of the outbreak. The denser the population and the more prevalent the virus in the animal hosts, the more likely it is that transmission to humans as accidental hosts will take place. This therefore suggests a connection between mass reproduction in the bank vole and hantavirus outbreaks in humans. Interestingly, in both winter 2009/spring 2010 and in winter 2011/spring 2012, there was a rise in the number of reported cases very early in the season. Whether such observations can be used as a future early warning system of hantavirus outbreaks remains to be elucidated by further studies.",

The hitherto inadequate state of knowledge about the occurrence of Tula virus infections could also be due to the antigenic relationship between Tula virus and Puumala virus.

Genetically engineered vaccines that exist at the laboratory stage have so far not been adopted into development programs by the pharmaceutical industry. For this reason, the main focus of attempts to protect humans from infection is prevention of exposure, i.e., preventing transmission of the pathogen from animal to human. Hantavirus infections could be largely prevented if contact with the voles and their secretions could be prevented (29). This involves controlling the voles in and around human dwellings. When working in places where voles may have been (e.g., when cleaning out stables, sheds, or summer houses at the end of the winter), especially in endemic areas, single-use gloves and masks that fit closely over nose and mouth (e.g., the FFP3 respiratory masks available from DIY stores) should be worn. When out of doors, contact with vole nests and secretions should likewise be avoided. Other measures are to keep food safely both indoors and out of doors, and to disinfect and appropriately dispose of any trapped or dead voles. Since the infection can be transmitted by rodents kept in the laboratory, such as brown rats, common voles and bank voles, these animals too should be regularly examined for any persistent hantavirus infection-even though at present this is only prescribed for brown rats by the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA).",

In addition, targeted training courses are needed for hospital physicians and those in private practice-especially in endemic areas-to familiarize them with the symptoms of the disease. The improved understanding of the (immune) pathogenesis underlying hantavirus disease could lead to novel therapeutic pathways. One task to be performed is molecular epidemiological mapping of the outbreak areas at the finest resolution possible and-connected with this-to determine precisely the place where patients were infected, by molecular analyses of viral samples.
