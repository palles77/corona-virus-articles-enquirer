            "text": "Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer, responsible for the majority of skin cancer related deaths. Thus, the search for natural molecules which can effectively destroy tumors while promoting immune activation is essential for designing novel therapies against metastatic melanoma. Here, we report for the first time that a natural triterpenoid, Ganoderic Acid DM (GA-DM), induces an orchestrated autophagic and apoptotic cell death, as well as enhanced immunological responses via increased HLA class II presentation in melanoma cells. Annexin V staining and flow cytometry showed that GA-DM treatment induced apoptosis of melanoma cells, which was supported by a detection of increased Bax proteins, co-localization and elevation of Apaf-1 and cytochrome c, and a subsequent cleavage of caspases 9 and 3. Furthermore, GA-DM treatment initiated a possible cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis as evidenced by increased levels of Beclin-1 and LC3 proteins, and their timely interplay with apoptotic and/or anti-apoptotic molecules in melanoma cells. Despite GA-DM's moderate cytotoxicity, viable cells expressed high levels of HLA class II proteins with improved antigen presentation and CD4+ T cell recognition. The antitumor efficacy of GA-DM was also investigated in vivo in murine B16 melanoma model, where GA-DM treatment slowed tumor formation with a significant reduction in tumor volume. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the potential of GA-DM as a natural chemo-immunotherapeutic capable of inducing a possible cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis, as well as improved immune recognition for sustained melanoma tumor clearance.",

Among human tumors, melanoma has one of the poorest prognosis, with mean survival <1 year in patients with unresectable distant metastases [3] . In these patients with metastatic melanoma, 5 year survival is <10% with a mean of 4-6 months [4, 5] . The lessinvasive treatment options for melanoma include: radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, but these have proved rather ineffective in treating the disease [6, 7] . Standard therapies have also failed to show any meaningful impact on survival, and in those patients who do show a positive initial response, a rapid deterioration often ensues with the exception of the recently discovered monoclonal antibody, ipilimumab, which has shown a significant survival benefitin metastatic melanoma [3, 8] . Over the past three decades, the incidence of melanoma has increased more rapidly than all other solid malignancies, and it is now the sixth most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the United States [4] . The steady increase in the incidence of melanoma has resulted in a dire need for relatively low-cost therapies with greater efficacy.",

Another less well-defined survival pathway of drug-induced cell death is autophagy, a process within the cell utilizing lysosomal machinery to sequester and degrade its own molecules [10] . Autophagy is crucial for the recycling of cellular components to generate nutrients and enable survival in times of cellular stress. However, excessive autophagy may lead to cell death following the hallmarks typical of apoptotic events [11] . Apoptosis and autophagy are distinct cellular processes, with distinguished molecular mediators. Nevertheless, there could be cross-talk between the two pathways, which may regulate cell death/survival pathway under particular cellular conditions. Understanding this delicate balance might help investigators design new anticancer therapeutics, which modulate both of these cellular processes to reduce tumor burden.",

Intracellular proteins or tumor fragments may get access to vacuolar compartments by sequestration in double-membrane organelles or autophagosomes, which can then fuse with vesicles of the endolysosomal compartments where antigen processing and peptide loading onto HLA class II proteins take place [19] [20] [21] . Recent studies suggest that cellular autophagic activity could give rise to HLA class II ligands for CD4+ T cell recognition [19, 22, 23] . Thus, our current study has also investigated whether this natural product GA-DM could influence intracellular machinery of melanoma cells for HLA class II processing and presentation to T cells for immune recognition. We report that GA-DM treatment induces autophagic and apoptotic events as well as immune activation in human melanoma cells, which may be important in the regulation of cancer development and progression, and in determining the response of tumor cells to anticancer therapy. We also show that GA-DM treatment reduces tumor burden in vivo in a B16 mouse melanoma model. Our current findings highlight the potential of GA-DM as a natural chemo-immunotherapeutic capable of inducing tumor destruction and also activating a possible immune response imperative to sustain melanoma tumor remission.",

Following treatment, tumor volumes were determined at periodic intervals using a digital caliper by measuring the longest diameter (a) and the next longest diameter (b) perpendicular to (a). Using these measurements, the tumor volume was calculated by the formula: V=ab 2 \u00d7 \u03c0/6 [33] . The mice were kept under observation until tumor volume was determined to be 1400 mm 3 at which point they were requisitely euthanized owing to the size of the tumor. In some experiments, tumor tissues obtained from GA-DM (50 mg/kg) or vehicle-only treated mice at days 14, 17, and 19 after B16 melanoma implantation, were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for T cell infiltration. Tumor samples were first fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin and stained with CD3-\u03b5 antibody at our Hollings Cancer Center immunohistochemistry facility. Treatment or control groups consisted of 6 mice (n=6), and the data shown were representative of at least three separate experiments.

Cells were simultaneously treated with vehicle alone (DMSO) or serial doses of GA-DM (10-80 \u03bcM), and the detrimental effects were measured by MTS assay as described in the Methods. Results showed that GA-DM reduced the viability of all tested melanoma cells in a dose-dependent manner with a mean IC 50 of 25.5\u00b13.4\u03bcM (Fig. 1A) . A time course study (3, 6, 12, and 24 h treatment) was also performed using 20 and 40 \u03bcM of GA-DM and two melanoma cell lines J3 and HT-144 (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). Data showed that at early time points (3-6 h), both 20 and 40 \u03bcM of GA-DM concentrations were not effective in killing melanoma cells (Supplemental Fig. 1A and B). At later time points (12-24 h), 20 \u03bcM of GA-DM induced detectable cell death; but, 40 \u03bcM of GA-DM was very effective in inducing cytotoxicity in both cell lines (Supplemental Fig. 1B) . To detect apoptotic changes induced by GA-DM, J3 melanoma cells were incubated (10 min) with Hoechst dye, which is commonly used to stain genomic DNA. Hoechst staining of J3 cells showed that GA-DM treatment induced apoptotic events characteristic of chromatin condensation. Microscopic observation in Fig. 1B demonstrates typical morphology of apoptotic nuclei stained with Hoechst, in which chromatin was condensed and aggregated at the nuclear membrane as indicated by a bright fluorescence at the periphery. Also, DNA fragmentation assay showed that GA-DM (40 \u03bcM) treatment induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in J3 cells (Fig 1C) . A known apoptosis inducer, staurosporine (1 \u03bcM), was used as a positive control which also showed internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in the same gel [29] . Thus, the chromatin condensation detected in Fig 1B, may be a consequence of DNA cleavage within the dying J3 cells. Further analysis of cell cycle progression suggested that GA-DM treatment caused G1 arrest in J3 melanoma cells (Supplemental Fig. 2) . GA-DM treatment also induced dosedependent anti-proliferative activities by inducing apoptotic events in mouse B16 melanoma cells (Supplemental Fig. 3 , and data not shown).",

Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates showed that GA-DM treatment induced a concurrent surge of active forms of caspases 3 and 9 proteins in J3 and HT-144 cells, suggesting the role of caspases in executing melanoma cell death. Caspase activation was indicated by the cleavage of pro-caspases 3 and 9, to a number of catalytic subunits ( Fig. 2A) . In order to test whether in vitro caspase inhibition could reverse cytotoxicity, we used a pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK known to bind to the catalytic sites of active caspases rendering them inactive. Briefly, J3 and HT-144 cells were treated with GA-DM (40 \u03bcM) in the presence or absence of Z-VAD-FMK (50 \u03bcM) for 3-24 h (Fig. 2B and 2C ). Data showed that inhibition of caspases by Z-VAD-FMK at early time points (3-6 h) did not alter GA-DM-induced cell death. However, at later time points (12-24 h) , inhibition of caspases significantly reversed cell death in both J3 and HT-144 cell lines. These data suggest that GA-DM treatment may initiate a time-dependent processing and activation of cell survival and apoptotic proteins in melanoma cells.",

Western blot analysis showed that GA-DM treatment reduced survivin protein expression, but up-regulated the expression levels of Bax proteins in whole cell lysates of J3 and HT-144 cells (Fig. 3A, B) . No significant changes in Bcl-2 protein expression were detected in both J3 and HT-144 cells ( Fig. 3A and B) . Meanwhile, GA-DM treatment caused a significant increase of apoptotic cytochrome c in the cytosolic fraction of J3 cells, along with the induction of Apaf-1 (Fig. 3C) . The disturbance of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio further suggests the role of GA-DM in inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and the increase of cytosolic cytochrome c in melanoma cells. Experiments using TMRE staining of J3 melanoma cells confirmed that GA-DM treatment caused significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential preceding cytochrome c release (Fig. 3D) . The release of cytochrome c may also subsequently promote Apaf-1 oligomerization, which in the presence of caspase 9 could form a large multimeric apoptosome, activating the downstream caspase cascades [34] . Immunofluorescence studies confirmed a remarkable upregulation and colocalization of cytochrome c (green) and Apaf-1 (red) proteins in the cytoplasm of GA-DMtreated J3 melanoma cells, implying apoptosome formation can trigger cellular apoptosis (Fig.4A) . Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis of annexin V and propidium iodide-stained melanoma cells showed measurable increased levels of apoptotic events developed in GA-DM-treated cells compared to those treated with vehicle alone (Fig.4B) . Apparently, both early and late apoptotic events were most prominent in J3 cells treated with GA-DM for 24 h (gated in R2: 1.8% in control and 19% in treated cells). Taken together, these data indicate that GA-DM treatment can activate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis where caspase processing plays a key role in melanoma cell death.",

To evaluate the role of GA-DM in the induction autophagy, we conducted a post-treatment timeline western blotting to analyze changes in autophagic protein Beclin-1 that has long been identified as a Bcl-2-interacting partner [35, 37, 38] . Results showed a significant increase in Beclin-1 protein expression at 3-6 h after GA-DM treatment, which was drastically declined after 12 h of treatment ( Figure 5A, B) . These data indicate a possible binding of Beclin-1 to the survival protein Bcl-2, triggering apoptotic events characterized by the activation of caspase 3. We also monitored GA-DM-treated cells for another autophagic protein LC3, which is a marker of autophagosome formation [38] . Our results showed that GA-DM treatment induced a time-dependent activation of LC3 protein that reached a peak at about 6 h post-treatment, suggesting that treated melanoma cells underwent autophagy as a possible survival mechanism (Fig. 5A, B) . Concurrent timeline cytototoxic assay in the presence or absence of an autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, showed that blocking autophagic events at relatively earlier time points (3-6 h) induced cell death (Fig. 5C ). By contrast, remarkable cell execution occurred beyond 12 h of treatment regardless of 3-MA treatment (Fig. 5C) , indicating that excessive autophagy may have triggered a subsequent caspase dependent apoptotic pathway. Taken together, these data suggest the potential of autophagy and apoptosis cross-talk as a possible mechanism of action for effective antitumor responses, which can be exploited for melanoma therapies.",

In order to evaluate whether GA-DM-induced autophagy in melanoma cells influenced intracellular HLA class II proteins and their presentation to CD4+ T cells, J3.DR4 and HT-144 cells were subjected to western blotting and functional antigen presentation assays. Data showed a significant upregulation of HLA class II molecules as well as lysosomal LAMP-2 proteins in GA-DM-treated melanoma cells (Fig. 5A, D) , which correlated with early autophagic events as evidenced by Beclin-1 expression in those cells. Further analysis of HLA class II components by western blotting showed a significant increase in HLA-DR and HLA-DM proteins with a differential Ii expression (Fig. 6A,B) , indicating the activation of HLA class II antigen processing machinery in GA-DM-treated melanoma cells. However, no significant changes in heat shock proteins (both Hsp70 and Hsp90) in GA-DM-treated cells were observed as analyzed by western blotting (data not shown), indicating that chaperone-mediated autophagy may not be involved in cellular stress, but rather macroautophagy played a role in HLA class II activation [18] [19] [20] . Cell-mediated immune activation and recognition of GA-DM-treated melanoma cells were also examined in vitro by using whole HSA protein or HSA 64-76K peptide as a model for the study of antigen processing and presentation to specific CD4+T cells. Results showed that GA-DM (20 \u03bcM) treatment increased HLA class II antigen presentation and CD4+ T cell recognition of melanoma tumor cells (Fig. 6C) . It was also observed that 20 \u03bcM of GA-DM enhanced HSA processing and presentation via HLA class II proteins, although a decline in antigen presentation was observed in treatment with higher doses (40 \u03bcM and above) of GA-DM (data not shown). This is not unexpected as higher doses of GA-DM induced significant cytotoxicity and cell death. However, the remaining viable tumor cells remained capable of inducing T cell responses.",

Mice were injected i.p. with GA-DM (50 mg/kg) or control vehicle at days 7 and 10 following the subcutaneous implantation of B16 melanoma tumor cells as described. Data showed that GA-DM treatment reduced the normal growth of B16 tumor (Fig. 7A) , which resulted in a significant diminution in tumor volume of treated mice that lasted up to three weeks after tumor implantation (Fig. 7B) . After day 21, treated mice still possessed a reduced tumor volume at least until day 23, as compared to untreated mice (Supplemental Fig. 5 ). Our data also showed that all the mice developed tumors, and the GA-DM-treated mice develop smaller tumors overall. Immunohistochemical analysis with anti-CD3 staining confirmed host T cell infiltration at a greater extent in tumor tissues of treated mice than those treated with the vehicle alone (Fig. 7 C) . These findings suggest that GA-DM may serve as a potential chemo-and immunotherapeutic natural product for attenuation of melanoma growth in vivo.",

However, inherent or acquired resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy has been a major obstacle to complete treatment and sufficiently prevent tumor reoccurrence. Therefore, the search for new natural drugs that sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy-mediated apoptosis, while also restoring antitumor immunity has increasingly become a focus of investigation [9, 39] . More recently, exploiting other mechanisms, such as autophagy, has emerged as a potential strategy to induce tumor cell death [11, 40] . In this study, we have shown that GA-DM, a natural product of the medicinal mushroom Ganoderma lucidum, not only inhibited proliferation and killed human metastatic melanoma in low micromolar concentrations, but also significantly restored immune recognition of tumor cells. We also provide evidence that GA-DM induces an orchestrated molecular cross-talk with an early autophagy that may contribute to apoptotic cell death.",

Apoptotic cell death was carried out through upregulation and cleavage of initiator caspase 9 and executioner caspase 3. Biochemical analysis showed that caspase protein expression was correlated with a surge of cellular caspase catalytic activity, which was markedly diminished by the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, indicating a key role for caspases in executing GA-DM-treated melanoma. Further mechanistic investigations of melanoma cell death revealed that GA-DM treatment induced the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax with a marked suppression of pro-survival protein survivin, and destabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential. Analysis of cytoplasmic fractions of treated cells detected remarkable elevation of apoptotic protein Apaf-1, which also co-localized with cytochrome c in melanoma cells, suggesting the involvement of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway where cellular insult starts by the migration of Bax to the surface of the mitochondria that subsequently inhibit the protective effects of Bcl-2, and mediates the release of cytochrome c as suggested previously [41] . Cytochrome c then complexes with Apaf-1, forming the apoptosome, to activate caspase 9, triggering the effector caspase cascade and leading to an induction of apoptosis in melanoma cells as described [42] . Annexin V staining of treated melanoma cells supported this notion because a significant portion of GA-DM-treated cells were undergoing apoptosis, which included both early and late apoptotic events.",

Timedependent cell death of treated melanoma suggests an apparent role of GA-DM in promoting a toxic form of autophagy that possibly contributes to an activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Protein analysis of melanoma cells showed early events (3 to 6 h, following GA-DM treatment) featuring significant upregulation of autophagy regulatory proteins Beclin-1 and LC-3. Yet, autophagic markers, especially Beclin-1, are drastically reduced at a later time point (12-24 h) , suggesting a shift to apoptosis. Autophagy protein Beclin-1 has long been identified as a Bcl-2-interacting partner [37, 43, 44] . Thus, our data suggest that an early increase of Beclin-1 in treated melanoma cells may contribute to the interplay of apoptotic and survival proteins, deactivating mitochondrial protection and triggering intrinsic apoptotic events.",

            "text": "Although, current chemotherapy for melanoma has shown a high success rate at early stage disease, it has failed to relieve those suffering from late stage metastatic disease [6, 45, 46] . Thus, treatment strategies have been adopted to combine chemotherapy with immunotherapy, to destroy the cancer cells as well as elevate antitumor immunity to prevent further re-occurrence [4] . Unfortunately, in many clinical trials, immunotherapy did not prove advantageous over current chemotherapy strategies, suggesting prominent defects in tumor cell-expressed immune components, a pre-requisite for T cell stimulation via the cellmediated immune pathway. Thus, an agent that could enhance tumor immunogenicity while reducing tumor burden would be an ideal chemo-immunotherapeutic to overcome major constraints bound to melanoma treatment. A key aspect of this immune response to tumor cells was observed in amplification of HLA class II-mediated antigen presentation to T cells [16, 28, 47] . Our data clearly showed that GA-DM treatment is capable of augmenting the HLA-class II pathway of immune recognition. An increase level of Lamp-2 by GA-DM may also complement CD4+ T cell recognition via the endolysosomal class II pathway. Blocking autophagy may reduce immune recognition of tumor cells, while suboptimal killing of tumors may enhance immune recognition via the HLA class II pathway. Despite the fact that doses of GA-DM (40 \u03bcM or higher) induce >50% cytotoxicity in J3 melanoma cells after 12 h of treatment, the few remaining viable cells are able to present antigen and stimulate CD4+ T cells. Evidently, lower concentrations of GA-DM showed a much stronger effect in inducing immune response, where surviving cells were capable of processing whole antigens for presentation to T cells. The antitumor effects of GA-DM such as slower growth and host T cell infiltration in tumor mass were also observed in vivo in the B16 mouse melanoma model, suggesting the potential of GA-DM as a complementary chemotherapeutic against malignant tumors. Future studies are underway to determine the molecular mechanisms of the in vivo therapeutic effects of GA-DM treatment, but our current findings suggest an enormous potential of GA-DM as a chemo-immunotherapeutic agent for treating malignant diseases.",
