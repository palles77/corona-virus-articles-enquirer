Methods: We studied were 180 VLBW preterm infants who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of CHA Gangnam Hospital from January of 2006 to December of 2009. The subjects were divided into 2 groups: an NEC group (greater than stage II on the modified Bell's criteria) and a control group (less than stage II on the modified Bell's critieria). We defined red blood cell transfusion before NEC diagnosis as the frequency of transfusion until NEC diagnosis (mean day at NEC diagnosis, day 18) in the NEC group and the frequency of transfusion until 18 days after birth in the control group. Results: Of the 180 subjects, 18 (10%) belonged to the NEC group, and 14 (78%) of these 18 patients had a history of transfusion before NEC diagnosis. The NEC group received 3.1\u00b12.9 transfusions, and the control group received 1.0\u00b11.1 transfusions before the NEC diagnosis (P=0.005). In a multi variate logistic regression corrected for gestational age, Apgar score at 1 minute, the presence of respiratory distress syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, premature rupture of membrane, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and death were confounding factors. The risk of NEC increased 1.63 times (95% confidence interval, 1.145 to 2.305; P=0.007) with transfusion before the NEC diagnosis. Conclusion: The risk for NEC increased significantly with increased transfusion frequency before the NEC diagnosis.",

            "text": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an emergency gastrointestinal disease in neonates due to mucosal or transmural necrosis of the bowel. About 7% to 13% of all very low birth weight (VLBW) infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) develop NEC, with a mortality range of 10% to 44% [1] [2] [3] , and both the incidence and mor tality rate increase with decreasing birth weight and gestational age (GA). Intestine immaturity, birth asphyxia, low appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (Apgar) score, intestinal ischemic change due to umbilical artery catheterization, viruses (rotavirus, coronavirus, and en tero virus), infection from coagulase-negative Staphylococcus or Clostridium difficile, and early rapid feeding are cause of NEC [4] [5] [6] . Some reports have indicated an association between red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (RBC(t)) and NEC, but this is controversial [7] [8] [9] [10] . In this study, we analyzed the association between NEC and RBC(t) in VLBW preterm infants.",

Infants with stage II or greater were defined as the NEC group and those less than stage II and without NEC patients were defined as the control group. We defined that RBC(t) before NEC diagnosis as the frequency of transfusion until the NEC diagnosis (mean day at NEC diagnosis, day 18) in NEC group. Therefore, the frequency of transfusion was counted until 18 days after birth in control group. We evaluated patient history, including GA, birth weight (B.wt), Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes, hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct) at birth, the time from premature rupture of membrane (PROM), the use of prenatal antibiotics, intraventicular hemorrhage (IVH\u2265grade 2: identified and classi fied by sonographic features), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), hemorrhage history at other sites (pulmonary hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and petechia), the presence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and the number of times surfactant was used, presence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), dose of indomethacin admini stration, time on ventilator and O 2 and the presence of bron chopulmonary dysplasia. We investigated the NEC stage and the frequency of packed RBC(t) during the hospital course and transfusions before the NEC diagnosis for the patients with a NEC diagnosis. The decision for RBC(t) was made by the neonatologist caring for the infant and transfusion guidelines 11) were followed. All transfusions were done with packed RBCs. Packed RBCs were transfused in a volume of 10 to 20 mL/kg over 2 to 4 hours.",

The incidence of IVH and PDA tended to be more frequent in the NEC group than that in the control group. But there were no significant statistical difference. A total of 3.1\u00b12.9 transfusions were administered in the NEC group before the NEC diagnosis with 6.2\u00b15.8 transfusions administered in the NEC group during the entire hospital course. This number of transfusions before NEC diagnosis was significantly larger than that in the control group (1.0\u00b11.1 times) ( Table 1) .

Higher PDA incidences also tended to increase NEC risk, but the difference was not significant.

The number of transfusions was significantly different be tween our two groups and the adjusted multivariate logistic regression revealed that the NEC risk increased 1.297 times (95% CI, 1.097 to 1.533; P=0.002) with an increase in the number of transfusions. There are several biologically plausible reasons why packed RBC(t) may lead to NEC, including a decrease in nitric oxide in stored RBCs and an exaggerated intestinal immune response to packed RBC(t) 9) . In contrast to our study, Josephson et al 10) . reported that RBC(t) had no temporal re lationship to NEC and stated that is only meaningful as it indi cates the infant's general condition.",
