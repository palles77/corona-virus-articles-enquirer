Such effects were evident in HCV-229E-infected controls pretreated with normal serum, but not in mock-infected controls.

RBS and WMI5 both blocked enzyme activity and virus infection, but failed to bind to hAPN mut -3T3 cells (Table 1) . By contrast, although MY7 also inhibited HCV-229E infection, it only partially inhibited enzyme activity and recognized the mutant hAPN glycoprotein. Infection of W138 cells by HCV-229E was not prevented by either actinonin or bestatin, small inhibitory molecules that bind competitively to the active site of hAPN I9 -21 . By contrast, HCV-229E infection was inhibited by 1,10phenanthroline and 2,2' -dipyridyl, which block aminopeptidase N activity by cheiating the zinc required by enzymatically active hAPN molecuJes ls . These chelators may alter the conformation We have shown that human coronavirus HCV-229E uses human aminopeptidase N as a receptor and that antibodies directed against the active site of this enzyme prevent virus infection of human cells. A serologically unrelated human respiratory corona virus, HCY-OC43, does not use hAPN as a receptor, and its receptor is unknown. HCV-OC43 is related to murine coronavirus MHV-A59, whose receptor 22 -24 is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family of glycoproteins in the immunoglobulin superfamily. Thus, two related coronaviruses, HCY-229E and TGEY, use aminopeptidase N glycoproteins of their normal host species as receptors, whereas two coronaviruses in a different serogroup do not use this aminopeptidase as their receptors. Possibly, coronaviruses related to HCY-229E, such as canine or feline coronaviruses, also use as receptors aminopeptidase or related metalloproteases, such as aminopeptidase A (refs 25, 26) or neutral endopeptidase 26 -3o \u2022 Because of their abundance at the apical surfaces of epithelial cells in the alimentary and respiratory tracts, these metalloproteases are promlsmg candidates for receptors of other groups of mammalian viruses or for bacteria or fungi. 0",
