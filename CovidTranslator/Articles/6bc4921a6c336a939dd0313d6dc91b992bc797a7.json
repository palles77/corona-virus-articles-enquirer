Methods The studied subjects were divided into two groups. Sixty-two post-SARS patients with osteonecrosis were one group, and 52 age-and sex-matched healthy people were as normal controlled group. Empty stomach blood samples from cubital veins were collected from both groups. Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction and solid phase oligonucleotide assay.",

The films were evaluated by qualified radiologists and orthopedists, respectively, and an agreement for the final diagnosis may be obtained by a cooperative discussion for the films resulting in discrepant opinions from the two independent professionals. A total of 61 patients identified with ON (25 men, 36 women) and aged 30.4 years (20-60 years) were included as the study population in the present study. The following baseline parameters were obtained for these patients: mean received corticosteroid 7,706.4 mg (1,200-30,000 mg), mean daily maximal dosage of corticosteroid 373.2 mg (80-1,020 mg), mean duration of the corticosteroid medication 40.8 days (14-105 days) and mean duration of pulse therapy with corticosteroid ([80 mg/day) 30.1 days (9-67 days).

The intravascular coagulation-induced thrombosis in the subchondral microcirculation may result in intraosseous hypertension, reduced blood stream and osteocytic ischemia/hypoxia, consequently leading to the necrosis of bone cells. This theory was further supported by the study conducted by Starklint et al. [15] , who found fibrin thrombi in the area with ON. Hyper-coagulable/hypo-fibrinolytic status can be inherent or acquired. As a result of excessive corticosteroid administration, patients with SARS may develop such hyper-coagulable/hypo-fibrinolytic status, attributable to the intraosseous thrombosis and resulted ON. Therapy with corticosteroid may provide for the recipients a prethrombotic stage which is a pathological state that may contribute to the thrombosis. In patients with previously existed hyper-coagulable/hypo-fibrinolytic status, corticosteroid therapy may be more risky in the formation of ON. This is called as second hit theory for ON [16, 17] . Fibrinolysis system comprises a series of actors, substrates, activators and inhibitors that participate in the conversion from plasminogen to active fibrinogenase and the subsequent action on the fibrin. The fibrinolysis is indeed a chain reaction catalyzed by a group of proteins, mainly functioning to immediately lyze the fibrin clot created locally and temporally to prevent from thrombosis. Among these factors, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), a member of serine proteinase inhibitors, mainly takes effect via the deactivation of the tissue plasminogen activator and presents with an increased activity in hyper-coagulable and thrombotic diseases. The correlation between fibrinolytic disorders and ON has been confirmed in many publications. Similar to the study by Glueck et al. [18, 19] in which the correlation between PAI and ON was established, this study reported that PAI increased in the patients with post-SARS ON.",

            "text": "Human PAI-1 gene is located at Chromosome 7q21.3*q22, containing 9 exons and 8 introns. Recent studies revealed that a 4G/5G polymorphism may be generated by inserting a guanosine (G) at the 675 bp upstream the transcription initiating site of the promoter region of PAI-1. As seen in clinically observational studies, 4G/5G polymorphism may be closely related to the plasma PAI-1 activity as allele G4 may be associated with an increased plasma PAI-1 level. In Glueck's series [20] , 24 of 59 patients with ON (41 %) were identified as 4G/4G homozygote versus the controls (20 %), so that he considered the PAI polymorphism may be the causative factor of the ON. Paolo et al. [21] performed a determination to the PAI-1 gene in patients with ON developed posterior to the renal transplantation and revealed that the presence of 4G/4G was more frequent to see in this patient group than in the patients absent of ON, thus concluding that genotype 4G/4G can serve as a indictor for the ON posterior to the renal transplantation. Moreover, as reported by Asano et al. [22] , a discrepancy between the races may be observed in this aspect since no correlation was found between PAI-1 gene polymorphism and Japanese with postrenal transplantation ON.",

In the present study, the plasma PAI level was higher in patients with genotype 4G/4G than those with the other two genotypes, suggesting the correlation between the increased PAI level in ON and the genotype 4G/4G. This indicated that PAI may be a potential biomarker used for the screening of the predisposing factor of ON and that PAI genotype 4G/4G may be the genetic marker for ON in Chinese patients. In conclusion, PAI and PAI-1 genotype 4G/4G deserve an important value in the screening for the population highly susceptible to non-traumatic ON.
