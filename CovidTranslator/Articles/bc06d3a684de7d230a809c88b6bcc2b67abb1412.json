STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of 111 infants born o29 weeks GA, controlling for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) severity and assessing pulmonary health over the first year of life through oxygen, diuretic and inhaled steroid use. RESULT: Regression analysis showed viral infections increased oxygen use (odds ratio (OR) of 15.5 (confidence interval (CI) \u00bc 3.4, 71.3)). The trend test showed increasing numbers of viral infections were associated with increased oxygen (OR (95% CI) \u00bc 6.4 (2.3 to 17.4), P \u00bc 0.0003), diuretic (OR (95% CI) \u00bc 2.4 (1.1to 5.2), P \u00bc 0.02) and inhaled steroid use (OR (95% CI) \u00bc 2.2 (1.003 to 5.2), P \u00bc 0.049), whereas bacterial infections were not. CONCLUSION: Viral infections caused more long-term pulmonary morbidity/mortality than bacterial infections on premature lung health, even when controlling for BPD.",

            "text": "One in eight infants is born prematurely in the United States annually, costing B$26.2 billion dollars a year ($51 600 per infant) on their medical care. 1, 2 Infants born in the United States o28 weeks gestational age (GA) now have a 90% survival rate 3 with chronic respiratory morbidity as the most common and costly adverse outcome for these infants. [4] [5] [6] Premature infants' altered lung development places them at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in the first year of life. BPD is now characterized by less inflammation and fibrosis of the airways but with structural abnormalities. 6, 7 A total of 77% of infants born o30 weeks GA develop BPD. 4 Some of these infants manifest early mild respiratory problems that deteriorate over the first year of life. 6 These pulmonary abnormalities are not always associated with the infants' severity of BPD around 36 weeks GA or respiratory support in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). 8 Intercurrent respiratory infections in this group have been associated with increased morbidity and premature infants have a 73% chance of readmission to the hospital for respiratory infections in the first 2 years of life. 9 Respiratory syncyntial virus is the most common cause for readmission; 10 however, rhinovirus, the most common viral pathogen in childhood, can also cause severe respiratory infections in premature infants. [11] [12] [13] The primary structural and functional problems in BPD, in combination with intercurrent respiratory infections, may be creating the conditions for morbidity and death among infants who appeared to be developing successfully. Infants with milder BPD may be at risk for increased hospitalization over time from respiratory complications. The exact cause of this increased morbidity is unclear. 6 The objective of this study was to evaluate the additional impact of intercurrent bacterial and/or viral respiratory infections on a cohort of extremely premature infants' pulmonary health over the first year of life past NICU discharge regardless of rehospitalization status.",

We demonstrated that viral infections had a significantly greater impact compared with bacterial infections by evaluating commonly used therapies for chronic lung disease of infancy in the outpatient setting: oxygen use, diuretic use and inhaled steroid use.

BPD lung structure consists of a simplified alveolar architecture 7,14 with less alveolar area for ventilation as well as a decreased intravascular pulmonary network that affects the perfusion to the lung. [15] [16] [17] In the short term, this leads to less baseline pulmonary reserve, which is further compromised by infection-mediated inflammation. Viral infections have been shown to remain in lung tissue for over a month after the acute infection has resolved, causing prolonged abnormal inflammatory responses. 18, 19 Viral infections have also been linked to the development of airway hyper reactivity and asthma in later life, 20 which further demonstrates the long-lasting impact of viral infections on the pulmonary physiology. As viruses persist in the lung longer than bacteria, it is not surprising that our cohort had worse pulmonary outcomes at 1 year with a history of viral as opposed to bacterial intercurrent lung infections. Recent animal studies have indicated that supplemental oxygen increases an animal's sensitivity to influenza infection through altered inflammatory pathways, 21 which adds biologic plausibility to our clinical findings linking greater lung morbidity in premature infants at a year of age who have had intercurrent viral infections.",

All of these infants were from one center and our findings may not be generalizable to the population at large; however, comparison with one national database did show similar outcomes for BPD severity. 22 Also, obtaining long-term data on extremely preterm infants can be challenging, especially for infants who are born 4160 km from the admitting NICU center. Therefore, some infants were LFU after hospital discharge. Some of these infants could have moved out of state and died in another center or have significant pulmonary morbidity that was being managed at another location. Another limitation was our definition of infections. Although the patients were in the NICU, we had better control over management; once the patients were in the community, the type of work-up they obtained varied and did not always include the same supporting laboratory/radiographic studies. We identified one no/mild BPD, one moderate BPD and three severe BPD cases that relied on documented radiographic, laboratory and clinical exam findings to diagnose the viral upper respiratory tract infection but no actual virus was isolated on viral studies. Two no/mild, three moderate and one severe BPD case did not have confirmation on how the viral upper respiratory tract infection was diagnosed. During this time period, the extended viral PCR panel (Biofire FilmArray RP), which now includes an extended number of viral pathogens including Coronavirus 229E, Coronavirus HKU1, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus OC43, Influenza A subtype H1-2009, Parainfluenza virus 4, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumonia and Impact of respiratory infections on premature lung health JB Taylor et al Mycoplasma pneumoniae, was not commonly being used in our center or the community. Once discharged from the NICU, the infants were not evaluated on a daily basis by a physician and it is likely that minor infections, both bacterial/viral, went unnoticed by caregivers. Also, our center followed the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation for Synagis administration. It was given 48 to 72 h before discharge between the months of November and March. Out of 157 patients, 51 were discharged within this timeframe and all received their initial Synagis dose inhouse; however, subsequent doses were provided to their local pediatricians so compliance data are not available for this cohort.",

Locally, we were consistent with our initiation of therapy and weaning protocols; however, this will not be the case if data from multi-center national databases are used, this further highlights the need for ongoing research into this area of clinical management for this population. There were several strengths in our study design. We evaluated infants born recently (2008 to 2010) and had been hospitalized within the same hospital within 24 h of birth. This study design minimized the variability of ventilatory strategies used on this cohort as they were managed by the same group of physicians incorporating the goal of quick transition from invasive to noninvasive ventilatory support. 22 As our cohort was born recently and spans only 3 years, the impact of changing technology and medical therapies over time was minimized. Our study also required access to medical records for this cohort past hospital discharge with special interest being placed on ER, hospital and primary care provider records. As this center is the only tertiary referral center for children with complex illness in this geographic region, we hospitalize over 86% of pediatric cases (unpublished CMH demographic data) and closer to 100% of high-risk cases. A multispecialty clinic follows the NICU graduates closely over the first few years of life with close coordination/communication with the outside pediatrician. This makes it less likely that an episode of illness requiring health-care utilization was missed. The NICU clinic sees the patients every 1 to 3 months for at least a year post NICU discharge and the CMH-DR has permission to collect information on participants up to 5 years post NICU discharge. Only 13% (19/ 142) of the cohort were LFU and 78% (111/142) of participants were successfully followed through their first year of life (82% if deaths were excluded (111/136)).",

Several strategies on home oxygen therapy and weaning protocols have been proposed; 22-25 however, there still remains a wide variability in practice in the pediatric providers. 26 Even the efficacy of reducing health-care expenditures in this patient population with outpatient pulmonary follow-up is unclear. However, recent literature has shown that pulmonary follow-up keeps the ER visits and hospitalization rates between mild and severe BPD patients stable 27 when normally more severe BPD patients have increased sequelae. Previous recommendations for evaluation of sleep disordered breathing in this population was focused on infants with severe BPD; however, recent studies have shown that daytime oxygen saturations and respiratory rates did not predict instability seen on sleep studies. 28 Recent studies performing serial infant pulmonary function tests did not demonstrate any 'catch up' lung growth in the BPD infants in the first year of life. 29, 30 Studies in teenagers/ adults with a history of BPD showed persistent abnormalities in lung function as seen by increased air trapping, increased residual volume, increased incidence of airway hyper reactivity and a faster decline in lung function in adulthood compared with controls. [31] [32] [33] Our study suggests that a wider range of extremely premature infants, even those with no/mild BPD, may be at risk of significant pulmonary sequelae from intercurrent infections based on this increased use of oxygen over the first year of life.",
