The disease was first reported in China in 1976 [6] , caused serious economic losses due to the death of neonatal piglets and weight loss of the infected pigs. Clinical signs of PED include anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. Morbidity and mortality in infected neonatal piglets less than 5 days old approach 100% because of severe diarrhea and dehydration. However, mortality in infected piglets older than 10 days is less than 10% [1] .",
