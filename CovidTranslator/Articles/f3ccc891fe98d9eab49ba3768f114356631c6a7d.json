            "text": "The 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea was a serious threat to public health, and was exacerbated by the inappropriate responses of major institutions and the public. This study examined the sources of confusion during the MERS outbreak and identified the factors that can affect people's behavior. Methods: An online survey of the risk perception of university students in South Korea was performed after the epidemic had peaked. The questionnaire addressed the major social determinants in South Korea during the MERS epidemic. The analysis included data from 1,470 subjects who provided complete answers. Results: The students had 53.5% of the essential knowledge about MERS. Women showed higher risk perception than men, and trust in the media was positively associated with risk perception (P < .001). Additionally, risk perception was positively associated with overreaction by the public (odds ratio, 2.80; 95% confidence interval, 2.17-3.60; P < .001). These findings suggest that media content affected the public's perception of MERS risk and that perception of a high level of risk led to overreaction. Conclusions: Risk perception was associated with most of the social factors examined and overreaction by the public. Therefore, providing accurate information and data to the public, establishing trust, and facilitating the development of an attitude will all be important in future crises.",

During the MERS outbreak, 38 died and 16,752 had been quarantined (Fig 1) . 1 The case fatality rate of MERS in South Korea was approximately 20.4%, lower than that on the Arabian Peninsula (approximately 45%). 2 Public apprehension was exacerbated because the government did not disclose timely information about the status of the epidemic or hospitals' names and procedures related to MERS infection. Therefore, the public were unaware of the appropriate actions to take, but were provided with relevant information by the media.",

Nevertheless, the Chinese government assigned responsibility for censorship of the media, including the Internet, to local agencies. 5 In the new media age, in which social media (including the Internet, short message services, and mobile applications) are centralized, the government restricts freedom of expression in the same way as it has restricted such freedom among traditional media sources, such as newspapers, radio, and television. 6 The control of the acquisition of information is more difficult in this new age because social media are tools not only for the dissemination, sharing, and seeking of health information but also for the expression of feelings and the sharing of personal experiences and opinions. 7, 8 Therefore, organizations need to build effective communication tools to respond to emerging infectious disease (EID) outbreaks because the public may express scientific skepticism about scientific topics and participation in decision-making. 9 During epidemics, people usually require guidance on how to behave from a trusted source. The government and public institutions are the ideal sources because people tend to rely on the national administration. For this reason, trust in these institutions plays a main role in the public's acceptance of policies and actions. 10 The World Health Organization suggested that outbreak communication should incorporate the following 5 key factors: (1) building, maintaining, or restoring trust; (2) announcing early; (3) maintaining transparency; (4) understanding the public; and (5) planning of all aspects of the response to an outbreak. 11 Therefore, risk communication enhances the decision-making ability of laypeople, and can be examined by assessing risk perception. 12 Trust in not only the government and public agencies but also in the media and other institutions may be associated with risk perception. Therefore, the instigation of fear among the public by the media may contribute to social panic, particularly in emergency situations.",

            "text": "The term risk perception usually refers to individuals' judgments about and evaluations of hazards to which they might be exposed. 13 Therefore, risk perception might be among the social phenomena related to exposure to the risk of disease. In addition, perceived risk influences health behavior both positively and negatively. 14 During the MERS outbreak in South Korea, negative behaviors were observed, such as oversensitive or inappropriate reactions. Some children of health care workers at hospitals treating MERS patients were prevented from attending school. Meanwhile, self-quarantined subjects occasionally escaped out of their homes until the level of infection subsided. These reactions of citizens reflect distrust in the government and accelerated noncompliance with the directions provided by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This finding is important because overreaction is an indicator of the level of trust in the government among the public and may provoke another social problem related to moral panic. 15 Fear causing the behaviors described previously mentioned is likely related to risk perception and a low level of trust in the government and society. However, because risk perception may be related to a number of unknown determinants, it is important to identify factors that may affect risk perception. Sj\u00f6berg examined risk perception using several approaches, 16 and reported that 30%-40% of risk perception could be explained by risk sensitivity, attitude, and a specific fear model. In other models, <20% of risk perception was explained. There were also some studies regarding risk perception. Previous studies of risk perception related to nuclear explosions and infectious diseases addressed the relationship between perceived risk and various social predictors, such as knowledge, social trust, and attitude. 17, 18 However, previous literature on the determinants of risk perception has been limited.",

Therefore, this section assessed the following personal characteristics: degree of optimism about the health policies of South Korea, willingness to sacrifice for society, responsiveness to an emergency situation, and attitude toward self-quarantine and overreaction. Attitude toward self-quarantine was measured with a question asking whether respondents were willing to prioritize quarantine adherence above all personal needs (responses were categorized as yes and no). The overreaction section comprised the following 2 questions: (1) How would you react if you realized your children were in the same class as those of someone suspected (or confirmed) to have MERS (including school and extracurricular activities)?; and (2) How would you react if you realized your children were in the same class as those of medical workers at hospitals with MERS patients (including school and extracurricular activities)? The responses to the formerly involved overreactions, for example, \"(Do not) Allow my relatives or children of my family to attend school,\" and those to the latter were the opposite, such as \"I think children of medical workers at hospitals with MERS patients should (not) be allowed to attend school.\" Each question was assumed to indicate overreaction to the behavior of oneself and others.",

To assess the associations of demographic factors, knowledge, trust in social organizations, intention to sacrifice, and responsiveness to emergency situations with risk perception, multiple linear regression analyses were used. Each question regarding risk perception was aggregated to produce a cumulative score indicative of the overall effect of risk perception. Prior to analysis, the variables were tested using a Q-Q plot to verify the normality of their distribution andwith the exception of knowledge-were confirmed to be continuous because the ordinal values differed only slightly from a normal distribution. 24 Risk perception was estimated on a scale of 1-7, and its relationship with predictors was assessed. In addition, to identify the association of risk perception with overreaction to the epidemic and compliance with self-quarantine, multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for self-quarantine and overreaction. Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).",

Women and those with low levels of trust in central government, the medical field, and health policy were more likely to overreact. On the other hand, people with high levels of trust in the media, local government, and NGOs may be hypersensitive when an EID outbreak occurs. Furthermore, the higher risk perception was associated with only overreaction, not compliance to self-quarantine. Hypersensitivity that leads to overreaction can be explained by perceived media dependency 26 ; however, this may have been related only to television in this research. Moreover, differences in the effects of trust in central and local governments on risk perception may be explained by South Koreans' perceptions of the roles of these government bodies. Central and local governments do not always appear to smoothly coordinate the emergency response, and this may be related to ongoing challenges about decentralization from the central governmental system. 27 Another important finding is related to the role of the media during a crisis. In this study, trust in the media positively affected risk perception and overreaction, supporting that the mass media influence perceptions of disasters and risks; however, they cannot change an epidemic event itself. 4 Restrictions on the availability of information by the government can exacerbate the impact of a disaster, especially in the new media age, in which person-centered media is emphasized; this was the case in the 2003 SARS outbreak in China and the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea. Regardless of the political system (ie, even in democratic states), the absence of risk communication may yield unexpected results.

For these reasons, the role of the mass media is particularly important because they usually provide widespread coverage of EIDs and convey information to the public. 30 Furthermore, the level of knowledge about MERS was not associated with risk perception. This is not in agreement with a previous report of a correlation between knowledge and perception of the risk of nuclear explosions. 31 Notwithstanding these considerations, knowledge of MERS was directly associated with overreaction and compliance with self-quarantine.

In addition, while responsiveness to an emergency was associated directly with overreaction and compliance with self-quarantine, willingness to sacrifice was associated only with compliance with self-quarantine. Personal characteristics were associated with responsive behaviors; however, the reasons for these associations could not be determined. One possibility is nationalism. Individuals who regard nations as abstract communities with shared emotional bonds governed by rules and/or norms tend to be altruistic. 32 Therefore, people in Table 5 Associations of risk perception, knowledge, and personal characteristics with overreaction in one's own behavior societies governed by established, systematic rules are less likely to exhibit unusual behaviors that may lead to social panic. Moreover, inaccurate information is disseminated through social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google. The enormous influence of social media during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa has led to exaggerated concerns even among the population in the United States with negligible risks. 33 Indeed, the mass media can also incite panic, which is related to fear and antisocial behavior 34 ; however, when they do their job properly, they can inform the public accurately about current conditions. Two studies in which a mobile health communication tool was used demonstrated the effectiveness of a social media-based approach in terms of changing vaccination behavior. 35, 36 Furthermore, the provision of appropriate and timely public health information by social media and the mobile health tool could accelerate the detection of disease outbreaks and enhance the public's response, 37 thereby minimizing adverse health and economic effects. 38 The findings of our study are depicted in schematic form in Figure 2 . In this model, risk perception was related to various factors such as sex, trust, and other personal characteristics. There was a notable aspect of risk perception: it was directly associated with overreaction, but not with compliance to self-quarantine. This suggests that risk perception motivates self-protective behavior, possibly resulting in overreaction. However, it does not automatically result in compliance to quarantine, which is generally perceived as protecting others, rather than oneself. In this sense, risk perception is a double-edged sword: at an optimal level, it helps the public protect themselves from infection and thereby deter the spread of epidemic; however, when excessive and characterized by fear, it can lead to other social problems, such as overreaction and discrimination. Sandman reported that risk perception is comprised of hazard and outrage. 39 The MERS outbreak caused fear and anxiety among the population, which might have resulted in an overreaction to both the response of the government and the behaviors of themselves and others. 40 Our model also points to the importance of trust in medical experts and proper knowledge. These 2 factors demonstrate the potential to maximize the benefit by promoting compliance and reducing overreaction. Therefore, risk communication should not just scare people, but should create a context in which there is trust and a flow of knowledge and clear information between the authorities and the public. These conditions should prevent adverse effects, particularly in democratic states. The existing literature emphasizes these essential components of risk management and risk communication. 41, 42 To date, there are a limited number of studies on risk perception of infectious diseases (including MERS); therefore, this work makes an important contribution to the field. Several factors affecting perceived risk were evaluated (eg, trust in the media or health policy, personal characteristics), which were not assessed in previous studies. Although knowledge and trust have been previously reported to be associated with perceived risk, 17, 18 this study further explored possible effects of risk perception and their implications in responding to an epidemic. EIDs are unfamiliar to the general public and are likely to be overestimated in the risk, 31 possibly leading to social panic. To prevent this, it is important to boost the risk communication with fostering trust and relevant knowledge, which requires transparency.",

First, the survey involved students at a university; therefore, the participants might have different levels of concern about the epidemic compared with the general public. However, the participants represented the younger population with a homogeneous educational level with fewer confounding factors. Therefore, the findings were still likely meaningful for understanding the characteristics of risk perception in the essence. Second, the response rate was rather low (4.8%). Most online surveys have much lower response rates than person-to-person interviews. 43 The students who had a greater perception of the risk might have been better motivated to participate in the study. Even if the associations found in this study may be weaker in a larger population, it is informative to identify the direction and structure of the interrelationships among the factors.",

Understanding the determinants of risk perception contributes to effective communication. Building trust and sharing knowledge are important to ensure a rapid response to disease outbreaks, and to prevent unnecessary behaviors among members of the public.",
