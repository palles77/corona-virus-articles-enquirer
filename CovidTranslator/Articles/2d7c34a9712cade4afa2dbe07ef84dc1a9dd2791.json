            "text": "Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller) is the most widely used species, both commercially and for its therapeutic properties (Cardarelli et al., 2017; Kojo and Qian, 2004; Chen et al., 2012) . This plant contains two materials with a juicy consistency: the first, a yellow exudate containing a high concentration of anthraquinone-type compounds, which have been used for decades as cathartics and purgatives, and the second, a clear mucilaginous gel that has been used since ancient times for the treatment of burns and other wounds (Fox et al., 2017; Reynolds and Dweck, 1999) . Among the chemical components of the exudate are aloin, emodin, aloe-emodin, barbaloin, isobarbaloin and chrysophanic acid. These compounds have been shown to possess antibacterial, fungicidal, diuretic, laxative, antiviral, hepatoprotective and vasorelaxant activities (Salah et al., 2017; Drudi et al., 2018) . The gel is highly rich in polysaccharides which are responsible of the immunostimulant and anti-inflammatory properties of the gel. Just over 200 different types of molecules have been isolated from this species, of which more than 75 different active compounds have been identified (Hamman, 2008; Reynolds, 1985) . In southeast Mexico, the production of aloe leaves covers an area of approximately 222 ha (SIAP, 2015) . Locally, the commercialization of aloe products is based on the concentrated gel from the leaves for the cosmetic industry. Some producers also commercialize the aloin obtained from the leave exudate for the pharmaceutical industry. In both processes, a high content of solid and agricultural residues is generated. The roots are not used locally as raw materials, but they are raising pharmaceutical interest because of their quinone content. Despite their many pharmacological activities and the available material, only aloe-emodin, emodin, and chrysophanic acid has been tested against influenza A virus (IAV) (Li et al., 2014) .",

Infection with this virus cause respiratory disease in humans and animals with high morbidity and mortality rates (Iglesias et al., 2011; Naesens et al., 2016) . Vaccination prevents influenza virus infection and antiviral drugs are used to treat infected patients; however, both are hampered by high variability of IAV surface glycoproteins (NA and HA mainly) and the emergence of resistant strains (Burnham et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015; McKimm-Breschkin, 2013) . Considering the broad pharmacological activities of A. vera quinones, the aim of this study was to investigate the antiviral activity of aloesaponarin-I, aloesaponarin-II, and their derivatives against influenza A virus.

Powdered roots (2.65 kg) were extracted three times with cold MeOH at room temperature for 72 h (1 L MeOH for each 500 g of dried material) (Fig. 1) . The extracts were combined, and the solvent was removed under pressure to produce 326 g of crude methanolic extract. Then, 201 g of the extract were suspended in a 1:1 mixture of water/MeOH (ca. 150 mL of solution/ 20 g of crude methanolic extract), and the resulting suspension was partitioned with EtOAc to yield a medium polarity extract (37.37 g). Successive flash chromatography using a gradient elution with mixtures of n-hexane/ AcOEt/MeOH and n-hexane/acetone of 2.23 g of AcOEt extract resulted in the isolation of metabolites 1 (112 mg) and 2 (20 mg) in pure form.

Additionally, a tetra-O-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl derivative from 2 and penta-acetyl glucose were also prepared. Briefly, for the methylation reaction, a mixture of 1 (50 mg, 0.16 mmol), CH 3 I (1 ml) and K 2 CO 3 (55 mg) in 10 mL of acetone was left to stir at room temperature for 72 h and then diluted with 30 mL of water. The resulting solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 30 mL). After the evaporation of the solvent, 43.22 mg (86.44% yield) of compound 3 were obtained as orange needles. For the acetylation reaction, a mixture of 1 (26.50 mg, 0.08 mmol), acetic anhydride (1 mL) and pyridine (0.50 mL) was allowed to stir overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was poured over water (50 mL), and the resulting suspension was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 times 1:1). The organic layer was washed (1:1, v:v) successively with water, 5% HCl, 5% NaHCO 3 , and a NaCl saturated solution. The treatment of the solvent with anhydrous Na 2 SO4 followed by filtration and evaporation yielded 21 mg (62.50% yield) of pure compound 4. Finally, for the preparation of O-glucosyacetyl and O-glucosyl derivatives, we employed phase-transfer reactions following the general procedure reported by Halazy et al. (1990) . Briefly, in a hermetically sealed container containing tetrabutylammonium bromide, a solution of the natural compound in anhydrous CH 2 Cl 2 was added, and it was stirred for a minute. Then, a 5% v / v NaOH solution was added, and the mixture was allowed to stir for 3 min until a colour change occurred. Then, distilled water was added. Subsequently, a solution of acetobromo-\u03b1-D-glucose in anhydrous CH 2 Cl 2 was added. The volume was adjusted with distilled water to a ratio of 1: 1 between the organic phase and the aqueous phase. The mixture remained under stirring at room temperature for 40 h. After the time period, the mixture was adjusted to pH 5 with a 5% v / v HCl solution. 50 mL of distilled water was added, and it was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 (3 \u00d7 40 mL), dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 and filtered. The solvent was evaporated to obtain O-glucosyacetyl derivatives. From 55.90 mg (0.17 mmol) of compound 1, 102.30 mg of O-glucosyacetyl compound 5 (88.95% yield) was obtained. Additionally, 25.60 mg (0.10 mmol) of compound 2 gave 27 mg of compound 7 (45.91%). To obtain O-glucosyl derivative 6, 26 mg (0.04 mmol) of compound 5 was dissolved in 22 mL of ethanol, and 1 mL of HCl was added. The mixture was stirred and warmed up to 70\u00b0C for 2 h under reflux. Once cooled, the solution was dried on a rotary evaporator. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography employing 100% EtOAc to yield 5.80 mg (30.21% yield) of derivative 6 as a yellow powder. NMR was employed for the chemical characterization of compounds 1-7.",

Compounds 3-4 were readily deduced through a comparison of their spectroscopic data ( 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR) with the spectroscopic data found in the literature (Lee et al., 2007; Yagui et al., 1974) , except for derivatives 5-7, which were new structures. Compound 5 and 7 were all obtained as intermediate compounds from the O-glucosyl reaction of 1 and 2. The 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR data, along with the molecular formula of compound 5, indicated a tetracyclic skeleton containing two aromatic rings corresponding to a anthraquinone-type compound. The 1 H NMR spectrum of 5 also showed the expected four sugar acetyl signals at \u03b4 2.04, 2.07, 2.10 and 2.18. The LC-HRMS spectra showed a single peak at a retention time of 7.75 min and a molecular ion peak at m/z value 642 (calcd for C 31 H 30 O 15 ). The 2 D NMR spectra allowed the complete characterization of derivative 5. Using all the previously mentioned data, compound 5 was elucidated to be 3-(2\u00b4,3\u00b4,4\u00b4,6\u00b4-tetra-O-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl)-Aloesaponarin I, a new derivative of 1. Compound 7 was isolated as yellow needles and showed similar 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR data as 5, except for the additional aromatic proton at \u03b47.14 (1H, d, J = 2.7 Hz) from the Aloesaponarin II anthraquinone structure. Consequently, compound 7 was determined to be new 3-(2\u00b4,3\u00b4,4\u00b4,6\u00b4-tetra-O-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl)aloesaponarin II. Derivative 6 was obtained as a yellow powder. The LC-HRMS spectra showed a single peak at a retention time of 3.50 min and a molecular ion peak at m/z value 474 (calcd for C 23 H 22 O 11 ). The IR spectrum had absorption bands at 3600 cm \u22121 (for hydroxyl groups), 1660 cm \u22121 (for conjugated carbonyl group), 1580 cm \u22121 (for aromatic rings) and 1730 cm \u22121 (for ester group). The 1 HNMR and 13 C NMR (CD 3 OD) spectra of 6 indicated the presence of an anthraquinone structure [\u03b4 7.31 (1H, dd, J = 1.2, 8.3 Hz, H-7); 7.69 (1H, t, J = 7.9 Hz, H-6); 7.74 (1H, dd, J = 1.2, 7.5 Hz, H-5); 7.97 (1H, s, H-4), having a \u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl anomeric proton at \u03b4 5.25 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-1\u00b4) in addition of an acetyl group (\u03b4 3.97 (3H, s, acetyl CH3-13) and one methyl proton (\u03b4 2.72 (3H, s, H-1). Furthermore, in the heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity (HMBC) experiment, long-range correlations were observed between the 1\u00b4-H proton and C3 carbon, confirming the sugar moiety on the aglycone. On the basis of this evidence, it was confirmed derivative 6 as a new aloesaponarin I derivative with a 3-O-\u03b2-Dglucopyranoside.",

The life cycle of the influenza virus lasts from 8 to 10 h and can be divided into three stages: a) viral entry (0-2 h), b) replication and translation of the viral genome (2-8 h) and c) release of the viral progeny (8-10 h). Each stage is a pharmacological target of inhibitory molecules. In this way, compounds 5 and 7 were added at 5 different times during viral infection. Based on the IC 50 values (IC 50 < 25 \u03bcM), both compounds were evaluated using the A/Yuc/2370/09 virus. As seen in Fig. 6 , both compounds decreased the viral production by 70% when added at 6-10 h post-infection. In the same manner, compound 7 reduced viral production of the A/InDRE/10 virus by 60% at the same period of time, 6-10 h. These results suggest that both compounds 5 and 7 inhibit viral production during virus infection.",

For the antiviral evaluation, several in vitro assays were performed based on indirect (CPE reduction assay) and direct (Plaque inhibition test, Time-of-addition experiments) methods. On the former, the ability of compounds to inhibit virus replication on MDCK cells was measured. On the latter, the ability of compounds to reduce viral titers was determined (Sidwell and Smee, 2000; Chattopadhyay et al., 2009) . The plaque reduction assay and time-of-addition results suggested that the antiviral activity of compounds 5 and 7 increases at the post-treatment level.",
