The best studied nidoviruses, the corona-and arteriviruses, employ a unique transcription mechanism, which involves discontinuous RNA synthesis, a process resembling similarityassisted copy-choice RNA recombination. During infection, multiple subgenomic (sg) mRNAs are transcribed from a mirror set of sg negative-strand RNA templates. The sg mRNAs all possess a short 5\u00a2 common leader sequence, derived from the 5\u00a2 end of the genomic RNA. The joining of the non-contiguous leader' and`body' sequences presumably occurs during minus-strand synthesis. To study whether toroviruses use a similar transcription mechanism, we characterized the 5\u00a2 termini of the genome and the four sg mRNAs of Berne virus (BEV). We show that BEV mRNAs 3\u00b15 lack a leader sequence. Surprisingly, however, RNA 2 does contain a leader, identical to the 5\u00a2-terminal 18 residues of the genome. Apparently, BEV combines discontinuous and nondiscontinous RNA synthesis to produce its sg mRNAs. Our \u00aendings have important implications for the understanding of the mechanism and evolution of nidovirus transcription.",

One recurring strategy, employed by many non-related viruses, entails the synthesis of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs (Miller and Koev, 2000) . While the genome invariably serves as the mRNA for the viral replicase, the sgRNAs mediate the expression of structural and accessory proteins from cistrons, downstream of the replicase gene. These sg mRNAs are always 3\u00a2-coterminal with the viral genome but, with regard to their synthesis, important differences exist among the various virus groups. For some viruses, e.g. brome mosaic virus (Miller et al., 1985) , transcription initiation of sg mRNAs occurs at internal promoter sequences on a genome-length, negative (\u00b1)-strand template. Alternatively, as proposed for red clover necrotic mosaic virus (Sit et al., 1998) and tomato bushy stunt virus (Choi et al., 2001) , sg (\u00b1)strand RNAs, resulting from premature transcription\u00b1termination, may serve as templates. The Nidovirales, pathogens of vertebrates and invertebrates, are unique among (+)strand RNA viruses: the best studied nidoviruses, i.e. the corona-and arteriviruses, employ an unusual transcription mechanism, involving discontinuous RNA synthesis.",

Downstream, there are multiple smaller genes, which are expressed from a nested set of up to eight sg mRNAs. In the case of the arteri-and coronaviruses, these sg mRNAs are chimeric and both 3\u00a2-and 5\u00a2-coterminal with the genome: they all possess a 5\u00a2 common leader sequence, which is derived from the 5\u00a2 terminus of the genomic RNA and fused to the`body' of the transcript (i.e. the 3\u00a2terminal part, which carries the coding information). Coronavirus leaders are 55\u00b192 nucleotides in length, whereas those of arteriviruses measure~200 nucleotides. The leader and mRNA body sequences are joined within a short conserved sequence motif, the transcription-regulating sequence (TRS), which precedes each transcription unit (van der Most and Spaan, 1995; de Vries et al., 1997; Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . A TRS is also found immediately downstream of the genomic leader sequence. Direct evidence that the TRSs are required for and determine the extent of sg mRNA synthesis was provided by mutagenesis studies (Makino et al., 1991; van der Most et al., 1994; van Marle et al., 1999) .",

            "text": "Although there is general agreement that corona-and arteriviral mRNA synthesis involves discontinuous transcription, the models for the actual mechanism are still subject to debate. Initially, it was proposed that fusion of non-contiguous sequences occurs during (+)strand synthesis. Leader molecules, including the TRS, would be transcribed from the 3\u00a2 end of a genome-sized, negativestrand RNA, anneal internally to complementary (anti-) TRS sequences on this (\u00b1)strand template, and thus act as primers for transcription of mRNA body sequences (Lai et al., 1982b; Baric et al., 1983 Baric et al., , 1985 Baric et al., , 1987 . The discovery of sg (\u00b1)strand RNAs (Sethna et al., 1989) , which carry anti-leader sequences (Sethna et al., 1991) and serve as templates for transcription (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990) , has led to an alternative model, in which discontinuous transcription takes place during minus-strand synthesis (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990 . This latter view is gaining increasing experimental support (Schaad and Baric, 1994; Chang et al., 1996; Krishnan et al., 1996; Baric and Yount, 2000; Sawicki et al., 2001) . In a series of elegant reverse genetics experiments, Snijder and co-workers (van Marle et al., 1999; Pasternak et al., 2000 Pasternak et al., , 2001 recently provided persuasive evidence that, in arteriviruses, leader\u00b1body fusion indeed occurs during the synthesis of (\u00b1)strand RNA, presumably via a process resembling similarity-assisted copy-choice RNA recombination. Template switching apparently is guided by base pairing between the anti-TRS on the nascent sg (\u00b1)strand and the 5\u00a2-most genomic TRS.",

During infection, a genome-sized, 27 992 nucleotide mRNA 1 is produced and, in addition, four sg mRNA species (numbered 2\u00b15) of 7, 2, 1.2 and 0.7 kb. The latter code for the spike protein (S), the membrane protein (M), a truncated hemagglutininesterase protein (HE) and the nucleocapsid protein (N), respectively (Figure 1; . The genes for M, HE and N are preceded by non-coding intergenic regions (IGRs), which contain the conserved sequence UCUUUAGA, the torovirus TRS equivalent. In contrast, the S gene overlaps with the replicase gene and there is no obvious TRS; a related motif, UGUUUAGU, was postulated to direct the synthesis of mRNA 2 (Snijder et al., 1990b,c) . Snijder et al. (1990c) characterized the 5\u00a2 end of BEV mRNA 5 by primer extension and hybridization analysis. A comparison with the putative 5\u00a2 end of the BEV genome, as deduced by sequence analysis of defective interfering (DI) RNAs, led the authors to conclude that torovirus mRNAs do not possess large common leader sequences. However, the existence of a small leader (e.g. comprising the conserved sequence and some upstream nucleotides) could not be excluded rigorously. In particular, comparative primer extension analysis of BEV genomic and DI RNAs yielded con\u00aficting results, raising doubts as to whether the DI sequences faithfully represented the 5\u00a2 terminus of the BEV genome .",

            "text": "Synthesis of BEV mRNA 2 (S) involves fusion of non-contiguous sequences Snijder et al. (1990b) previously proposed that the sequence UGUUUAG (residues 21 257\u00b121 263), which is located 50 nucleotides from the S initiation codon, represents the TRS of sg RNA 2. However, RLM-RACE ampli\u00aecation of the 5\u00a2-terminal sequences of RNA 2 with primer 1403 consistently yielded a 350 bp product ( Figure 3A ), suggesting that transcription initiation does not occur at the predicted site but some 150 nucleotides further upstream. Most surprisingly, the RLM-RACE product proved to be chimeric, comprising the 5\u00a2-most 15\u00b118 nucleotides of the genome fused to open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) sequences (Snijder et al., 1990a) , within the stretch G 21 133 \u00b1U 21 136 (Figures 5 and 7) . The chimeric product was not only found after RT\u00b1PCR with M-MuLV Superscript and Taq polymerase, but also under more stringent conditions with Thermus thermophilus (Tth) DNA polymerase, in one-tube reactions at temperatures b60\u00b0C. In accordance with the RLM-RACE data, primer extension analysis with oligonucleotide 1403 yielded one major run-off product of 303 nucleotides ( Figure 5) . A minor product of 314 nucleotides was also (1) and for sg mRNAs 2\u00b15 were separated in 2% agarose gels. (B) Puri\u00aecation of BEV genomic RNA. Tissue culture supernatant of BEV-infected Ederm cells was harvested and cleared by low speed centrifugation. Subsequently, virions were pelleted through a 10% (w/v) sucrose cushion. Genomic RNA was extracted and analyzed by RNA hybridization with oligonucleotide 294 (V); intracellular BEV mRNAs (IC) served as a marker. Fig. 2. (A) Immunoaf\u00aenity puri\u00aecation of BEV mRNAs with a cap-speci\u00aec mAb. Total cytoplasmic RNA extracted from BEV-infected cells was incubated with protein G\u00b1Sepharose beads, coupled with either the m 7 G-cross-reactive mAb H20 (aCap) or, as a negative control, the isotype-matched mAb R78 (aTcR). RNA, bound to the mAb-coupled beads, was eluted, separated in denaturing 1% agarose gels and hybridized to a radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe (294; Table I) observed, the 3\u00a2 end of which would map to U 21 108 . There is no TRS-like sequence present at this location; the 314 nucleotide cDNA may well have arisen from premature termination during reverse transcription of mRNA 1 or from mispriming. The combined results of RLM-RACE and primer extension analysis would suggest that: (i) the proposed promoter motif UGUUUAG does not direct transcription; (ii) mRNA 2 extends far into ORF1b, at least up to U 21 136 ; and (iii) perplexingly, mRNA 2 synthesis entails fusion of non-contiguous sequences.",

Most probably, however, toroviruses resemble the other nidoviruses in directing the synthesis of sg (\u00b1)strand templates (Sethna et al., 1989 (Sethna et al., , 1991 Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990; den Boon et al., 1996) .

            "text": "For discontinuous transcription in corona-and arteriviruses, current evidence supports a model in which (\u00b1)strand RNA synthesis is attenuated after copying a body TRS from the donor (+)strand template; pausing of the RdRp may be controlled by protein\u00b1TRS interaction and possibly local RNA secondary structure (Pasternak et al., 2000 (Pasternak et al., , 2001 . The nascent (\u00b1)strand, presumably while still in complex with the RdRp, then detaches and switches to the leader TRS at the 5\u00a2 end of the genome, which serves as the acceptor template. Upon anti-TRS\u00b1TRS duplex formation, transcription resumes and synthesis of a chimeric, anti-leader-containing sg (\u00b1)strand RNA is completed. We believe that an analogous similarity-assisted, copy-choice RNA recombination event during (\u00b1)strand synthesis would best explain the chimeric structure of BEV sg RNA 2. Inspection of the mRNA 2 fusion region in ORF1b revealed the presence of a 17 nucleotide sequence (A 21 118 \u00b1U 21 134 ), which can adopt a stem\u00b1loop structure (DG = \u00b18.6 kcal/mol). Strikingly, this hairpin loop immediately precedes the leader\u00b1body junction site, followed by a stretch of 24 residues, with remarkable identity (79%) to residues 15\u00b138 of the BEV genome ( Figure 8A ). Conceivably, this combination of sequence elements may create a recombinational hot spot, with the hairpin in the donor template causing attenuation of (\u00b1)strand synthesis and dissociation of the RdRp\u00b1RNA complex, after which the ORF1b-derived`guiding' sequence mediates a template switch by base pairing to its complementary sequence at the 5\u00a2 end of the viral genome ( Figure 8B ). Such a mechanism would not be without precedent. Studies on tombusvirus RNA recombination showed that the 3\u00a2 base of a stem\u00b1loop structure in the donor template is a preferred site for similarity-assisted template switching (White and Morris, 1995) . Torovirus discontinuous transcription would, however, differ from that of corona-and arteriviruses: the TRSs of the latter are not preceded by evident hairpins (A.O. Pasternak and E.J.Snijder, personal communication; R.J.de Groot, unpublished) .",

However, as in BEV, the region upstream of the PoTV S gene does not contain an evident promoter motif. In fact, it bears a strong resemblance to the corresponding BEV sequence, and the potential stem\u00b1loop structure is conserved. Most notably, as compared with the BEV element, there are two substitutions in the stem of the PoTV hairpin, but base pairing is maintained (C\u00b1G\u00aeU\u00b1A; Figure 8A ), reinforcing the notion that this RNA secondary structure may be relevant to discontintuous RNA 2 synthesis. Moreover, the similarities between BEV and PoTV suggest that the unusual combination of discontinuous and non-discontinuous transcription, displayed by BEV, does not result from tissue culture adaptation, but may also be employed by related naturally occurring toroviruses.",

It is commonly held that discontinuous transcription arose in a proto-nidovirus and that this mechanism was preserved in corona-and arteriviruses. This would imply that, in toroviruses, discontinuous transcription was replaced by a non-discontinuous transcription strategy for three of the four sg mRNAs, while in okaviruses, leader addition via discontinuous transcription was lost completely. However, it seems counterintuitive that a trait that survived the considerable evolutionary distance between The arrowhead indicates the mRNA 2 leader\u00b1body fusion site, comprising residues G 21 133 \u00b1U 21 136 (italicized). As illustrated schematically, the residues upstream of the fusion site can adopt a hairpin structure. Asterisks indicate residues identical between ORF1b and the 5\u00a2 terminus of the BEV genome. Shown below is a comparison of the corresponding regions in PoTV. At present, only a partial sequence of the 5\u00a2 end of the PoTV genome is available. (B) Schematic hypothetical model for the discontinuous synthesis of BEV mRNA 2 and for the non-discontinuous transcription of mRNAs 3\u00b15. For the latter RNAs, the TRSs on the (+)strand template (indicated in red) function as termination signals for (\u00b1)strand synthesis. The resulting sg (\u00b1)strands act in turn as templates for (+)strand sg RNA synthesis, with the anti-TRSs on the (\u00b1)strand template now functioning as transcription initiation signals. The viral RdRp is indicated as a gray circle. For the synthesis of mRNA 2, the stem\u00b1loop structure causes attenuation of (\u00b1)strand synthesis. Subsequently, a template switch occurs, during which the transcription complex is transferred to the 5\u00a2 end of the BEV genome, assisted by base pairing between ORF1b-derived sequences in the nascent (\u00b1) strand RNA and 5\u00a2-NTR sequences (indicated in blue). RNA synthesis resumes, resulting in the production of a transcriptioncompetent sg RNA species, carrying a non-contiguous, genome-derived anti-TRS.",

            "text": "Torovirus subgenomic RNA synthesis corona-and arteriviruses would have been lost during the radiation of the corona-, toro-and okaviruses, which seems to have occurred more recently (A.E.Gorbalenya, personal communication). We would therefore like to offer an alternative and equally plausible explanation, namely that the proto-nidovirus utilized an okavirus/ torovirus-like non-discontinuous transcription strategy and that discontinuous transcription arose independently in arteri-, corona-and toroviruses through convergent evolution. Indeed, there are remarkable differences between arteri-and coronaviruses with regard to the sizes of their leaders and TRSs. High frequency homologous RNA recombination appears to be a universal trait of nidoviruses (Brian and Spaan, 1997; Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Molenkamp et al., 2000) , which may have made them prone to developing analogous discontinuous transcription strategies. In arteri-and coronaviruses, the transcription initiation and termination signals, initially combined in the ancestral nidovirus TRS, may have become separated. In this view, leader addition would be re\u00aenement of a common nidoviral transcription scheme, in which the central phenomenon is not the fusion of non-contiguous sequences, but rather the attenuation/termination of (\u00b1)strand RNA synthesis at the TRS Sawicki, 1995, 1998) . Such a mechanism may have evolved to provide each of the sg mRNAs with an identical translational enhancer (i.e. a sequence element that increases translation ef\u00aeciency). This is the \u00aerst report of an RNA virus that combines two different strategies, discontinuous and nondiscontinuous transcription, to produce its full set of sg mRNAs. Why toroviruses do so and how this situation arose is not known. If toroviruses evolved from an ancestor that relied on discontinuous mRNA synthesis, mRNA 2 transcription perhaps represents a relict. If, however, the torovirus ancestor utilized a non-discontinuous transcription strategy, the peculiar synthesis of mRNA 2 may be the consequence of a heterologous RNA recombination event. It is of note that the S gene overlaps with the replicase gene and, in contrast to the genes for M, HE and N, is not preceded by a non-coding IGR. A scenario can be envisaged in which the 5\u00a2 part of the S gene, including the IGR and TRS, was deleted or replaced by a foreign sequence and in which a new initiation codon was acquired by fusion to an internal (\u00b11) ORF at the 3\u00a2 end of the replicase gene. If the resulting novel spike protein provided a strong selection advantage, even an initial inef\u00aecient expression may have allowed survival of the mutant virus. An infrequent, though consistent template switch in torovirus-infected cells, driven merely by chance sequence identity between ORF1b and the 5\u00a2 end of the BEV genome, may have given rise to a minor transcription-competent sg (\u00b1)strand RNA species. Subsequently, the discontinuous synthesis of mRNA 2 may have been perfected rapidly to optimize S expression. Be that as it may, torovirus transcription deserves further scrutiny.",

This technique involves the attachment of synthetic adaptor oligonucleotide to the 5\u00a2 end of the mRNA. The adaptor is transcribed and included into the \u00aerststrand cDNA copy only when reverse transcription proceeds across the 5\u00a2 terminus of the mRNA. To ensure that the adaptor is ligated exclusively to mRNAs with an intact 5\u00a2 end, the RNA sample is pre-treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. Thus, contaminating rRNA, tRNA, degraded mRNA fragments and DNA are dephosphorylated and excluded from ligation reactions. mRNAs with an intact, capped 5\u00a2 end are then decapped by treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase, leaving a monophosphorylated 5\u00a2 terminus and allowing subsequent ligation of the adaptor using T4 RNA ligase. RLM-RACE was performed with the FirstChoice\u00d4 RLM-RACE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amounts of intracellular and genomic RNA used per reaction corresponded to that extracted from 2 Q 10 4 BEVinfected Ederm cells and 3 Q 10 7 TCID 50 units, respectively. RT\u00b1PCR with gene-and adaptor-speci\u00aec primers was either performed with M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Superscript II) and Taq polymerase (Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) or with Tth DNA polymerase (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR DNAs were excised from agarose\u00b10.5Q TAE gels, puri\u00aeed using the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, The Netherlands), ligated in vector pGEM-T easy (Promega, Madison, WI) and cloned in Escherichia coli strain pc2495. Plasmid DNA, extracted from individual clones, was subjected to sequence analysis using a T7 RNA polymerase sequencing kit (Pharmacia). For each construct, 6\u00b112 clones were characterized.",
