There are no FDA approved antivirals or vaccines for any coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2 (2). Current treatments for COVID-19 are limited to supportive therapies and off-label use of FDA approved drugs (3). Rapid development and human testing of potential antivirals is greatly needed. A potentially quicker way to test compounds with antiviral activity is through drug re-purposing (2, 4). Numerous drugs are already approved for use in humans and subsequently there is a good understanding of their safety profiles and potential side effects, making them easier to test in COVID-19 patients. Here, we present data on 20 FDA approved drugs tested for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 that we have previously found to inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (4). We find that 17 of these .

A potential route to candidate antivirals is through repurposing of already approved drugs. Numerous chemical compounds are approved for use in humans around the world (such as by the FDA), and their safety profiles are known. Many of these have also been found to have antiviral activity even though that is not their intended use (5) . We have previously screened a library of FDA approved drugs for antiviral activity against two other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (4) . That work found 27 approved drugs that inhibited replication of both of these coronaviruses, suggesting that they may have broad anti-coronaviral activity and inhibit SARS-CoV-2. With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, we have investigated whether 20 of these compounds have antiviral activity against the novel virus. Since these compounds are already approved for use in humans, they make ideal candidates for drug repurposing and rapid development as antiviral therapeutics.",

Whether treating SARS-CoV-2 in this current pandemic or the next unknown viral pathogen, we must attempt to have validated antiviral drugs that are ready at the first signs of an outbreak. Many FDA approved drugs have been found to have antiviral activity and since these are extensively used in humans for other conditions, they could be streamlined for rapid approval for alternative use as antivirals. We previously performed a screen of 290 FDA approved drugs and found a subset of these to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (4). We prioritized testing these for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. From multiple independent screens performed with two MOI, we found that 17 of our 20 tested compounds display significant antiviral activity at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Many of the compounds have IC50 values under 10\u00b5M and these will be the source of follow up testing on additional cell lines and in mouse models of SARS-CoV-2. We have further tested .
