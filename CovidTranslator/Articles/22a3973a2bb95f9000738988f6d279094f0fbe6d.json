The MRI revealed at least 4 intracerebral abscesses and signs of increased intracranial pressure (Fig. 3) . The abscesses were managed by neurosurgery with postoperative external ventricular drains. Aspergillus Antigen Elisa was elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained during surgery (Table 1 ). In a biopsy of the CNS abscess wall A. fumigatus was identified; however, no A. fumigatus grew in culture from tissue or CSF. Since recent guidelines have recommended voriconazole as first choice antifungal in CNS aspergillosis, antifungal treatment was switched to voriconazole (IV; 2 \u00d7 9 mg/kg on day one, followed by 2 \u00d7 8 mg/kg daily). On day 5 of voriconazole treatment, the patient developed acute pancreatitis with vomiting and severe abdominal pain. In addition, no therapeutic voriconazole levels could be detected in the patient's plasma or CSF. Since a liposomal preparation potentially aggravates pancreatitis, we administered caspofungin (50 mg/m 2 BSA/day) instead of voriconazole, until the elevated pancreas enzymes returned to normal and the impaired clinical condition of the patient improved again. Because therapeutic efficacy of caspofungin in invasive CNS aspergillosis is uncertain, antifungal treatment was continued with high dose of liposomal amphotericin B (8 mg/kg/days as a 3-h infusion for 28 days followed by 5 mg/kg/day as a 2-h infusion for 28 days, then 2.5 mg/kg/d 2 times a week as secondary prophylaxis). A subduroperitonal shunt had to be implanted to manage hydrocephalus malresorptivus and subdural hygroma, after neither MRI reexamination nor microbiological assessment of the CSF revealed residual fungal or bacterial CNS disease. The hemiparesis of the patient slowly improved and the attending pediatric oncologists decided to continue chemotherapy with a modified, less intensive regimen. The subduro-peritoneal Shunt was removed after two control MRI examinations. Sixteen months after this eventful induction therapy the patient is still in first remission of his T-ALL receiving maintenance treatment as an outpatient. Clinically he has no pulmonary symptoms and his hemiparesis resolved completely. His psychocognitive performance is according to his age.",

Immediately after the confirmation of this case of Legionnaires' disease, the result was notified to the hospital hygiene and infection control department. To prevent an outbreak involving other immunocompromised patients of the pediatric oncology unit, environmental investigations have to be initiated to identify or exclude an environmental source of the infection (Cunha et al., 2016) The room air in the department of pediatric oncology is filtrated (H13) and all water outlets in patient rooms (including shower tops) are equipped with terminal 0.2 m filters (disposable tap filters; Aquasafe filter AQ31F1S, PALL Corporation; Dreieich, Germany). In addition the water is supplemented with chlorine dioxid (0.2-0.3 mg/l). Six months before the patient was admitted, Legionella spp. had been detected in the hospital warm water supply system. Twice a year the hospital water system is examined for the presence of Legionella spp. After the diagnosis of nosocomial Legionellosis, 20 samples from water pipes of all rooms the child possibly had used were reevaluated with standard methods but no growth of Legionella spp. was detected. However, the isolate of the last positive detection (6 months previously; 6 colony forming units in 100 ml, detected in a water outlet of a bathroom in a different part of the same building) had been stored and was available for comparison with the patient' isolate (typing performed by the National Reference Center for Legionellosis, Dresden, Germany). The patient harbored a L. pneumophila serogroup 1 type Allentown/France whereas the previous isolate from the water pipe was serogroup 1 too but belonged to a different type (Bellingham).",

These devices had been put into place before the unit decided to use terminal water filtration to protect the patients from waterborne pathogens. The patient repeatedly sat on a towel on the floor of the bathroom while his mother was taking a shower (Fig. 4) . The hose emptying devices were removed; in addition to the release of unfiltered water, they may have had a negative impact on the integrity of the water filter membrane due to desiccation. Swabs were taken from the shower basin and the floor of the bathroom, which yielded growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas spp. (not P. aeruginosa).

All water taps in our pediatric oncology unit have been equipped with terminal water filters. However, the already existing water hose emptying devices may have exposed the patient to the pathogen, while he was sitting on the bathroom floor on a towel after his mother took a shower (Fig. 4) . This possible environmental source could not be confirmed, since no sample yielded the growth of Legionella spp. In this regard, we could not determine the origin of our patient's infection, despite that he had been hospitalized continuously for 39 days before the onset of symptoms (the regular incubation period of legionellosis is 2-10 days).",

According to the clinical judgement of the attending pediatric oncologists, the antifungal drug of first choice, voriconazole, caused acute pancreatitis in our patient. We cannot exclude, that the pancreatitis was an adverse event of PEG-asparaginase chemotherapy, but pancreatitis appeared during treatment with voriconazole and disappeared after stopping voriconazole treatment. The recommended voriconazole dose in this age group did not result in sufficient plasma and CSF levels. The pharmacokinetics of voriconazole is highly variable in patients of this age group (Zembles et al., 2016) . Fortunately, the combination of neurosurgical interventions, caspofungin and prolonged treatment with high dose liposomal amphotericin B led to disease control and eventually cure despite ongoing anticancer treatment.",
