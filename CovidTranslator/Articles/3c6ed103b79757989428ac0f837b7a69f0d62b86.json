Newly synthesized proteins are destined to follow two distinct routes, depending on the presence or absence of a signal sequence at their amino termini (37) . The signal recognition particle (SRP) t in the cytosol recognizes and binds to a signal sequence of nascent peptides. The resulting SRP-ribosome-nascent peptides complexes are targeted to the ER membrane through their interactions with the docking protein complex (35, 36) . After translocation across the ER membrane, secretory and plasma membrane proteins follow a common pathway from the ER, through the Golgi complex, to the cell surface by default with bulk flow of lipids (33) . Resident proteins in the central vacuolar system are localized and retained in their final destinations with the aid of either specific targeting (18) or retention signals (25) (26) (27) 44) .",

Experiments using SRP-depleted or -supplemented in vitro systems have shown that this protein does not require SRP for insertion into microsomal membranes (3) . Therefore, the carboxylterminal hydrophobic sequence was termed an \"insertion\" sequence through which spontaneous integration of cytochrome b5 into any exposed membranes could occur not only in vitro, but also in vivo (5) .

The deduced amino acid sequence of this enzyme prediets a similar molecular structure to that of cytochrome b5, a bulky amino-terminal domain without an amino-terminal signal sequence and a short hydrophobic domain at the carboxyl terminus. We report here that msALDH is localized exclusively in the ER in COS-1 cells when expressed from cDNA, and that expression of this protein apparently alters the structure of the ER from a reticular to large vesicular one. In addition, we report that the hydrophobic domain is responsible for membrane anchoring and that msALDH is likely to have two ER targeting sequences on either side of the membrane anchoring domain. Our results suggest a novel mechanism for the posttranslational ER targeting of this tail-anchored protein. (Toyama, Japan), respectively. Since the/3-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase has been shown to be identical to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (34) , this mAb is referred to as PDI mAb in this paper. Rabbit antibodies to rat msALDH, NADPH-cytoehrome P-450 reductase (FP2), and PDI have been prepared and characterized as described (2, 21, 24) .

PCR reactions used the following primers and templates to amplify DNA fragments termed ALDH1-7 and 9: ALDH1; oligonueleotides no. 12 (5' GAGTCCAAGGGTACCTGGTCGAAATTC 3') with mutated nueicotides underlined for introduction of a KpnI site and no. 9 (pCDALDH as template), ALDI-I2; oligonucleotides no. 12 and no. 9 (pCDALDHA481-484 as template), ALDH3; oligonucleotides no. 13 (5' AAACAGTICAAC-GGTACCAGC~TGCAGCTG 3') and no. 9 (pCDALDH as template), ALDH4; oligonucleotides no. 13 and no. 9 (pCDALDHA481-484 as template), ALDH5; oligonucleotides no. 14 (5' GAAATTCTTCGGTACC-AAACAGTTCAAC 3') and no. 9 (pCDALDH as template), ALDH6; oligonucleotides no. 14 and no. 9 (pCDALDHA481-484 as template), ALDH7; oligonucleotides no. 12 and no. 9 (pCDALDHA457-459 as template), and ALDH9; oligonucleotides no. 12 and no. 9 (pCDALDHA460-463 as template). These amplified fragments were then digested with KpnI and HpaI and ligated into the KpnI-EcoRV site of pMIWCAT. The resultant plasmids were designated pMIWCAT/ALDH1-7, and pMIWCAT/ALDH9, respectively. For construction of pMIWCAT/ALDHS, pMIWCAT/ALDH2, which has the unique PstI site in the coding sequence for the hydrophobic domain of msALDH, was digested with PstI and BamHI, and ligated into Pstl/BamHI digested pMIWCATIALDH7. Similarly, the same fragment was ligated into PstI/BamHI digested pM1WCAT/ALDH9 to construct pMIWCAT/ALDH10.",

The nucleotide sequence predicts a polypeptide of 484 amino acids, and the most characteristic feature of this membrane-bound ALDH is carboxyl-terminal 35 amino acids, consisting of a stem region (amino acids 450-463) and a hydrophobic domain (amino acids 464-480) followed by a short hydrophilic tail region (amino acids 481-484) as shown in Fig. 1 . Since rat cytosolic tumor-associated ALDH, which is 65.5 % identical to msALDH (24) , lacks the carboxyl-terminal portion, we asked whether this portion played an important role in the intracellular localization of msALDH. For this purpose, we constructed three mutant proteins truncated at either amino acid 450 (msALDHA450-484, which corresponds to the tumor-associated ALDH in size), 471 (msALDHA471-484, deletion of more than half of the hydrophobic domain together with the tail region), or 481 (msALDHA481-484, deletion of solely the tail region) by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1) . These mutant proteins and wild-type msALDH were expressed transiently in COS-1 cells under the control of SV-40 promoter in the pCD expression vector. This transient expression system in COS-1 cells was chosen as the most rapid method for evaluating the intracellular localization of expressed proteins. Cells were allowed to express these proteins for 44 h, harvested, and the expressed proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-msALDH antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 A, msALDH and three truncated proteins were expressed efficiently in the total homogenates. As expected, molecular masses of the truncated proteins were smaller than that of msALDH (54 kD). In addition, no crossreactive protein was detected in untransfected COS-1 cells (data not shown), indicating the absence of endogenous msALDH. These results allowed us to investigate the intracellular localization of msALDH by transfection experiments.",

Expressed msALDH was found to colocalize with endogenous PDI (Fig. 4 B, arrow) , although PDI displayed a characteristic reticular staining pattern in cells not expressing msALDH (Fig. 4 B, arrowhead) . In contrast, msALDH colocalized neither with a mitochondrial 65-kD protein (Fig. 4 , C and D) nor with the perinuclear Golgi complex visualized by FITC-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (Fig. 4, E and F) . These results strongly suggest the ER localization of msALDH and the drastic morphological change of the ER by expression of msALDH. A similar ER staining pattern was observed for msALDHA481-484 (Fig. 4, G and H) , whereas both msALDHA471-484 and msALDHA450-484 were found distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm, and they did not colocalize with PDI (Fig. 4, I-L) . In addition, a significant amount of msALDHA450-484 appeared to enter the nucleus (Fig. 4 K) . These immunolocalization data were consistent with those from subcellular fractionation, suggesting strongly the important role of the carboxyl-terminal portion of msALDH in its ER localization.",

CAT/ALDH1 contains the last 35 amino acids of msALDH at the carboxyl terminus of CAT, while CAT/ ALDH2-4 chimeras lack either the tail, stem, or both regions of msALDH.

The intracellular localization of the expressed proteins were determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-CAT antibody. Wild-type CAT was distributed, as expected, throughout the cytoplasm. In addition, it was also detected in the nucleoplasm (Fig. 8 A) . CAT/ALDH1 showed the characteristic ER staining pattern (Fig. 8 B) , which was confirmed by double indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using PDI mAb (Fig. 8 C) . This result was similar to that obtained with/5-gaiactosidase/ALDH (Fig. 6 , B and C). Both CAT/ALDI-I2 and CAT/ALDH3 were also found to colocalize with endogenous PDI in the ER (Fig. 8, D-G) . On the other hand, CAT/ALDH4 containing only the hydrophobic domain of msALDH at its carboxyl terminus showed a similar pattern of staining to that of wild-type CAT.

The intracellular localization of these chimeras expressed in COS-1 cells was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Three chimeras, CAT/ALDH5, CAT/ALDH7, and CAT/ALDH9, were supposed to be directed to the ER by virtue of the tail region, even if they lack an ER targeting sequence within the stem region, and indeed they showed the reticu~lar staining pattern including the nuclear membrane (Fig. 10 , A, C, and E). Among the mutant proteins lacking the tail region, CAT/ALDH6 and CAT/ALDH10 showed the reticular pattern (Fig. 10, B and F) . These reticular compartments were confirmed to be the ER by colocalization with PDI (data not shown). In contrast, CAT/ALDH8, which lacks the Lys-Gln-Phe sequence (amino acids 457-459) within the stem region and the tail region, was found distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm (Fig. 10 D) . We investigated in more detail the intracellular localization of CAT and CAT/ALDH chimeras in transfected COS-1 cells using an IgG-gold immunoelectron microscopic technique on frozen ultrathin sections. Gold particles were distributed in the cytoplasm and in the nucleoplasm in COS-1 cells transfected with pMIWCAT ( Fig. 11 A) . A similar distribution of gold particles was observed in COS-1 cells expressing either CAT/ALDH4 (data not shown) or CAT/ ALDH8 (Fig. 11 D) . In marked contrast, gold particles were predominantly detected on the cytoplasmic surface of the ER membrane in COS-1 cells expressing CAT/ALDH1 (Fig. 11  B) , CAT/ALDH7 (Fig. 11 C) , or the other CAT/ALDH chimeras (data not shown). These immunoelectron micro- scopic data are consistent with indirect immunofluorescent data, and these immunolocalization data together strongly suggest that the ER-targeting sequences of msALDH exist within the Lys-Gln-Phe sequence in the stem region and within the Lys-Asp-Gln-Leu sequence of the tail region.",

Surprisingly, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the apparent alteration of the ER structure in cells expressing either msALDH or msALDH-A481-484. The altered ER structure was characterized by large vesicular structures mainly located near the nucleus. Since the unusual staining pattern was observed by expression of msALDH or msALDHA481.484, it appeared that the ER an- choring of these proteins led to the morphological alteration of the ER. We are now investigating in more detail the altered ER structure by immunoelectron microscopy, and we have recently found that the ER tubules in COS-1 cells expressing msALDH are packed in crystalloid hexagonal arrays (Yamamoto, A., R. Masaki, and Y. Tashiro, manuscript in preparation). The elucidation of the altered ER structure would provide interesting information on the morphological change of the intracellular organelle induced by overexpression of a resident membrane protein.",

Both CAT/ALDH4 and CAT/ALDH8 were distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm similar to wild-type CAT in spite of possessing the whole hydrophobic domain (amino acids 464-480) of msALDH at their carboxyl termini, whereas the other chimeras were predominantly localized to the ER. The two chimeras are lacking the Lys-Gln-Phe sequence within the stem region and the Lys-Asp-Gln-Leu sequence of the tail region, thus suggesting that both sequences represent the ER-targeting sequences of msALDH. We are now in the process of determining through mutagenesis which amino acids within these two regions are required for ER targeting. On the other hand, it seems likely that the hydrophobic sequence of msALDH functions mainly as the ER membrane anchor because this portion is essential for membrane anchoring.",

A small portion of msALDHA481-484 was, in fact, recovered in the $3 fraction, whereas only insignificant amounts of msALDH or FP2 (Fig. 2, B and C) , which is efficiently targeted to the ER through the aminoterminal signal sequence, were recovered in the $3 fraction. Therefore, it is likely that the presence of two targeting sequences in the same protein might be a means to ensure the more efficient ER localization of msALDH. In addition, the hydrophilic tail region might also serve to increase the strength of the membrane anchoring, as indicated by the partial membrane extraction of msALDHA481-484 with Na2CO3 (Fig. 3) . Although it is not yet clear whether the (24) . The single amino acid code is used. Positively and negatively charged amino acids are marked + and -at the top, respectively. Each hydrophobic domain is underlined and the ER targeting sequences of either cytochrome b5 (23) or msALDH are indicated by broken lines. (B) Two possible models for ER targeting of msALDH. In model I, the aggregation of the newly synthesized msALDH polypeptides in the cytoplasm is prevented by the hydrophilic ER targeting sequences adjacent to the hydrophobic anchoring sequence. The monomeric msALDH would be inserted into the ER membrane with the aid of a receptor protein on the ER membrane. In model II, the complex of msALDH and a cytosolic \u2022 receptor protein would be targeted to the ER, and msALDH would be inserted correctly into the ER membrane spontaneously or through the interaction with a receptor protein on the membrane.",

However, Andres et al. have shown that proneuropeptide Y mutant bearing the Lys-Asp-Gln-Leu sequence at the carboxyl terminus is processed and secreted like wild-type proneuropeptide Y when expressed in AtT-20 cells, despite the intraceUular retention of the unprocessed proneuropep-",

Frangioni et al. have found that the ER targeting sequence of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP 1B) exists within the carboxyl-terminal 35 amino acids (12). Mitoma and Ito have shown that the last 10 amino acids of cytochrome b5, which include the hydrophilic tail of this protein, are important for its targeting to the ER (23). Fig. 12 A shows an alignment of the last 35 amino acids of PTP 1B (9), cytochrome b5 (32) , and msALDH (24), where each hydrophobic domain is underlined and the ER-targeting sequences of cytochrome b5 and msALDH are indicated by the broken line. Although the sequence required for ER targeting within the last 35 amino acids of PTP 1B has not been defined, PTP 1B and cytochrome b5 have the common Leu-X-Tyr-Arg motif ( Fig. 12 A) within their last 10 amino acids. In addition, PTP 1B and cytochrome b5 have tails of similar length (seven and eight amino acid residues, respectively), which are longer than that (four amino acid residues) of msALDH. It therefore seems likely that PTP 1B possesses a similar ER-targeting sequence to that of cytochrome b5. We have not found in the carboxyl-terminal portion of msALDH a motif similar to that in those two proteins, despite the fact that the ERtargeting sequences of cytochrome b5 and msALDH are both hydrophilic and adjacent to the membrane anchors. In addition, the presence in msALDH of two ER-targeting sequences separated by the membrane-anchoring domain suggests that this protein, with respect to the ER-targeting sequence, belongs to a different class than the other two.",

            "text": "In addition to the three proteins described above, several other ER membrane proteins are known that also have carboxyl-terminal anchors, such as heine oxygenase (40) and ribosome-binding protein p34 (28), but ER-targeting sequences of these proteins have not yet been identified. Cytochrome bS, heme oxygenase, and msALDH are synthesized on free polysomes (29, 41, 45) and posttranslationally targeted to the ER. Indeed, the SRP-independent integration of cytochrome b5 into microsomal membranes has been demonstrated (3). Our present study, together with these findings, suggests a novel pathway by which a class of tailanchored proteins with a novel targeting sequence is directed to the ER.How might the ER-targeting sequence function? Fig. 12 B shows two possible models to explain the ER targeting of msALDH. One possibility (/) is that the hydrophilic targeting sequences serve to prevent the aggregation of the newly synthesized msALDH polypeptides through their hydrophobic anchoring sequences, which makes it easier for them finding a. specific receptor on the ER membrane. Another possibility (I/) is that a cytosolic receptor binds to the targeting sequences of msALDH to form a complex that effects the correct insertion of the carboxyl-terminal anchor into the ER membrane spontaneously or through their interactions with a receptor on the membrane. The elucidation of the mechanisms by which ER localization of msALDH occurs should provide valuable clues for an understanding of the posttranslational targeting and insertion of a class of membrane proteins with a carboxyl-terminal anchor.",
