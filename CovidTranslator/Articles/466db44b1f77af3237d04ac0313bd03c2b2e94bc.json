            "text": "A rctic populations have historically endured the debilitating effects of both endemic and epidemic infectious diseases (1, 2) . The introduction of antimicrobial drugs and vaccines and the establishment of robust public health systems have greatly reduced illness and deaths caused by infectious diseases in many Arctic countries. Despite these interventions, high rates of invasive diseases caused by bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (3) (4) (5) , Haemophilus infl uenzae (6) , Helicobacter pylori (7, 8) , and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (9) (10) (11) (12) continue to persist. In addition, the emergence of antimicrobial drug resistance among bacterial pathogens once easily treated with commonly used antibiotics (10, (13) (14) (15) , the entrance of HIV into Arctic communities (10, 16) , and the specter of pandemic infl uenza or the sudden emergence and introduction of new viral pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are of increasing concern to residents, governments, and public health authorities of all Arctic countries.",

The populations of these countries comprise varying proportions of European and indigenous ancestry. The Arctic is the homeland of the Eskimo; the Inuit of Greenland, northern Canada, and northern Alaska; the Yupik of western Alaska and eastern coastal regions of the Russian Far East; and the Aleut of the Aleutian Chain. The interior and western coastal regions of northern Canada and Alaska are the homes of a wide variety of North American Indian, linguistically distinct groups, including the Athabaskan, Eyak, Tlingit, Gwich'in, and Metis. In Alaska the collective terminology for persons of indigenous ancestry is Alaska Native. Although the group is not registered in offi cial statistics, the Saami people inhabit circumpolar regions of Norway, Finland, and Sweden. The Russian census recognizes (from West to East) the Saami, Nenets, Khanty, Sel'kup, Enets, Nganasan, Dolgan, Even, Chukchi, Chuvan, and Eskimo/ Inuit-Yupik of the Russian Far East. Arctic populations have certain demographic characteristics that separate them from populations in more southern regions. Birth and mortality rates are higher, and life expectancy is lower; a high proportion of the population is thus of younger age (1). In remote regions of the North American Arctic, Greenland, and the northern Russian Federation, many residents live in small, isolated communities that are dependent on hunting and fi shing with little or no economic infrastructure. In these remote regions, public health and acute-care systems are often marginal, sometimes poorly supported, and in some cases nonexistent.",

For example, population-based surveillance for invasive H. infl uenzae type b (Hib) disease in the US Arctic demonstrated prevaccine incidence rates of invasive disease of 601 cases and 129 cases per 100,000/population in Alaska Native and non-Native children <5 years of age, respectively (26) . Immunization programs that use the Hib conjugate vaccine were implemented in the US Arctic in 1991 and resulted in a >10-fold decline in Hib cases in Alaska Native children. However, in May of 1996, continued surveillance detected 4 cases of invasive Hib in children <2 years, and during the next 12 months 10 cases occurred. Most cases were in infants who received 1-2 doses of Hib vaccine after a statewide change in 1996 to a vaccine that was less immunogenic after the fi rst dose (27, 28) . This experience demonstrated the need for continued surveillance after the implementation of a successful vaccine program and the shortcomings of generalizing data from other countries or regions to develop public health policy in the Arctic.",

Among Alaska Native children <2, the rate was 450 cases/100,000 versus 129 cases/100,000 among non-Native children. This surveillance system fi rst detected decreased susceptibility to penicillin in the mid-1980s. Although these isolates were only moderately resistant to penicillin, resistance to multiple antimicrobial drugs was also found by 1989. Isolates fully resistant to penicillin detected in 1993 were fi rst recovered from patients living in urban points of entry to the US Arctic and were indistinguishable from multidrugresistant strains circumnavigating the globe (24, 25) . In the US Arctic, the proportion of pneumococcal isolates fully resistant to penicillin increased from 0% in 1991 to 6.1% in 1998, and the proportion of isolates that were resistant to >2 classes of antimicrobial agents increased from 4.7% in 1991 to 17.7% in 1998. In the US Arctic, the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is recommended for all persons >55 years of age; however, this vaccine remains underused. In 2001, the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced to the childhood vaccination schedule, and by 2003, vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease rates had declined by 91% among Alaska Native children <2 years of age and by 80% among non-Native children <2 years of age. A 40% reduction of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults of all ethnicities suggests an indirect impact or herd effect of this vaccine in nonvaccinated persons. In addition, the use of PCV7 in this population has reduced the proportion of invasive disease caused by isolates resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole (29) .",

The Russian Federation's communicable disease control systems evolved separately from western public health systems and consist of relatively large federal, regional, disease-specific, sector-specifi c (prisons, military), and largely clinical case-based reporting systems (10). These differences, together with the relative isolation of northern and far-eastern regions of the Russian Federation, the language barrier, and absence of information exchange, have led to some difficulties in establishing cross-border cooperation in infectious disease prevention and control. However, because of a sharp rise in the 1990s in the incidence of communicable diseases such as HIV, sexually transmitted diseases, and tuberculosis (including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis) in the Baltic and Barents Sea regions, several initiatives are now aimed at improving cooperation in infectious disease prevention and control between countries of northwestern Europe and adjacent regions of the Russian Federation. For example, in 1999 the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, together with other Nordic state epidemiologists, established a program to strengthen infectious disease control in the Barents and Baltic Sea states and has since established a framework for communicable disease surveillance communication and training in northern Europe (www.epinorth. org). These activities provide a model for expanding cooperation and developing partnerships for the exchange of infectious disease surveillance information in other northern and far-eastern regions of the Russian Federation.

This investigation, together with data from Alaska that indicated that 78%-84% of invasive pneumococcal disease among children <2 years of age could be prevented by using PCV7, resulted in the implementation of vaccine programs in 3 northern regions of Canada using both the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine and PCV7 in 2002. The introduction of PCV7 in the US Arctic (2001) and northern Canada (2002) has resulted in a rapid decrease in the proportion of isolates resistant to penicillin and other antimicrobial drugs, compared with the situation in countries not using the vaccine (Iceland and Finland) (34) .

The average Arctic temperature has risen at almost twice the rate of that in the rest of the world in the last 2 decades and could cause changes in the incidence and geographic distribution of infectious diseases already present in Arctic regions (39) . For example, an outbreak of Vibrio parahemolyticus-related gastroenteritis was reported in July 2004 among cruise ship passengers that consumed raw, farmed oysters in the Prince William Sound area of Alaska (\u224860\u00b0 north latitude), >1,000 km further north than previous reported outbreaks. The July-August water temperature of the oyster farm had increased 0.21\u00b0C per year since 1997; 2004 was the fi rst summer on record that the mean water temperature exceeded 15\u00b0C, the threshold temperature for the harvest of implicated oysters, which suggests that the ocean warming trend was responsible for this outbreak (40) . Similarly, higher ambient temperatures in the Arctic may result in an increase in other temperature-sensitive foodborne diseases and infl uence the incidence of zoonotic infectious diseases by changing the populations and range of animal hosts and insect vectors. The melting of the permafrost together with an increase in extreme weather events such as fl ooding may result in damage to water and waste disposal systems, which may in turn increase community outbreaks of foodborne and water-borne infections. Temperature and humidity markedly infl uence the distribution, density, and biting behavior of many arthropod vectors, which again may infl uence the incidence and northern range of many vector-borne diseases (39) . These examples emphasize the need for an established surveillance network in Arctic regions for monitoring emerging climate-sensitive infectious diseases.",
