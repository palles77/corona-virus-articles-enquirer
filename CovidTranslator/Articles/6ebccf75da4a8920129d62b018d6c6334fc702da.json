            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus whose principal site of replication is the ciliated epithelial cells of the respiratory tract mucosa of chickens. Viral replication occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and virions are formed by budding from the endoplasmic reticulum. There are three viral structural proteins: spike (S; peplomers), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). S and M proteins are both glycosylated and parts of them are exposed at the surface of the virion. The spike protein consists of two glycopolypeptides, S 1 and $2, which have molecular weights of 90 kDa and 84 kDa, respectively (Cavanagh, 1981) . The membrane protein is present as a number of distinct species which have molecular weights ranging from 23 kDa to 34 kDa; the molecular weight differences are associated with the various degrees of glycosylation. N protein (54 kDa) is associated with the viral RNA.",

IBV was solubilised in NP40 detergent and centrifuged in a sucrose gradient containing this detergent in order to purify the nucleocapsid protein. The addition of 1 M NaCI to the sucrose solutions was required for the purification of the spike and membrane proteins, as they co-migrated in gradients containing low salt concentrations. However, the nucleocapsid protein could not be purified in gradients containing high salt concentrations. The yield of material from these gradients was relatively low, due to the limited number of fractions which contained purified viral components. In other studies purified spike material contained some nucleocapsid protein and the membrane preparation contained other proteins which were thought to be of cellular origin.",

By making use of the specificity of the antibody pure material can be isolated, even from a crude mixture of proteins. The method is very quick and easy and the immunoadsorbent can be used several times. Thus, relatively large amounts of purificd material can be obtained. The availability of spike and membrane proteins in a highly purified form will allow more biochemical, structural and immunological studies to be done.",

Thc profile of neutralizing antibodies shown in this paper agrees with previous published findings (Holmes, 1977; Mockett and Darbyshire, 1981; Hawkes et al., 1983) . The results show that anti-spike antibodies produced early after infection are non-neutralizing, as assessed by our in vitro technique. This raises the question as to the function of these antibodies in thc chicken. Previous evidence has shown only the spike protein to be capable ofeliciting neutralizing antibodies. There is a possibility that the anti-spike antibodies could be neutralizing in vivo and the function of the anti-membrane antibodies could be similar. The possible role of these antibodies in protection remains to be resolved.",
