            "text": "Background: The genus Orthobornavirus comprises non-segmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses able to infect humans, mammals, reptiles and various birds. Parrot bornavirus 1 to 8 (PaBV-1 to 8) causes neurological and/or gastrointestinal syndromes and death on psittacines. We aimed to identify and to produce epidemiologic knowledge about the etiologic agent associated with a death of two female Psittacus erithacus (grey parrot). Methods and Results: Both parrots were submitted for a complete standardised necropsy. Tissue samples were analysed by PCR. The findings in necropsy were compatible with bornavirus infection. Analysis revealed PaBV-4 related with genotypes detected in captive and in wild birds. The N and X proteins of PaBV-4 were more related to avian bornaviruses, while phosphoprotein was more related to variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 (VSBV-1). Within the P gene/phosphoprotein a highly conserved region between and within bornavirus species was found. Conclusions: Portugal is on the routes of the intensive world trade of psittacines. Broad screening studies are required to help understanding the role of wild birds in the emergence and spread of pathogenic bornaviruses. PaBV-4 phosphoprotein is closer to VSBV-1 associated with lethal encephalitis in humans than with some of the avian bornaviruses. The highly conserved P gene/ phosphoprotein region is a good target for molecular diagnostics screenings.",

            "text": "Bornaviruses are enveloped, 80 to 100 nm in diameter with a non-segmented genome of single-stranded negative sense RNA of around 8900 nucleotides in length, belonging to the order Mononegavirales [1] . Bornaviruses replicate in the nucleus of the nerve cells of various organs and establish persistent, non-cytolytic infections by exploiting the cellular splicing mechanisms to efficiently use its genome, organized into six open reading frames (ORFs) [1] (Figure 1 ). Alternative transcription start and stop sites and splicing produce mRNAs that are translated to produce the viral-encoded proteins [1] (Figure 1 ). The first transcription unit contains an ORF for the nucleoprotein (N), the second transcription unit contains two overlapping ORFs for the phosphoprotein (P), and the X protein (X) [1] (Figure 1 ). The third transcription unit is spliced differently, and also has different transcription initiation and termination signals, enabling polymerase read-through during transcription, which results in expression of the matrix protein (M), the glycoprotein (G), and the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (L) [1] ( Figure 1 ). The P and X ORFs overlap; as well as, the M and G ORFs [1] (Figure 1 ). The immunogenicity of phosphoprotein [2] , as well as, the degree of conservation of the phosphoprotein and its gene, within and between bornavirus species, make them good candidates as universal targets in laboratory diagnosis [3] . Once the family Bornaviridae is expanding speedily [4] , producing knowledge about highly conserved regions within phosphoprotein will be useful for the development of sensitive laboratory diagnostic tools. So far, genus Carbovirus, Cultervirus and Orthobornavirus have been identified, which comprise 11 species [4] . From those, 10 species are associated with the development of severe neurological and/or gastrointestinal disease and death of its hosts [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] (Figure 2 ). The disease has been reported in humans, several species of pets, production and wild animals [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Namely, two species infect mammals (Mammalian 1 to 2 orthobornavirus), five infect birds (Passeriform 1 to 2 orthobornavirus, Psittaciform 1 to 2 orthobornavirus and Waterbird 1 orthobornavirus) and three infect reptiles (Queensland carbovirus, Southwest carbovirus and Elapid 1 orthobornavirus) [4] (Figure 2 ). However, some Mammalian 1 orthobornavirus showed the ability to also infect farmed ostriches and wild birds (mallards and jackdaws) [10, 16] . Wild birds are hosts of avian bornaviruses (e.g. strains of Waterbird 1 orthobornavirus and Psittaciform 1 orthobornavirus) [13] [14] [15] 17] and mammalian bornaviruses (e.g. genotypes of Mammalian 1 orthobornavirus) [16] . Therefore, co-infection may play a role in the emergence of new pathogenic and zoonotic bornavirus species; once X and P proteins of PaBV-4 look like to have different ancestors [3] .",

            "text": "In Psittaciformes, parrot bornavirus 1 to 8 (PaBV-1 to 8) can cause proventricular dilatation disease (PDD), characterized by a flaccid and distended proventriculus impacted with feed, as a result of the inability of seeds' digestion (however throughout the gastrointestinal tract can occur variable distention) [18] . Psittaciformes can also show uncoordinated movements, postural disorders, apathy, blindness, and behavioural disorders, such as loss of appetite [1] . The genomic map is similar for all bornaviruses, as far as known, except for Queensland carbovirus and the Southwest carbovirus, which have the gene order 3\u02b9-N-X-P-G-M-L-5\u02b9, representing a transposition of the G and M genes [19] . Figure 2 . Phylogeny shows the species and strains belonging to the Bornaviridae family, which were associated with the development of neurological and/or gastrointestinal disease and/or death of its hosts. The phylogenetic relationship between species and strains was based on a segment of the M gene. Sequences identified by GenBank\u00ae accession numbers and abbreviated name of virus. Bornaviruses marked with asterisks are not classified following the currently accepted taxonomy [4] . ABBV-1 to 2 = aquatic bird bornavirus 1 to 2, BoDV-1 to 2 = Borna disease virus 1 to 2, CnBV-1 to 3 = canary bornavirus 1 to 3, EsBV-1 = estrildid finch bornavirus 1, JCPV = jungle carpet python virus. LGSV-1 = Loveridge's garter snake virus 1, SWCPV = southwest carpet python virus, PaBV-1 to 8 = parrot bornavirus 1 to 8, VSBV-1 = variegated squirrel bornavirus 1. and self-mutilation (resulting from lesions in the central nervous system) [18] . Within captive birds, the virus has become relevant for Psittaciformes housed in reserves, in breeding projects of rare species, in private collections and zoos, because of the severe effects it may cause for bird welfare, economy, and biodiversity levels. Analyses of molecular epidemiology suggested that a world trade of psittacines without biosafety measures has been carried out [3] . There is, to the best of our knowledge, no publications identifying and characterizing the avian bornaviruses infecting pet parrots in Portugal. Moreover, there are still unresolved questions on the epidemiology of bornaviruses, such as the role of waterbirds in the emergence and dissemination of new pathogenic and zoonotic species, and the localization of highly conserved regions within P gene inter-and intraspecies of bornaviruses.",

Extraction of total RNA from the tissue samples was done as previously described [3] . Briefly, the TRIzol/chloroform method (TRIzol reagent, Life Technologies) was used followed by purification with the RNeasy\u00ae Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), as recommended by the manufacturer's instructions. Estimation of the total RNA concentration was achieved using NanoDrop\u00ae ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five hundred nanograms of total RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA as previously described [3] . The cDNA was amplified by two conventional PCR protocols, one using a set of primers specific for a fragment of the N gene (the forward primer: 5\u02b9-CATGAGGCTATWGATTGGATTA-3\u02b9 and the reverse primer 5\u02b9-TAGCCNGCCMKTGTWGGRTTYT-3\u02b9) and the other was carried out with a set of primers specific for a fragment of the M gene (forward primer: 5\u02b9-CA AGGTAATYGTYCCTGGATGG-3\u02b9 and the reverse primer: 5\u02b9-ACCAATGTTCCGAAGMCGAWAY-3\u02b9). In both protocols, the thermal cycling parameters and the reaction composition of PCR were carried out as previously described [3] . The expected length of the conventional products was 389 base pairs (bp) for the fragment of the N gene and 352 bp for the fragment of the M gene. From the positive samples, for both genes, selected tissues were used to conduct an additional PCR, combining the forward primer targeting the N gene and the reverse primer targeting the M gene, under previously reported experimental conditions [3] . The expected length of the PCR product was 1600 bp (covering a partial region of the N gene, a total region of the X and P genes and a partial region of the M gene). The visualization of the PCR products was in electrophoresis using a 2% agarose gel, staining with Gel Red TM (Biotium Glowing Products for Science TM , Hayward, CA) at 0.002%. The PCR products from all tissue samples tested were purified using the GRS PCR & Gel Band Purification Kit (GRISP, Porto, Portugal) and both strands of DNA were analysed by Sanger sequencing.

That is, the PaBV-4 genotypes are evolutionarily closer to the VSBV-1 genotypes, linked to the infection of squirrels (from zoos and breeding collections) and humans than members of Waterbird 1 orthobornavirus (ABBV-1 and ABBV-2) and of Mammalian 1 orthobornavirus (BoDV-1), detected in samples of wild birds (Figure 7) . Namely, within genotypes detected in wild-bird samples, Borna disease virus (BoDV-1) is the most evolutionarily distant from parrot bornavirus (PaBV-4) (Figure 7(a) ). However, within Borna disease virus (BoDV-1) the genotype associated with lethal encephalitis in humans (accession n\u00ba MH190827.1) is evolutionarily more distant from PaBV-4 than the variants detected in samples of wild Anas spp. (Figure 7(a) ). When the phylogenetic analysis was conducted based on the amino acids encoded by the segment of the P gene, the main evolutionary relationship remained between bornaviruses (Figure 7(b) ). The findings obtained through the several analyses conducted suggest that within parrot bornavirus (PaBV-4) genotypes the N and P gene had different ancestors. Since the N gene of PaBV-4 is evolutionarily more close to the N gene of avian bornaviruses (Figure 6(a,b) ), while P gene is more related to mammalian bornaviruses, specifically with the zoonotic variegated squirrel bornavirus (VSBV-1) genotypes (Figure 7(a,b) ). Additionally, the findings showed that the Borna disease virus (BoDV-1) detected in samples of wild birds (accession n\u00ba AF233071.1, AF232702.1 and AF232703.1) are intermediate variants between the two BoDV-1 genotypes Figure 5 . Phylogenetic relationships between PaBV-4 genotypes identified in the present study and PaBV-4 detected in wild birds as in pet parrots, regarding N gene. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [21] . The confidence probability was estimated using the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) and is shown above the branches [22, 23] . The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Kimura two-parameter method [24] and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. The analysis involved 60 nucleotide sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There was a total of 163 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 [20] . Sequences identified by GenBank\u00ae accession numbers, abbreviation name of virus and its hosts, year and geographic origin of sampling. PaBV-4 = parrot bornavirus 4. The sequences marked with a circle were produced during this study and triangles marked nucleotide sequences identified from wild birds.",

            "text": "In the present study, we produced additional and detailed information to the previous reported insights about the degree of conservation of X and P protein within and between species of bornaviruses [3] . As previously reported, the P protein (phosphoprotein) showed to be more conserved between and within species of bornaviruses than the X protein [3] . However, the present study showed that, within and between bornaviruses, the degree of conservation throughout the P protein was not constant (Table  1) . Namely, intra-and inter-species of bornaviruses, the identity percent of the first 68 amino acid was higher than the following 133 amino acid of P protein ( Table 1 ). The region showing a higher identity percentage is a shared amino acid sequence with X protein. In contrast, throughout the X protein, the lower identity percent (intra-and inter-species of bornaviruses) comes from the region shared with P protein (Table 1) . Therefore, the first 18 amino acid of the sequence revealed to be more conserved within X protein (Table 1) . Nevertheless, when comparing both conserved regions of the two proteins, the X protein showed a smaller variability range of the amino acid sequence (Table 1) . However, its most conserved region represents about 20.9% of the X protein, which corresponds approximately to 54 nucleotides of the gene, making it less advantageous as a target region (in the design of tools) for molecular diagnostics, compared to the more conserved region of the P protein. In the case of P protein, the most conserved region corresponds approximately to 68 nucleotides, among species of family Bornaviridae, allowing more options in the design of molecular tools, aiming to decrease the occurrence of false negatives. In some cases, despite all findings of clinical diagnosis, the inability to amplify the viral nucleic acid might be a consequence of the presence of unknown species of bornaviruses in samples [7] . Thus, a decrease in the number of false negatives is expected, since the highly conserved regions in evolutionarily more distant viruses will be more identical to the bornaviruses described so far. Therefore, the highly conserved region is a good candidate as a target in laboratory diagnostics for screening purposes of potential reservoirs or asymptomatic carriers, as well as to confirm the clinical diagnosis. The information produced about the highly conserved region is thus useful, since the diversity of members of the family Bornaviridae is expected to be higher than reported, considering the evolution of the scientific knowledge produced. In fact, between the end of twentieth century and the beginning of twenty-first century, the family Bornaviridae comprised only the Mammalian 1 orthobornavirus species [26] . From then to the present, the family Bornaviridae includes 11 species and 19 strains [4] . Moreover, within each of the 19 strains, there are several genotypes described, as, for example, the taxonomic group PaBV-4 that integrates more than 30 genotypes [3] .",

Over the years, the international trade, without biosafety measures [3] , is expected to have had negative implications on biodiversity. Whereas, in the last 19 years (based on the oldest data collection ( Figure 5 )), bornavirus infection has contributed to the reduction of endangered specimens [3, 27] . The Psittacus erithacus is one of the endangered species (according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)) [27] included in the list of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) [28] . In Portugal, the lawful trade of endangered species of parrots is supervised by several national entities working with CITES [29] .",

Also, it suggests there are at least two factors (the wild birds and the world trade of psittacines) that, simultaneously or singularly, might be a factor for the dissemination of the PaBV-4 infection. Some of the PaBV-4 genotypes detected in pet parrots are phylogenetically adjacent to some genotypes detected in wild bird samples ( Figure 5 ). In our analytical approach, it was not possible to include the genotypes of PaBV-4 detected in wild parrots from Brazil [30] , because the nucleotide sequences were not available in the GenBank\u00ae database.",

            "text": "Over the last years, the evidence that wild birds could be reservoirs of bornaviruses has been accumulated [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . In addition to the parrot bornavirus 4, cases of infection in wild birds with several genotypes of parrot bornavirus 2 (such as Anas spp., Grus spp., Haliaeetus spp., Larus spp., Galidris spp., Calidris spp. and Emberiza spp.), Borna disease virus 1 (such as Anas spp., and Coloeus spp.) and aquatic bird bornavirus 1 to 2 (such as Cygnus spp., Greylag spp., Canda spp. and Anas spp.) have been reported [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . The co-infection was reported to occur in wild birds by different strains and genotypes belonging to Psittaciform 1 orthobornavirus [17] . It could then be expected that all members of the family Bornaviridae could be involved in co-infection events, since there are species of wild birds that may be hosting a wide range of genotypes from several species of bornaviruses (such as Waterbird 1 orthobornavirus [13] [14] [15] , Psittaciform 1 orthobornavirus [17] and Mammalian 1 orthobornavirus [16] ). Therefore, co-infected reservoirs can play a role in the emergence of new virus variants, providing conditions for the occurrence of changes in virulence and in host range by two major ways: through recombination exchange between virus strains and through accumulation of amino acid changes that are under pressure by the immune system (antigenic drift event). Both events have been reported to occur within viruses belonging to the order Mononegavirales [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . A previous study reported findings of Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1) genome segments in samples from wild birds (such as Anas spp. and Coloeus spp.) in Uppsala, Sweden, which showed an intra-species divergence [16] . Namely, they revealed to be divergent from each other, as they were divergent from the Borna disease virus (BoDV-1) genotypes detected from naturally infected cat, lynx and horse in the same area [12] . In the present study, the bioinformatics approach suggests that the N and P genes of parrot bornavirus 4 (PaBV-4) have had different ancestors (Figure 6(a,b); and 7(a,b) ). Namely, within PaBV-4 genotypes, the N gene showed to be evolutionarily close to avian bornaviruses (members of Waterbird 1 orthobornavirus) and P gene revealed to be closer to mammalian bornaviruses (members of Mammalian 2 orthobornavirus) (Figures 6 and 7) . Moreover, the phylogeny conducted based on the P gene segment revealed that the Mammalian 2 orthobornavirus members (VSBV-1 (accession n\u00ba LN713681.1 and MF597762.1)) associated with lethal encephalitis of humans in Germany are evolutionarily closest related to PaBV-4 (Figure 7(a) ). On the other hand, the Mammalian 1 orthobornavirus genotypes associated with death of humans in Germany, (accession n\u00ba MH190827.1 and LT991983.1), are evolutionarily closer to bornaviruses detected in wild birds (such as ABBV-1, ABBV-2 and BoDV-1 in Denmark, Germany, Sweden and USA) (Figure 7(a) ). Furthermore, the Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1) variants detected in samples of wild Anas spp. (accession n\u00ba AF232700.1 and AF232701.1) are phylogenetically adjacent to BoDV-1 genotypes associated with lethal outcomes in humans (accession n\u00ba LT991983.1 and MH190827.1), as well as to the vaccine strain (accession n\u00ba DQ680832.1/rabbit, Germany, 1948) (Figure 7(a) ). In fact, the Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1) detected in samples of wild Anas spp. are intermediate genotypes, positioned in the evolutionary line, between the two genotypes that were the cause of death of humans (accession n\u00ba MH190827.1 and LT991983.1) (Figure 7(a) ). When the analysis was conducted based on the amino acid sequence encoded by the P gene segment, the main phylogenetic relationship remained between aquatic bird bornavirus (ABBV-1 to 2), parrot bornavirus (PaBV-4), variegated squirrel bornavirus (VSBV-1) and Borna disease virus (BoDV-1) genotypes (Figure 7(b) ). However, their evolutionary relationship changed when the phylogenetic analysis was based on the segment of the N gene (Figure 6(a) ). The findings revealed that the N gene of PaBV-4 genotypes shared their ancestor with avian bornavirus (ABBV-1 and ABBV-2) detected in wild birds ( Figure  6(a) ). Furthermore, the parrot bornavirus (PaBV-4) and variegated squirrel bornavirus (VSBV-1) genotypes diverged earlier in the evolutionary line, regarding N gene (Figure 6(a) ). However, parrot bornavirus (PaBV-4) remains evolutionarily closer to variegated squirrel bornavirus (VSBV-1) than to the Borna disease virus (BoDV-1) detected in samples of wild birds (accession n\u00ba AF233071.1, AF232702.2 and AF232703.1) and in human tissues (accession n\u00ba MH190827.1 and LT991983.1) (Figure 6(a) ). Interestingly, from an evolutionary point of view, the Borna disease virus (BoDV-1) detected in wild birds remains as intermediate variants between the two genotypes linked to the death of humans, based on their nucleoprotein profile ( Figure 6(b) ).",

The characterized viruses were phylogenetically related with PaBV-4 worldwide distributed in captive psittacines, suggesting that Portugal is on the route of the international trading, which occurs without biosafety measures. Moreover, the PaBV-4 genotypes detected in Portugal are evolutionarily closer to some genotypes found in wild birds in Japan, than with some of those found in pet psittacines in Europe. More studies are needed to clarify the role of wild birds in the introduction of bornaviruses to captive parrots. The N and X proteins of PaBV-4 are more related with avian bornaviruses detected in samples of wild migratory waterbirds, while phosphoprotein is phylogenetically closer to mammalian bornaviruses, as the variegated squirrel bornavirus (VSBV-1) genotypes linked to lethal encephalitis of humans. Wild migratory birds may be a key element in understanding the intraand inter-continental emergence and dissemination of pathogenic variants of mammalian and bird bornaviruses. The role of co-infected wild reservoirs in the emergence of new virulent variants and in the host range modification should be addressed in future studies. For screening purposes, the highly conserved P gene/ protein region is a good candidate as universal target in laboratory diagnostics of bornaviruses.",
