The isolation of these antibodies, most of which are rarely induced in human infections, has primarily been achieved by large-scale screening for suitable donors and new single B cell approaches to human monoclonal antibody generation. Engineering the antibodies to improve half-life and effector functions has further augmented their in vivo activity in some cases. Super-antibodies offer promise for the prophylaxis and therapy of infections with a range of viruses, including those that are highly antigenically variable and those that are newly emerging or that have pandemic potential. The next few years will be decisive in the realization of the promise of super-antibodies.

In these settings, the antibodies act to neutralize bacterial toxins. Therapies followed in which serum antibodies were targeted directly against bacterial and then viral pathogens. For viral pathogens, enriched polyclonal IgG molecules from immunized animals were shown to be effective in prophylaxis, and even prophylaxis after exposure, for a number of viruses, including hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus, measles virus, rabies virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), smallpox virus and varicella zoster virus. In general, the effective ness of antibody preparations declined with the dura tion of infection such that they were often regarded as poor therapeutic options. Of course, the major antiviral strategy of the 20th century was vaccination.",

The advent of hybridoma technol ogy in 1976 provided a reliable source of mouse mono clonal antibodies (mAbs), the first impact of which was not on antibody therapy but on the characterization of cells through the definition of cell surface markers. Broad implementation of mAbs in therapy had to wait until the development of humanized mouse antibodies and then the generation of fully human antibodies by vari ous techniques described below. Such antibodies have been largely applied in the fields of oncology and auto immunity. Only a single antiviral mAb, the RSVspecific antibody palivizumab, is in widespread clinical use. The reasons for this have been discussed elsewhere 1,3-6 , although perhaps the most important reasons are the fairly high cost of the production of mAbs, the difficul ties of administration and a belief that antibodies are largely effective only in a prophylactic setting, which can be achieved for many viruses by vaccination.",

Increased potency can greatly reduce the unit costs of treatment, make alternative routes of administration feasible and extend the effective halflife of the antibody.

            "text": "Many acute viral infections induce robust neutralizing antibody responses in the large majority of individuals. In general, these viruses show little evidence for evasion of antibody responses, and we have referred to them as 'evasion lite' viruses 7 . Typically, they either display limited antigenic variability in their surface protein (or proteins) or show considerable variability but never theless express immunodominant, conserved epitopes. Examples of viruses in this category include measles virus, poliovirus, chikungunya virus and RSV [8] [9] [10] [11] . The life cycle of these viruses presumably does not dictate immune evasion. For these types of viruses, the iso lation of superantibodies from immune donors has been achieved in a fairly straightforward manner 8, 9, [12] [13] [14] . However, some viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade effective neutralizing antibody responses (termed 'evasion strong' viruses) and induce such responses at much lower levels. Effective responses in the context of infection with highly antigenically variable viruses refers not only to their neutralization potency but also to their effectiveness against diverse circulating global isolates, often referred to as breadth. For these viruses -includ ing HIV, influenza virus, Ebola virus and Lassa virus -only a proportion of infected individuals, sometimes quite small, will generate broad and potent neutralizing antibody responses [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, within these indi viduals, potent broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) specificities generally constitute only a small fraction of the antigenspecific memory B cell pool.",

Although there are probably multiple factors that contribute to the low abundance of bnAbs within these individuals, the intrinsic nature of the viral Env protein likely has a key role. The HIV Env protein has evolved a multitude of mechanisms to evade bnAb responses, including decoy forms of Env, enormous antigenic variability, an evolving glycan shield, immunodominant and variable epitopes and poorly accessible conserved epitopes 23 . Furthermore, most HIVspecific bnAbs incorporate unusual features for epitope recognition, such as uncommonly long (or short) complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) loops, insertions and deletions, tyrosine sulfation and extensive somatic hypermutation, that likely also con tribute to the rarity and delayed development of bnAbs during natural infection 24-26 .",

The relatively low frequency of bnAbs against the HA stem is perhaps due to the typically tight packing of HA trimers on the virus surface, which may limit antibody accessibility to this region. For Ebola and Lassa viruses, extensive glycosylation on the surface Env proteins results in masking of conserved neutral izing epitopes 15, 32 . In cases where superantibodies are present at low frequency within immune repertoires, largescale donor screening and highthroughput B cell isolation platforms have proved to be critical for the dis covery of superantibodies.

In the case of HIV, which has served as a prototype virus for many studies in this field 33 , systematic selection of donors with broadly neutralizing serum responses has proved to be critical for the identification of superantibodies. Before 2009, the HIV field had been operating with a handful of bnAbs, all of which were limited either in breadth or in potency 34 . A number of factors complicated the iden tification of bnAbs, including the inefficiency of tradi tional approaches to mAb discovery, the small fraction of B cells that secrete bnAbs and the limited availability of samples from donors who had developed broad and potent neutralizing serum responses. Beginning in 2005, the problem of limited samples was addressed by estab lishing donor screening programmes to identify HIV infected individuals with broadly neutralizing serum responses to serve as source material for the generation of bnAbs 18, 19, 35, 36 . In one of the largest studies, ~1,800 HIVinfected individuals from Australia, Rwanda, Uganda, the United Kingdom and Zambia were screened for broadly neutralizing sera using a reduced pseudo virus panel representative of global circulating HIV iso lates 19 . A subset of individuals, termed 'elite neutralizers' , was identified that exhibited exceptionally broad and potent neutralizing serum responses and was therefore prioritized for bnAb isolation.",

Although all of these technologies have proved valuable for mAb generation, the recent burst in superantibody Human antibody heavy-chain and light-chain genes are amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and antibody fragments are displayed on the surface of a particle or cell in which the antibody genes are found (such as phage, yeast or mammalian cells [142] [143] [144] [145] ). Successive rounds of enrichment are performed to select for clones that bind to the target antigen.

Upon immunization, the transgenic mice produce fully human antigen-specific antibodies. discovery has primarily been driven by advances in single B cellbased methods. There are several possi ble reasons for this, including inefficiencies in combi natorial library generation and interrogation (leading to the loss of rare clones), altered binding characteristics of antibody fragments produced in heterologous expres sion systems (for example, Escherichia coli or yeast), constraints on the generation of suitable recombinant antigens for immunization or library selections, the loss of native heavychain and lightchain pairing during immune library generation and inherent differences between the adaptive immune systems of humanized mice and humans 45 . Several technological breakthroughs in the B cell cloning arena have been most critical in fuelling superantibody identification. One of these advances came in 2009, when direct functional screening of thousands of B cell clones from an HIV elite neutralizer led to the isolation of two superantibodies, PG9 and PG16, that were approximately an order of magnitude more potent than firstgeneration bnAbs 37 . Notably, PG9 and PG16 bind poorly to recombinant Env pro teins and thus would not have been identified without direct functional screening of B cell supernatants. To date, many dozens of HIVspecific bnAbs targeting a diverse range of epitopes have been identified using functional screening approaches 39,46-48 . Highly potent superantibodies to RSV, HMPV, Lassa virus and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) have also been dis covered using highthroughput functional screening technologies 12, 13, 49, 50 (TABLE 1) .",

            "text": "One of the advantages of the plasmablast approach is that antigen baiting is not required for B cell sorting, thereby allowing for the isolation of antibodies that target epitopes that are poorly presented on recom binant antigens. For example, in the case of dengue virus, potent bnAbs targeting Edimerdependent epitopes were isolated using this approach 72 . However, it is important to emphasize that the ability to isolate superantibodies using this method will depend on several factors. First, during a primary infection, the ASC population will be mainly composed of activated, lowaffinity naive B cells (rather than affinitymatured memory B cells), making the possibility of identifying superantibodies extremely unlikely. Second, in the context of a booster vaccination or secondary infec tion with an antigenically similar virus, most of the plasmablast response will be directed against immuno dominant epitopes, which in many cases are not tar geted by effective neutralizing antibodies. In such cases, exhaustive cloning, production and characterization of the plasmablastderived mAbs would likely be required to identify rare superantibodies. By contrast, secondary infection with an antigenically related but sufficiently divergent virus can drive the preferential expansion of B cells that target highly conserved epitopes, as exemplified by the unusually high frequency of bnAbs induced in donors who were infected with the novel H1N1 influenza virus in 2009 (REFS 29, 75) . In principle, one could use this type of approach for the generation of superantibodies in humanized mice or other animal models by using suitably designed immunogens and immunization regimens. In response to the 2014-2015 MERSCoV outbreak, two different groups illustrated the power of their mAb discovery platforms by isolating highly potent MERS specific mAbs, producing the mAbs in gram quanti ties and testing the lead mAbs in animal models at an unprecedented speed 53,77 . In one of these studies, a sin gle highly potent MERSCoVneutralizing mAb was identified from the memory B cells of a convalescent donor through the use of a highthroughput functional screening approach 53 . This mAb, called LCA60, showed protection both before and after exposure in a mouse model of MERSCoV infection. Importantly, this process took the authors only 4 months from the initial B cell screening to the development of a stable cell line that produces the neutralizing mAb at 5 g l -1 . In the second study, human immunoglobulin transgenic mice were immunized with the MERSCoV spike protein and then used to generate a panel of potent MERSCoVspecific neutralizing mAbs within several weeks 77 . The authors also quickly generated a humanized mouse model of MERSCoV infection, which was used to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of their mAbs.",

However, the development of effective vaccines against many impor tant viral pathogens -including HIV, RSV, hepatitis C virus, dengue virus and HCMV -has been met with limited success. Furthermore, vaccine development is a long complex process, often lasting 10-15 years, making immunization an impractical means of pro tecting individuals from newly emerging viral threats unless panvirus family vaccines can be developed. For example, if antibodies can be identified that potently neutralize existing strains of Ebola virus, or even Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, then one could anticipate that a vaccine templated from the antibodies would also be effective against emerging strains of Ebola virus. However, at the current time, passive antibody prophy laxis represents a promising alternative to vaccination for a number of viral infections. Currently, three purified polyclonal hyperimmune globulins derived from human donors immune to hepa titis B virus, HCMV or varicella zoster virus are on the market for the prevention of serious diseases associated with these viruses. A rabiesvirusspecific immune globulin, combined with vaccination, is also available for prophylaxis after exposure. In 1998, palivizumab -a humanized mAb that targets the RSV F proteinbecame the first antiviral mAb approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Palivizumab soon replaced the RSV hyperimmune globulin (RespiGam) for the prevention of severe RSVassociated disease in high risk infants. However, although palivizumab is more specific and 50-100 times more potent than RespiGam, the cost associated with the required dosing makes its use impractical for all infants 94 . A secondgeneration RSVspecific mAb, which shows up to 50 times greater neutralization potency than palivizumab and contains substitutions in the Fc domain that extend its serum halflife, is currently in phase II clinical trials for the pre vention of severe RSVassociated disease in all infants 95 (TABLE 2) .",

            "text": "To bypass the challenges associated with active vaccination against HIV, a number of groups have proposed alternative strategies on the basis of vec tormediated antibody gene transfer to express bnAbs in vivo 107 . Unlike traditional passive immunization, which would require longterm repeated treatment with bnAbs, vectored immunoprophylaxis involves only a single injection and enables continuous and sustained delivery of antibodies. In 2009, pioneering work demonstrated that vectormediated delivery of antibodylike molecules can provide vaccinelike pro tection against simian immuno deficiency virus (SIV) challenge in nonhuman primate models 108 . Subsequent studies have shown that vectored immunoprophylaxis is also compatible with fulllength IgG molecules and CD4like molecules [109] [110] [111] . If the preclinical results in mice and macaques translate to humans, vectored antibody gene delivery strategies could provide an alternative form of prophylaxis against HIV and other challenging vaccine targets, such as hepa titis C virus, pandemic influenza virus and malaria. Recently, non viral vector nucleic acid delivery technologies have also been developed to obviate the potential safety issues associated with viral vectormediated delivery, such as longterm persistence and potential viral DNA integra tion into the host genome [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] . In a recent study, it was shown that the administration of lipid encapsulated nucleosidemodified mRNAs encoding the heavy chain and lightchain genes of the broadly neutral izing HIV1specific antibody VRC01 to humanized mice resulted in high serum antibody concentrations and protection against intravenous HIV1 challenge 114 . Similar proofofconcept studies have also been per formed using synthetic DNA plasmid mediated anti body gene transfer 112, 113 . In one such study, synthetic DNA plasmids encoding crossneutralizing anti dengue virus antibodies were delivered to mice by electro poration and resulted in biologically rele vant levels of serum antibody 112 . Importantly, a single intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA conferred protection against severe dengue disease in a mouse model. Although several technical challenges remain to be addressed, such as enhancing in vivo antibody expression levels and reducing the potential for immunogenicity, these studies demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing plasmid DNA and modified mRNAbased antibody delivery technologies for passive immunotherapy.",

Conventional wisdom says that antibodies are effective if present before or shortly after viral exposure, but their effectiveness declines markedly once infection is established. For example, the anti RSV antibody palivizumab is effective in the clinic prophylactically but not therapeutically 118 . However, there are indications that the dogma may be chal lenged by superantibodies. An example is the ability of a new generation of bnAbs against HIV to strongly impact ongoing infection in animal models 87, 119, 120 in which an earlier generation of lesspotent mAbs had very limited effects 121 . This ability likely reflects the increased neutralization potency of the super antibodies as well as the increased breadth of neutral ization that may restrict virus escape pathways 119 . A number of superantibodies are now being evaluated in humans for their activities against established HIV infection [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] (TABLE 2) . Initial results are interesting, providing for example an indication of enhanced immune responses following bnAb administration 127 . The emerging results will be followed closely, includ ing in the context of combining bnAbs with drugs and other antiviral agents to attempt HIV cure.",

However, there are also a number of additional effects from this enhanced potency that may not be instantly appreciated and that can be further strengthened by antibody engineer ing. For example, enhanced potency means that less antibody needs to be used, and this can enable easier to develop, lowconcentration subcutaneous adminis tration rather than the use of more difficulttodevelop, high concentration sub cutaneously administered formulations or less convenient (lowconcentration) intravenous administration. Enhanced potency also means that the lifetime of an effective antibody follow ing administration is extended, thereby requiring fewer administrations to maintain a useful protective or thera peutic effect. Antibody engineering can also extend its halflife considerably 95, [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] so that for the most potent superantibodies, one could envisage requiring administrations perhaps only every 3-6 months for effectiveness. Antibody engineering can also deliver greater effectiveness through enhanced Fc effector function 140, 141 .",

The answer to this question will depend on a number of factors: first, the rapidity of development of antiviral vaccines (vaccines will likely remain the least expensive and most effec tive antiviral measure, but some viruses such as HIV present a large challenge to vaccine development); sec ond, the effective cost of antibody treatment, which incorporates not only manufacturing cost but also the durability of the administered antibody and the route of administration; and third, the success of anti bodies in the treatment of established viral infections. Particularly in the therapeutic setting, the answers can only be obtained with clinical trials using the best superantibodies available. 108-111 (2017) .
