In this study we attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the inhibition of BX-795 on Herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication. HEC-1-A or Vero cells were treated with BX-795 and infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2 for different periods. BX-795 (3.125-25 \u00b5mol/L) dose-dependently suppressed HSV-2 replication, and displayed a low cytotoxicity to the host cells. BX-795 treatment dose-dependently suppressed the expression of two HSV immediate-early (IE) genes (ICP0 and ICP27) and the late gene (gD) at 12 h postinfection. HSV-2 infection resulted in the activation of PI3K and Akt in the host cells, and BX-795 treatment inhibited HSV-2-induced Akt phosphorylation and activation. However, the blockage of PI3K/Akt/mTOR with LY294002 and rapamycin did not affect HSV-2 replication. HSV-2 infection increased the phosphorylation of JNK and p38, and reduced ERK phosphorylation at 8 h postinfection in the host cells; BX-795 treatment inhibited HSV-2-induced activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinase as well as the phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF-2, the downstream targets of JNK and p38 MAP kinase. Furthermore, SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor) or SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) dose-dependently inhibited the viral replication in the host cells, whereas PD98059 (an ERK inhibitor) was not effective. Moreover, BX-795 blocked PMA-stimulated c-Jun activation as well as HSV-2-mediated c-Jun nuclear translocation. BX-795 dose-dependently inhibited HSV-2, PMA, TNF-\u03b1-stimulated AP-1 activation, but not HSV-induced NF-\u03baB activation. Overexpression of p38/JNK attenuated the inhibitory effect of BX-795 on HSV replication. BX-795 completely blocked HSV-2-induced MKK4 phosphorylation, suggesting that BX-795 acting upstream of JNK and p38 MAP kinase. In conclusion, this study identifies the anti-HSV activity of BX-795 and its targeting of the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathways in host cells.",

The c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and are primarily responsible for the stress signal and proinflammatory cytokine stimulations. Activated JNK/p38 MAP kinase can transmit upstream signals to downstream fac-tors, thus mediating cellular apoptosis, differentiation, growth or immune responses [4, 5] . JNK and p38 MAP kinase are also reported to be stimulated by many viruses or virus-associated proteins, including rotavirus [6] , varicella-zoster virus (VZV) [7, 8] , HIV-1 [9] , HSV-1 [10, 11] , coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) [12] , Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [13] , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [14] and hepatitis B/C virus (HBV/HCV) [15, 16] . The activation of the JNK/p38 MAP kinase cascade induced by these viruses either facilitates the viral lytic cycle or serves as a defense mechanism of the host cells. Therefore, virusinduced activation of the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathway is considered to be universally important for viral infection or cell survival [6, 7, 10, 12, 16] .",

Surprisingly, we observed that BX-795 exhibited an inhibitory effect on the HSV-2-induced cytopathogenic effect (CPE) (data not shown). Using an In-cell Western assay, we analyzed HSV glycoprotein D (gD) expression in the presence of serial concentrations of BX-795 in HEC-1-A cells. gD protein is an HSV membrane protein representing late events in the viral life cycle. As shown in Figure 1B and C, BX-795 inhibited both HSV-1 (HF) ( Figure 1B ) and HSV-2 (G) ( Figure 1C ) replication in HEC-1-A cells in a dose-dependent manner. The same inhibitory activity of BX-795 was also demonstrated in Vero cells, as shown in Figure 1D and E. The inhibitory activity of BX-795 on HSV-1 and HSV-2 infectivity was also investigated using progeny virions released from infected HEC-1-A or Vero cells to infect Vero-ICP10-promoter cells.

As shown in Figure 2 , when cells were pretreated with BX-795, ICP0 and ICP27 mRNA transcription of HSV-1 ( Figure 2D ) and HSV-2 ( Figure 2E ) increased in a dose-dependent manner at an early stage of viral infection (6 h postinfection) (the effect of BX-795 is complex at 6 h pi, particularly the enhancing effect for ICP0 at 6 h pi). In contrast, at 12 h postinfection, BX-795 exhibited an inhibitory effect on the expression of not only these two IE genes but also on the late gene (gD) in a dose-dependent manner. Based on these observations, we speculate that BX-795 did not reduce HSV IE gene expression directly at the early period of the viral life cycle and that its apparent inhibitory activity on ICP0, ICP27 and gD mRNA level 12 or 24 h postinfection might be due to the decreasing level of infectious progeny virions in the presence of BX-795.",

The results in Figure 4C indicated that only SB203580 and SP600125, but not PD98059, inhibited viral replication in both HEC-1-A and Vero cells in a dosedependent manner, suggesting that JNK and p38 pathways were the rate-limiting steps in HSV viral protein synthesis and replication, consistent with previous reports [10, 11, 17] . We found that BX-795 interfered with the phosphorylation and activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinase induced by HSV-2 infection of HEC-1-A cells 12 h postinfection ( Figure 4D ). Furthermore, BX-795 blocked HSV-2-induced activation of c-Jun and ATF-2 ( Figure 4E ), c-Jun phosphorylation and the activation stimulated by PMA ( Figure 4F) , suggesting that the BX-795 blockage of virus-induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation was not specific for the virus-associated protein, but rather, targeted certain cellular kinases associated with the viral infection. We also confirmed that BX-795 inhibited c-Jun nuclear translocation ( Figure 4G ) induced by both HSV-2 infection and PMA, consistent with the results shown in Figure 4D -4F.",

To further confirm that the effect of BX-795 on viral replication is JNK/p38 dependent, we investigated the effect of p38/JNK overexpression on HSV replication inhibited by BX-795. The results indicated that, when compared with the BX-795-pretreated cells, viral replication increased slightly when the cells overexpressed p38/JNK with BX-795 treatment ( Figure 4J ). The results indicated that inhibition of HSV replication by BX-795 can be at least partially rescued by overexpression of p38/JNK.

Phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP 3 ), the phosphorylated form of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4)-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ), which is catalyzed by PI3K, can trigger membrane colocalization of PDK1 and Akt and lead to downstream mTOR activation [41, 42] . Hsu et al reported that HSV-1 infection induced activation of the Akt pathway in oral epithelial cells which was mediated by HSV IE gene expression [43] . BX-795 is a PDK1-inhibitory pyrimidine with an IC 50 of 111 nmol/L in the cell-free system [22] and also active in inhibiting HSV-2-induced Akt phosphorylation and activation in a dose-dependent manner as shown in the current study ( Figure 3B ). However, the results with the specific PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, and an inhibitor of downstream mTOR, rapamycin, suggested that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway did not affect viral late gene expression and replication because neither molecule inhibited the viral late gene expression ( Figure 3C ), although HSV-2 activated the PI3K/Akt pathway in human genital tract epithelial cells ( Figure 3A) . It was shown that the inhibition of PI3K attenuated HSV-1 ICP0 gene expression but did not affect thymidine kinase expression and viral replication. An alternative explanation could be that BX-795 can also act on a different target from those of LY294002 and rapamycin, such as PKC or downstream factors, leading to the activation of JNK/p38 mediated by MKK4, 7 and MAPK.",

McLean et al reported that activation of JNK was necessary for efficient HSV replication, and stable expression of JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP-1, an inhibitor of JNK translocation to the nucleus) led to a 70% reduction in HSV-1 propagation [10] . Karaca et al found that the presence of SB203580 in HSV-1-infected cell culture attenuated 85%-90% virus yield [11] . This finding was consistent with our results on HSV-2 replication in HEC-1-A cells shown in Figure 4C . The activation of JNK/p38 MAP kinase may stimulate viral gene transcription via downstream AP-1 activation. JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathways can be induced not only by HSV-2 infection but also by stimuli, such as PMA and TNF-\u03b1 ( Figure 4) . We demonstrated that HSV-2 infection induced c-Jun and ATF-2 phosphorylation and AP-1 binding activity ( Figure 4B and 4H ). c-Jun and ATF-2 are two components of the transcription factor AP-1, which regulates gene expression in response to a variety of stimuli, including cytokines, growth factors, stress and microbes [44] . These two proteins are substrates of JNK and p38 MAP kinase. The transcriptional activity of c-Jun is regulated by phosphorylation through JNK [45] , and ATF-2 can be a target of the JNK or p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways [32] [33] [34] . The viral replication increased when cells were pretreated with BX-795 and overexpressed p38/JNK ( Figure 4J ), indicating that overexpression of p38/JNK partially rescued HSV replication inhibited by BX-795. We, therefore, postulate that BX-795 inhibited HSV infection by attenuating activation of the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathway and downstream AP-1 activation.",

However, Hargett et al employed HSV IE gene mutant viruses to investigate viral proteins necessary for JNK/p38 MAP kinase activation and showed that ICP27 alone was sufficient [46] . Although some controversies exist, it is apparent that viral immediate-early events are responsible for JNK/p38 MAP kinase activation. Evidence has suggested that activation of the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathway was necessary for HSV early and late gene transcription. As shown in Figure 2 , BX-795 exhibited no inhibitory effect on viral ICP0 and ICP27 transcription at 6 h postinfection but a significant inhibitory effect at 12 h postinfection.

However, using a protein kinase assay in a cell-free system, Clark et al reported that BX-795 did not influence MKK3/6 or MKK4/7 activation. The discrepancy between Clark's results and our results may be attributed to the different experimental systems used (cell-free in Clark's and cell-based assay in ours) or, although less likely, by the higher BX-795 concentrations used in our experiment. Another potential explanation is that the direct target of BX-795 in the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathway may be upstream of JNK/p38 and MKK4. Reports have shown that BX-795 inhibited MLK1 (MAP3K9), MLK2 (MAP3K10) and MLK3 (MAP3K11), which could act as an upstream activator of MKK4 and JNK/p38 MAP kinase [19] . We postulate that BX-795 inhibited the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathway by interfering with upstream MLK1-3. However, this hypothesis requires further investigation.",

TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 play a vital role in coordinating the activation of IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB in the innate immune response [48] . IRF-3 is a member of the interferon regulatory transcription factor family [49] and is pivotal for IFN production and the innate immune response to viral infection [49] . IFN is known to have an inhibitory effect on HSV IE and early protein expression [50] . Ma et al [51] reported that HSV infection inhibited TBK1 activity, which facilitated viral productive infection, indicating that TBK1 is a negative regulator of HSV propagation. BX-795 inhibited IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 with IC 50 at 41 and 6 nmol/L in a cell-free system, respectively. It was not clear whether its anti-TBK1/IKK\u03b5 activity contributed to anti-HSV efficiency. Therefore, the effect of BX-795's anti-TBK1/ IKK\u03b5 activity on HSV infection, if any, would facilitate viral replication.",
