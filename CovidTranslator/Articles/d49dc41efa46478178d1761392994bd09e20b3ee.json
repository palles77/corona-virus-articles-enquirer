Methods: A national sample of 1720 community dwelling adults of age 18 and older were surveyed by individual visits during April 2005. Demographics, state of influenza vaccination, reasons for vaccination or non-vaccination and perceptions on vaccinations were asked by questionnaire. Results: Influenza vaccination coverage in general population and high risk group was 34.3% and 61.3%, respectively. Predictors for vaccination were !65 of age, performance of regular exercise, vaccination in the previous season, experience of influenza-like illness, belief that vaccine can prevent common cold and opinion that vaccine must be taken annually. The most common reason for vaccination for both whole population and high risk groups was to prevent both influenza and common cold, while the most common reason for non-vaccination was the thought that he/she was healthy enough not to be in need for vaccination. Having more information on influenza and vaccination as well as doctor's recommendation for vaccination appeared to be the most important modus operandi to encourage influenza vaccination among non-vaccinees.",

Healthy adults may suffer from high fever, headache and myalgia, whereas clinical manifestations are more serious in high risk patients such as elderly or patients with comorbid conditions and may even cause death due to respiratory complications. 1e3 The clinical course of influenza differs by age, immune status, characteristics of circulating influenza strains, comorbidities and pregnancy status. 4 Changes at antigenic sites of influenza virus render a new strain that can avoid the immunity induced by previous strains, thus causing influenza epidemics. 5 The most effective way of preventing influenza is to immunize with vaccines made after prediction of antigenic variation. In one study, inactivated vaccine showed efficacy of 86% reduction in influenza-like illness in healthy adults when vaccine strain was well matched with predominant circulating strain. 6 Although antibody production rate is lower in people over the age of 65, various studies proved influenza vaccine to be effective in reducing influenza related diseases and complications, hospitalizations and mortality in this group. 7e11 The priority group who are recommended for annual vaccination includes persons aged !65 years, persons with chronic illness such as chronic cardiopulmonary disease, diabetes, chronic liver disease and malignancy, residents of long term care facilities, health-care personnel and pregnant women. 12 The Center for Disease Control and Prevention is expanding the priority group for vaccination in recognition of the significance of influenza and importance of vaccination. The priority group for influenza vaccination have been also expanded in Korea; pregnant women and persons aged 50e64 years were newly added in 2003 and children of age 6e23 months were added in 2004. 13 People working in organizations dealing with SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) have been newly added in response to the movement of CDC.",

In the season 2004e 2005, vaccines for 17 million people were supplied, and according to the sales statistics, it is estimated that 33% of total population have been vaccinated. 13 These percentages are comparable to other countries: Fedson 14 reported in 2000 that influenza vaccine distribution per 1000 population was 183 doses in Korea, and this number is relatively high compared to Northern America (265 doses), Western Europe (170 doses), Southeast Asia (0.04 dose) and worldwide (37 doses). 15 Vaccine distribution rate grew even higher to 359 doses per 1000 population in 2004. 13 Korea shows relatively high influenza vaccine distribution rate, however, exact vaccination coverage among total population or priority group have not yet been studied. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set a goal to increase vaccination rate in the priority group to reach at least 60%. 13 Nevertheless, vaccination coverage rate has been calculated according to the sales record, and nationwide vaccination rate by self-report of the whole population or priority group has never been studied.

Questions about drinking, smoking and exercise habits and comorbid conditions were asked. The interview continued with asking whether or not the respondent was vaccinated in the season 2004e2005 and 2003e2004. If the respondent was vaccinated in the season 2004e2005, further questions on the reason of vaccination was asked. Thirteen reasons were presented, and respondents were to choose as many as they wish. For non-vaccinated respondent, the reasons of non-vaccination were asked in a form of multiple choice questions with 15 reasons. Six yes-or-no questions on opinions about influenza vaccine were presented to all respondents. Further 11 yes-or-no questions about opinions on influenza and influenza vaccination were presented to high risk group. All respondents were asked whether they intended to have vaccinated in the following season.",

First, high risk group consisted of only persons !65 or persons with comorbid condition, and therefore, the whole priority group were not included in the analysis. Secondly, the survey was conducted in April, when it was past the influenza season and therefore recall bias might have occurred. Thirdly, the presence of comorbid condition and vaccination uptake were totally relied on self-reports of the subjects and therefore actual presence of illness or vaccination uptake might have been over-or under-estimated.",
