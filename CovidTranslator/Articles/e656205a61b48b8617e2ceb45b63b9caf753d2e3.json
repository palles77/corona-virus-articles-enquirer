Unlike wild type AtT-20 cells, the variant cannot store or release on stimulation, free glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. In addition, the variant cells cannot store trypsinogen or proinsulin, proteins that are targeted to dense core secretory granules in wild type cells. The regulated pathway could not be restored by transfecting with DNA encoding trypsinogen, a soluble regulated secretory protein targeted to secretory granules. A comparison of secretion from variant and wild type cells allows a distinction to be made between constitutive secretion and basal secretion, the spontaneous release of regulated proteins that occurs in the absence of stimulation.",

The concentrated contents of the secretory granules are released from cells in response to external signals, whereas no signals are required for constitutive secretion.

The steps involved in constitutive secretion have been elucidated in yeast using temperature-sensitive secretion mutants (Novick et al., 1980; Schekman, 1985) . In mammalian cells, mutants have been described that influence secretion, but most of these mutations involve changes in the structure of the secretory protein itself, or changes in its posttranslational modification (for review see Tartakoff, 1983) . Many examples of defective secretion involve proteins that are constitutively secreted, such as immunoglobulin chains (for review see Scharff et al., 1975) or viral glycoproteins (Tufaro et al., 1987) . Mutations in the machinery of constitutive secretion are often lethal since the constitutive pathway is responsible for the normal membrane traffic vital for cell growth. Nonlethal mutations that affect the regulated secretory process have been reported for ciliated protozoa, for example in the exocytosis of trichocysts in Paramecium (Aufderheide, 1978; Lefort-Tran et al., 1981) and mucocysts in Tetrahymena (Orias et al., 1983; Maihle and Satir, 1985) . In this paper we describe a mammalian cell variant that has lost its capacity for regulated secretion.",

In addition to regulated secretion of ACTH, AtT-20 cells secrete proteins such as laminin from a constitutive secretory pathway (Burgess et al., 1985) . In this paper we have characterized a variant of AtT-20 cells that does not express several soluble markers of the dense core secretory vesicle, including ACTH, and does not have morphologically identifiable dense core secretory granules. We are now able to experimentally distinguish in endocrine cells, two types of unstimulated secretion, basal release and constitutive secretion. In earlier estimates of the efficiency of sorting in AtT-20 cells we ignored basal secretion when measuring sorting into the regulated pathway (Moore and Kelly, 1985) . The secretion properties of the variant cell line indicated that a considerable fraction of the protein sorted into the regulated pathway was secreted in the absence of stimulation by what we term basal secretion.",

To see if dense core secretory granules were present or absent in the HYA.15.6 variant cells, sections of epon-embedded cells were examined in the electron microscope. Electron micrographs of 25 random fields of ACTH-negative HYA.15.6 or ACTHpositive HYA.15.10 cells were taken and the numbers of dense core granules counted. Photos of ACTH-positive cells (HYA.15.10) contained 681 morphologically identifiable dense core vesicles. In contrast, photos of the ACTHnegative cells (HYA.15.6), contained only one dense structure that could have been a dense core vesicle.",

These include chromogranin A (Iacangelo et al., 1988) , secretogranins (Rosa et ai., 1985) , sulfated proteins such as B15 (Moore et al., 1983a) , and the \"sulfated staircase\" which represent proteoglycans that are sulfated on glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains (Moore et al., 1983a; Burgess and Kelly, 1984) . Many of these components were not expressed by the HYA.15.6 variant. The sulfated proteoglycans and proteins, sorted into the regulated secretory pathway and released on stimulation of cells containing the regulated secretory pathway, HYA.15.10 ( Fig. 2 A, lanes I and 2), were not made or released into the medium by the HYA.15.6 variant ( Fig. 2 A,  lanes 3 and 4) . The only sulfated material in extracts of HYA.15.6 cells was higher molecular weight material that did not enter the gel and some material that migrated as a diffuse band (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and 8) . Although some sulfated material migrating at 97 kD could be seen decreasing in the cell extracts after stimulation, a corresponding appearance in the stimulated medium could never be reproducibly detected. In addition, neither chromogranin A nor its mRNA could be easily detected in HYA.15.6 cells because expression was at such low levels (Grimes, M., and R. B. Kelly, unpublished results).",

The [35S]GAGs were identified after gel electrophoresis as the ladder of radioactive material that migrated between the protein molecular weights of 2.3-14 kD (Fig. 2 B) . In wild type cells, 40% of the [3sS]GAGs were secreted into the medium with a half time of ,x,30 min, while the remainder of the GAGs was stored intracellularly (Fig. 3 A) . After a chase period, treatment with 8-Br-cAMP increased the amount of GAG chains released into the media twofold, suggesting that GAGs were indeed stored in the regulated secretory pathway (Fig. 3 C) . In contrast, variant cells released 98 % of their [35S]GAG chains, with a halftime also of \u2022 30 min (Fig. 3 B) . No stimulation of secretion of the remaining 2 % of the GAG chains could be seen after the addition of 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 3 D) . Longer incubation times of cells in xyloside and [35S]sulfate more extensively labeled the stored pools of [35S]GAG chains in wild type cells, since they have a half-time longer than 1 hour. No evidence of storage of GAG chains or their regulated release could be detected in the variant cells even under these conditions. Wild type AtT-20 cells were over twenty times more efficient at storing [35S]GAGs than the variant and the GAGs were stored as efficiently as trypsinogen, ACTH, and insulin. Either the variant did not have secretory granules into which GAGs may flow, or the GAGs could not enter the granules because of missing components of the sorting machinery. The apparent efficiency of sorting of the GAG chains into the regulated pathway is not consistent with the earlier assumption (Burgess and Kelly, 1984) that they can be used as a bulk phase marker.",

            "text": "If empty secretory granule membranes were present in the variant cells, and absence of the dense core was because of the lack of specific contents (as opposed to free GAG chains) to be packaged in the membranes, then secretory granules might be induced in the variant by introducing a protein normaily packaged into vesicles of the regulated pathway. To test this possibility, trypsinogen, a protein that is sorted into regulated granules was expressed in HYA.15.6 variant cells by DNA-mediated transfection. Trypsinogen is targeted in transfected wild type cells to the same regulated secretory compartment that houses the endocrine hormones, ACTH, and insulin (Burgess et al., 1985 (Burgess et al., , 1987 Orci et al., 1987) . To test for the formation of a regulated pathway in trypsinogen transfected AtT-20 variants, cells were labeled for 16-20 h in medium containing [35S]methionine or cysteine, chased for several intervals, and then stimulated to release the labeled material in the regulated pathway (Moore and Kelly, 1985; Burgess et al., 1985) . In agreement with previous reports, trypsinogen secretion from wild type cells was characteristic of the regulated secretory pathway (Burgess et al., 1985; Moore et al., 1983b) . There was a slow release of labeled trypsinogen in the absence of stimulation. Only 13 % of the total labeled trypsinogen was released in the first chase period and the secretion rate fell off with a half time of 5 h. A 5.3-fold increase in release of trypsinogen was obtained when the secretagogue 8-Br-cAMP was present during the last chase period (Fig. 4 A) . In contrast, trypsinogen secretion from the HYA.15.6.T.3 variant was much more rapid. 90% of the trypsinogen was released during the first chase interval, consistent with a half time of secretion of ~,,40 rain. The amount of trypsinogen that was secreted was not increased by exposure to 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 4 B) . Expression of the regulated secretory protein, trypsinogen, by the variant cells does not, therefore, induce formation of the regulated secretory pathway or reveal the presence of empty secretory granules, lacking content proteins. :The unstimulated release of trypsinogen by the variant, corresponding to a half time of secretion of *40 min, is considerably faster than unstimulated release by wild type AtT-20 (t~ = 5 h). The rate of trypsinogen release from unstimulated variant cells was compared to the rate of constitutive secretion of immunoglobulin chains by wild type cells. In plasma cells, secretion of antibodies has been shown to be Constitutive, with no evidence for their storage or their stimulated release (Tartakoff and Vassalli, 1978; Tartakoff et al.,i 1977) . Antibodies are convenient constitutive secretory proteins to study because the genes for the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains expressed by many plasma cell tumor lines have been cloned. A cell line of particular interest, the MPC-11 plasmacytoma, expresses both IgG2b heavy chain and r light chain but over-expresses the latter. The r light chains not assembled with heavy chain are secreted freely into the medium (Laskov and Scharff, 1970) , making r chain a good candidate for a simple, soluble product to use as a constitutive secretory marker in nonlymphoid cells such as AtT-20 cells. AtT-20 cells transfected with the MPC11 r light chain gene made high levels of r chain, and secreted it with kinetics that were identical to that of immunoglobulin secretion in normal plasma cell lines. In transfected cells, 75 % of the labeled r light chain was secreted during the first chase interval and the half time of secretion was '~1 h. Stimulation with 8-Br-cAMP did not enhance the amount of light chain secreted (Fig. 4 D) . Since transfected trypsinogen was secreted from the AtT-20 variant at a rate indistinguishable from that of the constitutively secreted r-light chain in transfected wild type cells (Fig. 4, B and D) , it is very likely that unstimulated secretion in the variant is from the constitutive secretory pathway.",

One possibility is that unstimulated release in wild type cells is not due entirely to constitutive secretion but also because of basal release. Basal release is secretion from the regulated pathway in the absence of prior stimulation with a secretagogue. If a secreted prohormone is processed to its mature form after sorting into the regulated pathway (Orci et al., 1987b) , then basal release will appear as the unstimulated release of mature hormone. When the secretion of insulin forms was examined in wild type cells (Fig. 4 C) , mature insulin was indeed released in the absence of stimulation. During the chase, the rate of [35S]labeled insulin secretion dropped with a half life of,'o 3 h, while the rate of proinsulin secretion fell with a half time of only 40 rain. The kinetics suggest that mature insulin is released basally from secretory granules and proinsulin from the constitutive pathway. Consistent with this explanation is the observation that whereas exposure to 8-Br-cAMP increased the rate of insulin secretion sevenfold, it had no effect on the rate of proinsulin secretion. Proinsulin-transfected HYA.15.6 variant cells secreted proinsulin and neither stored it nor processed the prohormone to the mature form (data not shown). Comparison of the variant and wild type cells clearly demonstrates therefore, two forms of unstimulated release, constitutive and basal.",

            "text": "In the initial experiments on pathways of secretory protein sorting in AtT-20 cells, the regulated pathway was functionally defined by secretion of the ACTH hormone in response to a secretagogue while the constitutive pathway was defined by the externalization of a viral membrane protein, gp70, which did not require exposure to a secretagogue (Gumbiner and Kelly, 1982) . Unresolved in this work and in subsequent studies was whether constitutive secretion accounted for all unstimulated release, especially the slow release observed for \"regulated\" proteins, endogenous as well as transfected (Burgess et al., 1985; Moore and Kelly, 1985) . The AtT-20 variant was clearly lacking the regulated secretory pathway and all secretion from these cells was rapid and constitutive. The characteristics of secretion by the variant allow us to propose that there must be two pathways of unstimulated release in wild type cells: constitutive secretion, as described in our earlier work, and basal release from compartments that come after sorting into the regulated pathway. Since the regulated pathway is missing from the variant, basal release must also be missing. Basal release may be because of the fusion of mature regulated secretory granules with the plasma membrane in the absence of stimulation or the budding of vesicles from immature granules as proposed by yon Zastrow et al. (1987) . Whatever the mechanism of basal release, it accounts for a large fraction of the total secreted protein and has important consequences for the analysis of sorting in neuroendocrine cell lines. Thus measuring the ratio of stimulated to unstimulated release need not be a measure of sorting but a measure of what fraction of the material sorted into the regulated pathway that can be released by stimulation with secretagogues. Furthermore, the sorting index used by Moore and Kelly (1985) to measure protein sorting efficiencies, by ignoring basal release, underestimates the ability of AtT-20 cells to correctly sort proteins into the regulated pathway.",

In wild type AtT-20 cells, almost half of the [35S]GAG chains made in a 1-h pulse, remained stored in a releasable compartment at the end of a long chase (Fig. 3) . The storage of GAGs in the regulated secretory pathway was of surprisingly high efficiency, comparable to that found for ACTH, human growth hormone (Moore and Kelly, 1985) , trypsinogen (Burgess et al., 1985) , and insulin (Kelly et al., 1989) . Apparently, the GAG chains are not true bulk-phase markers as proposed by Burgess and Kelly (1984) . A tripeptide (N-octonoyI-ASN-TYR-THR-NH2) that behaves as a bulk-phase marker (Wieland et al., 1987) is excluded from the regulated secretory pathway in insulin-secreting cells (Gold et al., 1988) . GAGs may be sorted from the trans-Golgi network into the secretory granules either by a GAG-specific receptor, similar to the hormone-specific receptor (Chung et al., 1989) , or by association with a protein that is sorted. The latter mechanism has been invoked to explain sorting of an anti-secretogranin I antibody into secretory granules ). An alternative possibility is that in AtT-20 cells the machinery for synthesizing and sulfating GAG chains remain active in the immature granule after protein sorting events have occurred. Consistent with this alternative in our finding in AtT-20 cells that sulfated-labeled proteins and oligosaccharides appear to be sorted more efficiently than methionine or cysteine-labeled proteins (Matsuuchi, L., and R. B. Kelly, unpublished resuits) . Preferential secretion from parathyroid tissue of sulfate-labeled chromogranin A is also seen and was explained by proposing that sulfation occurs after the sorting of chromogranin into secretory granules (Gorr and Cohn, 1990) . In pulse-labeled PC12 cells, in contrast, no sulfation of immature or mature secretory granules was seen (Tooze and Huttner, 1990) . To resolve this point, similar experiments need to be done in wild type and variant AtT-20 cells.",
