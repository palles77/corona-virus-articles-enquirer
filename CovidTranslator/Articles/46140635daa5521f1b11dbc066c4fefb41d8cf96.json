The use of Big Data has allowed disease trends to be identified and outbreak origins to be tracked and even predicted. Big Data is not getting smaller. The challenges we face are to hone our analytical capacity to address the huge \"signal-to-noise\" ratio with adequate computing power and multidisciplinary teams that can handle ever-increasing amounts of data. Big Data will also create the opportunity for future applications of bespoke (or personalized) treatment.",

The term originated before the turn of the millennium when in the 1990's when John Mashey was Chief Scientist of Silicon Graphics (SGI). At the time, SGI was at the forefront of computer graphics and was struggling to deal with significantly expanding computational needs that outpaced available hardware. Mashey developed a presentation in the late '90s that laid out the looming collision between Big Data and computational performance (1).",

A good example of this was the detective work undertaken to respond to a measles outbreak during the 2010 Olympics (7). Using whole genome sequencing Gardy and colleagues were able to exactly identify many of the reported cases (30 of 82). One important finding was that there was more than one type of measles virus involved in the outbreak. While traditional genotyping for the measles virus has focused on the sequences of phosphoprotein and hemmagglutinin, two specific genes used to distinguish isolates, Gardy et al. showed that there were additional variations in other measles genes that could be used for a more precise definition of the viral lineages.",

The scale of text mining scientific manuscripts published in journals, news reports describing emergent issues and 140 character tweets truly is daunting when one considers that Twitter collects \u00bd billion tweets per day (6) . What makes matters even more challenging is that disease surveillance doesn't simply mean aggregating news feeds. Rather, the key for a meaningful Big Data strategy to disease surveillance is the identification of the potential risk. Approaches such as GPHIN (4) are thus crucial for national and international preparedness for disease outbreaks. As Big Data continues to grow at exponential rates, trying to advance our capacity to analyze it becomes an ever-changing holy grail.",
