Blood and turbinate wash samples, and lung tissue were collected from each animal at different time points after SARS coronavirus (CoV) infection for determining the growth curve of virus, if any, by the standard infectivity assay in Vero E6 cells. In addition, sections of the lung, liver, spleen, and kidney were taken and used for histology analysis. All animals were observed daily for signs of illness, and in some experiments, animals were weighed on the day when they were sacrificed. The results indicated that the cotton rat species, S. hispidus and S. fulviventer, were not a useful model for either SARS-CoV infection or disease. This observation was supported by the absence of any signs of illness, the failure to consistently demonstrate virus in the blood and tissues, and the absent of any notable histopathology. However, infected animals were capable of producing neuralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV, suggesting the seroconversion did occur. Further studies are warranted to consider other animal species in efforts to find better animal models for the evaluation of SARS-CoV vaccines and antiviral drugs.

            "text": "S INCE THE OUTBREAK OF SEVERE acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during 2002-2003, a global research effort has been underway to establish a suitable animal species for modeling human disease (Peiris et al. 2003) . Several laboratory animal species have been shown to support the replication of the causative agent, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), but disease similar to that reported in humans was not seen (Roberts et al. 2008 , Tseng et al. 2007 , McCray et al. 2007 . Although these models have proven useful for studying the pathogenesis and for evaluating anti-viral drugs and vaccines, the idea model would be a single suitable animal species (Tseng et al. 2007 ). Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate two species of cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus and Sigmodon fulviventer) with the aim of finding a better model for SARS-CoV infection and human-like SARS disease. Cotton rats (S. hispidus) have been documented as a suitable model for other respiratory viral diseases, they can be obtained from commercial sources, and reagents are available for study of the immune response (Niewiesk and Prince 2002 , Ottolini et al. 2005 , Blanco et al. 2004 ).",

The cotton rats purchased from Virion Systems were certified to be seronegative for adventitious viruses. The animals were housed in large polycarbonate cages, fed a diet of standard rodent chow and water, and used at 6-12 weeks of age. Cotton rats in this age-range weighed approximately 100-150 g; they were matched by age and weight for use in different groups. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane for all manipulations, and sacrificed by isoflurane asphyxiation for the collection of tissue samples.

Stocks were prepared by passaging the virus twice in Vero E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.001 (passage 4) and the titer was expressed as the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 )/mL. The stock virus was aliquoted and stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C until used the experiments. In addition to using the stock virus as the inoculum for infecting animals and in the neutralization test, a separate aliquot was titrated each time blood and tissue samples were tested to serve as a control for verifying that the infectivity assay was performing properly.

Specimens from controls animals, including the lung did not show any pathology, nor was there any evidence of viral specific staining in any of the tissues. Although virus was recovered from nasal wash samples and from the lung of one animal, it is likely that the low titers represented residual virus inoculum because of the failure to demonstrate detectable virus in any of the tissues. In addition, that the animals did not become infected was supported by the absence of SARS-CoV neutralizing in blood samples taken from five animals on day 22 P.I.

Signs of illness were not observed for any of the animals and none lost weight during the experiment. Attempts to detect virus in the nasal wash and blood samples taken from each animal using Vero E6 tissue cultures were unsuccessful. Although the lung histology revealed a very mild interstitial pneumonia in four of six animals sacrificed on days 4 and 7 P.I., all lung tissue samples, as well as tissue samples derived from the heart, liver spleen and kidney of the animals were negative for virus by IHC staining and by assay in Vero cells. The reason for the mild pathology in infected animals is unknown since specimens from controls animals, including the lung, did not show either pathology or viral antigens in any of the tissues. However, blood from each of five animals taken on day 22 P.I. were positive for neutralizing antibody with the titers ranging from 1:40 to 1:160, and the samples from the control animals were antibody negative. These findings confirmed our previous observation that S. fulviventer appeared susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV infection but it must have been mild and transient",

Since the health status of these animals was suspect and there was no evidence of infection, no more experiments were performed with animals derived from the UTMB colony. Therefore, a second experiment was performed with commercially purchased S. hispidus. Likewise, neutralizing antibody was not detected on day 21 post-exposure to 10 6 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV, thus indicating that this species was not susceptible to infection using this dose of virus. In contrast, in two subsequent experiments, S. fulviventer became infected following exposure to the same dose of virus as indicated by the detection of antibody in animals on day 21 postexposure to virus. Even though infection was demonstrated, none of the animals showed signs of illness, nor was there any conclusive evident of viral replication in selected tissues. The reason for the difference in susceptibility of the two species to SARS-CoV is unknown. The sex and age of the two species was the same. While the generation of the animals could have differed, the possible influence, if any, on susceptibility is unknown.",

In addition, in our more recent studies to characterize other strains of transgenic mice that did not develop a fatal infection, weight loss was a consistent indicator of SARS-CoV infection (Tseng et al., 2007) . Others have reported weight loss to be a clinical outcome of SARS-CoV in infected inbred mice (Roberts et al. 2008) . Although weight loss is a reliable indicator of SARS-CoV infection in some mice, these results may not be applicable to cotton rats. For example, cotton rats are excellent models of respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV), but infec-tion with these viruses does not result in a loss of weight. Thus, weight loss must be interpreted with caution because of the possibility of the response variation among mammalian species.",

The detection of virus early after exposure was believed to reflect residual viral inoculum because of the sporadic pattern and low titers of the virus. However, low-level viral replication cannot be excluded because the detection level of the cell culture assay is about 100 TCID50. Nevertheless, because of the lack of any clinical signs of illness and the absence of any confirmed viral induced pathology in the tissues, S. fulviventer was not considered to warrant any further evaluations as a potential model for SARS-CoV infection. Overall, our efforts involving both S. hispidus and S. fulviventer did not yield a useful model for either infection or disease. This observation was supported by the absence of any signs of illness, the failure to demonstrate virus in the tissues consistently, and the absence of any confirmed virus induced histopathology. In addition, SARS-CoV antibody was not detected in S. hispidus as evidence that this species was not susceptible to infection. However, more recent data indicate that other strains of SARS-CoV, serially passaged virus, or the use of aged animals offer alternative approaches for providing better animal models to evaluate SARS-CoV vaccines and antiviral drugs (Roberts et al. 2008) .",
