            "text": "This work describes the design, synthesis, and evaluation of low-molecular weight peptidic SARS-CoV 3CL protease inhibitors. The inhibitors were designed based on the potent tripeptidic Z-Val-Leu-Ala(pyrrolidone-3-yl)-2-benzothiazole (8; K i \u00bc 4.1 nM), in which the P3 valine unit was substituted with a variety of distinct moieties. The resulting series of dipeptide-type inhibitors displayed moderate to good inhibitory activities against 3CL pro . In particular, compounds 26m and 26n exhibited good inhibitory activities with K i values of 0.39 and 0.33 mM, respectively. These low-molecular weight compounds are attractive leads for the further development of potent peptidomimetic inhibitors with pharmaceutical profiles. Docking studies were performed to model the binding interaction of the compound 26m with the SARS-CoV 3CL protease. The preliminary SAR study of the peptidomimetic compounds with potent inhibitory activities revealed several structural features that boosted the inhibitory activity: (i) a benzothiazole warhead at the S1 0 position, (ii) a g-lactam unit at the S1-position, (iii) an appropriately hydrophobic leucine moiety at the S2-position, and (iv) a hydrogen bond between the N-arylglycine unit and a backbone hydrogen bond donor at the S3-position.",

            "text": "Since its first appearance in Southern China in late 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been recognized as a global threat [1, 2] . Its rapid and unexpected spread to 32 countries has affected more than 8000 individuals and caused nearly 800 (w10%) fatalities worldwide within a few months [1e3] . The causative SARS pathogen is a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV [4, 5] . SARS-CoV is a positive-strand RNA virus with a genome sequence that is only moderately homologous to other known coronaviruses [6, 7] . SARS-CoV encodes a chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ), also referred to as the main protease (M pro ), which plays a pivotal role in processing viral polyproteins and controlling replicase complex activity [8] . This enzyme is indispensable for viral replication and infection processes, making it an ideal target for the design of antiviral therapies. The 3CL pro active site contains a catalytic dyad in which a cysteine residue (Cys145) acts as a nucleophile and a histidine (His41) residue acts as a general acid or base [9, 10] . The SARS epidemic was successfully controlled in 2003; however, the potential reemergence of pandemic SARS-CoV continues to pose a risk, and new strains of SARS could potentially be more virulent than the strains that contributed to the 2003 outbreak. Since 2003, two additional human coronaviruses, NL63 and HKU1, have been identified in patients around the world [11, 12] . Recently, a new SARS-like virus, HCoV-EMC, was identified in at least two individuals, one of whom died [13] . Very recently, the first case of a fatal respiratory illness similar to the deadly SARS was confirmed in Britain [14] . The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that it is closely monitoring the situation and is working to \"ensure a high degree of preparedness, should the new virus be found to be sufficiently transmissible to cause a community outbreak\". There is a significant need to develop anti-SARS agents that are capable of treating this potentially fatal respiratory illness. Several reports of crystalline forms of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro protein bound to hexapeptidyl chloromethyl ketone inhibitors have been reported [6, 9] , and numerous peptidic structures have been reported in the context of targeted antiviral drug design [15e22] . The reported protease inhibitors are generally peptidic in nature, often five to three residues in length, and bear a reactive warhead group at the C-terminus which forms an interaction with the protease catalytic Cys145 (Fig. 1, 1e9) . Two of these compounds (8 and 9) , recently described in a separate report from our group [22] , exhibited excellent potent inhibitory activities with K i values of 4.1 and 3.1 nM, respectively. These peptidic inhibitors provided valuable insight into the design constraints for this system and quickly led to the development of nonpeptidic small molecule inhibitors (Fig. 1, 10e17) [23e30]. These small molecular inhibitors generally showed moderate to good activities.",

In a first attempt, the P3 valine region was removed and the P4benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) in 8 was replaced with a series of small moieties with sizes similar to that of the P3 valine group in 8. The inhibitory activities of the resulting dipeptidic compounds bearing a valine mimic, isopentanoyl (25a; K i \u00bc 5.9 mM) or tert-butoxy carbonyl (25b; K i \u00bc 23 mM), were dramatically reduced compared to the activity of 8 (K i \u00bc 0.0041 mM) [22] ; however, the introduction of Cbz (25c; K i and IC 50 \u00bc 0.46 and 21.0 mM) as a P3 moiety resulted in a 12-fold or 50-fold activity increase for 25a or 25b, respectively, although the potency was reduced relative to the value for the tripeptidic lead 8. This result suggested that the Cbz group, which was introduced in place of the P3 scaffold in the dipeptidic 25c, conveyed appreciable activity; therefore, compound 25c could serve as a lead for further optimization steps. By retaining the P3 Cbz moiety in 25c, we examined the relevance of the leucine residue (or isobutyl unit) for P2 substrate selectivity in comparison with a variety of its congeners. Accordingly, a series of isosteres was introduced, including n-butyl (25d; K i \u00bc 1.60 mM), isopropyl (25e; K i \u00bc 1.71 mM), sec-butyl (25f; K i \u00bc 29.0 mM), 3-methyl(thio)ethyl (25g; K i \u00bc 9.40 mM), and benzyl (25h; K i \u00bc 1.20 mM). The compounds bearing n-butyl (25d), isopropyl (25e), or benzyl (25h) groups exhibited reasonable inhibitory activities, although the potencies were reduced by a factor of 3e4 relative to the value for 25c. The inhibitory activity of the compound bearing sec-butyl (25f) or 3-methyl(thio)ethyl (25g) was severely reduced compared to the activity of 25c. Therefore, the leucine residue (or isobutyl group) was more selective and appropriate as a P2 group in 25c, providing enhanced inhibitory activity.",

Therefore, we introduced a series of aryloxyacetyls, including phenoxyacetyl (26h; K i and IC 50 \u00bc 0.56 and 24 mM), 4-methoxyphenoxyacetyl (26i; K i \u00bc 1.56 mM), 4hydroxyphenoxyacetyl (26j; K i \u00bc 8.4 mM), and 3-dimethyl aminophenoxyacetyl (26k; K i \u00bc 0.84 mM) as P3 groups in place of the Cbz group in 25c. Compounds 26h and 26k exhibited comparable activities to 25c; however, the other derivatives (26i and 26j) displayed reduced inhibitory activities relative to the lead compound 25c. These results suggested that the introduction of an aryloxyacetyl P3 group in the dipeptidic 25c did not appreciably improve the inhibitory activity against 3CL pro . We also introduced several N-arylglycyls, including N-(4-methoxyphenyl)glycyl (26l; K i \u00bc 3.20 mM), N-(3-methoxyphenyl)glycyl (26m; K i and IC 50 \u00bc 0.39 and 10.0 mM), and N-(2-methoxyphenyl)glycyl (26n; K i and IC 50 \u00bc 0.33 and 14.0 mM). The results of these studies revealed that compounds 26m and 26n displayed relatively potent inhibitory activities compared to the lead 25c. The compound bearing an N-(2-methoxyphenyl)glycyl (26n) was identified as the most potent inhibitor in the present study. This result suggested that the hydrogen bonding properties of the amino group on the N-arylglycyl moiety might have contributed to the improvement in activity (see Fig. 2B ).",

We examined the molecular docking of the potent active compound 26m in comparison with docking of the tripeptidic 9 and a structurally similar ligand, the docking structure of which has been elucidated previously by X-ray crystallography (PDB ID: 1WOF, [35] . Several minimization processes were performed using the MMFF94X force field to model the solvation environment surrounding the inhibitor. A molecular simulation was then performed. As shown in Fig. 2A , the P1 0 eP2 moieties in 26m, in the tripeptidic compound 9, and in the original ligand interacted with the same region of the protease. Interestingly, the aminoacetyl group on the N-(3-methoxyphenyl)glycyl group in 26m mimicked the P3 valine moieties of the tripeptidomimetic 9 and the reported ligand. The interactions of compound 26m with the protein are described in detail in Fig. 2B . Particularly, a notable hydrogen bonding involved between the amino group (eNH) of P3 N-(3-methoxyphenyl)glycine with a backbone amino acid residue Glu166 of 3CL pro was observed to have relatively potent inhibition than other inhibitors presented in the study against SARS-CoV 3CL pro . The essential nature of this hydrogen bond will be explored in further optimization studies of dipeptide-type SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors.",

In a preliminary study, the compound 25c, bearing a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) P3 moiety, was identified as a lead compound. The P3 moiety in 25c was systematically modified with a view to improve the biological activity. This study led to the identification of a compound bearing an N-arylglycyl as a P3 moiety as having higher inhibitory activity due to the presence of a hydrogen bond with the backbone amino acid residue Glu166 of 3CL pro . Leucine and benzothiazole units were identified as appropriate P2 and P1 0 moieties, respectively, in 25c. Accordingly, compounds 26m and 26n were recognized as potent inhibitors in the present study. These potent dipeptidic inhibitors provide attractive leads, which are undergoing further structural modifications in an effort to improve the pharmaceutical profiles. These processes are underway and will be reported in the near future.",

After evaporating the solvent under reduced pressure, the corresponding deprotected lactam residue (0.100 g, 0.53 mmol) was coupled to the carboxylic acid 20a (0.136 g, 0.38 mmol) using the coupling agent HBTU (0.147 g, 0.38 mmol) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (0.050 mL, 0.38 mmol) in DMF (3 mL) at 0 C. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 2e3 h under ambient conditions. The solvent was then evaporated under a high vacuum, and the residue was dissolved in EtOAc (50 mL). The organic layer was washed with 5% citric acid (20 mL \u00c2 2), 5% NaHCO 3 (20 mL \u00c2 2), and brine (25 mL).

Initially, a binding model of 26m with 3CL pro was simulated to form the basis of a comparison with our previous potent lead tripeptidomimetic 9 and a substrate analog, using molecular operating environment (MOE) software. Several minimization processes were performed using the MMFF94X force field to model the solvation environment surrounding the inhibitor. Structures having a relatively low binding free energy and a high number of cluster members were selected for the subsequent docking conformation optimization step.
