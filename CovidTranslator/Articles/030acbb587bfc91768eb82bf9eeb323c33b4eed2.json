Little evidence exists to suggest that either group B or F streptococci are frequent or important causes of pharyngitis. 6, 7 The genetic heterogeneity of Lancefield groups C and G streptococci probably has contributed to the lack of consensus on the role(s) of these bacteria as causes of endemic pharyngitis. Lancefield group C streptococci are distinguished morphologically as being large or small colony formers. 8-1~ Large-colony [3-hemolytic group C streptococci are identified as Streptococcus equi. There are three subspecies (ssp) within S equi: equi, equisimilis, and zooepidemicus. 8-w Neither S equi ssp equi nor S equi ssp zooepidemicus is recovered frequently from human sources. However, the latter subspecies has caused human infections after ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products, and many patients identified in these outbreaks developed glomeru-lonephritisP , 4 In contrast, S equi ssp equisimilis regularly is recovered from humans. There are also small-and large-colony [3-hemolytic group G streptococci. Of interest, S equi ssp equisimilis and human biotypes of large-colony {3-hemolytic group G streptococci are closely related. 6 Among the small-colony group C [3-hemolytic bacteria, S anginosus is also recovered frequently from humans. 6-l~ Most of the initial evaluations of the roles of groups C and G beta-hemolytic streptococci as causes of pharyngitis did not differentiate among the various species and subspecies found in these groups. In a study that did not speciate strains of group C streptococci, Hayden et al reported similar rates of groups C and G streptococci recovered from the throats of children with pharyngitis (mean age 11 years) compared with cultures obtained from healthy age-matched controls? 1 Recovery of these strains occurred more frequently in older children and adolescents, however. In addition, these investigators reported an increased rate of recovery and group C (but not group G) streptococci from college students with pharyngitis compared with similarly aged controls observed for noninfectious problems.12 Patients with pharyngitis caused by group C streptococci experienced an illness similar to that caused by GABHS. They were more likely to have fever, headache, tonsillar exudate, and anterior cervical adenopathy than were symptomatic students whose cultures were negative for [3-hemolytic streptococci.",

Cimolai et al performed a case-control study of children older than 2 years of age with clinical evidence of pharyngitis. 6 Although differences in the rates of recovery of groups C and G streptococci were not appreciated between patients and controls, a trend towards significance was noted when results from the geneticallyrelated S equi spp equisimilis and large-colony strains of Group G were combined. This difference became significant when the comparison was limited to moderate or heavy growth (2+, 3+) of these streptococci. In contrast, they did not find differences between cases and controls in the rates of recovery of Group C S anginosus or other nonGroup A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Accordingly, these investigators suggested that a heavy growth of either of the closely related species of S equi spp equisimilis or beta-hemolytic group G streptococci may be associated with clinical pharyngitis in children, whereas other [3hemolytic streptococci were unlikely to cause clinical disease.",

However, because the organism persists in the throat of infected individuals for weeks to months after infection, asymptomatic children with positive cultures may have had an episode of pharyngitis caused by Mpneumoniae in the recent past. Because the authors could not eliminate this possibility, they were unwilling to dismiss it as a potential cause of pharyngitis. Additional evidence that Mpneumoniae is a cause of pharyngitis comes from the Huovinin study in which this organism was identified in 9% of symptomatic patients. 22 Unfortunately, no control population was used in this study.",

Bronchiolitis, croup, and pneumonia are observed less frequently. 24 One relatively characteristic result suggestive of adenoviral infection is the association of pharyngitis with conjunctivis, known as pharyngoconjunctival fever.

Sumaya et al found that 64 of 113 children diagnosed with EBVassociated mononucleosis were less than 6 years of age. 26 Approximately 50% of both older and younger patients presented with exudative pharyngitis. The constellation of symptoms associated with EBV disease was similar in children less than 4 years of age compared with older children, except that younger patients were more likely to have hepatosplenomegaly, mucopurulent nasal discharge, and a rash. 26 The diagnosis may be missed in the younger child because the heterophile response is decreased in children under 4 years of age. 27 The diagnosis can be confirmed by a panel of specific EBV serologic tests. 27 Recent studies have failed to show any benefit of treatment of EBVassociated mononucleosis with oral acyclovir alone or in combination with steroids. 28, 29 HIV HIV recently has been recognized to cause pharyngitis as part of the acute retroviral syndrome. Fever and pharyngitis have been identified as the primary sign of HIV infection in a cluster of cases of HIV that were linked by sexual contact. 3~ In addition to the symptom of pharyngitis, patients experiencing the acute retroviral syndrome often develop an illness that mimics infectious mononucleosis. 23 The significance of recognizing this syndrome may be the opportunity to provide antiretroviral therapy before the dissemination of HIV within the body.",

            "text": ",17 Production of hemolysis is inferior when the organism is grown on sheep's blood agar. The presence of colonies ofA haemolyticum should be suspected by recognition of a black opaque dot that can be observed if the colony is scraped away after 48 hours of growth) 5 To date, routine culturing for the presence ofA haern@ticum for patients with phar~aagitis is not recommended, and infected patients are ~ikely to be missed by standard throat culture techniques. The necessity of treating pharyngitis caused byA haemolyticure is unproven. However, antimicrobial therapy is said to be associated with a shortened duration of clinical illness, ms In vitro susceptibility tests have shown A haenu)~ttcum to be susceptible to penicillin and eLythromycin, as well as a number of other agents. Nonetheless, treatment of suspected cases of pharyngitis caused byA haemolyticum should be undertaken with erythromycin, as there have been reports of clinical failure and in vitro tolerance when penicillin has been used.18 Chlamydia and Mycoplasma Komaroff et al have suggested an etiological role for Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasrna pneumoniae in cases of pharyngitis in adults) 9 Using serological evidence as the basis of diagnosis, these investigators reported that approximately 20% and 10% of 763 adults with phar~aagitis had a four-fold rise in antibodies against C trachomatis and M pneumoniae, respectively. However, subsequent studies have failed to confirm this observation. McMillan and colleagues performed a case-control study of the causes of phar}nagitis in school-age children (4 to 18 years). 2~ The etiological diagnosis was based on cultures performed forM pneumoniae, C trachomatis, and respiratocy viruses. The investigators did not recover a single positive culture for C trachomatis from any of 302 children with sore throat nor from any of 308 healthy controls. Similarly, Gerber et at. did not recover a single positive culture for C trachomatis from 95 college students with acute phansngitis. ~l Huovenin and colleagues also evaluated the role of Chlamydia and Mycoplasma in pharyngitis in adults by culture and serology. 22 Similar to the studies of McMillian and Reed, none of 106 patients was found to have evidence of C trachomatis. However, 9 patients had serological evidence of infection with Cpneumoniae, supporting the possibility that this agent may be a cause of pharyngitis.",
