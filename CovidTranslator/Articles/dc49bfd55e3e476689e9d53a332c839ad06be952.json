Because various infection agents are associated with STIs, and because infected persons sometimes show no symptoms, the diagnosis of STIs using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) has required not only simultaneous multi-targeting, but also sensitive detection. Here, we compare microarray and real-time PCR for the detection of three common STIs agents, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Chlamydia trachomatis, using human urine samples. The detection results showed that microarray and real-time PCR technology are both effective tools for the detection of STI agents. In conclusion, real-time PCR detection offers more sensitivity and specificity than microarray, because of the quantitative method employed. But, microarray offers better performance, in terms of highthroughput and simultaneous multi-targeting.",

The conventional PCR method is a simple and fast diagnostic technique, and can multiplex. But the analysis of amplification must be accompanied by an electrophoresis step, and this additional experimental procedure causes contamination by aerosol of the amplicon 7 . A line probe assay can be simultaneously analyzed for various targets, but as for PCR, is vulnerable to contamination. After PCR reaction of the target gene, the sequencing of amplicon can be analyzed at a high resolution level, and allows automation of the experimental procedure. However, sequencing methods have the disadvantage of a longer turnaround time (TAT) than other methods 8 .

In the DNA extraction process, we employed an automated extraction system to minimize contamination, and then the same quantity of extracted DNA samples were applied to detect STIs using a During 2000, about 18.9 million people in the United States were infected by STI agents 10 . Various pathogens, such as bacterial, virus and parasite, were related to STIs. For early diagnosis of these infection agents, To detect hybridization results, a 3\u2032 end of the reverse primer for target gene amplification was labeled with CY3 fluorescent dye, and scanned using a Genepix 4000B microarray scanner. many diagnostics, including culture 11 , immunoassay 12 , and NAATs 13 , have been developed and applied. In this study, we compared microarray and real-time PCR techniques using urine specimens. Three common pathogens, U. urealyticum, M. genotalium, and C. trachomatis were applied for comparison with two NAATs. U. urealyticum is part of normal flora in the genital tract, and a recognized cause of urethritis. U. urealyticum includes two biovars and several serotypes, and because of commensal microbes, it is difficult to determine the pathogenic role of other U. urealyticum species 14 . To solve this difficulty, various target genes, 16s rRNA, 16S-23S rRNA, urease, and multiple-banded antigen (MBA), have been applied to detection 15 . M. genitalium has the smallest genome of about 580 kb, and is a recognized cause of urethritis, cervictis and endometrictis. From previous findings, traditional detection methods, such as culture and serology, have sometimes failed 16 . Therefore, a more sensitive diagnostic procedure was developed, and its clinical usefulness verified. C. trachomatis is a gram-negative bacteria and obligate intracellular pathogen. C. trachomatis is a common bacterial STI, and about 150 million new infections occur every year. C. trachomatis is divided into three biovars, and each biovar has unique clinical features, such as trachoma, urethritis, conjunctivitis, and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). Because of this obligate intracellular feature, an analysis method that uses culture is not a proper way to detect infection.",

Also, an automated printing process can fabricate high-density microarrays, and hundreds of thousands of targets are possible. STIs often cause co-infection, and have no symptom. Therefore, an accurate and multi-targeted detection method is needed. Microarray has many advantages in this respect. First, as various pathogens are related to STIs, many probes can exactly identify one or more infectious agents. Second, in the case of co-infection, a microarray offers economic diagnosis, because only one reaction is needed for various infectious agents. Although only three STIs were accomplished in this The real-time PCR method offers quantitative analysis and a visual reaction process. Also, real-time PCR can be used to measure the degree of infection [18] [19] [20] . Analysis based on C T in the experiment can detect simply and rapidly, using computer programs and a closedtube system to minimize the risk of carryover contamination from the amplicon. Because the primer has been designed considering the amplification efficiency, a real-time PCR method can detect low copy infection. This advantage is ideal for the early diagnosis of STIs.",

Prior to experiment, we confirmed the performance of each diagnostic kit using the positive materials provided. In the case of microarray, U. urealyticum, U. parvum, M. genitalium, and C. trachomatis DNA materials were applied(Figure 1). The performance of the real-time PCR kit was checked by cloned DNA that included the respective target regions of STI agents. Also, internal positive controls (IPC) and partial cloned DNA of a tobacco mosaic virus were added to confirm the performance of reaction composition, and gave valid results in all reactions(Figure 4). A total of 14 urine samples represented U. urealyticum positive results in microarray and the real-PCR reaction(Figures 2 and 3). However, one sample (UU05) showed a close to cut-off value (of signal intensity 500), and is possibly a false negative result(Figure 3). When based on the CT value in realtime reaction, the UU5 sample was confirmed as a low positive result.
