Here we identify the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein as a previously unrecognized component of the IFN response. IFN stimulates an association between PLZF, the promyelocytic leukemia protein and histone deacetylase 1, to induce a decisive subset of IFNstimulated genes (ISGs). Consequently, PLZF-deficient mice have a specific ISG defect and as a result are more susceptible to viral infection. This susceptibility correlates with a marked decrease in the expression of the key antiviral mediators and an impaired IFN-mediated induction of natural killer cell function. These results provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of IFN signaling and the induction of innate antiviral immunity.",

ISGs subsequently influence multiple pathways involved in cell stress responses, apoptosis, and proliferation, and mediate diverse immune effects (Goh et al., 1999; Goodbourn et al., 2000) . The potent immune response elicited by IFNs is exemplified by the establishment of an antiviral state that enabled their original discovery (Isaacs et al., 1957) . This state relies on the induction and activation of numerous intrinsic *Correspondence: These authors contributed equally to this work antiviral factors, most notably the Mx GTPases, the 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate-synthetase (OAS) system, ISG15, and protein kinase R (PKR) (Sadler and Williams, 2008) . In addition, IFNs modulate distinct aspects of both innate and adaptive immunity, affecting the activities of macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and T cells by enhancing ISG expression profiles, cell differentiation, cell trafficking, and antigen presentation. Due to the numerous effects of IFNs, they have been used therapeutically against a variety of diseases, including viral infections, immunomodulatory disorders, and hematological and solid tumors (Borden et al., 2007) . The factors determining the outcome of IFN treatment, however, are not understood and IFN therapy has had variable success. Although the essential JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway is well characterized, recent studies have revealed greater complexity in patterns of gene induction than initially envisaged (Chang et al., 2004; Tenoever et al., 2007; van Boxel-Dezaire et al., 2006) . Here we identify a novel IFN-mediated signal that leads to activation of the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) transcription factor that has fundamental consequences for the immune response.",

            "text": "To determine the factors contributing to IFN sensitivity, two renal cancer cell lines, differing markedly in their response to IFN (Holko and Williams, 2006) , were analyzed for their ISG profiles. Higher and more persistent expression of a subset of ISGs was noted in the IFNsensitive RCC1 cells when compared with the relatively IFN-insensitive ACHN cells ( Figure  1A ). Correspondingly, RCC1 cells showed an increased IFN-mediated antiviral response ( Figure S1 ). No differences in established IFN-regulatory factors were apparent between the two cell lines (Holko and Williams, 2006) . Therefore, to account for the differential regulation of this subset of ISGs, we analyzed the promoter proximal regions (1000 bp upstream of the ATG) for features that distinguished these genes from other ISGs that were synchronous between the two cell lines. It was found that genes differentially induced by IFN\u03b1 treatment in the RCC1 cells exhibited an over-representation of DNA binding motifs for the PLZF protein (Table S1 ). Cluster analysis showed the putative PLZF-binding sites were in proximity to sites occupied by essential STAT and IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), increasing the likelihood that these motifs were biologically relevant ( Figure S2 ). To test this correlation between expression of ISGs with putative binding motifs and expression levels of the transcription factor, both cell lines were assessed for their level of PLZF by Western blot analysis. Consistent with a role for PLZF in the IFN response, the IFN-sensitive RCC1 cells expressed higher levels of PLZF than the relatively IFN-insensitive ACHN cells ( Figure 1B ). This correlation between IFN sensitivity and expression levels of PLZF was further investigated using a monocytic U937 cell line stably transformed with a tetracycline-inducible PLZF-expressing construct (U937T:PLZF45) (McConnell et al., 2003) . The ISG expression profile of U937T:PLZF45 cells with and without tetracycline and IFN\u03b1 were examined.",

Remarkably, plzf -/-MEFs showed 100-fold lower IFN-mediated protection to infection with Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) than wild type MEFs (Figures 2A and S3 ). The role of PLZF in the in vivo IFNmediated anti-viral response was assessed by infectious challenge of plzf -/and wild type neonatal mice. Mice were infected with SFV at 10-times the half-maximal tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) and resistance to the virus measured as survival after infection. The survival curve of infected plzf -/mice closely parallels the wild type, with all mice of both genotypes dead by 3.5 days after infection (P>0.05). Appropriately, IFN pre-treatment of mice for 6 hours before exposure to SFV afforded significant protection to wild type mice, with 60% of infected neonates (18 of 30) surviving past 22 days. In contrast, IFN pre-treatment did not protect the plzf -/mice from SFV infection, with no survival beyond 6 days after infection ( Figure 2B ). Viral loads in the organs from plzf -/and wild type neonatal mice were measured 48 h after infection with SFV. Consistent with the survival results, viral titers in the organs of plzf -/mice, including the lung, thymus, spleen, heart and liver, were up to 1,000-fold higher than their wild type littermates ( Figure 2C ).",

The expression profile of a number of PLZF-dependent ISGs, identified in array experiments ( Figure 1A , 1C, and Table S2 ), was investigated ex vivo and in vivo. Significantly, the induction of the antiviral gene oas1 by IFN was impaired in primary plzf -/bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) ( Figure 3B ). As OAS1 is an established effector for the antiviral action of IFN, specifically against SFV (Borden et al., 2007; Pestka et al., 1987) , we measured its expression in different organs following IFN treatment and SFV infection. The induction of oas1 was significantly impaired in splenocytes isolated from the plzf -/mice ( Figure 3C-E) . Similarly, the antiviral ISGs rsad2 (also termed cig5 or viperin) and ifit2 (or ifi54) were impaired in plzf -/-BMMs ( Figure 3B ) and splenocytes (data not shown), or SFV-infected organs from plzf -/mice ( Figure 3C -E) . In keeping with the specificity of the PLZF response, expression of the PLZF-independent, but IFN-regulated CCL5 (RANTES) transcript was not affected ( Figure 3B ). This data suggests that the increased susceptibility of plzf -/mice is due to a specific defect in the induction of antiviral genes.",

Both IFIT1 and IFIT2 are strongly induced by IFN and virus, and are impaired in STAT1-deficient mice. These two genes are reported to have contrasting expression patterns in different tissues (Terenzi et al., 2007) . Both genes contain ISRE binding sites in their promoter, but there is no PLZF binding motif in the IFIT1 promoter. Accordingly, ifit2 induction was lost in the absence of PLZF, while ifit1 was still induced by IFN in plzf -/mice ( Figure 3F ). Furthermore, analysis of the expression of PLZF in different tissues showed a strong correlation between PLZF levels and ifit2 induction in response to IFN ( Figure 3F) . Hence, the different expression patterns of these two related ISGs likely depends upon their separate regulation by PLZF. Although, expression of IFIT1 is largely independent of PLZF, a degree of PLZF dependence is noted in the lung of mice suggesting that PLZF might still contribute indirectly to inducer-specific ISG regulation.",

However, analysis of PLZF expression in immune cells using the human and mouse microarray database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez) revealed that PLZF was also expressed in human NK cells ( Figure S4 ). Furthermore, we demonstrated that PLZF was expressed in mouse NK cells by sorting different spleen lymphocyte populations using FACS (NK1.1 + CD3 -) followed by gene expression analysis ( Figure 4A ). This analysis shows comparatively little expression in CD3 + NK1.1 -T cells and no detectable transcript in B cells. Consequently, we investigated the effect of the loss of PLZF on NK cell function. FACS analysis of splenocytes showed there were equivalent numbers of NK cells in wild type and plzf -/mice, with NK cells constituting 2-3% of total splenocytes ( Figure 4B ). The effector function of NK cells from wild type and plzf -/mice was investigated by testing their cytolytic activity against the NK-sensitive target cell line YAC-1 Shey and Ballas, 2008) . Following treatment with poly(I:C), which activates NK cells through the IFN\u03b1 signaling pathway, plzf -/-NK cells were impaired in their ability to spontaneously lyse YAC-1 cells ( Figure 4C , top panel). Moreover, when activated in vivo with IFN\u03b1, the ability of plzf -/-NK cells to subsequently lyse YAC-1 target cells was also markedly impaired ( Figure  4C , bottom panel). These results demonstrate that PLZF is required for NK cell effector function and also suggest that PLZF may regulate the expression of target genes involved in NK cytolytic activity. As cytokine-induced activation of NK cells results in a dramatic increase in the expression of Granzyme B (GzmB), we examined the ability of poly(I:C) and IL-2 to induce GzmB protein expression in murine splenic NK cells. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with poly(I:C) or PBS, and splenic NK cells were analyzed after 24 hours for GzmB expression by FACS. Wild type spleens of poly(I:C) injected mice had a markedly higher percentage of NK cells positive for GzmB than spleens of plzf -/mice ( Figure 4D ). The reduced level of GzmB is consistent with a reduced ability to lyse target cells. Activation of NK cells in vitro with IL-2 induced equivalent amounts of GzmB in either genotype (data not shown). Therefore, the role of PLZF in the induction of GzmB is through IFN, rather than other cytokines.",

Treatment of U937T:PLZF45 cells with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D suggested that the induction of selected ISGs by PLZF is a primary transcriptional event ( Figure S5 ). Promoter regions from the PLZF-regulated transcripts, rsad2 and ifit2, were fused to luciferase and activity was measured following IFN treatment. Over-expression of PLZF in RCC1 or ACHN cells produced a dose-dependent induction of the reporter promoters. This effect was further enhanced by IFN\u03b1 treatment ( Figure 5 A-C). Correspondingly, induction of the rsad2 promoter was impaired in cells with PLZF expression reduced by RNA interference ( Figure 5D ). Reporter constructs confirm the requirement to colocate ISRE and PLZF-binding sites in the promoters of PLZF-regulated ISGs ( Figure S6 ). A direct association of PLZF with the promoters of rsad2 and ifit2 was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in the RCC1 and U937T:PLZF45 cell lines. Moreover, the association of PLZF to the rsad2 and ifit2 promoters was dramatically enhanced by IFN treatment ( Figures 5E and S7 ).",

            "text": "The observed IFN enhanced association of PLZF with select ISG promoters could occur through direct post-translational modification of PLZF, and/or modification of transcriptional cofactors. To investigate the former possibility, PLZF was immunoprecipitated from control and IFN\u03b1-treated U937T:PLZF45 cells and the acetylation or phosphorylation state of the protein was probed by Western blot. Although acetylation has been reported to be important for DNA-binding of PLZF (Guidez et al., 2004) , no change in the acetylation state was detected (data not shown). However, PLZF was found to be phosphorylated at serine and tyrosine residues, with tyrosine phosphorylation correlating with temporal treatment with IFN ( Figure  6A ). PLZF encodes two types of conserved domain, a BTB (bric \u00e1 brac, tramtrack, broad complex-poxvirus zinc finger) domain at the N-terminus and nine repeated zinc finger domains at the C-terminus. As BTB domains have been shown to be crucial for homodimerization and protein-protein interaction (Dong et al., 1996) , we chose to focus on residues within this domain. Through alignment of the amino acid sequence of PLZF with BTB domains from various other proteins and by analysis with prediction programs (NetPhos 2.0), several putative phosphorylated residues within the BTB domain of PLZF were identified along with residues previously shown to be crucial for PLZF to function as a transcriptional repressor (Figures S8-S10). Residues in PLZF were mutated to test their significance in the IFN\u03b1-mediated induction of the rsad2 promoter. This approach identified the tyrosine at position 88 and a serine residue at amino acid 76 to be important for induction of rsad2 ( Figure 6C ). Consistent with these promoter reporter assays, phosphorylation analysis of the full-length mutant protein (S76A) indicates that the residue at position 76 is the sole phospho-serine residue of significance in IFN-mediated activation ( Figure 6B ). Two additional mutations, R49D and L103E, that had previously been demonstrated to constitute important structural components on either surface of the BTB domain, had opposing effects upon ISG induction. As anticipated, the L103E mutation impaired activation of rsad2. Surprisingly, mutation of R49 induced the rsad2 reporter. While the structure of the charged pocket that surrounds the R49 residue had been demonstrated to be critical for PLZF to function as a transcriptional repressor, these results suggest that other residues of the BTB domain on the lateral surface, where L103 lies, may be more pertinent to the role of PLZF as a transcription inducer.",

Accordingly, we sought to measure IFN-induced changes in known PLZF cofactors. Transcriptional repression by PLZF is sensitive to inhibitors of deacetylation, and PLZF physically interacts with both class I and II histone deacetylases (HDACs) via the BTB domain (Ahmad et al., 1998; Chauchereau et al., 2004; David et al., 1998) . In accord with a requirement for HDAC activity for transcriptional activation of ISGs by PLZF, treatment of cells with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) blocked induction of selected ISGs in the PLZF-inducible U937T:PLZF45 cells or BMMs ( Figure 7A and B ). An association between the class I histone deacetylase HDAC1 and PLZF was shown by coimmunoprecipitation of over expressed FLAG-tagged PLZF in HEK293 cells. Notably, an association with the class II histone deacetylase HDAC4 was not detected under the same conditions ( Figure 7C ). This association between PLZF and HDAC1 was confirmed with endogenous protein under more physiologically relevant conditions in primary BMMs ( Figure  7D ). As an additional measure of co-operation between PLZF and HDAC1, the effect of coexpressing PLZF and HDAC1 upon the rsad2 reporter was measured in IFN-responsive RCC1 cells. Appropriately, co-expression of PLZF with HDAC1 enhanced the induction of the ISG promoter by IFN\u03b1 above that observed with either protein expressed alone. Moreover, treatment with TSA blocked the additive effect of PLZF and HDAC1 ( Figure 7E ).",

Of relevance to this study, PML mediates the formation of nuclear bodies that are crucial in the IFN response. More directly, it has been established that the antiviral response is reduced in PML knockout MEFs (Day et al., 2004) . To determine whether PML is a cofactor in PLZF-mediated activation of ISGs, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed on lysates from the IFN-responsive HeLa cells, over-expressing PLZF-tagged constructs, or on endogenous PLZF from primary BMMs. PLZF was found to interact with PML in both cell types after IFN\u03b1 treatment (Figures 7F, 7G, S12, and S13). Importantly, PML has been demonstrated to alter the cellular location of PLZF (Koken et al., 1997) . To show whether the association between PLZF and PML, detected by immunoprecipitation, correlated with co-localization of the proteins within nuclear bodies, confocal microscopy with fluorescently tagged proteins was performed in RCC1 cells treated with or without IFN\u03b1. Indirect immunofluoresence confirms that PLZF localized with PML after IFN stimulation ( Figure 7H ). The reported induction of PML by IFN does not account for the observed co-localization, as the levels of PML did not significantly increase over the duration of this experiment ( Figure S14 ). Together these data show IFN treatment induces phosphorylation of PLZF, plausibly by JNK, and interaction with both HDAC1 and PML to mediate association of the complex with PLZF binding sites in gene promoters to induce specific ISGs.",

            "text": "Recent studies have shown that type I IFN signaling is more complex than initially recognized, activating different specific signals and patterns of gene expression (van Boxel-Dezaire et al., 2006) . The response via the canonical JAK-STAT pathway alone is not sufficient to explain all the biological effects of type I IFNs. Accordingly, other kinases, including PI3K and MAP kinase, lead to the activation of additional transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB, AP-1, IRFs and PU.1, which interact with STATs at interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) via ISGF3 or other IRFs to regulate ISGs. Our results show that the transcription factor PLZF is a novel regulator of the IFN response. We show PLZF induces a specific subset of ISGs with PLZFbinding sites in proximity to ISRE. Gene array, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and promoter reporter experiments demonstrate that PLZF directly occupies these select promoter sequences, and that this activity is IFN dependent. In this study, analysis of all genes induced by PLZF shows a predominance of ISGs, explicitly implicating PLZF in positively modulating the IFN pathway.",

The mechanism for transcriptional repression by PLZF is thought to involve constraint of the accessibility of the gene to transcriptional machinery, via chromatin remodeling by acetlyation involving the nuclear corepressor complex (NCoR) and HDACs, particularly HDACs 1 and 4 (Chauchereau et al., 2004; David et al., 1998; Guidez et al., 2004; Hong et al., 1997; McLoughlin et al., 2002) . While HDACs are generally considered as corepressors, Qui et al. (Qiu et al., 2006) showed that HDAC1 served as a coactivator for the glucocorticoid receptor. More relevant to our findings, we and others found that inhibition of HDAC1 perturbed IFN-induced transcription and antiviral responses. Moreover, data generated from HDAC1 knockout cells show that this protein is required for the efficient activation of ISGs (Chang et al., 2004; Zupkovitz et al., 2006) . Also, HDAC1 but not HDAC4 associated with STAT1 and STAT2 to positively activate expression of the ISG3-dependent transcriptional response. Correspondingly, we detect an association between PLZF and HDAC1, not HDAC4, upon stimulation with IFN\u03b1, leading us to propose that HDAC1 is key to PLZF's role as a transcriptional enhancer. Similarly to HDAC1, a second PLZF cofactor, PML, is indispensable for the IFN response (Handwerger and Gall, 2006) . Appropriately, PML is induced by IFN through an ISRE and an IFN-gamma activation site (GAS) motif in its promoter, and the number and intensity of nuclear bodies increase in response to IFN (Stadler et al., 1995) . More directly, it has been established that the antiviral response is reduced in PML knockout MEFs (Day et al., 2004) . We demonstrate here that PLZF and PML associate, and that this interaction is also modulated by IFN.",

            "text": "While the precise mechanism modulating the association between PLZF and its cofactors has not been established, it is predicted to be mediated by the BTB domain of PLZF (Melnick et al., 2000b) . This domain acts as a homodimerization motif that is essential for the repressor function of PLZF and its localization in nuclear bodies. (Melnick et al., 2000a) Our results suggest that this domain is also key for its transcriptional enhancer function. However, our observations indicate differences in how the BTB domain mediates repressor or enhancer activities of PLZF. Mutation of the residue at position 49 in the BTB domain of PLZF, shown to be essential for repressor activity, had the contradictory effect of further enhancing ISG expression. Mutation of another key structural residue, on the lateral face of the BTB domain at position 108, recapitulated the loss of function as a repressor. This implies that different regions of PLZF mediate repressor or enhancer functions. As we found an interaction between PLZF, PML and HDAC1 only following IFN stimulation, it seems likely that IFN signaling affects the state of one or all of these proteins. Informatively, the apparent paradoxical function of HDAC1 as a corepressor or coactivator appears to be regulated by acetylation of the protein itself (Melnick et al., 2000a) . It is also reported that PLZF is both acetylated and phosphorylated (Ball et al., 1999; Guidez et al., 2004) . In this study, PLZF was found to be phosphorylated at serine and tyrosine residues in response to IFN, and we identify a serine residue (Ser76) within the BTB domain of PLZF that is important for PLZF-mediated ISG induction, thereby implicating a serine kinase in PLZF activation. Accordingly, kinase inhibitor studies implicate the serine kinase JNK as a potential activator of PLZF.",

A direct comparison of PLZF-independent and -dependent genes demonstrates that tissue-specific expression patterns of the closely related ISGs IFIT1 and IFIT2 may be determined by PLZF ( Figure 3F ). We demonstrate that PLZF associates with other essential cofactors, PML and HDAC1.

            "text": "Although only a subset of ISGs is regulated by PLZF, the observed impairment is physiologically critical as it is sufficient to severely compromise the antiviral immune response. We present data that this immune impairment is due to direct defects in key IFNmediated antiviral factors, and to indirect mechanisms that modulate NK cell activity. The reduced viral load in the presence of PLZF and IFN suggests that IFN-improved survival after SFV infection requires PLZF. This correlates with regulation of the expression of the antiviral mediator OAS1. OAS1 combined with the ribonuclease L (RNaseL) constitutes an antiviral RNA decay pathway previously demonstrated to regulate SFV infection (Dong et al., 1996; Li et al., 1997) . Impaired induction of other ISGs such as IFIT2 and RSAD2, which have recently been shown to function as antiviral effectors, was also found (Borden et al., 2007) . Other ISGs identified as having impaired induction in plzf -/cells, most pertinently CXCL10, do not have a direct antiviral function. CXCL10 has been demonstrated, with other chemokines, to regulate NK cell function (Biron et al., 1999) . A recent study comparing wild type and CXCL10 -/mice has shown that CXCL10 expression promotes protection from coronavirusinduced neurological and liver disease (Walsh et al., 2007) . Furthermore, a study using CXCL9 -/and CXCL10 -/mice has found that these chemokines are critical for the control of Herpes Simplex Virus infection through mobilization of NK cells and CTL to sites of infection (Thapa et al., 2008) . IFN has an established role in the function of NK cells, and influences NK activation during viral infection. Defects in NK cell activity, such as decreased production of IFN, also render mice more susceptible to viral infection (Lee et al., 2007) . However, impaired NK cell function in plzf -/mice is independent of IFN production. Instead, we propose the observed defect in NK cell activity in the plzf -/mouse is due to impairment of specific ISGs, with CXCL10 identified as a likely candidate. PLZF-deficient mice show a marked decrease in CXCL10 expression in NK-cell-rich organs, which may lead to impaired mobility of NK cells, and therefore ineffective viral clearance. IFN-induced activation of NK cells resulted in potent cytotoxicity associated with a dramatic increase in GzmB. GzmB expression is essential to elicit NK cell cytotoxic function, and is responsible for the rapid induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Previous studies have demonstrated GzmB is an ISG Zimmerer et al., 2007) . However, the regulation of GzmB expression is not understood. Intriguingly, the GzmB promoter contains a binding site for PLZF, raising the possibility that PLZF directly regulates GzmB transcriptional. The findings here suggest that IFN-mediated activation of NK cells is regulated by PLZF.",

(A-C) Over-expression of PLZF in RCC1 and ACHN cells induces RSAD2 and IFIT2 promoter activity. Cells were co-transfected with a PLZF expression plasmid and RSAD2-Luc or IFIT2-Luc promoter reporter constructs, then treated with IFN\u03b1 (500 IU/ml of IFN\u03b11). The luciferase values were obtained in at least three independent experiments. (D) Western blot analysis of PLZF in RCC1 cells expressing targeted or control miRNA (top panel). Luciferase assay for RSAD2 promoter induction in RCC1 cells expressing miRNAs targeting PLZF (PLZF1.3 and PLZF2.4) or the control miRNA targeting LacZ (LacZ) then stimulated with IFN\u03b1 (bottom panel). Data are representative of three independent experiments (mean \u00b1 SD; A-D) . (E) Chromatin from PLZF-inducible U937T cells grown in the presence or absence of tetracycline (24 h) and IFN\u03b1 (1,000 U/ml for 6 or 24 h) was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. Promoters of RSAD2, IFIT2 and IFI15 were amplified from the immunoprecipitated chromatin using SYBR Green quantitative RT-PCR. Data was normalized to the 10% input and FLAG antibody samples, expressed as 2 -(PLZFCt-10% inputCt)-(FLAGCt-10% inputCt) . (B) Serine76 is required for PLZF phosphorylation in response to IFN. Hela cells were transiently transfected with wild-type (WT) FLAG-PLZF or various mutant PLZF expression plasmids, followed by IFN\u03b1 treatment, immunoprecipitated (IP) with the anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted (IB) with a phosphoserine or FLAG antibody, as indicated. (C) Luciferase assay for RSAD2 promoter induction in lysates of RCC1 cells transfected with wild type (WT) or indicated mutant PLZF expression plasmids, followed by stimulation with IFN\u03b1. The values obtained from at least three independent transfection experiments were normalized. (D,E) JNK inhibitor is sufficient to block PLZF-regulated RSAD2 promoter induction following IFN\u03b1 stimulation. (D) Hela cells were transfected with PLZF expression and RSAD2 promoter reporter plasmids. The cells were then either left untreated or were treated with inhibitors of ERK (5 \u03bcM PD98059), JNK (1 \u03bcM SP600125), p38 (2.5 \u03bcM SB203580), Src (1 \u03bcM AZD0530), PI3K (1 \u03bcM AS-252424) or JAK2 (0.5 \u03bcM JAK2 inhibitor II), followed by IFN\u03b1 stimulation for 8 h before measuring RSAD2 promoter reporter activity in cell lysates. (E) The inhibition of PLZF-dependent RSAD2 promoter activity by JNK inhibitor occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Data are representative of three independent experiments (mean \u00b1 SD; C-E).",
