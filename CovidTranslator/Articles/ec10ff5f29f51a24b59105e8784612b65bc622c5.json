Although the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has restricted cell tropism for cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, a non-macrophage cell MARC-145 was susceptible to PRRSV because of the expression of virus receptor CD163 on the cell surface, therefore MARC-145 cells is used as model cell for PRRSV studies. In order to determine if cholesterol is involved in PRRSV infection in MARC-145 cells, we used three pharmacological agents: methyl-b cyclodextrin (MbCD), mevinolin, and filipin complex to deplete cholesterol in MARC-145. Although these agents act by different mechanisms, they all significantly inhibited PRRSV infection. The inhibition could be prevented by addition of exogenous cholesterol. Cell membrane cholesterol depletion after virus infection had no effect on PRRSV production and cholesterol depletion pre-infection did not reduce the virus attachment, suggesting cholesterol is involved in virus entry. Further results showed that cholesterol depletion did not change expression levels of the PRRSV receptor CD163 in MARC-145, had no effect on clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but disturbed lipid-raft-dependent endocytosis. Collectively, these studies suggest that cholesterol is critical for PRRSV entry, which is likely to be mediated by a lipidraft-dependent pathway.",

Further results showed that cholesterol depletion did not change the expression level of CD163 on the surface of MARC-145 cells.

We used three pharmacological agents to deplete the cholesterol in the cell membrane. The results showed that cholesterol depletion decreased the infection in a dose-dependent manner, and replenishment of cholesterol could partially restore viral infection. When a marked effect of cholesterol depletion on PRRSV entry was observed, no influence was seen on either virus binding or at the post-entry stage. These results are similar to the findings observed on HCoV-229E, MHV and SARS-CoV, which are also members of the order Nidovirales [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

To determine if cholesterol depletion inhibited lipidraft-dependent endocytosis, uptake of FITC-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B was analyzed. In contrast to transferrin uptake, the localization of cholera toxin subunit B shifted from a mainly punctate cytoplasmic form to a predominantly plasma membrane location after treatment of cells with MbCD or filipin compared to untreated cells. These results suggested that cholesterol depletion disturbs lipid-raft-dependent endocytosis, but has no effect on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Thus, we suspect that cholesterol depletion influences PRRSV entry by disturbing lipid-raft-dependent pathway in MARC-145 cells.",
