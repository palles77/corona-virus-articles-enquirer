When the membrane-spanning domain of a protein which is efficiently delivered to the plasma membrane (VSV G protein) is replaced with ml, the resulting chimera (Gml) is retained in the Golgi (Swift, A. M., and C. E. Machamer. 1991. J. Cell Biol. 115:19-30). When assayed in sucrose gradients, we observed that Gml formed a large oligomer, and that much of this oligomer was SDS resistant and stayed near the top of the stacking gel of an SDSpolyacrylamide gel. The unusual stability of the oligomer allowed it to be detected easily. Gml mutants with single amino acid substitutions in the ml domain that were retained in the Golgi complex formed SDS-resistant oligomers, whereas mutants that were rapidly released to the plasma membrane did not. Oligomerization was not detected immediately after synthesis of Gml, but occurred gradually with a lag of ,',,10 rain, suggesting that it is not merely aggregation of misfolded proteins.

The lumenal domain was not required for oligomerization since another chimera (otmlG), where the lumenal domain of Gml was replaced by the o~ subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin, also formed an SDS-resistant oligomer, and was able to form hetero-oligomers with Gml as revealed by coprecipitation experiments. SDS resistance was conferred by the cytoplasmic tail of VSV G, because proteolytic digestion of the tail in microsomes containing Gml oligomers resulted in loss of SDS resistance, although the protease-treated material continued to migrate as a large oligomer on sucrose gradients. Interestingly, treatment of cells with cytochalasin D blocked formation of SDS-resistant (but not SDS-sensitive) oligomers. Our data suggest that SDS-resistant oligomers form as newly synthesized molecules of Gml arrive at the Golgi complex and may interact (directly or indirectly) with an actinbased cytoskeletal matrix. The oligomerization of Gml and other resident proteins could serve as a mechanism for their retention in the Golgi complex.",

When cDNA encoding the M protein is expressed in animal cells, the protein is targeted to the cis-Golgi (Machamer et al., 1990) . Structurally, the IBV M protein consists of a short glycosylated amino-terminal domain, three membrane-spanning domains, and a long carboxyterminal cytoplasmic domain. The first membrane-spanning domain (ml) of the M glycoprotein is sufficient to retain this protein in the Golgi (Machamer and Rose, 1987) . Furthermore, the ml domain can confer Golgi localization to a wellcharacterized plasma membrane protein (the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus, or VSV G). VSV G is a type I membrane protein which is cotranslationally inserted into the ER, where it forms homotrimers. It is then rapidly transported through the Golgi complex (as determined by the kinetics of N-linked oligosaccharide processing) and delivered to the plasma membrane (for review see Doms et al., 1993) . When the membrane-spanning domain of VSV G is replaced with the ml domain of IBV M, the resulting chimera (Gml, see Fig. 1 ) is retained in the Golgi complex (Swift and Machamer, 1991) . Extensive mutagenesis suggests that at least four specific amino acids in the ml domain are critical for Golgi retention of Gml: asparagine 465, threonines 469 and 476, and glutamine 480 (Machamer et al., 1993) . Interestingly, these residues form an uncharged polar face along one side of the alpha helix predicted for ml. The polar nature of this face of the helix suggests that protein-protein interactions along this face may mediate Golgi retention of Gml.",

The first involves the recognition of this domain by a specific receptor that either blocks further movement in the exocytic pathway or retrieves escaped proteins back to the appropriate compartment. A receptor-based model also requires a mechanism for retention or recycling of the receptor itself. The second mechanism invokes changes in the tertiary or quaternary structure of the protein that are induced via the membrane-spanning domain when the protein encounters a particular microenvironment. Changes in protein structure could include oligomerization or aggregation (covalent or non-covalent) with other proteins or lipids, which would prevent movement of the protein into transport vesicles. The cis-Golgi may differ from the ER in lipid composition and divalent cation concentration. These changes in microenvironment could conceivably trigger a conformational shift in Golgi resident proteins upon their arrival in the appropriate compartment.",

The sequence of ml is shown in Fig. 1 A. Using site directed mutagenesis, four key residues in the ml domain were shown to be critical for Golgi retention of Gml: asparagine (N,65), two threonines (T~ and T,76), and glutamine (Q~). Some substitutions at Q~0 are tolerated (e.g., GmlQI'hs0) whereas other changes (e.g., GmlQI~o) result in transport of the protein to the cell surface (Machamer et al., 1993) . Another mutation in which two isoleucine residues were inserted near the center of the transmembrane domain (Gmli,~) also disrupts retention in the Golgi complex. These three chimeric proteins (GmL~, GmlQLso, and GmlQH_~o) were expressed in transiently transfected COS-'/ cells and localized by indirect immunofluorescence ( Fig. 1 B) . VSV G and GrnlQI~o were readily detected at the plasma membrane, while Gml and GmlQI-hso were detected only in the Golgi region and largely colocalized with lens culinaris lectin staining, even after treatment with nocodazole or brefeldin A (Machamer et al., 1993) . Gmlin~ staining was less prominent at the plasma membrane than GmlQI~0, and a considerable amount of fluorescence was detected in the Golgi complex. The localizations of these proteins were confirmed in HeLa cells and BHK cells transfected using a vaccinia-virusmediated expression system (not shown).",

The material at the top of the stacking gel was more prevalent in samples immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells ( Fig. 1 C) than in those from COS-7 cells ( Fig. 1 D) . This species was present only in immunoprecipitates from cells that expressed mutants with Golgi-resident populations (Gml, Gmli,, and GmlQH4s0) and it appeared regardless of the level of expression (over a >50-fold range). Although ~50% of the total radioactivity immunoprecipitated from Gml-expressing HeLa cells migrated at the top of the stacking gel, we have not quantitated this information routinely. One problem with quantitation is that this material could include radiolabeled components other than Gml; furthermore, some of the oligomer may not enter the gel at all and be lost during subsequent processing. Gmli,, was previously reported to move through the Golgi complex rapidly (with a half time of 35 rain in COS-7 cells; Swift and Machamer, 1991) . However, the kinetics of transport reflect only the population of protein that enters the separating gel. The SDS-resistant protein may therefore represent a stable Golgi-resident pool.",

The material at the top of the stacking gel could be detected after transfer to nitrocellulose and probing with anti-VSV G antibodies by immunoblotting, suggesting that it contained Gml (or the related constructs; data not shown). Furthermore, this large species was efficiently precipitated by several conformationsensitive anti-VSV G monoclonal antibodies that do not recognize grossly misfolded proteins (Doms et ai., 1988) . We tried to solubilize the Gml oligomer using a wide variety of lysis conditions and sample treatments. None of the modifications we tested, including changes in salt concentration, reducing agents, detergents, chaotropic agents (e.g., urea, guanidinium HC1), or temperature of solubilization or sample elution disrupted the SDS-resistant oligomer (data not shown). A very small amount of SDS-sensitive Gml could be produced when the top of the stacking gel (containing the SDS-resistant oligomer) was isolated after electrophoresis, placed in the well of a fresh gel, and reelectrophoresed (not shown). Together, these observations suggest that SDS-resistant oligomer formation is an intrinsic property of Gml and mutant Gml proteins that are retained in the Golgi complex, but not of mutants that efficiently reach the plasma membrane.

HeLa cells expressing Gml, VSV G, or Gmlin, were metabolically labeled for 15 min, and then chased for 45 min before cell-surface biotinylation with sulfo-NHSbiotin.

Under these conditions, ,o50% of the total VSV G was biotinylated and could be recovered in the streptavidin pellet. Only the mature (sialylated) form of VSV G was recovered in this fraction, suggesting that biotinylation was indeed restricted to cell surface proteins. In contrast, essentially none of the Gml was precipitated by streptavidin, suggesting that this protein remained in an intracellular compartment. A small amount of SDS-sensitive Gmli~, was recovered in the streptavidin pellet. More importantly, no SDS-resistant material was biotinylated, suggesting that the SDS-resistant Gmli~ constitutes an intracellular (perhaps Golgi-resident) pool that is distinct from the SDS-sensitive protein, and that only a portion of Gml~, is transported to the plasma membrane where it can be biotinylated.

At this temperature, newly synthesized proteins accumulate in the intermediate compartment (Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984) . HeLa cells were transfected with constructs encoding Gml or VSV G, metabolically radiolabeled for 5 min, and then chased at 16 or 37\u00b0C as indicated for up to 90 min (Fig. 4) . No oligomer formed when cells expressing Gml were chased at 160C; however, if cells chased at 16\u00b0C were subsequently transferred to 370C, oligomer formation occurred. In separate experiments, we found that the kinetics of oligomer formation at 37\u00b0C were unaffected by the inclusion of a 160C pretreatment step (data not shown). In addition, treatment with 0.3 mM CCCP during the chase period also inhibited SDS-resistant oligomer formation (not shown). This treatment blocks transport of newly synthesized proteins from the ER. These experiments suggested that Gml oligomer formation normally occurred in a post-ER compartment. However, brefeldin A pretreatment (or treatment during chase) did not block oligomer formation (not shown), although it did cause redistribution of Gml to an ER-like pattern (Machamer et al., 1993) .",

Transfected HeLa cells were metabolically radiolabeled for 5 min, and then chased at 16 or 37\u00b0C for up to 90 rain. One set of dishes was incubated for 90 min at 16\u00b0C, then transferred to 37\u00b0C for 60 min. VSV G and related proteins were immunoprecipitated from solubilized cells as described in Materials and Methods. 1988 ). HeLa cells were transiently transfected with VSV G or Gml, and then metabolically radiolabeled for 5 min and solubilized either immediately or after 60 min of chase. Lysates were loaded onto 5-20% sucrose gradients, centrifuged, and analyzed as described in Materials and Methods. Immediately after synthesis, VSV G migrated as a 4S20.~ peak (Fig. 5; Doms et al., 1987) . After a 60-min chase, all of the VSV G had trimerized, migrating as a discrete 8S20,~ peak. The behavior of Gml in these gradients was markedly different. Immediately after synthesis, Gml migrated similarly to the VSV G monomer. After a 60-rain chase, however, much of the Gml was found in the pellet in an SDS-resistant form ( Fig. 5 ; note top of lane). The timedependent shift in the mobility of the oligomer in sucrose gradients suggests that oligomers already exist in the cells at the time of lysis and immunoprecipitation. The SDSsensitive material in the Gml pellet fractions may represent an intermediate form of oligomer that is not yet SDSresistant. Alternatively, this material could contain protein released from the SDS-resistant oligomer during SDS-PAGE. In contrast to our findings with Gml, misfolded mutants of VSV G that aggregate in the ER are found in the pellet (and are SDS-soluble) immediately after synthesis (Doms et al., 1988) . Using different centrifugation conditions, we estimated the average size of the Gml oligomer to be approximately 22S20.~, or roughly 800 kD (data not shown). Therefore, if Gml (MW 66 kD) is the sole component of the oligomer, we estimate there would be ,o12 molecules per oligomer.",

This might suggest that oligomerization is not a retention mechanism for native M protein; alternatively, M oligomers might readily dissociate in detergent. The resistance of the Gml oligomer to solubilization suggests a structural feature of VSV G may stabilize the complex. We asked whether the lumenal domain of VSV G, which is sufficient for trimerization (Doms et al., 1988) , was required for oligomer formation. To do this, we replaced the lumenal domain ofVSV G or Gml with a small soluble glycoprotein, the o~ subunit of hCG. When expressed alone, the oL subunit of hCG is secreted from cells as a monomer (Guan et al., 1988b) . When hCGo~ is fused to the membrane-spanning domain and cytoplasmic tail of VSV G, the chimeric protein (c~m) is membrane-bound and transported to the cell surface (Guan et al., 1988a) . When the VSV G membrane-spanning domain of c~m is replaced with the ml domain of IBV M, the resulting chimera (oemlG) is retained in the Golgi complex (Swift and Machamer, 1991) . Interestingly, in metabolically labeled HeLa cells expressing cxmlG, we observed the time-dependent accumulation of an SDS-resistant species at the interface between the separating and stacking gels (Fig. 6, arrowhead) . This species was not observed in cells expressing am. The smaller l~gure 5. Sucrose gradient sedimentation of Gml and VSV G. HeLa cells transfected with VSV G or Gml were metabolically labeled for 5 rain, and then solubilized immediately or after 60 rain of chase. Lysates were loaded onto 5-20% sucrose gradients and centrifuged as described in Materials and Methods. Fractions were collected, immunoprecipitated using anti-VSV antibody, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After the 60-min chase, all of the Gml formed a large oligomer that pelleted under these gradient conditions, and much of it was SDS-resistant. size of the otmlG SDS-resistant oligomer is consistent with the size difference between ctmlG and Gml (28 vs 66 kD). On sucrose gradients, c~mlG solubilized 60 min after synthesis migrated as a larger species (some of which was SDSresistant) than newly synthesized oanlG. In contrast, the mobility of o~m on sucrose gradients was unaltered during the chase (data not shown). Thus the VSV G lumenal domain was not required for SDS-resistant oligomer formation.",

Depolymerization of microtubules with colchicine (50/~M) had no effect on the amount of SDS-resistant Gml formed (not shown). Interestingly, treatment with cytochalasin D (100/zM) starting 1 h before metabolic labeling blocked formation of SDS-resistant Gml oligomers (Fig. 10, lane 3) . The amount of immunoprecipitated radiolabel migrating at the top of the stacking gel decreased from 43 % of total in untreated cells to 18 % of total in cytochalasin D-treated cells (compare Fig. 10 , lanes I and 3). Cytochalasin D did not block the transport of VSV G since the rate of sialylation was enhanced relative to untreated cells. On sucrose gradients, Gml solubilized from cytochalasin D-treated cells migrated as an SDS-sensitive oligomer (in the pellet), and VSV G trimerization was unaffected (data not shown). This observation suggests that oligomer formation and SDS-resistance are separable characteristics, and furthermore implies that SDS-resistance may result from interaction between Gml and an actin-based matrix or cytoskeleton.",

HeLa cells expressing Gml or VSV G were treated with cytochalasin D (100/zM) for 1 h before a 15-min metabolic labeling. Microsomes were prepared after a 45-min chase and mock-treated or treated with 20/zg of TPCK-trypsin for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, and then solubilized and immunoprecipitated using anti-VSV antibody (Fig. 10) . As mentioned above, treatment with cytochalasin D enhanced the fraction ofVSV G that became sialylated during this period (compare lanes 5 and 7). We routinely observed that trypsin degraded most of the VSV G recovered from cytochalasin D-treated cells (lane 8), suggesting that the orientation or durability of microsomes was affected by treatment with this perturbant. Interestingly, trypsin digestion of Gml recovered from cytochalasin D-treated cells yielded predominantly the smaller proteolytic species, generated by cleavage within region B in Fig. 8 A. We therefore conclude that the larger Gml species does indeed represent material digested from SDSresistant oligomers, and furthermore, that the oligomers may interact with an actin-based cytoskeleton.",

An unusual feature of the Gml oligomer (its resistance to solubflization by SDS) allowed us to easily assay oligomer formation. The specificity of oligomerization was mediated by the ml transmembrane domain, since mutant Gml proteins that were retained in the Golgi formed oligomers, while mutant proteins that were released to the plasma membrane did not. This specificity was preserved in another construct, otmlG, in which the lumenal domain of VSV G was replaced with the o~ subunit of hCG. Furthermore, e~mlG was able to form hetero-oligomers with Gml and other Golgi-resident Gml mutants, but not with mutants that move to the plasma membrane. This suggested that the lumenal domain of VSV G was not required for oligomerization.",

When the cytoplasmic tails of preexisting oligomers were digested with trypsin, the proteolytic products were soluble in SDS but continued to migrate as oligomers on sucrose gradients. Based on potential trypsin cleavage sites in the cytoplasmic tail of Gml and the migration of the proteolytic fragments on SDS-PAGE, it is possible that removal of the last three carboxyterminal residues of Gml destroys its resistance to solubilization by SDS. Alternatively, trypsin digestion could remove another component of the oligomer that is required for SDS resistance. Interestingly, cell treatment with cytochalasin D blocked the formation of SDS-resistant oligomers, suggesting that the acquisition of SDS resistance may reflect association of the Gml cytoplasmic tail with an actin-based cytoskeleton. We are currently constructing a series of Gml proteins with truncated cytoplasmic tails to determine if these proteins are correctly targeted and form oligomers.",

Interestingly, SDS-resistant oligomers did form in brefeldin A-treated cells, suggesting that oligomers can form in pre-Golgi compartments under certain conditions. Brefeldin A treatment may generate the conditions required to stimulate oligomer formation in the ER. Conditions which could trigger Gml oligomerization might include its concentration in the membrane, the retrieval of glycolipids or glycoproteins typical of the Golgi complex, or changes in pH or divalent ion concentrations.",

The best example is glycophorin A, whose single transmembrane domain interacts to form homodimers (Bormann et al., 1989) . This dimer is resistant to solubilization by SDS at ambient temperature, although resistance is overcome by dilution or incubation at higher temperatures (Furthmayr and Marchesi, 1976) . Dimerization ofglycophorin A is highly sequence specific and appears to involve interactions between hydrophobic residues in the transmembrane domain (Lemmon et al., 1992) . The transmembrane domains of the T-cell receptor (Cosson et al., 1991) and of class H major histocompatibility complex molecules also appear to mediate dimer formation (Cosson and Bonifacino, 1992) . In the case of major histocompatibility complex molecules, o~ and/~ chains interact to form heterodimers; dimerization appears to require a pair of oppositely charged amino acids at the lumenal edge of the apposing membrane spans. A series of glycine residues on each membrane span forms a nonpolar face which allows close packing of the transmembrane domains (Cosson and Bonifacino, 1992) . Similarly, the o~ chain of the T-cell receptor assembles with the CD3 6 chain via interaction between charged transmembrane residues (Manolios et al., 1990; Cosson et al., 1991) .",

The large lumenal domain of Gml may sterically prevent direct interaction between many transmembrane domains to form an oligomer. Furthermore, the polar face of the ml domain itself could be expected to interact with at most one or two similar domains. The transmembrane domains of these proteins might interact to form small clusters (dimers or trimers) of Gml, mutant Gml proteins, and ~mlG. These clusters could be organized into large arrays by interactions between the heads and/or tails of proteins in different clusters. These structures might contain lipids and other endogenous Golgi-resident proteins.

No obvious homologies exist between the primary sequences of these membrane-spanning domains, even in enzymes thought to be enriched in the same subcompartment. Thus, the membrane composition of Golgi subcompartments may be responsible for specific retention of resident proteins throughout this organelle. Consistent with this, no soluble resident Golgi proteins have been detected to date. Nilsson et al. (1993) have proposed that the cytoplasmic tails of resident proteins in sequential Golgi stacks may in-teract (perhaps via a cytoplasmic linking protein) to maintain the stacks in close apposition. The formation of Gml oligomers may reflect association with such endogenous structures. The combination of overexpression and our metabolic radiolabeling conditions would not be expected to reveal any long-lived endogenous Golgi-resident proteins that also reside in the oligomer. However, longer radiolabeling conditions in stable cell lines expressing Gml may reveal other putative components of the oligomer. We are currently performing such experiments.",
