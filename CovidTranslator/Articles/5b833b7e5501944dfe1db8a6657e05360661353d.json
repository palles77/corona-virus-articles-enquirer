            "text": "| RNA molecules are essential for cellular information transfer and gene regulation, and RNAs have been implicated in many human diseases. Messenger and non-coding RNAs contain highly structured elements, and evidence suggests that many of these structures are important for function. Targeting these RNAs with small molecules offers opportunities to therapeutically modulate numerous cellular processes, including those linked to 'undruggable' protein targets. Despite this promise, there is currently only a single class of human-designed small molecules that target RNA used clinically -the linezolid antibiotics. However, a growing number of small-molecule RNA ligands are being identified, leading to burgeoning interest in the field. Here, we discuss principles for discovering small-molecule drugs that target RNA and argue that the overarching challenge is to identify appropriate target structures -namely, in disease-causing RNAs that have high information content and, consequently, appropriate ligand-binding pockets. If focus is placed on such druggable binding sites in RNA, extensive knowledge of the typical physicochemical properties of drug-like small molecules could then enable small-molecule drug discovery for RNA targets to become (only) roughly as difficult as for protein targets.

Successful protein-targeted drugs include small molecules that bind proteins expressed by humans (FIG. 1) or those expressed by bacteria, viruses and other infectious organisms. If small-molecule therapeutics could be extended to modulate RNA, the landscape of targetable macromolecules would be expanded by more than an order of magnitude. For example, only roughly 1.5% of the human genome encodes proteins 1, 2 . Within the roughly 20,000 expressed human proteins, 10-15% of these are thought to be disease-related [3] [4] [5] , meaning that disrupting or altering their activity is likely to have a therapeutically useful consequence. Within the group of disease-related proteins, many are termed 'undruggable' , meaning that these molecules lack distinctive cleft-like motifs into which small molecules can bind with high specificity and affinity 5 . The net implication of this analysis is that de novo that function directly as RNA) 9 (FIG. 1) . One class of non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, are now well-validated therapeutic targets 10, 11 . Humans probably produce more than 15,000 long non-coding RNAs 12 , and a subset of these may eventually prove to be good drug targets. In summary, if a fraction of the tens of thousands of mRNAs and non-coding RNAs were targetable, the extent of the druggable human genome could increase considerably.",

If mRNAs could be targeted, protein gene products could be modulated by upregulating or downregulating translation efficiency or by altering mRNA abundance or stability. By directly targeting mRNAs, activities of proteins that are very difficult to drug or undruggable might be modulated before or during their biogenesis. In addition, a large fraction of the human genome (~70%) is transcribed into non-coding RNAs (RNAs Any discussion of how to target RNA with small molecules needs to immediately acknowledge that no one currently knows how to create drug-like, RNA-targeted small molecules in a repeatable and scalable way. There is currently only a single human-designed and approved drug class that functions by binding RNA and molecules with likely nonspecific intercalation behaviour. In cases where a research group developed a series of related compounds, we included a single representative example.

Linezolid is a special case because ribosomes are highly abundant in cells and because small molecules targeting the ribosome need to achieve only modest binding affinity; the linezolid-ribosome equilibrium dissociation constant (K d ) is approximately 20 \u03bcM. Merck's ribocil binds to riboflavin riboswitches, which function as RNA-mediated regulators of gene expression in bacteria. Ribocil has many attractive features but is unlikely to be pursued further because bacteria rapidly develop resistance to this drug 30, 31 . Ribocil bears no chemical similarity to the natural metabolite ligand alone -the linezolid antibiotics, linezolid and tedizolid (FIG. 2) . In our view, successful targeting of RNA in therapeutically useful ways with small molecules requires three distinct components: (1) identification of RNAs and RNA motifs with disease-related function, (2) use of screening approaches and libraries likely to identify drug-like molecules with appropriate pharmacological properties and (3) identification of and focus on RNA motifs with sufficient structural sophistication that make it likely that high affinity and specificity in small-molecule binding can be achieved. To date, most work has focused on therapeutically well-validated targets (component 1), and there has been a notable recent focus on screening against RNA targets with drug-like lead compounds (component 2). However -and critically in our view -considerations of target complexity and achievable selectivity (component 3) have been largely neglected. With this in mind, after overviewing the current state of small-molecule ligand discovery for RNA targets and some instructional examples, we present a set of hypotheses regarding how to target RNA with small molecules and guidelines for achieving this goal. This article is intended to be provocative, and we look forward to the feedback and responses that our ideas will engender.",

We de-emphasized aminoglycosides Nature Reviews | Drug Discover\u1ef9 Figure 1 | The potential RNA-targeted druggable genome. Only a small fraction of the human genome has been successfully drugged to date. As shown in the pie chart, only ~1.5% of the genome encodes proteins (corresponding to ~20,000 proteins) 1,2 . As shown in the expanded pie segment above, an estimated 10-15% of proteins are thought to be disease-related [3] [4] [5] (~2,000-3,000 proteins; encoded by 0.2% of the genome). Currently approved drugs interact therapeutically with <700 of these proteins (encoded by 0.05% of the human genome) 6 . Targeting RNAs could expand on the proportion of the human genome that could be therapeutically targeted. Possible RNA targets include mRNAs that encode disease-related proteins that have been characterized as undruggable or difficult to drug (shown in light blue in the pie segment) and also non-coding RNAs that influence disease (corresponding to an unknown proportion of the ~70% of the genome that encodes non-coding RNAs). and represents a major accomplishment in human-initiated RNA-targeted ligand development. Nonetheless, ribocil binding to a riboswitch is a special case because the drug binds in the same pocket as the natural flavin mononucleotide ligand, and thus this RNA is predisposed to bind a small molecule. The binding sites for Novartis's branaplam (originally called NVS-SM1) and PTC Therapeutics' chemotypically similar SMA-C5 have been publicly shared in a qualitative way 32, 33 . These molecules both appear to bind at the RNA duplex formed between the U1 RNA and the target (SMN2) pre-mRNA and are probably stabilized either indirectly or directly by protein components reviewers [24] [25] [26] . Discovery strategies included high-throughput screening 30, 32, [36] [37] [38] [39] , use of focused libraries [40] [41] [42] , structure-inspired design [43] [44] [45] , fragment-based approaches 46 and computational modelling 47, 48 . Both compact and multivalent molecules are represented. Together, the molecules in FIGS. 2 and 3 strike us as reasonable validation of the potential of RNA as a small-molecule drug target. However, with the exceptions of the four named compounds in FIG. 2a, these molecules show deficiencies in one or more features of a conventional drug-like molecule.",

First, most (five out of six) of the molecules targeting higher-order tertiary structures are drug-like (as inferred by comparing their QED score with those of orally available drugs), independent of their potency (FIG. 2b, circles and green shading). This observation suggests that the ability to identify RNA-targeting small molecules with good drug-like properties is interrelated with the choice of RNA target. We explore this idea in depth below. Second, for compounds targeting RNA secondary structures or repeat sequences, it has been difficult to achieve good drug-likeness and high potency simultaneously. Indeed, for molecules targeting secondary structures, drug-likeness and RNA binding affinity are anticorrelated: high potencies are achieved only with the most undrug-like molecules (FIG. 2b, squares, diamonds and dashed line). Moreover, in the relatively few cases where authors have examined a substantial number of molecules in a ligand discovery programme, the observed structure-activity relationship (SAR) is often relatively flat 39, 40, 46, 49 , indicating that it has proved difficult to improve the potency of a lead molecule. Thus, despite considerable effort and creativity, most compounds identified to date do not have characteristics of known potent bioavailable small-molecule drugs and do not target complex RNA sites as do known high-specificity drugs.",

It is also possible that RNA-targeted drugs will follow a different set of principles from those that target proteins. There is some evidence that molecules that bind RNA have different structural 24 and kinetic 98 properties, on average, than small molecules that bind proteins. Nonetheless, drug-likeness is strongly influenced by bioavailability and human physiology, which are the same for all drugs.

Targeting pathogenic repeat expansion sequences (for example, the CUG and CAG repeats characteristic of DM1 and Huntington disease, respectively) might represent an intriguing special case. Although trinucleotide repeat sequences have low complexity and do not appear to contain an obvious ligandable pocket (see below), it is possible that cooperative binding or in situ assembly of ligands driven by the supra-secondary structure of the repeating sequence might afford critical specificity and selectivity 19, 53 .

One question that arises immediately when thinking about targeting RNA with small molecules is whether the structural differences between RNA and proteins render RNA less druggable than proteins. RNA is composed of only four primary nucleotide building blocks and is much more highly charged and more hydrophilic than a typical protein. We suggest that focusing on these global differences misses the point and that the key issue in drugging RNA is whether RNA can form specific binding sites capable of binding drug-like molecules. Current evidence suggests that bacterial 17 in their target RNAs -the large subunit bacterial ribosomal RNA and a bacterial flavin mononucleotide (FMN) riboswitch, respectively (FIG. 4) . Both ligand-binding sites are complex in the sense that they feature both inner-sphere nucleobases that are in direct contact with the ligand and a set of outer-sphere nucleotides that further rigidify and support the structure of the ligand-binding site [29] [30] [31] 67 (FIG. 4) .

Riboflavin contains three distinctive molecular entities: a nitrogen-rich pteridine-2,4-dione two-ring system, a hydrophobic dimethylbenzene ring and a ribose group. Riboflavin kinase protein 69 and a flavin RNA riboswitch 70 recognize riboflavin in similar but not identical ways. Both protein and RNA form multiple hydrogen bonds with the pteridine ring system, both make multiple van der Waals contacts with the dimethylbenzene ring, both form hydrophobic or stacking interactions from above and below the plane of the three-ring system, and both form hydrogen bonds with a hydroxyl group in the ribose chain (FIG. 5) . This analysis shows Good RNA targets should have high information content. An overarching concern in targeting RNA is how to achieve both high binding affinity and high selectivity in the cellular context in which there are many similar RNA motifs. To date, a substantial fraction of the effort devoted to targeting RNA has focused on simple RNA structures consisting of base-paired helices or irregular and bulge-containing duplexes (FIG. 3) .

These SHAPE reactivities can then be interpreted using RNA folding software to define the secondary structure of an RNA target, where regions with low versus high reactivities tend to be base-paired or single-stranded, respectively. The total number of bits in an RNA target site can be estimated from this secondary structure when taken together with additional biochemical data from, for example, comparative sequence analysis 71,73 , biochemical experiments 72 or inspection of interactions observed in high-resolution studies. Applying these rules to the recognition of the HIV-1 transactivation response (TAR) RNA element by short transactivator of transcription (Tat)-derived peptides 99 , scored based on the information content of structural elements recognized by the peptides, reveals that this interaction site contains about 22 \u00b1 5 bits of information, as shown in the figure. Boxed nucleotides show sequence specificity; brackets indicate elements where structure, but not sequence, is the primary constraint.",

Nonetheless, current examples are supportive of the fundamental targetability of RNA. We suspect that a wide variety of screening strategies -including phenotypic assays, high-throughput screening, fragment-based screening, small-molecule microarrays, other biophysical partitioning approaches, and structure-inspired and computationally assisted design -will eventually prove useful.
