Asthma control levels often change during pregnancy. It is generally believed that one-third of asthma patients are aggravated due to pregnancy, and most occur in the middle of pregnancy; one-third improved, and no significant changes are observed in the remaining 1/3 of patients. But a latest multicase-control study shows that the percentage of asthma worsening during pregnancy is 18.8%, lower than the previous data, and the worsening is significantly associated with the severity of the disease [4] . ere are also many problems in the control of asthma during pregnancy. Studies show that about 65% of patients have poor control of asthma during pregnancy, inhaler technology is not correct in 64.4% of cases, only 38% of patients know the difference between asthma reliever and controlled medications, 12.7% of patients receive a written asthma action plan, 17% of patients have spirometry in the past 5 years, and 3.8% of them have peak expiratory flow meter at home [5] . Studies have shown that maternal asthma increases the risk for adverse complications in fetuses and mothers, including SGA (small for gestational age), LBW (low birth weight), congenital malformations (cleft lip or cleft palate), increased perinatal mortality, PB (premature birth), maternal preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, prenatal hemorrhage, caesarean section, urinary tract infection, excessive amniotic fluid, and premature rupture of membranes, especially for those patients with severe or uncontrolled asthma during pregnancy [6, 7] .",

Vicki et al. support this conclusion. eir research suggests that the placenta plays an important role in regulating fetal growth by producing an enzyme, 11\u03b2hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11\u03b2-HSD-2), which can convert endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids derived from the maternal circulation to their inactive metabolites. As a consequence, 11\u03b2-HSD-2 activity has a positive correlation with birth weight. Asthmatic patients without using ICS and 11\u03b2-HSD-2 activity are reduced in placentae of female fetuses and that may be associated with inflammatory factors produced during the pathogenesis of asthma. While using low, moderate, or high doses ICS will not affect placental capacity to metabolise glucocorticoids, so it does not affect the birth weight, which may be related to the fact that ICS is able to increase production of placenta 11\u03b2-HSD-2. Additionally, uncontrolled asthma frequently shows associations with adverse perinatal outcomes, as previously demonstrated with exacerbations in cohorts of asthma in pregnancy, and the continued use of ICS with budesonide is recommended and has a particularly good safety profile [25] . In short, asthma itself has more adverse effects on the placenta than its treatment [26] .",

A cohort study incorporating 7376 pregnancies also discovers no increased prevalence of LBW, PB, and SGA in pregnant women with asthma for longacting beta2-agonists (LABA) use and ICS doses <125 \u03bcg/ day, while a trend for an increased prevalence of the outcomes is seen for ICS doses above 125 \u03bcg/day. Maternal glucocorticoid-regulated systems are susceptible to ICS Canadian Respiratory Journal (800 \u03bcg/day for first and second trimester and 900 \u03bcg/day for third trimester) for asthma during pregnancy, but glucocorticoid-regulated pathways in the fetus are not affected by ICS use, which implied that ICS use for the control of asthma during pregnancy is unlikely to contribute to adverse effects on fetal growth and development [28] .",

            "text": "A research finds no significant relationships between major congenital malformations and SGA infants with exposure to beta2-agonists, theophylline, cromolyn, and corticosteroids during the first trimester or at any time [36] . A retrospective cohort study of 13117 pregnancies finds no increased risk of congenital malformations with SABA exposure during the first trimester, while using LABA in the first trimester is significantly associated with a higher risk of major \"cardiac malformations\" and major \"other and unspecified congenital malformations.\" However, bias due to different asthma severity or chance should be considered [37] . A review identified 21 original studies; 4 studies report that use of SABA during pregnancy increases risk of congenital malformations, while one study reports that high doses of SABA decrease the risk. Four studies indicate that beta2-agonists (SABA and/or LABA) contribute to increased risk of congenital malformations; one study shows a significant increased risk with LABA. One study shows that LABA led to low birth weight babies [38] . A populationbased case-malformed control study including 76,249 registrations of congenital anomalies from 13 EUROmediCAT registries finds that exposure to first trimester with inhaled beta2-agonists increases the risk of cleft palate and gastroschisis. Also, exposure to the combination of LABA and ICS is associated with renal dysplasia [39] . However, in the cohort study of 567 cases of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and 256 cases of preeclampsia/eclampsia, LABA use is not associated with increased risks of HDP or preeclampsia/eclampsia, suggesting the safety of LABAs for the cure of asthma in pregnancy [40] . Besides, maternal asthma is closely associated with increased risk of offspring autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but this adverse effect is not associated with prenatal exposure to asthma medications including LABA [41] . GINA (2019) suggests that SABA alone is no longer as the recommended therapeutic strategy for asthma; instead GINA recommends that all adults and adolescents with asthma should receive either symptomdriven (for mild asthma) or daily inhaled anti-inflammatory controller treatment, to reduce their risk of serious exacerbations and to control symptoms.",

GINA guidelines suggest that combination of formoterol and SABA could be used to treat severe acute asthma attacks. Previous studies also have demonstrated that the use of SABA plus ipratropium bromide can effectively improve severe acute asthma control. However, there is still much controversy over whether ipratropium bromide can reduce the admission rate of patients and improve their lung function [42] . A study finds that, for patients with poor asthma control by applying ICS or ICS combined with LABA, tiotropium as add-on therapy can improve pulmonary function and reduce the frequency of exacerbations [43] . In a systematic review of 13 randomized-placebo controlled trials, the use of anticholinergic tiotropium ameliorates asthma control in patients with moderate symptomatic asthma who have already received medium-to-high doses ICS or ICS/LABA [44] , while there are few studies on the use of anticholinergics in asthma patients during pregnancy. More studies are needed to confirm the relationship between anticholinergic drugs and perinatal adverse outcomes.",

When serum theophylline is higher than 20 \u03bcg/ml, the risk of theophylline toxic reactions will increase [46] . Since the recommended dose of theophylline is close to the toxic dose, the plasma or urine concentration must be closely monitored during the treatment, especially for pregnant women whose liver metabolic function decreased. e updated GINA guidelines indicate that lowdose theophylline (serum concentrations must be monitored closely) is considered as an alternative, but not a preferred treatment for mild persistent asthma during pregnancy. For moderate-to-severe asthma during pregnancy, theophylline may be considered as an alternative adjunctive long-acting bronchodilator therapy but not a preferred therapy when ICS alone does not provide adequately asthma control during pregnancy. Additionally, theophylline use has no or minimal effects on fetal growth and reduces perinatal complications when maternal asthma is adequately controlled [45] . In a multicenter prospective study, compared with the effects of ICS and oral theophylline on asthmatic pregnant women, the two cohorts have similar rates of asthma exacerbations, asthma outcomes, and obstetric and perinatal outcomes, while theophylline group has more adverse events, drug withdrawal rate during observation period and FEV1 <80% predicted value of lung function than glucocorticoids group [48] . At present, the use of controlled-release theophylline preparations is advocated, which can dilate bronchus for 10-12 hours, and is conducive to the control of night asthma.",

A review reports that uterine cramps may occur during anaphylaxis, also there are possible side effects of venom immunotherapy, and a 28year-old woman under wasp venom desensitization has a premature birth in her 24th week of pregnancy [60] . It is generally recognized that AIT should not be initiated during pregnancy because the risk of anaphylaxis is unknown and the benefits appear minimal. However, it can be continued in patients who already received an allergic vaccine, on a stable and nonescalating dose, and whose symptoms appear to improve [54] . A group of 121 pregnancies from 90 atopic mothers who have received immunotherapy during pregnancy are studied retrospectively. e incidence of prematurity, toxemia, abortion, neonatal death, and congenital malformation is not greater than that for the general population.

A retrospective study included 81 patients (109 pregnancies) receiving subcutaneous immunotherapy and 60 pregnant patients (82 pregnancies) without receiving immunotherapy. In the treatment group, the incidence is similar to or less than the general population with regard to abortion, perinatal mortality, prematurity, toxemia, and congenital malformation. In the control group, there is a higher incidence of abortion, prematurity, and toxemia as compared with those treated with immunotherapy. In addition, seven patients of the treatment group who are already pregnant when immunotherapy is initiated did not develop any complications and all delivered normally [62] . In a prospective study, the subjects are divided into three groups: the treatment group receiving SLIT (sublingual AIT, n \ufffd 155) with either house dust mite or a mixture of up to five allergens, of which 24 pregnancies received sublingual immunotherapy for the first time during pregnancy, the control group A received budesonide 400 \u03bcg twice daily (n \ufffd 85), and the control group B receives rescue treatment with salbutamol (n \ufffd 40). After follow-up for six years, the incidence of perinatal deaths, prematurity, and toxemia of pregnancy is less than that in the general population but the incidence of complications is higher in both control groups. None of the 24 patients develops complications during pregnancy and none has reactions to SLIT [63] .",

And attack during pregnancy occurs mainly in the late second trimester, a mean of 25.1 \u00b1 0.9 weeks of gestation. e major triggers are viral infection and nonadherence to ICS; besides, the undertreatment of asthma and changes in hormone levels also play a role [64] [65] [66] . Attack of asthma during pregnancy is connected with increased risk of adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. Current studies have shown that acute attack increases the risk of LBW; however, the relationship between acute attack and other adverse outcomes is still controversial, such as PB, SGA, congenital malformations, neonatal death, and hospitalizations, as well as a range of maternal and placental complications, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, placenta previa, and caesarean section [66, 67] .",

Symptoms worsening is the main manifestation of the patient, combined with PEF monitoring and attention to fetal activity which is helpful in judging the condition. If PEF decreases more than 50%, personal predicted suggests severe exacerbation [29] . Patients with asthma in pregnancy can be treated by themselves in the early stage of asthma attack, and the specific steps and medication are the same as nonpregnancy asthma. Once the patient's asthma symptoms are poor relieved or even worse, they should be hospitalized in time. In order to avoid hypoxia of pregnant women and fetuses, consider the following: giving oxygen inhalation to pregnant women, continuously monitoring oxygen saturation and fetal heart rate, using SABA and ICS actively, adding OCS if the patients are with poor effect, and even using intravenous hormone as soon as possible for the patients with respiratory failure.",

Furthermore, if mothers use SABA in large doses, newborns, especially premature babies, need to be tested for blood glucose within 24 hours. In addition, asthma patients should also be cautious about using some common measures during delivery such as drugs for cervical ripening, analgesic, and anesthesia. Oxytocin and prostaglandin E2 can be to induce labor in asthmatics. Fentanyl is an acceptable drug to relieve pain; however, morphine, meperidine, or other narcotics for analgesia are likely to cause the release of histamines and bronchospasm. Epidural rather than general anesthesia is recommended for asthmatics who need a painless delivery to reduce the risk of pulmonary infection and atelectasis [68, 69] .",
