Plasma therapy has been used experimentally for the last 100 years to treat severe infectious diseases beginning with diphtheria in the 1890's, Spanish flu of 1917-1918, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and most recently, the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. A meta-analysis of 8 non-randomized studies using convalescent blood products during the 1918 influenza pandemic calculated a case-fatality rate of 16% among 336 treated participants compared to 37% among 1219 controls. [1] A cohort study of 93 participants with severe H1N1 influenza demonstrated lower mortality in the treatment group receiving H1N1 convalescent plasma vs the control group (20\u00b70% vs. 54\u00b78%; P = .01), [2] although mortality in the control group was higher than expected for comparable severity of illness. [3] [4] [5] [6] Despite these encouraging data, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) of immune plasma for severe influenza has ever been conducted. In an effort to more rigorously evaluate the role of immune plasma in the treatment of severe influenza we conducted a RCT in a non-pandemic setting in participants with respiratory compromise due to influenza.",

The study initially was restricted to onset of illness within 7 days, but subsequently revised to allow participants to be enrolled regardless of onset time if there was active viral replication (as evidenced by a positive diagnostic test). The study initially enrolled participants with influenza H1N1 only, but was amended to also include influenza H3N2 and B. Participants were excluded if ABO compatible plasma was not available, if the participant had received investigational antivirals in the prior 2 weeks, if they had a history of any allergic reactions to blood products, if they had medical conditions in which they could not tolerate 500 mL volume, or if there was a clinical suspicion that the etiology of acute illness was primarily due to a condition other than active influenza virus replication (e.g. primarily a bacterial superinfection).

The primary efficacy endpoint chosen was normalization of tachypnea or hypoxia defined as normalization of both respiratory rate (\u2264 20 for adults, or below the age defined thresholds of 20-38 for children), and room air saturation of oxygen (SaO2) \u226593%. The secondary endpoints included: incidence and duration of clinical symptoms, incidence and duration of fever, time to resolution of all symptoms and fever, in-hospital, and 28-day mortality, duration of hospitalization, number of admissions and duration of admission to an intensive care unit, incidence and duration of supplemental oxygen, incidence of ARDS, incidence and duration of requiring mechanical ventilation, and disposition (home with no health care, home with health care, transferred to long-term care facility, hospitalization ongoing at Day 28, discharged to hospice care, deceased) following the last hospital discharge. All secondary analysis including subgroups were pre-specified in a formal Statistical Analysis Plan with the exception of the 6-step ordinal scale of clinical status at Day 7, which was developed for a separate anti-influenza IVIG study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02287467) and was used post-hoc in this study.",

The need for virologic efficacy endpoints in influenza therapeutics has been well argued [12] but, to date, even oseltamivir has not shown conclusive efficacy in terms of decreased viral shedding. The prior study with anti-influenza convalescent plasma [2] did report a difference in rate of decrease of viral shedding, though the cohort design and high mortality in the control arm make direct comparisons to this study difficult. The prior study with hyper-immune antiinfluenza immunoglobulin did show virologic benefit on day 3 and 5, though as previously noted did not show clinical benefit for the primary analysis population. [11] Currently the FDA does not consider virologic endpoints alone to be sufficient as primary endpoints given the lack of a predictive relationship between reductions in viral titers and clinical benefit, as well as substantial variability in methods of quantifying viral shedding. [13] The use of HAI titer as a measure of immunity in the prevention of influenza is well established, [14] and therefore an increase in HAI titers by plasma might be anticipated to decrease viral shedding. Additionally, several hundred units of plasma are screened each week to support this study, so the assay needed to be scalable for high throughput. For these reasons, units for this study were screened by HAI. However, the prior cohort study with anti-influenza convalescent plasma screened units by neutralizing antibody titer (NAT). [2] While NAT and HAI are generally related, there is not sufficient data to know which is the more appropriate method for screening plasma units. Additionally, it is possible that systemically administered antibodies do not sufficiently permeate mucosal surfaces in order to affect viral replication.",

The analysis of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship of this intervention, however, presents several challenges. The administered plasma is not discernable from the intrinsic immune response. Unlike small molecules, the baseline titer does not begin at 0 due to both pre-existing immunity (prior infections and vaccinations) as well as any immune response occurring after the illness onset. By Day 28, the titer is higher in all participants regardless of treatment due to the adaptive immune response and remains elevated above baseline for months. Given the complexity of this type of analysis, the PK/PD is beyond the scope of this paper.",

One unintended consequence of this decision was the observation that losses to follow up appeared to be somewhat higher in the participants that received standard care as compared to those that received plasma. After being consented but then informed that no specific study treatment would be provided, we suspect that participants that received standard care were less motivated to complete all study visits.

With the limited sample size, we were concerned that additional stratification could have led to incomplete filling of blocks (over-stratification), and subsequent imbalances.

Major challenges included a low incidence of influenza illness in some years of the study and the lack of experience of most blood establishments with using plasma as an investigational product. Some participants, families, and even treating physicians also expressed reluctance in using a human blood product for a disease like influenza, where morbidity and mortality is often underappreciated. There were additional challenges unique to the investigational product including the moving target of antigenic drift in circulating influenza subtypes and the need to match this evolution over time with contemporaneous plasma, and the comparatively short shelf life of plasma units necessitating frequent replenishment of expiring units.",
