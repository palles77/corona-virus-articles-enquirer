[6] Our current recommendation is all paediatric patients undergoing urgent otolaryngology procedures should be treated as suspected COVID-19 cases until proven otherwise due to the higher proportion of asymptomatic children carrying COVID-19. This is in keeping with guidance emerging from surgical societies and professional organisations. [7] While universal screening of patients prior to surgery would be ideal, few institutions around the world are currently equipped to do so due to restricted availability of testing resources. False negative test results remain an area of concern. As such, specific recommendations about which patients to test is currently evolving day by day and is beyond the scope of our discussion.",

Management of the airway during urgent paediatric otolaryngology procedures should aim to keep aerosol generation and gas escape from the airway to a minimum. Airway circuits should be closed for as long as possible and minimal airway or mucosal instrumentation should be performed. [12] Procedures should be restricted to urgent components only and any suitable modifications or abbreviations to usual procedure should be employed, with the goal of limiting staff exposure to operating time and aerosol generation. No powered instrumentation should be used for soft tissue (e.g. microdebrider or laser). Minimal power should be used where drills or burrs are required for bone, however this work should be deferred wherever possible.",

The requirement for an open circuit delivery of gas/oxygen via the nasopharynx or oropharynx combined with the manipulation of mucosa distributes a very high aerosol volume. Every effort should be made to shorten the procedure time before, during and after the case to minimize the exposure to viral aerosol by staff. [11, 13] As these procedures routinely involve oxygenating the patient via a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal airway, without any containment of aerosols, the follow advice applies: Pre-operative briefing prior to patient arriving in theatre allows for targeted planning and optimized equipment preparation. A modified WHO checklist was utilized to adequately prepare all staff as to their roles and responsibilities. Where time permits and while teams are learning about how to operate under these conditions, we found that short rehearsal of the procedure with the team beneficial. Our overnight theatre teams have begun their shift with a quick simulation to familiarize themselves with who will be performing what role and checking PPE stocking in the relevant theatres to ensure things are ready for an emergent case involving a COVID patient.",

[10, 11] Where the temptation is to remove PPE quickly at the end of the case, additional time should be allocated for this. As team members doff, team members need to supervise each other as they doff (especially while staff are new to PPE) to prompt the steps of doffing with proper hand hygiene to be performed between steps. Laminated guides on the wall in these areas are also helpful. This is especially important given the high level of contamination of the theatre and onto staff's PPE during MLB. Aerosol settling time of 20 minutes is allocated at our institution between the patient leaving at the end of the case prior to any cleaning by nursing staff.",

Especially with the addition of staff upskilling with donning and doffing of PPE, allow for up to double the usual time required for a case from brief to transfer of the patient back to intensive care or their ward environment. This should be taken into account in discussion with relatives and ward staff. -Team preparation",

PPE needs to be donned and checked prior to receiving the patient and time should be allocated even inemergent cases. b) Anesthesia and airway management during MLB Anesthetic rooms should not be used and induction of anesthesia should be in the operating theatre itself. Where the patient is being transferred from intensive care, minimal manipulation of airway adjuncts or suctioning should be minimized until all staff and equipment for the procedure is ready to begin immediately. Insertion of an LMA at induction of anesthesia and prior to commencement of MLB/rigid bronchoscopy should also be considered. This decreases distribution of aerosols compared to open airway.[10,11] It allows a short but additional time period for preparation of equipment, clinician positioning, WHO surgical safety checklist etc while minimizing time with an open airway. Caution should employed though as the LMA does not provide protection from spread of viral spread so should be used for the shortest possible period of time. There are many other guidelines being published by our anesthetic colleagues and these are beyond the scope of this discussion.",
