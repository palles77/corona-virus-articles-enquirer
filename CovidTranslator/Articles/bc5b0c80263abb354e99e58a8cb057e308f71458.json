However, this issue has never been fully elucidated. Based on the premise that SARS patients belonging to a given genotype group having a significantly higher SARS infection rate than others would imply that genotype group being more susceptible, we make use of a compartmental model describing disease transmission dynamics and clinical and gene data of 100 laboratory confirmed SARS patients from Chinese Han population in Taiwan to estimate the infection rates of distinct candidate genotype groups among these SARS-infected individuals. The results show that CXCL10(\u2212938AA) is always protective whenever it appears, but appears rarely and only jointly with either Fgl2(+158T/*) or HO-1(\u2212497A/*), while (Fgl2)(+158T/*) is associated with higher susceptibility unless combined with CXCL10/IP-10(\u2212938AA), when jointly is associated with lower susceptibility. The novel modeling approach proposed, which does not require sizable case and control gene datasets, could have important future public health implications in swiftly identifying potential high-risk groups associated with being highly susceptible to a particular infectious disease.",

This is particularly true in the cases of emerging infectious diseases, e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a new infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that carries a significant mortality rate (Peiris et al., 2003; Tsui et al., 2003) . Possible association of various polymorphisms of human genes has been reported in several studies (Lin et al., 2003; Ng et al., 2004; Sui et al., 2004; Ip et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005; Yuan et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006a Chen et al., , 2006b Chong et al., 2006; He et al., 2006) . Moreover, it has been observed that some people were infected while others in the same environments were free from infection, suggesting a possible role of host genetic factors in susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection (Lee, 2003) . However, in all of these association studies, statistical association analysis was employed where inadequate sample size sometimes weakens the results.",

In a subsequent work (Ho et al., 2008) , the genotyping data were further analyzed along with the duration of clinical illness (number of days between onset of illness and hospital discharge) which found that severity of SARS infection was significantly associated with differences in genotype distribution of three genes: fibrinogen-like protein (Fgl2) at C+158T downstream to the start codon that results in a nonsynonemous amino acid substitution from glycine to glutamic acid at amino acid G53E being a dominant risk variant; CXCL10/IP-10 at G\u2212938A upstream to the start codon with \u2212938A being a risk and \u2212938G being a protective variant; and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) at T\u2212497A with \u2212497A being a dominant risk variant.",

Genotyping of 281 loci of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) located on 65 candidate genes was performed for these cases. Some genotyped cases were deleted for this study due to -6/25, 2003. (Source: Taiwan CDC and Hsieh et al., 2007.) the lack of clinical data, others were omitted so that there are no kinship (parent-child or siblings) among the cases so there is no blood relation among the cases, although there are two couples. The resulting data set is that of 100 cases we will study. Of these 100 patients genotyped, five had died of SARS and the rest had recovered and discharged from hospital. The genotype frequencies of the 100 cases with their clinical severity are given in Table A .1 of the Appendix. Note that genotype data for all 480 confirmed SARS cases in Taiwan is not available due to difficulty in collecting samples, since 85 of the confirmed SARS cases had died and many other who had recovered did not give consent for genotyping. This limitation led to difficulty in carrying out reliable statistical association study for gene susceptibility to SARS, which motivates our present modeling study.",

In order to do so, we make use of a discrete-time compartmental model (Hsieh et al., 2004) , to estimate the infection rate of different genotype groups. The model used in this work is traditionally used to describe transmission dynamics of infectious diseases (Anderson and May, 1991) . Similar modeling approach has been used to estimate the different infection rates of HIV-infected individuals during different stages of illness (Rapatski et al., 2005) . We carried out the model parameter estimation in such a way so that we do not need to distinguish the hospitalized patients by their clinical severity, nor do we make the distinction between infections by infectives of different genotypes. Instead, we only distinguish the infected cases by their genotype, thus address the question of whether their genotype played in part in their chance of being infected. A typical model flowchart with three genotype combinations is given in Fig. 2 (the subscript \"n\" in the model equations, denoting the time unit, was deleted for brevity). Note that from Table A .1, three are three genotype combinations of Fgl2(+158T/*) and HO-1(\u2212497A/*), but only two combinations for CXCL10(\u2212938AA).",

            "text": "For this study, clinical data of 461 SARS patients were used in the parameter estimation, while 100 cases of this group of 461 had genetic data which was used to compute gene frequencies for the model. To summarize our results in words, Fgl2(+158T/*) is a risk variant, unless combined with CXCL10(\u2212938AA) genotype. CXCL10(\u2212938AA) assumes a protective role whenever it appears, but it appears rarely and only jointly with either Fgl2(+158T/*) or HO-1(\u2212497A/*). All results pertaining to HO-1(\u2212497A/*), either by it self or jointly with other genotypes, indicate that its association with SARS susceptibility is very weak one, if indeed such an association exists. Larger genetic data set is needed to further ascertain its validity, either using this modeling approach or more traditional statistical analysis which might be more suitable for elucidating the issue at hand, provided a sufficiently large data set is available. Moreover, our study is mainly observational, where no control group who did not get infected with SARS is considered and other likely risk factors have not been controlled for. Since these other factors could have influenced the patient outcomes as well as key rates in our model such as death, incident, and recovery rates, it might have had an effect on our results. In this paper, we have been conservative in reporting statistically significant difference in susceptibility only when there are no overlapping confidence intervals. Note also that this study does not rule out the possibility that other genes may also be associated with susceptibility to SARS. The model does not consider heterogeneity in contacts, nor do we assign separate compartments for subpopulations such as the healthcare workers. Nosocomial infection played a major role in the SARS outbreak in Taiwan with approximately 80% of the infections occurred in hospitals, out of which roughly 30% were healthcare workers (Ho and Su, 2004) . However, since our gene data consists of only 100 cases including 39 healthcare workers, a further division into smaller subgroups of a handful of individuals would render the estimation results highly unreliable. There also may be other unknown factors of social, biological, or environmental nature, which influence SARS susceptibility but are not considered here.",

There are, clearly, many another factors (e.g., age, gender, social group, etc.) which could affect individual susceptibility to infectious diseases. However, a thorough multivariate analysis which examines all of these factors often requires enormous amount of patient data which is difficult to obtain and typically expensive. A preliminary modeling study of this nature could provide theoretical basis for gene association with particular illness, and to provide justification and unambiguous direction with which more clinical studies can be carried out with appropriate statistical analysis to ascertain the exact association. If a gene association can be affirmed in this manner, it could have important implications for design of intervention strategies for containment of outbreaks, for example, early recognition of those who are most at risk for infection could help disease prevention efforts. Ability to identify those healthcare workers who might have immunoprotection for a particular virus, and who would be most suitable to work and care for the patients in specially designated hospitals for an emerging infectious disease, also could be important especially in times of crisis.",
