Cell attenuated DR13 was orally or intramuscularly (IM) administered to late-term pregnant sows, and mortality resulting from the highly virulent PEDV challenge was investigated in passively immunized suckling piglets of the two different groups. The mortality rate of the oral group (13%) was lower than that of the IM group (60%). In particular, the concentration of IgA against PEDV was higher in piglets of sows in the oral group, compared to the IM group. The attenuated DR13 virus remained safe, even after three backpassages in piglets. The findings of this study support the theory that the Vero cell attenuated DR13 virus may be applied as an oral vaccine for inducing specific immunity in late-term pregnant sows with a high margin of protection against PEDV infection.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a coronavirus, is an etiological enteropathogenic agent in swine (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980; Ducatelle et al., 1981; Wood, 1977) . The virus replicates in differentiated enterocytes covering the villi of the small intestine, leading to villous atrophy and maladsorption (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980; Moon, 1978) . PED occurs in most swine-raising countries in Europe, as well as China, Korea, and Japan. Thus, economic losses from the disease are serious every winter in these countries (Pensaert, 1999; Saif and Wesley, 1999) . Infection is associated with >20% diarrheal cases in neonatal pigs in Korea (Kweon et al., 1999) . Live vaccines for PED are used in Korea (KPEDV-9) and Japan (P-5V), due to the endemic nature of the disease (Kweon et al., 1999; Kadoi et al., 2002) . The efficacy of commercially available vaccines is limited in field conditions, and the protective immunity induced is insufficient. This is directly attributed to the attenuated strain employed, and the intramuscular (IM) route. In a previous study, a serially Vero cell passaged PEDV, designated ''DR13 0 ', with a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern distinct from wild-type PEDVs was tested for pathogenicity in piglets and safety in pregnant sows after oral inoculation (Song et al., 2003) .",

A mixed breed of pigs was employed in this study (Yorkshire \u00b7 Landrace \u00b7 Duroc). All sows from farms A, B, and C, located in the Kyungsang and Chuchung provinces, were serologically negative for PED virus neutralizing antibodies. A number of pregnant sows in the three PED-free commercial farms (500 sows in Farm A; 300 in B; 200 in C) were inoculated orally (O group) or intramuscularly (IM group) with 1 ml DR13 (passage level 100) at a titer of 10 6.0 TCID 50 /0.1 ml, 4 weeks prior to farrowing. A second inoculation with an equivalent titer of virus was administered after 2 weeks. Sows that were not vaccinated with the virus comprised the control group. Paired serum samples before and after inoculation were collected at two-week intervals. Paired sera (2 and 4 weeks before farrowing, and at farrowing) and colostrum at delivery were tested for the presence of antibodies against PEDV using ELISA, as reported previously (Kweon et al., 1999) . Piglets of all groups were housed with their mothers with no artificial supply of colostrum or milk. Thirty 3-day-old piglets were selected randomly from farrowing sows in vaccinated (O and IM) and control groups for challenge exposure with virulent PEDV. Piglets from all groups were challenged orally with 5 ml wild-type PEDV (the virus titer was not determined). Before challenge, sera from piglets were collected for ELISA and serum neutralization (SN) analysis of antibodies against PEDV. Nursing 3-day-old pigs were removed from the sow 1 h prior to challenge with 5 ml virulent PEDV (which previously caused 100% mortality in 3day old pigs) . Piglets from each group were housed in a 1.3 m \u00b7 1.3 m (1.69 m 2 ) pen of an environmentally controlled building, and fed substitute milk. Clinical signs of diarrhea and mortality in challenged piglets were observed for 10 days, and antibody response against PEDV was examined during the experimental period. The duration of PEDV shedding after challenge with wild-type PEDV was monitored using RT-PCR. Twenty-four pregnant sows from the two other farms (D and E) were inoculated orally with 1 ml virus (passage level 100) containing 10 6.0 TCID 50 /0.1 ml at 2 and 4 weeks prior to farrowing. The 24 colostrum samples were collected at delivery from each farrowing sow. Moreover, two colostral samples were collected from control sows of each farm within 24 h after parturition. Serum samples were obtained from the cranial vena cava, and colostrum samples obtained manually from 2 or 3 glands and pooled after IM injection of 1 IU oxytocin. Whey was obtained from colostral samples for use in a SN test. Eight 3-day-old piglets were selected randomly from farrowing sows of farms D and E, and challenged using a similar method. Non-vaccinated sows provided the source of control pigs in farms A, B, and C. Control piglets (Yorkshire \u00b7 Landrace \u00b7 Duroc) of farms D and E (seronegative against PEDV, 1: 6 2 in SN test), which aged at 3days, were provided by YANGSUNG Laboratory Animal Inc (YongIn, Korea).",

PEDV DR13 was isolated through serial passage in Vero cell cultures, and differentiated from the wild-type strainusing RT-PCR RFLP with HindIII and XhoII enzymes (Song et al., 2003) . Moreover, attenuation and safety of PEDV DR13 (passage level 100) after oral inoculation have been reported (Song et al., 2003) . Since lactogenic immunity protects suckling pigs from PEDV infection, induction of mucosal immune responses in lactating pigs may be an effective way of protection. Efficacy studies on similar enteric diseases, such as bovine coronavirus, revealed that the modified live oral vaccine significantly protected calves from highly virulent challenges with newborn calf diarrheal coronavirus isolates (Welter, 1998) . Highly attenuated PEDV (orally inoculated) conferred partial protection against challenge with the virulent virus in conventional pigs. This protection is related to the inoculation dose, and is enhanced with increasing concentrations (De Arriba et al., 2002) .",

Discrepancies between data obtained with ELISA and SN tests under our experimental conditions are possibly due to the addition of trypsin required for PEDV propagation, which degrades antibodies (Bae et al., 2003) . The correlation of SN titer and ELISA was described previously (Oh Fig. 3 . Antibody responses from serum samples against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in 3-day-old piglets using IgG and IgA-specific ELISA before challenge exposure ( * P < 0.05). Fig. 4 .

Briefly, the maximum agreement was obtained from the serum samples of 1: P 32 of SN titer, however, the least was from the samples of 1:4 of SN titer. The ELISA has been shown to detect IgG, including maternal antibodies at a very low level. In contrast, the SN test detects both IgM and IgG antibodies. The SN test can detect maternal antibodies once the titers drop to level (1:<16) that are more difficult to interpret because of possible nonspecific reactions that can interfere with the test. The protective effects observed with high titers of IgA and SN from maternal colostrum are consistent with the findings of other reports . High titers of passive serum antibodies in colostrumfed conventional piglets are associated with reduced mortality, following inoculation of virulent viruses. The differences in mortality between the O and IM inoculated groups may be due to the IgA content in colostrum. In fact, the IgA concentration before challenge exposure in piglets delivered from the O-inoculated group was higher than that in the IM-inoculated group. The results indicate that IgA plays a more central role in preventing PED than IgG. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between the IgA concentration detected in blood and gut associated lymphoid tissue (De Arriba et al., 2002) . Similarly, Yuan et al. (1996) reported that in pigs orally inoculated with rotavirus, the IgA antibody secretion response in blood was analogous to that in the gut. In piglets, the extent of protection against PEDV is based on the presence of specific IgA antibodies in the milk of immune sows (De Arriba et al., 1995) . After antigenic sensitization in the gut, IgA immunocytes migrate to the mammary gland, where they localize and secrete IgA antibodies into colostrum and milk. This ''gut mammary'' immunologic axis is an important concept in designing optimal vaccines to provide effective lactogenic immunity (Saif et al., 1972) . Sows that are immune after infection with PEDV protect the suckling pigs through lactogenic immunity (Pensaert et al., 1994) . Virus specific antigen stimulation of lymphocytes occurs during intestinal infection in the sow. The stimulated cells subsequently circulate in the body, mature to plasma cells, and migrate to the gut and settle in other organs, such as mammary gland. Secretory IgA production occurs at these sites. Lactogenic IgA-producing cells are thus stimulated in the intestine but produce IgA in the mammary gland itself. Pigs that regularly suckle the immune mother are constantly provided with milk-bound IgA antibodies in the lumen. This passive immunity is related to the presence of specific virus neutralizing antibodies in the gastrointestinal tract of suckling pigs. IgG accounts for more than 60% of the Ig in colostrum. However, IgA is more effective to neutralize the orally infected pathogens than IgG and IgM because IgA is more resistant to proteolytic degradation in the intestinal tract and has more virus neutralizing ability than IgG or IgM (Offit and Clark, 1985) . Accordingly, we performed IgA-specific ELISA to elucidate the relationship between protection and IgA content in colostrum. Notably, variable piglet immunity is observed, according to the degree of colostrum uptake, litter size, antibody uptake, and quality of colostrum (Song et al., 2003) . To determine the specific roles of IgA and IgG in preventing PED after vaccination, the changes in antibody concentrations in milk during lactation require investigation.",

            "text": "The duration of virus shedding after virulent challenge is an indication of the protective level (Yuan et al., 1998; Ward et al., 1996) . Three of the farms selected for the investigation were PEDV-free and the piglets from those farms did not shed PEDV before challenge. Therefore, the virus shed after challenge exposure was possibly the same as inoculum with no RFLP marker. Earlier studies report that complete protection from PEDV infection prevents virus shedding after challenge exposure (De Arriba et al., 2002) . High titers of serum antibodies in piglets are related to reduced severity and duration of diarrhea, and shorter period of virus shedding . Accordingly, virus shedding in piglets was assessed after challenge, using RT-PCR. No significant differences in duration of virus shedding were observed between O and IM groups. PEDV shedding may be variable, depending on the sensitivity of the detection tool. Moreover, shedding may be influenced by the viral strain employed. In the case of cell attenuated DR13, virus shedding lasted for 8 days, and that in sows for 3 days . A comparison of the duration of virus shedding between vaccinated and control groups was not performed due to the death of control piglets after 3-6 days post-challenge. These results indicate that passive immunity by PEDV DR13 does not prevent virus shedding after challenge. Additionally, a study on reversion to virulence was conducted through serial pig passage. Cell-adapted DR13 PEDV remained safe, even after three passages in colostrumdeprived pigs. Accordingly, we propose that cell-adapted DR13 may be applied as a vaccine candidate under commercial farm conditions, although there is rising concern over the possibility of confounding factors introduced by genetic variation or housing variables (Hoblet et al., 1986) . In conclusion, cell-adapted PEDV DR13 prevents mortality after challenge, and induces higher IgA concentrations in colostrum. This elevated IgA concentration may explain the reduced mortality in the O-inoculated group, compared to IM-inoculated and control groups. Further experiments, including lymphoproliferative response and antibody-secreting cells in lymphoid tissue of pigs after challenge, are required to improve PEDV immunity in pigs.",
