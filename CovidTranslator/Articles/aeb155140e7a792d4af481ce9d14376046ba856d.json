            "text": "We have investigated the role of the somatostatin propeptide in mediating intracellular transport and sorting to the regulated secretory pathway. Using a retroviral expression vector, two fusion proteins were expressed in rat pituitary (GH3) cells: a control protein consisting of the/3-1actamase signal peptide fused to chimpanzee o~-globin (142 amino acids); and a chimera of the somatostatin signal peptide and proregion (82 amino acids) fused to ot-globin. Control globin was translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum as determined by accurate cleavage of its signal peptide; however, a-globin was not secreted but was rapidly and quantitatively degraded intracellularly with a hi2 of 4-5 min. Globin degradation was insensitive to chloroquine, a drug which inhibits lysosomal proteases, but was inhibited at 16\u00b0C suggesting proteolysis occurred during transport to the cis-Golgi apparatus. In contrast to the control globin, ,x,30% of the somatostatin propeptide-globin fusion protein was transported to the distal elements of the Golgi apparatus where it was endoproteolytically processed. Processing of the chimera occurred in an acidic intracellular compartment since cleavage was inhibited by 25 #M chloroquine. 60% of the transported chimera was cleaved at the Arg-Lys processing site in native prosomatostatin yielding \"mature\" a-globin. Most significantly, \",,50% of processed ot-globin was sorted to the regulated pathway and secreted in response to 8-Br-cAMP. We conclude that the somatostatin propeptide mediated transport of ot-globin from the endoplasmic reticulum to the trans-Golgi network by protecting molecules from degradation and in addition, facilitated packaging of c~-globin into vesicles whose secretion was stimulated by cAMP.",

To generate a bioactive molecule, the precursors undergo one or several posttranslational modifications including glycosylation, proteolysis, phosphorylation, amidation, and acetylation (9) . These processing events occur in different organelles during intracellular transport and therefore peptide hormone precursors are useful models to study movement through the secretory pathway. Recent observations demonstrate that several sorting and processing events occur in the distal elements of the Golgi apparatus/trans-Golgi network (TGN) ~ and in maturing secretory granules (12, 29, 30, 44) . In particular, endoproteolytic cleavage at paired basic residues is initiated in acidic, clathrin-coated vesicles which bud from the TGN and the resulting mature hormone is stored in secretory granules (30, 31, 44) .",

This type of secretion is designated \"regulated\" or \"stimulated\" (see references 4, 14, and 33 for recent reviews). Hormone-secreting cells also undergo basal or \"constitutive\" secretion whereby nonhormone secretory proteins and plasma membrane proteins are neither concentrated nor stored and are transported in vesicles which continuously fuse with the plasma membrane in a calciumindependent manner (4, 14) .

Current evidence suggests that in the absence of a specific topogenic signal, e.g., for retention in the ER (27, 34) or Golgi apparatus (19) or for sorting to lysosomes (16) , secretion through the constitutive pathway oc-curs by default (14, 36) . Expression of heterologous precursors in different endocrine cell lines results in proteolytic cleavage to the mature hormone and, in some cases, targeting to the regulated secretory pathway; e.g., preproinsulin (26) , pretrypsinogen (5) , preproenkephalin (43) , preprorenin (10) , preproneuropeptide Y (8) , and preprosomatostatin (39, 41) . Since this diverse group of proteins, which lack amino acid sequence homology, can be sorted to the regulated secretory pathway, it is likely that a common structural feature rather than a primary sequence is involved in targeting. However, the identity of putative sorting signals has been elusive.",

The o~-globin polypeptide was chosen as a reporter group for these studies since (a) it is a cytoplasmic protein and is unlikely to possess intrinsic sorting information; (b) previous work demonstrated that attachment of a bacterial signal peptide to the NH2 terminus of tx-globin resulted in its translocation into the ER in vitro and in vivo (17, 40) ; and (c) expression of an ovalbumin signal peptidect-globin fusion protein in Xenopus oocytes led to efficient segregation of c~-globin into the ER but not to its secretion (42) . Here we show that a signal peptide-globin fusion protein (SIG-GLO) was translocated into the ER in vivo, but in the absence of the SRIF propeptide it was rapidly degraded with a half-life of 4-5 min. In contrast, PRO-GLO was transported from the ER to the TGN where it underwent proteolytic cleavage yielding mature u-globin which was secreted into the medium.",

The rationale for these experiments was to determine if the propeptide could facilitate transport of a normally cytoplasmic protein through the secretory pathway. In addition, our aim was to determine if PRO-GLO would be proteolytically processed at the proSRIF ArgLys processing site and if the resulting globin polypeptide would be targeted to the regulated or constitutive secretory pathway. The starting cDNAs for these constructions were plasmids pSP125E encoding the/~-lactamase signal peptide fused to chimpanzee u-globin (40) , and pDWS18 which contained anglerfish preproSRIF I cDNA (13) cloned into the Eco RI site ofa pBR322 derivative in which all four Nae I sites were deleted (Fig. 1 ). After digestion, the appropriate DNA fragments were ligated into the Barn HI site of the retroviral expression vector pLJ (15) and were designated pLJSIG-GLO and pLJPRO-GLO, respectively. Plasmid pLJSIG-GLO encoded the/~-lactamase signal peptide (26 amino acids) fused to ct-globin (40) . Plasmid pLJPRO-GLO encoded the pre-proSRIF I signal peptide, 82 residue proregion, the first amino acid of mature SRIF (Ala), three residues (AspPro-Arg) resulting from the cloning and the complete chimpanzee a-globin chain sequence (Fig. 1 , PrePROSRIF-GLO). We used the expression vector pLJ since the recombinant virions can infect rat pituitary GH3 cells and these cells efficiently cleave native preproSRIF to the mature hormone (41) .",

At each chloroquine concentration (up to 150 #M), a-globin was degraded intracellularly and globin secretion was not observed (data not shown). This result suggested that the rapid turnover of the ot-globin molecules was not dependent on or occurring in an acidic compartment.

By 5 min of chase, >60% of u-globin had disappeared and by 40 min of chase globin was undetectable in the lysate; at no time point was globin detected in the medium. However, when cells were chased for 40 min at 16\u00b0C to prevent exit from the ER, 80-90% of the pulse-labeled ot-globin was still present intracellularly. Based on the rapid kinetics of the o~-globin disappearance, the temperature sensitivity, and the chloroquine data, it seemed unlikely that globin was transported to lysosomes for degradation.",

To determine if a propeptide could mediate secretion, GH3PRO-GLO cells were pulselabeled for 15 min with [35S]methionine and chased for up to 2 h (Fig. 2) . During the 15-min pulse, a prominent globinimrnunoreactive polypeptide migrating with the predicted molecular weight for PRO-GLO lacking a signal peptide (Mr 25,000) was detected intracellularly (Fig. 2, lane I, top  arrow) . A second intracellular, globin-specific polypeptide (Mr 15,000) was detected between 15 and 30 min of chase (middle arrow; Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3) . The appearance of this molecule, which had an electrophoretic mobility slightly slower than authentic c\u00a2-globin (Fig. 2, bottom arrow) , was consistent with PRO-GLO being proteolytically processed at the single ArgLys site in proSRIF generating \"mature\" t~-globin: a-globin with four additional NH2-tenninal amino acids (see Fig. 1 ). Cleavage following the ArgLys was subsequently confirmed by partial NH2-terminal sequencing (see below and Fig. 6 ). With prolonged chase times, the level of Mr 15,000 globin increased with a concomitant reduction of the PRO-GLO polypeptide (Fig. 2, lanes 2-5) suggesting a precursor product relationship. Some unprocessed Mr 25,000 PRO-GLO was rapidly secreted (Fig. 2, lanes 7-10) but most significantly, processed mature Mr 15,000 globin was also secreted into the medium (Fig. 2, lanes 8-10, and Fig. 5 ).",

It is noteworthy that in these cells, the kinetics of PRO-GLO cleavage to c~-globin were identical to those of native proSRIF processing to the mature hormone (41) , suggesting that the chimera and native precursors were transported through the same intracellular compartments at similar rates. About 30 % of the total pulse-labeled globin-immunoreactive material could be recovered intracellularly and in the medium at 120 min of chase.

In general, there is little sequence homology among a diverse array of proteins targeted to secretory granules, thus, it is unlikely that a primary consensus sequence is involved in targeting. Recent evidence, using chimeric proteins, implies targeting to the regulated secretory pathway may be an \"active\" sorting process that contrasts with constitutive secretion which probably occurs by bulk flow (4, 33, 47) . For exam- pie, a fusion between growth hormone and a truncated form of a constitutively secreted viral glycoprotein (vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein [VSV-G]) resulted in transport to the regulated pathway (24) . Although this result suggests that a positive signal in growth hormone confers a \"dominant\" sorting phenotype on the truncated VSV-G protein, the sorting sequence was not identified.",

Computer predictions suggest that proSRIF from several species contains conserved domains (2) which we hypothesize might be important for targeting to the regulated pathway. To investigate this possibility, we expressed two chimeric molecules in GH3 cells: PRO-GLO and SIG-GLO. Both chimeras were translocated into the ER as judged by accurate cleavage of the signal peptide. While SIG-GLO rapidly turned over intracellularly and was not secreted, 30% of PRO-GLO traversed the entire secretory pathway.

The rapid disappearance of a-globin (t~ = 4-5 min) after cleavage of the signal peptide demonstrated that globin alone did not contain sufficient sorting information to mediate secretion. The site of ot-globin degradation was not determined but its rapid turnover indicated degradation shortly after completion of protein synthesis. The lack of inhibition by chloroquine, a drug that inactivates lysosomal enzymes, suggested that degradation did not occur in a lysosomal compartment. Since globin degradation was inhibited between 16 and 20\u00b0C, a temperature which prevents exit from the ER (37) , the site of degradation may be between the ER and \"early\" Golgi regions. However at present, we cannot exclude the possibility that the degradation process is temperature sensitive; i.e., at low temperatures the proteases are inhibited and/or the substrates are less accessible.

We speculate that the propeptide may enhance folding or oligomerization of the chimera which could be necessary for efficient exit from the ER as observed for other proteins (11). Alternatively, the propeptide could facilitate efficient transport by preventing nonspecific interactions which might retard movement in the bulk phase (36) . Once the precursor reached the TGN, sorting could result from intrinsic chemical properties of the molecules rather than a sorting signal per se. For example, during passage through the acidic environment of the post-TGN, a precursor with an acidic pI value might precipitate or aggregate as it reached its isoelectric point. Precipitation, which may require the presence of a suitable cofactor such as a metal ion (e.g., proinsulin and zinc), would result in a highly condensed nucleus of protein leading to the formation of immature secretory granules (30, 44, 45) . In this context, the SRIF proregion confers an acidic pI on both the native molecule and ct-globin. Mature SRIF and a-globin have predicted pls of 9.15 and 9.78, respectively; while proSRIF and PRO-GLO have predicted pls of 5.15 and 6.49, respectively. The propeptide of SRIF therefore may function to initiate precipitation and storage of the prohormone which is subsequently cleaved by processing enzymes activated in the acidic environment of forming secretory granules.",

The obvious candidate for such a protein is growth hormone which is by far the most abundant polypeptide synthesized by and secreted from GH3 cells. However, we recently demonstrated (41) that, in these cells, only 5 % of newly synthesized growth hormone is stored intracellularly in a cAMPresponsive compartment, whereas 95 % is secreted constitutively. Consequently, if PRO-GLO were \"sticking\" to growth hormone, for example, only ~5 % would be expected to enter the regulated pathway. In fact our data demonstrate that \"~45 % of the processed PRO-GLO is stored intracellularly; i.e., significantly more efficiently than endogenous growth hormone. This figure is consistent with the observation (44) that 55 % of processed native proSRIF was sorted to the regulated pathway and secreted in response to 8-Br-cAMP. Approximately 90% of the stored intracellular material was secreted in response to cAMP; equivalent to a fourfold stimulation over the basal level of secretion. This observation is consistent with storage of globin in mature secretory granules. We conclude that the propeptide-mediated targeting to the regulated pathway and facilitated packaging of globin into a cAMP-stimulatable compartment. Morphologic studies are currently in progress to determine the precise cellular localization of these molecules.",

This is noteworthy since a-globin is 10 times the size of mature SRIF and nearly twice the size of the proregion itself; thus, it is unlikely that the chimera and native precursor would be structurally related.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our results have identified two novel functions for a propeptide: partial protection of nascent precursors from degradative enzymes and targeting to the regulated secretory pathway. The SRIF proregion overcame the efficient ER/pre-Golgi \"proofing\" mechanisms and facilitated transport of c~-globin to the distal elements of the Golgi apparatus. The proregion may have afforded protection from proteolysis by allowing the molecule to assume a conformation which (a) is not recognized as \"abnormal\" and therefore is not a substrate for proteolysis; and (b) mediated rapid ER to Golgi transport thus separating the substrate from the degradative enzyme; these two mechanisms probably act in concert.",

After 120 min of chase, the medium was removed and the cells incubated for an additional 120 min in the absence (lanes 4 and 8) or presence (lanes 5 and 9) of 5 mM 8-Br-cAMP. The cells and medium from each sample were then treated with antihemoglobin antisera and the globin-immunoreactive material resolved by SDS-PAGE.
