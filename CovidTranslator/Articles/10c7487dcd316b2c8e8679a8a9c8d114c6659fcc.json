Half of the flock were Cheviots, the remainder were Dorset and crossbred ewes. This barn had been used for lambing in the fall of the previous year. Consecutive groups of ewes lambed in this barn, beginning in January 1992. Ewes and lambs were housed together before weaning. Problems started with suckling lambs from the second lambing period, with almost all lambs showing diarrhea. Diarrhea mostly began at 1 week of age and lasted 3-4 days. By 3 weeks of age, most lambs had recovered. Despite the high morbidity, only two deaths of diarrheic lambs occurred. Thc owner had tricd treatments with oral neomycin, potentiated sulfas (SMZ-TMP) and spcctinomycin, with no apparent efficacy. One 9-day-old lamb from the problem flock was sent to The Ohio State University Veterinary Hospital on 18 March for clinical examination and necropsy. Physical examination of the lamb suggested enteritis and necropsy revealed multifocal small intestinal cryptitis. Fecal examinations by flotation and immunofluorescent assay showed numerous Cryptosporidium oocysts, but no other parasitic infections.",

According to Mitchell and Linklater (1983) , diarrhea in lambs 0-4 weeks of age is usually caused by infections of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ( ETEC ), Clostridium, Salmonella, rotavirus, or Cryptosporidium. Since multiple treatments with several antibiotics and sulfonamides were given during the present outbreak, it is considered less likely that bacterial infections caused the diarrhea. Since lambs usually develop an age immunity to rotavirus by 7 days (Tzipori et al., 1981 c ) , it is unlikely that this agent is implicated in the present outbreak, where diarrhea mostly occurred after 1 week of age. Judged by the high infection rate of Cryptosporidium in newborn lambs and the correlation between the intensity ofoocyst excretion and the occurrence of diarrhea, Cryptosporidium infection was probably responsible for the diarrhea outbreak. Giardia infection apparently did not contribute to the diarrhea, because its infection rate was low and occurred in older lambs without diarrhea.",

Prior surveys, however, were conducted mainly with healthy lambs. Studies with diarrheic lambs rcvealed higher infection rates (Tzipori et al., 1981a; Hiepe et al., 1985; Pavlfisek et al., 1986; Cvetkovi6 and Dimitrijevi6, 1988) . Other factors such as the type of detection method employed might also be responsible for the lower infection rates obtained elsewhere. Most other studies used acid fast staining in fecal examinations. Cozon et al. ( 1992 ) found that acid fast staining stained only 3-13% of the oocysts. Garcia et al. ( 1987 ) suggested that acid fast staining is at least ten times less sensitive than indirect immunofluorescent antibody staining. Similar results were obtained by Weber et al. ( 1991 ) . Arrowood and Sterling (1989) further reported that acid fast staining had only 52% specificity. It is likely that false-negatives and false-positives were present in earlier surveys. The present report used immunofluorescence assays for the first time in a prevalence study of Cryptosporidium infection in domestic animals.",

In that study, diarrhea occurred in artificially reared lambs deprived ofcolostrum, whereas in the present study it occurred in naturally reared suckling lambs. Angus et al. ( 1982 ) suggested that colostrum was protective and reduced deaths in Cryptosporidittm infected lambs.",

Based on this, Angus (1990) suggested that the close proximity of cattle, or the use of grazing land or housing recently occupied by calves, was the main source of infection for many outbreaks of lamb cryptosporidiosis.",

Some lactating and prepartum ewes were excreting Cryptosporidium oocysts, so infection may have been derived from subclinically infected ewes. As the infection in ewes was light, the contamination of the surroundings by them was probably not severe enough to induce diarrhea in lambs born during early lambings. It is possible that amplification of contamination by the infection of newborn lambs had occurred by the time diarrhea began during the second lambing period in this outbreak. A similar outbreak was also reported by Angus et al. ( 1982 ) , in which diarrhea of lambs commenced midway through the lambing period. In the latter outbreak, however, no examinations for infection were conducted in ewes and ewes were not implicated as the source of infection.",
