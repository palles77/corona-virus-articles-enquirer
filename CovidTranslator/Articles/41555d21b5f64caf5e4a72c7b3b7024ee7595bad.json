To investigate the epidemic characteristics of PEDV, the complete ORF3 genes of 14 PEDV field strains from central China during 2012 to 2013 were cloned, sequenced and compared with reference strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete ORF3 gene showed that the PEDVs in central China and the reference strains could be divided into three groups: G1, G2, and G3. The 14 PEDV isolates were classified as G1 and showed a close relationship to some Chinese strains isolated previously in central China and differed genetically from recent isolates from southern China, Korean strains (SM98 and DB1865, 2012), the Chinese LZC strain (2007), and the vaccine strain (CV777) being used in China. Our findings suggested that the PEDVs circulating between 2012 and 2013 in central China might have evolved from earlier strains in the local region. To determine the reason for recent vaccination failures, we also studied variations in antigenicity of field strains by analyzing the three neutralizing epitope regions in the S gene. The results showed that the neutralizing epitopes at aa 245-252 were highly conserved, but most of the amino acid changes occurred in the epitope regions aa 7-146 and 271-278. We speculate that the amino acid mutations in the neutralizing epitope regions may be associated with changes in the antigenicity of PEDV and consequently result in vaccination failure. Together, these findings may be useful for understanding the epidemiology of PEDV and may be relevant for designing of new and more efficacious vaccines.",

In this study, 14 partial S genes from field PEDV strains were amplified by RT-PCR, cloned, sequenced, and analyzed to study their antigenic variation. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of the partial S regions showed relatively high sequence identity among the PEDV strains. In particular, the 14 samples in this study were highly conserved in the neutralizing epitope region aa 245-252, but most of the changes occurred in the core epitope regions of aa 7-146 and aa 271-278. Of these, there were 10 samples with amino acid sequences changes at position 28: from A to V (CH/YF-01, CH/QX-02, CH/ KF-01, CH/LSHAN) and A to S (CH/LY-09, CH/FCH-01, CH/LH, CH/XIP-03, CH/ZHZ-04, CH/HEB). The amino acid sequences in four samples (CH/YF-01, CH/QX-02, CH/KF-01, CH/LY-09) changed from H to R at aa 32, and (Fig. 3) . These changes might alter the antigenicity of PEDV and consequently result in vaccination failure. Further study is needed to confirm the relationship between amino acid mutations in epitope regions and antigenicity, which would help to improve our understanding of the prevalence of PEDV in China. Phylogenetic analysis based on the partial S gene showed that the 14 isolates were separated into two groups ( Fig. 2) , with CH/FCH-01, CH/LH, CH/LY-09, CH/JCH, CH/ZHZ-04, and CH/HEB forming a unique subgroup. Due to amino acid changes occurring mostly in epitope regions, these results indicated that the antigenicity of these strains differed from that of other strains, and these might be new PEDV variants prevailing in central China. Interestingly, although isolated from different geographical areas, two American strains (USA/Colorado/2013 and 13-019349), three Thai strains (VN12258, KU04RB08, and TH/NP-65/12) and one Korean strain (MK) were clustered within the same subgroup with some recent Chinese strains, indicating that these strains from different geographic regions might have similar antigenicity. In addition, one European strain (Br1/7), two Japanese strains (KH and NK), two Korean strains (DR13 and SM98), two early domestic strains (LZC and CH/S), and the vaccine strain (CV777) differed genetically from the other strains and clustered in the group G3 in the phylogenetic tree based on the partial S gene (Fig. 2) .

KF476048-KF476061), including an open reading frame encoding 225 amino acids. These isolates shared 96.7-100.0 % nucleotide and 94.0-100.0 % amino acid sequence identity with each other and had 96.9-99.8 % and 94.5-99.3 % similarity, respectively, to the reference strains. These analyses indicated that the ORF3 gene sequences determined in this study were relatively conserved. Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequence of ORF3 indicated that all of the PEDV strains examined, including the 14 sample strains and the reference strains, could be divided into three groups (1-3). In general, all 14 samples from this study clustered in group G1, together with most strains from China, including CH/ZMDZY/11, BJ-2011-1, JS-HZ2012, GD-B, CH/FJZZ-9/2012, CH/FJND-3/ 2011, and CH/S, and also two American strains (USA/Colorado/2013 and 13-019349) and three Korean strains (DR13, M1595, and Chinju99). G2 included strains CH/HLJHH-2/ 2011, DB1865, DX, ZJCZ4, CH/GDGZ/2012, GD-A, GD-1, LC, CHGD-01, and AJ1102. G3 included SM98 (Korean strain), LZC, and CV777 (the vaccine strain). Furthermore, CH/LY-09, CH/FCH-01, CH/HEB, and CH/LH were clustered in the same subgroup with CH/ZMDZY/11, and CH/ YF-01 and CH/KF-01 were located in the same subgroup with AH2012. Both CH/ZMDZY/11 and AH2012 were collected previously from Henan (2011) and Anhui (2012) provinces of central China.

Furthermore, B-cell epitopes were predicted in the region of aa 7-146 using the BepiPred 1.0b Server. The results showed that there were three epitopes with the highest scores in the aa 7-146, located at positions 22-30, 32-40, 64-75.
