The infection with RBCV was detected in nasal secretions of 86 cattle, and 81 of them developed acute respiratory tract disease, including fatal pneumonia. Cattle nasally shedding RBCV at the beginning of the epizootic experienced characteristic primary immune responses with specific antibodies for hemagglutininesterase (HE) and spike (S) glycoproteins. Virus shedding in nasal secretions of the majority of the cattle ceased between days 7 and 14 with the appearance of HE-and S-specific antibodies. Nasal samples and lung tissues from 9 of the 10 fatal cases had high titers of RBCV, but these cattle had only IgM responses to RBCV infections. Cattle remaining negative in RBCV isolation tests entered this epizootic with antibodies against HE and S. Protection against respiratory tract disease was apparently associated with high level of opsonic and virus-neutralizing IgG2. The HE and S glycoproteins were recognized earliest by the bovine immune system while the N protein induced antibody responses during the later stage of initial infection and the early stage of reinfection. The membrane (M) glycoprotein was the least immunogenic of the major viral structural proteins.",

Shipping fever is an acute respiratory tract disease particularly prevalent among 6-to 8-month-old cattle after transport and entry into feed yards in North America [11, 41] . The role of respiratory bovine coronavirus (RBCV) in SF was previously not recognized. A refined virus isolation scheme was applied in recent etiological investigations. It included the G clone of human rectal tumor-18 (HRT-18) cells, Georgia bovine kidney (GBK) and bovine turbinate (BT) cells with specific permissiveness for currently known respiratory viruses of cattle including RBCV [30] [31] [32] [33] 37] . This approach led to the first successful isolation of wild-type RBCV at high rates from nasal swab samples of cattle arriving at feed yards with respiratory distress, and provided the initial evidence of a potential etiological role of RBCV in SF.",

The 3 end of the genomic RNA consists of approximately 9.5 kb and contains the genes for 5 structural proteins: (i) a longer peplomeric 200-kilodalton (kDa) spike glycoprotein (S) with a proteolytic cleavage site where proteases split S into 110-kDa S1 and 100-kDa S2 subunits, (ii) a short peplomeric 140-kDa hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein (HE) which is a disulfide-linked dimer of 2 identical 65-kDa subunits, (iii) a 26-kDa integral membrane glycoprotein (M), (iv) a 9.5-kDa envelope protein (E), and (v) an internal phosphorylated 50-kDa nucleocapsid protein (N) [1, 7, 12] . Phenotypic and genotypic properties of RBCV differentiated them from EBCV [4, [30] [31] [32] [33] 37] . The distinguishing features are: (i) The RBCV were isolated in the 1 st G clone cell passage without trypsin enhancement. Trypsin activation was required for the isolation of EBCV [36] . (ii) The RBCV have unusually high cell-fusing activities for the G clone cells. (iii) The RBCV have a restricted hemagglutination pattern, and agglutinate only mouse and rat, but not chicken red blood cells (RBC). The EBCV prototypes agglutinate both rodent and chicken RBC [38] . (iv) The RBCV have the highest acetylesterase (AE) activities at 37 \u2022 C while the AE functions of EBCV are more active at 39 \u2022 C [17] . (v) Comparative nucleotide (n.t.) and amino acid (a.a.) sequence analysis of the 3 genomic portion (9.5 kb) of wild-type RBCV and EBCV strains revealed that RBCV-specific n.t. and a.a. changes were disproportionally concentrated within the HE gene, the S gene and the genomic region between the S and E genes [4] .",

The 2 major subclasses of IgG in cattle are IgG1 and IgG2 [2] . Although IgG1 and IgG2 occur in relatively equal amounts in serum and secretions, IgG1 is the predominant isotype in colostrum and milk. Bovine IgG1 and IgG2 fix bovine complement, but IgG2 does not bind heterologous complement [18, 19] . The antibody responses to EBCV structural proteins were studied in 5 experimentally exposed, colostrumdeprived, 20-to 30-hour-old calves that were inoculated orally and intranasally at birth and challenge exposed 3 weeks after inoculation [10] . About 2 to 3 days postinoculation, these calves developed enteric disease signs, and virus shedding was detected in their feces and nasal swab samples for 4 to 9 days and 6 to 9 days, respectively. These calves first developed serum IgM to N and HE at postinoculation week (PIW) 1, and then they responded with IgG1 directed to N and S, and with moderate and slower IgG2 response to N and S antigens at PIW 2 and 3. After challenge of the immunity of these calves by EBCV inoculation, virus shedding was not detected, and calves did not become ill. An increase in IgM to N, in IgG1 antibody reactions to S, HE, M and N, and in IgG2 responses to S and HE was detected. The S and HE antigens elicited virus infectivity-neutralizing antibodies.",

Consequently, we monitored antibody responses to RBCV infections during a severe SF epizootic which was prospectively designed, and included sequential examinations and samplings. These cattle were studied clinically, virologically and immunologically from the initial phases of infection to recovery or fatal outcomes. The investigation facilitated the first comprehensive assessment of currently prevailing respiratory virus infections of market-stressed cattle during a naturally occurring epizootic. A surprisingly high rate of RBCV infections in the virtual absence of other respiratory bovine viruses was detected in the early stage of this epizootic [30] [31] [32] [33] . The specific objectives of this report were to assess the kinetics of total antibody responses of immunologically mature cattle to RBCV infections during a naturally occurring SF epizootic, to define the immunoisotype responses and the antigenic reactivities of the S, HE, M, N structural proteins of RBCV, and to relate these findings with isolation of RBCV from nasal swab and lung samples and development of respiratory tract disease.",

The mixed-breed cattle were assembled on day 0 at an order-buyer barn (OBB), identified by ear tags and clinically examined. Nasal swab and blood samples were collected, followed by vaccination with commercially available modified-live vaccines against BHV-1 and PI-3 (Prevail, Rhone Merieux Inc.), and a 7-way clostridial vaccine (Electroid 7, Mallinckrodt Veterinary Inc.). After a stay at the OBB, the cattle were transported 1932 kilometers to the feed yard jointly operated by the Agricultural Research Service and the Texas Agricultural Experimental Station in Bushland, Texas. Nasal swab samples were taken on days 7, 14, and 21, and blood for serum harvest was collected on days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. Clinical signs of respiratory tract diseases and results of RBCV isolation assigned these cattle into 5 response groups based on results reported elsewhere (Table 1 ) [31] [32] [33] . Response group 1 included 72 cattle that exhibited clinical signs of respiratory tract disease, and were shedding RBCV on day 0, day 7 or both. Seven animals were randomly chosen from each shedding pattern for testing in this study. Response group 2 contained 5 test cattle that secreted RBCV in nasal discharges without adverse respiratory signs. The 10 cattle of response group 3 developed severe pneumonia, and died on days 7 to 11, and 9 that nasally shed RBCV were selected. Eighteen cattle remained RBCV isolation-negative. Eleven of them were included in response group 4 because they had fever and other respiratory signs, while the remaining 7 calves (response group 5) remained clinically healthy during the 5-week investigation. Samples of 7 representative cattle from response groups 4 and 5 were serologically analyzed. Test results of 49 cattle on sequential serum samples were included in this report.",

Proteins in the polyacrylamide gel were then electrophoretically transferred to pure nitrocellulose protein transfer membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) at 100 volts for 90 min using an electrophoretic transfer cell (Mini-Trans-Blot, BioRad Laboratories). Blotted membranes were blocked overnight at 4 \u2022 C with 10% (w/v) nonfat-dry milk in NET buffer. The blot was mounted in a 28 chamber miniblotter apparatus (Miniblotter 28, Immunetics). Twenty serum samples diluted 1:5 were tested on each blot in separate lanes for 1 h at room temperature. Again, serum 1745 and RBCVantibody free serum from a normal calf were included as positive and negative controls, respectively [34, 35] . Bound antibodies were localized after 1 h-incubation at room temperature with HRPO-conjugated, affinity-purified goat anti-bovine IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immunoresearch Inc.) diluted 1:5,000. All dilutions were made with 10% nonfat-dry milk in NET buffer. Antibody bound conjugate was detected using ECL Western Blot Detection System (Amersham Life Science Inc.).

Fifty-six of them nasally shed RBCV on day 0 (subgroup 1a, 1b).

Ten cattle (response group 3) developed severe pneumonia and died from respiratory failure on days 7 to 11. Virus isolations on nasal swab samples proved that 6 of them shed RBCV on days 0 and 7 while 3 had become infected by day 7. The pneumonic lung tissues of these 9 cattle contained RBCV infectivity reaching titers of 5\u00d710 6 plaque forming units per gram. The remaining case was RBCV isolation-negative.

The majority of cattle (response groups 1 and 2) nasally shed RBCV in the early stage of the epizootic. Their initial total antibody levels were low and rapidly increased during the first 2 weeks through brisk responses to HE and S antigens. Increase in IgM appeared first, and was followed by rises in IgG1 and IgG2 as is characteristic for primary immune responses to antigens. Nasal RBCV shedding of most cattle ceased with the appearance of HE-and S-specific antibodies. This relationship between the RBCV infections and antibody responses can be explained by previous findings in EBCV and human respiratory coronavirus infections which revealed that S and HE elicited virus-neutralizing antibodies [6, 26, 27] . These findings differed from a previous report on antibody responses of newborn calves [10] because N-specific antibodies were not detected during the primary immune responses to RBCV infection of these immunologically mature cattle. Based on our virus isolation results and the detected antibody levels, we concluded that most of these cattle became naturally infected with RBCV shortly before they were assembled at the OBB, and that virus spread was enhanced by stressful conditions during transport and associated crowding.",

Seroconversion was observed in calves between the 14 th and the 21 st days after intranasal vaccination with modified-live virus of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) [16] . The neutralizing activity in the serum was low at the 14 th day, but increased by day 21, and persisted for 2 or 3 months. Other investigators studied primary immune responses of seronegative cattle to IBR after intramuscular or nasal inoculations [23, 24] . They demonstrated an early, transient and complement-dependent IgM antibody response followed by a complement-requiring IgG antibody response. Bovine complement component 3 (C3) activation was reported to be enhanced by bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV)-specific IgM and IgG1, but not by IgG2 [13] . In the study of the pathogenesis of BRSV-associated disease, C3 was demonstrated in BRSV-infected parts of the lungs of dead calves, and was suggested to play a role in causing severe dyspnoea [14] . Possibly, RBCV might have induced adverse respiratory signs in a pathological mechanism similar to IBR and BRSV through early primary high levels of complement-binding but non-neutralizing antibodies on RBCV-infected cells. The precise role of complement components in the pathogenesis of RBCV-induced respiratory tract diseases should be studied further.",

Strong RBCV-specific antibody responses against HE, S and N viral proteins had been mounted by the time of their arrival in the feed yard. These findings mirrored the late phase of a primary antibody response to the RBCV infections. Failure in RBCV isolation attempts probably was due to sampling during declining virus excretion. Additionally, RBCV infectivity in nasal secretions might have been neutralized by secretory antibodies through formation of antibody-virus complexes. Secretory IgA against RBCV was detected in nasal secretions of these cattle (data not shown). These cattle may have played an important role in introducing the RBCV into the large group of susceptible cattle in this severe epizootic.",

These cattle had the highest level of IgG2 antibody against RBCV for the entire period of the epizootic, and antigens recognized were HE, S and N viral proteins. The S-specific antibody was more stable and persistent than the HE-and N-specific antibodies during the later course of the epizootic. However, antibody reactions with M protein were sporadically detected throughout the sampling period. The serological response patterns of these RBCV-resistant cattle characterized a secondary antibody response to RBCV, the type of protective immunity induced by recovery from initial infection or by effective vaccination and subsequent challenge exposure. Consequently, it was inferred that these cattle had been infected with RBCV, and had recovered from the infections before they were assembled at the OBB. Solid immunity from the initial infection prevented RBCV reinfection throughout this epizootic.",

The bovine serum IgG1 has a shorter half-life than IgG2 [22] . Studies on the phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus by bovine polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) indicated that IgG2 was opsonic for bovine PMN, while IgG1 was not opsonic, and even inhibited IgG2 opsonization [9] . In contrast to IgG2, IgG1 caused neither adherence nor phagocytosis in vitro by freshly isolated bovine neutrophils and monocytes [18] . Competitive inhibition tests indicated that binding of IgG2 exceeded that of IgG1, although IgG1 and IgG2 shared a common Fc receptor on bovine PMN [19, 40] . Re-exposure of cattle to IBR virus resulted in a booster effect on serum antibodies including a transient IgM response as well as a further rapid increase in IgG [23, 24] . However, secondary antibody responses seemed to be less responsive to complement enhancement of the neutralizing activity. We hypothesized that during the secondary antibody response to RBCV, free RBCV and RBCV-infected cells were opsonized by high titers of opsonic and RBCVneutralizing IgG2, leading to enhanced phagocytosis, more efficient elimination of RBCV infectivity, and thus alleviation of clinical signs of respiratory tract disease.",

            "text": "Remarkable differences were observed in the antibody responses to the major structural proteins of RBCV. The M protein was much less immunogenic than S, HE, and N viral proteins. This observation can be explained by the low molecular mass, structural conformation and inaccessible location of M within the viral envelope. Both HE and S were the viral antigens recognized during the initial stages of the bovine immune response to RBCV infection. The HE glycoprotein induced antibodies earlier than the S glycoprotein. The HE glycoprotein consists of 2 identical, disulfide-linked glycosylated subunits with an N-terminal signal region and a C-terminal anchorage region [15] . The S glycoprotein contains an Nterminal signal sequence, a coil-to-coil structure, and a C-terminal hydrophobic membrane-anchoring domain, and exists as a more stable tetramer. The structure and abundance of the HE protein might favor exposure of epitopes with earlier induction of antibodies. The antibody response to N protein was pronounced during the later phase of the infection when RBCV shedding could not be detected by virus isolation attempts, but a modified PCR detected RBCV genomic regions in lung samples [3] . We hypothesized that the relatively late appearance of N-specific antibodies might depend on the quantity of N in the virions, its structural binding to the RNA genome, and its internal site within the viral envelope. Findings on cell-mediated immunity to mouse hepatitis virus revealed that CD8-bearing lymphocytes influenced recovery from infection with N protein as the major target for cytotoxic lymphocytes [29] . Therefore, HE, S and N proteins should be the major viral antigens to be included in future vaccines for cattle to achieve efficient prevention of RBCV as well as EBCV infections.",
