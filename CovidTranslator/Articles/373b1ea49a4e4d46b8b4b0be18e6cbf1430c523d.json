The cDNA from three overlapping clones was sequenced by the chain termination method and two open reading frames (ORFs) were identified. The largest ORF, 4350bp, encoded a polypeptide of 1449 amino acids of relative molecular mass (M,) 159811, which contained 33 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, a cysteine-rich region, and a potential transmembrane region. The C-terminal half of this ORF showed homology to the S proteins of four other coronaviruses. The other ORF consisted of the 3'-end of a gene with homology to the carboxyl terminus of the F2 subunit of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) RNA polymerase.",

Coronavirus virions contain two membrane glycoproteins spike (S), membrane (M) and a basic phospho~lated nucleoprotein (N). The TGEV S protein has a monomeric M, of 200,000 and has been shown to elicit the production of neutralising antibodies (Jimenez et al., 1986; Laude et al., 1986; Garwes et al., 1987) which are able to confer some protection on suckling piglets (Garwes et al., 1978/79) . Coronavirus S proteins either exist as a single polypeptide, TGEV, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), canine coronavirus (CCV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) or as two subunits, IBV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCV) and haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV). Cavanagh (1983) showed that IBV S2 anchors the protein to the viral envelope via a short carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain and that Sl is non-covalently attached to S2. Removal of the Sl subunit abolished infectivity but not attachment to cells (Cavanagh and Davis, 1986) . In this paper, the nucleotide sequence of cloned cDNA corresponding to the S protein gene, from a virulent British field isolate of TGEV (strain FS772/70), was determined and the deduced amino acid sequence of the S protein was compared to the avirulent Purdue strain of TGEV.",

The 5'-end of this ORF mapped 8180 nucleotides from the start of the poly (A) tail indicating that it corresponded to the S gene present on the 5' coding region of mRNA 2. Comparison of the S genes from FS772/70 and two indepen- asparagine and aspartic acid giving an extra potent&& N-linked glycosylation site. This insertion has also been identified, at the same position, within the S gene sequence of the virulent Miller strain of TGEV (Wesley, 1990) . Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences from the avirulent Purdue strain and the virulent FS772,/70 strain revealed 35 amino acid substitutions, though not all were the same for both Purdue sequences (Fig. 1) . Conservative amino acid substitutions accounted for 23 of the 35 substitutions. It is interesting to note that out of the 44 amino acid substitutions between all four TGEV sequences 19 involved amino acids that were identical for the two virulent strains of TGEV but different from those found in the two independent Purdue sequences. Analysis of the FS772/70 S protein amino acid sequence identified a 16 amino acid N-terminal membrane signal sequence with the cleavage site between the glycine (16) and aspartic acid (17) residues (score = 7.98; von Heijne, 1986) and a C-terminal hydrophobic region corresponding to the transmembrane anchor region. There are 33 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Thr or Asn-X-Ser), of which 27 (82%) are Asn-X-Thr, mainly distributed over the N-terminal half of the molecule but with a group of 7 potential sites between amino acid residues 1293-1374 (Fig. 1) . Dotmatrix analysis showed that the polypeptide had homology, at the carboxyl half of the molecule, to the S proteins from the coronaviruses IBV Beaudette (Binns et al., 1985) (Boursnell et al., 1987) , by dot-matrix analysis [DIAGON; (Staden, 1982) ).

            "text": "The amino acid substitutions identified between virulent and avirulent sequences may lead to the identification of differences between antigenic determinants. A region on the avirulent Purdue-115 S sequence, SSFFSYGEI (site C), has been identified as a linear monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding site (Delmas et al., 1990) , with residues FSY critical for the binding of two neutralising mAbs. Posthumus et al. (1990) showed that amino acid substitutions in the sequence, FFSYGEI, confirmed this as the primary determinant for neutralising mAbs and showed that the two Phe and the Ser, Gly and Glu residues were critical for the binding of both neutralising and non-neutralising mAbs. Delmas et al. (1990) have shown that mAbs which react with the Purdue site C do not react with the S protein from FS772/70. Comparison of this epitope on the FS772/70 sequence identified that the second Phe residue on the Purdue sequence was replaced by a Ser residue on the FS772/70 sequence, according to the data of Posthumus et al. (1990) this would prevent the binding of the Purdue derived mAbs to this epitope in TGEV FS772/70. The virulent Miller strain of TGEV also has the Phe + Ser substitution preventing Purdue-derived mAbs to this epitope from binding. The two amino acid insertion found on FS772/70 and Miller sequences was only four amino acids upstream from this epitope and may either induce a conformational change in this region of the S protein or present an extra potential N-linked glycan, both of which could also interfere with antibody binding. If the Phe -+ Ser substitution and the two amino acid insertion are features of all virulent TGEV strains it is highly unlikely that this linear epitope will be of any value in vaccine regimes, incorporating avirulent strains, for protection against virulent TGEV infections. It is also significant that polyclonal sera from pigs inoculated with the Purdue strain of TGEV did not recognise this epitope (Posthumus et al., 1990 ). S proteins from coronaviruses antigeni~ally distinct from TGEV such as MHV, IBV, BCV and HEV are post-translationally cleaved. The S protein from TGEV and from coronaviruses antigenically related such as FIPV, CCV and the recently isolated PRCV are not cleaved. The sequence DMTRG is found at residue 784 on the FS772/70 sequence and is similar to the sequences DRTRG and ERTRG, found on the Purdue (Rasschaert and Laude, 1987 ) and FIPV 79-1146 (De Groot et al., 1987 S sequences and were postulated to be reminiscent of the S protein cleavage sites. Division of the TGEV S protein, at the DMTRG site, showed there were 20 potential N-glycosylation sites and 23 amino acid substitutions, of which 16 are conservative, within the amino terminal half when comparing the virulent and avirulent strains of TGEV. Comparison of the S proteins from TGEV, FIPV, MHV, BCV and IBV revealed sequences with high homology (Fig. 1) (Britton et al., 1988a), M (Britton et al., 198813) and the genome between the S and M genes (Britton et al., 1989) , provides a complete set of sequence data, from the poly (A)-tail to the 3'-end of the polymerase gene, for a virulent field isolate of TGEV. The order of the viral genes from the FS772/70 strain of TGEV is 5'-[Pol-S-3a-3b-4-M-N-7]-3', where ORFs 3a, 3b and 4 (formerly ORFs 1, 2 and 3; Britton et al., 1989) are potential genes whose products have yet to be confirmed. ORF-7 (formerly ORF 4; Britton et al., 1988a) ,, whose product has been detected in virus infected cells (Garwes et al., 1989) has high homology to a penultimate ORF in FIPV (De Groat et al., 1988) . The identification of an incomplete ORF, 5' to the TGEV S gene, showing homology to the F2 subunit of the IBV polymerase, indicated that there are no extra gene sequences in this region of the TGEV genome, in contrast to other Martian coronaviruses BCV and MHV where other genes or pseudogenes are present, possibly resulting from recombination events.",
