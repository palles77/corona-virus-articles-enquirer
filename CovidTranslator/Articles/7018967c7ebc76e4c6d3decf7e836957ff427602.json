Material and methods: This diagnostic study was conducted from January 2014 until June 2015 in three major educational medical centers, Tehran, Iran. For patients selected with diagnosis of septic shock, peripheral blood sample was taken for testing the VBG parameters and the anion gap (AG) was calculated. All the mentioned parameters were measured again after infusion of 500 cc of normal saline 0.9% in about 1 h. Results: Totally, 93 patients with septic shock were enrolled, 63 male and 30 female. The mean age was 72.53 \u00b1 13.03 and the mean Shock Index (SI) before fluid therapy was 0.79 \u00b1 0.30. AG and pH showed significant negative correlations with CVP, While HCO3 showed a significant positive correlation with CVP. These relations can be affected by the treatment modalities used in shock management such as fluid therapy, mechanical ventilation and vasopressor treatment. Conclusion: It is likely that there is a significant statistical correlation between VBG parameters and AG with CVP, but further research is needed before implementation of the results of this study.",

            "text": "Shock is a true emergency medical condition, defined as inadequate blood perfusion to the body's tissues. This situation causes an imbalance between oxygen demand and supply, and leads to serious damage. 1 Therefore, it definitely needs prompt diagnosis and management, and serial assessments. 2 There are some major categories for better understanding and proper approach to shock including distributive, cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive, and combined. 3, 4 To emphasize the importance of this topic, it should be mentioned that shock usually needs treatment before finding out the exact underlying cause. Septic shock, which is a subgroup of the distributive category, is considered as a common cause of emergency department (ED) visits all around the world. 5 This type of shock needs adequate fluid therapy alongside antibiotic and probably corticosteroid administration. Assessment of the severity of circulatory fluid depletion in these patients, and reassessment of the situation during treatment is crucial and needs a ruler for better performance. Central venous pressure (CVP), along with some other parameters, has been used in this regards in ED. To measure the CVP, an invasive procedure should be performed to insert a central venous catheter (CVC). This procedure needs special preparation, including proper equipment, knowing the coagulation profile of the patient, and an expert physician. It is clear that these properties cannot be prepared in all EDs. If other less-invasive and routine parameters can estimate CVP, management of septic shock will be facilitated. Venous blood gas (VBG) analysis provides some parameters that are useful in this regard. 2 Detailed explanation pathophysiologically connection between tissue hypoxia, hypoperfusion and acidosis with CVP might help for better understanding the aspect. It is obvious that tissue hypoxia resulted from hypoperfusion happens in early stages of septic shock. The anticipated result should be acidosis that could be finding out by VBG analysis parameters. 5,6 CVP measures the perfusion, so it is conceivable to be a correlation between CVP and VBG analysis parameters. This study was conducted to assess the correlation between CVP and VBG analysis parameters to facilitate septic shock management in ED.",

            "text": "Both low and high intravascular volumes are important variables affecting hemodynamic instability that can be associated with poor outcomes; hence, rapid and proper correction of both states through fluid therapy is a cornerstone in shock management. Therefore, fluid therapy needs a reliable, available, and fast measurement tool for estimating the intravascular volume. Despite the wide use of CVP as a tool to guide fluid therapy, there are still some negative points in this regard. 14 Use of CVP implies insertion of a central venous line, which requires specialized health institutions and highly trained personnel, and can be associated with significant morbidities. CVC causes more than 90% of catheter related infections in hospitalized patients. 15 Thrombosis of internal jugular and subclavian veins occur in 33e67% of patients if the catheter is used for more than 7 days. 16 Several studies have doubted the efficacy of CVP as a consistent measure in monitoring shock patients due to persistence of elevated shock index even after normalization of this parameter. 17 In a study by Kumar et al., CVP & pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) failed to prove a significant correlation with stroke volume and end diastolic volume. 18 Also, the use of CVP in evaluating shocked patients can be impaired by multiple confounding factors such as right ventricular dysfunction and valvular heart diseases. 8 Other studies have concluded the superiority of dynamic circulatory markers such as variation in cardiac output, heart rate, and stroke volume, over static measures like CVP and PAOP due to their accurate reflection of intravascular volume. 19, 20 Current study assessed the effect of fluid therapy on VBG, CVP and vital signs through biphasic measurement of these variables before and after first fluid administration following insertion of central venous line. This enhances our understanding of the effect of such therapeutic intervention on different monitoring parameters. The findings of our study are sort of consistent with the results of a study performed by Kaplan et al. on traumatic patients, showing that the initial measurement of pH, BD, and AG at the ED could predict survival in patients with major vascular injury. 21 They also correlate with the results of a pilot diagnostic study by Baratloo et al. which concluded that the correlation between CVP and VBG parameters such as pH, anion gap and bicarbonate can be used to develop a non-invasive tool for monitoring patients with septic shock. 2 Considering the findings of current study and also pathophysiology of septic shock, it could be recommended to pay more attention to such easily available paraclinic findings for shock management in ED. Specially BE and HCO3 that directly affected by metabolic acidosis as a result of shock may be more reasonable.",

A study by Creuter et al. indicated that patients with septic shock showed lower O2 saturation compared to normal controls. 22 The correlation between O2 saturation with hemodynamic and metabolic parameters can serve as a tool to predict the outcome of shock. 23, 24 In the same way, several lines of evidence investigated the correlation between base deficit (BD) and shock index and suggested BD measurements to predict hemorrhage and multi organ failure. 25e28 In this study, we tested the possibility of VBG parameters as monitoring tools by investigating the correlation between these measures and CVP. The correlation was proven statistically, but further research is needed to make this correlation clinically practical. At our study CVP and VBG analysis are given comparatively and the authors believe that researches with larger study population may result to derivation of a mathematical equation so could estimated the CVP based on VBG analysis parameters. If so, it could be used at clinic practice. Even base excess that did not show significant statistical correlation with CVP in current study, could be consider as a valuable parameter for evaluating the process and efficacy of fluid therapy. We strongly believe that assessing the amount of base excess changes (D BE) would be more useful in this regards.",
