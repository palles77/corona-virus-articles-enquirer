The situation was compounded by the unique health-care settings in the Republic of Korea, including crowded emergency departments and large numbers of hospital visitors seeking care at multiple hospitals. 3 To assist with the outbreak response, the Ministry of Health and Welfare of the Republic of Korea hosted several international joint missions that provided valuable information and recommendations for MERS control and prevention of future outbreaks. This report briefly summarizes the missions' outcomes and discusses their positive impacts.",

The Saudi Arabian experts provided an opportunity to better understand the MERS coronavirus through sharing patient care experience. Joint research opportunities on sero-epidemiology for this outbreak were explored after the US CDC team visit. The Republic of Korea and WHO also jointly organized the 2015 International Symposium on MERS to share experience and new knowledge from recent MERS outbreaks and to discuss how to strengthen public health systems in response to future MERS outbreaks and other threats. 12",
