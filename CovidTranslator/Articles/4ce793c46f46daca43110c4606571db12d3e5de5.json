With support of the WHO, authorities in affected regions implemented epidemiologic surveillance and adherence to infection-control procedures, including patient isolation and quarantine for contacts, which helped to contain the SARS outbreak by mid-July 2003. However, there were a total of 8098 SARS cases and 774 associated deaths.",

            "text": "The aetiologic agent of SARS was identified as a coronavirus (CoV) [2] [3] [4] [5] and the genome sequence established it as a novel member of the family 6, 7 . This novel CoV has satisfied Koch's postulates for causation by its consistent isolation from SARS patients, viral isolation, reproduction of disease in non-human primates after inoculation and the presence of specific antibody response against the virus in both patients and experimentally infected primates 8 . All of these remarkable findings were accomplished within a few months of the issue of the WHO global alert on SARS, testifying to the rapid response of the collaboration of the international research effort to deal with such emerging pandemics. The origin of SARS remains uncertain despite closely related CoVs that were recovered from civet cats and other animals in Guangdong Province, suggesting the SARS-CoV could have originated from such animals and implicating SARS as a zoonotic disease. 9 Other members of the CoV family can cause fatal diseases in poultry and laboratory rodents. The two previously known human CoVs cause only mild upper respiratory infections. 10 Despite the 2002/2003 SARS epidemic being eventually controlled by case isolation, there is still neither an effective treatment for SARS nor an efficacious vaccine to prevent infection. 1 The high morbidity and mortality of SARS, as well as the potential of reemergence, make it paramount to focus on future research to develop effective means to treat and prevent the disease should it reappear. Indeed, sporadic reemergence of cases have been reported in Guangdong Province as well as from research laboratories Summary Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease of the 21st century that has pandemic potential. A novel coronavirus (CoV) was identified as its aetiological agent and its genome was sequenced within months of the World Health Organisation issuing a global threat on SARS. The high morbidity and mortality of this potentially pandemic infection demands a rapid research response to develop effective antiviral treatment and vaccine. This will depend on understanding the pathogenesis and immune response to SARS CoV. Further understanding of the ecology of SARS CoV in human and animals will help prevent future cross species transmission. Likewise for the super-spreading events, clarification of the underlying reasons will be important to prevent a large scale outbreak of SARS. Lastly it is of utmost importance that international research collaboration should be strengthened to deal with SARS and any other emerging infectious disease that can seriously threaten our future. \u00df 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

At present, the treatment is largely empirical and therefore controversial, ranging from supportive therapy without intervention to a combination of antivirals and steroids. A recent report on an open trial of a combination of a protease inhibitor and a nucleoside analogue against a historical control suggests a favourable clinical response using lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin. 13 However, controversy remains as no controlled studies have been undertaken, and there is a need to set up international clinical trial networks to develop and perform clinical protocols should SARS reappear.",

            "text": "The future research priorities in SARS therapeutics should focus on antiviral drug screening as no clinically proven candidates exist. A high-throughput screening assay has to be developed and applied to the existing drug candidate libraries. 11 Some in vitro activity against SARS CoV was observed with certain preparations of interferona as well as with glycyrrhizin. 14, 15 In vivo activity has also been demonstrated with interferon-a in a non-human primate model but there have been no studies in humans. 16 Molecular studies of SARS CoV and other coronaviruses suggest several potential molecular targets for antiviral drugs. These include viral binding, fusion and other activities mediated by the glycoprotein spike on the CoV surface, as well as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the cysteine protease. 11 The identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a functional receptor for the SARS CoV has opened up possibilities of treatment strategies such as interference of binding or fusion of SARS CoV with target cells. 17, 18 The SARS CoV has surface spike (S) proteins which contain the S1 and S2 domains; the ACE2, which is a metallopeptidase, binds the S1 domain of the SARS CoV S protein efficiently and anti-ACE2 has been shown to block SARS CoV replication in vitro using Vero E6 cells as an experimental model. 17 A number of antibodies, peptides and small compounds can bind to ACE2 and it is possible that some of these can be useful in the treatment of SARS, 19 either by blocking the S-protein-binding site or by inducing a conformation in ACE2 that is not favourable to binding or fusion. A soluble form of the ACE2 may slow viral replication in an infected individual. 17 Recently, a human monoclonal antibody 80R, against S1 domain of the SARS CoV, has been developed that can potently neutralise SARS CoV infection and efficiently inhibit syncytia formation through blocking of receptor binding. 20 This monoclonal antibody can be used as an immediate treatment strategy for emergency prophylaxis and treatment of SARS, while the more time-consuming development of vaccines and new drugs is underway.",

The mechanism through which the SARS CoV precipitates such lymphopaenia so rapidly is unclear but could be related to immunologic trigger of apoptosis of uninfected lymphocytes. Elucidation of the underlying mechanism may help design treatment strategies.",

            "text": "The initial increase in viral load in the first 10 days of disease 12 also suggests that the role of innate immunity as a first-line defence is important and may influence the subsequent disease progression. It is important to identify the host innate immune response genetics that are predictors of disease susceptibility and progression. This would help to improve prognostic capabilities and allow identification of patients likely to benefit from aggressive interventions. Such information is also of value in the development of entry criteria for interventional studies. 11 Since immune response might play a role in SARS pathogenesis, one must be cautious of the possibility of enhancement of the disease in immunised subjects. 27 This has indeed occurred for experimental vaccine directed against feline infectious peritonitis virus, which is also a coronavirus. Therefore caution has been urged on developing SARS vaccines. 27 However, given the urgent need for a safe and effective SARS vaccine, multiple strategies for vaccine development have been pursued simultaneously. At least 10 candidate SARS vaccines are at different phases of development. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] These include the development of live-attenuated and inactivated virus vaccine, in addition to other strategies that elicit strong T cell responses, such as DNA-based vaccine and engineered adenovirus vectors, as well as those that elicit production of neutralising antibodies. 11 Subunit vaccines based on S protein fragments and peptides are also being developed. SARS CoV S protein, expressed by attenuated vaccinia virus, has been shown to immunise mice protectively. 30 Similarly, a DNA vaccine encoding the SARS CoV S protein can induce T cell and neutralising antibody responses, as well as protective immunity, in a mouse model. 31 Viral replication can be reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these S plasmid DNA expression vectors and protection is mediated by a humoral but not a T-cell-dependent immune mechanism. 31 All the experimental testing of candidate SARS vaccines would require an animal model that reproduces SARS symptoms and pathology as in humans. However, no animal model described to date can reliably mimic the respiratory symptoms seen in humans with SARS. 27 Even the macaques model, used initially to fulfil the last of Koch's postulates in confirming SARS CoV as the etiologic agent, 8 does not always reproduce the SARS-like symptoms when infected with SARS CoV. 27 This could be due to macaques not being inbred like mice. Finding a consistent SARS animal model which can be used for testing potential drugs and vaccines is certainly a top research priority. Monkey, mouse and ferret have all been used as animal models for answering different research questions.",
