As the key protein for CDV, H is used for attachment to cell receptors as the first step of infection and mediates adequate host immune response [9] . The H protein is considered to have the highest antigenic variation and can reflect genetic changes in comparative studies of CDV strains [10] [11] [12] [13] . This variation may affect neutralization-related sites with disruption of important epitopes. Analysis of CDV strains from different animal species and geographical settings has revealed that the geographic pattern is an important factor in the genetic/antigenic drift affecting the H gene/glycoprotein of CDV [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Therefore, the H gene may be used for identification and phylogenetic classification of CDV strains, which have been identified into seven major genetic lineages, namely America-1 and -2, Asia-1 and -2, Arcticlike, Europe, and wild-life [21, 22] , as well as an indication of the antigenic response of the virus.",

The N protein has immunosuppressive properties and is the major component of the CDV virion. The N-terminal domain of the N protein is generally well conserved, while the C-terminal end is poorly conserved and is considered hypervariable. The C-terminal tail of the N protein also contains the majority of its phosphorylation sites and antigenic sites [23, 24] . During active infection, antibodies made against the N protein in the host are predominant and account for most of the complement-fixing antibody [25, 26] . The P protein is relatively well conserved and plays a vital role in transcription and replication [27] . This protein is an essential component of the viral RNA phosphoprotein complex (vRNAP) [28] and also function as a chaperone for the N protein. The F protein is a type I integral membrane protein that mediates viral penetration by fusion between the virion envelope and the host cell plasma membrane at neutral pH. It is synthesized as an inactive precursor, F0, and must be proteolytically cleaved to produce the functionally active fusion protein, which consists of disulfide-linked F1 and F2 polypeptides [29] . Like the H protein, the F protein has high antigenic variation.",

The virus was propagated in VerodogSLAM cells and the virulence of the strain was confirmed (data not shown). To identify sequence features that may explain the failure of the vaccine strain to protect the dog against CD, we sequenced the entire genome, using two sets of overlapping primers (Table 1) . Within the CDV genome, the H gene is a major causative disease determinant and also has one of the highest rates of mutation. Consequently, the phylogenetic relationship of CDV strains is often based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the H protein. The H gene of the CVT-TM-CC strain has 1,824 nucleotides and the inferred protein sequence has 607 amino acids, similar to the other CDV strains. Amino acid analysis of the H protein from CDV-TM-CC and 20 other CDV strains in GenBank (Table 2) identified seven clades of CDV strains (America-1, America-2, Asia-1, Asia-2, Europe, Arctic-like, and Europe wildlife). CDV-TM-CC was classified into the Asia-1 group with the strains CYN07-hV (Japan), Hebei (China), and HLJ-06 (China) (Fig. 1 (Fig. 2a, b) .",

The phylogenetic relationship of CDV-TM-CC based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the P protein was also analyzed (Fig. 5 ). Similar to the results for the H protein, CDV-TM-CC classified into the Asia-1 group, but was in a separate branch from the classical Onderstepoort vaccine strains.

Distemper vaccination failures are uncommon, but outbreaks of CD continue to occur among vaccinated individuals and populations [4, 5, 36, 37] . The most common factor in CD occurrence is a lack of The H protein, a major structural protein of CDV, mediates host selection and pathogenicity, and the rate of genetic variation for its gene is greater than for other genes. With geographically distinct lineages, many studies have demonstrated that phylogenetic analysis can be carried out in accordance with the deduced amino acid sequences of the H protein [14, 18, 21, 38] . In this study, phylogenetic analysis based on the H protein identified seven clades of CDV strains (America-1, America-2, Asia-1, Asia-2, Europe, Arctic-like, and Europe wild-life), and CDV-TM-CC was classified into the Asia-1 group, with the highest identity to the Chinese strains, HLJ1-6 and Hebei, and the Japanese strain, CYN07-hV. Potential N-glycosylation sites may differ for the H protein of the wild-type and vaccine strains of CDV. Usually, only 4-7 potential sites are found within vaccine strains (such as Onderstepoort), in comparison with 8-9 sites in wild-type CDV strains (for example, 5804P). In particular, the 309-311 N-glycosylation site, which is specific for the wild-type strain [14, 18] , is suggestive of the pathogenicity of the CDV-TM-CC strain. Furthermore, the 584-586 N-glycosylation site has been acquired in the Asian-1 strains [18, 20] . Further study may determine whether these differences in glycosylation The N protein is a highly conserved immunogenic protein that can elicit cellular and humoral immunity [39] . Based on sequence differences between the gene of the wild strains and vaccine strain, the N protein may affect the seroprotection rate of the host and lead to immune failure. Like the H protein, the N protein of CDV-TM-CC showed the highest homology with the Asia-1 group. High homology was also observed with the Asia-2 group (strains M25CR, 007Lm, 011C, 50Con, and 55L) and wild-type strains (164071, A75/17, and 5804P). Moreover, the lowest homology was found between CDV-TM-CC and the Onderstepoort strain. Variation in the immunodominant epitope of the virus may change the structure, and therefore, we can speculate that the T cell-mediated immune response may be altered by variations in this protein. The P gene is extremely well conserved and, therefore, is particularly important in the phylogenetic classification. Based on the phylogenetic relationship of the deduced amino acid sequence of the P protein, CDV-TM-CC was also classified into the Asia-1 group. These results highlight the importance of considering the geographical setting to control the occurrence of the disease in a more efficient manner.",

            "text": "The F protein is a surface glycoprotein that mediates viral entry into the host cell by fusion of the virion envelope and the host cell plasma membrane at a neutral pH. Within the F protein, the signal peptide region (aa 1-135) has the lowest amino acid homology, especially at positions 13-37 and 72-112. However, our analysis shows that the signal peptide region is relatively well conserved among the Asia-1 group, except for specific individual amino acids, indicating that the signal peptide of the F protein is geographically distinct. In addition, three amino acids specific to the CDV-TM-CC strain ( 62 K, 107 Y, and 116 Y) are located in the signal peptide region. The previous study reported that the amino acids 208 K and 216 L are specific for the CDV vaccine strains; however, we also found 208 K in the wild-type strains in the America group (A75/17, 164071, and 5804P) and Asia-2 group (011C, M25CR, 55L,50Con, and 007Lm). The F protein of the CDV-TM-CC strain has six potential glycosylation sites. Among them, differences were found to reside mainly in the signal peptide region, but no clear rule could obviously explain the differences in the wide-type and vaccine strains or the geographical variation, including the occurrence of a strain-specific site (62-64 NKT) for CDV-TM-CC. Four additional potential glycosylation sites were recognized at positions 141-143, 173-175, 179-181 in the F2 region and 517-519 in the F1 region, as reported previously [32] [33] [34] . The 108-110 N-glycosylation site is specific for the wildtype strains (5804P, A75/17, and 164071) and the Asia-1 group (Hebei, HLJ1-06, and CYN07-hV), and may be another important factor in vaccination failure. The fusion peptide (FP) domain also was found to be highly conserved among all CDV strains, except for 233 A/ 233 V in 98-2654 and 98-2646. In short, the genetic/antigenic drift observed in the currently circulating CDV strains should be considered as a possible factor leading to the resurgence of CD cases. Analysis of CDV strains detected globally and from a variety of host species will provide a more in-depth understanding of the global ecology of CDV and will provide the basis for the improvement of current CDV vaccines.",
