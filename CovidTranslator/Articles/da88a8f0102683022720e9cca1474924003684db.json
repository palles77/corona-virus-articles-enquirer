Due to the severity of this disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that manipulation of active viral cultures of SARS-CoV be performed in containment laboratories at biosafety level 3 (BSL3). The virus was inactivated by ultraviolet light (UV) at 254 nm, heat treatment of 65 \u2022 C or greater, alkaline (pH > 12) or acidic (pH < 3) conditions, formalin and glutaraldehyde treatments. We describe the kinetics of these efficient viral inactivation methods, which will allow research with SARS-CoV containing materials, that are rendered non-infectious, to be conducted at reduced safety levels.",

            "text": "In late 2002, an outbreak of unusual life-threatening respiratory disease of unknown etiology began in Guangdong Province, China. This disease was designated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and was later determined by Drosten et al. (2003) , Ksiazek et al. (2003) , and Rota et al. (2003) , to be caused by a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV. Since the identification of coronavirus as the infectious agent for SARS, numerous laboratories have begun research on this virus. According to the WHO, 8098 people were diagnosed with SARS and 774 people died of this disease during the initial outbreak of 2003. Due to the severity of SARS disease and the contagious nature of the causal agent, the WHO website (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/biosafety2003 12 18/en/) has provided guidelines for working safely with this coronavirus. The WHO recommends biosafety level 3 (BSL3) as the appropriate containment level for working with live SARS-CoV, and there is a concern that another SARS outbreak could occur following an accidental exposure in a laboratory. Since the end of the SARS epidemic in July 2003, there have been three known cases of SARS in laboratory researchers due to accidental exposure to the virus (Normile, 2004) . Successful inactivation of the virus allows the transfer of material from a BSL3 to a BSL2 environment and may reduce the risk of accidental infections through unsafe laboratory practices. Inactivated cell-culture derived viral stocks may also be useful for the development of vaccines and the study of their safety and immunogenicity. We examined the efficiency of several methods of viral inactivation, including methods that may inhibit viral replication or entry.",

Other attempts at using formalin inactivation for generation of vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus (Kim (Fulginiti et al., 1967) were not useful, as they induced an aberrant immune response resulting from formalin-induced perturbations of the viruses. Formalin inactivation occurs when nonprotonated amino groups of amino acids, such as lysine, combine with formaldehyde to form hydroxymethylamine. The hydroxymethylamine combines with the amino, amide, guanidyl, phenolic, or imidazole group of amino acids to create inter-or intramolecular methylene crosslinks (for review, see Jiang and Schwendeman, 2000) . Fraenkel-Conrat (1954) observed the absorption spectra of several plant viruses and determined that formalin also binds in a reversible manner to RNA, blocking reading of the genome by RNA polymerase. Glutaraldehyde can also be used to inactivate virus and is used as a disinfecting agent of medical instruments, such as endoscopes (Tandon, 2000) , and as a fixative for electron microscopy (McDonnell and Russell, 1999) .",

Each of the diluted aldehydes was incubated with virus at 4, 25 or 37 \u2022 C. Both of the aldehydes exhibited temperature de- Table 1 Effect pendence in their ability to inactivate virus (Table 1) . Neither formalin nor glutaraldehyde, at a 1:4000 dilution, was able to completely inactivate virus at 4 \u2022 C, even after exposure for 3 days (Table 1) . At 25 and 37 \u2022 C, formalin inactivated most of the virus, close to the limit of detection of the assay, after 1 day, yet some virus still remained infectious on day 3. However, glutaraldehyde completely inactivated the virus by day 2 at 25 \u2022 C and by day 1 at 37 \u2022 C. This suggests that both formalin and glutaraldehyde inactivation of SARS virus may be efficient methods of inactivation, if proper conditions are met. Weismiller et al. (1990) determined that a pH of 8.0 induces a conformational change in the spike protein of the coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which enables fusion of the virion with the host cell. However, Xiao et al. (2003) determined that the spike protein of SARS-CoV mediated fusion with the host cell at a neutral pH. These data suggest that different pH conditions affect the spike proteins of coronaviruses, and the activity of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV may be sensitive to changes in pH, possibly by changing the infectious nature of the viral particles. Therefore, we investigated the effect of different pH exposures on the infectivity of SARS-CoV. After exposing SARS-CoV to extreme alkaline conditions of pH 12 and 14 for 1 h, and subsequently reversing the conditions to a neutralized, buffered solution, the virus was completely inactivated (Fig. 3) . Moderate variations of pH conditions from 5 to 9 had little effect on virus titer, regardless of the temperature. However, highly acidic pH conditions of 1 and 3 completely inactivated the virus at 25 and 37 \u2022 C. At 4 \u2022 C, a pH of 3 did not fully inactivate the virus. These data indicate that the infectivity of SARS-CoV is sensitive to pH extremes.",

While incubation at 4 \u2022 C inhibited the effect of these chemicals, at 37 \u2022 C or room temperature, formalin significantly decreased the infectivity of the virus on day 1, while glutaraldehyde inactivated SARS-CoV after incubations of 1-2 days. As glutaraldehyde is commonly used to disinfect medical instruments, especially endoscopes, care should be taken to analyze time, temperature, and concentration requirements necessary for complete SARS-CoV inactivation. Weismiller et al. (1990) determined that a pH of 8.0 induces a conformational change in the spike protein of the coronavirus MHV that enables fusion of the virion with the host cell. However, Xiao et al. (2003) determined that the spike protein of SARS-CoV mediated fusion with the host cell at a neutral pH. These data suggest that different pH conditions affect the spike proteins of coronaviruses, and the activity of the spike protein of SARS-CoV may be sensitive to changes in pH, possibly by changing the infectious nature of the viral particles. We determined that exposure of SARS-CoV to extreme basic or acidic conditions caused inactivation, while the virus remained stable within a range of neutral pH. The pH of gastric secretions of the stomach ranges from 1.0 to 3.5, while the small and large intestines range from pH 7.5 to 8.0 (Guyton and Hall, 1997) . Taken together, these data suggest that ingestion of SARS-CoV would probably result in inactivation of most virions by stomach acid. However, acidic conditions of the stomach may be partially neutralized by a particularly large meal or antacid ingestion, and under these conditions the virus might have a chance to move through the stomach into the slightly basic conditions of the intestines. Leung et al. (2003) have shown enteric involvement of the SARS virus, as evidenced by the presence of active viral replication in intestinal biopsy specimens from five patients, and the isolation of SARS-CoV RNA in stool specimens up to 10 weeks after onset of symptoms. These data, coupled with the previously mentioned stability of the virus to moderate pH conditions, suggest that the SARS virus may survive ingestion and a fecal/oral route of infection may be possible.",

However, gamma irradiation at the doses tested, was not sufficient to inactivate the virus. As expected, neither viral RNA alone nor virions disrupted by SDS/NP-40 were infectious. These conditions were appropriate for our viral stocks as described, however, we caution that researchers need to test viral stocks for complete inactivation before handling the virus at lower safety levels. These data analyze virus samples in tissue culture medium and we are currently testing the inactivation properties required of SARS-CoV in biological (body) fluids. Understanding the ways in which SARS-CoV can be inactivated, will allow the transfer of the virus from BSL3 to BSL2 conditions, and will promote the study of inactivated viral vaccines.",
