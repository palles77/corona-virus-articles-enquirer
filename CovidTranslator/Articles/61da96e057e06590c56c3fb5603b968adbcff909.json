In addition, a series of AraU monophosphate prodrugs in the form of triester phosphoramidates (ProTides) were also synthesized and tested against a range of viruses, leukaemia and solid tumour cell lines. Unfortunately, neither the parent compound (AraU) nor any of its ProTides showed antiviral activity, nor potent inhibitory activity against any of the cancer cell lines. Therefore, the metabolism of AraU phosphoramidates to release AraU monophosphate was investigated. The results showed carboxypeptidase Y, hog liver esterase and crude CEM tumor cell extracts to hydrolyse the ester motif of phosphoramidates with subsequent loss of the aryl group, while molecular modelling studies suggested that the AraU L-alanine aminoacyl phosphate derivative might not be a good substrate for the phosphoramidase enzyme Hint-1. These findings are in agreement with the observed disappearance of intact prodrug and concomitant appearance of the corresponding phosphoramidate intermediate derivative in CEM cell extracts without measurable formation of araU monophosphate. These findings may explain the poor antiviral/cytostatic potential of the prodrugs.",

            "text": "Cytarabine (AraC, Fig. 1 ) is an anticancer drug used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia and lymphomas, but has limited activity against solid tumors. 1 It is a prodrug that requires conversion to the active triphosphate derivative by cellular kinases in order to exert its cytotoxic effect. Upon the incorporation of AraCTP into the growing DNA chain by DNA polymerases, the chain elongation process is terminated. 2 In this work, the uridine derivative of AraC, that is, AraU (Fig. 1) , was synthesized and investigated for anticancer activity, and in particular its activity versus several leukaemia cell lines was examined. AraU is in fact a metabolite of AraC in vivo as a result of the action of cytidine deaminase, 12 and this is generally regarded as a deactivation mechanism of AraC. In parallel to the mechanism of action of AraC, AraU would most likely have to be phosphorylated to its triphosphate derivative in order to exert any therapeutic effect and this may be inefficient. The phosphorylation of nucleoside analogues, in particular the first step, is believed to be the rate-limiting process for many antiviral and anticancer nucleosides. Thus, a series of AraU triester phosphoramidates (ProTides), which would by-pass the first phosphorylation step, were synthesized and evaluated for antiviral activity and cytotoxic potential against a selection of leukaemia cell lines.",

Upon entering the cell, the masking groups can be hydrolyzed to release the nucleoside analogue/carbohydrate monophosphate, which, in the case of nucleosides, may be further phosphorylated to their di-and then triphosphate derivatives. The metabolism of phosphoramidates proceeds in fours steps; two spontaneous and two involve enzymes. In this work, the two-enzymatic metabolic steps of AraU phosphoramidates were investigated. The first enzymatic step is the hydrolysis of the ester motif of the phosphoramidate, which in this case was studied using carboxypeptidase Y that has been shown to be able to perform the hydrolysis of the ester moiety present in phosphoramidates. 5 Hog liver esterase and crude human lymphocyte CEM cell extracts have also been used in the hydrolysis studies. Secondly, molecular modeling studies were carried out to investigate whether or not AraU phosphoramidates lacking the ester and aryl motifs may be substrates for the Hint-1 enzyme, which is an enzyme that belongs to the phosphoramidase family and has been described to process such compounds to their free monophosphates. 6 2.

To probe whether the ester motif of AraU phosphoramidates is cleaved off or not, carboxypeptidase Y also known as cathepsin A, which has been reported to catalyze this hydrolysis was used in this study. 5 Phenyl-L-alanine benzyl ester AraU phosphoramidate (5) was chosen to be tested.

Upon the addition of cathepsin A, the compound was quickly hydrolyzed to intermediate I (t 1/2 $15 min), which lacks the ester motif (triangle highlight). However, this intermediate did not persist as it was in turn quickly metabolized to intermediate ii via the loss of the aryl motif (circle highlight). Intermediate ii was then consistently present throughout the 3 h of the assay.

Thus, in this study, Hint-1 was used for the docking of intermediate ii to probe the possible hydrolysis of the P-N bond to release AraU monophosphate in silico. Upon docking (see Section 4), the analysis of the different predicted poses showed intermediate ii as having a conformation that would allow the interactions of the phosphate moiety with the key residues in the catalytic site. Although the sugar hydroxyl groups did not correctly interact with the aspartic acid residues, the pyrimidine base did fit in the hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 3 ). Other conformers that retained the hydrogen bonding interactions of the sugar moiety with the aspartic residues showed the sugar ring distorted, and consequently, the base was pushed outside of the hydrophobic pocket, in comparison to AMP (thin red line, Fig. 3) . Thereby, the hydrolysis of the P-N bond may not be as efficient as with purine and ribo nucleoside analogues.

When the compounds were exposed to crude CEM cell extracts for 30 and 120 min, the L-alaninyl and glycinyl araU phosphoramidate prodrugs were converted to their corresponding intermediate phosphoramidate derivatives (after release of their ester and aryl moieties), except for compound 4 (the Dalaninyl derivative) that remained unaltered during the incubation period (Fig. 4) . Also, the speed of conversion of the prodrug compounds 5-8 to their corresponding phosphoramidate intermediate was different depending the nature of the ester/aryl part of the prodrug. In particular, compound 5 was most efficiently converted, followed by 6 and 8. The glycinyl prodrug 7 was the least efficiently converted (Fig. 4) . With the use of purified hog liver esterase, it was ascertained that the metabolites that appeared in the CEM cell extracts were indeed the expected L-alaninyl (for 5, 6, 8) and glycinyl (for 7) intermediates of the prodrugs (data not shown).

Unfortunately, none of the phosphoramidates or their parent nucleoside (AraU) showed significant activity. Metabolic assays using carboxypeptidase Y and hog liver esterase showed the ability of these enzymes to metabolize the ester motif of AraU phosphoramidates, with subsequent spontaneous phenyl loss. Molecular modelling studies suggested AraU Lalanine aminoacyl phosphate may not to be a good substrate for Hint1. In crude CEM cell extracts, formation of the phosphoramidate intermediate was seen for the L-alaninyl and glycinyl prodrugs, but not for the D-alaninyl prodrug. No formation of AraU monophosphate was observed. Thus both hydrolysis studies and docking suggest that the efficiency of the P-N bond cleavage to release AraU monophosphate might be a contributor to the poor cytotoxic activity of AraU ProTides. Taken together, these results suggest that the poor cytostatic activities of AraU phosphoramidates could be a result of inefficient P-N cleavage, though poor phosphorylation to the di-and triphosphates could also be reasons for poor biological activity. This study does suggest that phosphoramidate ProTides may have limited efficacy for arabino nucleosides, although the exact scope of this conclusion needs confirmation.",

The antiviral, other than anti-HIV, assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey cells (Vero), human epithelial cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa), Crandel feline kidney cells (CFKC) or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). Briefly, confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures). After a 1-2 h adsorption period, residual virus was removed, and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or compound concentration required to reduce virusinduced cytopathicity by 50%. Cytotoxicity of the test compounds was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) or the compound concentration that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology.",
