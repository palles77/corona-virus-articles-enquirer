It is worth noting that COVID-19 has a more diverse mode of transmission that can manifest itself as asymptomatic infection [7] , something that has not previously been seen in SARS [47] . Because of the absence of symptoms, it is difficult to detect and isolate carriers in time, which makes it more difficult to control the spread of the disease [47, 48] . Recent studies have found that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the feces of patients, indicating that the possibility of fecal-oral transmission [4, 12] . There have been reports of infections in newborns [2] , but more studies are needed to confirm the presence of vertical transmission. A study of nine pregnant women [2] which tested the amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs and breast milk of six patients for SARS-CoV, all of which were negative and did not support mother-to-child transmission. Human-to-human, asymptomatic infection and possible mother-to-child transmission and fecal-oral transmission are the causes of the widespread spread of the disease. So, the early recognition of COVID-19 in different countries can reduces transmission risk and increases understanding of SARS-CoV-2, to inform national and global response actions.",

Our clinical and pathological review of COVID-19 can help healthcare worker to formulate a timely therapeutic strategy for similar patients and reduce mortality Pathological characteristics SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a sister virus to SARS-CoV, a SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to infect human respiratory epithelial cells through the interaction of viral S proteins and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors on human cells[26, 49]  . Therefore, it is speculated that they may have the same pathological changes. The early pathology of SARS found[50, 51]  that SARS-CoV widespreadly existed in the epithelium of the digestive tract, the epithelium of the distal convoluted tubules of the kidney, and the sweat glands of the skin, suggesting that in addition to respiratory transmission, SARS might also be transmitted through contact between the patient's feces, urine and skin. which also provided a new way to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. In addition, Ding et al[50, 51]  also found SARS-CoV in systemic endocrine gland, Because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have the same mechanism of action, they can cause rapid production of multiple cytokines in body fluids after infection with microorganisms, leading to acute respiratory distress and multiple organ failure. This also explains why most covid-19 patients have mild symptoms at the onset of the disease, while some are suddenly worse after being diagnosed in hospital, which may",
