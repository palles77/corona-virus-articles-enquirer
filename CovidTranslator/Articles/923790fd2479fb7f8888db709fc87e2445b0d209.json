Originally, the use of vaccines was to provide a barrier to infectious agents, such as rabies, that were known to be transmitted between dogs and human beings [2] . As public health concerns were addressed, the use of vaccines to control infectious diseases that cause high morbidity or high morality were then included in vaccination programs [3] [4] [5] [6] . Vaccination has been proved to be the most efficient and cost-effective method of controlling the major infectious diseases in domestic animals [7, 8] . Although we do not normally consider vaccination as way for an animal to become infected with a microorganism, it was originally intended for this purposea planned infection with a known infectious dose of nonlethal consequences. Later, vaccines with attenuated (modified) microorganisms that induced a sustained protective immune response with minimal side effects were used [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

These include (1) routine vaccination of susceptible animals to maintain ''herd immunity'' against endemic or established infections in an area; (2) strategic vaccination that uses emergency vaccination, ring vaccination, and barrier vaccination; and (3) suppressive or dampening-down vaccination. The primary type of vaccination used in companion animals is routine vaccination, because disease prevention in an individual animal is the objective. Forms of strategic vaccination are used in areas that are trying to control infectious diseases in populations, such as in kennels or catteries, however [8] . A further division in vaccines has been the labeling of vaccines based on their clinical importance [4, 7] . Essential, or core, vaccines are those vaccines that are recommended to be administered routinely to dogs and cats to protect them against endemic diseases that have high morbidity or mortality rates. Optional, or noncore, vaccines are those vaccines that are not recommended to be used routinely because the disease risk is considered to be lower. It should be emphasized that noncore does not mean nonessential, however, because certain animal populations are at high risk for disease, such as canine coronavirus (CCV) in breeding kennels [12] , and canine leptospirosis in outdoor hunting dogs [4] .",

The process can include passage of the virus in cell cultures, temperature selection of mutants, and recombinant technology using vectors [4, 7] . Killed vaccines have been inactivated by physical or chemical methods that destroy the infectivity but retain the immunogenicity necessary to induce a protective immune response. The advantages and disadvantages of live and inactivated vaccines are listed in Table 1 .",

Standards for animal vaccines are well outlined, and quality control is highly regulated by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) [16] . Despite this scrutiny, there have been occurrences in which adventitious microorganisms, primarily viruses, have been known to enter vaccine production and become part of the vaccine on release (Fig. 1 ). The ways in which viruses enter into the vaccine production cycle have been reviewed extensively [7, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . They include (1) contamination of the original viral seed stock used to prepare the vaccine, (2) contamination of the cell cultures used in production to amplify the known virus in the vaccine pool, and (3) contamination of the reagents used to propagate the cells being used to amplify the known virus for vaccine production. These are important points to consider and are discussed in further detail.",

Contamination of cell cultures directly by latent noncytopathogenic viruses or indirectly by reagents used to propagate the cells in the laboratory involves several viruses ( Table 2 ). Most common have been bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine and porcine parvoviruses, and bovine herpesvirus (BHV) type 4 [21, 24] . These viruses are frequently present in fetal bovine serum, calf serum, bovine serum derivatives, and trypsin [21] . Although these viruses may have contaminated early serials of companion animal vaccines, there were no apparent serious clinical effects documented, because these viruses did not replicate in dogs or cats or, if replication did occur, there were no symptoms noted at safety testing. An exception to this may have been the association of BHV-4 with urinary tract disease in cats [25, 26] . ",

A common feature was a history of vaccination 3 to 4 weeks before whelping with a modified-live virus (MLV) multicomponent vaccine [27] . Initially, it was speculated that there was a component of the vaccine, such as canine parvovirus (CPV) type 2 or canine distemper virus (CDV), that was not properly attenuated and that because of the immune-compromised state of the dam, the virus was causing disease. Efforts to isolate CPV-2 and CDV were negative. A virus with properties of an orbivirus was isolated in cell culture from tissue homogenates derived from the diseased pups and dams, however [27, 28] . The virus was eventually identified as bluetongue virus (BTV) type 11, a domestic strain of the virus common in the United States [28] . The veterinary biologic manufacturer and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa were informed of the isolation of a potential viral contaminate. In subsequent testing by the NVSL, seed stock virus and repository samples were also found to be contaminated with BTV-11 [29] . The manufacturer voluntarily recalled all vials of the vaccine with serial numbers the same as those associated with the cases. BTV had not previously been associated with disease in dogs but has been well documented as a pathogen of small and large ruminants [30] . The virus is now known to be present in serum products derived from these ruminants, such as fetal bovine serum. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that canine cells are capable of being infected with various serotypes of BTV, including BTV-11, without the cell cultures showing any cytopathologic change [31] . The aforementioned reports emphasized the importance of adding BTV detection methods to cells and virus seed stocks being used to produce companion animal vaccines.",

            "text": "This is a controversial topic and has been debated in the literature over the past several decades [1, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . There are several ways in which the vaccines may contribute to the emergence or re-emergence of viruses in the population. The first is by contaminated vaccines that are used routinely in a large percentage of the animal population. Vaccines that harbor adventitious agents for one species may be pathogenic for another species. Not only may the contaminated vaccine be pathogenic in the vaccinated animal, but it may be spread to other susceptible animals horizontally with the use of aerosols, feces, or saliva, for example (Fig. 2) . Documentation of this form of cause and effect with a vaccine and emerging disease would need a thorough case history and laboratory data. The second way in which vaccines may contribute to the emergence of new viruses is by immune selection of escape mutants (Fig. 3) [35, 36] . Viruses are continually undergoing natural selection because they are obligate intracellular pathogens [37, 38] . The immune response is evolving with the emergence of new viruses [39, 40] . In some cases, it has been speculated that the use of vaccines causes an enhanced immune selection of viruses that evade the immune response, resulting in sustained infection in the population and disease in a certain percentage of the animals [35, 36] . The immune response is a genetically adaptable system to microbial infections [39] . The appearance of new viral infections is most likely manifested first in immunocompromised animals, such as pregnant animals, neonates, and animals that are genetically immune deficient [41] .",

This would include testing that is done on biologics to ensure their purity before inoculation into animals [20, 24] and testing that would be done at the diagnostic laboratory on diseased animals [33, [46] [47] [48] [49] . Virus-specific detection may involve (1) viral culture in susceptible noncontaminated cell lines, (2) viral antigen detection using immunofluorescence reagents, (3) viral antigen detection using ELISA; or (4) viral nucleic acid detection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [19, 22, 50, 51] .",

The disease symptoms were confined to the inoculated dogs, and there was no evidence that further spread occurred to other potentially susceptible dogs in the vicinity. In this regard, the scenario would seem similar to the spread of some viruses to a dead-end or accidental host. This has been well documented for insect-borne viruses, such as West Nile virus, in isolated canine cases [48] . The long-term effects of a contaminated vaccine would be more difficult to document, and would require the availability of diagnostic assays specific for the adventitious virus. Because there is a certain degree of natural cross-species infection (''spill over'') that occurs in the companion animal population, determining the origin of such an infection would require that the referring veterinarian work closely with the veterinary diagnostic laboratory with case history and sample submission (antemortem and postmortem) [42, 52, 53] . Once a virus were to spill over to another species, such as a cat to dog with feline calicivirus [46, 54, 55] , the long-term danger is that the virus would establish the dog as a host, with subsequent virus replication, disease, and further shedding to susceptible dogs. This is postulated to have happened when feline panleukopenia virus crossed species in the late 1970s, resulting in CPV-2 [1, 5] . This virus continues to circulate in the canine population, continues to have minor antigenic drifts (CPV-2a/CPV-2b/CPV-2c) [56] , and has acquired a dual host range between dogs and cats [33, 57] .",

Examples of adverse events that have occurred in the past and how enhanced vigilance at the level of the veterinarian and the veterinary diagnostic laboratory help to curtail these events were discussed.
