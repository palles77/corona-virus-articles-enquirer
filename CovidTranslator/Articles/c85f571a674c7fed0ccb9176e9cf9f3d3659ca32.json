We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters.

For each imputation of symptom onset, we simulated the infection time based on Gamma-distributed incubation period that are have the same mean (5.2 days) and 95th percentile (12.5 days) as previous estimates (Li et al., 2020) . We repeated the simulation until the infection time is consistent with the case's trajectory and known exposure to other confirmed cases. In particular, because infection must be prior to the patient's arrival if we assume all the cases were infected in Wuhan, this allows us to greatly narrow down the infection time. We repeated the simulation of infection time for 100 times and obtained a distribution of infection time for the 46 cases ( Figure 1 ).",

Another report (Li et al., 2020) using the cases in Wuhan estimated the doubling time to be 7.4 days (4.2 days -14 days). These estimates did not fit our simulated distribution of infections well, even with our impossibly extreme assumption of the travel rate (Figure 2, Panel D) .

The previous reports used internationally confirmed cases as of January 28 and the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan. In comparison, we used confirmed cases in 6 selected countries and regions with detailed case reports as of February 4. Our selected countries and regions also have good public health surveillance systems and could more easily identified suspected cases in border control. Another key distinction is that our analysis used the simulated infection time instead of the noisier symptom onset as in the previous analyses. By using the cases' travel history (in particular, international arrival date), we can narrow down when the cases were infected. This reduces the noise in our estimates.",

Our results suggest that the early outbreak of 2019-nCoV could have been spreading much faster in Wuhan than previous estimates. This has important implications in designing prevention measures to control the outbreak in other cities in China and around the world. On the more positive side, our simulated infection rates in January 21 to 23 showed visually significant departure from the previous growth pattern (Panel B, Figure 2 ). This gives some evidence that the prevention measures following the public confirmation of human-to-human transmission in the evening of January 20 were effective.",
