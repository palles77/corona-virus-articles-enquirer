Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the subtype that develops in 10%-40% of patients on mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h [1, 2] . Together, these are the second most common and frequent nosocomial infections among hospitalized patients [3] . Identifying causative pathogens is key to antibiotic choice, differential diagnosis, and epidemiological monitoring. The relative prevalence rates of specific causative pathogens in HAP and VAP vary considerably by patient population, duration of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation, prior antibiotic therapy, and the diagnostic methods and criteria [4] .",

The most common gram-positive bacteria are methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus. The most common gram-negative bacteria are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and Enterobacteriaceae which may be either extended-spectrum \u03b2lactamase (ESBL)-producing or carbapenem-resistant, including Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing variants [3, 5] . Interest has increased in gram-negative pathogens over recent years because they are associated with a higher mortality [6, 7] . Moreover, patients treated in intensive care units (ICUs) with an MDR pathogen prevalence of >25% have an increased risk of developing MDR VAP, regardless of other risk factors [7] [8] [9] . For this reason, determining the frequency of MDR pathogens in ICUs is essential [3, 5] .",

Less invasive strategies, such as endotracheal aspirates or nasotracheal suctioning, can lead to an overidentification of bacteria [9, 10] . Current guidance from the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America therefore states that there is limited evidence to support invasive techniques to obtain respiratory samples in patients with HAP/VAP, instead recommending noninvasive sampling and semiquantitative cultures for most patients [6] . However, the use of clinical criteria and a reliance on semiquantitative cultures can result in false-positive VAP diagnoses and unnecessary antibiotic use [12, 13] . For this reason, the European guidelines of 2017 suggest that accuracy could be improved by obtaining distal samples, with quantitative cultures based on bacterial growth of >10 5 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL for an endotracheal aspirate, >10 4 CFU/mL for a BAL specimen, and >10 3 CFU/mL for a protected specimen brush sample [2] . Thereafter, traditional gram staining, cultures, and antibiotic susceptibility testing is necessary for 48-98 h. This may be too long for patients treated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy [14] and may be sufficient for the emergence of carriage of carbapenem-resistant bacteria to [15] .",

This approach has high sensitivity but low specificity for diagnosing VAP, and a normal chest radiograph may not be completely excluding pneumonia [17] . Although chest radiography is widely used despite this limitation, computed tomography (CT) remains the gold standard. CT chest has the advantage of detecting subtle lung infiltrates, particularly in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which are often missed on chest radiography [18] . Another noninvasive option is point-of-care lung ultrasound, which has gained popularity in ICUs over recent years [19] . Compared with other methods, lung ultrasound is free of radiation, can be used at the bedside and on pregnant woman, allows for dynamic evaluations, is more accurate than chest radiography for detecting pleural effusions, and takes less time [20] . Although visualizing a consolidated region with a linear/arborescent dynamic air-bronchogram had good specificity (81%), visualization of subpleural consolidation has good sensitivity (81%) and limited specificity (41%) [21] . In experienced hands, a normal lung ultrasound excludes VAP [16] . Lung ultrasound can also be used to monitor infiltrates during active treatment [22] .",

Most immunological methods use antigen detection by immunofluorescence, enzyme immunoassay, or immunochromatography. Direct and indirect immunofluorescence are widely used to detect respiratory viruses, but are limited by their qualitative nature, limited sensitivity, and inability to distinguish infective viruses. The immunochromatographic urinary antigen test for S. pneumoniae has a sensitivity of 65%-100% and a specificity of 94% [23] . The urinary antigen test may also be applied to pleural fluid and serum samples, albeit with lower sensitivity (40%-50%) [24] . The most commonly available Legionella urinary antigen assays have a sensitivity of around 80% for serogroup 1 infection (approximately 85% of infections in the US and Europe), but do not detect other serotypes. Advances in urine antigen detection tests for patients with pneumonia mean that new kits show greater sensitivity, can detect S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila in a single test, and can detect pneumococcal serotypes [23, 25] . We have to mention that urine antigen testing has only really been validated in adult (not paediatric) patients.",

Thus, results can be available fast enough to affect empiric treatment choices. GeneXpert systems can detect S. aureus or MRSA from colonies or directly from blood cultures, or from nasal, skin, and soft tissue swabs [2, 34] . GenXpert uses an automated microfluidic procedure that depends on real-time PCR for S. aureus or MRSA, and the BD GeneOhm MRSA uses realtime PCR with a fluorogenic target hybridization probe [35] . A GeneXpert assay for influenza A and B was compared with two commercially available rapid antigen tests and was shown to have excellent sensitivity (97.3% and 100% for A and B, respectively) and specificity (100%, both) [36] . The use of GeneXpert on lower respiratory tract samples from patients with suspected VAP had high sensitivity (98.4%) and moderate specificity (72%), compared with bacterial culture in the detection of S.aureus [37] . \u2022 BD GeneOhm. This assay uses real-time PCR with a fluorogenic target hybradization probe, designed to detect S. aureus or MRSA in respiratory specimens [35] . \u2022 Rapid molecular assays for the detection of S. aureus have major clinical benefit in that they can determine S. aureus colonization status [38] . \u2022 FilmArray Respiratory Panel. Produced by bioM\u00e9rieux BioFire (Salt Lake City, UT), this array integrates nucleic acid extraction, nested PCR, detection, and data analysis in a single-use pouch. It is the first assay to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the qualitative detection of viral and bacterial nucleic acid targets in nasopharyngeal swab specimens [39] . The FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 can detect 17 viral targets and the three bacterial species (B. pertussis, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae) typically associated with pneumonia (Table 1. ) This assay has a turnaround time of approximately 1 hour and has been applied to direct respiratory specimens, including BAL specimens from mechanically ventilated patients [40] . Also, given the multifocal nature of VAP, even mini-BAL samples obtained blindly without the use of bronchoscopy can be effective [41] . More recently, the FilmArray Respiratory Panel has been employed to demonstrate that more than 24% of HAP episodes were associated with respiratory virus infection alone or concomitant viral and bacterial infection [42] . The FilmArray Respiratory Panel has recently been extended to include 24 common respiratory pathogens (including 8 gram-positive bacteria, 11 gram-negative bacteria, and 5 Candida species) with global sensitivity of 78.6% and specificity 98.1% compared to conventional microbiologic techniques [43] . \u2022 The LightCycler SeptiFast. This real-time multiplex PCR assay can identify 20 bacterial and fungal species that account for up to 95% of cases of bacteremia/fungaemia. The assay requires lengthy DNA extraction times of between 4 and 6 hours, so it is not optimized for pointof -care testing as yet. In a pilot study, Baudel et al. [44] suggest that multiplex PCR performed on BAL fluid in critically ill patients could improve the rates of pathogen detection in pneumonia (66%) compared with direct examination (23%) and culture (44%) (p < 0,001). The pathogen identification rate provided by multiplex PCR was not modified by prior antibiotic treatment (66% vs. 64%, non-significant) and remained superior to culture (23%, p < 0.001). \u2022 Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) timeof-flight (TOF) Mass Spectrometry (MS). This is a very powerful microbiological tool that is being gradually implemented for pathogen identification in conjunction with conventional methods [27, 28] . MALDI-TOF MS is a protein/peptide-based diagnostic MS method that relies on the measurement of the molecular mass of all cellular proteins to determine the unique global protein profile that is characteristic of the pathogen. In a study of more than 1000 bacterial isolates, MALDI-TOF MS showed a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 84.1% for sample identification compared with conventional systems, taking 6 min/isolate for identification at a cost of 22%-32% less than that of current methods [ genetic sequences and has been applied to identifying pathogens, monitoring antimicrobial resistance, and typing strains. Simply defined, a microarray is a collection of microscopic features (e.g. DNA) that can be probed with target molecules to produce quantitative (gene expression) or qualitative (diagnostic) data.",

Gram-negative MDR pathogens are typically causative in VAP, with more than 2,000 \u03b2-lactamase genes responsible for resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in these cases Microarraybased assays, such as Check KPC/ESBL (Check-Points), have been used to identify \u03b2-lactamase (bla) genes present in microbial isolates. They do not identify bacteria, but they do provide information about the mechanism of antimicrobial resistance [61] . The assay takes 7-8 hours. Several studies have highlighted the ability of this assay to detect bla genes corresponding to TEM, SHV, CTX-M, and KPC \u03b2-lactamases, and have reported high sensitivity and specificity (100%). In a study by Endimiani et al, for example, sensitivity and specificity of the Check KPC/ESBL assay compared to conventional microbiologic susceptibility testing among 106 gram-negative strains ranged from 96% to 100% [62] . In a follow-up study by Fishbain et al. [63] , when used with a water lysis step, this platform had a 94.4% sensitivity and a 100% specificity in blood culture samples containing ESBL-and KPC-producing pathogens. PCR-ESI/MS has emerged as a technology that is capable of identifying nearly all known human pathogens either from microbial isolates or directly from clinical specimens. With broad-range amplification followed by detection of mixed amplicons, the method can identify genetic evidence of known and unknown pathogens. Starting, when Wolk et al [54] identified the presence of mecA gene and showed very good correlation with MRSA phenotype. Also, the identification of toxin genes(PVL,TSST-1) by PCR/ESI-MS correlated with independent PCR analyses of these genes, Recently, a MALDI-TOF MS-based \u03b2-lactamase assay was shown to be of use in detecting resistance against different \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems [68, 69] . Also, PCR/ESI-MS is currently the fastest MS-based method for diagnosis, producing results within 4-6 hours directly from clinical specimens, thereby bypassing the need for bacterial culture (Table 1) . In a multicenter observational study, a novel and cultureindependent PCR/ESI-MS method was tested in 529 patients [70] . Among the 185 patients with pneumonia, cultures were positive and PCR/ESI-MS was negative in 13 cases; in addition, both were negative in 384 cases. Thus, PCR/ESI-MS was shown to have a sensitivity of 81%, a specificity of 69%, and a negative predictive value of 97% at 6 h from sample acquisition. Independent clinical analysis of the results suggested that PCR/ESI-MS could have altered treatment in as many as 57% of cases [70] .",

FISH can be used to detect pathogens that are difficult or time consuming to identify by traditional methods, especially when more than one species is present, as occurs with polymicrobial infection typical of VAP. For instance, Metzger et al. [73] observed high rates of concordance (81%-95%) between FISH microscopy and conventional microbiologic techniques in detecting organisms in respiratory specimens (BAL) containing target species above and below the diagnostic threshold. Similarly, this technique has been used as a microbiological surveillance method with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97% compared to standard respiratory cultures [74] .",

May et al. [80] also described a novel strategy for the rapid diagnosis of VAP, using exhaled breath condensate fluid from heat-moisture exchangers to provide a testing substrate to identify bacterial DNA by PCR. They showed excellent concordance in pathogen identification by PCR of exhaled breath condensate fluid and pathogens isolated from BAL fluid. Additionally, they found that increasing DNA load among serial exhaled breath condensate fluid samples predicted subsequent VAP. The utility of VOCs produced by respiratory pathogens is therefore of great interest, particularly as a noninvasive early diagnostic tool for HAP/VAP. Serial VOC samples are simple to acquire and may allow for preemptive or targeted preventative treatment of early VAP or tracheobronchitis. A large multicenter European study is in progress to evaluate the utility and performance of VOCguided diagnosis for VAP (BreathDx NTR 6114) [81] .",

Thus, we urgently need studies to be conducted with these new molecular technologies, especially in patients with VAP. The gold standard method for diagnosing VAP must remain BAL samples, but comparison should be made to endotracheal aspirates and to conventional methods. However, this should be done in the knowledge that BAL samples are particularly challenging to work with and that contamination with purulent debris from respiratory epithelial and inflammatory cells may render samples difficult to assay by nucleic acid amplification or proteomic techniques [83] . Additionally, studies are needed that evaluate the clinical utility of rapid microorganism identification via molecular methods with BAL fluid in VAP. In a pre-/post-implementation study, Mok et al. [84] reported that rapid microorganism identification via MALDI-TOF MS decreased the length of ICU stay after analyzing BAL fluid (p = 0.027).",

NATs are more sensitive than gold standard cell culture methods for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses and are more specific than antigen detection tests, including immunochromatographic and immunofluorescence assays [29] . However, these new technologies also have important limitations. They are unable to differentiate colonization from infection, which could be highly problematic in mechanically ventilated patients. They are also unable to give the true susceptibility patterns of the responsible pathogens. For example, although Peptide Nucleic Acid -FISH (PNA-FISH) can provide rapid identification and susceptibility information, the method is limited by its ability to identify relatively few organisms and by being labor intensive in its current formulation [85] . By comparison, MALDI-TOF can identify many more organisms with a comparatively straightforward method. Although nucleic acid extractionindependent assays such as MALDI-TOF MS, microarrays and LAMP are promising, these are currently limited by the limited range of organisms that can be detected. Among the main drawbacks of most of these new techniques are that they rely on qualitative evaluations, they are subject to contamination risk, their costs are often prohibitive, and they often lack validation.",
