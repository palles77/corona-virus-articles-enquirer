It is caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and presented by fever, sore throat and complicated by pneumonia and sever acute respiratory distress. SARS-CoV-2 is singlestranded RNA virus belongs to Betacoronavirus [2] . Different age groups are susceptible to infection, however SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to less commonly infect children and to cause milder symptoms, and are associated with much lower case-fatality rates and most of them recover quickly from the infection [3] .",

For example, varicella, Hepatitis B, MMR, Poliomyelitis, and rotavirus [4] . All of these immunizations together, with special concern for vaccines that result in transient rather than long-lasting as in mumps, rubella, poliomyelitis, Hepatitis B, and varicella build the immunity against SARS-CoV-2 protecting lung cells from invasion. Cross reactivity between vaccination and other viral genus was been stated as that occurred when serum antibodies of HIV emerged after measles vaccination [5] . Most routine viral vaccines are either inactivated or killed vaccines stimulate T Helper 1 cells (CD4+) to secrete many different types of cytokines as interferon gamma, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and IL-12. IL-2 provokes the maturation of the killer T cell and improve the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells recognizing and destroying cells infected with viruses [5] . Another theory for children sparing by COVID-19 could be the low immunity in childhood that doesn't exaggerate the immune response against the virus as adult do [6] .",
