The values underpinning policy are always up for debate and subject to challenge not only by developments in public health science but also by interest groups. In the United States for example, policies on needle exchange programs to reduce cases of HIV, although supported by scientific evidence, have been undermined by political objections (Rosenstock and Lee, 2002) , and in Latin America the development of policies on protection from secondhand smoking have been hindered by the focused strategies of the tobacco industry (Barnoya and Dlantz, 2002) .",

Policy which represents strategic management will rank higher than policy which is task oriented or which defines management functions. Higher-level policies will be of a greater level of abstraction and generalization, whereas lower-level policies, which filter down from strategic policy, will contain more detailed specification. The South African Department of Education has published strategic policy on AIDS and education which makes clear that 'the Ministry is committed to minimize the social, economic and developmental consequences of HIV/AIDS to the education system, all learners, students and educators, and to provide leadership to implement an HIV/AIDS policy' (South African Department of Education, 1999).",

These more detailed policies contain details of the powers and duties which are necessary to meet the strategic policy goals. Policy can exist without recourse to law, although it may choose to use law as a tool of implementation, as in the example above. Policymakers call upon law when policy has been designed for a long-term purpose, when policy programs of education and voluntary compliance are unsuccessful in achieving policy goals, and when the effective implementation of policy requires a heavier hand. The more detailed the policy, the more likely it is that, to achieve policy implementation, the policy will be embodied in law.",

In a common law system, legislation passed by a parliamentary process takes precedence over judge-made law, but where legislation is lacking or is ambiguous, judge-made law may assume the importance of legislation. For example, in England and Wales, the law which regulates the age at which a young person can consent to sexual intercourse can be found in a statute (Sexual Offences Act 2003) , but as there is no statute regulating the age at which a young person can consent to medical treatment; this is governed by judgments of the courts (Gillick v.

Law will reflect but not overtly state values, and any challenge of law in the courts must be confined to a challenge of the process of law and not of the values on which it is based.

At the same time, once law is in place, its amendment or removal requires a new process, and incoming governments may have difficulty summarily overturning law which has been made in response to policies determined by an earlier government. Law's advantage lies in its weight. It is difficult to challenge, it carries with it powers of enforcement by the authority or custom of the state, and it is a powerful influence on the attitudes and behavior of citizens.

Law setting out strategic policy will address the actions of public bodies, including political bodies, rather than the actions of private bodies and individuals. Such law will not generally provide enforcement measures, although public law might enable challenge of actions which contravene law.

The statute provided no specific duties or powers and no enforcement mechanisms, but it made clear how the government intended to proceed and provided a platform for a more focused debate on the nature of the powers and interventions which might be used to protect against tobacco harms. In pursuance of these strategic goals, and after consultation and debate on how the goals could be achieved, the Legislative Council then passed legislation implementing the functional policy interventions the government intended to take to ensure that strategic aims were implemented, such as regulating tobacco advertising and specifying the information which must be contained on a cigarette packet (Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance).

It may initially have been the case that citizens wore seat belts or purchased safety seats because they feared prosecution, but it quickly came to be accepted that the good citizen regarded vehicle restraints as evidence of good behavior. Similar attitudes to acceptability of behavior have been observed after the introduction of smoking legislation. Although it might once have been the case that a nonsmoker would object to a smoker on grounds that smoking invaded the nonsmoker's personal right to clean air, after the intervention of law the smoker in a regulated nonsmoking zone is perceived as offending not against the individual nonsmoker but against society. The smoker's behavior ceases to be an individual nuisance and becomes a public offence, incorporating a moral judgment of the social acceptability of the smoker's behavior.",

Public health policy on tobacco smoke, even supported by extensive public health advocacy and public health education, did little to reduce the incidence of smoking. Voluntary codes of practice have not proved successful ( Jones et al., 1999) . Although it is too early to pronounce on the success of law in reducing smoking levels, there is some evidence to suggest that in places where smoke-free laws are in place, the sale of cigarettes has fallen (Euromonitor International, 2006) , that workers' health has benefited from protection from secondhand smoke (Allwright et al., 2005) , and that law has served to change attitudes to smoking behaviors (Fichtenberg and Glantz, 2002) . Evidence also suggests that citizens in states which lack smoking laws are educated by legal developments elsewhere to question the absence of law in their own state (Pilkington et al., 2006) .",

An attempt was made in the South African Constitution to provide that everyone has the right of access to health-care services, and the constitution imposed an obligation on the state to take reasonable legislative and other measures to achieve the realization of this right. When individuals came to challenge refusal of health-care services in the South African Constitutional Court, the court recognized that the reality of such rights was that they were limited by resources. The state could not be held responsible for the absolute health of any individual citizen, and in an open and democratic society based on principles of dignity, freedom, and equality, the principles of rationing of healthcare provision were found to be integral to a human rights approach to health care (Chinkin, 2006) .",

Law can regulate intentional, reckless, or negligent behavior, for example by criminalizing reckless transmission of disease, or by providing remedies to persons who have been negligently exposed to radiation, or by clarifying the constraints on medical practitioners in their treatment of patients. But difficulties arise where law purports to require an individual to undertake an obligation such as a duty to rescue an accident victim or a duty to stay away from work if an employee develops symptoms of influenza. The problem lies with the extent to which the law can require an individual to undergo a personal sacrifice for the benefit of another. Should an individual be required to put himself or herself at risk of physical harm to rescue another from drowning or from a violent attack? Should an individual be legally obliged to forego earnings so that others can work without fear of infection? Law tends to operate on the assumption that individuals have responsibility for their own safety outside the deliberate, reckless, or negligent actions of others. Workers who wish to be free of infection risk must make the financial sacrifice themselves by staying away from infection zones.",

Most states have formulated vaccination policies which include advocacy programs to encourage vaccination on the premise that in the interests of public good individuals may be required to make some sacrifices. Rarely do states impose compulsory vaccination, although legal challenges to state powers of compulsory vaccination have not generally been successful, confirming that compulsory vaccination may well be a legitimate use of the power of the state to require individuals to act for the benefit of the public good (Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts). Historically, however, attempts forcibly to vaccinate, such as with smallpox vaccination programs in England, the United States, and South Asia, proved counterproductive. Such programs provoked violent resistance and noncooperation, weakened the effectiveness of emergency measures, and caused administrative and financial problems for public health agencies (Albert et al., 2001; Wellcome Trust Centre) .",

Measures other than legal enforcement, such as state compensation for loss of earnings or the offer of free medical treatment, are more likely to produce compliance than the heavy hand of law.

It is common, for example, for public health officials to have the power to isolate persons with infectious disease. If the official declines to exercise that power such that others are put at risk, law rarely provides a mechanism to enable those others to enforce the exercise of the power. This is because the nature of a legal power is such that it incorporates a discretion to act or not act, and responsibility for determining the exercise of discretion lies with the person provided with the power. Rarely do legal systems provide the means to force the official to act, even when significant harm might result from failure to act, for to do so would serve to convert the power into a duty. Had the legislature intended there to be a duty to act, the legislation would have said so. Exceptionally, there might be a remedy when the failure was to prevent a breach of a legally protected human right, or the failure to exercise the power was completely irrational. The Supreme Court of India has recognized that the right to life incorporates the right to the bare necessities of life (Francis Coralie Mullin v. The Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi, 1981) , and that water is a community resource which is held by the state in public trust. This has been held to mean that the state is under a legal duty to protect water sources, and failure to exercise its powers to do so, by for example cleaning rivers and wells, could be challenged in court (M.C. Mehta v. Union of India, 1988). However, in most circumstances policy is better suited than law to directing the exercise of a power, and might well dictate to public bodies a political or social obligation to exercise powers in certain defined circumstances. Policy has the flexibility to respond to changing circumstances and social needs. Law is too blunt and clumsy an instrument for this purpose.",

Functional policies derived from internationally agreed strategic policy are then embodied in national laws. The World Trade Organization (WTO)-administered TRIPS agreement (Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) is an agreement that, among other things, sets out strategic policy on the patenting of pharmaceutical products with the objective of reaching a balance between technological innovation and the social and economic welfare of consumers. In 2003 it was amended by the Doha Declaration to enable developed states to export pharmaceutical products to other states in which there was an identified national health concern, so long as products were not exported as part of a commercial arrangement. The agreement relies on signatory states to then make appropriate laws, and provides justification for state laws which derogate from patent-holder rights in circumstances such as national emergencies. The WHO DOTS (Directly Observed Therapy) is a strategy for tuberculosis control that sets out standardized TB treatment practices, some of which may require legislative backing. Russia, for example, has passed regulations to support TB control in line with the DOTS strategy in order to address its serious tuberculosis threat (Marx et al., 2007) .",

Voluntary agreements for broadcasters on advertising of foods high in fat, salt, and sugar (HFSS) aimed at children, voluntary codes of practice on nutritional standards of school food, voluntary codes on inclusion of nutritional information in food labeling, and voluntary agreements within the retail trade on the pricing of healthy foods have all failed to achieve strategic policy objectives. Food manufacturers argue that unlike alcohol and tobacco, HFSS foods are not intrinsically harmful if eaten in moderation, and that it is therefore inappropriate to make food products subject to regulation. The food lobby is an economically powerful one, and potential loss of revenue from food advertising and food marketing has discouraged compliance with policy strategy. Governments across the world are turning to law to provide more powerful tools to tackle obesity, and some states (for example, Sweden and Quebec) have begun to legislate to constrain the actions of food manufacturers in the cause of obesity prevention.",

Some states are considering a new form of public health law which enables law to serve as a public expression of state public health policy even as that policy evolves to respond to changing public health concerns (Martin, 2006) . The potential inflexibility of law in the advent of new and unpredictable health threats was realized in the face of SARS, and since 2003 many states have begun the process of rewriting their infectious disease laws. Some have attempted a complete rethinking of how law might best serve public health, premised on the notion that contemporary public health practice operates in a framework of risk regulation. Risk is not a concept that has traditionally been addressed, overtly at least, in law, although more recently reforms in environmental law and in occupational health law, both areas with implications for public health, have incorporated risk assessment into their legal approaches.",

What is proposed is legislation which includes, alongside traditional duties and powers, a statement of policies and guidance detailing risk assessment criteria to assist in the exercise of those duties and powers. A similar approach has been suggested in the New Zealand consultation paper on public law reform, which proposes application of its public health laws not only to defined diseases and conditions but to any condition, disease, risk factor, or other matter of public health concern (Ministry of Health, New Zealand, 2002) . The proposed legislation, far from purporting to remain value neutral, would make clear the value framework of law, listing the fundamental principles which would guide any exercise of risk assessment or discretion in exercise of public health powers.",

The new proposals envisage that primary legislation will consist of a statement of strategic public health policy, in that it will express in legislative form the state's policy approach to communicable (and potentially noncommunicable) disease control, together with principles, values, and ethics which will govern exercise of policy. Such legislation might, for example, introduce into risk regulation the precautionary principle, a principle now familiar in the context of environmental law, which would justify public health interventions in the event of serious public health risk even when there was an insufficient supportive scientific evidence base for the intervention. One objective of primary legislation would then be to make clear the state's policy determination of acceptability of levels of risk. The precautionary principle in the context of public health results from a recognition that public health risk analysis is relevant not just at the functional level of policymaking, but also at the strategic level of public policy determination, that it is relevant not just to quantitative risk assessment but also to more discursive qualitative risk, and that it is relevant not only to economic risk but also to value system risk (Steele, 2004) . Subsidiary legislation in the form of regulations and codified rule of practice would then set out details of functional health policy, on the understanding that subsidiary legislation can, within limits, be amended and extended without requiring a full parliamentary process.",

Its importance lies in recognition that the separation between policy and law, which has proved valid in protection against harms with identifiable and isolated causes, may be artificial and unhelpful in dealing with public health concerns which result from manmade risks, lifestyle choices, health inequalities, and social living conditions. Legislation which can incorporate refinement of policy as circumstances dictate, and which can accommodate policy change at a functional level, will provide a far more useful public health tool than traditional public health law. Whether there can be a successful, workable, united expression of law and policy within a legislative document remains to be seen. What is clear is that public health law must be sufficiently flexible to provide a vehicle for public health intervention in unforeseeable circumstances, and the incorporation of strategic policy into the legal framework of health protection might serve both to enhance the status of public health policy and to provide law which better reflects the realities of public health practice.",
