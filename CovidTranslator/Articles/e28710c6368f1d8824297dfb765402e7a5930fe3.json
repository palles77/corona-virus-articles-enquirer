            "text": "The importance of the priming of the lung environment by past infections is being increasingly recognized. Exposure to any given antigen can either improve or worsen the outcome of subsequent lung infections, depending on the immunological history of the host. Thus, an ability to impart transient alterations in the lung environment in anticipation of future insult could provide an important novel therapy for emerging infectious diseases. In this study, we show that nasal administration of virus-like particles (VLPs) before, or immediately after, lethal challenge with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) of mice i) ensures complete recovery from lung infection and near absolute clearance of bacteria within 12 hours of challenge, ii) reduces host response-induced lung tissue damage, iii) promotes recruitment and efficient bacterial clearance by neutrophils and CD11c \u0609 cells, and iv) protects macrophages from MRSA-induced necrosis. VLP-mediated protection against MRSA relied on innate immunity. Complete recovery occurred in VLP-dosed mice with severe combined immunodeficiency, but not in wild-type mice depleted of either Ly6G \u0609 or CD11c \u0609 cells. Early IL-13 production associated with VLP-induced CD11c \u0609 cells was essential for VLP-induced protection. These results indicate that VLP-induced alteration of the lung environment protects the host from lethal MRSA pneumonia by enhancing phagocyte recruitment and killing and by reducing inflammation-induced tissue damage via IL-13-dependent mechanisms.

            "text": "The immune system is a plastic entity, in which the history of prior exposures modulates responses to future insults. It is well documented that the occurrence and even the exact sequence of infections can skew the immune response to a subsequent threat toward an inflammatory or anti-inflammatory phenotype, 1-5 depending on the type of insult, 1,5 its location, 6 and even the stage of host development. 2 The modulatory effect of former insults can be long lasting and can influence the outcome and prognosis of an individual long after the infection has been cleared. 2, 7 For example, acute influenza infection can decrease immune-mediated lung damage associated with subsequent respiratory syncytial virus infection and inhibit replication of vaccinia virus, but it can also enhance replication of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and murine cytomegalovirus. 7 Microbial products, such as CpG, lipopolysaccharide, or other bacterial toxins, can induce protection against a variety of subsequent respiratory pathogens. 8 -10 The homeostatic profile of the lung can also be altered by noninfectious substances. Morphine reduces Toll-like receptor 9 -NF-B signaling, which leads to impaired clearance of Streptococcus pneumoniae. 11 Cigarette smoke down-regulates Toll-like receptor 2 expression on alveolar macrophages (AMs) 12 and inhibits expression of proinflammatory cytokines, 13 which may increase susceptibility to respiratory bacterial infections. Immune imprinting by the nontoxic heat-labile endotoxin (LTK63) of Escherichia coli, delivered as a mucosal adjuvant, induces a transient inflammatory response that reduces inflammation to subsequent type 1 and 2 helper T-cell pathogens (namely, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and Cryptococcus neoformans). 9 Therefore, the ability to transiently modulate the immune environment in preparation for a future infectious challenge, without the need for the induction of harmful inflammation, would be beneficial as preventative and therapeutic treatments.",

            "text": "We have previously reported that pulmonary delivery of a noninfectious, self-assembled protein cage nanoparticle (PCN) induced low-grade inflammation in the absence of tissue damage, yet it enhanced the protection of mice against subsequent sublethal and lethal infections by unrelated viruses, including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, and pneumovirus. 14 This protection is associated with the formation of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) that modulates the local lung environment in the absence of harmful inflammation. 14, 15 PCN is a hollow, spherical protein cage that self-assembles from 24 identical subunits of small heat shock protein, derived from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. Although PCNs are not of viral origin, their small size (12-nm diameter), self-assembled particulate structure, immunogenicity, and lack of genetic material characterize them as virus-like particles (VLPs). 14, 16, 17 Known for their potent adjuvant-like properties, 18 VLPs can enhance immune responses to parental infectious agents, such as hepatitis C, 19 dengue virus, 20 Norwalk virus, 21, 22 or human papillomavirus-induced cervical cancer. 23, 24 In addition, VLPs have been used as a platform for targeting cells 16 and as a delivery vehicle to present the immune system with fused or conjugated heterologous epitopes, 25 and even to induce autoantibodies to self molecules involved in chronic diseases. 25, 26 The work reported by our laboratory adds yet another dimension to the VLP-mediated immune modulation (namely, the ability to induce protective immunity to a variety of unrelated antigens). 14 Invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections result annually in more deaths (\u03fe18,000 cases) than any other single infectious agent in the United States. 27 In fact, the mortality associated with MRSA exceeds the mortality resulting from combined, human immunodeficiency, hepatitis, and influenza viruses. 28, 29 The pulsedfield gel electrophoresis type USA300 is the most prevalent community-associated MRSA strain in United States. USA300 typically causes skin and soft tissue infections; however, it is also capable of causing severe staphylococcal diseases, including necrotizing pneumonia that can transpire in otherwise healthy individuals. 30, 31 In the current study, PCN administration before, or shortly after, respiratory infection of mice with MRSA minimized morbidity and prevented mortality. Major reduction of bacterial burden was observed as early as 8 hours after infection in PCN-dosed mice. This protection was associated with improved recruitment of neutrophils and enhanced antibacterial activity of both neutrophils and lung CD11c \u03e9 cells. The reliance on innate immunity for PCN-mediated protection was indicated by the complete recovery of MRSA-infected mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) dosed with PCN and the significant loss of protection in PCN-dosed wild-type (WT) mice depleted of either Ly6G \u03e9 neutrophils or CD11c \u03e9 cells. Interestingly, PCN-mediated protection was not limited to the lung, because bone marrow (BM) cells from mice intranasally dosed with PCN, but not with PBS, efficiently killed MRSA in vitro. Phenotypical analyses revealed that PCN-dosed mice retained a high M1:M2 macrophage ratio throughout the infection; however, the efficient bacterial killing in PCN-dosed mice was dependent on the early presence of IL-13 and IL-4, in that mice deficient in either of these cytokines had reduced PCNmediated protection against MRSA pneumonia.",

The uptake of bacteria was stopped after 30 minutes, and 40 g/mL of gentamicin was added to each well to kill the extracellular bacteria. Subsequently, total supernatants were removed by aspiration and cells were resuspended in 0.1% saponin solution to allow the release of intracellular bacteria. Wells containing MRSA only (but no mammalian cells) were used as a baseline for gentamicin killing of extracellular bacteria.",

Herein, we determined whether nasal administration of PCN prevented mortality associated with pulmonary MRSA infection. WT mice dosed five times with PCN and rested for a week before MRSA infection, compared with PBS-dosed mice, showed more than a millionfold reduction in bacterial titers in the lungs ( Figure 1A ). At 72 hours after infection with 5 \u03eb 10 7 CFUs of MRSA per dose, we isolated 1.9 \u03eb 10 3 CFUs of bacteria from the lungs of PCN-dosed mice and 1.2 \u03eb 10 9 CFUs of bacteria from the lungs of PBS-dosed mice. Significant decreases in bacterial burden in spleen, liver, and kidney were observed in PCN-dosed mice when compared with PBS-dosed mice (see Supplemental Figure S1 at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). Interestingly, the blood of both PCN-and PBS-dosed mice was virtually free of bacteria up to 72 hours after infection and over the range of challenge doses used in multiple experiments (5 \u03eb 10 7 to 5 \u03eb 10 8 CFUs; data not shown). The reduction of lung bacterial burden directly correlated to survival of all PCNdosed mice ( Figure 1B) . In contrast to PCN-dosed mice, the mortality of PBS-dosed mice reached \u03fe50% at 24 hours after infection, which was directly associated with high bacterial burden in lungs. The mortality rate of PBS-dosed mice was dependent on the infectious dose and varied between approximately 50% survival at 72 hours for PBS-dosed BALB/c mice infected with 5 \u03eb 10 7 CFUs and \u03fd20% survival for these mice when infected with 5 \u03eb 10 8 CFUs of MRSA. In contrast to PBS-dosed mice, PCN-dosed BALB/c mice were entirely protected from MRSA-related mortality in all dose regimens tested (5 \u03eb 10 7 to 5 \u03eb 10 8 CFUs).",

            "text": "To determine how soon after MRSA infection PCN administration began to exert its protective effects, PCN-dosed mice were sacrificed at designated time points after MRSA ( Figure 2 ). By 12 hours after infection, a 10-fold difference in bacterial burden was present between PCNand PBS-dosed mice; by 72 hours, the lungs of PCN-dosed mice showed more than a millionfold reduction in bacterial burden when compared with PBS-dosed mice ( Figure 2A ). This decline of bacterial numbers in PCNdosed mice was coupled with increased numbers of neutrophils and macrophages in the first 12 hours after MRSA infection ( Figure 2 , B and C). Neutrophils were absent in the lung lavages of PCN-and PBS-dosed mice at infection (0 hours). Significantly more macrophages were present in the BALF of PCN-dosed mice than in the PBS-dosed mice at infection. At 3 hours after infection, the numbers of macrophages in PCN-dosed mice remained significantly higher when compared with PBSdosed mice, but were notably reduced when compared with uninfected PCN-dosed mice. This decline was most likely a result of migration of macrophages to the lung parenchyma or more firm adherence to alveolar epithelium, a phenomenon described originally by Sonozaki and Cohen 38 as a macrophage disappearance reaction. In PCN-dosed mice, neutrophils and macrophages remained elevated between 3 and 12 hours after infection, but were reduced by 24 hours (Figure 2 , B and C). After 24 hours, and in compliance with the return of homeostatic conditions in the lungs of PCN-dosed mice, neutrophil numbers were reduced to trace levels, whereas AMs repopulated the lung. In contrast to PCN-dosed mice, the numbers of neutrophils in PBS-dosed mice increased steadily until after 48 hours of infection. The numbers of macrophages in PBS-dosed mice did not start to increase until 48 hours after infection ( Figure 2C ). Bacterial burden in the lungs of PBS-dosed mice reflected the delayed and/or inefficient macrophage and neutrophil responses and remained high throughout the experiment (Figure 2A ).",

In addition, starting at 6 hours after MRSA infection, levels of albumin in BALF of PBS-dosed mice were significantly increased when compared with PCN-dosed mice. This was important because, at 6 hours after infection, no differences in lung bacterial burden were seen between PCN-and PBS-dosed mice. Therefore, the lack of increases in albumin in PCN-dosed mice was indicative of reduced host response-mediated tissue damage in PCNdosed mice. There were no statistical differences in BALF levels of TNF-\u2423, interferon-\u2425, IL-6, and MCP-1 in the first 6 hours after MRSA infection between PCN-and PBSdosed mice ( Figure 2D ). Between 12 and 24 hours after MRSA infection, when the bacterial burdens in PCNdosed mice were significantly less, the levels of these inflammatory cytokines started to decline. However, in PBS-dosed mice, these cytokines remained high (IL-6 and TNF-\u2423) or continued to increase (MCP-1), which was associated with the lack of infection resolution and consistently high bacterial burden in the lungs of these mice ( Figure 2 ). Interestingly, of the anti-inflammatory cyto-kines tested, only levels of IL-13 were significantly elevated in the BALF of PCN-dosed mice, up to 8 hours after infection ( Figure 2D ).",

More important, even though \u03fe90% of cells in the BALF of PBS-dosed mice were CD11c \u03e9 , the absolute number of these cells represented just a fraction of CD11c \u03e9 cells in the BALF of PCN-dosed mice (Table 1) . Early after MRSA infection, the percentage of cells expressing CD11c significantly decreased in the BALF of PBS-dosed mice to approximately 40% at 3 hours after infection and to \u03fd10% at 24 hours after infection ( Figure 4A ). In contrast to PBSdosed mice, in the BALF of PCN-dosed mice, CD11c \u03e9 cells remained at approximately 70% throughout the infection. CD11b \u03e9 cells that were virtually absent in PCNand PBS-dosed mice before infection ( Figure 4A : at 0 hours, \u03fd6% of CD11b \u03e9 cells) increased significantly after infection in PBS-dosed mice (approximately 50% at 3 hours and approximately 80% at 24 hours), but in the BALF of PCN-dosed mice, these cells peaked at approximately 20% at 3 hours after infection and these percentages remained unchanged until 24 hours after infection ( Figure 4A ). Despite their lower percentage, the numbers of CD11b \u03e9 cells were similar between PCN-and PBSdosed mice (data not shown).",

            "text": "In the lungs, cells that expressed CD11c could be AMs and/or DCs. 42 We used multiple staining strategies to distinguish between AMs and DCs, including either differential expression of SiglecF [43] [44] [45] and F4/80 42 ( Figure  4B ) or various expression levels of MHCII 46 ( Figure 4C ). We confirmed that CD11c \u03e9 MHCII low cells were also SiglecF \u03e9 (and, thus, were AMs) and CD11c \u03e9 MHCII high cells were SiglecF \u03ea (and, thus, were DCs; data not shown). When compared with PBS-dosed mice, the numbers of total CD11c \u03e9 cells, and CD11c \u03e9 F4/80 \u03e9 SiglecF \u03e9 AM and SiglecF \u03ea DCs, were significantly higher in PCNdosed mice before and shortly after MRSA infection (Figure 4 , A and B, and Table 1 ). Even though numbers of AMs (CD11c \u03e9 SiglecF \u03e9 cells in Figure 4B ) remained significantly lower in PBS-dosed mice until 48 and 72 hours after infection, the numbers of DCs (CD11c \u03e9 SiglecF \u03ea cells in Figure 4B and CD11c \u03e9 MHCII high cells in Figure  4C ) in these mice increased rapidly at 12 hours after infection and significantly exceeded the numbers of DCs in PCN-dosed mice at later points after infection ( Figure  4B and Table 1 ). M1 macrophages are considered to be the short-term responders to infections, whereas the M2 phenotype is usually associated with wound healing and less damaging chronic inflammatory responses. 47, 48 We observed that, in PCN-dosed mice at 4 hours after MRSA infection, there was threefold more M1 (CD11c \u03e9 CD206 \u03ea ) than M2 (CD11c \u03e9 CD206 \u03e9 ) macrophages ( Figure 4D ). At 8 hours after infection in PCN-dosed mice, the dominance of M1 phenotype was smaller, yet still significant (twofold more of M1 macrophages); at 24 hours after infection, when the bacterial burden in the lungs of PCN-dosed mice was further diminishing (Figure 2A ), the M1 prevalence over the M2 phenotype was fivefold. Contrary to PCN-dosed mice, PBSdosed mice had almost threefold as many M2 macrophages as M1 at 4 hours after infection. At 8 hours after infection in these mice, the numbers of M1 and M2 macrophages in BALF were similar, but at 24 hours after infection, the numbers of M2 cells again exceeded the numbers of M1 cells ( Figure 4D ).",

            "text": "Results described in Figure 4D showed that, in contrast to macrophages in PBS-dosed mice, these cells in PCN-dosed mice were predominantly M1. By applying cell isolation techniques, we obtained \u03fe97% pure population of CD11c \u03e9 Ly6G \u03ea cells that were F4/80 \u03e9 , as determined by FACS, and \u03fe90% pure population of F4/80 \u03e9 CD11c \u03ea Ly6G \u03ea double-negative (DN) cells (presumably inflammatory monocytes) from LHs of PCN-or PBSdosed but not infected mice ( Figure 5B ). Next, we investigated which of these cell subsets were better in killing MRSA. As expected, PCN-CD11c \u03e9 cells were more efficient than DN cells in killing bacteria in vitro (killing efficacy of CD11c \u03e9 cells, approximately 80%; DN cells, approximately 35%; Figure 5B ). Interestingly, no difference in bacterial killing was observed between CD11c \u03e9 and DN cells isolated from not infected PBS-dosed mice, and either of these cells killed only approximately 30% of bacteria. In the following experiment, we isolated Ly6G \u03e9 and Ly6G \u03ea cells from the lungs of PCN-or PBS-dosed mice that, 2.5 hours earlier, were infected with erythromycin-sensitive MRSA. Similarly, when lung Ly6G \u03e9 neutrophils and Ly6G \u03ea cells isolated from erythromycin-MRSAinfected PCN-or PBS-dosed mice were examined for their ability to kill WT MRSA, both of these cell subsets from PCN-dosed mice were more effective in killing bacteria than the respective cell subsets from PBS-dosed mice ( Figure  5C ). Moreover, Ly6G \u03ea cells were better in killing MRSA than Ly6G \u03e9 cells in both experimental groups. Within 1 hour after nasal installation, the PCN was found in respiratory lymph nodes (tracheobronchial and cervical) and, in 24 hours, they were nearly completely gone from the body. 17 To determine whether PCN-mediated protection from MRSA infection was limited to the lung environment, we isolated BM cells from mice that had been dosed with PCN or PBS a week earlier. The BM cells were then incubated with MRSA to determine the efficiency of uptake and killing of bacteria in vitro. After 30 minutes of incubation, BM cells from PCN-dosed mice took up twofold more bacteria than BM cells from PBSdosed mice ( Figure 5D ). The rate of internalization was highest when bacteria were opsonized with NMS, although even unopsonized bacteria and bacteria opsonized with heat-inactivated NMS were also internalized and killed by BM cells from PCN-dosed mice ( Figure 5 , D and E). When compared with the background MRSA levels (bacteria incubated alone and treated with gentamicin), similar numbers of bacteria were retrieved from wells incubated with BM cells from PBS-dosed mice, indicating that, during the 30 minutes of incubation time, BM cells from PBS-dosed mice failed to efficiently take up MRSA ( Figure 5D ). Interestingly, after 3 hours of incubation, BM cells from PBS-dosed mice killed MRSA, although not as well as BM cells derived from PCN-dosed mice ( Figure 5E ). During the 3 hours of in vitro incubation, BM cells from PCN-dosed mice killed, on average, two to three times more bacteria than these cells from PBSdosed mice, and killing of MRSA by BM cells from PCNdosed mice was enhanced, although not fully dependent, on opsonization by complement ( Figure 5E ).

In mice dosed with PCN, depletion of either neutrophils or CD11c \u03e9 cells impaired resistance to infection, because the bacterial burdens in the lungs of depleted mice were significantly greater than the burdens in the lungs of PCN-dosed mice treated with isotype control Abs ( Figure 6C, P \u03fd 0.05) . Moreover, in PCNdosed mice, neutrophil depletion resulted in much higher bacterial numbers than did CD11c \u03e9 cell depletion (P \u03fd 0.05), indicating the importance of neutrophil function in PCN-induced protection. Depletion of CD11c \u03e9 cells from PBS-dosed mice did not affect the lung CFU counts when compared with nondepleted PBS-dosed mice. However, the lungs of PBS-dosed mice depleted of neutrophils showed increases in CFUs when compared with PBSdosed mice not depleted of neutrophils (P \u03fd 0.001), indicating the importance of neutrophils in controlling MRSA, even in the absence of PCN. More important, regardless of whether the groups of mice were undepleted, depleted of neutrophils, or depleted of CD11c \u03e9 cells, the PCN-dosed mice were always more resistant to MRSA pneumonia than the PBS-dosed mice.",

Whether the protective CD11c \u03e9 cells were recruited monocytes resulting from PCN treatment, PCN-altered resident macrophages, or PCN-altered recruited monocytes remained to be determined. CCR2 is a receptor molecule for MCP-1. 52 Consequently, monocytes in CCR2 KO mice are impaired in their ability to infiltrate inflammatory sites and, thus, recruitment of monocytes in response to PCN treatment before MRSA infection should also be compromised. Indeed, numbers of CD11c \u03e9 cells were significantly reduced in PCNdosed CCR2 KO mice both before and 24 hours after MRSA infection when compared with PCN-dosed WT mice ( Figure 6D) . Also, PCN-dosed CCR2 KO mice were less competent than the PCN-dosed WT mice in clearing MRSA infection ( Figure 6D ). In this regard, at 24 hours after infection, PCN-dosed CCR2 KO mice showed \u03fe10fold more bacteria in their lungs than PCN-dosed WT mice, indicating that CCR2 signaling played a role in PCN-induced resistance to MRSA. Interestingly, when compared with PBS-dosed WT mice, PBS-dosed CCR2 KO mice showed elevated bacterial burden, but reduced CD11c \u03e9 cell numbers, at 24 hours after infection, implicating the role of recruited monocytes in clearance of MRSA infection in these mice as well. All CCR2 KO mice, independent of treatment, survived MRSA infection up to 96 hours, when the study was terminated (see Supplemental Figure S5A at http://ajp.amjpathol.org) .

The number of Vybrant \u03e9 cells in LHs of PCN-dosed mice 5 hours after MRSA infection was significantly higher when compared with the lungs of PBS-dosed mice ( Figure 6E , P \u03fd 0.01), indicating that PCN changed the lung environment, resulting in enhanced neutrophil recruitment in response to infection. Consistent with this observation were the findings of both a significant decrease of neutrophil recruitment in PCN-dosed CXCR2 KO mice ( Figure 6F , P \u03fd 0.001) and lower effectiveness in clearing MRSA infection (P \u03fd 0.05) compared with PCN-dosed WT mice. Moreover, the inability of PCN-dosed CXCR2 KO mice to recruit neutrophils to MRSA-infected lungs decreased their survival compared with PCN-dosed WT mice. In this regard, the PCN-dosed KO mice started dying by day 4 after infection; and by 5 days after infection, \u03fe80% of PCN-dosed CXCR2 KO mice had succumbed to MRSA infection, whereas all of the PCN-treated WT mice survived through 5 days (see Supplemental Figure S5B at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). More important, when compared with PCN-dosed CXCR2 KO mice, PBS-dosed CXCR2 KO mice were less effective in clearing MRSA infection, despite the CXCR2-independent recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs of PBS-dosed CXCR2 KO mice, but PCN-and PBS-dosed KO mice showed a similar lethality rate. This suggested that CXCR2 signaling was important for PCN-induced protection against lethality from MRSA infection, but not important for the PCN-independent resistance to MRSA pneumonia.",

To determine whether anti-inflammatory cytokines played an important role in PCN-mediated protection against MRSA, we analyzed bacterial burden in the lungs of PBS-or PCN-dosed IL-13 and IL-4 KO mice 24 hours after infection. Interestingly, no difference in bacterial clearance from the lungs was observed between PCN-and PBS-dosed IL-13 KO and PBS-dosed WT mice, but when those three groups of mice were compared with PCN-dosed WT mice, the three groups of mice each had at least 100-fold more bacteria in their lungs ( Figure 7A ).

PCN-dosed IL-4 KO mice cleared bacteria more effi-ciently than PCN-dosed IL-13 KO mice, but not nearly as well as PCN-dosed WT mice (data not shown). We also found that CD11c \u03e9 cells in PCN-dosed mice produced IL-13 at 2.5 hours after MRSA infection ( Figure 7B ). This observation was further confirmed by the virtual absence of IL-13 in BALFs of PCN-dosed WT mice that, before infection, were depleted of CD11c \u03e9 cells, much like PBSdosed mice independent of the presence of CD11c \u03e9 cells ( Figure 7C ).

Remarkably, when mice were treated with a VLP unrelated to PCN, P22, a similar degree of protection and recovery was observed. This suggests that the protective effect induced by either of the VLPs can be attributed to shared physical characteristics, such as repeating protein subunits, and small size, similar to a virus, rather than the origin of the VLP. VLPs, because of their ability to stimulate pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition receptors on DCs, are effective inducers of innate, and adaptive, immunity. 18 -20,53 Thus, VLPs have been used predominantly for their adjuvant properties 19, 21 and their ability to deliver either genetically conjugated or chemically fused epitopes for the induction of specific immune responses. 25, 54 However, their potential role as self-proprietors of immune modulation has not been extensively investigated, and the present data suggest that they could be used in this regard.",

At 6 hours after infection, lung bacterial burden was similar in PCN-and PBS-dosed mice; thus, in PCNdosed mice, the host response to MRSA caused less lung damage, which is similar to what we found in PCNdosed mice infected with influenza. 14 The more efficient bacterial clearance and abridged lung damage coincided with the greatly reduced lung tissue pathological characteristics, apparent by the lack of congestion and interstitial edema at 20 hours after MRSA infection in the lungs of PCN-dosed, but not PBS-dosed, mice.",

In this regard, it is plausible that PCN-induced CD11c \u03e9 DCs, although not numerous in the BALF, are important for protection from MRSA pneumonia.",

In this regard, Mtb was shown to avoid killing by macrophages via induction of cell necrosis rather than apoptosis. 56 Also, MRSA-induced programmed necrosis rapidly killed neutrophils, but not bacteria. 57 In our experiments, as early as 2 to 3 hours after MRSA infection, mononuclear cells isolated from PCN-dosed mice were intact and associated with bacteria. At the same time after infection, the plasma membrane of macrophages from PBS-dosed mice was already destroyed, and the remaining cell debris showed signs of organelle swelling, all of which is usually associated with necrosis. Furthermore, in contrast to PCNdosed mice, extracellular portions of the BALF of PBSdosed mice contained numerous bacteria, suggesting inefficient killing by cells in PBS-dosed mice. These results implicate that lung macrophages in PCN-dosed mice were resistant to MRSA-induced necrosis and, thus, were better able to kill MRSA.",

In this regard, PCN-dosed SCID mice showed similar recovery rates and nearly identical reduction of bacterial burden as PCN-dosed WT mice, and depletion of CD4 or CD8 T cells even further enhanced PCN-mediated protection (data not shown). Moreover, when depleted of either neutrophils or CD11c \u03e9 cells, PCN-dosed mice were less resistant to MRSA pneumonia. However, depletion of neutrophils after PCN administration resulted in the loss of more than two logs of protection and increased mortality of mice, whereas CD11c depletion resulted in the loss of less than a log of protection and had no effect on mouse survival. There is an obvious inconsistency between how efficient CD11c cells from PCN-dosed mice were in killing MRSA in vitro and only a moderate effect that the depletion of these cells had on bacterial burden in PCN-dosed mice in vivo. This discrepancy could be attributed to the overall fewer macrophages in the lungs when compared with neutrophils in PCN-dosed mice. Therefore, although CD11c \u03e9 cells appear more efficient in killing MRSA in vitro, neutrophils may have a greater in vivo effect because of their prevalence in the MRSAinfected lung.",

At 24 hours after MRSA infection, the bacterial burden of CCR2-deficient PCN-dosed mice was significantly elevated when compared with PCN-dosed WT mice, which is consistent with the well-established importance of recruited monocytes in fighting pulmonary microbial infections. 7,52,58 Therefore, we concluded that many CD11c \u03e9 cells in the lungs of PCN-dosed mice at infection are newly recruited resident cells. Despite sharing a similar FACS profile with CD11c \u03e9 cells in PBS-dosed mice, these cells were recruited to the lung in response to PCN administration; thus, they represent a diverse cell population, perhaps one that is more efficient in fighting bacterial infection.",

However, PCN-dosed CXCR2 KO mice infected with MRSA showed increased bacterial burden at 24 hours after infection, increased mortality, and a deficiency of neutrophil recruitment when compared with PCN-dosed WT mice. In contrast, CXCR2 KO mice that received PBS had nearly identical numbers of neutrophils as PBS-dosed WT mice. This suggests that, in contrast to PBS-dosed mice, MRSA-induced recruitment of neutrophils in PCN-dosed mice was CXCR2 dependent. Because no difference in bacterial burden was observed between PBS-dosed CXCR2 KO and WT mice at 24 hours after infection, we concluded, in agreement with other studies, 57,61 that neutrophils alone are not sufficient in clearing MRSA infection.",

In contrast to these mice, most macrophages in MRSA-infected, PBS-dosed mice showed characteristics of M2 cells. It is well described that M1 macrophages are more efficient responders to an acute infection, whereas the long-term stage M2 cells, even though they cause less tissue damage, are also less efficient in killing microbes. 62 Furthermore, M2 macrophages can be subdivided into three subclasses (a to c), in which M2a cells develop in the presence of IL-13/IL-4 and lipopolysaccharide enhances the M2b phenotype. 63 M2a AMs supported M1 cells and promoted lung defense against Pneumocystis murina. 64 Interestingly, induction of IL-13 and IL-4 was observed early after MRSA infection of PCN-dosed, but not PBS-dosed, mice, suggesting that M2 cells in PCN-and PBS-dosed mice can differ in their ability to support M1 cells in response to MRSA infection. Despite the presence of IL-13 in the BALF of MRSA-infected PCN-dosed, but not PBS-dosed, mice, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines remained similar between these mice until 12 hours after infection. After 12 hours of infection and likely as a consequence of disease resolution in PCN-dosed mice, a sudden reduc-tion of proinflammatory cytokines occurred in these mice. The importance of IL-13 in PCN-mediated protection from lethal MRSA pneumonia was indicated by the lack of recovery and disease resolution in PCN-dosed IL-13 KO mice, the increased mortality of these mice, and the realization of only partial protection in PCN-dosed IL-4 KO mice (data not shown). IL-13 causes neutrophil activation and recruitment via induction of IL-8 -like chemoattractant on airway epithelium. 65, 66 The role of IL-13 in pulmonary clearance of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus was reported by Olszewski et al. 67 In their hands, IL-13 KO mice showed delayed clearance of bacteria, but when mice were reconstituted with exogenous IL-13, normal clearance was restored. We have determined that CD11c \u03e9 cells in PCN-dosed, but not in PBS-dosed, mice are accountable for the production of IL-13, whereas the production of IL-4 was only partially dependent on the presence of CD11c \u03e9 cells. Which subsets of PCN-induced CD11c \u03e9 cells are involved in IL-13 and/or IL-4 production, and the exact mechanism of IL-13-dependent protection in our model, requires further investigation.",

A: The live cells gate is set on FCS (forward scatter; representing cell volume) versus SSC (side scatter; representing the inner complexity of the particle like granularity of a cell). Staining for CD11c versus CD11b is determined by gating total live cells. Representative FACS plots are shown.
