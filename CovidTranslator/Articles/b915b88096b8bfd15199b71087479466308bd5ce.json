            "text": "Many of the proteins produced by SARS-CoV-2 have related counterparts across the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) family. One such protein is non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9), which is thought to mediate both viral replication and virulence. Current understanding suggests that Nsp9 is involved in viral genomic RNA reproduction. Nsp9 is thought to bind RNA via a fold that is unique to this class of betacoronoaviruses although the molecular basis for this remains ill-defined. We sought to better characterise the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 protein and subsequently solved its X-ray crystal structure, in an apo-form and, unexpectedly, in a peptide-bound form with a sequence originating from a rhinoviral 3C protease sequence (LEVL). The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 revealed the high level of structural conservation within the Nsp9 family. The exogenous peptide binding site is close to the dimer interface and impacted on the relative juxtaposition of the monomers within the homodimer. Together we have established a protocol for the production of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9, determined its structure and identified a peptide-binding site that may warrant further study from the perspective of understanding Nsp9 function.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is comprised of a large single stranded positive polarity RNA genome that acts as messenger RNA after entering the host. Post infection, the ssRNA encodes two open reading frames, produced through host ribosomal frameshifting that transcribes two polyprotein products. The polyprotein products are subsequently cleaved into 27 viral proteins by internally encoded proteases. Further processing of the polyprotein releases an RNA-polymerase along with several non-structural proteins that facilitate RNA synthesis and may play a role in the enveloping process but are not included in the viral coat. Treatment of infections caused by betacoronoaviruses have focused on three therapeutic strategies; vaccination with the spike glycoprotein of the SARS-Cov-2 envelope (Wrapp et al., 2020) , and small-molecule targeting of conserved viral enzymes (e.g. the Mpro protease (Zhenming et al. 2020 ) (Yang et al., 2005) and the RNApolymerase (Yan et al. 2020) . Nevertheless, some of the betacoronaviral non-structural proteins appear important for viral replication within SARS-CoV and influence pathogenesis (Frieman et al., 2012) . Despite their close homology between viruses, such non-structural proteins remain of interest as they may have conserved roles within the viral lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2.",

Homologs of the Nsp9 protein have been identified in numerous coronaviruses including SARS-Cov-2 (Nsp9COV19), human coronavirus 229E (Nsp9HcoV), avian infectious bronchitis virus (Nsp9IBV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (Nsp9PEDV) and porcine delta virus (Nsp9PDCoV). Nsp9SARS has been shown to have modest affinity for long oligonucleotides with binding thought to be dependent on oligomerisation state (Egloff et al., 2004) (Sutton et al., 2004) . Nsp9SARS dimerises in solution via a conserved a-helical 'GxxxG' motif. Disruption of key residues within this motif reduces both RNA-binding (Sutton et al., 2004) and SARS-CoV viral proliferation (Frieman et al., 2012) . The mechanism of RNA binding within the Nsp9 protein family is not understood as these proteins have an unusual structural fold not previously seen in RNA binding proteins (Egloff et al., 2004) (Sutton et al., 2004) . The fold's Greek-key motif exhibits topological similarities with OB-fold proteins and small protein B but such vestiges have proven insufficient to provide clear insight into Nsp9 function (Egloff et al., 2004) . As a consequence of the weak affinity of Nsp9SARS for long oligonucleotide stretches it was suggested that the natural RNA substrate may instead be conserved features at the 3' end of the viral-genome (the stem-loop II RNA-motif) (Ponnusamy et al., 2008) . Furthermore, potential direct interactions with the co-factors of the RNA polymerase have been reported . However, it remains to be determined how the oligonucleotide-binding activity of Nsp9 proteins promote viral replication during infection.",

Nsp9COV19 exhibits 97% sequence identity with Nsp9SARS but only 44% sequence identity with Nsp9HCoV. The structure of the HCoV-229E Nsp9 protein suggested a potential oligomeric switch induced upon the formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond. Here, disulfide bond formation shifts the relative orientation of the Nsp9 monomers, which was suggested to promote higher-order oligomerisation (Ponnusamy et al., 2008) . The resultant rod-like higher order Nsp9HCoV assemblies had increased affinity for the RNA oligonucleotides. Cysteine mutants of Nsp9HCoV that are unable to produce the disulfide displayed reduced RNA-binding affinity (Ponnusamy et al., 2008) . The observation of a redox-induced structural switch of Nsp9HCoV led to the hypothesis that Nsp9HCoV may have a functional role in sensing the redox status of the host cell (Ponnusamy et al., 2008) . While the \"redox-switch\" cysteine responsible for oligomer formation in Nsp9HCoV is conserved amongst different viral Nsp9 homologues the higher-order oligomers were not observed for Nsp9SARS (Ponnusamy et al., 2008) . Because of these potential differences between Nsp9 proteins we sought to further characterise the nature of Nsp9COV19.",

The main component of the intersubunit interaction is the self-association of the conserved GxxxG protein-protein binding motif (Fig. 3C ) that allowed backbone van der Waals interactions between interfacing copies of the C-terminal \u03b11-helix (Hu et al. 2017) . Here Gly-100 of the respective parallel \u03b11-helices, formed complementary backbone van der Waals interactions. These interactions were replicated after a full helical turn by Gly-104 of the respective chains, thereby forming the molecular basis of the Nsp9COVID19 dimer interface (Fig. 3C) . The 2-fold axis that created the dimer ran at a ~15 \u00b0 angle through the GxxxG motif allowing the 14-residue helix to cross its counterpart (Fig.   4A ), the N-terminal turns of the helix were relatively isolated, only making contacts with counterpart protomer residues. In contrast, the Cterminal portions were encircled by hydrophobic residues, albeit at a distance that created funnel-like hydrophobic cavities either side of the interfacing helices (Fig. 3A) . Strands \u03b21, \u03b26 and the protein's C-terminus served to provide a ring of residues that encircled the paired helices. The first 10 residues of Nsp9COV19 exchanged across the dimer-interface to form a strand-like extension of \u03b21 that ran alongside \u03b26 from the other protomer (Fig. 3A) . The interaction these strands made did not appear optimal, indeed the remaining four C-terminal residues projected sideways across the dimer interface, inserting between the two strands while contributing a hydrophobic backing to the main helix.",

The 3C sequence folded-around either side of the paired intersubunit helices to fill two funnel-like hydrophobic cavities (Fig. 2D, 3B, 4C, D) . Namely, 3C residues LEVL, inserted into the opposing cavities either side of the dimer interface and ran parallel to the paired GxxxG motif. Moreover, the 3C sequence formed additional \u03b2-sheet interactions with the Nterminus of the protein from the other protomer (Fig. 3B) . To accommodate the 3C residues the N-terminal strand residues moved outward by ~1.6 \u00c5 (residues 6-10). This movement allowed the Nterminus to increase the number of \u03b2-sheet interactions it formed with \u03b26'. The \u03b2-barrel core of the fold remained unchanged but the increase in interactions between \u03b21 and \u03b26' served to exclude the C-terminus, prompting residues 106-111 to condense into a bent extension of the ahelix (Fig. 4A, B) . The subtle structural changes near the interacting GxxxG motifs (Fig. 3D ) are amplified at the periphery of the dimer resulting in ~ 6 \u00c5 shift in the \u03b2-barrel core (Fig. 4C) ",

This a-helical interface is encircled by hydrophobic residues but the interface includes considerable cavities as observed previously (Egloff et al., 2004) . We made a serendipitous discovery in our 3C-Nsp9COV19 structure, whereby the hydrophobic cavity captured the 3C cleavage sequence LEVL. The extraneous residues were tightly bound on all sides within the site situating themselves proximal to the conserved GxxxG motif. Coordination of the 3C sequence induced changes within interfacing residues, serving to both restructure key structural elements and cause a modest shift in subunit orientation.",

In the first instance this would seem unlikely, however our sequence is that of a rhinoviral 3C protease site and the SARS-CoV main protease cleaves consensus sequences following an LQ sequence (Zhu et al., 2011) .

Notably the M pro cleavage sequence occurs at multiple points throughout the CoV genome as the majority of viral proteins are released by its activity, thus it remains possible that Nsp9 may associate with unprocessed viral polyproteins retaining them near the viral RNA. Within our structure Met-101 provides contacts with the bound valine sidechain but the presence of Asn-33 nearby may also accommodate residues such as lysine at this position. Peptide-binding assays will need to be developed to rigorously assess such possibilities.",
