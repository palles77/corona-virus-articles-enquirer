Three in vitro virusneutralizing and in vivo protective mAbs against either continuous or discontinuous epitopes on the S glycoprotein were used to screen twelve different peptide libraries expressed on the pVIII major coat protein of the fd filamentous bacteriophage. Consensus sequences were identified that matched short sequences within the S glycoprotein. The sequence of a tight-binding, mAbselected peptide suggested the location of a discontinuous epitope within the N-terminal S1 subunit. Several tightly-binding phage were amplified and used directly as immunogens in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Partial protection of C57BL/6 mice against a lethal acute virus infection was achieved with a phage preparation that displayed a linear epitope. Protection correlated with the presence of sufficient levels of specific antiviral antibodies recognizing the same immunodominant domain and 13-mer peptide, located within the C-terminal S2 subunit, as the selecting mAb. Thus, the direct use of phage-displayed peptides to evaluate protective antiviral immune responses complements their use to characterize antibody-binding epitopes. This is the first evaluation of protective immunization induced by mAb-selected phage-displayed peptides.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses of the Coronaviridae family (Holmes and Lai, 1996) . Among the identified viral structural proteins, the surface (S) glycoprotein forms spike projections from the surface of the virion, and is involved in binding to cellular receptors and in membrane fusion (Collins et al., 1982; Sturman et al., 1985; Williams et al., 1991) . It is also the target of humoral and cellular immune responses (Collins et al., 1982; Stohlman et al., 1995; Williamson and Stohlman, 1990) . Moreover, various reports have emphasized the protective capacity of anti-S glycoprotein antibodies (Buchmeier et al., 1984; Nakanaga et al., 1986) . A proteolytic cleavage site divides the S glycoprotein into two subunits, the N-terminal S1 and the C-terminal S2 (Spaan et al., 1988; Sturman et al., 1985) . It is believed that S1 forms the bulbous part of the spike and S2 the stalk portion (De Groot et al., 1987) . It has also been shown that the N-terminal region of the S1 subunit is involved in binding to the cellular receptor (Kubo et al., 1994) . Murine coronaviruses, also called mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV), induce various respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological infections in rodents. The neurotropic strains A59 and JHM lead to infections of the central nervous system that result in an acute lethal encephalitis (Cheever et al., 1949; Weiner, 1973) . Mice who survive the acute infection develop a chronic demyelinating disease resembling human multiple sclerosis (Siddell et al., 1983) .",

MAbs 7-10A, 5B19 and 5B170 were selected for the present study since they neutralize virus infectivity in vitro and passively protect BALB/c mice against lethal infection in vivo (Buchmeier et al., 1984; Daniel and Talbot, 1990 ). MAb 7-10A was predicted to recognize a discontinuous epitope on the S1 subunit since it did not bind to the denatured S glycoprotein in Western immunoblots (Daniel and Talbot, 1990 ) and did bind to purified, native S1 subunit (P.J. Talbot and K.V. Holmes, unpublished data) . In contrast, mAbs 5B19 and 5B170 recognize linear epitopes within an immunodominant region of the S2 subunit (Daniel et al., 1993) ; critical binding residues have been identified for mAb 5B19 (Luytjes et al., 1989) . A previous study using papain-and pepsin-derived fragments or recombinant single chain Fv molecules derived from mAb 7-10A showed that the Fc portion of this antibody is not required for neutralization of MHV-A59 in vitro and in vivo (Lamarre and Talbot, 1995; Lamarre et al., 1997) ; this mAb can also induce protective anti-idiotypic antibodies (Yu et al., 1996) .",

Analysis of the amino-acid sequences of the selected phage allowed the identification of consensus sequences for peptides recognized by the antiviral mAbs 5B19 and 5B170, which recognize continuous epitopes ( Table 2 ). The critical binding sequence for each of these two mAbs was very similar since phage selected by both mAbs cross-reacted: phage selected by mAb 5B170 were recognized strongly by mAb 5B19, and vice-versa, albeit at a lower level, whereas no phage reacted with the isotypic control mAb (Figure 1 ). For mAb 7-10A, which recognizes a discontinuous epitope (Daniel and Talbot, 1990) , consensus amino acid sequences were more difficult to identify; this is typical of antibodies against discontinuous epitopes (e.g., see Felici et al., 1993; Luzzago et al., 1993) . Figure 2 illustrates the amino-acid identities between selected phage-displayed peptides and murine coronavirus S glycoprotein sequences. In contrast with other studies (Balass et al., 1993; Felici et al., 1993; Luzzago et al., 1993) , amino-acid identity was obtained for phage 12.9, selected by mAb 7-10A, and a linear region of the S glycoprotein of several coronavirus strains. The 7-10A mAb recognizes a discontinuous epitope on S1, as shown by binding studies on isolated S glycoprotein subunits (P.J. Talbot and K.V. Holmes, unpublished data) . Clone 12.9 contains two cysteines and bears similarities to residues 153-161 of the S glycoprotein of murine hepatitis virus (MHV). This clone represents the first sequence information obtained on the epitope recognized by mAb 7-10A.",

This result is consistent with previous epitope mapping by ELISA (Daniel et al., 1993) showing that mAbs 5B170 and 5B19 compete with each other for binding to virus. The sequences of the binding region for both antibodies are identical in MHV-JHM and A59, suggesting that the epitopes recognized by mAbs 5B19 and 5B170 are conserved on the S2 subunit of MHV.

The results shown in Figure 3 indicate that disulfide bridging within the phage-displayed peptides was more important for recognition by mAb 7-10A than for mAbs 5B19 and 5B170, since the binding of mAb 7-10A with peptides was more affected by DTT. As a control, immobilized virus was also treated with DTT; the binding of mAb 7-10A to virus was not affected (Figure 3 , panel B). However, the binding of mAbs 5B19 and 5B170 with the virus was unexpectedly more affected when the virus was treated with DTT. The results suggest that the two cysteines observed in the peptides recognized by mAbs 5B19 and 5B170 may directly interact with the mAb binding site, or that disulfide constraints are important but not absolutely required for binding. The alignment analysis shown in Figure 2 (panel c), in which two cysteines form a portion of the epitope, is supported by the fact that several of the clones selected by mAb 5B170 came from the X8CX8 library, in which only one Cys residue is fixed. The second, C-terminal Cys residue in the sequence was selected by mAb from a fully-randomized residue.",

Having identified peptides that are recognized by three in vitro neutralizing and in vivo protective mAbs, we examined whether these peptides, displayed on the phage surface, could be used directly as immunogens for the induction of neutralizing and protective antibodies in mice. Selected phage showing relatively strong ELISA signals were injected into both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice; it has been shown that C57BL/10 mice respond better than BALB/c mice for induction of specific anti-peptide antibodies, using the phage itself as a carrier molecule (de la Cruz et al., 1988) . Four i.p. injections were given, followed by viral challenge 10 days after the last injection. The survival of mice was then evaluated. As shown in Figure 4 , of all the different phage selected by the three mAbs, only the mAb 5B170-selected clone 9.1 induced a statistically significant protective immune response against a lethal coronavirus infection. Three of six C57BL/6 mice were protected whereas no BALB/c mice immunized with the same phage 9.1 survived the viral challenge. Mice immunized with control vector phage or other selected phage died between days 4 and 9 after the viral challenge, a normal outcome of acute viral encephalitis.

We initially used synthetic peptide hexamers corresponding to consensus sequences observed on phages that reacted more strongly with virus-specific mAbs ( Table 2) : CIGSQC (phage clones 9. 1, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.9 selected with mAb 5B170 and phage clones 33.2, 33.4, 33.5, 33.6 and 33.9 selected with mAb 5B19) and CIGSYC (phage clones 7.2, 7.4, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8 selected with mAb 5B170). All peptides were tested with plasma of immunized mice and the corresponding mAbs in both linear and conformationally-constrained cyclic forms. However, using various amounts of peptides and different buffers, we could barely demonstrate reactivity with mAbs and did not observe reactions with plasma of immunized mice (data not shown). We concluded that the peptides were too short for binding to the plastic of the microtiter plates and instead used the 13-mer peptide A that we had previously identified and used in ELISA (Spaan et al., 1988) . This peptide bears a CIGSTC sequence that is very similar to both consensus sequences described above and is flanked on either side by three amino acid from the viral S protein sequence. As shown in Figure 6 , only mice immunized with phage clone 9.1 reacted specifically with peptide A and C57BL/6 mice produced higher titers of peptide-specific antibodies than BALB/c mice. Interestingly, reactivities were only seen with the linear peptide, suggesting that disulfide bridging is not involved in antibody binding, thereby adding strength to data obtained with DTT ( Figure 3 ), To evaluate possible mechanisms of protection mediated by specific antiviral antibodies, we evaluated the in vitro virus neutralization activity. As shown in Table 4 , no in vitro neutralization activity was detected at dilutions of plasma samples that could be tested, down to a dilution of 1/50. Moreover, antibody-dependent cell mediated cytolysis (ADCC) and antibody dependent complement-mediated cytolysis (ADCMC) activities were also evaluated, but such activities were not detected either (down to a dilution 1/50 for ADCC and 1/10 for ADCMC; data not shown). Positive control mAbs were used in all the in vitro assays (except for the ADCC assay because, to our knowledge, no positive mAb is available in the coronavirus system). For unknown reasons and despite numerous attempts in our laboratory, ADCC activities could not be demonstrated for various anti-MHV mAbs (data not shown).",

All three mAbs selected binding phage from libraries encoding one or two fixed cysteine residues, but not from the unconstrained peptide libraries. Many of the sequences of the mAb-selected phage bore similarity with linear regions on the S glycoprotein of several murine coronaviruses.

In spite of the lack of an obvious consensus sequence among the clones selected with mAb 7-10A (Table 2) , clone 12.9, which reacted relatively strongly in ELISA, shares five to six homologous amino acids with a linear region between amino acids 153 to 161 of the S1 subunit of the S glycoprotein ( Figure 2 ). This N-terminal, globular domain is involved in the binding of virus to cells (Kubo et al., 1994) ; however, for several reasons, the epitope recognized by mAb 7-10A is probably not directly involved in binding to the cellular receptor. First, we have previously shown that mAb 7-10A only weakly inhibits virus binding to the cell, whereas it strongly neutralizes viral infectivity after the virus binds to the cell (Y. Salvas, S. Lemieux and P.J. Talbot, unpublished data). In contrast, mAb 5B19, whose epitope is located on the C-terminal, stalk-like S2 subunit, is far more potent than mAb 7-10A in inhibiting viral binding to cells (Y. Salvas, S. Lemieux and P.J. Talbot, unpublished data). Second, clone 12.9 did not inhibit the attachment of MHV-A59 to DBT cells (data not shown), suggesting that the displayed peptide did not bind to the cellular receptor. Third, in a recent study (Saeki et al., 1997) , it was shown that amino-acid residues 62-65 on S1 are involved in binding to the cellular receptor; the mAb 7-10A epitope mimic displayed by clone 12.9 ( Figure 2 ) does not localize within this region.",

The binding of mAb 7-10A to several clones that did not bear the same peptide sequence as clone 12.9 indicates that further studies using, for example, synthetic peptides bearing amino-acid replacements in the sequence of the clone 12.9 peptide, are needed to pinpoint the exact nature of this epitope. Such studies will be important given the apparent importance of this epitope in the virus life cycle. Indeed, we have been unable to select viable mAb 7-10A-resistant virus variants (P.J.

Moreover, phage selected by either mAb were recognized by both mAbs, albeit with weaker binding for mAb 5B170 (Figure 1 ). This confirms that both mAbs recognize similar epitopes and that 5B19 has a stronger affinity than 5B170 for peptides selected by either antibody (Figure 1 ). The sequences of CDRs H1, H2 and H3 for the two mAbs bore little similarity and the mAbs derive from different VH families (Table 3) .

Of all the phage tested, only clone 9.1, selected by mAb 5B170, induced a statistically significant protective immune response in C57BL/6 mice (Figure 4 ), which correlated with the production of statistically significant levels of antiviral antibodies (Table 4 ), confirming that the S glycoprotein epitope mimicked by the phage-borne peptide is immunogenic in mice. Surprisingly, biological activities by which antibodies could mediate protection of C57BL/6 mice, such as neutralization, ADCC and ADCMC, were not detected. However, the presence of antibodies specific to the immunodominant region of the S2 subunit and to the relevant 13-mer peptide A correlated with the protection observed ( Figures 5 and 6 , respectively). These results suggest the important role of the specific humoral immune response in clone 9.1-induced protection.",

Indeed, a recent report suggests that a minimal antibody concentration in serum is necessary for in vivo protection against vesicular stomatitis virus infection, and that protection is independent of antibody subclass, avidity and in vitro neutralizing activity (Bachmann et al., 1997) . Furthermore, we have previously shown that BALB/c mice were protected against MHV infection by immunization with synthetic peptide A, which includes the epitope found by Luytjes et al. (1989) , when coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. In this case, the protected mice also developed virus-specific antibodies that did not neutralize the virus in vitro (Daniel et al., 1994) .",

This apparent discrepancy may be explained by differences between clones in the sequences flanking the consensus sequence. These flanking residues could alter the conformation of the presented peptide (Vijayakrishnan et al., 1997) , and in only some cases, allow it to select virus cross-reactive B-cell clones. Thus, by allowing the mAbs to select binding peptides from random-peptide libraries, we were able to identify flanking regions that could not have been anticipated a priori. This emphasizes the major contribution that random-peptide libraries can make in identifying immunogenic epitopes.",

(1991) , who showed that peptides expressed on the pVIII major coat protein are more immunogenic than those expressed on the pIII minor coat protein; presumably, this is due to the higher copy number of the displayed peptide. Moreover, it has also been shown that peptides displayed on phage induce a stronger immune response than a peptide coupled to another carrier molecule (de la Cruz et al., 1988; Lenstra et al., 1992; Meola et al., 1995) . However, other studies have demonstrated that phage-displayed peptides selected by mAbs are not necessarily immunogenic. For example, a study by Felici et al. (1993) reported that phage clones, selected for their ability to bind a mAb against the Bordetella pertussis toxin, failed to elicit a specific immune response against the toxin; whereas similar work by the same group on the human hepatitis B virus surface antigen (Meola et al., 1995) resulted in cross-reactive antibody production. Thus, the ability of an antibody-selected peptide mimic to elicit antibodies that will recognize a target antigen depends on a number of variables, including (i) its ability to mimic the structure of the epitope, (ii) its ability to bind specifically to the selecting antibody, and (iii) the structure and biological properties of the selecting antibody. Also, direct immunization of the selected peptide displayed by a phage could be optimized by combining T helper and B epitopes.",

The various peptides were synthesized with a homemade manual multireactor solid-phase synthesizer according to protocols described previously Forget et al., 1990) . A benzhydrylamine resin was used as solid support. The following side chain-protected Bocamino acids were used in the synthesis: 4-methylbenzyl-cysteine, benzyl-glutamic acid, benzyl ether-serine, and 2-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl-tyrosine. Boc-amino acid couplings were performed in dimethylformamide with BOP reagent (Fournier et al., 1988) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine Le-Nguyen et al., 1987) . Every coupling was monitored with the use of the ninhydrin test. Peptide-resins were cleaved from the solid support with liquid hydrofluoric acid (10 ml/g) in the presence of mcresol (1 ml/g) and dimethylsulfide (1 ml/g) as scavengers. Crude peptides were purified through preparative reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the material was eluted with a linear gradient of trifluoroacetic acid/H 2 O (0.06%) and acetonitrile. The fractions corresponding to the purified peptide were pooled and lyophilized. To cyclize the peptides, they were dissolved in degassed aqueous acetic acid (80%), and a solution of iodine (50 Eq) in methanol was added dropwise. The reaction was monitored with the use of analytical HPLC and it was stopped by the addition of ascorbic acid until complete discoloration. Most of the acetic acid was evaporated and the remaining solution was diluted with water. The solution was injected onto a preparative HPLC column, and the peptide was purified as described above. Each preparation was characterized through analytical HPLC and electrospray mass spectrometry. For determination of peptide-specific antibodies by ELISA, synthetic peptides were used as described previously (14), except that the optimal amount used was determined to be 5 \u03bcg/ml.",
