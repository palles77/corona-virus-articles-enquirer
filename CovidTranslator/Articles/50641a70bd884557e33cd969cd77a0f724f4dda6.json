Qualified nurses attending continuing professional education courses at a large London university between 18 April and 18 October 2010 were surveyed (522/672; response rate 77 . 7 %). Of these, 82 . 6% worked in hospitals ; 37 . 0 % reported receiving seasonal influenza vaccination in the previous season and 44 . 9% reported never being vaccinated during the last 5 years. All respondents were categorized using two-step cluster analyses into never, occasionally, and continuously vaccinated groups. Nurses vaccinated the season before had higher scores of knowledge and risk perception compared to the unvaccinated (P<0 . 001). Nurses never vaccinated had the lowest scores of knowledge and risk perception compared to other groups (P<0 . 001). Nurses' seasonal influenza vaccination behaviours are complex. Knowledge and risk perception predict uptake of vaccination in nurses.",

Healthcare workers (HCWs) can be a key source for influenza transmission in communities and hospitals as they are exposed to both infected patients and high-risk groups [2, 3] . Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection and severe outcomes [1] and the principal measure to reduce the impact of epidemics, such as hospitalization, mortality and morbidity [2, [3] [4] [5] . Moreover, studies suggest that the vaccination of HCWs has substantial economic benefits as well as health-related benefits, including reduced absenteeism from work and the extra costs of sick leave and staff replacement [4, 6, 7] .",

However, studies suggest that influenza vaccine uptake in HCWs is often low worldwide [11] [12] [13] [14] . For example, the overall seasonal vaccination rate in England for HCWs was 26 . 4% for the 2009/2010 season [15] .

Two clusters, the newly vaccinated and continuously vaccinated, were identified for the vaccinated group and another two clusters, never vaccinated and used to be vaccinated, were identified in the unvaccinated group.

This cluster had the lowest knowledge score, suggesting that increasing their knowledge might improve their vaccination behaviours. However, it seems there are 'persistent decliners ' who are in the 'habit ' of not having a vaccination. This suggests that future educational campaigns need to be persistent, durative, and intensive if their vaccination behaviours are to be modified. For those who had been vaccinated in the past but not in the current season, knowledge was also a predictor for their vaccination behaviours, which suggests that current vaccination campaigns have failed to address their misgivings about vaccination to maintain their compliance with the annual vaccination recommendation for HCWs. Between those occasionally vaccinated and continuously vaccinated, knowledge levels were not significantly different but the newly vaccinated in 2009 had on average higher knowledge scores than those continuously vaccinated. This may reflect an increase in their risk perceptions towards influenza due to widespread reporting of the risks in the media encouraging them to be vaccinated for the first time in their lives. This suggests that timing may be crucial to the success of vaccination campaigns making behaviour modification easier. Future studies are required to explore the relationship between the content and timings of vaccination campaigns and nurses' first vaccination uptake.",

But perceptions of the negative consequences of contracting influenza and severity of influenza were not major factors, a finding which is consistent with findings of previous studies [16] . This suggests that future educational campaigns might be more effective if they focus on the negative personal consequences of contracting influenza and its sequelae rather than nurses' professional duty to protect patients or other vulnerable groups. Additionally, the reasons which nurses gave for having vaccination focused upon their personal health motivation rather than a professional responsibility regardless of whether they were vaccinated or unvaccinated. Concerns about the vaccine's side-effects and effectiveness or safety were the two most frequent reasons for not having a vaccination indicating continuing misconceptions about influenza vaccine in nurses. Future educational campaigns may wish to consider providing targeted information to change these widespread myths in nurses. However, these concerns did not seem to influence vaccination decisions because both vaccinated as well as unvaccinated nurses noted these reasons against vaccination. It may be the case that 2 days of minor discomfort postvaccination is tolerable when set against a year's influenza protection. Unvaccinated nurses reported 'no need ' as their reason not having a vaccination which is consistent with their low-risk perception of contracting influenza. The convenience of the vaccination programme was identified as an organizational reason highlighting the importance of easy access to vaccination to increase its coverage in nurses.",
