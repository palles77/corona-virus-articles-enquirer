Other medical relevant viruses in this genus are yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus (Monath 1994 , Lindenbach et al. 2007 ). The flavivirus genome consists of a 5' m7 G-capped single-stranded positive RNA of approximately 11 Kb in length, containing a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by untranslated regions [5'-untranslated region (UTR) and 3'-UTR]. Release of virus RNA in susceptible cells leads to the translation of the ORF producing a polyprotein that is co-and posttranslationally processed to generate three structural (C, prM and E) and seven nonstructural (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b and NS5) proteins (Chambers et al. 1990 , Clyde et al. 2006 , Lindenbach et al. 2007 , Fernandez-Garcia et al. 2009 ).",

The flavivirus infectious clone methodology was first established for YFV (Rice et al. 1989 ) and since then it has provided valuable insights in genome replication (Alvarez et al. 2005) , virus pathogenesis (Liu et al. 2006) , vaccine development (Guy et al. 2008 ) and antiviral research (Puig-Basagoiti et al. 2005) . Infectious cDNA clones have been successfully developed for other flaviviruses (Yamshchikov et al. 2001 , Pu et al. 2011 ) and DENV (Lai et al. 1991 , Kapoor et al. 1995 , Puri et al. 2000 , Blaney Jr et al. 2004 ). An alternative approach developed to study flaviviruses involves the construction of subgenomic replicons derived from the corresponding parental infectious clone (Jones et al. 2005 , Alcaraz-Estrada et al. 2010 . Lacking one or more structural proteins, replicons are capable of autonomous replication in susceptible cells even though they are unable to produce virus particles (Khromykh & Westaway 1997 , Jones et al. 2005 , Widman et al. 2008 ). Yet, most of these systems are based on established strains or clinical isolates adapted to growth in cultured cells after several passages and only few studies have focused in low passage virus strains (Kurosu et al. 2010) , which are important assets in deciphering key elements in virus pathogenesis and virulence determinants (Ubol et al. 2008 , Tuiskunen et al. 2011 .",

            "text": "In an ideal reverse genetics system, cloned flavivirus genomes should be stably propagated. Unfortunately, instability of full-length cDNA clones in Escherichia coli remains a major hold back to development of these systems (Polo et al. 1997 , Ruggli & Rice 1999 genome sequence at the E/NS1 region or an expressed product from that region appears to be associated with this toxicity (Polo et al. 1997 , Blaney Jr et al. 2004 ), but others regions might be implicated as well (Pu et al. 2011) . Several approaches have been developed and evaluated to overcome genome instability of flavivirus infectious cDNA clones, including: the incorporation of a linker containing redundant termination codons in the genome (Blaney Jr et al. 2004) , the use of an in vitro ligation strategy derived from two plasmids (Kapoor et al. 1995) , the use of low-copy number vectors (Bredenbeek et al. 2003) or bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) (Suzuki et al. 2007) , the use of different E. coli strains (Sriburi et al. 2001) or the cloning in yeast cells (Polo et al. 1997) . More recently, investigators were able to surpass genome instability by introducing silent mutations in cryptic promoters in the viral genome to lower E. coli promoter activity (Pu et al. 2011) . In another strategy, DENV-3 genome was cloned as four segmented, sequential fragments and directionally in vitro ligated to create a full-length infectious clone. While novel to flaviviruses, this approach have been effectively used in coronavirus research (Messer et al. 2012) .",

Many strategies to stabilise flavivirus genome aim to reduce plasmid copy number in E. coli by using low-copy plasmid or BAC vectors. We sought a similar approach to lower plasmid copy number in yeast by using a chromosome-derived origin of replication. The pSVJS01 backbone is based on pBeloBAC11, a BAC vector. To create the new shuttle vector, a 2-kb fragment was amplified by PCR from pRS414 containing CEN6/ARS H1 and TRP1. A T7 promoter recognition site and a MCS were also engineered into this fragment. Plasmid pSVJS01 was assembled by inserting 2-kb fragment into NotI-linearised pBeloBAC11 vector by homologous recombination.

However, obtaining flavivirus infectious clones has not been an easy task. The single most reported hurdle in the establishment of these systems is an inherent instability of flavivirus genome in E. coli (Pu et al. 2011) . In this paper, the successful construction and characterisation of a complete reverse genetics system for DENV-3 has been described. This system was developed with a low passage DENV-3 clinical isolate. Infectious cDNA clone methodology has been developed for all four DENV serotypes and other major flaviviruses, but most systems utilised established strains or laboratoryadapted clinical isolates as parental virus. Even though the value of these studies is unquestionable, it is important to point out the need to expand this methodology for low passage clinical isolates to gain a complete picture in flavivirus biology, particularly in virus pathogenesis, virulence determinants and vector competence (Ubol et al. 2008 , Tuiskunen et al. 2011 , Cox et al. 2012 .",

            "text": "). TheDengue virulence and fitness are important factors that determine disease outcome. However, dengue virus (DENV) molecular biology and pathogenesis are not completely elucidated. New insights on those mechanisms have been facilitated by the development of reverse genetic systems in the past decades. Unfortunately, instability of flavivirus genomes cloned in Escherichia coli has been a major problem in these systems. Here, we describe the development of a complete reverse genetics system, based on the construction of an infectious clone and replicon for a low passage DENV-3 genotype III of a clinical isolate. Both constructs were assembled into a newly designed yeast-E. coli shuttle vector by homologous recombination technique and propagated in yeast to prevent any possible genome instability in E. coli. RNA transcripts derived from the infectious clone are infectious upon transfection into BHK-21 cells even after repeated passages of the plasmid in yeast. Transcript-derived DENV-3 exhibited growth kinetics, focus formation size comparable to original DENV-3 in mosquito C6/36 cell culture. In vitro characterisation of DENV-3 replicon confirmed its identity and ability to replicate transiently in BHK-21 cells. The reverse genetics system reported here is a valuable tool that will facilitate further molecular studies in DENV replication, virus attenuation and pathogenesis.",

            "text": "coli (Gibson 2009 , Shanks et al. 2009 ). We have also demonstrated the utility of pSVJS01 vector for stable propagation of DENV-3 genome in yeast. Several reverse genetics systems were established using low-copy plasmid or BAC vectors in an effort to lower plasmid copy number in E. coli and, as consequence, achieve stability of cloned genomes. In a previous attempt, we were only able to recovery a DENV-3 infectious clone by an in vitro ligation strategy using the pBSC shuttle vector (JJS Santos & LHVG Gil, unpublished observations) . Despite this vector has been successfully used to manipulate pestivirus genomes (Ansari et al. 2004 , Gil et al. 2006 , pBSC vector carries a 2 \u00b5m high copy number origin of replication. We hypothesised that reducing plasmid copy number in yeast using a chromosome-derived origin of replication would allow the successful assembly of a full-length DENV-3 infectious clone.In contrast with Pu et al. (2011) , no silent mutations were necessary to be introduced to circumvent sequence instability and recovery a functional infectious clone. RNA transcripts derived from DENV-3 infectious clone were infectious upon transfection into BHK-21 cells. Transcript-derived DENV-3 exhibited growth kinetics, focus formation and size comparable to WT-DENV-3 in mosquito C6/36 cell culture. Of paramount importance, RNA transcripts remained infectious even after repeated passages of the plasmid in yeast. The long-term stability of many infectious clones previously described remains largely undetermined after serial passages of the cloned genome in the harbouring host. Only few reports have more closely investigated this stability of continuing propagated flavivirus infectious clones (Hurrelbrink et al. 1999 , Bredenbeek et al. 2003 , Pu et al. 2011 ). Most of their assessment relies on virus rescue from or restriction pattern of passaged plasmid. Our work went one step further showing not only the ability of rescuing virus, but also that the nucleotide sequence of DENV-3 viral genome remain unchanged after successive passages of the plasmid in yeast.Different approaches have been used for the construction of flavivirus replicons. We used an approach previously described for a DENV-2 replicon by selectively removing almost the entire prM-E coding region (Pang et al. 2001 ). DENV-3 replicon was also easily assembled into pSVJS01 shuttle vector. In vitro characterisation of DENV-3 replicon confirmed its ability to replicate transiently in BHK-21 cells.In summary, we describe an alternative and effective strategy to bypass flavivirus genome instability commonly observed in E. coli by using homologous recombination in yeast and a newly designed pSVJS01 vector. This reverse genetics system will be a valuable tool for studying the molecular mechanisms involved in viral genome replication, virion assembly, virus pathogenesis and vaccine development. This approach can be applied to others DENV serotypes or flaviviruses.",
