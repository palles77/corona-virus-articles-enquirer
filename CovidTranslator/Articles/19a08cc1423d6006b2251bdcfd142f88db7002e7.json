Clinical characteristics reporting in China revealed that most patients are mild and moderate [3, 4] .

Firstly, low-quality data was filtered out as following: (1) cells expressed less than 10 genes; (2) genes expressed in less than two percent of cells. Secondly, we calculated log 2 (count-per-million + 1) expression, and followed by normalization and standardization. Thirdly, the cells were clustered. In detail, the highly variable genes were identified and cells were then clustered through embedding them into a graph structure in Principal Component Analysis space. The parameter resolution was set as 0.5 to identify only major cell types. The clustered cells were then projected onto a two-dimensional space and visualized. Finally, the differentially expressed genes on each cluster were identified. They were used to annotate and merge the cell clusters according to curated known cell markers (http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/CellMarker/index.jsp).",

As indicated in Figure 5B , TMPRSS2 was almost expressed in all kinds of cells. In our enrolled drugs, camostat mesylate act as a trypsin like protease inhibitor and could be potentially used to anti-virus by inhibiting TMPRSS2 activity. Due to the ubiquitous expression of its target, camostat mesylate could also cause potential toxicity when exerting therapeutic effect. On the other hand, ACE2 was mainly expressed in type I pneumocyte, type II pneumocyte, FOXN4 + , club and mast cells. chloroquine phosphate can change the ACE2 structure, or inhibit the binding of coronavirus S protein with ACE2.

Since nonsynonymous mutations and gene expression levels can both affect the DCTs efficacy and toxicity as mentioned above, optimized therapy strategies are needed to benefit these affected patients all over the world. In this study, we give three suggestions for DCTs as follows. Firstly, drugs in CPIC guideline including ribavirin, \u03b1 -interferon, chloroquine and captopril should be utilized with genetic detections as guided. In this situation, adequate gene detection kits should be prepared in Africa for COVID-19 therapy, as related genetic variation frequency is higher in AFRs than other countries. Secondly, drug such as chloroquine whose efficacy and toxicity can be determined by nonsynonymous mutations, may be preferred in special population with lower frequency of risk alleles such as Finnish and Non-Finnish European. Otherwise, alternative drug for chloroquine can be used in high risk populations. Thirdly, for drugs that can inhibit the activity of CYP450, DDI should be prevented in COVID-19",

Then related molecular biological studies can be conducted to validate these candidate pharmacogenes rapidly. Then the period of pharmacogenes identification can be shorted. The second challenge is that some serious nonsynonymous mutations can be hardly identified in current pharmacogenetics studies, due to the frequencies of many nonsynonymous mutations are lower than 1%. That's why the nonsynonymous mutations we presented above are common variants. If there are only a few patients carried a serious nonsynonymous mutation, related study can hardly be conducted to identify this mutation because of the limited sample size. However, as we indicated in Figure 3 , most of nonsynonymous mutations are rare variations. Therefore, a reliable way to predict potential pharmacogenetic variation is also important to improve the efficacy or avoid serious toxicity [23] . The third challenge is that a suitable strategy for precision medicine in COVID-19 treatment is still lack. A well-designed gene detection panel is important to fully characterized the patients' genotypes which relate to the drug effects [24] . Then the best treatment regimen can be utilized for this patient, and both of the efficacy and the safety can be guaranteed. In our study, feasible suggestions were given, and it still can be much improved with the development of some pharmacogenetic studies in the future.
