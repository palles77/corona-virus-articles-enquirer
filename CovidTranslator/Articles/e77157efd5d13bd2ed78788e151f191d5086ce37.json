In thirty-four samples, we detected adenovirus by IC Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest, which were subsequently multiplex PCR negative (false positives). These discrepancies may be explained at least in part by cross-reaction with other viruses (eleven cases the sample was positive for bocavirus, five influenza B-virus, four influenza A-virus, four enterovirus, three RSV-A, two rhinovirus, two metapneumovirus, one influenza C-virus and one parainfluenzavirus type 3). Thus, the IC Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest has moderately sensitivity and specificity compared with those of multiplex PCR and viral culture for detecting the Adenovirus. Samples with negative rapid assay results should have additional testing for adenovirus performed by either viral culture or PCR.
