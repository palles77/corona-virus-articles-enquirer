To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against TGEV infection, three plasmids (pRNAT-1, pRNAT-2, and pRNAT-3) expressing short hairpin RNAs were designed to target three different coding regions of the M gene of TGEV. The plasmids were constructed and transiently transfected into a porcine kidney cells, PK-15, to determine whether these constructs inhibited TGEV production. The analysis of cytopathic effects demonstrated that pRNAT-2 and pRNAT-3 could protect PK-15 cells against pathological changes specifically and efficiently. Additionally, indirect immunofluorescence and 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) assays showed that pRNAT-2 and pRNAT-3 inhibited the multiplication of the virus at the protein level effectively. Quantitative real-time PCR further confirmed that the amounts of viral RNAs in cell cultures pre-transfected with the three plasmids were reduced by 13, 68, and 70%, respectively. This is the first report showing that RNAi targeting of the M gene. Our results could promote studies of the specific function of viral genes associated with TGEV infection and might provide a theoretical basis for potential therapeutic applications.",

Pigs of any age and breed can be infected. In particular, sucking piglets at about 2 weeks old are the most susceptible, showing mortality rates up to 100%, which results in large economic loss in swine-producing areas worldwide [2, 3] . However, the pathogenic mechanism of TGEV remains unclear [4] . At present, several vaccines to prevent TGE are available; however, their efficacies are variable. Attenuated TGEV vaccines have the risk of returning to the virulent form and might even induce an adverse reaction and inactivated viruses are not sufficiently protective in pigs [5, 6] . Moreover, newborn piglets can suffer from gastroenteritis within 20 h post-infection, and death can occur in 1-4 days [7] , whereas current vaccines cannot provide complete protection in the first 7 days after inoculation. Thus, it is necessary to develop novel, highly effective, and rapid-acting antivirals to resist TGEV infection [8] .",

The S protein is a major membrane glycoprotein that plays important roles in inducing a protective immune response, and in virus attachment, membrane fusion, and viral pathogenicity [20] [21] [22] . The N protein, together with the genomic RNA, forms the viral nucleocapsid [22] . The E protein regulates virion assembly and release [23] . The M protein is the most abundant component of the coronavirus particle [24] and differs from other viral proteins in terms of its structure, processing, and intracellular transport [25] . The expressions of the M and E proteins might be sufficient to trigger the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs). In addition, M is highly conserved among different strains, and our previous studies proved that the expression the M protein alone using a baculovirus expression system could lead to the formation of VLPs, as observed under a transmission electron microscope, which further confirmed that the M protein of TGEV is a decisive protein for the proliferation of viral proteins [26] . As one of the important structural proteins of TGEV particles, the M protein is exposed on the viral internal core [27] , and associates with the Golgi complex in the cell, which suggests that the M protein plays a mechanistic role at the site of virus assembly and budding [28] , and suggest that M is an indispensable component for the replication of virus particles in host cells. In this study, we constructed three shRNAs in a plasmid expression system that targeted the M gene and investigated whether shRNA-mediated RNA interference could inhibit TGEV infection of PK-15 cells.",

RNAi can regulate specific gene expression and is closely related to anti-virus replication. RNAi has an excellent prospect to improve the shortage of traditional anti-virus vaccines or related inhibitors. RNAi has emerged as a potentially important therapeutic antiviral strategy [8, [33] [34] [35] . Recently, several kinds of animal viruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [36, 37] , newcastle disease virus [38] , classical swine fever virus [39] , porcine circovirus [40] , infectious bursal disease virus [41] , and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus [42] have been silenced effectively, and most of these viruses are RNA viruses. TGEV is a porcine coronavirus with an RNA genome; therefore, it should also be sensitive to RNAi [43] . Several studies have reported the application of RNAi against TGEV replication. Effective suppression of TGEV infection in swine testicular (ST) cells was achieved using DNA-based vectors expressing siRNAs or shRNAs targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of TGEV [8, 15] . Lei he, et al. reported the effective inhibition of TGEV infection in ST cells or PK-15 cells using DNA-based vectors expressing an shRNA targeting the transcription of TGEV gene 7 (a non-structural gene) [4, 44] .

            "text": "In this study, we constructed three shRNAs plasmid expression systems to target the M gene and investigated whether shRNA-mediated RNA interference could inhibit TGEV infection in PK-15 cells. Our results demonstrated that the infection of TGEV in cell culture could be disrupted by shRNAs targeting the M gene of TGEV: two of the three shRNAs generated from the M gene of TGEV blocked viral infection efficiently. The CPE and TCID 50 assays revealed that cells transfected with pRNAT-1, pRNAT-2, and pRNAT-3, harboring three sequencespecific shRNAs, could trigger inhibition of TGEV infection at 48 h post-infection; pRNAT-2 in particular showed markedly suppression. Western blotting and qPCR analyses further confirmed that the efficient inhibition of viral infection was caused by viral degradation. However, the qPCR analysis showed that transfection with pRNAT-2 and pRNAT-3 inhibited viral infection by the equivalent of 70%. The qPCR analysis and western blotting assays also demonstrated that, compared with the mock control, the amount of viral RNAs in the pRNAT-1 group decreased a little, which suggested an inefficient inhibitory effect, which possibly indicated that the pRNAT-1 sequence results in non-specific inhibition or in 'off -target' effects. Overall, the variability of viral suppression could be related to the following two aspects. One is that the regulation of RNA transcription and protein expression is a very complex process, and represents the combined effect of various factors. The other possible explanation is the difference in the sensitivity and accuracy between TCID 50 and qPCR. qPCR is highly sensitive to detect the suppression effect of RNA interference. In addition to the potent inhibition shown by two sequence-specific shRNAs, the TCID 50 and qPCR analyses also demonstrated that, compared with the mock control, the amount of viral RNAs in the negative control pRNAT-NC cells also decreased a little, which suggested a non-specific effect on TGEV replication in PK-15 cells. Similarly, other researchers have discussed an ''off-target'' effect induced by siRNA or shRNA in their reports. Lu et al. [45] found that the non-specific effect was positively related to the concentration of the shRNAs. Overall, compared with the low-efficiency inhibition and 'off-target' effects of pRNAT-1, the other two sequencespecific shRNAs exhibited the potential to silence TGEV RNAs.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our results indicated that shRNAs targeting the M gene in TGEV genome could effectively block infection of TGEV in PK-15 cells. This finding showed that shRNAs could represent a potential novel tool against TGEV infection. These results also provided an insight into the inhibition of TGEV infection by targeting the M gene. Taken together, the present data and the known advantages of shRNA technology suggest that shRNA represents a candidate agent for TGEV therapeutic applications. ",
