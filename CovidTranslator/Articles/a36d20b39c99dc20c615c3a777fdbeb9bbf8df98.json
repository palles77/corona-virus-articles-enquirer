For both lung cancer and COPD, we first computed PAFs separately for smoking and solid-fuel use. COPD and lung cancer are caused by multiple risk factors acting simultaneously, and hence a proportion of deaths might be prevented by reducing exposure to either factor. 9,12,13 For example, some COPD deaths among smokers who cook with solid fuels may be prevented by smoking prevention or by use of clean fuels. As a result of multicausality, the PAFs for multiple risk factors overlap, and cannot be combined by simple addition. We estimated the PAFs for the combined effects of smoking and solid fuel, accounting for multicausality and avoiding double-counting the overlap of multiple risk factors: 9,12-14 PAF i =PAF of the i th risk factor n=number of risk factors Three conditions must hold when using the above equation. First, exposures to risks should be uncorrelated. The cross-province correlation coefficient between solid-fuel use and smoking, from the data sources described in webappendix 1, was 0\u00b704 (95% CI \u22120\u00b732 to 0\u00b740, p=0\u00b782) for men and \u22120\u00b711 (\u22120\u00b745 to 0\u00b726, p=0\u00b756) for women, indicating small and non-significant correlation. We also examined individual-level correlation with the 2006 panel from The China Health and Nutrition Survey (a multistage, random cluster survey, including 9788 adults in nine provinces throughout China with significant variation in socioeconomic and health status). 15 61% of men and 4% of women had ever smoked in homes that did not use solid fuels and 63% of men and 4% of women had ever smoked in homes that did. The odds ratios for smoking, comparing solid-fuel users to non-users, was 1\u00b707 (0\u00b795\u22121\u00b720) for men and 1\u00b702 (0\u00b776\u22121\u00b736) for women, showing uncorrelated exposures. The second condition is that the hazardous effects of one risk are not mediated through other risks. Smoking and solid-fuel combustion are both sources of respirable pollutants, but the effects of pollutants from one source are not mediated through exposure to the other. The third condition is that the proportional effects of one risk do not depend on exposure to the other risk factor. The proportional mortality study of smoking in China showed that the relative risks of lung cancer and respiratory-disease mortality among Chinese smokers were not modified by background disease levels, 16 which is consistent with no effect modification of relative risks between these two risks.",

We fitted a time-varying transmission parameter, defined as the rate at which infectious individuals are able to infect people who are susceptible. Available data and previous modelling suggested that the transmission parameter declined almost linearly in England and Wales from about 20 in 1900 to about 1 at the end of the 20th century. 19 We set the value of the transmission parameter to 20 in 1900, and it declined linearly to an empirically-fitted lower bound; the rate of decline and the lower bound were fitted to minimise the root mean square of the differences between the modelled and observed tuberculosis prevalence by province. The fitted lower bound, which determines tuberculosis incidence after 2000, was not sensitive to the initial transmission parameter in 1900. Model fitting also considered that chemotherapy was unavailable before 1960 20 and that the mean duration of disease is 2 years without treatment, 0\u00b78 years under effective DOTS (directly observed treatment, short course), and 1\u00b75 years for programmes other than effective DOTS. 21 We applied the calibrated model to estimate future tuberculosis incidence under different scenarios of smoking, solid-fuel use, and DOTS coverage.",

The future projections of the national population came from the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the UN Secretariat 32 and those of the disease-specific mortality from the global burden of disease study conducted by the WHO. Global burden of disease forecasts disease-specific mortality on the basis of projections of economic and social development, smoking, obesity, and selected other disease determinants. 1 We constructed scenarios that represent the range of policies and programmes that can reduce smoking and solid-fuel use on the basis of experiences and trends in other countries and some parts of China (tables 1 and 2 and webfigure 2). All scenarios covered a period of 30 years (2003\u221233). We constructed prevalence of risk factors over time in the scenarios for each province with a linear time trend, and aggregated the provincial prevalences to the national level. More than 99% of the tobacco market share in China is controlled by the Chinese National Tobacco Corporation. Tobacco prices and taxes are low and there are only a few tobacco control measures in place. 38 However, China ratified the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in October 2005, which came into effect in January, 2006. Future smoking prevalence will largely depend on the extent to which economic and regulatory approaches to tobacco control are pursued. Although male and female smoking prevalences probably have common policy determinants, the analyses of lung cancer and chronic disease mortality were done separately for men and women and included all sex-specific scenarios. The analysis for tuberculosis was done for men and women combined because relative risks were for both sexes combined and because there are indirect effects of smoking on tuberculosis between sexes. National adult smoking prevalence was 49\u00b76% for men and 3\u00b70% for women in 2003 according to the National Health Service Survey. Another National Tobacco Prevalence Survey in 2002 reported current smoking prevalence of 57\u00b74% for men and 2\u00b76% for women. The two surveys had slightly different definitions of current smoking. 22,33 Tobacco consumption per person in China peaked around 1990 and has declined slowly since then. 38 Data from three National Health Service Surveys (1993, 1998, 2003) show that smoking prevalence declined from 60\u00b73% to 49\u00b76% among men (standardised to the 2003 population); smoking in women declined from 4\u00b77% to 3\u00b70% in this period.",

But tuberculosis incidence can decline significantly because treatment reduces the risk of infection through reducing the duration of infectiousness. Nonetheless, smoking and solid-fuel interventions should be components of tuberculosis control for at least three reasons. First, irrespective of coverage and effectiveness of DOTS, risk-factor interventions can further reduce incidence of tuberculosis. The complementary effects of risk-factor interventions occur through reducing the risk of latent infection and progression from latent infection to infectious disease. Second, reducing smoking in patients with tuberculosis might further strengthen DOTS effectiveness because smoking has been associated with delayed response to treatment. 63 Third, reducing smoking may itself lower the risk of drug resistance as recent studies have suggested a link between smoking and drug-resistant tuberculosis. 64, 65 Our quantitative analysis of the effects of the two leading environmental and lifestyle sources of respirable pollutants on a common set of infectious and chronic diseases used models that incorporated the aetiological risk factors in disease incidence and mortality over time. Specifically, our models and data sources accounted for the fact that effects on lung cancer and COPD accumulate or reverse gradually after exposure begins or stops and for dependency of tuberculosis incidence on prevalent infectious cases. We used several large sources of data to reconstruct consistent and comparable trends of smoking, solid-fuel use, and tuberculosis in China's provinces. Scenarios were constructed on the basis of policy experiences in China and other countries, and can provide programme targets and benchmarks. Current and projected mortality from COPD and lung cancer from the global burden of disease analysis used Chinese mortality data sources and accounted for demographic and socioeconomic development. 1 The relative risks and how they change over time were based on meta-analyses and large highquality epidemiological studies in China and elsewhere.",

These analyses show that the largest source of uncertainty for the tuberculosis model is the future trend of transmission parameter, which depends on how sociodemographic change affects the patterns of contact and other determinants of transmission in China. If factors such as higher population density and increased travel increase the number of contacts that lead to tuberculosis transmission, the transmission parameter might not continue its expected decline. In this case, reducing smoking and indoor air pollution will have an even greater effect on tuberculosis control than estimated. For example, if the transmission parameter in Jiangsu doubles over the next 30 years, the benefits of the different scenarios of smoking, solid-fuel use would be 58\u221277% greater than the original analysis in figure 4 .

In addition to their disease burden, these diseases have large and inequitable household and societal economic burden associated with health-care costs, reduced labour-market participation, and decreased accumulation of human capital, described in detail elsewhere for China and for other developing countries. 68-72 Our results show that reducing common risk factors could have a substantial effect on future burden of COPD and lung cancer, and be an important contributor to tuberculosis control. Our findings have several potential policy and programme implications at the national, community, household, or individual levels. At the national level, our results on the projected burden of disease from COPD and lung cancer alone reinforce the need for regulatory and economic policies that reduce smoking and promote clean household energy sources in China. Tuberculosis control however cannot rely on risk-factor reduction as its main intervention, and the core of national or regional tuberculosis control programmes should remain interventions that can reduce and eventually interrupt transmission under generalisable circumstances, currently DOTS. Nonetheless, at the community level, some interventions could increase the coverage or community effectiveness of others. For example, case detection and treatment completion under DOTS in China have been constrained by limitations of physical and human infrastructure, financial factors, and compliance, especially in rural areas and marginalised social groups. 73-76 Low-income or marginalised communities could be enrolled in programmes that provide cleaner fuels or stoves and nutritional supplements, conditional on periodic tuberculosis tests and DOTS treatment completion. At the individual level, tobacco cessation can be added to tuberculosis treatment, possibly with financial incentives. 77,78 If multiple interventions are implemented, the management structure of DOTS, including its standardised approach to registration, recording, and reporting of enrolled individuals (or households) and their status in receiving intervention, can strengthen planning and implementation of interventions for indoor air pollution and smoking. 79 Tobacco taxes might also be used to subsidise DOTS, clean energy technology, and nutrition for low-income households that take part in integrated programmes. An important next step would be a policy dialogue between the different economic, energy, and health-sector agencies in China as well as community-based intervention studies that assess the effectiveness of combining risk factor interventions with tuberculosis case finding and treatment under actual conditions of implementation.",

To incorporate this effect in the solid-fuel scenarios, we used the current and projected urban and rural population share from the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat. 32 The national change in relative proportion of urban and rural population over time was applied to all provinces.
