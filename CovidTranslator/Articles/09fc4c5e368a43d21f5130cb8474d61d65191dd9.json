To address these issues, we have systematically modified siRNA with the synthetic RNA-like high affinity nucleotide analogue, Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA). Here, we show that incorporation of LNA substantially enhances serum half-life of siRNA's, which is a key requirement for therapeutic use. Moreover, we provide evidence that LNA is compatible with the intracellular siRNA machinery and can be used to reduce undesired, sequence-related off-target effects. LNA-modified siRNAs targeting the emerging disease SARS, show improved efficiency over unmodified siRNA on certain RNA motifs. The results from this study emphasize LNA's promise in converting siRNA from a functional genomics technology to a therapeutic platform.",

Here, critical advances have come from the development of nucleotide analogues with improved properties over natural nucleotides and recently several of these such as phosphorothioates (8, 9) , 2 0 -O-Me (10,11), 2 0 -O-allyl (10) and 2 0 -deoxy-fluorouridine (8, 9) have been examined as a means to improve the prospect for siRNA therapy. Briefly, these studies have demonstrated that siRNAs can accommodate quite a number of modifications at both base-paired and non-base-paired positions without significant loss of activity. Moreover, some of the modified siRNAs were found to exhibit enhanced serum stability (11) and longer duration of action (10) . Modification of the 5 0 end of the antisense strand with 2 0 -O-allyl (10) or chemical blocking of the 5 0 -hydroxyl group (11) resulted in a dramatic loss in activity consistent with the proposed in vivo requirement for 5 0 end phosphorylation. Also, more substantial modifications, such as total modification by 2 0 -O-Me (8) or PS modifications of every second or all internucleoside linkages (8, 9) increased cytotoxic effects and resulted in a significant decrease or complete loss of activity.",

In this report, we expand on these early findings by systematically pursuing the construction and biological testing of LNA-modified siRNA molecules, hereafter termed siLNA, aiming at in vivo applications. We show that LNA is substantially compatible with the siRNA machinery, and that siLNAs exhibit greatly improved bio-stability and shows enhanced inhibition at certain RNA targets. We further show that LNA can be used to reduce sequence-related off-target effects by either lowering incorporation of the siRNA sense-strand and/or by reducing the ability of inappropriately loaded sense-strands to cleave the target RNA.",

A priori, this suggests that LNA may be used to increase the functional half-life of siRNA in vivo by two different mechanisms, e.g. by enhancing the resistance of the constituent RNA strands against degradation by single-stranded RNases and by stabilizing the siRNA duplex structure that is critical for activity. To investigate how these mechanisms influence overall biostability, we assessed the integrity in fetal bovine serum, as well as human and mouse serum, of either unmodified siRNA or siLNAs that were modified to enhance exonuclease resistance (siLNA5) or further modified to also increase duplex stability (siLNA7). Briefly, siLNA5 has LNA modifications at the 3 0 ends and exhibits a duplex stability similar to the unmodified siRNA1 (T m = 69.7 C for siLNA5 and 70.5 C for siRNA1) whereas siLNA7 has six additional duplex stabilizing sense strand modifications at base-paired positions which increases its T m to >90 C. As shown in Figure 1a and b, unmodified siRNA (siRNA1) was markedly degraded after 6 h during which it produces a smear of faster migrating species. A similar diffuse band was not observed with the 3 0 end protected siLNA5, which in contrast to the unmodified siRNA showed only weak signs of degradation after 24 h. The more modified siLNA7 had a striking stability and showed no signs of degradation even at 48 h. When incubated in either undiluted human or mouse serum (Figure 1c and d) , the unmodified siRNA1 were fully degraded within 6 h. An increased degradation rate was also observed with the siLNA5 where little fulllength product remained at 24 h. In contrast, siLNA7 remained intact for the full 48 h of the assay in both human and mouse serum.",

As shown in Figure 2a , the firefly siRNA (siRNA1) effectively and selectively reduced firefly luciferase activity whereas an unrelated siRNA control was essentially without effect. Introduction of LNA modifications in the 3 0 overhangs in either or both strands of the firefly siRNA revealed no loss of inhibitory effect (siLNA1-3). One LNA in the 5 0 end of the sense strand was fully compatible with activity (siLNA4 and 5), while an LNA at the 5 0 end of the antisense strand (siLNA8-11) dramatically impaired the inhibitory effect. To exclude the possibility that this impairment was due to a lack of a 5 0 phosphate, which has been shown to be crucial for siRNA function (27) , the 5 0 end of the antisense strand in siLNA8 and 11 was phosphorylated in vitro. However, this procedure did not recover any of the lost effect (data not shown). SiLNAs wherein the sense strand was modified in the 3 0 overhangs and at as many as seven basepaired positions (siLNA6 and 7) retained significant inhibitory activity whereas siLNAs comprising various combinations of either fully modified sense or antisense strands did not have any inhibitory effect (data not shown).",

Although we cannot exclude that these modifications somehow prevent loading of the antisense strand into RISC, we believe this to be unlikely given the functionality of many significantly more modified siLNAs. Rather, as these positions are all close to the site where RNA target cleavage occurs [between pos. 10 and 11 of the siRNA strand counting from the 5 0 end (28)], we suspect that the LNA modifications may exert a direct conformational or functional effect on the catalytic site.",

However, when tested for sense strand activity, the outcome was different. Here, the siRNA showed clear downregulation of the target (pS3Xas), albeit the effect was less than that observed with the antisense strand. In contrast, no activity was observed with the siLNA sense strand strongly supporting the conclusion that the 5 0 sense LNA modification has altered strand-bias in favour of incorporation of the antisense strand. Both siRNA and siLNA were also tested against the control plasmid pGL3 and found to have no effect on luciferase expression. Improving on low efficacy siRNAs As described above, incorporation of sense strand may decrease the potency of siRNAs by simply lowering the number of RISC complexes loaded with the antisense strand. Having established that 5 0 sense LNA appeared able to redirect strand loading, we next examined whether these modifications would also be able to improve the potency of two inefficient siRNAs targeting Renilla luciferase, siRNA4 and 5 (23) . Both of these siRNAs have a strong G:C base-pair at their antisense end and a weak A:U base-pair at their 5 0 sense end (Table 1) making it likely that at least part of the poor activity could be due to strand incorporation of the sense strand.

Notably, LNA offers the means to improve dramatically the half-life of siRNAs through a combination of enhanced nuclease stability and stabilization of the duplex structure. As this property can be obtained with a modest number of LNA modifications that do not affect the ability of the siRNA to mediate target knockdown, we expect that siLNAs may exhibit significantly enhanced efficacy when administered in vivo compared to their unmodified counterparts.",

We have identified these activity-impairing positions (pos. 10, 12 and 14) by systematically analysing a whole set of single LNA insertions in the antisense strand and found them to be in the vicinity of the target cleavage site. The evidence that similar substitutions applied to the sense strand will have a similar effect is indirect. Nevertheless, we see no reason to believe this will not be the case. If so, the combination of two or more activity-impairing LNA modifications may facilitate complete loss of activity of RISC complexes inappropriately loaded with sense strands.",

Based on the present data, we can only speculate as to the underlying causes which may include changes in siRNA structure that affect RISC loading, problems with unwinding the duplex due to excessive thermo-stability, changes in release kinetics after substrate cleavage, etc. Whatever the cause, as we have shown, the potential key therapeutic benefits of introducing LNA into siRNAs can all be achieved with relative few modifications that do not compromise siRNA activity.

(b) Effect of siRNA and siLNA on SARS-induced cytotoxicity depending on the target sequence (SARS 1-3). Vero cells were transfected with 85 nM siRNA or siLNA and then infected with 6000 TCID50 SARS-CoV. SARSinduced cytotoxicity was assessed 50 h later. The untransfected but infected sample was set to 100% cytotoxicity.
