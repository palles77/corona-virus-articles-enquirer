Inhibition of tumor cell adhesion can be an antitumor strategy. Guanosine-rich (G-rich) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) can inhibit the adhesion of certain tumor cells. However, no data exist on how inclusion of the CpG motif in the G-rich sequence influences tumor cell adhesion and subsequent tumorigenesis. In this study, in vitro and in vivo assays were used to evaluate how a panel of ODN-containing contiguous guanosines and the CpG motif influenced adhesion of B16 melanoma cells. The results showed that a self-designed ODN, named BW001, containing the polyG motif and a full phosphorothioate modification backbone could inhibit B16 melanoma cell adhesion on a culture plate or on a plate coated with various substances. In vivo data revealed that B16 melanoma cells co-administered with BW001 and intraperitoneally injected into mice formed fewer tumor colonies in peritoneal cavities. This effect was related to the polyG motif and the full phosphorothioate modification backbone and enhanced by the existence of the CpG motif. Additional in vivo data showed that survival of tumor-bearing mice in the BW001 group was significantly prolonged, subcutaneous melanoma developed much more slowly, and lung dissemination colonies formed much less often than in mice inoculated with B16 melanoma cells only. The effect was CpG motif-dependent. These results suggest that BW001 may exert an integrated antitumor effect.",

            "text": "Both guanosine-rich (G-rich) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) and CpG ODNs are a promising new type of therapeutic agent for malignant tumors. G-rich ODNs (GROs) can induce multiple antitumor effects such as stimulation of the immune system, inhibition of a tumor cell's proliferation or adhesion, and mediation of cell apoptosis (Bates et al, 2009) . Similarly, CpG ODN also exhibits various antitumor effects such as inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse model by recognition of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) expressed in dendritic cells and B cells Sommariva et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2012) , and induction of tumor cell apoptosis or inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in vitro by reacting with TLR9 overexpressed in certain tumor strains (El Andaloussi et al., 2006; Zent et al., 2012) . Among these effects, the tumor adhesion-inhibiting potential of ODN has been relatively rarely reported. Khaled et al. first reported that phosphorothioate (PS) ODN, with more than 4 contiguous guanosines, could inhibit cell adhesion in vitro (Khaled et al., 1996) . Another research group also provided evidence that a contiguous 4guanosine sequence in c-myelocytomatosis oncogene (c-myc) antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides could inhibit the growth of human lung cancer cells by possible involvement with cell adhesion inhibition (Saijo et al., 1997) . However, there are still no detailed data on the effect of the inclusion of the CpG motif on the anti-adhesive potential of GRO.",

We found that candidate ODNs with a sequence containing more than 4 contiguous guanosines and full PS modification could inhibit B16 melanoma cell adherence, spread, and proliferation in various in vitro and ex vivo assays. The anti-adhesive potential was not CpG motif-dependent. However, a series of in vivo experiments demonstrated that one of the above-mentioned candidate ODNs containing the CpG motif, named BW001, which has been proven to have strong effects against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (Bao et al., 2006) and Coxsackie B3 virus (Cong et al., 2007) , outshone other ODN candidates due to its tumorigenesis-inhibiting effects. These effects included decreasing tumor colony formation in the peritoneal cavity, prolonging the survival time of tumorbearing mice, delaying the growth of subcutaneous tumors, and inhibiting lung dissemination of B16 cells. In summary, we are the first to report that PS ODN containing polyguanosine (polyG) and CpG motifs can inhibit tumor cell adhesion in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo.",

First, we found that BW002, the guanine-cytosine (GC)reversed form of BW001, had an effect similar to that of BW001 ( p > 0.05) (Fig. 1A) . But partPSBW001 or NStailBW001, respectively, representing the form of only the polyG tail to be phosphorothioated or the backbone to be phosphorothioated of BW001, could not inhibit the adhesion of B16 cells ( p > 0.05 vs. PBS) (Fig. 1A) . Furthermore, we replaced the polyG motif at the 3\u00a2 end of BW001 with polyA, polyC, or polyT, respectively, designated as (polyA)BW001, (polyC)BW001, and (polyT)BW001, which failed to inhibit the adhesion of B16 cells ( p > 0.05 vs. PBS) (Fig. 1B) . However, there was no influence on the anti-adhesive activity of the BW001 when the position of the polyG motif was changed from the 3\u00a2 end into the middle of the sequence (which was named Ctr-3026, p < 0.001 vs. PBS; p > 0.05 vs. BW001) (Fig. 1C) . Then, we decreased a guanine base in the polyG tail of BW001 to form a new ODN named BW001-1 with 5 contiguous guanosines, which still possessed adhesioninhibiting activity ( p < 0.001 vs. PBS), rather than BW001-2 *BW001-6 with 4 or fewer than 4 guanosines ( p > 0.05 vs. PBS) (Fig. 1D ). Next, we tested the influence of a series of BW001-like ODNs with full-PS structure and the polyG motif on the adhesion activity of the B16 cells. As shown in Fig. 1E , all these BW001-like ODNs could inhibit adhesion of the B16 cells ( p < 0.001 vs. PBS; p > 0.05 vs. BW001). The data show that the B16 cell adhesion-inhibiting activity of BW001 depends on the existence of a full-PS backbone and more than four contiguous guanosines, but in a CpG motif-independent manner.",

We therefore used FN and collagen type 1 to mimic the ECM and observe the influence of BW001 on the adhesion of B16 cells to the ECM. We found that the number of adherent B16 cells was less in the BW001 wells than in the PBS wells in the plate coated by FN (Fig. 3A) or type 1 collagen (Fig. 3B) . Moreover, when B16 cells were added to the plate pre-coated by the mixture of BW001 with FN or type 1 collagen, the adhesion rate was reduced only in the wells coated by FN plus BW001 (Fig. 3C) , rather than in the wells coated by collagen plus BW001 (Fig. 3D) .

Melanoma easily disseminates to the lung, so the adhesion of melanoma cells to lung tissue is crucial for lung metastasis (Karmali et al., 2011) . To identify the effect of BW001 on the adhesion of B16 cells to lung tissue, we incubated a mixture of PKH-26-stained B16 cells with BW001 on a fresh cryostat section of mouse lung tissue and calculated the number of adherent cells under the fluorescent microscope. As shown in Fig. 5 , there were significantly fewer adherent cells in the BW001 group than in the PBS group ( p < 0.001), suggesting that BW001 can inhibit the adhesion of melanoma cells to lung tissue.",

BW001 can inhibit the adhesion of melanoma in vitro and delay tumor growth in vivo; nevertheless, in the present study, BW002 without the CpG motif only decreased colony formation of melanoma in the peritoneal cavity. These results are different from previously reported data that polyG is essential for the antitumor effect, but the CpG motif only augments the effect (Shen et al., 2002) . Furthermore, BW001 still had an antitumor effect when being separately injected with tumor cells, even though the effect was weaker than that in the co-injection group in the i.p. model. However, it had no effect on the lung metastasis model, suggesting there are different mechanisms induced by BW001 to inhibit the growth of original and metastatic melanoma. Macrophages are abundant in the peritoneal cavity. CpG ODN can recognize TLR9 expressed in macrophages and stimulate tumor necrosis factor-alpha production by macrophages to indirectly induce an antitumor effect (Kuramoto et al., 2006) . Suzuki et al. reported that TLR9-defective pulmonary alveoli macrophages had no reaction to CpG ODN (Suzuki et al., 2005) , indicating that the effects of BW001 are possibly correlated with activation of the macrophages. In addition, paratumoral or intratumoral injection of CpG ODN can exert an integrated antitumor effect by stimulating activation of natural killer cells and CD8 + T cell (Auf et al., 2002; Lonsdorf et al., 2003) , and inducing specific immune memory (Heckelsmiller et al., 2002) . However, BW001, as an A-type CpG ODN, has a strong stimula-tion effect on the human immune system (Bao et al., 2006; Cong et al., 2007) but weak activation on the mouse immune system (data not shown), suggesting that BW001 might induce a stronger antitumor effect in the human counterpart melanoma model.",

GRO can inhibit tumor cell proliferation (Dapi\u0107 et al., 2002) , delay the tumor cell cycle (Schwartz et al., 2008) , exert cytotoxic effects (Goodchild et al., FIG. 9 . Lung metastasis colony formation. (A, B) On day 0, suspensions of 3.5 \u00b7 10 5 B16 cells in a volume of 100 mL containing indicated ODN (25 mg per mouse) were injected into lateral tail veins of female C57BL/6 mice. On day 21, mice were sacrificed, lung tissues were separated (A) and the melanoma colony numbers on lung surface were counted (B). (C, D) Female C57BL/6 mice were injected with BW001 (25 mg per mouse) into lateral tail vein 1 hour earlier than tumor challenge. Co-administration of tumor cell and ODN was used as control group. Lung tissue of each mouse was seperated (C) and melanoma colony numbers on lung surface were counted (D). Colony numbers of each mouse are represented by open circles. The geometric mean of each group is indicated by a horizontal bar. Statistical significance was determined using the nonparametric test; p values are shown between ODN and PBS. 2007) , and induce tumor cell apoptosis (Qi et al., 2006) . All these effects are dependent on G-quadruplex formation (Dapi\u0107 et al., 2003) . In our study, BW001 with G-quartets could inhibit B16 cell adherence and decrease cell proliferation in an in vitro assay. The tumor growth-inhibiting activity of BW001 in vivo became weaker when the polyG tail was removed, further confirming the integrated antitumor effect of GRO. Based on these results, we will design more experiments to explore the other effects of BW001, for example, cytotoxicity other than an anti-adhesive effect on the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo.",

We repeated the procedures three times, and found a similar phenomenon in which the mice immediately expired with co-administration of B16 cells and BW002. However, there was no such incident in the BW001 group (not all data shown), suggesting that the mixture of B16 cells and BW002 must form massive tumor pulmonary emboli and cause sudden death of mice (Chan et al., 2000) . Therefore, it is possible that BW002 may more easily form intramolecular duplexes by itself or exist intermolecular interaction between BW002 and the surface molecular on B16 cells. This provides a new direction for further research.",

Furthermore, we also observed that the gel formed by collagen type 1 was brittle and easier to break when BW001 was added to the collagen suspension (data not shown). This suggests the possibility that BW001 partially inhibits melanoma growth by hampering the formation of the ECM network. In addition, since both FN and collagen are important participatory components in abdominal adhesion, which is a common complication of surgery and chemotherapy (van Rijswijk et al., 1997; Uzunkoy et al., 2005) , we suggest that BW001 might induce a comprehensive effect, including inhibiting melanoma reoccurrence and metastasis, while also reducing the formation of abdominal adhesions after surgery and chemotherapy.",
