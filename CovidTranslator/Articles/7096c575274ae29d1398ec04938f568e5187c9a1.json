However, the mode of virus transmission is not well understood. The findings of epidemiological and virological studies prompted us to hypothesize that the human gastrointestinal tract could serve as an alternative route to acquire MERS-CoV infection. We demonstrated that human primary intestinal epithelial cells, small intestine explants, and intestinal organoids were highly susceptible to MERS-CoV and can sustain robust viral replication. We also identified the evidence of enteric MERS-CoV infection in the stool specimen of a clinical patient. MERS-CoV was considerably resistant to fed-state gastrointestinal fluids but less tolerant to highly acidic fasted-state gastric fluid.",

Notably, direct intragastric inoculation of MERS-CoV caused a lethal infection in human DPP4 transgenic mice. Histological examination revealed MERS-CoV enteric infection in all inoculated mice, as shown by the presence of virus-positive cells, progressive inflammation, and epithelial degeneration in small intestines, which were exaggerated in the mice pretreated with the proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole. With the progression of the enteric infection, inflammation, virus-positive cells, and live viruses emerged in the lung tissues, indicating the development of sequential respiratory infection. Taken together, these data suggest that the human intestinal tract may serve as an alternative infection route for MERS-CoV.",

The clinical spectrum of MERS ranged from asymptomatic or mild respiratory disease to acute fulminant pneumonia with respiratory distress syndrome or multiorgan failure resulting in a fatal outcome. Common symptoms were fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Gastrointestinal symptoms were among the most commonly reported extrapulmonary clinical features of MERS; about one-third of MERS patients had gastrointestinal tract symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (3, 4) .",

MERS-CoV-infected camels, especially the juvenile ones, were found to shed a large amount of the virus from the upper respiratory tract (6) . Camel milk may also play a role in the transmission of MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV could be detected in 41.7% of milk samples collected from lactating camels, which also actively shed the virus in nasal secretion and/or feces (7) . In addition, MERS-CoV can survive in camel milk for a pro longed period (8) . The consumption of unpasteurized camel milk was found to be a source of infection in some MERS patients (9) . Thus, it is generally believed that primary infection, that is, MERS-CoV transmission from camel to human, is mediated via respiratory droplet and/or saliva during direct contact with camels or through consumption of camel milk or undercooked camel meat (10) .",

            "text": "Meanwhile, a large proportion of MERS cases occurred in healthcare settings, in which respiratory droplets of MERS patients as well as direct or indirect contact have been postulated to be important for virus transmission (3, 11) . Theoretically, human-to-human virus transmission mediated by respiratory droplets (>5 \uf06dm in size) occurs within 1 to 2 m from a source patient. However, history of direct contact can be inferred in only about 10% of patients in the largest hospital-associated MERS outbreak reported so far, which occurred in the Republic of Korea, with 186 infection cases in 2015 (12) . Most of the cases in this large-scale outbreak were those who shared the same healthcare environment without direct contact with MERS patients. Therefore, fomite transmission may explain a significant proportion of the infections (12) . The virological evidence to support fomite transmission is that MERS-CoV remains stable at low temperatures and 1 low humidity, and could be recovered after exposure to the environment for 48 hours (13) . Accordingly, viral RNA can be extensively detected in the environmental surfaces in rooms of MERS patients (14) . Given that fomite transmission may play a role in the outbreak in healthcare settings, acquisition of MERS-CoV infection via the gastrointestinal tract should be seriously considered. Collectively, in both camel-to-human transmission and human-to-human transmission, there is a possibility that humans may acquire MERS-CoV infection upon exposure to the virus through the gastrointestinal tract.",

The analysis of protein sequences of these two proteins of MERS-CoV suggests that MERS-CoV belongs to a category of coronaviruses that have relatively hard inner and outer shells; therefore, it may persist in the environment for a prolonged period and may have an oral-fecal transmission ability (16) . The bioinformatically predicted MERS-CoV survival upon environmental exposure has been experimentally corroborated (13) . Here, we sought to elucidate whether the gastrointestinal tract could be an alternative infection route for MERS-CoV and whether the exposure of MERS-CoV to the gastrointestinal tract can subsequently lead to a respiratory infection. To this end, we performed in vitro studies in human primary intestinal epithelial cells, intestinal explants, polarized Caco-2 cells, and human intestinal organoids, as well as an in vivo study in human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) transgenic mice.",

To this end, human primary intestinal epithelial cells were cultured for 1 week for differentiation. The differentiated epithelial cells were inoculated with MERS-CoV and were fixed at 24 hours post-infection (hpi) for immunofluorescence staining to identify the virus-positive cell. Almost all the inoculated intestinal epithelial cells highly expressed MERS-CoV NP, whereas no viral protein was detectable in mock-infected cells (Fig. 1A ). In addition, the infected cells underwent significant membrane fusion and formed syncytia. Consistent with the intensive expression of viral protein, the viral load increased by more than 1 log in the MERS-CoVinoculated epithelial cells ( fig. S1 ). To further verify the infectivity of MERS-CoV in human intestinal epithelium, normal human small intestine from a surgical resection was obtained with informed consent and used for MERS-CoV inoculation. Despite tissue degradation, immunofluorescence staining explicitly revealed NP-positive enterocytes in the infected intestine (Fig. 1B) at 20 hpi. The infected enterocytes formed syncytia similar to those in the primary cells. Although only patchy areas of epithelium were infected, we observed an increased viral load of about 1 log in the Matrigel and medium, as well as in the infected explants (Fig. 1C) . Thus, human primary intestinal epithelial cells and small intestine can be infected by MERS-CoV and support viral replication.",

Notably, N sgRNA was detected in the specimen and was confirmed by sequencing the qPCR product, which showed a typical sgRNA sequence with fused leader sequence, the predicted transcription regulatory site (TRS), and the body element of N gene (Fig. 1D ). The presence of N sgRNA in the stool specimen suggested that MERS-CoV probably infected and replicated in the alimentary tract of the MERS patient.

The infected intestinoids developed progressive cytopathic effects over time. Thus, normalized viral loads in the infected intestinoids exhibited a constant increment within the 48-hour observation window (Fig. 2B) . Accordingly, plaque assays revealed a significantly increased viral titer of 3 log units in the Matrigel and medium at 48 hpi (Fig. 2C ). The infection efficiency of MERS-CoV in intestinoids, that is, the percentage of MERS-CoV-infected intestinal epithelial cells, was also examined with flow cytometry. At 2 hpi, about 5% of the cells within the intestinoids were MERS-CoV NP-positive. The percentage of NP-positive cells significantly increased to approximately 25% at 24 hpi (Fig. 2 , D and E), suggesting a productive virus infection and spread in the intestinoids. The productive MERS-CoV infection in intestinoids was also evidenced by a strong signal of viral NP in the virus-inoculated intestinoids, albeit absent in the mockinfected organoids (Fig. 2F ). In addition, we verified the expression of the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4, a major determinant for tissue tropism of MERS-CoV, in intestinal epithelial cells by immunofluorescence staining (fig. S2 ).

Accordingly, the active caspase-3-positive cells, which underwent virus-induced apoptosis, were significantly more abundant in apical inoculation than in basolateral inoculation (P = 0.001).

The hDPP4 mouse experiments were performed using our previously established mouse model of MERS-CoV infection (23) . First, nine female mice were inoculated with 10 5 PFU of MERS-CoV via intragastric gavage; three of them were pretreated with a proton pump inhibitor, pantoprazole, to improve the viability of MERS-CoV in the mouse stomach because the in vitro experiment suggested the acid lability of MERS-CoV. At day 5 after virus inoculation, three pantoprazole-pretreated mice and three phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-pretreated mice were sacrificed. At day 8 after inoculation, two mice lost more than 10% of their body weight and were sacrificed, whereas one mouse succumbed to the infection. Thus, direct intragastric MERS-CoV inoculation in hDPP4 mice may result in a lethal infection. To characterize the early events after intragastric MERS-CoV inoculation, nine female hDPP4 mice were inoculated via intragastric gavage; three mice were sacrificed at days 1, 3, and 5 after challenge, respectively. In addition, to exclude possible virus access to the airway during intragastric gavage, we directly injected 10 5 PFU of MERS-CoV into the stomach (intragastric injection hereafter) of 12 hDPP4 mice after a minor laparotomy. Six mice were pretreated with pantoprazole or mock-treated with PBS before the inoculation; three mice of each group were sacrificed at days 3 and 5 after inoculation.",

            "text": "Histopathological examination revealed that small intestines of all intragastrically inoculated mice displayed increased mononuclear cell infiltration in the lamina propria, with broadening of the intestinal villi and increased sloughing of surface epithelium. The intervening mucosa was basically normal. Figure 5A (a to c) shows the pathology of small intestines in the mice sacrificed at days 1, 3, and 5 after inoculation, respectively, indicating deteriorating inflammation and epithelial degeneration after virus inoculation. The pantoprazole-treated mice sacrificed at day 5 displayed more extensive and more prominent pathology in small intestine than the PBS-treated mice (Fig. 5A, d and e) . The mock-infected mouse showed a negligible pathological change in the intestines (Fig. 5A, f ) . Immunofluorescence staining was performed to identify the viral antigen (NP)-positive cell in the intestines of the inoculated mice. It was shown that intestinal epithelial cells were intensively infected at day 1 after inoculation (Fig. 5B, a to  c) . The infected cells were patchily distributed in the surface epithelia of small intestines (Fig. 5B, a and b) . In some areas, the infected enterocytes formed syncytia (Fig. 5B, c, and fig. S4, A and B) . At days 5 and 8 after inoculation, the NP-positive cells were distributed more widely in small intestines and emerged in the lamina propria (arrows in Fig. 5B , d to f) and Peyer's patch (arrowhead in Fig. 5B, d) . Double staining of viral NP and CD68 revealed that some infected cells in the lamina propria were macrophages (Fig. 5B, f) . Consistent with the mas-sive inflammatory infiltration in small intestines of the inoculated mice as shown by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, CD3-positive lymphocytes were more abundant in the infected mice (Fig. 5B, a, b , and e) than those in the mock-infected mouse (Fig. 5B, h) . Although there was no overt pathology in colon epithelium, NP-positive epithelial cells were nevertheless sparsely distributed in colon epithelium of infected mice (Fig. 5B, g) . The viral load increased in small intestines of intragastrically injected mice, especially in the pantoprazole-pretreated mice (Fig. 5C) , indicating a correlation between viral replication and intestinal pathology. However, the attempt to identify live virus from the intestine failed because the inoculation of the intestine homogenates, even the diluted homogenates, caused significant cell death and detachment of the monolayers. In the early phase up to day 5 after virus inoculation, the lung tissues of the inoculated mice showed minimal degree of inflammation (Fig. 6A, a) . However, the pantoprazole-pretreated mice, which were sacrificed at the same day after inoculation, exhibited prominent pulmonary inflammation (Fig. 6A, b and c) . Histological examination revealed marked infiltration of mononuclear cells and lymphocytes in the alveolar septa, indicating interstitial inflammation. Without pantoprazole pretreatment, the mice also exhibited inflammatory infiltration in the lung tissue at day 8 after intragastric gavage (Fig. 6A,  d) . Notably, NP-positive pneumocytes were identified in these mice (Fig. 6A, f) . As expected, the abundance and distribution of viruspositive cells in the lung tissues of intragastrically inoculated mice were more limited than those in the intranasally inoculated mouse ( fig. S4C) . Consistent with the viral propagation in small intestines of intragastrically injected mice, viral load was elevated in the lung tissues of these mice at day 5 after inoculation, particularly in the pantoprazolepretreated mice (Fig. 6B) . Notably, infectious virions were detected in the lung homogenates of the intragastrically injected mice at day 5 after inoculation by plaque assay (fig. S5 ), which further verified the lung infection in these mice (Fig. 6A ). We and others (24, 25) observed brain infection in the intranasally inoculated hDPP4 mice. Likewise, the intragastrically injected mice also developed brain infection. Infectious virions were detected in the brain homogenates at day 5 after infection ( fig. S5 ). The infected mice exhibited increased viral loads in the brain tissues. In summary, the direct intragastric MERS-CoV inoculation initiated an infection in the intestinal mucosa, leading to progressive inflammation and epithelial degeneration. With the progression of intestinal MERS-CoV infection, a sequential respiratory infection occurred.",

Epidemiological studies, biological evaluation of the virus, and bioinformatic prediction collectively suggested that humans may also acquire MERS-CoV infection via the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we aimed to elucidate whether the gastrointestinal tract could serve as an alternative route to acquire MERS-CoV infection and whether gastrointestinal tract exposure to MERS-CoV may eventually lead to a respiratory infection.",

We further characterized MERS-CoV infection and replication in human intestinoids (Fig. 2) , a novel ex vivo model system that can faithfully simulate the in vivo human intestinal epithelium. Notably, MERS-CoV replicated more robustly in human intestinoids than in primary respiratory epithelial cells and ex vivo lung tissues (27, 28) . The MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 is known as the major determinant of host and tissue tropisms in MERS-CoV (29) . According to the public database Human Protein Atlas, human small intestine expresses the highest level of DPP4 mRNA and protein among all human organs, including lung and bronchus. Thus, the abundantly expressed DPP4 in human intestine may account for high susceptibility of these cells to MERS-CoV.",

It was documented that enveloped coronaviruses, unlike most enveloped viruses, are notably resistant to bile salts (30) . Here, we verified the stability of MERS-CoV in bile salts in a very stringent setting, where the viruses were incubated with 10 volumes of FeSSIF containing a high concentration of bile salts. However, the acid instability of MERS-CoV shown in Fig. 3 seemed paradoxical, now that the intragastric inoculation of MERS-CoV caused the enteric infection in hDPP4 mice. Coincidently, an earlier study with a similar experimental setting documented the acid lability of rotavirus (31), a typical gastrointestinal virus that commonly causes gastroenteritis in mammals. In our study, apart from the same pH of 2.0 as in the previous study, pepsin was additionally supplemented to better simulate the authentic fasted-state gastric fluid. Thus, the lability of MERS-CoV in highly acidic FaSSGF, as shown in the in vitro assay, was probably an exaggerated result. In a real-life scenario, especially during food intake, the virus may not be exposed to such a large volume of pure gastrointestinal fluids as in the experimental setting.",

            "text": "MERS-CoV intestinal infection was hinted in an earlier study of intranasally inoculated hDPP4 mice (24) , in which an increasing viral load was observed in mouse intestines after MERS-CoV inoculation. Here, we characterized MERS-CoV enteric infection in hDPP4 transgenic mice. After intragastric inoculation, the hDPP4 mice displayed viral antigen (NP)-positive cells, deteriorating inflammation, and epithelial degeneration in small intestines (Fig. 5, A and B) . The viral NP-positive cells, which were distributed focally at day 1 after inoculation, became more diffuse in intestinal mucosa over time (Fig. 5B) . In Transwell culture, the infected Caco-2 cells can release progeny virions apically and basolaterally (Fig. 4) . Thus, it was not unexpected that NP-positive cells appeared in the lamina propria and lymphoid tissue of small intestine as the enteric infection progressed (Fig. 5B) . Likewise, it is conceivable that the viruses produced in the intestinal mucosa of hDPP4 mouse may access the lymph flow and/or the bloodstream via the abundant lymphatic vessels and venules in the lamina propria of small intestine, respectively; they could be further transported to right heart via the thoracic duct and superior vena cava, and are disseminated to the lungs. The intragastrically inoculated mice exhibited minimal lung pathology at the early phase. Interstitial pneumonia occurred as the enteric infection developed; meanwhile, NP-positive cells emerged in the pulmonary parenchyma (Fig. 6A) . Correspondingly, live viruses were identified in the lung homogenates of intragastrically injected mice, in which aspiration of the virus inoculum into airway was basically excluded. Consistent with the possibility of hematogenous viral trafficking, the lung tissues of intragastrically inoculated mice showed prominent interstitial pneumonia with thickened alveolar septa and mononuclear cell filtration. As frequently reported in the intranasally inoculated hDPP4 mice, brain infection also occurred in our intragastrically infected mice ( fig. S5) . Thus, further investigation is required to exclude the possibility that the dysfunctional brainstem due to brain infection may be attributable to the lung infection. Nevertheless, our results indicated that the MERS-CoV pulmonary infection in hDPP4 mice was secondary to the intestinal infection. Clinically, respiratory symptoms may not be the initial presentations of MERS patients (32, 33) . Respiratory infection as a subsequent manifestation was documented in some MERS patients, whose onset of symptoms was diarrhea and fever. In a case report, lung inflammation was an incidental finding on chest radiograph. The patient subsequently developed severe respiratory disease and died (34) .",

            "text": "Virus dissemination and infection of other organs after gastrointestinal tract exposure occur in other viruses. For example, the direct intragastric inoculation of the avian influenza virus H5N1 in ferrets and hamsters caused systemic viral dissemination via the bloodstream (35) . Human picornavirus, hepatitis A virus, enters the bloodstream after infecting human intestinal epithelium and ultimately establishes infection in the liver (36) . Apart from the respiratory tract, the human alimentary tract is another common site for viral entry. Enteric viruses and even some non-enteric viruses can bypass the physical barriers and infect susceptible cells in the alimentary tract. To date, six human coronaviruses have been identified as the causative agents of mild or severe respiratory infections. The concomitant gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in some human coronaviruses. For example, the human coronavirus OC43, which is closely related to bovine coronavirus phylogenetically, caused gastrointestinal symptoms in up to 57% of the infected patients (37) . Notably, enteric involvement was verified in human infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused a large-scale epidemic with more than 8000 human infections in 2002-2003 (38) . Active SARS-CoV replication was identified in the small and large intestine specimens from colonoscopy biopsy and autopsy (39) . A significant portion of SARS patients had gastrointestinal symptoms; the viral load was the highest in stool specimens, followed by nasopharyngeal aspiration specimens (40) . Thus, the human gastrointestinal tract was speculated to be the primary infection site of SARS-CoV (41), which raised a fearsome concern of dual infectivity of SARS-CoV as being both a respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogen. However, no serious study has been reported to address the important issue. In contrast to the ambiguity of virus acquisition via the alimentary tract in human coronaviruses, it has been known that most animal coronaviruses, such as bovine coronavirus and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, can primarily infect either the enteric or respiratory tract or sometimes translocate between sites (42, 43) . Until now, however, whether human and animal coronaviruses share similarity in terms of a dual acquisition route has remained unanswered. Here, we addressed this long-standing question in human intestinal epithelial cells, intestinal organoids, and hDPP4 transgenic mice. We demonstrate that the human intestinal tract serves as an alternative infection route for MERS-CoV. The knowledge obtained from this study will provide a scientific basis for the implementation of effective intervention/prevention strategies to halt the continuing MERS epidemic.",

Briefly, after permeabilization and blocking, cells, intestinoids, and tissues were stained with a guinea pig antiserum against MERS-CoV NP, followed with secondary antibodies including goat anti-guinea pig Alexa Fluor 488 immunoglobulin G (IgG) or goat anti-guinea pig Alexa Fluor 594 IgG (Abcam). For intestine explants and intestinoids, CK19 (YM3051, ImmunoWay), a marker of intestinal epithelial cell, was costained with an anti-NP antibody. To define the identity of the viral NP-positive cells in the tissues of infected hDPP4 mice, apart from the labeling of MERS-CoV NP, double staining was performed using a rat anti-mouse monoclonal CD68 antibody (FA-11, Abcam) and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rat IgG (Life Technologies). After staining, intestinoids were whole-mounted with VECTASHIELD HardSet Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). The wholemounted intestinoids, chamber slides, Transwell inserts, and tissue slides were imaged using a Carl Zeiss LSM 780 or 800 confocal microscope.",

Active caspase-3 was detected with an Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated rabbit anti-human active caspase-3 antibody (BD Pharmingen). Cell permeabilization for intracellular staining was performed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Immunostaining for flow cytometry was performed following standard procedures (46) . The flow cytometry was performed using the FACSCanto II Analyzer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using FlowJo vX (Tree Star).",

(A) Human primary intestinal cells were inoculated with MERS-CoV (left and middle) or mock-infected (right). At 24 hpi, cells were fixed and applied to immunofluorescence staining of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP). Nuclei were counterstained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue). The images show the representative results of one experiment. (B and C) Normal human small intestine explants were inoculated with MERS-CoV, as described in Materials and Methods. The data show representative results of the experiments independently performed twice. (B) The infected (left and middle) and mock-infected (right) explants were fixed at 20 hpi for immunofluorescence staining of MERS-CoV NP and the enterocyte marker CK19. Syncytia formation can be observed in the infected intestinal epithelium (middle). (C) At the indicated hpi, the explants (Tissue) and Matrigel together with culture medium (Matrigel) were harvested for the quantification of viral load.

(A) At the indicated hpi, intestinoids (Intestinoid), cell-free Matrigel, and culture medium (Matrigel) were harvested for the quantification of viral load with RT-qPCR. Serially diluted MERS-CoV NP plasmids were used to generate a standard curve for the quantification. (B) The absolute viral loads in intestinoids were normalized with GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) mRNA transcripts. (C) The dissolved Matrigel and culture medium were applied to viral titration with plaque assay. Data are means \u00b1 SD of one representative experiment independently repeated three times. (D and E) At 24 hpi, the infected and mock-infected intestinoids were fixed after disassociation and stained with the MERS-CoV NP antiserum and then applied to flow cytometry to evaluate the percentage of NP-positive cells. The histogram shows the results of one representative experiment. (E) Data are means and SD of three independent experiments. Student's t test was used for data analysis. **P \u2264 0.01.
