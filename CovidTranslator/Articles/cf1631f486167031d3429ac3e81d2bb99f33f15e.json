The SARS-CoV N protein has also been suggested to be involved in other important functions in the viral life cycle. Here we show that the N protein consists of two non-interacting structural domains, the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD) (residues 45-181) and the C-terminal dimerization domain (residues 248-365) (DD), surrounded by flexible linkers. The C-terminal domain exists exclusively as a dimer in solution. The flexible linkers are intrinsically disordered and represent potential interaction sites with other protein and protein-RNA partners. Bioinformatics reveal that other coronavirus N proteins could share the same modular organization. This study provides information on the domain structure partition of SARS-CoV N protein and insights into the differing roles of structured and disordered regions in coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins.",

The M protein may also be involved in the formation of the nucleocapsid through interaction with the N protein. Upon infection, the N protein enters the host cell with the ribonucleoprotein core and is able to interact with a number of host proteins [9] . The high abundance of the N protein makes it a major antigen, an attribute which has often been used in the development of rapid-diagnosis kits against SARS [10, 11] .",

From genetic and bioinformatics studies, the N protein can be divided into three putative regions: an Nterminal domain, a RNA-binding domain (RBD) and a C-terminal domain [12, 13] . The N-and Cterminal domains are believed to play a role in interaction with other proteins. A number of recent studies have shown that part of the C-terminus in the N protein of SARS-CoV is involved in the oligomerization process of the protein [14, 15] . Rather surprising, the mid-portion of the protein has been shown to interact with the M protein and hnRNP A1 [16, 17] , and structural studies have identified the region between amino acids 45-181 as the putative RNA-binding region, which is close to the N-terminus [18] . These discrepancies from the putative domain partition necessitate the determination of both the functional and structural organization of the protein. However, the structural organization of coronavirus N proteins in general remains largely unknown to this day.",

Through the power of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we present the first evidence that the SARS-CoV N protein consists of two independent structural domains. The first domain lies inside the putative RNAbinding domain identified in a previous report [18] . The second domain lies in the C-terminal half of the protein and is capable of forming dimers in solution. The rest of the protein is highly accessible to the solvent, and bioinformatics analysis predicts that they are intrinsically disordered. Other coronavirus N proteins share similar features of SARS-CoV N protein at the sequence level, implying functional significance. The elucidation of the modular organization of the SARS-CoV N protein, particularly the boundary between disordered and structured regions, facilitates future studies of this class of proteins at the functional and structural level.",

NMR chemical shifts of amide resonances are sensitive to structural changes and the pattern of 15 N-HSQC spectrum has been commonly used to monitor order-disorder of proteins [30] . Well-dispersed spectra are indicative of structured protein whilst congested spectra having resonances clustered around a small region of 8.3\u00b10.5 ppm in the proton dimension are disordered. We observed that the resonances from residues N45-181 have good chemical shift dispersion (Figure 2a) , indicating that the fragment has a structured character. The spectrum of N1-181 is a superposition of well-dispersed resonances and a cluster of overlapping resonances around 8.3\u00b10.4 ppm (Figure 2b ). Comparing the spectra of N1-181 and N45-181 revealed that all resonances belonging to N45-181 were present in the spectrum of N1-181 with no change in resonance position.

To define the structural boundaries we constructed fragments containing N-and C-terminal extensions. Figure 2d shows the 15 N-HSQC spectrum of uniformly 15 N-labeled N248-422 sample. Comparing the spectrum of N248-422 with that of N248-365 ( Figure 2c ) we found that all resonances due to N248-365 can be identified in Figure 2d . These results indicate that residues from 365 to the C-terminal do not affect the structure of N248-365.

We also observed additional resonances clustered around 8.3\u00b10.5 ppm in the proton dimension whenever the fragment was extended beyond the two structural domains (Figure 2 ). To test whether the residues beyond the structural domains are truly disordered, we employed the CLEANEX-PM experiment to identify solvent-accessible resonances [27] . The 15 N-HSQC spectrum obtained with CLEANEX-PM pulse sequence contains only resonances from solvent-exposed amide groups. When we compared the CLEA-NEX-PM spectrum of N1-181 (Figure 3b) with that of N45-181 (Figure 3a) , we observed 40 resonances that only appeared in N1-181 but not in N45-181. This number agrees with that expected for the N-terminal region (5 prolines), indicating that all amide protons in the Nterminus of SARS-CoV N protein are exposed to the solvent. We counted 39 additional peaks in the CLEANEX-PM spectrum of N248-422 (Figure 3d ) compared to that of N248-365 ( Figure 3c ) (51 expected since there are 6 prolines), suggesting that the majority of the C-terminal residues are also solvent-exposed. When we compared the CLEANEX-PM spectra of N45-181 (Figure 3a) , N248-365 ( Figure 3c ) and N45-365 (Figure 3f) , we observed the extra resonances representing the region between residues 182-247. A total of 27 additional peaks can be resolved, compared to 64 expected (2 prolines), indicating that about half of the linker region between residues 182-247 is exposed to the solvent. It should be noted here that due to resonance overlapping the numbers counted should be viewed as a lower limit for the number of solvent-exposed residues. Nevertheless we can conclude that all N-terminal residues are solvent exposed whilst most of the residues in the Cterminus and in the linker region between the two structural domains are exposed to the solvent as well. In conjunction with the observation that all additional resonances are observed in between 8.3\u00b10.5 ppm in the proton dimension and PONDR results, we conclude that amino acids 1-44, 182-247 and 366-422 are disordered. The long disordered linker between the two structural domains is consistent with the observation that there is little interaction between the two domains. However, the number of counted peaks in the CLEANEX-PM spectra of the Cterminus and the linker region are less than that expected, so it is likely that parts of these regions are solvent-protected, possibly through the formation of transient structures. Attempt to obtain a spectrum of the linker region alone was unsuccessful due to the extremely poor protein expression of the clone harboring the linker sequence.",

The function of the N248-365 is not clear, but many reports have identified the C-terminal half of SARS-CoV N protein to be involved in oligomerization [14, 15] . To test this possibility, we have applied analytical gel-filtration chromatography, chemical cross-linking and analytical ultracentrifugation to assay the self-association property of the N protein fragments. As shown in Figure 4a , N45-181 elutes out at a molecular weight of 18 kDa and N248-365 elutes out as a 28-kDa molecule, suggesting that N45-181 exists as a monomer and N248-365 exists as a dimer. The self-association between the two N248-365 monomers is very strong, since we could not detect any monomeric fraction. Similarly, N45-365 eluted out at molecular weight of $70 kDa, suggesting that N45-365 also exists as a dimer. Furthermore, when N45-181 sample was mixed with N248-365 sample two peaks at 18 and 28 kDa were observed in the elution profile, demonstrating that the two fragments do not interact with each other. Figure 4b detected the presence of only monomer for N45-181 and both monomer and dimer for N248-365.",

Only one major peak was detected for each of these three protein fragments, indicating that they are structurally homogeneous in solution. The results of data analysis with Sedfit version 8.9d showed that protein fragments N45-181, N248-365 and N45-365 sediment at 1.4 S, 2.6 S and 3.7 S (Figure 4c ), corresponding to a molecular mass of 10, 36 and 68 kDa, respectively. These results confirmed that N45-181, N248-365 and N45-365 exist as a monomer, dimer and dimer, respectively, in agreement with the results of gel-filtration chromatography and chemical cross-linking. Taking together all three results indicate that N45-181 exists as a monomer and N248-365 as a dimer. The fact that dimerization occurs through a structural domain strongly suggest that the process is dependent on the structure. A model of the SARS-CoV N protein interaction based on our current results is shown in Figure 4d . It is interesting to note that we did not observe the formation of higher-order multimer in our studies, which may be important for the formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex within the virion. A possible explanation is that multimer formation may require additional factors, such as the presence of RNA or other parts of the N protein that were not present in our samples. Also we can not exclude the possibility that multimers do form at much higher protein concentrations than the ones used in these studies. We suggest that the dimeric form represents a basic building block of the nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV.",

This disordered region may enable transient interactions with several structurally distinct partners. It has been shown that the M protein of SARS-CoV binds to this region between a.a. 168-208 [16] . Interestingly, human cellular hnRNP A1 has also been shown to bind to almost the same region between a.a. 161-210 [17] . The disordered state of this region potentially allows it to interact with different partners depending on context, e.g. with the M protein during virus assembly and with hnRNP A1 during host cell infection. The exact mechanism by which this occurs is not known, but it could involve different induced folding pathways, which has been shown to occur in other disordered proteins [23, 36, 37] .",

Disordered regions represent potential sites for phosphorylation. The flexible linker of SARS-CoV N protein contains an SRrich region, which is targeted by a number of kinases [39] . In fact, this region can be phosphorylated in vitro (Dr. W.-Y. Tarn, personal communication). Recent in silico prediction suggested that most of the potential phosphorylation sites fall in the disordered regions, although the exact phosphorylations sites have not been identified experimentally [38] . Although the exact role of phosphorylation has not been elucidated, it could be related to regulate functions such as RNAbinding and localization within the host cell.",

The large size of the dimeric protein (ca. 90 kDa) also makes full-length structure determination through NMR extremely difficult due to T2 issues. The fact that the two structural domains do not interact provides a handle to solve this problem.

The structures of the N-terminal domains would be of special interest since in SARS-CoV it has been identified as an RNAbinding domain, whereas in other coronaviruses the exact function is not yet known. Of special note is the RNA-binding domain of MHV, which has been mapped to the flexible linker region instead of the N-terminal structural domain. At present the molecular mechanism involving N protein/RNA interaction is still not fully understood and the RNA binding site(s) have not been unequivocally defined. It is possible that the Nterminal structural domain folds into different tertiary structures and plays different roles in different coronavirus N proteins. It is also possible that the linker region may also be involved in RNA binding. Another interesting point that needs further study is the role of the C-terminal structural domain. It is not yet known whether it plays the same dimerization role in other coronavirus as in SARS-CoV, although there are hints in the literature [44] .",
