Compared with NGS, the main features of nanopore sequencing are long sequencing ability, simplicity of use, the fastest turn-around time, high portability and real-time analysis of sequencing data. Though NGS had a longer turnaround time (24 hours), it worked well with different sample types (lung tissue, brain tissue and serum from deceased cases and plasma from a severe case) and was more sensitive than nanopore sequencing. Real-time PCR assays did not reveal any infection by viruses related to bat feces transmission. Pathological detection results showed the presence of spore-like structures, indicating fungus infection in this patient. All the results were consistent with the NGS analysis, supporting the fungus infection.",

NGS is used by IVDC in response to emergency situations [5] [6] [7] . In the present case, the NGS processes in IVDC were conducted on an Ion Torrent PGM with Hi-Q View Kit and 318 v2 chip, and on an Illumina MiniSeq system with Nextera XT Kit and MiniSeq High-output sequencing Kit, and on an MGISEQ 2000. The data were downloaded and analyzed with our in-house Virus Identification Pipeline (VIP). Reads from NGS platforms were analyzed by an advanced version of the VIP [8] . Based on the results of third-generation sequencing (TGS, specifically nanopore sequencing in this study), we used the genome sequence of H. capsulatum as a reference for VIP. Generally, raw NGS reads were first preprocessed by the removal of adapter, low-quality, and lowcomplexity sequences. Next, clean reads were classified at the genus level. This step performed both nucleotide and amino acid homology alignments against a custom database which included the host genome (hg38) and a comprehensive collection of bacteria, fungi, parasite and virus sequences (derived from NT collection, May 2018) by Centrifuge [9] and Kaiju [10] . In addition, all classified reads under a genus were subject to de novo assembly and phylogenetic analysis [11] . The selected high-confidence reads and contigs were rechecked on web BLAST.",

Capsulatum can be found in pathological sections by PAS staining, Gomori hexamine silver staining, and Wright-Giemsa staining, but not by HE staining. The fungus needs to be distinguished from other pathogens such as Penicillium marneffei and Leishmania, which to a great degree depends on the experience of the expert in pathobiology. The positive rate of clinical specimen culture is related to the symptom severity of the disease and the quality of the sample. Detection of Histoplasma antigens targeting the Histoplasma polysaccharide antigen in urine and serum samples can be also used for the diagnosis of this disease, and usually, urinary detection is more sensitive than serum detection. Unfortunately, commercial kits to detect Histoplasma antigens based on enzyme immunoassay are still not available in China. PCR, nested PCR and real-time PCR using Histoplasma specific primers were reported to distinguish cultured Histoplasma from other pathogenic fungi [14] .

A TGS platform (nanopore) was the first to provide evidence that Histoplasma caused this outbreak. In comparison with NGS, the advantages of nanopore sequencing are its ability to record long sequences. In addition, the system is simple to use, fast, high portability, thus, allows it to be used on real-time analysis of sequencing. MinION has been increasingly applied in the fields of virus detection, viral whole-genome sequencing, and viral evolution [19] [20] [21] [22] . NGS was also successfully applied in response to the event described in this paper. Though NGS using MiniSeq and MGI2000 systems worked slower (24 h) than nanopore sequencing (13 h), it fitted well with different sample types and was more sensitive. The sensitivity is closely related to the read numbers by NGS. We obtained read numbers of 228,453,930, 189,759,510 and 236,103,930 from the three samples (BALF, CSF and plasma) obtained from the severe case by, and all of them tested positive for H. capsulatum. In this case, NGS also identified specific fragments of Histoplasma in all tested samples (lung, brain and blood serum) from the deceased patients, which consolidated the identification of Histoplasma as the causative pathogen, indicating higher detection sensitivity by NGS than nanopore sequencing.",
