Here we reveal that translation occurs through successive translocation-and-pause cycles. The distribution of pause lengths, with a median of 2.8 s, indicates that at least two rate-determining processes control each pause. Each translocation step measures three bases-one codon-and occurs in less than 0.1 s. Analysis of the times required for translocation reveals, surprisingly, that there are three substeps in each step. Pause lengths, and thus the overall rate of translation, depend on the secondary structure of the mRNA; the applied force destabilizes secondary structure and decreases pause durations, but does not affect translocation times. Translocation and RNA unwinding are strictly coupled ribosomal functions.",

The ribosome undergoes several dynamical structural changes as it moves relative to the mRNA and transfer RNAs during translation 8,11 . Kinetic experiments have given a quantitative description of some of these dynamics during the main steps of the elongation cycle of protein synthesis 12 . During elongation, the secondary structures present in all mRNAs are disrupted to allow movement of the mRNA through the 30S subunit, and the reading of each codon. This task is aided by the mRNA helicase activity of the ribosome that has been localized to the downstream tunnel of the 30S subunit 13 . Moreover, interactions of mRNA pseudoknots or hairpins with the helicase region of the ribosome can shift the reading frame of the mRNA to the -1 frame, and play an important role in regulating gene expression in retroviruses 14-16 . It is extremely difficult to follow the steps of ribosomes during translational elongation using ensemble methods, because the dynamics of individual ribosomes are stochastic 17,18 and it is impossible to synchronize their activity. Here, we have used optical tweezers to follow the step-by-step translation of a single hairpin-forming mRNA molecule by a single ribosome. This approach has allowed us to characterize the dynamics of ribosome translation, measuring",

One of the beads was held on a micropipette and the other in an optical trap used to measure the changes in distance between the beads (in nanometres) and the forces applied to the hairpin (in piconewtons) (Fig. 1A) 20-22 . Translation is resumed at the singlemolecule level by adding a mixture containing the required aminoacyl-tRNAs. During translation, the ribosome opens the hairpin as it moves through the RNA; thus, each base translocated requires the breaking of a base pair, which corresponds to an increase in the endto-end distance of the mRNA by about 1 nm at the forces involved in these experiments (15-20 pN) 23 . Translation can thus be followed in real time by monitoring these changes in distance.",

The progress of translation was established by determining the size of the residual hairpin, through its mechanical unfolding (details presented in Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). To verify that the change in hairpin size was caused by a stalled ribosome at the corresponding position on the hairpin, we flowed a ribosome-releasing mixture containing puromycin (see Methods) into the reaction chamber. After a few minutes, the hairpin fully refolded, indicating that the ribosome had been released.

The hairpin with a ribosome stalled at the Phe codon was held at a constant force of 20 pN-a force below that required to unfold the hairpin (approximately 23 pN, see Supplementary Fig. 3) , and the extension change was monitored in time. As expected, hairpin unwinding was not observed before a translation mixture was injected into the reaction chamber to resume elongation. The extension and force trajectories versus time obtained in the presence of the translation mixture are shown in Fig. 2a . Strikingly, the extension shows a repeated steppause-step pattern. These patterns display clear and discrete transitions (indicated by arrows). The steps were quantitatively analysed by calculating the corresponding pairwise distance distributions 23 , as shown in Fig. 2b . The distance between steps is 2.7 nm, which corresponds to six nucleotides at 20 pN; that is, the breaking of three hairpin base pairs accompanying a translocation step of three bases. Thus, we identified these transitions as ribosomal steps corresponding to the translation of individual codons. Figure 2c shows a step-pause-step trajectory defining the translocation time, the dwell time (the time between successive steps) and the pause time (the time between translocation events) of one such cycle. Direct analysis of the translocation events (number of events, n = 121) during translation of VE60hp gives a step size of 2.94 \u00b1 0.72 bases occurring in 0.078 \u00b1 0.045 s.",

Figure 3c summarizes the positions of translation arrests in the VE274hp construct (underlying blue bars).

To test the effects of internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences on translation, the first Shine-Dalgarno sequence AG GAG G in VE274hp was changed to AA GAA G; note that the new codons are recognized by the same isotype of tRNA Glu and the amino-acid sequence is maintained. On this mutant hairpin, VE274hp-G2A, the translation arrest downstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (positions 67-75) has now disappeared (underlying red bars, Fig. 3c ). These results suggest that translating ribosomes can be stalled by base pairing between the 3\u2032 end of 16S rRNA and internal Shine-Dalgarno sequences in the mRNA, similar to the interaction during the initiation process. A recent report shows that the Shine-Dalgarno interaction increases the rupture force of the ribosome from the bound mRNA by 10 pN 25 . The arrests observed in the vicinity of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in our experiments indicate that this extra binding energy, together with the downstream hairpin structure, is sufficient to block the movement of the ribosome.",

The long pauses occur less often in the first valine patch (V1) than in succeeding ones ( Supplementary Fig. 6a ). These long pauses can be identified from the derivatives of the individual translation trajectories (that is, the derivatives of the traces in Fig. 3a ; one is shown in Supplementary Fig. 6b ). The valleys between peaks on such plots characterize the long pauses, whereas the peaks on the plot correspond to active translation runs. These peaks show a relatively constant rate of 0.45 \u00b1 0.17 codons per second, corresponding to a mean dwell time of 2.2 s (n = 43 ribosomes); these short pauses, we surmise, represent the constitutive (intrinsic) pauses of a translating ribosome.",

In single-molecule experiments, the distribution of lifetimes for a species depends on the number and rates of the molecular events that transform that species into another. If a single stochastic event determines the lifetime, the distribution of lifetimes follows a single exponential decay from the smallest lifetimes to the longest lifetimes. For two or more successive reactions the distribution has a maximum at intermediate values of the lifetimes (see Supplementary Information) 26,27 . We analysed the dwell times-the times between successive steps-during translation of the first 15 valines in the VE274hp sequence. We found that these times for an actively translating subset of ribosomes (mean dwell time approximately 2 s) are not exponentially distributed. Instead, the data (n = 180) can be fitted well (R 2 = 0.93) to a difference of two exponentials (Fig. 4a) . To ensure that our choice of ribosomes had not biased the results, we also analysed different subsets, and all the ribosomes. A difference of two exponentials was needed to fit each distribution, although the values of the rate constants, k, differed for each distribution. These results indicate that two, or more, successive rate-limiting processes control the dwell times between steps.",

This result indicates that multiple processes with similar kinetics underlie the translocation step of three nucleotides. Until now, no technique has allowed characterization of the dynamics of ribosome stepping to this degree of detail. The kinetic processes we identified here could involve, for example, steps in the unlocking rearrangement of the ribosome 28 ; or it is also possible that the ribosome moves over the length of one codon with three consecutive, equally timed, singlebase substeps. Figure 3a shows that translation dynamics (overall rates, see Supplementary Fig. 7 , and extents of reactions) are different for each ribosome. However, recurrence of Val patches on VE274hp allowed us to investigate, on the same ribosome, the effect of the force applied to the hairpin. Figure 4b shows that the lengths of pauses increase-translation rates decrease-when the force dropped as translation proceeded from Val segment 1 to 4 (V1-V4). The distributions of dwell times show that decreasing the force (16 to 9 pN) decreases the faster rate constant of the two substeps by a factor of three. At lower forces, the energy barrier impeding strand separation increases, resulting in slower translation rates and longer dwell times. This suggests that a paused ribosome could be rescued by raising the force applied on the ends of the hairpin. This is indeed the case, as shown in Fig. 4c , where raising the force from 10 pN to 18 pN caused translation to immediately resume. Similar force-rescued translations were observed in about one-third of the long-paused ribosomes (14 events in 40 trials). Thus, some of the longer pauses observed in these experiments may be accounted for by the mechanical barriers imposed on the ribosome by the secondary structure of the mRNA.",

To introduce primer sequences and functional sites, oligonucleotide B (CCATGGAACAAGCTGAGGAATCAAACGTTCTTC) and oligonucleotide C (CGGCCGCCGCCCTAGGGGCTGGCTTTCGCCAGCCCTTTAGTGAGGGTTAATT) were ligated to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sides, respectively. The ligated products were subjected to PCR (primers: TAGGATccatggAACAAGCTGAGGAATCAAACG and AAGGCCtgtacaAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGCTGG, NcoI and BsrGI sites are shown in lower case, respectively) and then inserted to pVE60hp between NcoI and BsrGI, replacing the existing hairpin sequence. The cloned sequences were dominated by two copies of oligonucleotide A. The oligonucleotide A regions from two clones were subjected to PCR and ligated to make a construct with essentially four copies of oligonucleotide A (called pRC4). To make a hairpin, the oligonucleotide A region of pRC4 was subjected to PCR (primers: GGACATCCTAATtgtacaAACAAGCTGAGGAATCAAACGTTCTTT and GCTTGTTAggtctcCCTAGGGAAACCTAGGGCGGCGGCCGCTCC, BsrGI and BsaI sites are shown in lower case, respectively; the latter creates a cohesive end compatible to AvrII), and inserted to pRC4 between AvrII and BsrGI, downstream of the oligonucleotide A region. Note that the insertion is in an inverted (tail-to-tail) orientation, such that the insert is complementary to the oligonucleotide A region. RNA was synthesized in vitro with these plasmids with T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion). The synthesized RNA was purified by MEGAclear purification kit (Ambion) and stored at -30 \u00b0C.",

The force-extension curves before translation were fitted to a worm-like chain (WLC) model 24 to obtain the basal WLC curve. A series of curves that mimicked the RNA elasticity corresponding to individual translation steps were calculated. This was done by adding six-nucleotide (three base pairs broken) components each time to the preceding WLC curves, starting from the basal WLC curve. This series of WLC curves was used to calculate the extension change for each step during translation with the consideration of gradual force decreasing. The theoretical relation between the number of bases translocated and extension change was well fitted to a double exponential equation. Finally, the fitted parameters were used to convert the experimentally measured extension change to the number of bases translocated. This empirical method worked well. For example, the force-extension curve after translation in Supplementary Fig. 3a (green trace) shows no apparent rips, suggesting that none or little residual hairpin was left. The converted translation trajectory (the blue trace in Fig. 3a) shows that the ribosome was stalled close to the apical loop of the hairpin, consistent with the experimental data.",
