Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread to 37 countries and caused 8424 cases and 919 deaths in 2002-03, while Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) spread to 27 countries, causing 2494 cases and 858 deaths worldwide to date. Precise knowledge of the incubation period is crucial for the prevention and control of these diseases. We have searched PubMed and preprint archives for articles published as of February 22, 2020, which contain information about these diseases by using the key words of \"COVID-19\", \"SARS\", \"MERS\", \"2019-nCoV\", \"coronavirus\", and \"incubation\". We have found 15 studies that estimated the distribution of the incubation period. There are four articles focused on COVID-19, five on MERS, and six on SARS. Most of these studies had limited sample sizes and were potentially influenced by recall bias. The estimates for mean, median, and percentiles of the incubation period from these articles are summarized in Table 1 .",

[3] [4] [5] [6] In Li et al, the first 425 lab-confirmed cases, reported as of January 22, 2020, were included in the study, while only ten cases could be identified with the exact dates of exposure. 3 The distribution of the incubation period was subsequently approximated by fitting a lognormal distribution to these ten data points, resulting in a mean incubation period of 5\u00b72 days (95% CI: 4\u00b71-7\u00b70), and the 95th percentile is 12\u00b75 days. However, given the limited sample size, it is challenging to make a solid inference on the distribution of the incubation period. A different result was reported by Guan et al, based on 291 patients who had clear information regarding the specific date of exposure as of January 29, 2020, stating that the median incubation period was 4\u00b70 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). 4 However, such study of the incubation period can be highly influenced by the individuals' recall bias or interviewers' judgement on the possible dates of exposure rather than the actual dates of exposure that, in turn, might not be accurately monitored and determined, thus leading to a high percentage of error.

However, this method contained two types of sampling biases: (1) with the longer incubation period, the patients who resided at Wuhan but developed symptoms outside Wuhan were easier to be observed and hence lead to an overestimation; (2) if the follow-up time (from infection to the end of the study) is short, only the shorter incubation period would .

Linton et al proposed a similar approach to estimate the incubation period of Backer et al, but corrected the aforementioned second sampling bias. 5, 6 However, the first problem in regard to sampling bias is still an unsolved issue. The estimates of the incubation period from these four studies, together with other results of two other coronavirus disease, SARS and MERS, are listed in Table 1 . To overcome the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel method to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19 by using the well-known renewal theory in probability. 18 Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing abundance of the readily available forward time with a large sample size of 1211. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is a study of the distribution of the incubation period involving the largest number of samples to date. We find the estimated median of the incubation period is 8\u00b713 days (95% CI: 7\u00b737-8\u00b791), and mean is 8\u00b762 days (95% CI: 8\u00b702-9\u00b728), the 90th percentile is 14\u00b765 days (95% CI: 14\u00b700-15\u00b726), and the 99th percentile is 20\u00b759",

Assuming that these cases were infected before their departure from Wuhan, the time differences between departure and symptoms onset is the censored observations of their incubation periods. Hence, we conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by assuming to catch those asymptomatic individuals at their departure time and followed them until their symptoms developed. Using the language of renewal processes, we can treat the development of the disease starting from infection by a pathogen as a stochastic process that could be observed from a specific time point in chronological order. In this study, the specific time point refers to the time of departure from Wuhan. For each prevalent case, the complete process from the infection to the onset of symptoms can be considered as a renewal process. As illustrated in Figure 1 , the backward recurrence time is hence defined as the time between infection and departure from Wuhan, and the forward recurrence time is the time between departure from Wuhan and symptom onset. Clearly, the forward time is observable and the corresponding observations are with good veracity, while the backward time is either unable to be observed or the corresponding observations are with large uncertainty due to recall bias. Note that for each infected individual, the backward time and forward time do not have to be same. However, when the renewal process reaches its equilibrium status, it becomes reversible, that is, the statistical properties of this process is the same as the one for time-reversed data in a same process. Hence, at equilibrium, the backward time can be treated as the forward time if time periods are reversed. 19 In order to model incubation using the renewal process properly, the following assumptions are established:",

Its application includes decisions regarding the length of quarantine for prevention and control, dynamic models that accurately predict the disease process, and determining the contaminated source in foodborne outbreaks. In this paper, we propose a novel method to estimate the incubation distribution which only requires information on travel histories and dates of symptoms onset. This method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing abundance of the readily available forward time data. In addition, this is the first article to consider the incubation period for COVID-19 virus as a renewal process which is a well-studied methodology and has a solid theoretical foundation. The estimated incubation period has a median of 8\u00b713 days (95% CI: 7\u00b737-8\u00b791), a mean of 8\u00b762 days (95% CI: 8\u00b702-9\u00b728), the 90th percentile is 14\u00b765 days (95% CI: 14\u00b700-15\u00b726), and the 99th percentile is 20\u00b759 days (95% CI: 19\u00b747-21\u00b762). Compared with the results published in Li et al, Guan et al, Backer et al, and Linton et al, the incubation period estimated in our study is significantly longer. 3-6 Below is some evidence that may potentially support our findings of the long incubation period: 1. In the study of Guan et al on behalf of China Medical Treatment Expert Group for COVID-19,the incubation period had a reported median of 4 days, the first quartile of 2 days and the third quartile of 7 days.4 By fitting a commonly used Weibull distribution to such quartiles, we can defined in Equation(2). As a consequence, the estimated 90%, 95% and 99% percentiles are, respectively, 10\u00b754, 13\u00b704 and 18\u00b745 days, which indicates that some patients may have extended incubation periods.2. One particular case reported by Yinbin municipal health commissions in China stated that a 64-year-old female was diagnosed with COVID-19 on February 11, 2020 at Yinbin, Sichuan province 20 days after returning from Wuhan. This patient was under self-quarantine at home with the family for 18 days, from January 23 to February 9. On February 8, the patient developed mild symptoms of cough with sputum production. 21 .
