We evaluated whether postmortem blood and bloodstains containing hepatitis B virus (HBV) are infectious. HBV-infected blood and bloodstains were stored for up to 60 days at room temperature and subsequently screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV DNA. In addition, HBV-positive postmortem blood was added to a cell line and the production of HBV virions was examined over a period of 7 days. HBsAg and HBV DNA were detected in all samples stored for 60 days at room temperature. HBV-positive postmortem blood successfully infected the cell line and progeny viruses were produced for up to 6 days. Thus, it is crucial that due care is taken when handling not only living material infected with HBV, as well as other harmful viruses, but also blood or body fluids from cadavers or medical waste.",

In addition, if the virus capsid is intact, it is still unclear whether this virus is still infectious. HCV is very difficult to culture in cells in vitro, and culturing of HCV isolates directly from patient sera is as yet unattainable [4] . Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a partially double-stranded, enveloped DNA virus classified within the Hepadnaviridae as well as a member of the hepatitis virus grouping with HCV. Despite the availability of a vaccine HBV infection is still a global health problem, since over 240 million people are estimated to be chronically infected by HBV [5, 6] and more than 300,000 die annually from cancer or liver dysfunction associated with HBV infection [7] . HBV can be grown easily in cell culture [8, 9] . Therefore, in this study, we selected HBV as a representative 'harmful virus' for analysis. We stored HBV-infected blood and bloodstains for up to 60 days at room temperature and examined if HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) could be detected. In addition, HBV-infected postmortem blood was added to a cell line and we examined if this HBV-infected cell line could produce progeny virus.",

Approximately 75% of HBVrelated transmissions in healthcare workers are via percutaneous injury with a scalpel or needle; the remaining mode of transmission in these workers is via mucosal-cutaneous exposure. When an individual is positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg, there is a 22-31% risk of hepatitis [15] . Even in a high-risk working environment, medical workers have existing knowledge about infectious diseases and the appropriate use of guards such as gloves and masks. However, there is a higher risk of infection (and becoming Anti-HBcpositive) when non-medical workers, who lack this medical expertise, attend a disaster. The risk of HBV infection has been reduced by universal vaccination in several countries [16, 17] , however the infection risk, not only in the medical field but also in the general population remains high, therefore it is advisable to extend universal vaccination to the rest of the world.",

            "text": "In this study, although it was only with a single case, HBV in postmortem blood successfully infected the HepG2 cell line (Table 3) . HepG2 cells are a human hepatoblastoma cell line derived from a 15-year-old male with a well-differentiated carcinoma. HepG2 cells differ morphologically from primary hepatocytes. Recently, the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) was identified as a receptor for HBV [18] ; however, it is not expressed in HepG2 cells [19] . However, some reports have described binding and entry of HBV using normal HepG2 cells; furthermore, although virion production was not observed in these studies [20] [21] [22] [23] , it was following transfection of HBV DNA in related studies [8, 9] . It is therefore possible that the mechanisms of viral entry into HepG2 cells or hepatocytes has not been clearly elucidated. In our case study, we used normal HepG2 cells to observe the infection of HBV even though it is much easier to infect cells with HBV following NTCP expression. Even in these challenging conditions without NTCP expression, HBsAg and HBV DNA were detected in cultured cells. This finding does not conclude directly that HBV in postmortem materials remains infectious to humans, for instance it may be due to residual HBV in the culture dish. However, at least we can say that there is a possibility of infection.",
