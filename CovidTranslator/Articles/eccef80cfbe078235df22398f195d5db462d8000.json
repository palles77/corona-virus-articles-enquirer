The method is applied to simulations of a foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak to demonstrate how the combination of both phylogenetic and epidemiology data can be used to strengthen the assessment of the likelihood of direct transmission over methods using just phylogenetic data or infection timing data alone. The method is applied to a previous FMD outbreak to identify areas where over confidence in previously inferred direct transmission may exist. Conclusion: Combining knowledge from viral evolution and epidemiology within a single integrated transmission inference framework is an important approach to assess the potential likelihood of transmission events and makes clear how specific features of a virus' spread through the course of an outbreak will directly determine the potential for confidence in inferred host transmission links. Background Developing methods to protect against RNA virus outbreaks in the face of constantly changing disease dynamics remains one of the great public health challenges of our time. One small piece of this problem involves determining the host-pathogen transmission history to identify an outbreak's origin. In recent cases such as the 2003 SARS outbreak [1, 2], H5N1 influenza [3] infection in humans and Marburgvirus [4], phylogenetic inference has been used to help identify potential outbreak sources. Typically, a collection of sequences from candidate related sources are compared to infer transmission links between the most closely related sequences. These methods have been used beyond the public health domain to provide evidence in HIV [5, 6] and other forensic investigations [7] to help infer when a suspect is involved in infecting a victim. P (\u03b4, \u03c3|M ) rather than P (\u03b4|M ). This reflects the desire to estimate the probability of observing the genetic relation \u03b4 in conjunction with infection related timing values for the transmission hypothesis M . The \u03c3 parameter values are motivated by a SEIR type infection concept [22], which describes a host in one of four 5 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a",

            "text": "Complementary to the viral genome sequencing advances is contact tracing work to find host to host transmission patterns independent of molecular genetic sequence data [10] [11] [12] [13] . Previously a transmission inference framework was described that estimates the probability of viral transmission between two hosts using both viral sequence samples and contact tracing data [14, 15] . The method uses labeled training sets from past outbreaks to correlate models of viral evolution associated with direct transmission and indirect transmission to assign a posterior probability that gives a confidence value for inferring a transmission relationship between two infected hosts. One of the limitations of the approach is the need for a robust training set, which can limit application to novel outbreaks. Even when training data is available, a training set over-represented with local outbreak features could skew confidence values. Thus, there is a need to develop additional tools to mitigate limits introduced from training. One feature that can be difficult to accurately account for with limited exemplars is time series data. The objective of this article is to present an approach to incorporate time series data with molecular genetic sequence data to measure the uncertainty of host to host transmission events in the face of limited training data and variability in host infection times. Efforts to integrate models of epidemiology and genetic evolution have been ongoing for some time [16] [17] [18] [19] , yet less work has focused on the specific problem of measuring the certainty of inferring individual host transmission events. One related effort is a method called SeqTrack, which was used to examine the origins of the 2009 H1N1 outbreak [20] . This work is similar to our previous transmission inference [14] approach with a few key differences. Rather than inferring a host transmission graph, a genealogy tree is inferred where nodes represent sequence samples and edges between nodes link a sequence to putative descendants. Sample collection times exclude some candidate edges and edge weights represent genetic distances between two sequences. The genealogy tree is inferred by finding the directed graph analog of the minimum spanning tree. Given the elapsed time between two sequences and a per day mutation rate, a confidence value is assigned for direct genealogy linkages. The framework presented here is a more general framework where variable within host evolution times are assumed to play a role. A second closely related effort is the work to recover transmission links between farms applied to the 2001 FMD outbreak [21] .",

Data from that study is used here and a comparison with this work will be covered in detail later in the paper. While the Cottam et al. approach evaluates a putative outbreak tree overlaid onto a single phylogenetic tree, our main contribution is to provide a framework that models features of transmission inference not previously considered. In particular, uncertainty in transmission inference is newly captured by explicitly considering unobserved nodes in the outbreak tree and uncertainty of phylogeny through the use of multiple potentially competing phylogenetic inferences. The result is a more realistic measure of uncertainty when assigning a transmission link. The framework's added use of competing transmission hypotheses does, however, come with an increased computational cost. The remainder of the paper details the modifications to our original framework, shows how new information is used in simulations and real data, details important differences with the Cottam et al. approach and introduces a way for dealing with limitations introduced by the framework's increased computational cost.",

The SEIR model describes outbreak dynamics in a homogeneous mixing population and since the focus of the framework is to predict individual host to host transmission relationships a pre-determined outbreak tree is used, which excludes hosts in the susceptible state. Figure 2 shows the graphical representation of two infected hosts A and B linked by a direct transmission event. Each circle represents a discrete time point marking the transition between states or time intervals. Transmission time points marked red in Figure 2 denote the time of transmission from Host A to Host B. Sample time points marked in purple represent times when viral samples are collected for sequencing. The representation is analogous to a phylogenetic tree where branches (or tree edges) represent time intervals and nodes represent fixed time points. Here edges or transmission events between infected nodes represent instantaneous time events and the host nodes represent time intervals defined by a linear chain of discrete events. The motivation for this representation is to employ a sufficiently realistic epidemiology model to describe the transmission relationships of interest and use existing methods for modeling viral evolution by mapping them to the epidemiology model.",

An average incubation time of 5 days is assumed with a variation between 2 and 14 days determined by a gamma distribution. The infectious time interval varied from 1 to 10 days drawn from a distribution model on previously described time intervals given by [21] . The objective was to evaluate the impact of combining the genetic data with timing information and apply the evaluation methods to the original 2001 UK FMD outbreak data to assess the confidence of the associated transmission links predicted using similar evidence but using the new inference approach.

Thus, the false positive rate reflects the fact that roughly 3% of node pairs that are not linked have a timing pattern consistent with the potential for direct transmission. These pairs likely refer to \"siblings\" or other nodes that are close by in the tree. This provides a baseline measure for quantifying the difficulty of the inference problem and shows that when exact timing knowledge is available the possible transmission inferences become highly constrained. The MRCAT-Only line shows the other end of the spectrum where there are no explicit timing constraints to prevent inference of direct transmission. The plot shows that a low confidence threshold is required to correctly identify all true direct transmission links, which shows that there is a wide overlap between the genetic distance range for both direct and indirectly linked hosts.",

Longer incubation times open more plausible phylogenetic scenarios where two hosts are falsely linked by direct transmission but are actually linked by a shared infectious source. One potential way to strengthen inference could be to collect more sequences per farm spread over multiple time points, which in some situations may reduce the range of most likely most recent common ancestor times.

The algorithm starts at the leaves of the parsimony tree and assigns the inferred common ancestor nodes to one of the farms (with a descendant leaf) as the putative source. All possible tree labellings are evaluated using an infection time likelihood score, which similar to our approach estimates likely infection times based on estimated incubation and infectious duration times. Several important differences between the two approaches emerge after examining the differences in output. One difference is that our method incorporates putative unobserved farms into transmission hypothesis tests, which help prevent over confidence in certain transmission inferences. As will be discussed in the next section, this can also form the basis for supporting a more flexible framework for evaluating more sparsely sampled outbreaks.

Integrating phylogenetic data with infection timing data to infer more distant transmission linkages, however, is expected to be considerably more difficult.

This is not a limitation of the method but a limitation of exploitable transmission inference knowledge.

The second random sampling step is in the tree traversal procedure illustrated in Figure 5 , which is designed to determine whether there is a sequence of timing events for a particular transmission chain and a given collection of infection time durations that is consistent with the inferred most recent common ancestor time. Rather than an exhaustive search, a fixed number of random trials are taken. This approach is thus biased against inferring links requiring rarely occurring timing intervals that would be required to support the most recent common ancestor time.

For clarity the two figures are used to separate the distributions into two classes, those with peaks at M \u22645 and those that peak at M > 5. (Note that the maximal path length observed was 37, however, due to the 2,000 tree node limit, longer path lengths occur less frequently in the 40 trial experiment and thus path lengths with less than 40 observations are not shown.) The results show that the framework assigns a likelihood score that roughly reflects the true underlying path length. In particular, all path lengths less than 10 clearly peak at M=1 or M=5 in the figure. The results do suggest room for improvement, however, since path lengths for M=11-17 still show their maximum likelihood value at M=5. A possible reason for this is that for longer transmission chains the space of inconsistent infection times may expand at a rate that is not proportional to the increase in the number consistent infection times. Since the method uses a fixed random sample size this would favor shorter more constrained transmission hypotheses. Nevertheless, even where the likelihood value peaks at M=5, for longer transmission chains the likelihood values for M > 5 come increasingly closer to the peak until there is finally a peak shift at path length 19 from M=5 to M=10. It is interesting to note that as the path length increases, the peak likelihood value decreases quantifying the increasing ambiguity associated with making long transmission chain inferences. Despite this difficulty, the results indicate that in many cases it may be possible to assign a transmission relationship using a more inclusive class of transmission chain lengths. For example, nodes linked by a transmission path length less than 10 appear to be fairly distinct from those separated by path lengths greater than 20. These distinctions could prove to be of critical importance, particularly when evaluated in the context of an underlying contact network.",

Moreover, there are other potentially useful epidemiological models that could be substituted for the SEIR approach presented here [30] . Another important area of development is the use of sequence data and a coalescent model to estimate epidemiological parameters. Recent work demonstrates the potential to estimate parameters for a SIR model from genetic sequence data [31] , which could provide an important basis for specifying the epidemiological parameters for transmission inference, when limited non-genome sequence derived observation is available. A strength of the approach is to provide a framework that can readily make use of increasing amounts of knowledge for a particular outbreak. For example, awareness of infections may increase during the course of an outbreak and thus favor using two different priors for the infectious duration times, one at an early outbreak stage and another at a later stage of the outbreak. Other clinical features of infection can be taken into account either by changing prior likelihoods for alternatives in the underlying outbreak tree structure or by making adjustment to priors in the timing distributions. In some cases prior knowledge could be used to narrow the window of possible infection times and greatly strengthen the confidence of transmission inference. In other cases prior knowledge may end up increasing the window of possible infection times and thus highlight the inherent complexity of reconstructing transmission events.",

The figure shows two simple trees, T 0 and T 1 (left and right tree respectively) where the infected hosts are overlaid as circles on the trees to show the transmission event from host X 0 to X 1 in T 0 and Y 0 to Y 1 in T 1 . The larger circle for Y 1 represents a longer infection time and the two trees represent the evolutionary relationship between the sequences. Assuming comparable homogeneous nucleotide substitution rates, the longer branch length in T 1 could be explained by the longer infection time in host Y 1 prior to sampling. Including the direct transmission branch lengths from T 0 and T 1 in a single genetic based transmission inference model leads to a distribution of genetic distances associated with direct transmission for a wider range of values. Thus, estimating accurate confidence values means ensuring that a representative sampling from the true distribution of infection times can be obtained. To measure the impact of this problem, a new method is introduced to incorporate variation in infection times when assigning a final posterior probability confidence value. The proposed method forgoes the use of training data by relying on prior knowledge of viral infection times to act as a constraint in conjunction with phylogenetic data. The results show that with knowledge of infection times confidence in transmission inference can be high and even with limited knowledge of timing patterns, high confidence values can be obtained that exceed the training based methods. Thus, this new transmission inference approach allows for the use of clinical observations of infection to be combined with inferred viral evolution when training data is not available to measure uncertainty associated with specific transmission hypotheses.",

The directed edges labeled in blue show the path lengths connecting the selected nodes with the path length labels from 1 to the maximum observed (23) for this particular outbreak tree. The tree infers evolutionary relationships that are generally consistent with what would be expected given the different transmission chain lengths observed. For example, a path length of 23 separates node 628 from 1740 and indeed the two nodes end up in two different subclades of the tree. The key question becomes can additional information be obtained by incorporating knowledge of infection times and alternative transmission hypothesis testing with the phylogenetic data to better capture the range of possible relationships among the infected farms. To answer this, we first show the likelihood evaluation for the node pairs taken from the tree in Figure 13 and then show the same likelihood evaluations averaged across all Likelihood values are given for the 12 selected transmission pairs shown in Figure 13. Each node pair is evaluated for different values of M from 1 to 35 and the true path length for each node pair is shown in the legend. randomized outbreak trials. To limit computational costs, evaluated path lengths start with 1 and 5 and continue in intervals of 5 up to 35. The likelihood value P (\u03b4|M ) is reported as the maximal likelihood value for all alternative sub trees of path length M. Figure 14 shows the value of P (\u03b4|M ) for each pair of nodes with node pairs labeled by their true transmission path length. For the sampled outbreak shown in Figure 13, with the exception of M=11, node pairs for path lengths up to 15 show P (\u03b4|M ) values that favor a specific hypothesis or a small subset of hypotheses. As the true path length increases, the average likelihood value drops and the distinction between different path lengths becomes less clear. For the node pair separated by path length of 15 for example, there are clearly higher values for inferring a path length from between 5 and 20, but there is limited distinction within this range. For the most part the framework largely reinforces what is visualized using the consensus phylogenetic tree. An interesting case, however, is the node pair (1255, 1888) linked by a transmission chain of 9, compared with node pair (713, 1119)separated by chain length 13. In the framework, both pairs of nodes have likelihood values that peak at M=5, however the alternative transmission hypotheses for linking (713, 1119) with M=10 or M=15 are much higher than they are for the (1255, 1881) case. This is an example where the relationships inferred by the tree may be misconstrued without the explicit use of a transmission inference framework. It is important to note that the transmission framework does not resolve all conflicts. For the M=11 case",

Simulations of an FMD outbreak show how the combined use of the epidemiology based timing constraints with the phylogenetic inferred most recent common ancestor times improve confidence in transmission inference over methods that rely on just one individual feature. The simulations show that labeled training data measuring genetic distance between direct and indirect transmission cases can be used without the additional knowledge of the features of the viral transmission, however, appropriate training data in some cases may not be available. The approach presented is expected to provide a basis for building flexible tools to more readily map inferred viral evolutionary relationships onto epidemiological models to more accurately quantify host transmission relationships.
