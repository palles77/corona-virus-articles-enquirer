We have also shown that in this sample, like in prior studies, AA patients were less likely than white patients to consider TKR as a treatment option. Our study is also the first to show that structural social support, measured by marital status, and functional support appear to be important determinants of preference for TKR in white patients, but not African-American patients. Finally, our study demonstrates a significant race and gender interaction in willingness to undergo TKR.",

This racial/ ethnic disparity in measures of structural and functional support has also been observed in other study populations (14, (16) (17) (18) . Among younger adults in the general population, African-Americans were found to be less likely to receive social support, more likely to have smaller social networks and more likely to have support come from family members than whites (14, 18) . Indeed, finding that AA patients with OA have weaker support systems than white OA patients has important implications. Low social support has been related to greater symptoms from depression in patients with OA (34) . Conversely, greater support has been related to lower depressive symptoms, greater life satisfaction and more enhanced healthrelated quality of life measures in OA (35, 36) . Social support also moderates the effects of pain and functional limitation due to OA (36) . Clinical trials have, indeed, shown that support groups for OA patients improve health and limit health care costs (37, 38) . In addition, spousal support has been found to predict better improvement in knee limitations following TKR (39) . The perceived adequacy of assistance from others has also been significantly associated with WOMAC function months after joint replacement (40) .",

These results seem to indicate that decreased social support is not an important determinant for TKR decision-making among AA patients. In contrast, our study demonstrates that structural and functional social support were important determinants in white patients' decisions regarding TKR. Moreover, neither depression nor physical health seems to mediate this racial difference in willingness to under TKR. These findings support the idea that other socio-cultural beliefs and attitudes impact treatment preferences among different racial groups. In previous studies, we and others found that racial/ethnic variations in willingness to undergo total knee/hip joint replacement may also be largely attributed to varying expectations in procedure benefit and outcome, different perceptions of usefulness of self-care methods such as prayer and different levels of trust in the medical provider (5-7).",

In fact, we found that our study cohort's sociodemographic profile is similar to that of US Census Bureau participants living in Allegheny County, PA and a comparable cohort of knee OA patients recruited in another study (Supplement 3). Second, subjects volunteered for our study. Patients with less social support may not have the time and energy to participate in our study. Therefore, the measured relationship between social support and willingness to undergo TKR may be underestimated. Lastly, our study may be subject to residual confounding. Not all potential confounding variables that may affect the association between race/gender and willingness to undergo TKR were assessed.

There is also a significant race and gender interaction in patient preferences for TKR surgery. Social support does not seem to mediate the gender difference in willingness to consider TKR. On the other hand, social support impacts patient preferences for TKR surgery among Whites, but not among African-Americans. Future studies should evaluate the specific aspects of social support that could be targeted for intervention in the national effort to reduce or eliminate disparities in access and utilization of TKR in the management of end-stage OA.",
