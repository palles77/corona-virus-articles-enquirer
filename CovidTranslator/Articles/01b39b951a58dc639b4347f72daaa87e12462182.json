            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the first coronavirus described, was initially associated with severe respiratory disease. However, outbreaks have more recently also been associated with nephropathogenesis. Topographically interrelated antigenic determinants of the nephropathogenic Gray strain of IBV were characterized using eleven monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Four MAbs (IgG 2a~c) defined epitopes that were both conformation-independent and group specific, reacting with Gray, Arkansas (Ark), and Massachusetts41 (Mass41) strains. Seven MAbs (IgG 1~:) defined conformation-dependent epitopes that could differentiate the Gray from the Ark and Mass strains. The spike protein specificity of the MAbs was determined with the conformation-independent MAbs and one MAb that reacted only in \"non-denaturing\" western blot assays. Competitive binding studies using these MAbs suggested a high degree of functional dependency among the associated epitopes as might be expected with a protein of complex secondary and tertiary structure. At least two regions associated with complete protection of infected embryos were identified that consisted of both conformation-dependent and independent epitopes. However, a \"non-neutralizing\" MAb, which did not protect the embryo from gross lesions, did inhibit virus-induced lesions and replication in the kidneys. These MAbs should be valuable tools in studying IBV pathogenesis.",

Certain strains, such as Gray, Holte, Australian T, and many recent field isolates have been associated with kidney lesions [6, 7, 13, 31, 33] . Correlations between serotype and pathotype have been reported. For example, the Gray strain is known to cause kidney lesions and seems to have reduced tropism for the trachea and lungs, whereas the Arkansas strain is associated with severe respiratory disease and not implicated with nephropathogensis ([7, 13-I, pers. obs.). Defining the factors which predispose certain strains to cause nephropathogenesis effects is critical to the understanding of the mechanisms of IBV pathogenesis. However, studies have not been reported correlating the pathotype of IBV with antigenic or molecular determinants although neurovirulence has been mapped to specific epitopes on the spike protein of mouse hepatitis virus, MHV [10, 30, 32] .",

Virus was collected, purified, and concentrated as previously described [-28] . BALB/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) with 50 gg of purified IBV in an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. The mice were boosted s.c. four weeks later with the same dose of IBV mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Two weeks after receiving the second inoculation, the mice were bled, and the sera were tested with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the production of antibodies directed against the Gray strain of IBV. Mice producing antibodies specific for the Gray strain of IBV after the second inoculation were rested for two additional weeks before inoculating them, intravenously, with 20 pg of solubilized IBV. Three days later, the mice were sacrificed, and the spleens harvested. Fusion of the spleen cells with the Sp 2/OAg 14 myeloma cells, cloning and ascites production have been described previously [8, 11, 18, 19, 34] except that macrophages were replaced by supernatants of cultured RAW 264 cells [26] . Hybridoma supernatants were screened using the ELISA, and the hybridomas were twice cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well microtiter plates. Hybridomas were expanded either in serum defined medium, KC 2000 (Hazelton Biologics, Inc., Lenexa, KS, U.S.A.) or mouse ascites [11] . The supernatants and ascites were collected, and enriched and concentrated with a MAb Trap G affinity column as described by the manufacturer's manual (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Piscataway, NJ, U.S.A.).

The various types of interactions exemplified in Figs. 4A-C were highly reproducible in multiple experiments. The percentage of competition reached a plateau as the concentration of inhibitor was increased. All autologous competitions resulted in 55 to 65% competition or inhibition of binding of labeled MAbs (Figs. 4 A-C). Likewise, a heterologous MAb that could inhibit between 55 and 65% binding of the autologous MAb was considered a strong competitor (Figs.4A, B) . For example, 5C5B4, 5C5B7, 5C5B5, and 9B1B8 competed to an equivalent extent as unlabeled 5C5D 11 with the HRPO-labeled 5C5D 11; therefore, these MAbs were considered to overlap with 5C5D11, such that they appear to share or closely interact with the same epitope. Moderate competition with 35 to 55% inhibition with unlabeled MAb was also observed as seen with the interactions of MAbs 5C5A5 and 5C5A7 with 5C5Dll (Fig.4A ). Competitive inhibition that was less than 35% and considered as non-competiting is illustrated with the interaction of 9B 1 B8 with HRPO-labeled 3C7B8 (Fig. 4 C) . Therefore, the epitopes corresponding to 9B1B8 and 3C7B8 appeared to be functionally non-overlapping or unrelated. Enhancement of inhibition in which the heterologous MAb actually inhibited the reaction to a greater extent than the 65% observed with the autologous MAb was found in several one-way interactions. The interaction of HRPO-labeled 5C5D 11 with unlabeled 9B 1B6 and 5C5B5 resulted in such enhancement over the autologous inhibition (Fig. 4 B) .",

This linear distribution of the two-way competitions for each pair of MAbs identified six overlapping antigenic domains (Table 4 ). Because a number of competitions were observed outside these arbitrary domains, it was concluded that a linear representation could not adequately accommodate these interactions. One MAb, 9B 1B6, competed in reciprocal assays with all MAbs except 9B1B8 and in one direction with this MAb. According to the distribution shown in Table 4 , the six neutralizing MAbs were placed in two relatively distinct loci. Each locus contained both conformation-independent and dependent neutralization associated epitopes. The epitope identified by 5C5C9 that differentiated between vitally induced external lesions, and kidney and lung infection was located in a region lying between the two neutralizing loci, as was the epitope defined by the non-neutralizing 9B1B6, the most broadly reactive MAb.

Therefore, these topographically interacting determinants could, in fact, physically map to distant sites on the same or possibly even different molecules, that is S 1 and S 2.

It was of interest that viral antigen was also observed in the lungs of Gray infected embryos in the absence of any gross, virally induced pathology in these organs. Although the Gray strain reproducibly causes severe kidney lesions in the chicken embryo, 5C5C9 protected the kidneys from lesions and viral infection. In addition, the same MAb inhibited viral antigen expression in the lungs. The non-neutralizing MAb, 9B 1B6, which shares an antigenic domain with 5C5C9, was also found to protect the embryo from virally induced kidney lesions. These MAbs may be identifying distinct, critical functions that the S protein complex plays in viral infection. Their corresponding epitopes could be associated with factors that differentiate tissue tropism. ,Alternatively, the selective protection of internal organs, may be the consequence of indirect inhibition of virus replication resulting from antigenantibody interactions rather than the specific interaction of the MAbs with critical epitopes. With either explanation, these MAbs will be functionally useful in studying IBV-mediated pathogenesis.",
