After five rounds of biopanning, five phage clones showed specific binding affinities to rpAPN-C. In 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays, the phage clone PM1, which contained the HDAISWTHYHPW peptide sequence, had a protective effect against TGEV infection in swine testis cells.

            "text": "T ransmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a highly contagious, enteric disease of swine caused by the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and death, with a mortality rate of up to 100% in seronegative suckling piglets. (1) Presently, TGEV infection continues to cause frequent occurrences of diarrhea in piglets in many countries and markedly so in China. (2, 3) Porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) is reportedly a cellular receptor for TGEV entry (4) and a type II transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to membrane-bound metallopeptidase family, composed of 963 amino acids with a molecular weight of 150 kDa. (5) pAPN shows high expression levels on the surface of porcine intestinal epithelial cells, where it digests peptides at the N-terminus by the putative catalytic site HexxH (aa 383-387). (6, 7) Some pAPN molecules on the brush border membrane of enterocytes are cleaved into B subunits (aa 1-572, 95 kDa) and C subunits (aa 573-963, 50 kDa) by trypsin. (8) The pAPN virus binding sites are mainly located in the C subunit (pAPN-C). (5, 9, 10) Recent reports have described antiserum and phages that displayed peptides with potential antiviral effects against TGEV infection in vitro. (9, 11, 12) Therefore, these properties suggest that pAPN may be a potential candidate for antiviral design and development. In the present study, phages displaying peptides against rpAPN-C protein were screened using a Ph.D.-12 phage library, and further antiviral effect of the identified phage clones was evaluated using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The aim of this study was to explore small molecular therapeutic drugs based on the pAPN-C sequence to treat TGEV infections.",

The Ph.D.-12 phage display library is widely used to identify small molecules for diagnosis and therapy. (12, 18, 19) In the present study, five highaffinity phage clones against the rpAPN-C protein were identified using the Ph.D.-12 phage display library. The results demonstrated that the Ph.D.-12 phage display library was useful to screen the ligands binding to the targets of interest. However, the five identified phage clones only displayed two different peptides and attempts to obtain more phage clones displaying different peptides were unsuccessful in our study. Our results regarding the numbers of identified phage clones were similar with previous observations. (12, 18, 19) The MTT assay indicated that the HDAISWTHYHPW sequence of the PM1 phage clone provided a protective effect to ST cells against TGEV infection. The specific peptide sequence HDAISWTHYHPW has a potential use for treatment of TGEV infection, especially in combination with other special small molecules, such as the SVVPSKATWGFA, HVTTTFAPPPPR, and FKPSSPPSITLW peptides described by Ren and colleagues. (12) Compared to normal ST control cells, the PM1 and PM4 phage clones had no effect on ST cell growth. This result suggested that the recombinant phages displaying specific peptides could be directly used for therapeutic purposes, in place of expensive peptide synthesis.",
