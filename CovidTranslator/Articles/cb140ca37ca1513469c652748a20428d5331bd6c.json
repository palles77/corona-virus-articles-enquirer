            "text": "Patients with severe burn injuries are extremely susceptible to infection, and the host's antibacterial responses are frequently suppressed by alternatively activated macrophages (M2Mf), commonly demonstrated in these patients. An immunosuppressive subset of neutrophils (PMN-II), demonstrated in the peripheral blood of thermally injured patients, has been described as an inducer of M2Mf. In the present studies, the inhibitory effect of glycyrrhizin (GL) on M2Mf generation stimulated by PMN-II was examined. M2Mf were generated from resident Mf (R-Mf, lower chamber) after cultivation with PMN-II (upper chamber) in a dual-chamber transwell. However, M2Mf were not generated from R-Mf when the same transwell cultures were performed in the presence of GL. M2Mf were not generated from R-Mf after cultivation with PMN-II previously treated with GL, while R-Mf previously treated with GL converted to M2Mf after they were cultured with PMN-II in transwells. Interleukin-10 and CCL2 released from PMN-II were shown to be effector molecules responsible for the generation of M2Mf. However, these soluble factors were not produced by PMN-II treated with GL. These results indicate that GL inhibits PMN-II-stimulated M2Mf generation through the inhibition of CCL2/interleukin-10 production by PMN-II.",

            "text": "The majority of deaths in thermally injured patients are associated with infection rather than the physical damage to the skin or the resulting abnormal metabolism [1e4] . As compared with healthy individuals, thermally injured patients have an increased susceptibility to infection because of burn-associated defects in their antibacterial responses [5] . Macrophages (Mf) are one of the critical effector cells in antibacterial innate immune responses [6] . After certain stimulations, resident Mf (R-Mf, Mf isolated from healthy individuals) convert into two different populations: classically activated Mf (M1Mf) and alternatively activated Mf (M2Mf) [7, 8] . M1Mf exhibit the ability to (i) kill infected cells, (ii) express inducible nitric oxide synthase, and (iii) secrete nitric oxide, pro-inflammatory cytokines and Th1 response-associated cytokines [8] . In contrast, M2Mf are commonly found in patients with severe infections, malignancies, thermal injuries, or after major surgery [7, 9, 10] . In a mouse model of thermal injury, M2Mf have been demonstrated 3e5 days after thermal injury [11, 12] . These Mf preferentially express receptors for foreign antigens (mannose receptor, b-glucan receptors and scavenger receptors) and produce interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist, IL-10, CCL17, CCL22 and arginase [7, 9, 10] . In addition, IL-10 and CCL17 released from M2Mf inhibit M2Mf generation [13] . Therefore, M1Mf do not appear in hosts whose M2Mf predominate [13] .",

PMN-II isolated from MRSA-susceptible mice functioned to generate M2Mf from R-Mf, while PMN-I isolated from MRSA-resistant mice stimulated R-Mf conversion to M1Mf. PMN-N did not show any activities on the modification of Mf. CCL2 and IL-10 released from PMN-II were shown as effector molecules for M2Mf generation [14] .",

Thermal injury was produced by pressing a custom-made insulated mold (with a 2.5 \u00c2 3.5-cm window) firmly against the shaved back of each mouse and subsequently exposing the area to a gas flame for 9 s using a Bunsen burner equipped with a flame-dispersing cap. This procedure produced a third-degree burn, on approximately 15% of the total body surface area for a 26 g mouse. Immediately after thermal injury, physiologic saline (2 ml/mouse, i.p.) was administered for fluid resuscitation. Animals were then housed until used for experiments. Control mice, not exposed to the gas flame, had their back hair shaved and received physiologic saline (2 ml/mouse, i.p.).",

Eighteen hours after cultivation, the upper chamber was removed and cells in the lower chamber were recultured for 6e30 h. Culture fluids harvested were assayed for CCL17, a typical parameter of M2Mf. Twelve hours after cultivation, CCL17 production by these Mf was first demonstrated, and it peaked 24 h after cultivation. However, the chemokine was not produced by Mf cultured with PMN-II in transwells supplemented with 100 mg/ml of GL (Fig. 1A) . Mf harvested from control cultures (R-Mf only cultured with or without PMN-N) did not produce CCL17 into their culture fluids. As shown in Fig. 1B , R-Mf converted to M2Mf in association with the number of PMN-II added to the upper chamber of the transwells, because the total amounts of CCL17 produced by R-Mf were increased after transwell cultures in response to the numbers of PMN-II added to the cultures. However, the production of CCL17 from Mf stimulated with PMN-II was markedly inhibited (95%) when transwell cultures of 6 \u00c2 10 5 cells/well of R-Mf and 2 \u00c2 10 5 cells/well of PMN-II were performed in the presence of GL (Fig. 1B) . When various doses of GL were added to the transwell cultures, a 10 mg/ml dose was shown to be 50% inhibitory on the production of CCL17. The maximum inhibition of CCL17 production was shown when transwell cultures were performed with 100 mg/ml of GL (Fig. 1C) . These results indicate that GL inhibits M2Mf generation from R-Mf that were stimulated with PMN-II. ",

M2Mf were generated from R-Mf after cultivation with PMN-II in dual-chamber transwells. However, M2Mf were not generated from R-Mf cultured with PMN-II in transwell cultures supplemented with GL. In our previous study, CCL2 and IL-10 released from PMN-II were shown as effector molecules for M2Mf generation, because a mixture of mAbs directed against CCL2 and IL-10 completely inhibited the generation of M2Mf from R-Mf stimulated with the PMN-II culture fluid [14] . In addition, M2Mf generation from R-Mf was demonstrated after treatment with a mixture of rCCL2 and rIL-10. When GL at a dose of 100 mg/ml was added to these cultures, M2Mf generation from R-Mf was not influenced. This suggests that GL does not prevent Mf conversion from R-Mf to M2Mf directly stimulated with CCL2 and IL-10. In contrast, GL showed an ability to inhibit the production of IL-10 and CCL2 from PMN-II. These results suggest that GL inhibits PMN-II-associated Mf conversion from R-Mf to M2Mf through the inhibition of CCL2 and IL-10 production by PMN-II. According to our recent studies [13, 14] , in this experiment, peritoneal Mf were used. Because the repression mechanism of M2 skewing in bone marrow-derived Mf was shown to be different from that of tissue-derived Mf [28] , further studies will be needed to clarify the effect of GL on PMN-II-stimulated M2Mf generation from various Mf populations. As reported in many papers [29e31], the non-cytotoxic properties of GL have been shown. Cytotoxicities of GL (1e200 mg/ml) against various murine and human cells were not demonstrated when the assay was performed by (i) trypan blue dye-exclusion test, (ii) the proliferative responses of cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb or Con A, (iii) H-2 class II antigen expression, and (iv) interferon production. These results strongly suggest that GL at concentrations of 1e100 mg/ml is not cytotoxic to Mf and PMN-II.",

M2Mf generated in association with SIRS manifestations have been determined as effector cells on the increased susceptibility of SIRS mice to various infections. Also, CCL2, a product of the SIRS development, was determined as an effector factor on M2Mf generation. On the other hand, the ability of Th2 cytokines (IL-10, IL-4 and/or IL-13) to induce M2Mf has been well documented [7, 8, 33] . In this paper, GL was shown to be an inhibitor of CCL2 and IL-10 production by PMN-II. The in vitro effect of GL on inhibiting CCL2 production has been reported in cultures of human peripheral blood monocytes infected with HIV or treated with an inducer of M2Mf generation (1-methyladenosine) [15] , murine peritoneal Mf from SIRS mice [34] and R-Mf treated with norepinephrine [35] . Recently, several studies have indicated that the enhancer region of the CCL2 gene is inhibited by glucocorticoids, progesterone and estrogen in cells stimulated with LPS, IL-1 or TNF-a, after binding to their receptors [36, 37] . 18b-Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), a final metabolite of GL in a living body, is similar to deoxycorticosterone and this metabolite binds to glucocorticoid receptors [38] . In fact, this metabolite has been shown to inhibit CCL2 production by peritoneal Mf stimulated with IL-1. GL may suppress CCL2 production through the inhibition of CCL2 gene activation after binding to glucocorticoid receptors. Further studies are required to clarify the molecular mechanism by which GL inhibits CCL2 and IL-10 production.",

These burn-associated immature myeloid cells may be a precursor cell of M2Mf, or a stimulator cell of R-Mf to generate M2Mf. In addition, it has been described in recent papers that TLR reactivity of Mf increases in mice 7 days after thermal injury, but not early after the injury [39, 40] . GL may play a role on the myeloid cell generation or TLR reaction of Mf. Further studies are required.",

PMN with properties similar to PMN-II have recently been demonstrated in the peripheral blood of mice with severe pancreatitis, progressive tumors and severe infections. These mice have also been recognized as hosts with M2Mf. In normal individuals, M1Mf are generated in response to bacterial products or cytokines released in the early stages of host innate responses against bacterial invasion, and contribute to eradicate early bacterial growth [7, 8] . Because M2Mf suppress the generation of M1Mf [13] , M1Mf generation will be minimal even if hosts with a predominance of M2Mf generation are exposed to pathogens. For this reason, carriers of M2Mf would be susceptible to various infections. Utilizing the in vitro assay system, here we showed that GL inhibits M2Mf generation stimulated with PMN-II. The regulation of PMN-II-associated M2Mf generation by GL may provide a new therapeutic strategy, which could influence the outcome of certain severe infections in hosts with M2Mf generation.",
