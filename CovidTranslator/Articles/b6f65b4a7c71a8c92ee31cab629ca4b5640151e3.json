The sensitivity of the JEV RT-LAMP assay was in concordance with that of real-time RT-PCR and 10-fold more sensitive than that of conventional RT-PCR, which the detection limit was 24 copies/ll. The JEV RT-LAMP was highly specific, which no cross-reactivity was found with dengue-2 virus, rabies virus, norovirus, astrovirus and human enterovirus 71. The JEV RT-LAMP assay was more simple and less time-consuming compared to the conventional RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR, which the amplification could be completed in a single tube within 1 h under isothermal conditions at temperature of 63\u00b0C. The results suggest that the RT-LAMP assay can be applied as a practical molecular diagnostic tool for JEV infection and surveillance.",

JEV exists in a zoonotic cycle among mosquitoes, pigs and some birds, and human being as incidental and dead-end hosts. In humans, JEV infection can cause Japanese encephalitis (JE) with severe central nervous system disorders. JE is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in China, India, Japan, Southeast Asia and Western Pacific regions, where 30,000-50,000 cases are reported annually, among these cases, about 30% are fatal. 30% of those who survive will remain irreversible neurologic damage [1] . JE can be controlled by vaccination. The implementation of control program is dependent on accurate surveillance data, which include laboratory confirmation of JEV infection.",

However, antibody test results may be confusing due to considerable cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses [2] . Virus isolation is a definitive diagnosis for JEV infection, however, this assay is usually unavailable owing to less sensitive and more time consuming. RT-PCR assays for detection of specific genomic sequence of JEV have been showed high sensitivity and specificity [3] [4] [5] . However, these assays compared with serologic tests are more time-consuming and require expensive and sophisticated equipments. Most of cases of JE occur in rural areas, where routine RT-PCR diagnostic facilities are limited. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a rapid, simple, sensitive, and specific diagnostic method for JEV infection and surveillance.",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel PCR method developed by Notomi et al. [6] . The most important advantage of the LAMP is amplification of nucleic acids under isothermal conditions at a temperature range of 60-65\u00b0C for 1 h or less. Another advantage of the method is that the amplification from stem-loop structures leads to the accumulation of large amounts of products of various lengths, making detection of amplified nucleic acids much easier [7] . Recently, LAMP technology has been successfully applied for rapid detection of various pathogens, such as West Nile virus (WNV), SARS-CoV, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Plasmodium [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . A reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) assay for detecting JEV was firstly reported by Toriniwa and Komiya and the sensitivity similarly to conventional RT-PCR [13] . Later, Parida et al. [14] reported the application of RT-LAMP assay to detect JEV in the cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients with clinical diagnosis of acute encephalitis, which the sensitivity of JEV detection was comparable to conventional RT-PCR. Yet they have not compared the sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP with real-time RT-PCR assay. Today, realtime PCR assays have a trend to replace conventional PCR or viral culture method in clinical diagnosis for a lot of viral infections because of their high sensitivity and specificity [15] . Here, we report a comparative study of sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP, conventional RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR assays for detection of JEV.",

Notwithstanding, it was regret that only two strains of flaviviruses were involved for evaluation of specificity of JEV RT-LAMP in this study. The results showed that the detection limit of the JEV RT-LAMP assay was equivalent to that of SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR when LAMP amplified products by electrophoretic analysis, 10-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR. The detection limit was 24 copies/ll. However, the sensitivity of detection by the naked-eye inspection based on color change was slightly lower than that by electrophoresis. The detection limit of was 240 copies/ll, which was equivalent to conventional RT-PCR assay.
