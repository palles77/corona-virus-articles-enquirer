The data were extracted from the Appalachian Clinical and Translational Science Institute-Clinical Data Warehouse. Diagnoses included RSV, viral upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, respiratory distress, or respiratory failure. For diagnoses of pneumonia, radiographic reports were reviewed and words such as \"infiltrate,\" \"consolidation,\" and \"pneumonia\" were included in the study. The diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia requiring antibiotics is a physician judgment based on the following criteria: leukocytosis with left shift, elevated total neutrophil count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated procalcitonin, chest radiograph, and clinical appearance. In a study using procalcitonin levels to guide clinical management, lower procalcitonin levels had fewer clinical features of infection. Procalcitonin can provide valuable information to guide clinical decisions. 4 Viral infections were diagnosed by hospital viral respiratory panel polymerase chain reaction (Table 1 ). Fever was defined as a temperature of \u2265100.4\u00b0F.

Children with viral illnesses who had a fever were more likely to have diagnoses of pneumonia, whether they had RSV-positive or RSV-negative illness. The literature supports the need to be wary of the possibility of bacterial pneumonia in children with bronchiolitis. RSV infection decreases bacterial clearance, potentially predisposing to secondary bacterial pneumonia despite increased lung cellular inflammation, and suggests that functional changes occur in the recruited neutrophils that may contribute to the decreased bacterial clearance. 5 Bacterial infection, based on a significant rise of antibody titer and/or on detection of pneumococcal antigen in serum or urine, was observed in 39% of the children with RSV infection. We conclude that a bacterial pathogen should be actively sought when managing patients with lower respiratory tract syndromes, especially in those who have evidence of RSV infection. 6 The interaction between viruses and bacteria is probably much more common and clinically significant than previously understood. Respiratory viruses frequently initiate the cascade of events that ultimately leads to bacterial infection. Early recognition and treatment of these patients will lessen morbidity and mortality. 6 Based on the findings at our institution, we believe that fever is a marker indicating a need to investigate for bacterial pneumonia. There are several limitations to our study. Since sputum cultures are not collected unless a patient is intubated, a definitive bacterial cause cannot be confirmed in most cases. As previously discussed in methods, the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia is a physician judgment. Part of the reason our study is important is that literature does not elucidate any way to definitively determine the presence of bacterial pneumonia in a non-intubated child. Several studies have tried to address this issue. CRP is elevated when bacterial pneumonia is present, but it has less than desirable specificity for distinguishing viral from bacterial pneumonia. 7, 8 Procalcitonin is a better indicator than CRP. A procalcitonin less <0.1 has been found to rule out bacterial infection; however, higher values show overlap in procalcitonin levels found in viral and bacterial sources. 9 Therefore, we are left with clinical judgement based on looking at multiple factors. Since laboratory testing and imaging are discouraged in the initial management of bronchiolitis, perhaps fever can indicate such testing is justified to assist physicians in clinical decision making.",

Delay in care of respiratory illnesses can significantly increase morbidity and mortality. Further research is warranted to investigate the need for more aggressive evaluation of febrile children with viral bronchiolitis. We are aware of the limitations and plan to further investigate our findings. We feel this study is relevant because the data discussed could result in a change in practice for viral bronchiolitis in our young patient population.",
