            "text": "Feline panleukopenia caused by feline parvovirus (FPV), a single-stranded DNA virus, is typically highly contagious and often presents with lethal syndrome. The broad spectrum of possible hosts suggests its potential for transmission from animal to person through close contact with pets. FPV thus serves as an example of the importance of new rapid point-of-care field diagnostic tools for the control and prevention of transmission, especially among rare wild animals and pet cats. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), as a real-time and isothermal method, could be a more affordable alternative to PCR when combined with a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) indicator. In this study, we report a novel FPV lateral flow dipstick RPA (LFD-RPA) instant detection method capable of detecting a range of different FPV strains. The LFD-RPA assay consists of specific primers, probe, and nucleic acid strip. It is capable of detecting 10 2 copies of target nucleic acid per reaction, which is one order of magnitude higher than the sensitivity of traditional PCR. The most suitable reaction conditions for this assay are at 38 \u2103 for 15 min. This paper develops an efficient visual detection system that can eliminate the need for professional staff and expensive and sophisticated equipment for field detection.",

            "text": "Feline parvovirus (FPV) was first isolated in 1961 by Bolion and subsequently identified as belonging to the Parvoviridae family (Cohen and Yohn, 1961; Siegl and Bates, 1985) . The viral particles, with a genome of linear single-stranded nucleic acids of approximately 5000 bases, are spherical without envelope (Agbandje and McKenna, 1993) . FPV has a wide range of hosts, including domestic cats and many different wild and captive carnivores, such as the families of mustelidae, procyonidae, and viverridae (Demeter and Gal, 2009; Allison and Harbison, 2012; Fei-Fei and Yong-Feng, 2017) . Cats infected with FPV commonly display anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, neutropenia, and lymphopenia, with a high fatality rate (Truyen and Parrish, 2013; Stuetzer and Hartmann, 2014) . There has been significant evolution of the virus over the last 50 years, especially in the widely distributed pathogen canine parvovirus (CPV). CPV, which was first detected in 1978, evolved from FPV with mutated genes and has global distribution (Parrish, 1999) . Cats once infected with FPV can carry the virus long term, which increase the possibility of virus transmission between infectious and healthy animals. Many cats undergo a subclinical infection without any clinical signs (Truyen and Parrish, 1992) . In addition to the fecal-oral transmission route, this highly contagious virus can infect other cats by hiding in the environment (Steinel and Parrish, 2001) . FPV has been the subject of several decades of research, but is still rampant around the world.",

These methods are generally available for most viruses. With the development of new detection materials and methods, a series of improvements on the basic PCR method were reported. The programmed step electric field strength (PSEFS) method is more than 100 times faster than conventional slab gel electrophoresis, and on-line capillary electrophoresis method can enhance detection sensitivity (Shin and Lee, 2012; Nan and Yoo, 2013) . Though all kinds of detection methods have been produced commercially, the nucleic acid testing of samples to confirm FPV is still the gold standard. Antigen and antibody detection do not show higher sensitivity and specificity than molecular biological detection. The virus isolation process is, however, complex, and electron microscopy is expensive and requires tedious operator manipulation. A convenient and efficient method of detecting FPV is urgently required.",

The primer pair 1, 2 yielded clear product on the gel when amplified for only 5 min (Fig. 4a , Lanes 2-9), others were less efficiently amplified by comparison, and began to show evident DNA fragmentation at 10 min (Fig. 4a, Lanes 10-21) . This result indicates that primer pair 1 and primer pair 2 are appropriate selections for amplification as DNA templates. We designed the probe for the amplified products of primer pairs 1 and 2 using the Primer Premier 5.0 software package. Considering that the probe design was no less than 45 bp and the probes for primer pair 1 revealed poor characteristics as analyzed by the Primer Premier 5.0 software, we chose primer pair 2 to optimize the probe results. Two probes were designed and added into the RPA amplification system. As shown in Fig. 4b , Probe 1 reduced the detection sensitivity to only 10 5 copies and showed more serious primer dimer compared with Probe 2. Thus we chose Probe 2 for the following study.",

Samples show in Lanes 1-6 are with pEB-VP2 copies from 10 5 to 10 0 copies \u03bcl \u22121 . The Lane 7 showed negative control (NC). 30 min and temperature from 36 \u2103 to 40 \u2103, produced no significant difference in amplification (Figs. 5,6) .

            "text": "Nonetheless, there are some limitations for the use of LFD-RPA detection method. The first, and perhaps most important, step is to design efficient primers. We designed five primer pairs for a wide range of screening (Fig. 4) , and then two probes of primer pair 2 were selected for optimizing. The biggest challenge is to avoid duplexes between primer pairs and probe that might give false positive results and reduce amplification efficiency, further reducing the sensitivity of the primers. Non-specific amplification phenomena also occurred in some cases but could be ameliorated or even removed by primer selection. There present method has not shown serious contamination issues, as seen in LAMP. The first probe design showed a terrible amplification result, but non-specific amplification and false positives were eliminated by optimizing the probe sequence, such as by mutation of one to three bases. All of the detection processes have avoided the dependence on laboratory conditions, but preparation of suspicious examples and virus genome extraction still require laboratory apparatus. Numerous laboratories have developed their own extraction methods, but all depend on centrifugation, as do commercially available kits for nucleic acid extraction (Bag and Saha, 2016; Ling and Zhu, 2019; Zhang and Li, 2019) . Nonetheless, RPA-LFD has greatly reduced the reliance on precision instruments like PCR instruments and electrophoresis systems, bringing field detection closer to reality.",
