            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a common disease and a frequent reason for referral; approximately 1 of every 200 new feline cases presented to American veterinary teaching hospitals represents a cat with FIP [1] . It is also a major factor in kitten mortality [2] . FIP is a fatal immune-mediated disease triggered by infection with a feline coronavirus (FCoV) [3] . FCoV belongs to the family Coronaviridae, a group of enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses that are frequently found in cats [4] . Coronavirus-specific antibodies are present in up to 90% of cats in catteries and in up to 50% of those in single-cat households [5] [6] [7] [8] . Only approximately 5% of FCoVinfected cats develop FIP in a cattery situation, however [5, [9] [10] [11] . Because FIP is not only common but deadly and has no effective long-term management, a rapid and reliable diagnosis is critical for prognostic reasons. A reliable diagnostic test would lessen the suffering of affected patients while avoiding euthanasia of unaffected cats; however, unfortunately, such a test is not currently available. Difficulties in definitively diagnosing FIP arise from nonspecific clinical signs; lack of pathognomonic, hematologic, and biochemical abnormalities; and low sensitivity and specificity of tests routinely used in practice.",

In some instances, however, a mutation occurs in a certain region of the FCoV genome [20] [21] [22] , leading to the ability of the virus to replicate within macrophages, which seems to be a key pathogenic event in the development of FIP [9, 23] produced even more questions that still have to be answered.

In 1978, a virus was identified as the etiologic agent, and in 1979, it was classified as a coronavirus labeled ''feline infectious peritonitis virus'' (FIPV) [25] . FIP has become an increasingly important disease for veterinarians and must now be considered to account for most infectious disease-related deaths in pet cats, thus taking over this title in recent years from feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection, which is decreasing in prevalence and importance. A possible explanation for an increase in the prevalence of FIP is that management of domestic cats has changed [20] . With the introduction of litter boxes, more cats are kept permanently indoors, exposing them to large doses of FCoV in the feces that would previously have been buried outdoors. More and more cats are spending part of their life in crowded environments, such as at cat breeders or shelters, which increases their stress and exposure to FCoV while in such an environment [26] .",

Since then, it has become known that FIPV develops out of FECV spontaneously within the infected cat. Both viruses are identical with regard to their antigenetic properties and, with the exception of a single mutation, their genetic properties, but they are different with regard to their pathogenicity.

Characteristic petal-shaped projections called peplomers (range: 12-24 nm) protrude from the viral surface [29] . These peplomers are responsible for the crown-like (''corona'') appearance of the virus when visualized under the electron microscope, which led to the term coronavirus. The peplomer proteins are used for virus attachment to cellular surface proteins, which act as receptors for the virus. They are shaped so that they can bind specifically to topical enterocytes. Replication of nonmutated FCoV is thus primarily restricted to enterocytes. The mutated FIP-causing FCoV has a broader cell spectrum, including macrophages.",

In cats and mice, however, coronavirus infections can, under certain circumstances, involve several organs. Coronaviruses have a relatively low species specificity. CCV that can cause diarrhea in dogs is closely related to FCoV and can also infect cats. After contact with CCV-containing dog feces, cats develop antibodies that cross-react with FCoV. One CCV strain induced diarrhea in laboratory cats after experimental infection.

Aside from the different degree of neutralization by antisera to CCV, serotypes I and II are different in their growth characteristics in cell culture and in their cytopathogenicity in vitro. FCoV serotype I strains are difficult to grow in cell culture and cause a slowly developing cytopathogenic effect. FCoV serotype II strains, however, grow more rapidly and produce a pronounced cytopathogenic effect [36] . Serotype I is the more prevalent serotype in field infections; between 70% and 95% of isolated FCoV strains in the field in the United States and Europe belong to serotype I. In Japan, however, serotype II predominates [19, 37] . Most cats with FIP are infected with FCoV serotype I. Both serotypes can cause FIP, however, and both can cause clinically inapparent FCoV infections [38] .",

The virus is endemic especially in environments in which many cats are kept together in a small space (eg, catteries, shelters, pet stores). There is virtually no multiple-cat household without endemic FCoV. At least 50% of cats in the United States and Europe have antibodies against coronaviruses. In Switzerland, 80% of breeding cats and 50% of free-roaming cats tested positive for antibodies. In Great Britain, 82% of show cats, 53% of cats in breeding institutions, and 15% of cats in single-cat households had antibodies [8, 27] . FCoV is relatively rare in free-roaming ownerless cats because stray cats are usually loners without close contact with each other. Most importantly, they do not use the same locations for dumping their feces, which is the major route of transmission in multiple-cat households. In a study in Gainesville, Florida, 250 adult feral cats in a trap-neuter-return program were tested for antibodies to coronavirus; 88% of the sera were negative, confirming that most of these cats were not infected [39] . In another study, feral cats were tested at the time they were brought into local shelters (in which multiple cats were kept together) and at 1-to 2-week intervals thereafter. At the time of entering, only a small number of cats had antibodies (approximately 15%); the percentage, however, increased rapidly until virtually all cats in the shelters were infected with FCoV [40] .",

If multiple cats are using the same litter box, they readily infect each other. Continuous reinfection through the contaminated litter box of a cat already infected also seems to play an important role in the endemic survival of the virus. Rarely, virus can be transmitted through saliva, by mutual grooming, by sharing the same food bowl, or through close contact. Sneezed droplet transmission is also possible. Whether or not FCoV transmission occurs to a significant degree at cat shows is still a point of discussion. In one survey, attending cat shows seemed to be a factor of minor significance affecting the incidence of FIP [48] , but in another survey, more than 80% of cats at shows in the United Kingdom were found to have antibodies [8] . Transmission by lice or fleas is considered unlikely [33] . Transplacental transmission can occur, because FIP was found in a 4-dayold kitten and in stillborn and weak newborn kittens born to a queen that had FIP during the later stages of pregnancy [26] . This mode of transmission is uncommon under natural circumstances, however. Most kittens that are removed from contact with adult virus-shedding cats at 5 to 6 weeks of age do not become infected [7] . Most commonly, kittens are infected at the age of 6 to 8 weeks, at a time when their maternal antibodies wane, mostly through contact with feces from their mothers or other FCoV-excreting cats.",

With extremely sensitive reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, it has been shown that many naturally infected healthy carrier cats shed FCoV for at least up to 10 months [50] . Most cats shed virus intermittently, but some become chronic FCoV shedders for years to lifelong, providing a continuous source for reinfection of other cats [51] . Cats that are antibody-negative are unlikely to shed [51, 52] , whereas approximately one third of FCoV antibody-positive cats shed virus [10] . It has been shown that cats with high antibody titers are more likely to shed FCoV and to shed more consistently and higher amounts of the virus [51] . Thus, the height of the titer is directly correlated with virus replication and the amount of virus in the intestines.

Any factors that increase FCoV replication in the intestines increase the probability of the mutation to occur. These factors include physical characteristics (eg, young age and breed predisposition); immune status of the cat, which may be compromised by infections (eg, feline immunodeficiency virus [FIV] or FeLV infection); stress; glucocorticoid treatment; surgery as well as dosage and virulence of the virus; and the reinfection rate in multiple-cat households [66] . It is likely that kittens developing FIP do so because they are subjected to a large virus dose at a time of life when their still undeveloped immune systems are also coping with other infections and the stresses of vaccination, relocation, and neutering [11, 66] . The question as to why one cat develops FIP and many others do not is a subject of intensive research.

It is not the virus itself that causes major damage but the cat's own immune reaction that leads to the fatal consequences. Within approximately 14 days after the mutation has occurred, mutated viruses that have been distributed by macrophages in the whole body, are found in the cecum, colon, intestinal lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and central nervous system (CNS). There are two possible explanations for the events occurring after viral dissemination from the intestines. The first proposed mechanism is that FCoV-infected macrophages leave the bloodstream and enable virus to enter the tissues. The virus attracts antibodies, complement is fixed, and more macrophages and neutrophils are attracted to the lesion [20] ; as a consequence, typical granulomatous changes develop. The alternative explanation is that FIP occurs as a result of circulating immune complexes exiting from the circulation into blood vessel walls, fixing complement [68] and leading to the development of the granulomatous changes. It is assumed that these antigen antibody complexes are recognized by macrophages but are not, as they should be, presented to killer cells and thus are not destroyed. The consequences of the formation of immune complexes in cats depend on their size, antibody concentration, and antigen content. Immune complex deposition most likely occurs at sites of high blood pressure and turbulence, and such conditions occur at blood vessel bifurcations. FIP lesions are common in the peritoneum, kidney, and uvea, all of which are sites of high blood pressure and turbulence [26] .",

The second form without obvious effusions is characterized by granulomatous changes in different organs, including the eyes, as well as the CNS. In the meantime, it has been shown that differentiation between these forms is not useful (and is only of value for the diagnostic approach), because there is always effusion to a greater or lesser degree in combination with more or less granulomatous organ changes present in each cat with FIP.

Mild uveitis can manifest as color change of the iris. Usually, part of or all the iris becomes brown, although blue eyes occasionally appear to be green. Uveitis may also manifest as aqueous flare, with cloudiness of the anterior chamber, which can sometimes be detected only in a darkened room using focal illumination. Large numbers of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber settle out on the back of the cornea and cause keratic precipitates, which may be hidden by the nictitating membrane. In some cats, there is hemorrhage into the anterior chamber. If aqueous humor is tapped, it may reveal elevated protein and pleocytosis [26] . ",

In a retrospective study of 286 cats with neurologic signs, more than half of the cats (47) in the largest disease category (inflammatory diseases) had FIP [94] . Of all cats with FIP, approximately 13% have neurologic signs [95] . These are variable and reflect the area of CNS involvement. Usually, the lesions are multifocal [96] . The most common clinical sign is ataxia, followed by nystagmus and seizures [97] . In addition, incoordination, intention tremors, hyperesthesia, behavioral changes, and cranial nerve defects can be seen [98, 99] . If cranial nerves are involved, neurologic signs like visual deficits and loss of menace reflex may be present, depending on which cranial nerve is damaged. When the FIP lesion is located on a peripheral nerve or the spinal column, lameness, progressive ataxia, tetraparesis, hemiparesis, or paraparesis may be observed [26] . In a study of 24 cats with FIP with neurologic involvement, 75% were found to have hydrocephalus on postmortem examination. Finding hydrocephalus on a CT scan is suggestive of neurologic FIP, because other diseases, such as cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis, and lymphoma, have not been reported to cause these findings [97] .",

Many times, its general clinical signs (eg, chronic fever, weight loss, anorexia, malaise) are nonspecific. A fast and reliable diagnosis would be critical for prognostic reasons and to avoid suffering of the patient. Difficulties in definitively diagnosing FIP, however, arise from unspecific clinical signs; lack of pathognomonic, hematologic, and biochemical abnormalities; and low sensitivity and specificity of tests routinely used in practice. The diagnostic value of frequently used parameters is only known in experimental settings, and some tests have not been widely used in clinical patients. A weighted score system for FIP diagnosis that takes several parameters into account, including background of the cat, history, presence of clinical signs, laboratory changes, and height of antibody titers, has been suggested [95] . This, however, only leads to a certain score or percentage of likelihood of FIP, and thus does not help to confirm the diagnosis definitively. There are, however, certain tests available in the meantime (eg, staining of antigen in macrophages in effusion or tissue) that, at least in the case of a positive result, confirm the diagnosis of FIP 100% [101] .",

Although it is often stated that lymphopenia and neutrophilia are typical for FIP, this change can be interpreted as a typical ''stress leukogram'' that occurs in many severe systemic diseases in cats [101] . In up to 65% of cats with FIP, anemia is present, usually with only a mild decrease in hematocrit. The anemia can be regenerative; in these cases, it is caused mainly by a secondary autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in which autoantibodies to erythrocytes can be found and Coomb's test results are positive. In cats with severe intestinal changes, Heinz bodies can be found in large numbers in erythrocytes [26] , and this can also lead to hemolysis. Alternatively, anemia can be nonregenerative and is then mainly caused by anemia associated with chronic inflammation [41] . Approximately 50% of cats with FIP have nonspecific reactive changes of the bone marrow at necropsy [104] . Thrombocytopenia can commonly be found in cats with FIP as a result of DIC. In experimental infection, thrombocytopenia was detected as early as 4 days after infection [105] . Other parameters indicating DIC, including fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) and D-dimers, are also commonly increased.",

This is found in approximately 50% of cats with effusion and 70% of cats without effusion [107] . This increase in total protein is caused by increased globulins, mainly c-globulins, also leading to a decrease in the albumin-to-globulin ratio [101, 108, 109] . In experimental infections, an early increase of a 2 -globulins was reported [49] , whereas c-globulins and antibody titers increase just before the appearance of clinical signs [5, 49, 69, 77] . The characteristically high levels of c-globulins [110, 111] and the increased antibody titers [5, 112] invite the conclusion that hypergammaglobulinemia is caused by a specific anti-FCoV immune response. Antibody titers and hypergammaglobulinemia show a linear correlation, but the wide variation in anti-FCoV titers at a given concentration of c-globulins indicates that additional (autoimmune) reactions occur during the pathogenesis of FIP [113, 114] . It has been discussed that stimulation of B cells by interleukin-6, which is produced as part of the disease process, additionally contributes to the increase in cglobulins [115] . Total protein in cats with FIP can reach high concentrations of up to 12 g/dL (120 g/L) and more. This, however, only reflects the chronic antigenic stimulation that generally can be caused by any chronic infection the cat is not able to clear through its immune response. Even if the serum total protein concentration is 120 g/L or greater, the likelihood of FIP is only 90%. Cats with these high serum protein concentrations that do not have FIP may suffer from severe chronic stomatitis, chronic upper respiratory disease, dirofilariasis, or multiple myeloma [101] .",

Thus, not only the increase in globulins but the decrease in albumin concentrations seems to be characteristic of FIP. A decrease in serum albumin occurs through decreased production because of liver failure or through protein loss. Protein loss can be attributed to glomerulopathy caused by immune complex deposition, loss of protein caused by exudative enteropathy in case of granulomatous changes in the intestines, or loss of protein-rich fluid in vasculitis. It can also be explained by decreased production in the liver (without compromised liver function), because not only albumin but globulins contribute (although not as importantly) to the plasma oncotic pressure. Thus, an increase in globulins may cause a negative feedback on albumin production in the liver. An optimum cutoff value (maximum efficiency) of 0.8 was determined for the albumin-to-globulin ratio. If the serum albumin-to-globulin ratio is less than 0.8, the probability that the cat has FIP is high (92% positive predictive value); if the albumin-to-globulin ratio is higher than 0.8, the cat likely does not have FIP (61% negative predictive value) [101] .",

Thus, although effusions of a clear yellow color and sticky consistency are often called ''typical,'' the presence of this type of fluid in body cavities alone is not diagnostic (Fig. 3) . The effusion in FIP may be clear, straw-colored, or viscous and may froth on shaking because of the high protein content. The effusion may clot when stored refrigerated [26] . If the sample is bloody, pus filled, or foul smelling or is chylus, FIP is less likely [95] , although effusions in FIP can be different and sometimes red, pink, or almost colorless in appearance.

The protein content of effusion is high because of the high concentration of c-globulins. Other diseases causing similar effusions include lymphoma, heart failure, cholangiohepatitis, and bacterial peritonitis or pleuritis. Measurement of enzyme activity in effusion also is an indication that FIP might be the underlying disease. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is typically high ([300 IU/L) in effusions caused by FIP because it is released from inflammatory cells. Activity of a-amylase also is often high, likely as a result of common pancreatic involvement. The enzyme adenosine deaminase (AD) has been used to distinguish different causes of effusions, and its activity was significantly high in cats with FIP [120] .",

This test was originally developed by an Italian researcher named Rivalta around 1900 and was used to differentiate transudates and exudates in human patients [121] . Other methods have replaced this test in human medicine because of its limited diagnostic value in people. It has not been shown to be diagnostically helpful in dogs with effusion [122] . Nevertheless, this test seems to be useful in cats to differentiate between effusions caused by FIP and effusions caused by other diseases [101] . It is not only the high protein content but the high concentrations of fibrin and inflammatory mediators that induce a positive reaction. To perform this test, three quarters of a reagent tube is filled with distilled water, to which one drop of acetic acid (98%) is added and is mixed thoroughly. On the surface of this solution, one drop of the effusion fluid is carefully layered. If the drop disappears and the solution remains clear, the Rivalta's test result is defined as negative. If the drop retains its shape, stays attached to the surface, or slowly floats down to the bottom of the tube (drop-like or jellyfish-like), the Rivalta's test result is defined as positive. In Fig. 4 . Typical cytology of the effusion in a cat with FIP. a recent study, the Rivalta's test had a positive predictive value of 86% and a negative predictive value of 97% [101] . There are some false-positive results in cats with bacterial peritonitis. Those effusions, however, are usually easy to differentiate (through macroscopic examination, cytology, and bacterial culture). Some cats with lymphoma also have a positive Rivalta's test result, but many of these cases can be differentiated cytologically [101] . Overall, the Rivalta's test is an easy and inexpensive method that does not require special laboratory equipment and can be easily performed in private practice. It provides good predictive values, and thus is a helpful diagnostic test.",

In view of the facts that a large percentage of the healthy cat population is FCoV antibody-positive, that high and rising titers are frequently found in asymptomatic cats, and that most of those cats never develop FIP [126] , antibody titers must be interpreted extremely cautiously [7, 10, 127, 128] . From the time when the first ''FIP test'' was described more than two decades ago [9] to the present, the inadequacies and pitfalls of the test have been the topic of continuous discussion and controversy. Meanwhile, the so-called ''FIP test'' is referred to as the ''feline coronavirus antibody test,'' emphasizing that the latter more correctly describes the antibodies that are detected and react with a large group of closely related coronaviruses. At times, clinicians have mistakenly taken a positive titer to equate with a diagnosis of FIP, and it has been assumed that more cats have died of FCoV antibody tests than of FIP [77] . FCoV tests are often performed for inappropriate reasons. There are five major indications to test for FCoV antibodies: (1) for the diagnosis of FCoV-induced enteritis or to narrow the diagnosis of FIP, (2) for a healthy cat that has had contact with a suspected or known excretor of FCoV, (3) for a cat-breeding facility with the aim of obtaining an FCoV-free environment, (4) to screen a cattery for the presence of FCoV, and (5) to screen a cat for introduction into a FCoVfree cattery [26] .",

Antibody testing can only be useful if the laboratory is reliable and consistent. Methodologies and antibody titer results may vary significantly. A single serum sample divided and sent to five different laboratories in the United States yielded five different results [26] . The antigen used in a test, for example, can play an important role in test sensitivity and specificity (eg, if the antigen used for the test is derived from nonfeline viruses, which is practiced by many commercial laboratories). Thus, it is essential that antibody results that are interpreted and compared by the clinician are always obtained with the same method performed by the same laboratory, and it is essential to use antibody tests validated by the scientific community. Evaluating titers of antibodies gives an idea of the amount of antibodies present. In contrast, tests (eg, in-house tests) that only indicate the presence of antibodies without quantification are not useful. They also produce a high number of false-positive and false-negative results [129] . The choice of the laboratory to be used is critical, and only those that perform quantitative titer evaluations should be used. The laboratory should have established two levels: one is its least significant level of reactivity (or lowest positive titer), and the other is its highest antibody titer value. In searching for a reliable laboratory, repeat samples from the same animal should be sent without warning to the same laboratory and to an FCoV-referenced laboratory for comparison to enable useful interpretation. Serum or plasma samples store well at \u00ff20 C without loss of antibody concentration [26] .",

Many authors agree that low or medium titers do not have any diagnostic value [101, 130, 131] . Approximately 10% of the cats with clinically manifest FIP have negative results. It has been shown that in cats with fulminant FIP, titers decrease terminally [77] . Cats with effusions sometimes have low titers or even no antibodies. This is because large amounts of virus in the cat's body bind to antibodies and render them unavailable to bind antigen in the antibody test or because the antibodies are lost in effusion when protein is translocated in vasculitis. Extremely high titers are of a certain diagnostic value. If the highest measurable titer is present in a cat (thus, it is important to know what the highest titer in a specific laboratory is), it increases the likelihood of FIP. In a recent study, the probability of FIP was 94% in cats with the highest titer when investigating a cat population in which FIP was suspected [101] . The diagnostic value of a high titer is also dependent on the background of the cat. The highest titer in a cat coming out of a multiple-cat household situation is not extremely predictive, because in those households, FCoV is endemic and many cats have high titers, whereas the highest titer in a cat from a single-cat environment is unusual and a stronger indicator of FIP.",

A healthy cat that has no antibodies is considered likely to be free of FCoV, and thus is not infectious to others, does not shed FCoV, and does not develop FIP [10] . It has been shown that the height of the antibody titer directly correlates with the amount of virus that is shed with feces; cats with high antibody titers are more likely to shed FCoV and to shed more consistently with higher amounts of the virus [51] . Thus, height of the titer is directly correlated with the virus replication rate and the amount of virus in the intestines. Antibody measurement is important for the common situation in practice in which a cat is presented because it has been in contact with a cat with FIP or a suspected or known virus excretor. The owner wants to know the prognosis for an exposed cat or wishes to obtain another cat and needs to know whether the exposed cat is shedding FCoV. Also, cat breeders may request testing, with the goal of creating an FCoV-free cattery. Screening a cattery for the presence of FCoV and screening a cat before introduction into an FCoV-free cattery are also important indications.",

            "text": "RT-PCR can be performed to reverse-transcribe coronavirus RNA to cDNA and then to make large quantities of DNA visually detectable. Although FIP-causing viruses are genetic mutants of harmless enteric FCoV, numerous sites exist in the 3C and 7B genes that can be mutated or deleted and confer on the virus the capability to infect and replicate within macrophages. Sometimes, the change can be a single RNA base. As a result, PCR primers to discriminate between FIP-causing viruses and harmless enteric FCoV cannot be designed, and it is not possible to distinguish between a mutated and nonmutated virus by PCR [136] . There are a number of reasons why RT-PCR results are not always easy to interpret. There are several plausible explanations for false-negative PCR results. The assay requires reverse transcription of viral RNA to DNA before amplification of DNA, and degradation of RNA could be a potential problem, because RNases are virtually ubiquitous. There may be sufficient strain and nucleotide sequence variation such that the target sequence chosen for the assay may not detect all strains of FIPV [19] . There are also a number of explanations for false-positive results. First, the assay does not distinguish between ''virulent'' and ''avirulent'' FCoV strains, nor does it differentiate FCoV from CCV or TGEV. Although the role of these viruses in the field is unknown, cats can be experimentally infected with CCV and TGEV [35, 137, 138] ; these infections could result in a positive PCR result. Second, recent studies support the hypothesis that viremia occurs not only in cats with FIP but in healthy carriers. FCoV RNA could be detected in the blood of cats with FIP as well as in the blood of healthy cats that did not develop FIP for a period of up to 70 months [50, 57, 58, 136, 139] . In a study by Gunn-Moore et al [59] , it was shown that in households in which FCoV is endemic, up to 80% of the cats can be viremic, irrespective of their health status, and that the presence of viremia does not seem to predispose the cats to the development of FIP. Therefore, the results of PCR tests must be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical findings and cannot be used as the sole criterion for diagnosing FIP.",

PCR should be performed as quickly as possible after collection, even if samples are frozen; delays in testing may result in false-negative results.

In a recent study involving a large number of cats, immunofluorescence staining of intracellular FCoV antigen in macrophages of effusion had a positive predictive value of 100%. There were no false-positive results. This means that if this staining test is positive, it predicts 100% that the cat has FIP. Unfortunately, the negative predictive value was not high (57%). Cases that stained negative (although the cats did have FIP) can be explained by the fact that the number of macrophages on the effusion smear is sometimes insufficient. Another explanation is a potential masking of the antigen by competitive binding of FCoV antibodies in effusion that displace binding of fluorescence antibodies [101] .",

Ho\u00a8k [144] was able to demonstrate FCoV antigen in the membrana nictitans of cats with FIP. It was shown that positive staining of macrophages in effusion predicts FIP 100% [101] ; the same seems to be true for immunohistochemical staining of tissue macrophages. Immunostaining cannot differentiate between the ''harmless'' nonmutated FCoV and the mutated FIP-causing FCoV. Obviously, only FIP-causing virus is able to replicate in sufficiently large amounts in macrophages, which results in positive staining. Therefore, in addition to histopathology (if pathognomonic lesions are present), detection of intracellular FCoV antigen by immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry is the only way to diagnose FIP definitively. This tool should be used whenever possible.",

No specific antiviral treatment has yet been demonstrated to cure this condition. These cases can be a challenge because they are sometimes difficult to distinguish from cats with FIP, which can manifest solely as granulomatous changes in the intestines leading to diarrhea. FIP diarrhea can only be treated with immune suppression if it is identified, which, conversely, is contraindicated in harmless FCoV infection.

Clinical signs of disease were even more severe in the ribavirin-treated kittens, and their mean survival times were shortened [151] . The most common side effect in cats reported in several studies (already using a low dose of 11 mg/kg) is hemolysis. This develops as a result of sequestration of the drug in red blood cells. In addition, a dose-related toxic effect on bone marrow occurs, primarily on megakaryocytes (resulting in thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage), and erythroid precursors. Later on or at higher dosages, neutrophil numbers are suppressed. Liver toxicity has also been reported [152, 153] .

IFNa has a direct antiviral effect by inducing a general ''antiviral state'' of INFacontaining cells that protects against virus replication. It is not virucidal but merely inhibits viral nucleic acid and protein synthesis. It binds to specific cell receptors that activate enzymes, inhibiting synthesis, assembly, and release of viruses. Human IFNa is marketed as a recombinant product (rHuIFNa) produced by a cloned human IFNa gene expressed in Escherichia coli. There are two common treatment regimens for use of human IFNa in cats: subcutaneous injection of high-dose IFNa (10 4 to 10 6 IU/kg every 24 hours) or oral application of low-dose IFNa (1-50 IU/kg every 24 hours). When given parenterally in high doses, application leads to detectable serum levels. When given parenterally to cats, it becomes ineffective after 3 to 7 weeks because of the development of neutralizing antibodies against the human IFNa, which limits its activity. In a study in which cats were treated with human IFNa subcutaneously, cats became refractory to therapy after 3 or 7 weeks, respectively, depending on whether a high (1.6 \u00c2 10 6 IU/kg) or a lower (1.6 \u00c2 10 4 IU/kg) dose was used [154] .",

Given orally, however, IFNa is inactivated by gastric acid and, like other proteins, destroyed by trypsin and other proteolytic enzymes in the duodenum; therefore, it is not absorbed and cannot be detected in the blood after oral administration [156] . Thus, direct antiviral effects are unlikely after oral administration; instead, it only seems to have immunomodulatory activity. IFNa may bind to mucosal receptors in the oral cavity, stimulating the local lymphoid tissue and leading to cytokine release on lymphatic cells in the oral or pharyngeal area, which triggers a cascade of immunologic responses that finally act systemically [157] . Tomkins [158] showed that orally administered IFNa induced cytokine responses in buccal mucosal lymph nodes, including upregulation of IFNc expression and downregulation of interleukin-4. In studies in mice, it was shown that subcutaneous administration of murine IFNa had an antiviral effect, whereas oral administration caused an immunomodulatory effect. Infection of mice with encephalomyocarditis virus resulted in death in 100% of mice if not treated, in 40% survival of mice when treated with murine IFNa orally at a dose of 2 \u00c2 10 5 IU per mouse, and in 90% survival of mice when given the same dose intraperitoneally [159] confirming the immune modulatory effect after oral application. Therefore, low-dose oral IFNa treatment should not be used in cats with FIP because of its immunomodulatory activity, which may lead to progression of disease.",

IFNs are species specific, and the human IFN clearly differs from the feline one not only regarding its antigenicity (thus causing antibody development in animals) but with respect to its antiviral efficacy in feline cells. Even if feline IFNx is used long term, cats do not develop antibodies. In addition, because it is the homologous species of IFN in cats, it is expected to be more effective than human IFNa. Feline IFNx is a recombinant product, which is produced by baculoviruses containing the feline sequence for this IFN that replicate in silkworms after infection; subsequently, feline IFNx is purified out of homogenized silkworm preparations [160] . Data on the efficacy of feline IFNx in cats with FIP are limited. FCoV replication is inhibited by feline IFNx in vitro [161] . In one study (not controlled and only including a small number of cats), 12 cats that were suspected of having FIP were treated with IFNx in combination with glucocorticoids and supportive care [162] . IFNx was given at a rate of 10 6 IU/kg subcutaneously every 48 hours initially until clinical improvement and, subsequently, once every 7 days. Glucocorticoids were given in the form of dexamethasone in case of effusion (1 mg/kg intrathoracic or intraperitoneal injection every 24 hours) or prednisolone (initially, 2 mg/kg administered orally every 24 hours until clinical improvement, then gradually tapered to 0.5 mg/kg administered every 48 hours). Although most cats died, 4 cats survived over a period of 2 years; all had initially presented with effusions. Even though there was no control group in this study and FIP was not even confirmed in the 4 surviving cats, these results are somewhat interesting (because cats with other effusion-associated diseases would not be expected to survive for 2 years without proper treatment), and further studies would certainly be interesting.",

In natural circumstances, cats go outside to defecate and bury their feces, in which case the virus remains infectious hours to days (slightly longer in freezing conditions). Domesticated cats have been introduced to litter boxes, however, in which FCoV may survive for several days, and possibly up to 7 weeks in dried-up feces.

The owner may want to know the prognosis for the exposed cat or may want to obtain another cat and needs to know whether the exposed cat is shedding FCoV. It is likely that the cat is antibody-positive, because 95% to 100% of cats exposed to FCoV become infected and develop antibodies approximately 2 to 3 weeks after FCoV exposure. There are a few cats, however, that may be resistant to FCoV infection. It has been shown that a low number of cats in FCoV endemic multiple-cat households continuously remain antibody-negative [163] . The mechanism of action for this resistance is still unknown. The owner should be advised that the cat in contact is likely to have antibodies and reassured that this is not necessarily associated with a poor prognosis. Most cats infected with FCoV do not develop FIP, and many cats in single-or 2-cat households eventually clear the infection and become antibody-negative in a few months to years. Cats can be retested (using the same laboratory) every 6 to 12 months until the results of the antibody test are negative. Cats exposed only once often have a quicker reduction in antibodies. To exclude any risk at all, the owner should be advised to wait until antibody titers of all cats are negative before obtaining a new cat. Some cats, however, remain antibody-positive for years. A rise in antibody titer or maintenance at a high level does not necessarily indicate a poor prognosis for the cat. In a study following cats with high titers, the titers of 50 of these cats remained at a high level on at least three occasions, yet only 4 cats died of FIP [26] . In contrast, in a situation of endemic infection, a constantly low titer is highly indicative that a cat is not going to develop FIP.",

Approximately one third of antibody-positive cats excrete virus [10, 11, 130, 165, 166] ; thus, every antibody-positive cat has to be considered infectious. After 3 to 6 months, antibody titers can be retested to determine whether cats have become negative. Alternatively, RT-PCR testing of (several) fecal samples can be performed to detect shedders. It is important to detect chronic FCoV carriers so that they can be removed. In large multiple-cat environments, 40% to 60% of cats shed virus in their feces at any given time. Approximately 20% shed virus persistently. Approximately 20% are immune and do not shed virus. Repeated PCR testing of feces should be performed at weekly intervals for 2 months or more to document carriers.

Kittens of FCoV-shedding queens should be protected from infection by maternally derived antibody until they are 5 to 6 weeks old. An early weaning protocol for the prevention of FCoV infection in kittens has been proposed by Addie and Jarrett [26] , which consists of isolation of queens 2 to 3 weeks before parturition, strict quarantine of queens and kittens, and early weaning at 4 to 6 weeks of age. This procedure is based on the findings that some queens do not shed the virus and some queens stop shedding after several weeks if not re-exposed. Even if queens do shed, young kittens have maternal resistance to the virus [7] . Early removal of kittens from the queen and prevention of infection from other cats may succeed in preventing infection in these kittens. Although straightforward in concept, isolation of queens and early weaning is not as simple as it may seem. The procedure requires quarantine rooms and procedures that absolutely ensure a new virus does not enter. It is an advantage when the isolated queens are not shedding FCoV, when they are shedding low levels, or when they can clear the infection early after being isolated. The single most important factor is the number of animals. The success of early weaning and isolation in FCoV control depends on effective quarantine and low numbers of cats (\\5 cats) in the household. Also, human abodes do not easily allow adequate quarantine space for large numbers of queens and kittens, and the time and money required to maintain quarantine increase in proportion to the number of queens and litters under quarantine. In a study in large catteries in Switzerland in which the same protocol was followed, early weaning failed and viral infection of kittens as young as 2 weeks old was demonstrated [167] . It is clear that low FCoV exposure can delay infection, whereas high exposure can overcome maternally derived immunity at an early age.",

Additionally, some breeders believe that early weaning exacts a social price on the kittens. In recognition of both concerns, it is recommended that early weaning not be undertaken without careful consideration. FCoV-free households do not require routine isolation and early weaning. When kittens are isolated with their queen, special care must be taken during the period from 2 to 7 weeks of age to socialize the kittens. The success of early weaning should also be monitored, and it should not be continued if it is not successful. Kittens that have been successfully reared free of FCoV should be antibody-negative at 12 weeks of age. Even if kittens can be raised free of FCoV, they may become infected sooner or later. Therefore, the objective of isolation and early weaning should not be to prevent infection but to delay it [164] . For early weaning to be effective, it is best for kittens to be taken to a new home (with no other cats) at 5 weeks of age. Even then, however, early weaning is not always successful.",

If cats are housed individually, it may be necessary to test them all. Cats in households with fewer than 10 cats and no new acquisitions and cats that are isolated from each other in groups of 3 or less often eventually lose their FCoV infection [169] . Once they have been established, antibody-negative catteries can be maintained free of FCoV by monitoring new cats before they are introduced. Thus, cats should be screened before introduction, and antibody-positive cats should never be taken into the household. Cat breeders often also request that their cats be screened for FCoV antibodies before mating. If the cat is healthy and antibody-negative, it can be safely mated with another antibody-negative cat. If the cat is antibody-positive, it should not be mated with a cat from an FCoV-free environment [164] .",

Comparison of shelters with different types of handling revealed a significant correlation between an increase in the number of handling events outside the cages and an increase in the percentage of antibody-positive cats. In a study in which feral cats were tested at the time they were brought into local shelters (in which multiple cats were kept together) and at 1-to 2-week intervals thereafter, only a low number of cats had antibodies at the time point of entering, but the percentage increased rapidly until virtually all cats in the shelters were infected with FCoV [40] .",

This vaccine, administered intranasally, produces local immunity (IgA antibodies) at the site where FCoV first enters the body (the oropharynx) and also induces cell-mediated immunity. The vaccine has been available in the United States since 1991 and has been introduced in many European countries. The concerns of such a vaccine are safety and efficacy. Safety concerns focus on whether the vaccine could cause FIP or produce ADE. Although some experimental vaccine trials with vaccines that never appeared on the market have recorded ADE on challenge [176, 177] , field studies have demonstrated that this intranasal vaccine is safe. In two extensive placebo-controlled double-blind field trials there was no development of FIP or ADE [178] [179] [180] . There were a few immediate side effects after application, such as sneezing, vomiting, or diarrhea, which were not statistically different in the vaccinated group and the placebo group [178] .",

In a survey of 138 cats belonging to 15 cat breeders in which virtually all the cats had antibodies, no difference was found in the development of FIP between the vaccinated group and the placebo group [178] . Thus, vaccination in an FCoV endemic environment or in a household with known cases of FIP is not effective. In one of the placebo-controlled doubleblind trials that was performed in Switzerland in a group of cats that did not have contact with FCoV before vaccination, a small but statistically significant reduction in the number of cats that developed FIP was noted [178, 182] . Because the vaccine is ineffective when cats have already had contact with FCoV, antibody testing may be beneficial before vaccination. One disadvantage is that most cats develop antibodies after vaccination, thus making the establishment and control of an FCoV-free household difficult. In conclusion, study results do not clearly identify whether vaccination has no effect versus a small effect. Although only marginally if at all efficacious, the vaccine is at least safe and does not induce ADE.",
