Live-poultry markets were identified as a risk factor for H5N1 influenza, 8 and slaughter of all poultry in Hong Kong brought the outbreak in human beings to a stop. To reduce the possibility of re-emergence of H5N1, changes were Wet markets-a continuing source of severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza? The establishment of permanent live-animal markets (wet markets) in many countries means that there is usually carry over of animals from one day to the next, and more expensive animals (eg, pheasants in poultry markets, civet cats in red-meat markets) can stay from days to weeks. Daily introduction of new animals provides optimum conditions for amplification and perpetration of disease agents such as influenza. The influenza virus has a segmented negatively stranded RNA genome with a propensity for reassortment and generation of novel agents. Add the Context Live-animal markets (wet markets) provide a source of vertebrate and invertebrate animals for customers in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Wet markets sell live poultry, fish, reptiles, and mammals of every kind. Livepoultry markets (mostly chicken, pigeon, quail, ducks, geese, and a wide range of exotic wild-caught and farm-raised fowl) are usually separated from markets selling fish or red-meat animals, but the stalls can be near each other with no physical separation. Despite the widespread availability of affordable refrigeration, many Asian people prefer live animals for fresh produce. Wet markets are widespread in Asian countries and in countries where Asian people have migrated. Live-poultry markets were the source of the H5N1 bird-influenza virus that transmitted to and killed six of 18 people in Hong Kong.",

These researchers also found serological evidence of infection in raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procuyoinboides).

This question confronts public-health officials worldwide, particularly infectious disease personnel in those regions of the world most affected by the disease and the economic burden of SARS, including China, Taiwan, and Canada. Will the virus re-emerge from wet markets or from laboratories working with SARS CoV, or are asymptomatic infections ongoing in human beings? Similar questions can be asked about a pandemic of influenza that is probably imminent. Knowledge of the ecology of influenza in wet markets can be used as an early-warning system to detect the reappearance of SARS or pandemic influenza. coronavirus (CoV) and wet markets as a possible source of the original outbreak. These researchers isolated a novel coronavirus from Himalayan palm civets (Paguna larvata) found in live-animal markets in Guangdong and provided serological evidence of infection of other animals (raccoon dogs, Nyctereutes procuyoinboides) and human beings in the markets. The animal isolates were different from the human SARS CoV in that they had an additional 29-nucleotide sequence not found in the human isolates (figure 2). WHO has had a task force working with Chinese authorities to develop strategies to define the ecology of SARS CoV. At the October, 2003, meeting Options to Control Influenza, in Okinawa, Japan, reports of replication of SARS CoV with disease signs in primates, 15 ferrets and cats, 16 and mice 17 provide animal models for vaccine and antiviral development, but suggest a wider host range in nature. After the identification of SARS-like CoV in civet cats, 14 civets were banned from wet markets in China but are again now available. Customer demand has driven the price for civet cats up to US$200, making it likely that such animals could be obtained whether or not they were banned. We lack information on the transmissibility of the SARS CoV-like virus in animals, the mode of transmission (oral, faecal), the role of intermediate hosts (eg, pigs and quail for influenza), environmental stability, and serological screening at the human-animal interface.",

Thus H5N1 influenza continues to circulate in Asia and periodically spills over to human beings through live-poultry markets. To date, H5N1 after 1997 all aquatic birds, including ducks and geese (the original source of influenza viruses), were eliminated from the markets and sold chilled, and a representative sample of each truckload of poultry entering Hong Kong is screened to assess the level of H5N1 immunity. Despite these changes highly pathogenic H5N1 of multiple new genotypes reappeared in retail poultry markets in 2001, and all poultry were again destroyed to prevent transmission to human beings. 9 Marketing practices were also changed to reduce the risk from influenza virus, including removal of quail (a newly recognised host susceptible to all subtypes of influenza and a potential intermediate host 10, 11 ) and the introduction of a clean day every month when all markets are emptied simultaneously and cleaned. Despite these additional changes H5N1 viruses reappeared in late 2002 and in early 2003 in the live-bird markets, in wild migrating birds, and on farms, and killed many aquatic birds in Kowloon and Penfold parks in Hong Kong. In February, 2003, H5N1 virus was again transmitted to human beings and killed two infected persons in a family of four, and WHO issued a pandemic alert. 12 The reappearance of H5N1 in human beings coincided with the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and caused initial confusion in the diagnosis of the causative agent of SARS.",

A similar policy of vaccination is being used on farms in the Mainland that provide live poultry to Hong Kong, again holding the promise of reducing the possibility of introduction of H5N1 virus. The transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 to wild migrating birds in Hong Kong in 2003 and the unknown distribution of these H5N1 viruses in mainland China is a worry.
