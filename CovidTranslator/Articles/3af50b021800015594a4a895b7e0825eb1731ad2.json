            "text": "Fecal indicator bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (E.coli) and Enterococcus, have been widely used to indicate the presence of pathogens. However, the suitability of fecal indicator bacteria to represent health risks is still being challenged, particularly in tropical aquatic environments. The objective of this study is to understand the occurrence and prevalence of indicators and pathogens in areas with contrasting land use, as well as to identify the major correlations between indicators, pathogens and environmental parameters. The spatial and temporal variation of indicators and pathogens was studied to examine the distribution patterns for areas with different land use, and the impact of seasonal changes on microbial populations. A total of 234 water samples were sampled for two years from reservoirs and their tributaries, and tested for fecal indicator bacteria, coliphages, human specific markers, pathogenic bacteria and viruses. The prevalence of indicators and pathogens in reservoirs were generally low, while relatively high concentrations were observed in tributaries to varying degrees. Of the enteric viruses, norovirus GII was among the most prevalent and had the highest concentration. Although strong correlations were found between indicators, only relatively weak correlations were found between indicators and pathogens. The results in this study showed that none of the bacteria/phage indicators were universal predictors for pathogens. Inclusion of the alternative indicators, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Bacteroides and human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) to monitoring programs could help to determine whether the fecal source was human. The microbial distribution patterns allow the classification of sampling sites to different clusters and thus, help to identify sites which have poor water quality. This approach will be useful for water quality management to pinpoint factors that influence water quality and help to prioritize sites for restoration of water quality.",

Waterborne pathogens include viruses and bacteria which can be introduced into the urban water cycle via leaking sewers, urban runoff, agricultural runoff and wastewater discharges (Arnone and Walling, 2007) . Enteric viruses are widely recognized as the commonest and most hazardous waterborne pathogens, causing both sporadic and outbreak-related illnesses (La Rosa et al., 2012) . Among enteric viruses, noroviruses, astroviruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses and hepatitis A virus are the most extensively studied (Aw et al., 2009; Ganesh and Lin, 2013) . Of these, adenovirus, caliciviruses (includes norovirus), enterovirus and hepatitis A virus are listed in the USEPA CCL3, which are currently not subjected to any proposed or promulgated national primary drinking water regulations, and which may require regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) (USEPA, 2009) . Little is known about the epidemiology of enteric viruses as well as their occurrence and behavior in tropical aquatic environments, since most studies have been conducted in temperate and cold regions.",

            "text": "In addition to enteric viruses, other potential emerging viral pathogens (e.g. hepatitis E virus, sapovirus, nipah virus, coronavirus, bird flu virus) may originate from wild animals in tropical catchment forests. Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a causative agent of human hepatitis E, is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus from the genus Hepevirus (Nan et al., 2017) . HEV is transmitted primarily in humans by the fecal-oral route through contaminated drinking water or food. Outbreaks normally occur in developing or undeveloped countries (Ahmad et al., 2010; Howard et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2011) . However, recent evidence has shown that various animal species have serum antibodies to HEV, suggesting hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease (Meng, 2010; Nan et al., 2017) . Li et al. (2005) reported that Genotype 3 HEV RNA was detected in both patient serum and wild boar meat (Li et al., 2005) . This raises concern that HEV may be discharged into tributaries through animals which exist in forested areas. Sapovirus is another emerging enteric virus. It belongs to Caliciviruses, and causes acute viral gastroenteritis (Haramoto et al., 2008; Sano et al., 2011) . As it has been identified in bats, dogs, pigs and mink (Oka et al., 2015) , it may also exist in tropical catchment waters. Other potential zoonotic viruses include coronavirus (such as SARS) (Casanova et al., 2009; de Wit et al., 2016) and bird flu virus (influenza A virus subtypes H5N1 and H7N9) (Peiris et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013) .",

P. aeruginosa is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen and occurs naturally in aquatic environments. However, the infections caused by P. aeruginosa in recreational waters should not be neglected, particularly for young children, elder people and immune-compromised population. Moreover, P. aeruginosa is currently one of the major bacteria that is capable of multiple-drug resistance (Aloush et al., 2006; Hirsch and Tam, 2010) . Another bacterium that can cause recreational waterrelated illness is Salmonella. Although Salmonellae are usually known as foodborne pathogens, water could be a potential mode of transmission. Salmonella can be found in the feces of a large variety of vertebrates, including humans, reptiles, birds, farm and wild animals (Matias et al., 2016; Silva et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "To date, water quality monitoring is still based on the detection of fecal indicator bacteria (i.e. E. coli and Enterococcus). Ideally, fecal indicator bacteria should originate from the same host as the pathogen and have similar survival pattern as the pathogen outside the host. However, substantial evidence shows the limitations of using only these indicators to represent the water quality from a fecal point of view (Byappanahalli et al., 2006; Field and Samadpour, 2007; Wu et al., 2011) . Studies have shown the persistence of fecal indicator bacteria in tropical regions (Byappanahalli and Fujioka, 1998; Carrillo et al., 1985) . This could be due to the higher humidity, warmer conditions, heavier rainfall with highly erosive rains that encourage the splash effect and transportation of microorganisms in tropical regions (Rochelle-Newall et al., 2015) . Although there is less seasonal variation in tropical regions as compared to temperate regions, the monsoon season (wet season) and inter-monsoon season (dry season) showed significant difference in the occurrence of microorganisms (Chuah and Ziegler, 2018; Nguyen et al., 2016; Rochelle-Newall et al., 2016) . Consequently, alternative indicators such as coliphages and human specific markers have been suggested to address the limitation of fecal indicator bacteria (Field and Samadpour, 2007; Harwood et al. 2013 Harwood et al. , 2014 . The relationship between the presence of pathogens including viruses and alternative indicators has been studied. However, disparate results have been obtained. Harwood et al. (2014) and Jofre et al. (2016) conducted a comprehensive review of the correlations between alternative indicators and coliphages with epidemiological studies and pathogens. Wu et al. (2011) suggested several factors that could contribute to the varied results in different studies. Sample size and the number of positive samples for pathogens are among the main factors that determine the correlations between indicators and pathogens.",

Sampling sites and land use categories were mapped with ArcGIS version 10.3.1. Software (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). Land use shape files were obtained from the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) and PUB (Singapore's National Water Agency) where the land use subcategories were defined by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). However, to reduce the number of parameters, subcategories were merged into 5 main categories: (i) Residential, (ii) Urban, (iii) Green, (iv) Agricultural and (v) Water body. The characteristics for each sampling location are described in Table 1 . In order to reduce the number of parameters, the weightage of land use (which is the combination of different land use categories) was calculated. For the calculation of weightage, numbers 4, 3, 2 and 1 were assigned to Residential, Urban, Agriculture and Green, respectively.

The correlations were examined (i) between indicators (Table 3) ; (ii) between indicators and pathogens (Table 4 ); (iii) among pathogens (Table 5) ; and (iv) between environmental parameters and indicators/pathogens (Table 6 ). This study found significant correlations among the fecal indicator bacteria (r \u00bc 0.670) and coliphages (r \u00bc 0.511), as well as between fecal indicator bacteria and coliphages (r \u00bc 0.432e0.801). Among the pathogens, P. aeruginosa was the only pathogen that had moderate to good correlations with fecal indicator bacteria/coliphages (r \u00bc 0.388e0.692) (Table 4) , while weak correlations were found between fecal indicator bacteria/coliphages and Salmonella (r \u00bc 0.199e0.265), and also Aichi virus (r \u00bc 0.124e0.293). Alternative indicators which are suggested to be highly associated with human waste contamination were also examined in this study. Correlations analyses showed that FRNA G2 (r \u00bc 0.422e0.502), B. theta (r \u00bc 0.340e0.497) and PMMoV (r \u00bc 0.264e0.419) were correlated with fecal indicator bacteria/coliphages (Table 3) . FRNA G2, B. theta and PMMoV which are more specific to human fecal pollution, were significantly correlated with most of the indicators except FRNA G4. Unfortunately, most of the enteric viruses did not have significant correlations greater than 0.3 with the alternative indicators, except for Aichi virus and sapovirus. Improved correlations were found between Aichi virus and HPyVs (r \u00bc 0.471) and also between Aichi virus and M. smithii (r \u00bc 0.315), while sapovirus was correlated with FRNA G3 (r \u00bc 0.382) and M. smithii (r \u00bc 0.332). Although alternative indicators did not improve the correlations with P. aeruginosa as compared with fecal indicator bacteria/coliphages, however, moderate correlations were found with B. theta, HPyVs and PMMoV (r \u00bc 0.325e0.480). Correlation with Salmonella also improved with B. theta (r \u00bc 0.321). The results from this study revealed very weak correlations among the pathogens (r < 0.3), except for Salmonella and P. aeruginosa detected with qPCR (r \u00bc 0.313). Note that there were two methods, qPCR and IDEXX method, used in this study for P. aeruginosa quantification and both methods were significantly correlated at r \u00bc 0.440. In terms of environmental factors, an increase in temperature significantly reduced the concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria, coliphages, FRNA G2, B. theta, HPyVs and bacterial pathogens, while EC and salinity showed the opposite trend. As expected, the lower the DO, the higher the concentrations of bacteria and coliphages. Turbidity was generally correlated with the concentrations of bacteria and coliphage, but not with the concentration of enteric viruses. The correlation analysis also showed that the impact of daily rainfall was positively, although weakly correlated with the occurrence of microbial indicators, while weak negative correlations were observed between antecedent dry period and microbial indicators. In addition, there was a greater influence of land use on the concentrations of bacteria and coliphages compared to enteric viruses. Among the indicators and pathogens, PMMoV was significantly correlated with land use (r \u00bc 0.451).",

Cluster analysis was used to group the sampling sites based on the occurrence of microorganisms. Data was log transformed and resemblance was conducted with Bray-Curtis similarity. Hierarchical clustering was applied for the cluster analysis and the clustering result is illustrated by a dendrogram (Fig. 5) . At a similarity of 87%, the sampling sites can generally be classified into five main clusters (i.e. I to V). The reservoir samples were clustered into two main clusters, I and II where Cluster I comprised 7 reservoir samples collected from sampling areas B, D, E and G. Sampling areas B, D and G are reservoirs located in areas where there are extensive forests and/or green areas with minimal impact from anthropogenic activities.",

Hence, the water quality is less impacted by nearby residential land use. In comparison, reservoir samples from sampling areas A, C and F were grouped into Cluster II, where industrial, commercial and residential (including several construction sites) zones are predominant. The water samples collected from tributaries at sampling area A (sampling site: A_tributary1) and sampling area C (sampling site: C_tributary1) were classified into two independent clusters, Cluster III and Cluster IV, respectively. The rest of the tributaries had high similarity in term of the distribution of microorganisms and were classified into the same cluster, Cluster V. Due to the large complexity between samples, PCO analysis was conducted to understand the similarity or dissimilarity of the microorganism community between samples. The PCO plot revealed that 71.1% of the variation could be explained through PCO 1 and PCO2 (Fig. 6) . By limiting the r value to greater than 0.5, the main variables that contributed to PCO1 were E. coli (r \u00bc -0.92), Enterococcus (r \u00bc \u00c00.90), somatic coliphage (r \u00bc \u00c00.85), F\u00fe coliphage (r \u00bc \u00c00.71), total coliphage (r \u00bc \u00c00.99), FRNA G2 (r \u00bc \u00c00.75), B. theta (r \u00bc \u00c00.62), P. aeruginosa (r \u00bc \u00c00.71), Pseudalert (r \u00bc \u00c00.89) and PMMoV (r \u00bc \u00c00.65).

Based on reservoir data, Enterococcus counts were always low in reservoirs compared to tributaries and generally fulfilled the requirement for primary contact recreational activities, except for sampling area F (geometric mean \u00bc 41.5 MPN/ 100 mL; 80% of the time the Enterococcus counts were below 200 counts/100 mL).

Unfortunately, the source of contamination is difficult to track based on fecal indicator bacteria as these indicators could be released into environment by both humans and animals fecal sources (Souza et al., 1999) . As a result, the human specific markers such as B. theta, HPyVs and M. smithii have been suggested as potential markers for human waste contamination (Carson et al., 2005; Harwood et al., 2014; Johnston et al., 2010; McQuaig et al. 2009 McQuaig et al. , 2012 Yampara-Iquise et al., 2008) . In this study, a high prevalence of B. theta was observed compared to HPyVs and M. smithii. An earlier study showed that B. theta was more sensitive towards the detection of human waste contamination, although HPyVs gave better specificity in terms of human source tracking (unpublished data). Carson et al. (2005) found a cross-reactivity with dogs (16% of 31 samples) in their B. theta assay (Carson et al., 2005) . However, Griffith et al. (2009) showed that the detection of B. theta was among the most reliable methods to detect samples containing human fecal material with no false positive results (Griffith et al., 2009) .",

In this study, FRNA G2 was the most prevalent genotype among the four genotype groups. This may explain the high probability of human waste contamination in the water samples tested. However, studies also revealed the possible detection of FRNA G2 in poultry, pig and cattle feces (Schaper et al., 2002b) , and the presence of FRNA G4 in human feces (Hsu et al., 1995) . In this study, a higher prevalence of FRNA G2 (detection frequency \u00bc 52.3%) was found compared to FRNA G3 (detection frequency \u00bc 5%). This finding contradicts an earlier study which reported that FRNA G2 seems to be more prominent in cold regions, while FRNA G3 dominated in warm regions (Furuse et al., 1978) . One of the possible reasons could be the higher persistence of FRNA G2 compared to FRNA G3 in natural environments (Schaper et al., 2002a) . It is also interesting to note that a relatively high concentration of FRNA G1 was observed at sampling area G, a protected catchment with rich biodiversity. This is consistent with the fact that FRNA G1 is associated with fecal wastes from animals (Cole et al., 2003) .",

Norovirus GII showed a similar range of detection rate (48%e69%) with earlier studies in Singapore (Aw and Gin, 2011; Liang et al., 2015; Rezaeinejad et al., 2014) . A relatively high prevalence of norovirus GII was also reported in environmental surface waters at different locations (Calgua et al., 2013; Kishida et al., 2012; Kiulia et al., 2014; Lee and Kim, 2008) . In this study, a higher prevalence of norovirus GII (51.8%) was found compared to norovirus GI (40%). A virus decay study conducted in groundwater revealed that norovirus GII was more persistent than norovirus GI (Charles et al., 2009) . As currently there is no available cell line for the norovirus infectivity test, the detection of norovirus relies on molecular methods. Teunis et al. (2008) demonstrated the low infectious dose for norovirus, where the 50% infectious dose, LD 50 was equivalent to 1015 genomes copies or 18 viruses (Teunis et al., 2008) . Ngazoa et al. (2008) reported approximately 30% of norovirus genomes were detected in river water after 30 days incubation at 25 C. This explains the high prevalence of norovirus in surface waters found in this study. Another study on viral persistence revealed that the reduction rate of nucleic acid of norovirus surrogates was significantly lower than the reduction rate of infectivity (Bae and Schwab, 2008) . Nevertheless, extra precautions are needed when interpreting health risks brought by norovirus due to its low infectious dose.",

Studies have shown that a high persistence of influenza A viruses in environmental waters which can remain infectious over a long period, depending on the strain types and environmental factors (e.g. salinity, temperature, pH) (Dublineau et al., 2011; Keeler et al. 2013 Keeler et al. , 2014 Stallknecht et al., 1990; Webster et al., 1992) .

Heijnen and Medema et al.'s study suggested the discharge of treated sewage was not the primary source of influenza A virus detected in river water but rather, was mainly from aquatic birds due to the very low prevalence of influenza A virus in sewage samples (1 out of 10 samples). In our study, the highest mean concentration of influenza A virus was found at sampling area B (mean \u00bc 3063.85 GC/L), which was an area dominated by chicken farming.",

A low prevalence of adenovirus was also reported in Choi and Jiang's study (2005) , where 16% out of 114 river samples from California had positive detections of adenovirus. In the same study, negative results were reported for infection of adenovirus using two human tissue culture cell lines, HEK293A and A5949 (Choi and Jiang, 2005) . Similarly, this study also found negative results for infectious adenovirus using the integrated cell culture-PCR (ICC-PCR) with Human colon carcinoma (CaCo-2) cell line in surface waters. In contrast, positive infectivity results were observed in samples collected from the influent of a wastewater treatment plant (data not shown). The absence of infectious adenovirus observed in surface waters could be due to the loss of viral infectivity after exposure to sunlight or other harsh conditions in the natural environment, in addition to the low concentrations detected. Comparing the occurrence data obtained in this study with earlier studies conducted in Singapore, a clear trend of reduction in enteric viruses (i.e. adenovirus, rotavirus and enterovirus) was found (Aw and Gin, 2011; Liang et al., 2015; Rezaeinejad et al., 2014) .

These factors include the survival and transport of indicators/pathogens in the natural environment, shedding patterns among host populations, detection method, percentage of positive detection, land uses, as well as geographic variation (Wu et al., 2011) . The major drawback for fecal indicator bacteria and coliphages is that these bacteria/ phages cannot indicate the source of pollution as they are present in both human and animal wastes (Havelaar et al., 1986) . As such, it is not surprising that very weak or even no correlation was found between indicators/coliphages and enteric viruses, which are mainly excreted from infected humans. Apart from the different shedding patterns for human pathogens, fecal indicator bacteria are also able to persist for extended periods, and may even grow in the natural environment (Byappanahalli et al., 2006) . In an earlier controlled laboratory study, the survival of indicators and human specific indicators was examined together with adenovirus under the effects of sunlight and salinity (Liang et al., 2017) . The study showed that B. theta had slightly lower decay rates compared to adenovirus in both fresh and sea water, while M. smithii had higher decay rates than adenovirus in both fresh and seawaters. These differences may explain the slightly better correlations between B. theta and adenovirus compared to other indicators in this study (r \u00bc 0.233).",

These differences could have implications on the final results due to variations in sensitivity, recovery rate and specificity. Thus, similar detection methods will usually yield better correlations. In this study, P. aeruginosa quantified with IDEXX kits correlated better with indicators (examined with culture-based method) than P. aeruginosa quantified by the molecular method. The low shedding rate and low percentage of positive detection in pathogens also contributed to the lack of correlation with indicators. Among the pathogens, P. aeruginosa (quantified by IDEXX kit) is the only pathogen that achieved high detection frequency (91.8%) and hence, stronger correlations with indicators were observed. Apart from the factors discussed above, land use also played a major role in the correlation analysis. Compared with the earlier studies conducted in Singapore, relatively weak correlations were found in this study, particularly between the indicators and pathogens. The reason being this study extended the sampling sites to other major reservoirs in Singapore which covered various types of land use, whereas the previous study focused on a single urbanized reservoir and its tributaries. When separate correlation analysis was conducted based on specific sites, the correlations improved significantly.",
