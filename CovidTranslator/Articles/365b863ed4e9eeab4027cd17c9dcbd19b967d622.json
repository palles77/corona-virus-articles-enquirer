Virus-positive weeks were associated with greater cold and asthma severity (p<0.0001 and p=0.0002 respectively). Furthermore, virus-positive illnesses had increased duration and severity of cold and asthma symptoms, and more frequent loss of asthma control (47% vs. 22%, p=0.008). While allergen-sensitized vs. non-sensitized children had the same number of viral infections, the former had 47% more symptomatic viral illnesses (1.19 vs. 0.81 per month, p=0.03).",

For example, HRV can cause asymptomatic infections, common colds, or exacerbations of asthma. This gap in knowledge is partly related to difficulties in detecting HRV. Early studies of HRV epidemiology used diagnostics based on tissue culture, which is insensitive. Recent studies employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other molecular techniques indicate that there are new branches on the HRV family tree, 5-8 and one characteristic of the recently detected HRV-C species is that they cannot be detected by standard tissue culture. New molecular assays make it possible to conduct epidemiologic studies to identify and evaluate the role of specific strains, including HRV-C, in the activity of chronic asthma. For example, a recent study detected HRV-C in almost half of all children who were hospitalized with rhinovirus-associated respiratory illnesses.9",

Our goals for this study were to prospectively evaluate the contribution of HRV to seasonal asthma disease activity, and to compare the clinical characteristics of viral and non viral illnesses.

This study adds new information about patterns of the different species of rhinovirus, including the newly defined HRV-C. One of the unique features of this study is that we evaluated children with asthma during peak cold seasons irrespective of whether they were having asthma and/or cold symptoms. As expected, HRV infections were major contributors to cold and asthma symptoms; however, correlations between viral infections and illness were not absolute. Clearly, non viral factors also contributed to upper and lower airway symptoms in these children, and many infections (24%) were asymptomatic. Comparison of viral to non viral illnesses demonstrated that viral illnesses lasted longer, were more severe, and were more likely to be associated with loss of asthma control.

It is of particular interest that there was an extensive diversity of HRV strains detected in one community over the three-year study period. Almost all of the strains detected each season were new (72-100%) and no one strain was detected in more than two collection periods. These findings are in substantial agreement with early studies of HRV epidemiology that used culture alone to detect HRV strains, 16, 17 and add new information about patterns of newly defined HRV species. Although the strains varied from season-to-season and year-to-year, the species clustered into a pattern: HRV-A in the spring, HRV-B in the fall, and HRV-C in both seasons. This pattern is different than what has been reported in a previous study of hospitalized children with asthma where HRV-C appeared to predominate in the fall.9 Given the high rate of change, a longer period of evaluation will be needed before any firm conclusions can be reached regarding seasonality of HRV species.",

In fact, viral detection was not always associated with cold and/or asthma symptoms; both symptoms were also found during virus negative weeks. On the other hand, there was a positive correlation between viral infection and asthma symptom severity. In addition, we found that viral illnesses were more severe with longer duration of cold and asthma symptoms and more loss of asthma control compared to non viral illness. These findings suggest that viral infections are closely associated with more significant cold and asthma symptoms, and that a combination of viral and non viral factors may be necessary to produce more severe symptoms.",

Over two-thirds of our subjects were sensitized to at least one allergen tested; those who were sensitized had the same number of infections but experienced 47% more viral respiratory illnesses with increased severity of both cold and asthma symptoms compared to the non-sensitized children. Furthermore, the non-sensitized children were more likely to experience asymptomatic infections. This would not have been apparent without routine sampling of nasal secretions. The results are consistent with observations in previous studies that have suggested that sensitization to aeroallergens is a significant risk factor, and may be critical, for severe viral illnesses. 10, 11, 18, 19 Furthermore, it has also been suggested that sensitization and allergen exposure or viral infection alone do not act as independent risk factors for an asthma hospitalization, rather only increase the risk in combination. 18 Since there are currently no effective antiviral treatments for common cold viruses, there is a need for clinical studies to determine whether controlling allergic inflammation is an effective strategy for reducing the risk of severe virus-induced asthma symptoms in allergic individuals.",

Of the many HRV strains moving through a community in any given month, many strains were associated with loss of asthma control, including the newly discovered HRV-C species viruses. Additional studies are needed to determine whether there are specific characteristics of these viruses that promote wheezing and acute asthma. These data also show that respiratory illnesses associated with viruses are more severe and of longer duration, and provide further evidence of interactions between allergy and virus-induced respiratory morbidity. Understanding the mechanisms for these interactions may be the key to designing novel and more effective treatments or preventive strategies for virus-induced exacerbations of asthma.",
