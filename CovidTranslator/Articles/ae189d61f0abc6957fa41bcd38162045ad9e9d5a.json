In this study, a large-scale recombinant DNA plasmid containing a designed HIV-1 multi-epitope-p24 chimeric gene was prepared and purified. Rhesus monkeys were then inoculated muscularly with the plasmid for four times in week 0, 4, 8 and 18. Whole blood was collected two weeks after the third and fourth inoculation, followed by serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) separation. The CTL activity and proliferation of PBMCs stimulated by macaque MHC-I-restricted HIV-1 CTL epitope peptide were analyzed by MTT and LDH release assay, respectively. Th1 cytokines in supernatant of cultured PBMC stimulated by HIV-1 CTL epitope peptide and anti-HIV-1 antibody in serum were assayed by ELISA. The results showed that increased CTL target-killing activity, higher secretion of Th1 cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2) and promoted proliferative reaction of monkey PBMCs stimulated by HIV-1 CTL epitope peptide were detected in the immunization group inoculated by the recombinant DNA vaccine for three times, which were further enhanced by the fourth inoculation. At the same time, HIV-1 specific antibody in serum of immunized monkeys was higher than that in controls. We concluded that the designed HIV-1 DNA vaccine may induce HIV-1 specific cellular and humoral immunity on monkeys.",

The HIV-infected population in China is estimated to be about 840000 and the infection ratio in the population is 0.07% currently. There were 29623 more newly infected persons from the end of 2003 to September of 2004 in China [1] . It will be over 10 millions of HIV infections by the year of 2010 in China if there are no interventions to control the spread of HIV/AIDS, and great loss in economy and lots of social problems would appear consequently. As estimated by ref. [1] , at least 3.1 billion RMB were spent in the HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment only in the year of 2004 in China.",

            "text": "It is of great importance to find out an effective way to restrain the epidemic of HIV/AIDS. Fortunately, more and more work has been done recently. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is playing great roles in prolonging the life of AIDS patients [2, 3] , especially in the short term clinic treatment [4] . However, their benefits are limited by problems of both long-term usage which causes resistance to the drugs and expensive price which a majority of infected patients find hard to pay. These realities urge scientists develop and test alternative forms of treatment. Several liveattenuated vaccines aiming at HIV have been tested on animals [5] [6] [7] [8] , but the risk of virus mutant or virulent regaining makes them undesirable. DNA vaccines, possessing the advantages of safety, low cost of production and easiness of use in field conditions, have become a hot spot in the field of HIV vaccines development in recent years. Singh and his colleagues [9] constructed a DNA vaccine by deleting the reverse transcriptase gene from SHIV genome. The results of immunization on six macaques showed that three out of four immunized animals survived, while the two controls died. It is suggested that DNA vaccine could prevent AIDS and could be used alone in large-scale immunization programs without the need for boosting with viral proteins.",

Epitope selection can be biased toward those that are most highly conserved among viral types and subtypes, as well as dominant or subdominant epitopes from numerous viral products. Strategies in HIV vaccine design [18] [19] [20] were specifically concentrated on consensus sequences of prevalent HIV-1 types either within specific populations or the local target population. In a former study [14] , we first scanned the whole sequence of HIV-1 and picked out several highly conserved and predominant epitopes. We further optimized the codons and the arrangement of these epitope genes and constructed the designed gene to a DNA vaccine vector. The results of the immunization with the recombinant plasmid on mice showed that the antigen expressed from the designed gene had a good immunogenicity.",

Similarly, detections on clinical longterm nonprogressors [23] [24] [25] [26] infected by HIV-1 demonstrated the presence of low viral loads, slower decrease in CD4 + T lymphocyte counts and broad CTL immune responses, supporting the notion that CTL responses may help to curb viral replication in these chronically HIV-1-infected individuals. Virus-specific CTL responses induced by epitope vaccines can constrain SIV replication and prevent disease progression either under the SIV infection or in pathogenesis model with rhesus monkeys or pathogenic strains of the hybrid simian HIV-1 [27] [28] [29] [30] . The effectiveness of CTL responses on the control of virus replication and disease progression was further clarified by the findings [31] [32] [33] [34] that SIV virus mutated to dominant CTL epitopes could escape CTL recognition, resulting in an increase in viral replication and acceleration of disease progression. We determined the target-killing activity of macaques immunized with the designed DNA vaccine by LDH assay. The results showed that the target-killing activity of CD8 + CTL in PBMCs of immunized macaques, under the stimulation of macaque MHC-I-restricted CTL epitope peptide, approached 35% and 10% in the high and low ratio of effector cell to target cell respectively, suggesting that the designed DNA vaccine may induce the production of HIV-1-specific CTL in macaques.",

Studies on highly risk population for HIV [38] [39] [40] showed that those whose HIV antibody and RNA were detected to be negative bore strong Th1 responses. Further observations on HIV-infected patients without clinical symptoms [38] [39] [40] demonstrated that those who did not progress to AIDS possessed permanent and dominant Th1 responses, while those who progressed to AIDS exhibited a gradually decreased production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 but a gradually increased production of IL-4 and IL-10. These researches indicated that Th1 responses may play key roles in either the prevention of HIV infection or delaying the progression of HIV infections. In this study, the designed DNA plasmid was observed to induce significantly high production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 from cultured PBMCs under the stimulation of HIV-1 CTL epitope peptide, thus suggesting that the designed vaccine can enhance Th1 responses on macaques.",

In addition, we observed enhanced immune responses induced by the fourth immunization, indicating that immune responses can be promoted by the same antigen based on the prime immunization with proper interval between immunizations.",
