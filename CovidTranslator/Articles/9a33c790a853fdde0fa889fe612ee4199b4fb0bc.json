            "text": "funding in a research and data infrastructure limits the ability to identify weaknesses and learn from mistakes.\" 3 On Oct. 18, 2014 , the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care designated 12 centres across the province of Ontario, Canada, as Ebola patient care sites, including The Ottawa Hospital, an academic tertiary centre. When The Ottawa Hospital received this designation, it was quickly recognized that the current system and practices of providing critical care were likely insufficient to meet the demands of caring for these patients. Past experiences with caring for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 revealed numerous challenges in the provision of critical care and highlighted the importance of planning and preparedness. 4, 5 We therefore decided to embark on a needs assessment, which compares \"what should be\" done to \"what is\" done. A need or gap is defined as a discrepancy between what is and what should be done. 6 In this article, we present the results of a rigorous and rapid interdisciplinary needs assessment conducted at a tertiary hospital to clearly identify the desired results (\"what should be\" done), gaps in current practice, and the barriers and facilitators to the development of solutions. The scope of the needs assessment was bounded to include any aspects of critical care related to suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola. This needs assessment was performed under the assumption that we would have only a small number of suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola. If the number of cases were to be greater, the plan would require reassessment and revision.",

An interdisciplinary needs-assessment team was formed, and key stakeholder groups were identified. Data collection and analysis were ongoing throughout the study in an iterative process (Table 1) .",

The line of inquiry initially began open-ended and progressively became semistructured. Mental simulation, low-fidelity simulation and flow-mapping techniques were used to help participants describe and then visualize various patient scenarios. Raw data were captured in field notes and then reviewed and processed. Through the needs-assessment period, there was also an \"open door\" policy, whereby anyone (e.g., nurses, physicians, respiratory therapists, housekeeping staff and infection control staff) were encouraged to approach the needs-assessment team at any time.

These criteria were then applied in the selection of a new Ebola room. Subsequently, after numerous interviews and walk-throughs, a new room was identified that met the selection criteria.

In collaboration with the facility team, the computer, shelves and built-in desk were removed and the room repainted. Hazard tape was trialed in various configurations to best define clean and contaminated areas to optimize usage of the room by all key stakeholders (i.e., doffing practices and waste removal) (Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj open.ca/content/3/2/E198/suppl/DC1).",

A transport process was iteratively developed through many walk-throughs with key stakeholders. Each step was carefully explored.

It is imperative that we are clear on our terminology in terms of actions. That is, it is essential to differentiate between standards, guidelines and recommendations. The term \"standard\" represents any definitive rule, principle or measure established by authority and may not be subjected to individual changes, therapeutic or diagnostic modifications. In contrast to standards, guidelines define the present quality of treatment, but are sufficiently flexible to allow rapid changes if these are required. Recommendations are still further removed from a rigid set of standards to be referred to for advice on a course of treatment. 32 Of the many standard-setting processes reviewed, we found the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Space Flight Health Standards-Setting Process (2007) to be exemplary and closest to the approach taken here. 33 Hallmarks of NASA's standard-setting processes include an approach that is evidence-based, open and transparent (all interested parties have input into the process), well documented (trail of decision-making process), well informed (experts, decision-and policy-makers) and dynamic (iterative and ongoing). 33, 34 A thorough literature review is the starting point of any standards-setting process and should encompass the relevant literature. Our process included a compilation of existing standards (e.g., guidelines and protocols released by the WHO, CDC and Emory Healthcare). Guidelines from CCCS, CAEP, AMMI Canada, the Ministry of Health and Long-term Care of Ontario, and relevant local-level hospital documents were collated and refined into a single document (Appendix 1).

They surveyed 102 physicians and identified 2 core themes with respect to problems with pandemic management: coordination and resource-related difficulties. Their qualitative analysis suggested that \"most difficulties experienced during [pandemic] H1N1 were related to coordination of response between stakeholders.\" 36 The Roundtable on Healthcare and Emergency Service Sector Pandemic Preparedness reported that a top-down approach is essential in emergencies management, but that a bottom-up method of feedback is also needed to allow adaptation to varying circumstances. 36, 37 By performing a comprehensive needs assessment involving all key stakeholder groups, we merged these 2 approaches, facilitating communication and collaboration between leaders and front-line hospital team members, strengthening the overall result, enhancing buy-in to solutions and producing a transparent process.",

However, at the local level, ensuring adequate separation was constrained by the physical layout of the rooms, because the facilities were not originally designed to meet this requirement.
