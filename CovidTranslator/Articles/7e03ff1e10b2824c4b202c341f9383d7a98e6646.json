This region is also known as the 'five prime untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR)' (Figure 1) .

Leader sequences have the propensity for form ing secondary structures (stem-loops) by base pairing of complementary sequences. In prokaryotes, the leader sequences are usually short. In eukaryotes and viruses, the leader sequences may vary from few nucleotides to several hundred nucleotides. It usually contains the site for ribosome binding. At times, the leader sequence may be translated into a short-leader peptide, which can affect the transcription of the rest of the mRNA.",

Nucleotide sequences within the leader cause the formation of a domain of secondary structure which acts as a tran scription termination signal for bacterial RNA polymerase. Transcription initiated in the upstream promoter terminates within the leader so as to prevent RNA polymerase from entering the structural genes of an operon. Transcription ter mination is relieved when the intracellular concentration of the end-product amino acid of the operon-specified enzymes falls below some minimal level. The level of the end-product amino acid is sensed by the translation of a short leader-encoded open reading frame (ORF) immediately upstream of the transcription termination signal; the ORF contains one or more codons for the operon end-product amino acid. Low intracellular levels of the end-product amino acid prevent high-level charging of the cognate transfer RNA (tRNA), resulting in ribosomal pausing at leader codons for the end-product amino acid. The paused ribosome inter feres with the secondary structure of the transcription terminator causing the formation of a second configuration in the mRNA, the attenuator, which allows transcription to enter the downstream operon-coding sequence.",

A domain of second ary structure in leader mRNA sequesters the ribosome-binding site for the downstream resistance determinant, preventing translation initiation. Antibiotic-induced ribosome stalling in a short ORF within the leader causes destabilization of the secondary structure, which frees the ribosome-binding site allowing translation of a coding sequence whose protein pro duct can neutralize the antibiotic. Translational repression is well exemplified by certain oper ons encoding bacterial ribosomal proteins. The translational repressor is a single ribosomal protein encoded by the operon; the nonregulatory function of this protein is to act as a struc tural component of the ribosome. In several examples, the binding target for the repressor protein in the operon leader sequence mimics the structure or sequence of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) target for the same protein. Binding of the regu latory protein to leader mRNA is presumably of lower affinity than that for rRNA binding in vivo. Leader binding by the repressor interferes with translation of operon mRNA by occluding the ribosome-binding site or by changing the sec ondary structure of leader.",

There are two related cytoplasmic iron-regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) that bind to this element. Under conditions of iron deprivation, these proteins bind to the IRE and block the binding of transla tion preinitiation complex, which inhibits translation of downstream ORF. Under conditions of iron plentiful, these proteins undergo posttranslational modifications that cause inactivation and degradation by proteosome.

These long 5\u2032 UTRs give the propensity for formation of stable secondary structure that may inhibit translation initiation by blocking the progress of the scanning ribosome. These structured mRNAs are particu larly dependent on the activity of the cap-dependent unwinding machinery for their translation.

The 5\u2032 UTR of all picorna virus genomes contains IRES that directs cap-independent internal initiation of protein synthesis. The 5\u2032 UTR present in all of the late adenovirus mRNAs are termed 'tripartite leader sequence (TPL)'. TPL is formed by the splicing of three exons. TPL facilitates mRNA transport and accumulation in the cytoplasm and is responsible for the selec tive translation of the late viral proteins in preference to the cellular proteins. All of the coronavirus mRNAs contain iden tical leader sequences, which are derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA. Coronavirus leader RNA regulates and initiates mRNA transcription. The 5\u2032 leader sequence of retrovirus RNA is involved in a variety of functions that include RNA elonga tion, RNA splicing, protein translation, genomic RNA dimerization and packaging, and initiation of reverse transcrip tions.
