In our patient the ultramicroscopic changes were very marked and are therefore difficult to ascribe to the gastroenterostomy. Since the virus-containing vesicles were only found in degenerating cells, it would seem reasonable to ascribe the cell damage to the presence of the virus.

Careful review of previously collected electron micrographs from this study has revealed similar vesicles with coronavirus-like particles in biopsies from three of twelve patients with classical chronic tropical sprue ( Figure 4 ) and also in one unpublished patient with a sprue-like syndrome associated with agammaglobulinemia. In view of the difficulty of finding the virus-like struc-tures in some of the biopsies from the present case, it seems probable that a more thorough search of multiple sections of biopsies from south Indian patients with tropical sprue may reveal a higher percentage of cases with ultramicroscopic evidence of coronavirus-like particles in the damaged enterocytes. Although much further work remains to be done, these findings support Manson-Bahr's hypothesis (30) and the accumulating epidemiological evidence (31) that at least one cause of the syndrome of tropical sprue (32) is a viral infection of the enterocytes.",

In a review of electron micrographs, similar structures were found in biopsies from three of 12 patients with classical chronic tropical sprue and in one patient with a sprue-like syndrome associated with agammaglobulinaemia. The hypothesis is advanced that infection with this virus may produce enterocyte damage and may be one cause of the syndrome of tropical sprue.",
