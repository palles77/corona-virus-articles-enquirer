            "text": "This article investigates the dispersion of airborne pollutants emitted from different locations near a high-rise building. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for simulating the wind flow field and the pollutant dispersion was developed and validated by wind tunnel data. Then the spreading of the pollutant emitted from different locations to a rectangular-shaped high-rise residential (HRR) building was numerically studied. The pollutant source location was set in a wide range of the position angle and distance between the source and the building. It was found that the pollutant concentration on the building decreases with an increase in the emission distance whereas the effect of the position angle is more complicated. Interestingly, there is a critical range of the position angle from which the emitted pollutants will not spread to the building in a significant way. The effect of the source location was linked to the wind flow field around the building, particularly with several major flows. The vertical distributions of the pollutant concentration on different faces were also investigated, and it was found that these are more affected by the vertical flow near each face. Finally, a mathematical model was developed to evaluate the pollutant concentration as a function of the emission distance and position angle. These findings are helpful to the understanding of the dispersion of airborne pollutants around high-rise buildings and the related hazard management in urban design. et al. / Applied Mathematical Modelling 81 (2020) 582-602 583 Rising reports of such outbreaks have attracted scientific attention on understanding the spreading of airborne hazards in urban areas, which is helpful for the prediction and control of the outbreak of airborne diseases for public health [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

Additionally, the spreading of pollutants around and inside such buildings is more complex as a result of strong windstructure interactions and diverse spreading scenarios. Pollutants may be emitted from an HRR building (e.g. from a kitchen exhaust) and spread to the same building at different positions [13 , 14] , like the possible SARS spreading in typical HRR buildings in Hong Kong [15] [16] [17] . Pollutants may also be released from sources located around a HRR building at lower levels [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , such as the evaporative facilities (e.g. cooling tower or air scrubber) of public facilities, which have been responsible for reported disease outbreaks [23] [24] [25] . Accordingly, the position of the potential pollutant source is an important factor in evaluating the risk of the spreading of pollutants near an HRR building, but it has not been fully evaluated in terms of the distance and the position angle between the source and the building.",

Wind tunnel is a valuable tool in studying such pollutant dispersion under controllable wind flow and weather conditions [14 , 26-28] . However, detailed information, such as the flow field, is difficult to obtain from wind tunnel experiments, even with the most advanced techniques such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) [29] . Therefore, numerical models based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have been increasingly used to assist physical experimental studies. Such CFD models need to be carefully calibrated for specific problems, especially when considering the turbulence model and boundary conditions [30] . With the increasing of CFD studies in recent years, several effort s have been made to establish standard procedures for the accurate CFD simulation of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) in wind tunnels [31] [32] [33] . The choice of turbulence model in a CFD model normally needs to consider the balance between prediction accuracy and computational effort, which could be different for different problems investigated. It has been shown that Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models are capable of predicting accurate pollutant dispersions in 2D and 3D urban models [34] [35] [36] .",

However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive studies have been conducted on the effect of the pollutant source location on the spreading of pollutants to a nearby highrise building. This paper contributes to filling this gap using a numerical model. The model was validated by good agreement with the measured data in a wind tunnel experiment on the pollutant dispersion around a high-rise building [28] . Then the model was used to investigate the spreading of pollutants from a wide range of emission locations around a building. From the numerical simulations, the pollutant concentrations on different faces and levels of the building were quantified and analyzed in connection with the wind flow field. The correlation between the pollutant concentration and the pollutant source location was studied. Based on that, a mathematical model was established, which can help assess the risk of pollutant dispersion from different regions around a building in an overall picture. These results are helpful in the planning and risk management of urban HRR buildings.",

Re -entry is a cul-de-sac design in order to accommodate a window/opening for all rooms to comply with the Hong Kong building code. Pollutant emission from an exhaust on the building was studied in a series of wind tunnel experiments [28] . The Reynolds number based on the building's height (ReU H H/ \u03bd) exceeds the suggested value of 15,0 0 0 to ensure that the measurements were independent of Re and the reduced-scale model can be reliably used [42] . The dimensions of the building model and wind properties were extracted from the boundary layer wind tunnel test and used for the validation of the numerical model. Additionally, a generic rectangular-shaped building was also modelled, which has the same outer profile as the cruciform-shaped building with the ratio between the height H, breadth B and depth D given by H:B: D = 1:0.98:1.04, as shown in Fig. 1 . Note the cruciform-shaped building model was used mainly for the validation of the numerical model as it was used in the wind tunnel experiment. The flow domain considered in the numerical model is illustrated in Fig. 2 . Although some guidelines recommend the maximum blockage ratio for wind tunnel modelling can be as high as 10% [32] , a blockage ratio smaller than 3% is normally recommended for modelling the hypothetic open terrain [43] to prevent an artificial acceleration of the flow around the building, and there are recommendations for the blockage E.

Therefore, a remedy is recommended to improve the turbulence model utilizing specified source terms in the transport equations of k or \u03b5 [56 , 57] and implement Non-Linear Eddy Viscosity models (NLEV) for the disturbed flow within the Building Influence Area (BIA) [58] . To realize this remedy, we implemented the method proposed by Parente et al. [56] by including a source term in \u03b5 transport equation and treating C \u03bc differently for disturbed and undisturbed flows.",

Wind tunnel parameters and details of conducted experiments can be found in the reference [28] . The numerical model, with the mentioned boundary conditions in the previous section, generated a turbulent boundary layer flow. Using the wind velocity (3.27 m/s) at the building height (1 m), the friction velocity, u * \u2248 0.188 m/s, was obtained from Eq. (1) and applied to give the turbulent dissipation rate at the inlet boundary condition. The measured wind profiles (wind velocity and turbulent intensity) at the position of the building in the empty wind tunnel experiments were used as the inlet boundary condition in the numerical model. The atmospheric boundary layer should be horizontally homogenous both upstream and downstream of the domain [31] , which means that the flow characteristics in different sections along the wind stream should agree with each other. This is a critical part of establishing a valid computational model and it was achieved through calibrating the wall functions and the boundary layer mesh together. The standard k \u2212\u03b5 model was improved by using User Defined Functions (UDF) in FLUENT to adjust the wall function parameters ( k S and z 0 ) simultaneously and employing the improved turbulence model within and outside of the BIA, a set of parameters was finally determined to satisfy the agreement between the simulated wind profile and experimental data, in terms of both velocity and turbulent intensity. In Fig. 3 the experimental wind profiles utilized at the domain's inlet ( x = \u22125 H ) as boundary condition are compared with the simulated ones in the downstream part of the domain ( x = 14 H ) near the outlet of the numerical domain for both cubic and cruciform shaped buildings. It can be seen that the improved k -\u03b5 model predicted much better results than the standard k -\u03b5 in order to replicate homogenous ABL flow along the wind stream.",

In the experimental study [28] , air with 99,0 0 0 ppm (10%) propane was released with a flow rate of 58.5 ml/s from the locations within the re-entry on different floors, as shown in red in Fig. 1 . The same conditions were set in the numerical model, and the simulated pollutant concentrations on different floors were compared to the experimental data [28] and previous numerical simulations [17 , 50] . Fig. 4 (a) and (b) show normalized pollutant concentrations for windward and leeward emissions respectively, in terms of the commonly used normalized concentration K C , given by [19 , 28 , 50] : where C is the mean pollutant concentration, U H is the wind speed at the building model height ( H ), S are the areas of the windward, side and leeward faces which can be approximated by H 2 for our studied building with nearly uniform dimensions, and Q is the volumetric flow rate of emitted pollutant. The measured normalized concentration in Fig. 4 is area weighted average on the surface of the building in the same re-entry in which pollutant is emitted. Fig. 4 shows that the predicted K C as a function of the floor level was in good quantitative agreement with the experimental results and previous CFD simulations. In particular, the features of the migrating pollutants resulting from the wind flow were captured. For example, in Fig. 5 (a) , the simulated flow shows a stagnation point on the 6th floor of the building's windward face in the re-entry. Thus, Fig. 4 (a-1) shows that K C was higher in the first three floors when the emission point was located below the stagnation point on the 3rd level in the re-entry, and the pollutant pathway was mainly downward. However, when the source was on the 6th floor, K C decreased with the vertical distance from the source and increased in both the upward and downward directions, as shown in Fig. 4 (a-2) . This was due to the downwash and upwash effects happening near the releasing point pushing the pollutant vertically in both directions. If the pollutant was emitted from the 9th floor, following the flow streamlines it would mainly travel upwards, affecting the higher levels and passing over the top of the building. As a result, as illustrated in Fig. 4 (a-3) , the concentrations on the 9th and 10th floors were high, while those on the lower levels were almost negligible.",

The effects of \u03b8 and r on the distribution of K C on different faces and levels of the rectangular-shaped building, as a generic model, were analyzed, and a mathematical model was proposed at the end of the section. Fig. 6 shows the normalized pollutant concentration on the windward, side and leeward faces of the building as a function of \u03b8 with different emission distances. As illustrated in Fig. 6 (a) , for the windward face, K C was the highest at \u03b8 = 0 \u00b0, then decreased rapidly to almost zero as \u03b8 increased to approximately 30 \u00b0. With the increase of r , the maximum K C at \u03b8 = 0 \u00b0decreased. For the side face, as shown in Fig 6 (b) , K C had two peaks at a \u03b8 \u2248 0 \u00b0and \u03b8 \u2248 180 \u00b0, whereas the location of the first peak moved to a higher value and that of the second to a lower value with the decrease of r . On the other hand, K C was very small between two critical angles [ \u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 ], while the values of \u03b8 1 and \u03b8 2 were dependent on r . As depicted in Fig 6 (c) , K C on the leeward face also had two peaks near \u03b8 \u2248 0 \u00b0and \u03b8 \u2248 180 \u00b0, respectively. However, the first peak was rather low while the second peak very high. Also, similar to the side face, there was a range of angle between two critical values [ \u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 ], in which K C was very small. The critical angles were different from those for the side face, and they were also dependent on r. Generally, Kc on the leeward face was much higher than on other faces when \u03b8 was close to 180 \u00b0.",

            "text": "It can be seen that K C approached zero in the interval of \u03b8 bounded by two critical values of \u03b8 1 and \u03b8 2 . As the two angles are different for different faces and emission distances, conservatively the intersection set of these intervals is a relatively safe region for the location of facilities which are potential pollutant sources. In other words, if the pollutant outbreaks in such a region, K C on all faces of the building will always be very small; whereas if the outbreak occurs out of this region, the building will be significantly attacked on at least one of its faces. Note here only half of the region was considered while the other half was supposed to be symmetric. Fig. 7 . If the pollutant spreads out from the first region ( \u03b8 \u2208 [0 \u00b0, \u03b8 1 ]), it will mainly affect the windward face of the building as the air mainly flows to the windward face. However, since the air will flow over the side face with the separation reattachment, a certain amount of the pollutant may be carried to and deposit on the side face. The remainder of the pollutant not depositing on either the windward or the side face is carried to the lee of the building and may be dragged to the leeward face due to the recirculation flow there. The amount of the pollutant to be carried to the side and leeward faces is dependent on how close the pollutant source is to the building. If the pollutant enters the side region through a closer location to the building, it will more likely pollute the side face. Also, if the pollutant carried by the wind flow exits closer to the side of the building and enter the lee, it is more likely to be trapped in the wake at the lee of the building.",

            "text": "When the pollutant source is located in the third region ( \u03b8 \u2208 [ \u03b8 2 , 180 \u00b0]), pollutant will be released inside or close to the recirculation zone at the lee of the building. Hence the pollutant can be dragged to the leeward face or even to the side face. As the pollutant source is closer to the building and the center of the recirculation zone ( \u03b8 = 180 \u00b0), the likelihood of pollutant becoming trapped in the wake at the lee of the building increases. Accordingly, \u03b8 2 gets closer to 180 \u00b0and the interval of [ \u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 ] narrows as r increases. When the pollutant source is located in the second region ( \u03b8 \u2208 [ \u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 ]), the pollutant is carried by the wind flow without any deposition on the side face of the building as the emission point is not sufficiently close to the building. The pollutant carried to the leeward region also does not enter the recirculation flow, so it travels to the downstream part of the domain without any deposition on the leeward face of the building. The effect of r on the pollutant concentration on different faces of the building is shown in Fig. 8 . Here some typical position angles were used, according to the regions identified in Fig. 7 . Generally, it can be seen that K C decreased with r at any angle and for any face of the building and approaches almost zero at certain large r . When the pollutant was released from the first region ( \u03b8 \u2208 [0 \u00b0, \u03b8 1 ]), the pollutant concentration decreased smoothly with an increase of r on all the faces, as shown in Fig. 8 (a), (b-1) and (c-1). However, K C was strongly dependent on the combination of r and \u03b8 when the pollutant source location was in the third region ( \u03b8 \u2208 [ \u03b8 2 , 180 \u00b0]), as shown in Fig. 8 (b-2) and (c-2). Such complicated combined effects of r and \u03b8 are due to the recirculating bubbles formed on the vertical and horizontal planes in this region, as shown in Fig. 9 . When the pollutant source is situated closer to the center of the bubble and closer to the building, there is more possibility for the pollutant to spread to the building before returning to downstream part of the flow field. Two additional cases at the emission distance of 2.5H and position angles of 0 \u00b0and 180 \u00b0were further considered and included in the figure. It is shown that for a larger r , if the pollutant was emitted from \u03b8 = 0 \u00b0, K C still decreased smoothly with the increase of r ; but if the pollutant was emitted from outside of the recirculation bubble ( \u03b8 = 180 \u00b0), Kc on the side face ( Fig. 8 (b-2) ) and leeward face ( Fig. 8 (b-c) ) approached almost zero as the pollutant cannot be returned back to building by the recirculation flow. This highlights the importance of the pollutant source location on the pollutant spreading, in partic- ular not only the distance but also the position angle, as the wind flow field will be very different near different building faces.",

Near the windward face of the building, there were strong downwash and upwash flows divided at the stagnation point as shown as arrow 1 in Fig. 11 (a) . The recirculating bubble near the leeward face, shown as arrow 2 also (a) in Fig. 11 (a) , generated an upwash flow vertically along the building. Near the side face, the flow was mainly lateral but not vertical as shown in Fig. 11 (b) . However, the separation reattachment along the windward corner and the side face, as shown as arrow 3 in Fig. 11 (c) , retained the pollutant on the side face. The downwash airflow near the windward face is responsible for the highest K C on the first level of the windward face, but this only applies to the pollutant emitted from the first region, as shown in Fig. 10 (a) . On the leeward face, when the pollutant was emitted from \u03b8 \u2208 [0 \u00b0, \u03b8 1 ], a small amount was carried to the lee of the building by the lateral flow and K C distributed evenly on the levels of the leeward face due to the vertical flow in the recirculation bubble as shown in Fig. 10 (c-1) . Such a vertical flow is more effective when the pollutant is emitted from \u03b8 \u2208 [ \u03b8 2 , 180 \u00b0]. The vertical flow near the side face is more complicated than those of the other two faces. There was no major vertical flow; however, the collisions of different flows generated local vertical flow. In particular, the lateral flow next to this face was affected by the upstream airflow coming from the windward region and the downstream airflow returning by the recirculation bubble from the lee of the building, which created local vertical flow only near the first level, as shown as arrow 4 in Fig. 11 (b) . Hence, under the combined effects of the local vertical flow and separation reattachment, the pollutant emitted from \u03b8 \u2208 [0 \u00b0, \u03b8 1 ] deposited more on the first to third levels of the side face, as shown in Fig. 10 (b-1) , whereas for the pollutant emitted from \u03b8 \u2208 [ \u03b8 2 , 180 \u00b0] a small fraction was returned to the side face by the recirculating flow and accumulated on the first level due to the local vertical flow, as shown in Fig. 10 (b-2) .",

As discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 , the pollutant concentration on the windward face is mainly affected by the downwash flow near the windward face of the building, therefore Eq. (12) contains one of these terms. On the other hand, the pollutant concentrations on the side and leeward faces are mainly controlled by the lateral flow in the side region and the recirculating flow in the leeward region, hence K C is more effectively modelled as a superposition of two such terms in Eqs. (13) and ( 14 ) , and shows two relative maximum points. These maximum points decrease with the increase of emission distance and approach to zero after certain distances. Note this model is a basic one to consider the effect of the emission source location, which can be improved to include other factors.",

It is found that a similar mathematical model can also be proposed for this complicated building. K C distributions on the windward, side and leeward faces as a function of the emission location ( r & \u03b8 ) can be given by Eqs. (15) , (16) and (17) , respectively. The R-squared between the predicted results and simulation data is above 0.95. These three equations are in the same forms as Eqs.

This indicates the terms a ( H r ) 2 \u00d7 exp ( b\u03b8 ) could be general in describing the effect of the emission location on the pollutant dispersion to a nearby building. Fig. 12 illustrates K C on different faces of the two buildings concluded from the CFD simulations and the proposed mathematical models. Firstly, the comparison between the CFD simulation and the mathematical model shows good agreement for the comprehensive range of the emission position. Secondly, the capability of such models for buildings with more complicated shapes is also illustrated by the example of the cruciform-shaped building. The mathematical models can also help to determine the critical angles \u03b8 1 and \u03b8 2 and thus a relatively safe zone around a HRR building. Note dimensionless parameters are used in the model; therefore the model includes the building height, wind speed and emission rate as can be seen in ( Eq. (11) ). Hence the generality of the model can be studied by varying these variables in the future.",

Such figures provide a direct visualization of the emission region that can generate certain pollutant concentration on a building face, which can be helpful for the related hazard management. For example, if K C > 0.01 is set as the unsafe threshold, the blue regions in the figures can be regarded as the safe regions for the pollutant emission source. The figures can also be used to directly compare the effect of the building shape on the pollutant dispersion. As shown here, the blue regions ( K C < 0.01) are similar for the windward and leeward faces of the two buildings, but different for the side face. These regions result from the complicated interactions among the wind, building and pollutant, which are more easily assessed in such overall views.",

The highest Kc was found on the leeward face when the emission location was at the lee of the building, resulting from the significant recirculation flow there. This work shows that CFD simulations combined with wind tunnel experiments are a cost-effective way to conduct comprehensive studies on pollutant dispersion in urban areas. With well-designed and controlled numerical simulations, the generated numerical data can be used to establish mathematical models for estimating the pollutant dispersion under given conditions. The results will help understand the spreading of airborne pollutants around high-rise buildings and the related hazard management in urban design. Index (GCI) proposed by Roache [65 , 66] was adopted in order to estimate the grid induced discretization error. For threedimensional calculations, the grid refinement factors are r 21 = N 1 / N 2 and r 32 = N 2 / N 3 where N is the total number of cells for the coarse ( N 3 ), medium ( N 2 ) and fine ( N 1 ) grids. Using the fixed-point iteration method, the apparent order p can be calculated as follows: GCI estimations are carried out for the normalized wind speed and kinetic energy along the vertical line, obtaining values comprised 0-5.8%. As representative results, GCI 21 fine = 0.18% and 3.1% are found for U X /U H and k/U H 2 at z/ H = 0.5, respectively. Fig. A2 (a) and (b) show the normalized streamwise wind speed and turbulent kinetic energy, respectively, along the vertical line. Fig. A2 (c) shows the 1.25 \u00d7 band of GCI for the basic grid solution. The grid-induced error band confirms the grid sensitivity is most pronounced for the lower heights. Nevertheless, based on these relatively small differences, the basic grid was utilized for further analysis in this study. ",

K C on the building is significant only when the pollutant source is located in the first and third regions. These regions are dependent on r and different for different faces. In the studied cases, a sector-shaped region around the building can be identified, in which the pollutant emission does not have a significant effect on the building. (3) In general, pollutant emitted from ground level accumulates on the lower levels of a high-rise building and decreases with increase of height. But at different faces, the vertical distributions of Kc will be affected by different vertical flows near the faces. (4) Based on the simulated data, a mathematical model was developed to estimate the overall pollutant concentration on a building face with the pollutant emitted from different locations. The mathematical model shows Kc can be modelled as the superposition of one or two terms in the form of a ( H r ) 2 \u00d7 exp ( b\u03b8 ) .Similar mathematical models can also be applicable to the cruciform-shaped building. The mathematical model can give a quantitative overview of the effect of the emission location.",

Using a UDF, a value of 3.5 was set for C S in order to satisfy k S < z p . The three grids are illustrated in Fig. A1 . For the three grids, the expansion ratios were all within 1 to 1.2 and the near wall y + within 30 to 300, which met the recommendations in the guidelines [32 , 64] . A grid sensitivity study was conducted for the normalized streamwise wind speed and turbulent kinetic energy on a vertical line at the distance of 0.25H from the lee of the building which is the most critical region due to the recirculation flow.
