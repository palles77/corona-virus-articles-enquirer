            "text": "In order to understand the spatio-temporal structure of epidemics beyond that permitted with classical SIR (susceptible-infectiverecovered)-type models, a new mathematical model for the spread of a viral disease in a population of spatially distributed hosts is described. The positions of the hosts are randomly generated in a rectangular habitat. Encounters between any pair of individuals are according to a Poisson process with a mean rate that declines exponentially as the distance between them increases. The contact rate allows the mean rates to be set at a certain number of encounters per day on average. The relevant state variables for each individual at any time are given by the solution of a pair of coupled differential equations for the viral load and the quantity of general immune system effectors which reduce the viral load. The parameters describing within-host viral-immune system dynamics are generated randomly to reflect variability across a population. Transmission is assumed to depend on the viral loads in donors and occurs with a probability p trans . The initial conditions are such that one randomly chosen individual carries a randomly chosen amount of the virus, whereas the rest of the population is uninfected. Simulations reveal local or whole-population responses. Whole-population disease spread may be in the form of isolated or multiple occurrences, the latter often being approximately periodic. The mechanisms of this oscillatory behaviour are analyzed in terms of several parameters and the distribution of critical points in the host dynamical systems. Increased contact rate, increased probability of transmission and decreased threshold for viral transmission, decreased immune strength and increased viral growth rate all increase the probability of multiple outbreaks and the distribution of the critical points also plays a role.",

More recently, certain parts of the world were thrown into panic and economic chaos by outbreaks of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in which certain new highly contagious strains of a type of corona virus were implicated. Global spread was facilitated by airline travel, and the number of cases doubled about every week in certain Asian countries in the early stages of this epidemic (Lipsitch et al., 2003; Anon., 2006b) . At the time of writing (early 2006) Western Europe is, as is the rest of the world, in the grip of the fear that \"bird flu\" (avian influenza H5N1) will move further west and its virus will mutate to a form which is easily transmitted from human to human, thus raising the threat of a global pandemic in which an estimated number of deaths as high as 180-360 million may occur (de la Barrera and Reyes-Teran, 2005; Osterholm, 2005) with economic costs in the US alone estimated at between 70 and 170 billion dollars.",

Examples of such systems with as many as 10 components applied to analysis of vaccination against carrier borne diseases are summarized in Anderson and May (1991) . The SIR approach, which is based on an assumption of homogeneous mixing of susceptible and infectious individuals, is used to make predictions in relation to both practical and theoretical aspects of epidemics and the spread of disease (see Diekmann and Heesterbeek (2000) , Hethcote (2000) , Pollard (1973) for reviews). However, such gross compartmental models do not allow for the inclusion of either the spatial distributions of the individual members of the population nor the detailed dynamics of the infecting particles (viruses or bacteria).",

Longini and coworkers Patel et al., 2005; Weycker et al., 2005) have included stochastic mechanisms and age groups in models for the spread of influenza in communities of total population 10,000, with a view to examining the effects of various vaccination schedules. Furthermore, large scale simulations for populations of many millions (EpiSims) based on realistic social networks (Eubank et al., 2004; Stroud et al., 2006) have highlighted the deficiencies contained in the homogeneous mixing assumption of the classical models.",

In previous publications (Tuckwell et al., , 2001 we have adopted this new approach to the spread of a disease using a set of dynamical variables which describe the disease states of individuals (animals or humans) through the size of the actual viral populations they harbor and components of the immune system. It is recognized that often there are many locations of viral populations in a single host, but these are considered together. We have considered a network of n > 1 hosts within each of which a viral population may establish itself and such that virus particles may be transmitted from any diseased host to another host. The model we will consider places emphasis on viruses as the disease-causing agent, but our approach may be also applied to bacterial diseases.",

Generally, there are agents in the immune system which, when stimulated by antigens, give rise to host defence mechanisms which are of several types, but whose net action is to eliminate the virus. Active defense mechanisms are lumped into effectors (Anderson and May, 1991, Ch. 3; Bocharov and Romanyukha, 1994) so that a simplified two-dimensional system of effectors and virus may be considered in each individual. Since the immune responses are specific to any particular virus, the use of a system of two differential equations to model the evolution of the virus-effector populations is a simplification but this approach is expected to contain the essential dynamics of the biological processes without rendering the system of equations unwieldy with a very large parameter set. Our approach can easily incorporate the \"standard model\" of viral dynamics in which there are three components, including uninfected T-cells, infected T-cells and virus particles (Neumann et al., 1998) , or other similar models (Wodarz et al., 2002) . However, this would require even more parameters so here we concentrate on the simplest comprehensive model and reserve extensions to later work. An article using our approach but with the inclusion of immunological memory has recently appeared (Kostova, 2007) .",

Here the matrix element \u03b2 ij , which may depend on several factors, describes the strength of transmission from host j to host i, and the function F, which in the simplest cases is linear, describes the overall effect of transmission to a host from the rest of the population. One usually takes \u03b2 ii = 0 for all i. In France, (and many other countries) data on influenza, and other diseases, are obtained from a preassigned group of general practitioners (500 of the approximately 50,000 in the whole country) who record the number of new cases of patients with \"flu-like symptoms\" and as such can be used to form a rough estimate of the actual numbers of cases. Records of the number of recorded cases of influenza (Anon., 2006a) show major roughly periodic outbreaks, which are probably attributable in part to seasonal effects (Lloyd and Jansen, 2004) , although the precise mechanisms involved are still not understood. One of the questions we wish to address in the present work concerns the nature and causes of periodic outbreaks. We wish to enquire whether \"epidemics\" may arise due to spatio-temporal stochastic processes in the transmission process. For example, if per chance a spatial cluster of diseased hosts occurs, there may ensue a local outbreak of considerable magnitude which may propagate to the rest of the population. We have already considered the effects of noise in individual responses and noted a broad-based stochastic resonance as the noise parameter changes in nonlinear models with threshold . We wish to investigate here and in subsequent studies the factors, both demographic and dynamical, which influence the frequency, magnitude and duration of various outbreaks.",

In order to take into account variability across the host population, the parameters r i , \u03b3 i , \u03bb i , \u03bc i and i are randomly distributed. All these parameters are nonnegative but in accordance with the most natural choice are given normal distributions (central limit theorem, Tuckwell, 1995) with means and standard deviations such that negative values have practically zero chance to occur-and in fact never did occur in any of the trials we have performed. The standard values of the means and standard deviations of these five parameters are shown in Table 1 , their units being as follows: \u03bb i , effectors days \u22121 ; \u03bc i , days \u22121 ; r i , days \u22121 ; \u03b3 i , effectors \u22121 days \u22121 ; and i , virions \u22121 days \u22121 . These values are based in part on (Anderson and May, 1991 ) and on our previous work (Tuckwell et al., , 2001 and are such that when they assume their mean values, the solutions of (5) and (6) in response to an initial small increase in viral load, are such that the viral load rises to a maximum after a few days and then declines to negligible values after about 10 days, while the effector level rises and remains at a higher level (immune memory); that is there are no oscillations. The actual magnitudes of the maximum viral loads are known in some cases where this is the form of the viral population growth curve, e.g. influenza in man (Bocharov and Romanyukha, 1994) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in mice (Bocharov, 1998) . In these references very complicated models (10 to over 40 differential equations) for viral and immune system dynamics have been given but we have employed a reduced system which captures the essence of the very large systems. The key variables (viral load and effector numbers) can be easily rescaled if required to actual biological values (Bocharov, 1998; Bocharov and Romanyukha, 1994; Neumann et al., 1998; Sidorenko, 2005) . For example, viral densities in influenza are of order 10 8 virus particles per millilitre of infected tissue (Sidorenko, 2005) and in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in mice, between 10 7 and 10 9 per millilitre (Bocharov, 1998) . In Fig.  2 is shown an example of the randomly distributed Table 1 . In the top part is shown the distribution for the P 1 's for each individual in the population and in the bottom part that for the P 2 's. Note that some of the latter are at unphysical values as they have negative values of the viral load -see Tuckwell and Wan (2000) for a detailed discussion -but this has no effect as the dynamical variables are constrained to have nonnegative values. Here the population is n = 100. positions of the critical points P 1 and P 2 in the (a,v)plane.",

For these results we have used the standard parameters with n = 100 and p trans = 0.2. The spatial distribution of hosts and the distributions of the critical points are those shown in Figs. 1-3 . Recall that only one member of the population is initially infected and that the individual responses are not oscillatory when the viral dynamical parameters take their standard mean values. However, due to the distribution of parameters several individuals may have recurrent outbreaks of diminishing magnitude. However, it was found that recurrent outbreaks in individuals were by themselves not intrinsically sufficient to cause another major outbreak because when the meetings between individuals were stopped at 50 days, there was just the initial outbreak even though all parameters and the spatial distribution were unchanged. In Fig. 5 is shown the temporal evolution of the viral loads in two of the individual hosts for the first outbreak in Fig.  4 . The blue curve, starting at v > 0 at t = 0, depicts the viral load for the initially infected individual, the (other) red curve being for an individual who became infected about 4-5 days later.

This assertion was verified by performing several simulations with only variations in the parameter \u039b-see Section 4.3 for related results. In order to understand which other factors might be primarily responsible for the occurrence of a multiplicity of outbreaks, we examined the nature of the critical points which are of the kind given in the scheme of Fig. 3 . If one or more members of the population have, for the critical point P 2 , asymptotically stable spiral points as opposed to nodes, one might expect that there is a chance that the resulting individual oscillatory activity could manifest itself in multiple outbreaks across the entire population. That is, recurrent epidemics might arise just because one or a few individuals have immune system parameters which lead to their having recurrent illness, which enables them to transmit virus particles to to others. However, it was found that recurrent outbreaks may occur in the population when there are just a few spiral P 2 's or if there are many. ",

With p trans = 0.4, 90% of trials gave recurrent outbreaks and when p trans was 0.5, all of the trials performed resulted in sustained oscillatory responses, of the kind depicted in Fig. 4 . For the second set of results periodic outbreaks were harder to elicit, as p trans had to be greater than 0.4 for them to occur at all. Examination of the spatial distributions for the two sets of results showed that for the first set, the initially infected individual was near the center of mass of the population whereas for the second set the initially infected individual was isolated at the periphery. Since the greater the distance between two individuals the smaller their rate of meeting, the position of the initially infected individual may have influenced the probability of multiple periodic outbreaks. (See Sidorenko (2005) for a discussion of related edge effects on the size and duration of epidemics.) It seems from these few results that stochastic mechanisms play a role in determining whether an epidemic consists of one major outbreak or whether there will be oscillations of the viral load across the population.",

Disease particles are transmitted stochastically from infected to other individuals. The novel feature of our model is that it includes dynamical systems for within-host disease particles (viruses or bacteria) and the host immune response. This has been done in a simple way by using a system of two differential equations which captures the elements of effector-viral or effector-bacterial dynamics. With the use of such models one may distinguish more accurately the spread of various diseases by using appropriate parameters. For example, models for HIV within-host dyamics are well documented (Neumann et al., 1998) and could be used in place of the simple model ( (5) and (6)) and could also be made stochastic (Le Corfec and Tuckwell, 1998; Merrill, 2005) .",

The number of parameters is thus very large. There are 10 fixed parameters given in Tables 2 and 3, n(n\u22121) 2 rates of contact, and 10n viral-immune system dynamical parameters-the latter being generated from the 5 means and standard deviations of each of the parameters in Table 1 for each member of the population. Thus each host has an assigned set of parameters so that different hosts will respond to disease agents in a different way. With such a large number of diverse parameters, it is not so simple to find the classically defined basic reproductive ratio R 0 (Anderson and May, 1991; Lloyd and Jansen, 2004) although a more detailed investigation could yield bounds on an estimate as in the large urban simulations (Eubank et al., 2004; Stroud et al., 2006) . We focussed on the occurrence or not of multiple approximately periodic outbreaks and investigated one or more of each class of parameter which seemed to play a role in determining whether single or multiple outbreaks would occur. For the simulations we performed, values of p trans below 0.3 never gave multiple outbreaks (see Table 4 ) whereas values equal to or greater than 0.5 could give multiple outbreaks. The parameter v crit was also investigated and found to exert considerable control over the multiplicity of outbreaks with a welldefined threshold effect. Another property investigated was population density, and since the area of habitat was fixed, it was sufficient to vary the population size n. The main influence of an increase in population density is, if the parameters \u039b and \u03b1 are left unchanged, to increase the contact rates between hosts. It was found that the probability of a single outbreak, as opposed to multiple outbreaks, dropped rapidly as the population density increased. Similarly, if the parameter \u039b increased there was an increase in the likelihood of a multiple outbreak. The natures of the population critical points was found to have some influence, but contact rates seemed to be the more important of these factors: if there were a few or many P 2 spiral points multiple outbreaks occurred if \u039b was large enough.",

First the mean of the intrinsic effector production rate, E[\u03bb i ] was varied to just above and below its standard value. Larger E[\u03bb i ] made it harder, but not impossible if \u039b increased, to elicit multiple outbreaks, reflecting stronger immune properties of the host population. Smaller values increased the likelihood of recurring illness across the population. Changes in the mean of r i , the withinhost viral production rate had the opposite effects to the corresponding changes in the mean of \u03bb i . In general, the the mean values of the within-host dynamical systems parameters have been based on a restricted set of values, so it remains to be seen what epidemic behaviour other sets of values will induce. In general such parameters, or their analogues in more detailed models, will be disease-specific. This could accommodate the fact that in some diseases, such as hepatitis C and chickenpox, virus particles persist within hosts for many years. The set of values concentrated on in this paper were based on our earlier work, where non-oscillatory solutions of the differential equations were sought to avoid recurrence of disease by virtue of individual dynamics as opposed to interactive effects.",

The path of the spread of infection could be followed graphically and with larger populations the existence of wave-like phenomena could thus be examined. One could examine the effects of randomly arriving disease-bearing immigrants on a population that has settled to an equilibrium situation with sub-threshold viral levels, described as a type (c) response at the beginning of Section 4. In addition, analysis could be performed on the effects of vaccination, quarantine and host deaths. Mutation of the virus to a more contagious form could also be studied by making the parameters p trans and the within host viral dynamical parameters take on new values for the members of the population who host the new mutant.",
