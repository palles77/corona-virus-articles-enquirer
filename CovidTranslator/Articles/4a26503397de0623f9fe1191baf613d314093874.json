            "text": "Rotavirus enteritis is the leading cause of diarrhea in infants worldwide. A research priority of the World Health Organization is to develop oral rehydration solutions containing amino acids or other additives that will stimulate intestinal absorption more efficiently than the current glucose-based oral rehydration solutions. Glutamine is the principal metabolic fuel of the small bowel and a putative stimulator of mucosal repair. This report describes the transport response to mucosal L-glutamine following intestinal injury caused by porcine rotavirus. Peak symptoms and mucosal damage were observed 2-7 days after oral rotavirus inoculation. In vitro transport studies of the maximally injured region, the midjejunum (80% reduction in lactase), surprisingly, showed transport responses to u-glutamine (30 mmoFL) and L-alanine (30 mmol/L) that were similar qualitatively and quantitatively to those observed in control tissue. Subsequent application of mucosal D-glucose (30 mmoFL) caused additional stimulation of electrogenic Na \u00f7 transport, but the response to glucose was blunted (P < 0.05) in the infected tissues. Glutamine and alanine enhanced Na + absorption to a similar degree (2-2.5 ~Eq-cm -z \u2022 h-l), but glutamine stimulated equal amounts of electrogenic and electroneutral NaCI absorption, whereas alanine had no significant effect on net C1-flux. Glutamine is a potentially useful substrate for investigation in oral rehydration solutions for infant diarrhea. V iral enteritis is the leading cause of diarrhea in infants and toddlers less than 2 years old (1) . Each year in the United States, about 22,000 infants are hospitalized for treatment of rotavirus-induced dehydration (2) . Central to the pathophysiology of diarrhea in one experimental model of viral enteritis, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), are the following intestinal abnormalities: impaired glucose and amino acidcoupled Na \u00f7 transport (3) (4) , defective NaC1 absorption (5) , diminished disaccharide hydrolysis (6) (7) (8) , and reduced mucosal absorptive surface (4, 8) . These abnormalities differ from those in enterotoxigenic diarrheas, in which C1-is actively secreted but mucosal surface area and Na\u00f7-coupled organic solute transport are preserved.",

Potential difference (PD) across the tissue was measured by calomel electrodes in saturated KC1, attached to agar bridges (4 g/dL, made up in Ringer's buffer) positioned near the surface of the tissue. The tissue was continuously short-circuited with automatic voltage clamps (World Precision Instruments, New Haven, CT), which compensated for the fluid resistance. Clamps introduced current to half-calls through Ag-AgCI electrodes which were connected to the chambers via agar bridges. All tissue sheets were mounted in the chambers within 30 minutes of the piglet's death and were continuously short-circuited, except for 5-second intervals every 20 minutes, when the open circuit PD was measured. Conductance (G) was calculated fTom the open circuit PD and short-circuit current (Isc) using Ohm's law.

This transmucosal absorption of C1in parallel with Na+ is an electrically silent (electroneutral) NaCl-absorptive response to glutamine.

In piglet models of diarrhea, the epithelium is dominated by crypt-type enterocytes, with villus blunting, increased specific activity of an enzyme involved in DNA replication (thymidine kinase), and significantly reduced brush border hydrolases and basolateral Na*,K\u00f7-ATPase activities. Infant mice infected with rotavirus appear to develop a much milder lesion (22, 23) . Biopsy data obtained from human infants suffering from rotavirus enteritis show abnormalities similar to the porcine lesion, although a spectrum of villus damage is seen (24) .

Na \u00f7 secretion persists in the absence of CI-, is associated with a residual flux, and is abolished in the nominal absence of HCO3, suggesting that pig jejunum secretes NaHCO3 in an electrogenic manner (25) .

Our data confirm that amino acid and glucose have combined effects .in enhancing Na \u00f7 absorption across the virus-damaged gut. Glutamine and alanine were equally effective in vitro stimulators of Na \u00f7 absorption in control and rotavirus-infected jejuna. Glutamine stimulates Na \u00f7 transport in newborn piglet proximal jejunum primarily by an electroneutral, rather than electrogenic Na\u00f7-coupled mechanism (12) ; serosal glutamine, we have found, will also increase NaC1 transport (12) . In the mid intestine, the current studies demonstrate that electrogenic glutamine-Na \u00f7 cotransport predominates over NaCI absorption. Although we have consistently observed a NaC1 absorptive response to glutamine, whether it is added to the mucosal or serosal sides of the tissue, we have shown that C1-absorption does not increase after mucosal phenylalanine or glucos.e. The latter two substrates, in pig jejunum, are transported solely by a Na\u00f7-coupled mechanism (12) .",

MacLeod and Hamilton found in coronavirusdamaged piglet small bowel that mucosal-to-serosal Na \u00f7 and C1-fluxes were low and could not be reduced further by furosemide or theophylline (5) . They speculated that jejunal epithelial cell NaC1 absorption may be absent in severe viral enteritis. One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy between our findings and theirs is that brush border NaC1 transport in TGE may be present but inhibited in the basal state. Transmucosal NaCI absorption could be inhibited by factors released in the subepithelium, such as immune cell mediators or neurotransmitters discharged from enteric nerves (27) . Mucosal glutamine may counteract this inhibition, by altering the metabolism of epithelial or lamina propria cells.",

If amino acid-Na \u00f7 cotransport is primarily carried out at the villus tip, as suggested by the autoradiographic studies of Smith (28) , one might have anticipated that the rotavirus-infected preparations would have responded poorly to glutamine and alanine. However, we observed a normal transport response in the infected jejunum (Table 4) .

The rapid intracellular metabolism of this important fuel by crypt-type cells could, in theory, stimulate the Na\u00f7,K \u00f7-ATPase and increase electrolyte absorption or could enhance L-glutamine-Na \u00f7 entry by preventing intracellular accumulation of the amino acid.",

Of possible concern regarding the use of L-alanine in the treatment of viral enteritis in infants is the observation that L-alanine \u2022 CI consistently increases Jsm (Tables 3 and 4 ). Although a statistically significant effect of alanine on net C1secretion across the mucosal barrier was not demonstrated in the current studies, L-alanine is a recognized activator of CI-channels in enterocytes (33) . Furthermore, in the ileum of newborn rabbits, a tissue with a much higher transmural conductance than piglet jejunum, alanine has no effect on Na \u00f7 absorption and significantly increases transepithelial C1secretion (34) . This finding is of concern if an oral rehydration solution (ORS) containing alanine and glucose are to be studied in infants. On the basis of these in vitro findings, we speculate that an ORS containing glutamine and glucose might be superior to conventional, glucose ORT in viral enteritis. Glutamine appears to be an effective stimula-tor of Na \u00f7 and NaCI transport in rotavirus-damaged jejunum.",
