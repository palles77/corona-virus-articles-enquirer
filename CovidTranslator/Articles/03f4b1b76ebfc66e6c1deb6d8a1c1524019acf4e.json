The animals should be protected from drafts and because they do not have efficient cooling mechanisms, and should never be placed in direct sunlight. Temperature and humidity must be monitored closely, as extremes and variations can cause stress and significantly contribute to disease susceptibility. Ventilation is another important factor, taking into consideration the size of the room, strain and sex of the animals, number of animals present, number of animals per cage, and sanitization interval. Ten to 15 complete air changes per hour should occur in facilities housing large numbers of animals in high-density situations, with fewer air exchanges being adequate for small numbers of pet rodents in private homes. If recycled air is used within a housing system, it should be HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filtered. Closed systems should be avoided, as they result in poor air circulation and a buildup of potentially toxic levels of ammonia and carbon dioxide. Ammonia gas reduces the diseaseresistance capabilities of the respiratory system. The metaplastic and ciliary inhibiting effects of ammonia can extend an innocuous upper respiratory infection into a bronchopneumonia. If an ammonia smell is detected with one's nose down at the level of the animal(s) in the cage, the level is too high for the occupants (Angela M. Lennox, DVM, Indianapolis, IN, personal communication, January 2010). Controversy remains on the minimal concentration of ammonia that is deleterious, but levels as low as 25 ppm increase the severity of Mycoplasma-induced lesions. 3 Other considerations of air quality might include factors such as dusts, fungal spores, disinfectant vapors, and environmental pollutants.",

Many respiratory infections are multifactorial, necessitating a thorough investigation. Fundamental diagnostic procedures and methodology employed for traditional species are readily adaptable to rodents. Early and accurate diagnosis can lead to more successful treatment strategies and formulation of a prognosis. All options should be presented because owners can form very strong bonds with these animals, especially rats. The practitioner must be cognizant that performing an examination or stressful diagnostic procedures could be detrimental; therefore in some cases supportive care must be instituted without the aid of diagnostics. Preemptive sedation to relieve anxiety and distress when appropriate can be beneficial to some animals. Procedures requiring anesthesia in the severely compromised animal must be carefully considered, especially when using inhalant anesthetics. Clinical pathology, microbiology, serology, parasitology, environmental screening, and Respiratory System Disease in Mouse, Rat, Hamster, and Gerbil surveillance testing can furnish pieces of the diagnostic puzzle. Necropsy and histopathology should be considered standard elements of the diagnostic plan, especially when epizootics occur. Cases submitted to one diagnostic laboratory typically fall into two general categories: (1) young, recently shipped animals for the pet trade and (2) older animals kept as pets (Drury Reavill, DVM, West Sacramento, CA, personal communication, August 2010). It is important to use a diagnostic laboratory familiar with the specific testing needs of these species and their pathogens. Several independent, commercial, and university-based diagnostic laboratories now offer an array of testing services as outlined in Table 1 . Imaging studies using plain radiography, contrast computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging comprise yet another diagnostic and, in some cases, prognostic tool.",

Very few drugs used in these species are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, which presents not only legal but therapeutic considerations, and similar restrictions may exist in other countries. It must be conveyed to the owner that treatment is not always curative and is ameliorative at best for some diseases. The use of particular antimicrobials administered orally, parenterally, or via nebulization can result in dysbiosis with subsequent fatal enterotoxemia. This side effect is seen most commonly in hamsters and gerbils and infrequently in mice and rats. Drugs that fall into this category are b-lactams, macrolides, and lincosamides. Aminoglycosides can cause an ascending flaccid paralysis with respiratory arrest, coma, and death in addition to its ototoxic and nephrotoxic potential. Neuropathological lesions in rats have been associated with nitrofurantoin. Examples of \"safe\" antibiotics are enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, marbofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfonamide combinations, tetracycline, doxycycline, azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, and chloramphenicol. However, even antibiotics considered safe can cause problems. Nebulization can be an adjunctive modality to administer with antimicrobials, bronchodilators (aminophylline), mucolytics (acetylcysteine), or mucokinetics (saline, F10) (Fig. 1) . The nebulizer must be capable of producing particle sizes smaller than 3 mm to reach the alveolar space. 4 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics can be administered if the animal seems to be in pain or discomfort. Corticosteroids are typically reserved for refractory cases. Numerous exotic animal formulary resources are available for specific drug dosages and contraindications. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Chloramphenicol has been associated with aplastic anemia in humans; therefore, appropriate client education with documentation must occur when prescribing this drug.",

The nostrils communicate internally via vestibules with the anterior nasal cavities, which are separated by a median septum. The sinuses are also divided by the median septum, and are highly developed olfactory organs containing 7 rows of turbinal bones. The nasopharynx forms the posterior part of the pharyngeal duct, lying dorsal to the soft palate and communicating with both the oropharynx and the Eustachian tubes. The intermediate section of the respiratory tract consists of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi, all of which have cartilaginous support. The larynx is formed by 3 single (epiglottis, thyroid, and cricoid) and 3 paired (arytenoids, corniculate, and cuneiform) cartilages. Incomplete cartilaginous rings support the walls of the trachea by branching and fusing with one another dorsally. The trachea branches into the left and right bronchi dorsal to the aortic arch. Extrapulmonary bronchi have complete cartilaginous rings, whereas intrapulmonary bronchi have no cartilaginous rings.

To accommodate for this high metabolic rate, the mouse has a rapid respiratory rate, short air passage, high alveolar PO 2 , moderately high erythrocyte concentration, high red blood cell hemoglobin and carbonic anhydrase concentrations, high capillary density, and high blood sugar concentration. The hemoglobin affinity for oxygen with changes in pH is more pronounced (Bohr effect). Mice also exhibit a slight shift in the oxygen-dissociation curve, enabling oxygen to be unloaded in the tissue capillaries at a high PO 2 . ",

            "text": "In the rat, 20-24 the external nares are shaped like inverted commas, open on the lateral aspect of the nose, and can be closed under water. The rat has several well-developed nasal glands but the largest is the Steno's gland (glandula nasalis lateralis), which lies in the rostral maxillary sinus and its duct empties at the vestibule. This gland is homologous with the salt gland of marine birds. It produces a watery, nonviscous secretion at the nasal airway entrance where it may help to humidify inspired air and regulate mucus viscosity. Because of the large number of autonomic nerves that are found in close contact with its acinar cells, it is believed that this gland is regulated by the nervous system in such a way that rapid adjustment of the secretory activity to changes in the humidity of the inspired air or to airborne irritants is possible. Tracheal diameter is approximately 1.6 to 1.7 mm in the adult rat, and the shape is maintained by 18 to 24 rigid C-shaped cartilage structures that form the framework of the trachea. Tracheal length from the first cartilage to bifurcation is 33 mm and because of the cartilaginous rings, extension of the head of the rat can result in lengthening of the trachea by 50% with no decrease in lumen diameter. The lung in the newborn rat is immature and contains no alveoli or alveolar ducts; instead, gas exchange occurs in smooth walled channels and saccules, and the prospective alveolar structures. Once the rat reaches 4 days old, a rapid restructuring of lung parenchyma occurs so that by day 7, the lung is morphologically more mature. Respiratory bronchioles are also absent at birth but by day 10 are easily identified. Rats have the thinnest pulmonary artery and the thickest pulmonary vein of all rodent species. In the conscious resting rat, blood flow preferentially distributes to the central and hilar regions of the lung lobes, with less blood flow to the peripheral regions. Precapillary anastomoses between the bronchial and pulmonary arteries have been demonstrated in the rat, as they have been in man and guinea pig, and are limited to the hilar region in the rat. Innervation of the lung is complex, with high neuronal density similar to the calf, mouse, and guinea pig. The rat and rabbit do not have an adrenergic nerve supply to the bronchial musculature, and bronchoconstriction is controlled by vagal tone. At least 10 Respiratory System Disease in Mouse, Rat, Hamster, and Gerbil morphologically distinct cell types have been identified in the intrapulmonary airways. Rats possess serous cells in respiratory epithelium, which are unique to this species. These cells secrete a product that has less viscosity than the mucous cell, and is thought to be responsible for the low-viscosity pericilliary liquid layer found at all levels of the rat's respiratory tract. Total lung capacity of the rat is 11.3 AE 1.4 mL and vital capacity 8.4 AE 1.7 mL. Although surfactant is composed of mostly monounsaturated phospholipids in many mammals, rat surfactant has a high content of polyunsaturated phospholipids. Carotid bodies located in the bifurcation of the common carotid artery function as chemoreceptors and respond when the tissue partial pressure of oxygen decreases to below 100 mm of mercury. Similar chemoreceptors located in the aorta are called aortic bodies, whose afferents travel via the vagi to the brain. Regulation of respiration occurs through tissue CO 2 exchange in the medullary respiratory center, with the carotid bodies playing a role. Rats have high serotonin activity and low histamine activity in the lungs.",

These glands include 1 infraseptal, 2 nasoturbinate, 5 maxilloturbinate, 1 ventromedial nasal, 4 or 5 dorsal medial nasal, and the lateral nasal gland (Steno's gland). There are 4 endoturbinates and 3 ectoturbinates, unlike the rat which has 4 endoturbinates and 2 ectoturbinates. These very intricately folded turbinates project into the lumen of the nasal cavity and thus provide for an increased nasal mucosal surface. The trachea bifurcates at the height of the fourth rib pair into thicker right and thinner left main bronchi. Reisseisen's membrane, a layer of smooth muscle and elastic tissue, lines the lobar bronchi. The diaphragm originates dorsally on the first lumbar vertebrae and is composed of a well-developed pars muscularis and a transparent centrum tendineum. The pleura forms a large right and left sac surrounding the lungs. There are no respiratory bronchioles as in the rat and guinea pig, although the guinea pig and hamster have a transition to alveolar airways within a single generation that could be classified as producing one order of respiratory bronchioles. The conductive airways contain a limited number of glandular structures, primarily in the proximal trachea. The histologic appearance of the hamster trachea closely resembles the human bronchus. The pulmonary vascular bed is similar to that of humans in many ways, and hamsters develop pulmonary lesions that resemble human centrilobular emphysema. This similarity makes the Syrian hamster a potential model for studies of chronic bronchitis. Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue, normally present only at the hilus of the lung in rodents, is absent in hamsters. Spontaneous bronchiogenic and pulmonary cancers are rare; hence, the Syrian hamster is a good model in which to study chemical carcinogenesis in the respiratory tract.",

Although infected rats are often asymptomatic, signs generally associated with respiratory disease can occur. Rats appear to have a more significant clinical presentation than mice. Lesions similar to those seen in confirmed cases of mycoplasmosis have been produced in Mycoplasma-free rats inoculated intranasally with CARB. Its pathogenic potential as a potentiator of M pulmonis respiratory disease has been demonstrated most clearly in the rat. Intranasal inoculation of young Wistar rats resulted in colonization of the upper respiratory tract and airways by 14 days. Necropsy signs are variable, and depend on the pathogenicity of the bacterial strain involved and the chronicity of the infection. CARB can be present anywhere there is ciliated respiratory epithelium, including the Eustachian tubes and middle ears.

            "text": "The organism has an affinity for the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, middle ear, and endometrium. Invasion of the middle ear occurs via the Eustachian tube and usually results in a chronic infection because the Eustachian tube opens into the tympanic bulla on the dorsal aspect, affording poor drainage to the nasopharnyx. Rats have cartilaginous rings only around primary bronchi. Damage to respiratory epithelium with ciliostasis and resultant accumulation of lysozyme-rich inflammatory exudate in the airways frequently results in weakening of bronchiolar walls and ensuing bronchiolectasis. Mycoplasma-associated host cell damage may occur by a variety of means, including uptake of essential cell metabolites and release of cytotoxic substances. Both the intact organisms and the cell membranes are Respiratory System Disease in Mouse, Rat, Hamster, and Gerbil nonspecifically mitogenic for lymphocytes. Thus, the marked lymphocytic infiltration seen in response to mycoplasmal infections does not appear to be due only to a response to a specific antigenic stimulus. The extensive lesions seen in some rat strains after exposure to M pulmonis may be attributable to an exaggerated and misdirected cellular immune response. The organism usually persists in infected rats, even in the presence of relatively high antibody titers. Microscopic changes in the affected tympanic bullae, turbinates, and major airways are characterized by a leukocytic infiltrate in the submucosa consisting of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Peribronchial, peribronchiolar, and perivascular infiltration with lymphocytes and plasma cells is a prominent feature in all stages of the disease. Chronic bronchitis and bronchiolitis frequently progress to bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis, which are characterized by dilation of airways and peribronchiolar cuffing with lymphocytes, with varying degrees of hyperplasia and metaplasia of respiratory epithelium.",

P pneumotropica is shed from upper respiratory secretions and feces, and is transmitted through direct contact. The organism has been found to be associated with conjunctivitis, rhinitis, otitis, and cervical lymphadenitis in rats and mice.

The genus Pneumocystis has undergone sequence analysis of its genes, including the 18S rRNA gene, bringing about identification of distinct species that were once all classified as Pneumocystis carinii. These species include P murina in mice, P carinii and Pneumocystis wakefieldiae in rats, and Pneumocystis jirovecii in humans. Pneumocystis is an important respiratory pathogen in ID mice, rats, and guinea pigs but does not cause overt disease in IC animals. The organism is widespread, naturally acquired by airborne transmission of the respiratory tract, and establishes a persistent, quiescent infection in the lungs. Infection may also be transmitted through the atypical colonized and shedding IC animals. This shedding may occur after infection of an IC animal, but before the infection is eliminated by the immune system. Subclinical infections that resolve in 5 to 6 weeks are relatively common in IC mice and rats, whereas ID animals are unable to clear the organism from their respiratory tract and develop a chronic infection. Treatment with trimethoprim (40 mg/mL)/sulfamethoxazole (200 mg/mL) suspension at a rate of 15.6 mL per 500 mL water will control disease symptoms but will not extinguish the infection. Daily treatment or pulse therapy following a 3 days on/4 days off pattern are recommended protocols. The water bottle must be shaken at least daily to resuspend the agent.

Mice are typically infected as 3-to 4-week-old juveniles and because of the ubiquitous nature of the organism, virtually all mice in the 4-to 12-week-old age groups should be considered to be infected and shedding. Immunity to the organism develops rapidly, with young animals being protected initially by colostral antibodies. Infection in susceptible mice proceeds slowly, leading to clinical signs of suppurative bronchopneumonia within several months. Primary signs include dyspnea and a hunched posture, which may be accompanied by wasting and scaly skin. Severe cases, such as those that occur with advanced disease, may be fatal. At necropsy, lesions are especially severe in SCID or athymic nude mice. Nonfilamentous trophic forms attach to type I pneumocytes with clusters of developmental stages spreading into the alveolar lumen. The lungs collapse poorly and have a rubbery consistency, with pale, patchy areas of consolidation. The type of pneumonia can be variable depending on the host's type of immune deficiency. Some ID mice may have very few visible cysts or alveolar exudation, with principally interstitial pneumonia. Histologic changes are characterized by interstitial alveolitis, with thickening of alveolar septa from proteinaceous exudate and infiltration with mononuclear cells. Immunocompromised mice subclinically infected with P murina that are inoculated with PVM develop severe respiratory tract lesions attributed to the dual infection. Superimposed viral infection and/or bacterial infections such as P pneumotropica can exacerbate pneumocystosis. Respiratory distress in ID mice should elicit suspicion of pneumocystosis. Pathologic examination of the lung with special staining is essential to confirm the presumptive diagnosis. Past infections may be detected through ELISA, and PCR is used to detect active infection.",

There is diffuse to focal consolidation; lungs collapse poorly, and routinely have an opaque pale pink color. In athymic rats, pulmonary lesions vary from mild to severe interstitial pneumonia. Pulmonary lesions associated with this infection have been created in young laboratory rats from naturally infected colonies that were treated with immunosuppressants, such as cortisone, and fed a diet deficient in protein for several weeks. Diagnosis of infection in IC rats usually requires at least 6 weeks of treatment with corticosterioids or cyclophosphamide to elicit a histologically detectable level of infection. Special stains demonstrate the fungal cysts within the alveoli. PCR has been used to detect infection in rat lungs consistently after only 1 week of treatment.

Mice that lack NADPH oxidase function through null mutation of gp91 (phox) developed pulmonary infections with Paecilomyces variotii. Chronic granulomatous disease in mice, especially in the lungs, was associated with Paecilomyces sp, Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhizopus sp, and Candida guilliermondii. 114 One report described almost one-fifth of Wistar rats in a 2-year carcinogenesis study as having chronic rhinitis associated with A fumigatus. The predisposing factor in these animals was thought to be subclinical SeV infection. Clinical signs included sniffling and nasal exudation. Yellowish, friable material was present either unilaterally or bilaterally in the nasal cavities, and in severe cases the nasal cavities were completely occluded. Lesions were, in most cases, limited to the nasoturbinates and maxilloturbinates. A bronchial abscess containing hyphae and multiple fruiting heads occurred in one rat. 115 Tracheobronchial aspergillosis was reported in an aged F-344 rat with concurrent large granular cell leukemia. Immunodeficiency due to the leukemia was thought to be associated with the multifocal, transmural necrotic lesions of the trachea and bronchi. 116 Two cases of Aspergillus spp rhinitis in rats that had no known immunosuppression were reported. Corncob and hardwood bedding from 2 sources were analyzed to determine if the source of the fungus was the substrate material. Six genera of fungi were isolated from corncob samples, whereas only negligible counts were isolated from hardwood samples. The investigators recommended that the use of either autoclaved or g-irradiated corncob bedding should be considered as a method to eliminate fungal contamination of bedding. 117 Respiratory System Disease in Mouse, Rat, Hamster, and Gerbil",

Some animals had a distinctive pug-faced deformity, believed to be associated with the inoculation of sarcoma material as neonates. The parasitic ova were seen in the feces of 37 of 185 stock hamsters in the facility. The ova were infective for rats when given orally.

Dissemination occurs from the nasal mucosa to the pulmonary vascular endothelium and then to draining lymph nodes. Secondary viremia further spreads the virus to multiple organs. Immune-mediated clearance of the virus begins after 5 to 7 days, with no persistence or carrier state detectable beyond 3 to 4 weeks.

SeV infects nasal, tracheal, bronchial, bronchiolar, and middle ear epithelium, and spreads to type II alveolar cells.

Acute keratoconjunctivitis can resolve or progress to keratitis with opacities, ulceration, scarring, and even perforation, in which case there can be secondary bacterial anterior uveitis or panophthalmitis.

Strains such as B6, 129 (particularly 129S4/SvJae), and Swiss mice tend to have an increased incidence and earlier onset of this lesion. AMP can cause mortality in various types of GEMs on the B6 or 129 background, and is particularly severe in B6 (ptpn6 me ) moth-eaten mice. AMP tends to be most evident in older animals and can occur in wild mice as well. Any disease that impairs normal clearance (pulmonary tumors, pneumocystosis, or other chronic pneumonias) can predispose to AMP and will lead to dyspnea if very extensive. Grossly there is lobar to diffuse tan to red discoloration of the lungs, which do not collapse. Microscopically, macrophages have abundant cytoplasm filled with large numbers of needle-shaped to rhomboid-shaped eosinophilic crystals, present in alveolar spaces, alveolar ducts, terminal airways, and bronchiolar glands. The crystalline material is a conglomerate of substances primarily composed of Ym1 chitinase, but also contains iron, a-1 antitrypsin, immunoglobulin, and granulocyte breakdown products. Based on ultrastructural studies, the crystals resemble Charcot-Leyden crystals, which are unique to nonhuman primates and humans in association with eosinophil-related diseases.",

Microscopically, clusters of alveoli, often in a subpleural location or adjacent to a terminal bronchiole, contain increased numbers of large, pale, foamy-appearing macrophages. Occasionally cholesterol clefts may be visible in denser accumulations of macrophages, and a slight infiltration of lymphocytes may be present around adjacent vessels, probably as a response to proinflammatory mediators released by the macrophages.
