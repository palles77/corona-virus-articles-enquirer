            "text": "Genomic analysis has demonstrated that canine parvovirus has continued to evolve. Parrish et aF 9 reported that all isolates examined from 1978 to 1980 were of a single type. Post-1980 isolates, however, could be distinguished by their reactivity to specific monoclonal antibodies and restriction-endonuclease cleavage patterns. Moreover, these latter strains apparently had some selective advantage over the parental strain such that they had virtually replaced it by the mid 1980s. Parrish et al proposed naming the new strain CPV-2a to indicate that it is a subtype of CPV-2. 28 Serum from dogs exposed to either CPV-2 or CPV-2a cross-reacts with both viruses and vaccines to cross-protect. Subsequent studies in the mid-1980s revealed the emergence of a third subtype, CPV-2b, which has now become the predominant type isolated in the United States. 28 The small size of the parvovirus genome and the availability of exquisitely sensitive molecular probes have made it possible to track this evolution in remarkable detail. The entire threedimensional surface of the virus has been mapped and the location of individual amino acids identified. 27 EPIDEMIOLOGY Initially, outbreaks of canine parvovirus were characterized by high morbidity and high mortality, with the majority of dogs in a group becoming clinically ill. Such outbreaks no longer occur, and the disease is encountered almost exclusively in puppies between the ages of about 6 weeks to 6 months. Virtually all adult dogs are immune, either as a result of vaccination or natural infection. Immunity to canine parvovirus following infection or modified live vaccines is long-lived-more than 2 years, and perhaps life-long. 5 Therefore, the only pool of susceptible animals are puppies born into the population. These are protected against infection for the first few weeks of life by maternal antibody so that disease is no longer encountered in neonates. 22 \u2022 33 As their maternal antibody titers decline, however, they become susceptible to infection, and if they are not adequately immunized, they become infected in the first year of life. Canine parvovirus persists for long periods in the environment (5-7 months) and is ubiquitous. Endemic parvovirus cycles exist among wild canids and in large breeding colonies. 22 \u2022 40 \u2022 44 Instances of fatal disease are still encountered, but subclinical infections are common, especially in adults, as evidenced by seroconversion without evidence of clinical disease. 18 Clinical cases in practice are generally milder with better survival rates than a decade ago, possibly due in part to a lower challenge dose. Initially, when large numbers of dogs were susceptible, the amount of virus in the environment was amplified as more and more dogs became infected so that the challenge dose increased over time until all susceptible dogs had become infected. Nowadays, except in very large colonies, there is little opportunity for stich amplification to occur because of a high level of population immunity.",

This, taken together with the enormous amounts of virus shed by infected animals (up to 10 billion TCID 5 ofg of feces) and the hardiness of the virus in the environment, are sufficient to account for the rapid world wide spread of infection in the late 1970s. 31 After ingestion, viral replication occurs in the oropharynx during the first 2 days of infection, spreading to other organs by way of the blood stream (Fig. 1) . By the third to fifth days, viremia is marked. Although usually manifest as enteric disease, parvoviral infection is systemic. The virus reaches the intestinal mucosa from the blood stream rather than from the intestinal lumen. 20 \u2022 21 For this reason, serum antibody titers are strongly correlated with protection, and passively derived antibody is completely protective in sufficient amounts. 20 Intestinal IgA is not essential for protection. Clinical signs of CPV enteritis are not manifest until 4 to 5 days after oral exposure. 31 The incubation period is believed to range from 3 to 7 or 8 days, with virus first shed on day 3, often before clinical signs appear. The lesions resulting from canine parvovirus are determined primarily by the autonomous parvoviruses' requirement for actively dividing cells. Hence, viral replication occurs principally in tissues with high rates of cell turnover-the intestine, lymphoid tissues, and bone marrow. Cells must also possess appropriate viral receptors, as not all tissues with proliferating cell populations are affected. 26 Conditions that increase cell turnover favor viral replication and increase the severity of the resulting lesions and clinical disease. Hence, if exposure to canine coronavirus, which stimulates proliferation of the germinal epithelium of the intestinal crypts by destroying more mature villous epitheliocytes, precedes canine parvovirus infection, the resulting dual infection is more severe than that produced by either virus individually. 1 In the intestinal tract, parvoviral replication kills cells of the germinal epithelium of the intestinal crypts, leading to epithelial loss, villus shortening, vomiting, and diarrhea. Lymphoid necrosis and destruction of myeloproliferative cells results in lymphopenia and, in severe, cases, panleukopenia.",

Entire litters would be affected, most dying within a few days, whereas survivors often went on to develop chronic heart failure within a few months of birth.

They should probably be reserved only for severe or prolonged cases, however, because slowing the flow through the intestine may increase toxin absorption.

Two hypothetical litters are illustrated. Puppies with low maternal antibody levels are susceptibie to infection and vaccination at an earlier age than puppies with high maternal antibody levels. Only a single successful inoculation with a modified live vaccine is needed to adequately immunize a puppy. the higher the virus titer in the vaccine and the lower the degree of attenuation, the greater the vaccine's ability to immunize in the presence of antibody. This implies a certain trade-off between safety and immunizing ability; a general rule for vaccines. .Extravagant claims about the ability to \"override\" maternal antibody have been made for a number of commercial vaccines.-----------~------~----~----------------",
