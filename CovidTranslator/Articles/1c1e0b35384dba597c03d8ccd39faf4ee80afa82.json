However, since many viruses are unequipped to establish lifelong persistence, they may evolve to maximize their yields within limited time windows (i.e., maximize \u03b2). In this connection, while describing possible virus strategies, Alizon at al [3] allude to the Achilles' dilemma, a choice between a short and bright life (i.e. brief acute infection with high virus loads) versus a long but inglorious one (persistent infection with low virus loads excreted during longer periods). Severe symptoms or even the death of hosts may be evolutionarily beneficial for a virus if they increase the resulting number of infectious particles excreted and transmitted.",

It is very important that the \"tempo\" of pathogen expansion into a host population depends on the average number of susceptible hosts that come in contact with an infected host (denoted S in the equation above). A virus strategy that involves fast and severe pathogenesis should be more efficient in very dense populations where the hosts are contacting each other more frequently. Highly pathogenic viruses should also benefit from the high rate of host's reproduction, as this masks the declines in host's numbers caused by infection-related death. However, such viruses indirectly limit their own progression by decimating the host population (i.e. by decreasing S), making lethal diseases a poor long-term strategy. In contrast to this common-sense notion, some pathogens, such as smallpox virus or foot-and-mouth disease virus, in real life cause harsh symptoms in their native hosts.

Also, the changed behavior of active search and biting increases the number of contacts with susceptible hosts.

            "text": "Some viral diseases are known to exist as several discrete forms (Fig 1F) rather than with a continuous gradient of symptoms' harshness. The best understood examples are lysogenic bacteriophages, which are \"benign\" while host bacteria are growing on rich medium and \"acute\" when hosts are starving. Interestingly, a recent report showed intercommunication between bacteriophages allow them to choose the most effective infection strategy, lytic or lysogenic [12] . Dual pathogenesis is also known for animal pathogens, for example Drosophila C virus displays two drastically different pathogenic patterns, lethal and persistent, in genetically identical hosts depending on the route of infection (intrahaemocoelic versus oral) and input virus load. Persistently infected flies display minor pathogenesis, little if any lifespan shortening and sometimes increased fecundity [13] . Acutely infected animals succumb rapidly, producing enormous amounts of virus (more than in 3 orders of magnitude exceeding those in benign infections) [14] . Out of human pathogens the extensively studied example of the \"dual behavior\" is poliomyelitis, a disease caused by a benign gut virus that sporadically penetrates into central nervous system and induces acute encephalitis, which leads to flaccid paralysis and sometimes death, in less than 1% of infected human hosts [15] . Curiously, dual behavior of poliovirus seems to be evolutionary conserved. Experiments suggest that neurotropism of poliovirus can be compromised by mutations [16] or even by reducing diversity in virus' quasispecies populations [17] . Currently used live poliovirus vaccines are replication-competent and can be transmitted from human to human, but are not capable to induce flaccid paralysis. However, these attenuated viruses rapidly revert to strains again capable to induce severe disease [18] . These observations, taken together with polio-like flaccid paralysis symptoms documented already by Ancient Egyptians, argue the polio-derived pathology is an evolutionary stable adaptation rather than a coincidence. However the exact evolutional benefit of acute poliovirus infection is unclear. One is tempted to speculate that It might relate to specific behavioral reactions of prehistoric humans to paralysis in their infants. Many researchers consider poliovirus neurovirulence an \"accidental\" event [19] . They argue that neuroinvasion is not needed for successful polio replication and occurs largely independent on host's parameters (age, gender, etc) while its retention in evolution is a coincidence as it is believed to happen for neutral adaptations [20] , e.g. by occasional genetic linkage with the function that is vital for reproduction. Existence of a minority of patients with severe symptoms (polio, influenza A H1N1 and B, etc) is clearly a major concern for public health that requires to be studied and explained. Even more importantly, acute viruses (such as Ebola [21] , West Nile [22] , tick-born encephalitis [23] , Crimean-Congo hemmoragic fever [24] , MERS-CoV [25] and many others) can infect humans without any symtoms as judged by seroconversion analysis. Humans asymptomatically infected with dengue [26] and Zika [27] viruses were directly shown to spread the pathogens. Thus variability in pathogenesis is an almost universal feature, but in most cases virus-driven variability is difficult to differentiate from genetic or epigenetic variations in the hosts. This problem is also poorly addressed in animal models since often invariable experimental systems are used. The focus of this article is to discuss the possible theoretical tools that might address this type of phenomena from an evolutional perspective.",

If these transformations are occurring regularly over time and space (due to seasons, oscillations of population density etc) virus might occupy a wider region of expected equilibria on the tradeoff chart, rather than to continuously evolve towards the sliding shortterm punctiform equilibrium. We propose that variation in virulence, usually considered by most researchers as an outcome of biological noise affecting pathogenesis, could in some part come from an implementation of intrinsic virus strategy. Moreover these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive: viruses can intentionally exploit variability and biological noise by making their replication machinery specifically sensitive to variable factors, as in case of bacteriophages, or even employ the stochasticity, as it is believed for poliovirus. Taking in account that virus pathogenesis on the organism level in some cases might depend on infection outcome in a small groups of susceptible cells (e.g. endothelial cells, organizing blood-brain barrier in mammals), it is possible that the pathogenesis on the host level could have a stochastic component, as it has been recently demonstrated on the single-cell level [28] . In this case virus might adapt a dual strategy composed of majorly conservative choices (low risk-low reward) and a small proportion of highly risky behavior (high risk-high reward), alternating stochastically.",

All viruses are evolving to lower their virulence (here virus-related mortality rate per time unit, \u03b1) and increase transmission (rate per susceptible host per time unit, \u03b2). This assumes independent evolution of these twoparameters. Dots show different virus strains or species. B. Hypothesis of tradeoff (interdependence) of virulence and transmission due to host-scale factors. Paths show direction of dynamics of host population towards local equilibrium. Curve with dots: different possible local equilibria (depending on initial values \u03b1 and \u03b2). Thus, virulence and transmissibility, although defined on the epidemiological scale, are mutually restricted due to underlying host-scale factors. C. A single tradeoff point.
