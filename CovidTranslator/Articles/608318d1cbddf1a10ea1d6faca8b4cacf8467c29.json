In 48% (140/292) of the total ALRI cases, a single virus was detected while coinfections were observed in 8% (22/292) of the samples. The most frequent viruses were rhinovirus/enterovirus (35%), human respiratory syncytial virus (26%), and influenza viruses (13%). Parainfluenza viruses were detected in 9%, adenovirus in 6%, human metapneumovirus in 4%, coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1) in 4%, and bocavirus in 3% of ALRI specimens. Most viral infections occurred in patients below 5 years of age. The distribution of viruses varied according to age-groups. No significant correlation was observed between the severity of the disease and the age of patients or the virus species. This study provides the description of viral etiology among patients presenting with ALRI in Lao PDR. Additional investigations are required to better understand the clinical role of the different viruses and their seasonality in Laos.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 1 They represent around 2 million deaths per year, especially in infants. 2 The burden of these infections is particularly important in developing countries. 3 During the last decade, South East Asia received much attention from the international scientific community due to the emergence of respiratory viruses with pandemic potential (SARS-CoV, avian influenza A/ H5N1 virus). 4 Respiratory infections can be caused by numerous viruses, including influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronaviruses (HCoV), adenoviruses, human bocavirus, and human enteroviruses. Molecular techniques have become more and more popular to detect these viruses. Multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been shown to be a sensitive tool and allows identification of a majority of respiratory viruses, as well as coinfections. [5] [6] [7] In Lao PDR, the etiology of respiratory infections is still poorly documented. To improve the clinical management of the patients, limit unnecessary antibiotic use, and prevent opportunistic secondary infections, it appears important to develop surveillance and tools to assess the etiology of acute respiratory infections in this country. 8, 9 The purpose of this study was to describe during a limited period of time the viral etiology of acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in patients hospitalized in two Lao hospitals by using a set of five multiplex RT-PCR/PCR targeting 18 common respiratory viruses.",

[17] [18] [19] However, in our study, we detected more rhinoviruses (HRhVs) and enteroviruses (35%) than HRSV (26%) among the 292 patients included. Even if HRhVs are typically associated with the common cold, 20 recent studies suggest that these viruses may also be associated with more severe illness, including lower respiratory disease and asthma exacerbations. 21, 22 In this study, HRhV was detected in respiratory specimens from 33% of patients with bronchitis or asthma, in 25% of patients with bronchiolitis, and in 16% of those presenting with pneumonia. Rhinoviruses/enteroviruses were often implicated in coinfections (73% of all the coinfections detected). However, the clinical significance of the detection of a HRhV by a highly sensitive RT-PCR method has been questioned as Table 1 . these viruses can also be detected in asymptomatic children. 23, 24 Rhinoviruses and enteroviruses seem to circulate all year round, without clear seasonality. Human respiratory syncytial virus was the second most common virus detected in this study with a total of 49 cases (26% of patients with a positive RT-PCR result). This virus is recognized as the leading cause of hospitalizations in children aged \u22645 years for respiratory illness in industrialized countries. [25] [26] [27] Similarly to other countries, we demonstrated a substantial burden of HRSV-associated ALRI in Lao PDR. The infants and children aged <5 years were significantly more frequently infected, and then the incidence of HRSV infections decreased with age, probably because of the development of anti-HRSV immunity which is boosted during each subsequent reinfection. [28] [29] [30] During the study period, the peak of HRSV activity occurred from June to October, which corresponds to the rainy season ( Figure 4) . Similar observations were also reported in neighboring countries. 17, 25, 31 The overall incidence of influenza viruses infection was relatively low (12%), and the majority of the cases detected (69\u00c16%) were among patients older than 5 years with a median age of 12\u00c13 years. These results are in line with those of a preliminary study on influenza-like illness in Lao PDR in which the incidence of influenza was 10\u00c14%. 32 The influenza A virus strains detected during the study period were exclusively 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses.",

The most common viruses were rhinoviruses/enteroviruses [35%; CI 95 = (28-42%)], HRSV [26%; CI 95 = (20-33%)], influenza viruses [12%; CI 95 = (8-17%)], PIVs [9%; CI 95 = (5-13%)], and adenoviruses [6%; CI 95 = (3-9%)]. Human metapneumovirus and HCoV were identified in 4% [CI 95 = (1-6%)] and bocavirus in 3% [CI 95 = (1-6%)] of the samples. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus was never detected (Figure 2). Influenza A viruses were detected in 9\u00c11% of the samples (17 cases, all 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus), influenza B in 2\u00c17% (five cases), and influenza C in only one case. PIV-1 and PIV-3 represented the majority of the PIVs detected (35\u00c13% each). Multiple viral infections were observed in 22 [7\u00c15%; CI 95 = (5-11%)] patients including 20 dual infections and two infections with three different viruses",
