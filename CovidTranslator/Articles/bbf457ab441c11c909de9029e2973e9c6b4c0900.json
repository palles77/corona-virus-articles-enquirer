            "text": "The treatment of rodents as pets is one of these emerging fields, presenting a terrain bristling with complexities for many veterinarians. First among these is the common perception of rodents. Most people do not consider them pets, and they usually are called \"vermin.\" Moreover, almost all scientists consider rodents experimental tools. Veterinarians are not immune to such prejudices, and some may feel reluctant to examine a fully grown, red-eyed, wheezing rat. Owners of pet rodents often feel the same aversion for unsympathetic veterinarians and as a result travel long distances to see one who understands their needs. A second area of concern is the unfamiliarity of clinical veterinarians with rodent biology. Although much information has been accumulated on wild and laboratory rodents, very little of this information pertains to pet rodents. Geriatric diseases, the pharmacokinetics of common drugs, and the beneficial and harmful effects of human handling, contact, and care are a few of the phantom areas in this field. Yet the spectrum of problems affecting rodents does not differ greatly from that of dogs and cats.",

Derangements likely to be seen in practice include trauma-induced injuries, infectious diseases, and problems related to nutrition and aging; genetic disorders are uncommon. Natural infections that would be considered rare in a laboratory animal colony often are transmitted to rodent pets by other pets and by children; for example, pet animals other than rodents are a major reservoir of dermatophytes, 24 and human beings are the main natural host of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. 41 Rodents used for research are maintained in tightly controlled environments designed to reduce the impact of unwanted variables in animal experiments. 18 However, pet rodents generally are exposed to temperature, humidity, and light-cycle changes; a broad range of foods; numerous microorganisms borne by animals and human beings; and various types of handling.

Disease prevention is primarily based on common-sense husbandry practices, such as purchasing healthy, genetically sound animals; supplying balanced fresh food appropriate in protein and caloric content; providing clean, fresh water; furnishing adequate shelter that includes shade from direct sunlight; avoiding drafts and excessive temperature or humidity changes; keeping cages clean by preventing the accumulation of excess feces and urine; isolating sick animals from a group for treatment; and protecting vulnerable animals from more aggressive members of their group (e.g., young animals from older animals and male hamsters from female hamsters) or from natural predators living in the same household (e.g., mice from cats). Other sound husbandry practices include housing different species separately to prevent interspecies disease transmission (e.g., rats carry Streptobacillus moniliformis in their nasopharyngeal cavity, which causes septicemia in mice) and reducing obesity by limiting food intake and providing cage accessories that allow play and exploration (e.g., exercise wheels, tunnels, and ramps).",

A survey from a large research animal diagnostic laboratory indicated skin disease in mice represents 25% of all cases (for all species) submitted for diagnosis. 37 I categorize four groups of skin problems in mice: behavioral disorders, husbandry-related problems, microbiologic and parasitic infections, and idiopathic conditions. Behavioral, husbandry-related, and infectious causes of skin disease are relatively straightforward to diagnose and treat. However, many skin diseases characterized by chronic or ulcerated skin (often secondarily colonized by bacteria) are diagnosed as idiopathic. This group is commonly unresponsive to either topical or systemic treatment, and affected individuals are often euthanatized. Mice exhibit well-studied social and sexual behavior. Social dominance, a form of behavior relating to the social rank and dominance status of an individual mouse in a group, is manifested as barbering and fighting. Barbering is a unique condition seen in group-housed mice in which the dominant mouse nibbles off the whiskers and hair around the muzzle and eyes of cagemates ( Fig. 29-1 ). There are no other lesions, and only one mouse (the dominant one) retains all its fur. Removing the dominant mouse stops barbering; frequently, however, another mouse assumes the dominant role. Barbering is often seen in female mice caged together. Male mice, except littermates raised together from birth, are more likely to fight, often very savagely, and inflict severe bite wounds on one another, especially over the rump, tail, and shoulders.",

In this situation, replacing the cage equipment does not help. Instead, provide environmental enrichment toys such as running wheels or hollow tubes. Nursing mice often have ventral abdominal and thoracic alopecia; this is normal and is nearly always associated with the extensive distribution of mammary glands. Absorbent cotton or cotton-wool may wrap around the legs of suckling mice and cause necrosis and sloughing of limb extremities. 58 Most infectious causes of alopecia and dermatitis are associated with fur mites. Generalized thinning of the hair, especially on difficult-to-groom areas such as the head and trunk, is seen ( Fig. 29-2 ). The coat often appears greasy and, in cases of heavy infestation, mice are noticeably pruritic with self-inflicted dermal ulcers. Three mite species are commonly seen: Myobia musculi, Myocoptes musculinus, and Radfordia affinis. The most clinically significant species is M. musculi, but infestations are usually caused by more than one species. Mites are spread by direct contact with infected mice or infested bedding. Diagnosis is based on identifying adult mites, nymphs, or eggs on hair shafts with a hand lens or a stereoscopic microscope. Adults and nymphs appear pearly white and elongate (being about twice as long as they are wide); eggs are oval and seen attached to the base of hairs or inside mature females. Treat mice with mite infestations with ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg SC or PO) twice at 10-day intervals. Alternatively, place a few drops of ivermectin solution (diluted to 1:100 in equal parts of water and propylene glycol for three treatments) on the mouse's head to allow spread by grooming and ingestion. 6 Fragrant wood chips such as cedar and pine are high in volatile hydrocarbons and have long been known to have ectoparasiticidal properties. However, the hydrocarbons also induce cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver, which increase the metabolism of many common anesthetics and drugs (e.g., the sleep time of pentobarbital is decreased). Fragrant wood chips may also be associated with skin hypersensitivity, so I recommend replacing this type of bedding with paper or recycled paper litter.",

            "text": "CRD is the best understood multifactorial respiratory infection in rats. M. pulmonis is the major component of CRD, also known as murine respiratory mycoplasmosis. Rats may live 2 to 3 years with CRD. Clinical signs are highly variable, and initial infection develops without any clinical signs. Early signs involve both the upper and the lower respiratory tracts and may include snuffling, nasal discharge, polypnea, weight loss, hunched posture, ruffled coat, head tilt, and red tears. 15, 35 Thoracic radiographs may be helpful in the diagnosis of CRD (Fig 29-5) . The most important aspect of CRD for clinicians is that respiratory mycoplasmosis varies greatly in disease expression because of environmental, host, and organismal factors that influence the host-pathogen relationship. Examples of such factors include intracage ammonia levels; concurrent Sendai virus, coronavirus (sialodacryoadenitis virus), pneumonia virus of mice, rat respiratory virus, or CAR bacillus infection; the genetic susceptibility of the host; the virulence of the Mycoplasma strain; and vitamin A or E deficiency. 15 For many years, the standard treatment for laboratory rats was to add tetracycline to sweetened water. However, this treatment is ineffective in rats because blood antibiotic concentrations are below minimum inhibitory concentrations, and pulmonary tissue concentration of tetracycline is noninhibitory. Instead, administer enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg PO q12h for 7 days) in combination with doxycycline hyclate (5 mg/kg PO q12h for 7 days). Although mycoplasma and CAR bacillus are susceptible to this antibiotic therapy, the respiratory viruses are not. In addition, certain strains of rats have a heightened cellular immune response to mycoplasma that aggravates respiratory damage. Therefore, warn owners that antibiotic treatment will not cure CRD but may alleviate clinical signs. Reducing ammonia levels in cages by removing bedding and using clean paper daily may also help. Despite developing high antibody titers to mycoplasma and high antibiotic tissue levels, affected animals typically have persistent M. pulmonis infection. Chronic signs of infection often include middle ear infection (by way of the eustachian tube); ciliostasis and subsequent buildup of lysozyme-rich inflammatory exudate in airways; and, eventually, bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis from inflammatory damage to the bronchiolar membranes. Abscesses may develop in scattered areas of one or both lungs. In these animals with advanced CRD, reducing ammonia levels in cages and administering bronchodilators and low levels of short-acting corticosteroids are also sometimes helpful in reducing clinical signs.",

Infection with C. kutscheri (Fig. 29-7) also results in pneumonia but only in debilitated or immunosuppressed animals. In pet rats, immunosuppression can result from diabetes, neoplasia, or dietary deficiencies. C. kutscheri pneumonia is rare in pet rats. Pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae can be of sudden onset. Young rats are more severely affected than are older ones, and often the only sign they exhibit is sudden death. Mature rats may demonstrate dyspnea, snuffling, and abdominal breathing. A purulent exudate may be seen around the nares and on the front paws (from wiping of the nostrils). A tentative diagnosis can be based on identifying numerous gram-positive diplococci on a Gram stain of the exudate or in a sample submitted for cytologic examination (Fig. 29-8) . Severe bacteremia is an important consequence of advanced disease and results in multiorgan abscesses and infarction. Treatment must be aggressive, and the use of beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins such as cloxacillin, oxacillin, and dicloxacillin (all of which can be administered orally) is recommended. There are no published dosages of these drugs for rats, and the dosage is empirical. Urinary system Chronic progressive nephrosis (CPN) is the best-known age-related disease of rats. In CPN, the kidneys are enlarged and pale and have a pitted, mottled surface that often contains pinpoint cysts (Fig. 29-9) . Lesions consist of a progressive glomerulosclerosis and myriad tubulointerstitial disease primarily involving the convoluted proximal tubule (Fig. 29-10) . 27 The most striking change in renal function is a proteinuria level exceeding 10 mg/day that progressively increases in severity with age. The features of CPN are qualitatively similar among different strains of laboratory rats, but the onset, incidence, and severity of the disease vary considerably. The disease occurs earlier and is of greater severity in males than in females; urinary protein excretion averaging 137 mg/day has been documented in The proximal tubules are dilated and contain copious amounts of a protein-rich material; this finding indicates the deterioration of glomeruli that fail to filter and retain plasma protein.",

Diarrhea may occur in hamsters of any age and is known as wet-tail, although this euphemism is frequently used to describe the disease in young hamsters. Proliferative ileitis is the most significant intestinal disease of 3-to10-week-old hamsters and results in a high mortality rate. It is caused by the intracellular bacterium Lawsonia intracellularis, which is also responsible for proliferative enteropathy in pigs and ferrets. 43, 57 Treatment must be aggressive and involves correcting any life-threatening electrolyte imbalance, administering antibiotics, and force-feeding. Several antibiotic treatments are recommended, including tetracycline hydrochloride (400 mg/L of drinking water for 10 days), tetracycline (10 mg/kg PO q12h for 5-7 days), enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg PO or IM q12h for 5-7 days), and trimethoprim-sulfa combination (30 mg/kg PO q12h for 5-7 days). Symptomatic treatment with bismuth subsalicylate may be given if diarrhea persists. Give replacement electrolyte and glucose solutions orally, and administer electrolyte replacement fluids such as saline or lactated Ringer's solution at a dose of 20 mL/100 g q24h. Offer liquid food such as pureed baby spinach, apples, carrots, and lettuce mixed in equal parts with a slurry made from rodent pellets, or offer a nutritional supplement such as Critical Care (Oxbow Pet Products). Adding 1 tablespoon of honey to the feed mixture may make it more palatable. If the hamster does not eat, force-feed small amounts of liquid feed. Potential sequelae to proliferative ileitis in surviving hamsters are obstruction, intussusception, or rectal prolapse (see Chapter 30) . 16 Diarrhea in adult hamsters is associated with enterotoxemia caused by Clostridium difficile and may develop 3 to 5 days after treatment with antibiotics such as penicillin, lincomycin, or bacitracin. Bovine antibodies against toxigenic C. difficile administered orally will protect hamsters against experimental antibiotic-associated enterotoxemia. 47 Tyzzer's disease (Clostridium piliforme, previously known as Bacillus piliformis) was described in hamsters and gerbils obtained from a pet store supplier. 51 In this outbreak, hamsters and gerbils had a high mortality rate but the rats and mice did not. Affected rodents were depressed and dehydrated and had scruffy coats and diarrhea; many animals had no clinical signs before death. The authors concluded that the clinical outbreak was precipitated by severe stress, including that caused by overcrowding, high environmental temperature and humidity, heavy internal and external parasite load, and nutritionally inadequate diets, despite the prophylactic treatment of drinking water with oxytetracycline. Tyzzer's disease, first recognized in 1917 in a colony of Japanese waltzing mice by Tyzzer at Harvard, 72 is frequently listed in laboratory animal textbooks as an intestinal disease of rodents and other animals. However, the actual prevalence of the infection in rodents is unknown. The report concerning the pet store illustrates the opportunistic nature of C. piliforme in immunosuppressed animals. The disease is not seen in healthy immunocompetent animals.",

            "text": "Cardiovascular system Atrial thrombosis has been described in aging research hamsters, 33 and in certain strains the incidence is high (up to 73%). 12 Most thromboses develop in the left atrium from heart failure and lead to a consumptive coagulopathy (Fig. 29-12 ). Although the incidence does not differ between the sexes in aged hamsters, atrial thrombosis occurs on average at a younger age in females (13.5 months) than in males (21.5 months). 12 Aged pet hamsters have clinical signs of cardiomyopathy such as hyperpnea, tachycardia, and cyanosis. Untreated hamsters typically die within 1 week after these signs are evident. The endocrine status of the animal and especially the amount of circulating androgens influence the incidence of atrial thrombosis. Thus castration of male hamsters is linked to an increase in the prevalence of atrial thrombosis. 66 Cardiomyopathy should be suspected in aged pet hamsters (older than 1.5 years) that present clinically with signs of tachypnea, lethargy, anorexia, and cold extremities. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and results of radiography and ultrasonography of the heart. Treatment of heart disease is symptomatic and involves empirical use of digoxin, diuretics, angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors, and prophylactic anticoagulants. Recommended dosages for hamsters are available for some of these drugs; otherwise, extrapolate dosages from those used in ferrets and closely monitor the response. Verapamil, a calcium antagonist, administered at a dose increasing from 0.25 mg to 0.50 mg SC q8h over a 4-week period, prevented severe myocardial lesions in untreated 2-month-old inbred female myopathic hamsters. 39 Endocrine system Surveys of spontaneous lesions in laboratory hamsters describe a high incidence of adrenocortical hyperplasia and adenoma. 62 However, despite extensive histopathologic study, there has been only one clinical report of hyperadrenocorticism, or Cushing's disease, in three hamsters, with high serum cortisol concentrations documented in only one of the three animals. 5 Hamsters with clinical signs resembling those of Cushing's disease are occasionally seen in practice (Fig. 29-13 ). Diagnosis is based on documenting classic signs seen in dogs, such as a history of polydipsia, polyuria, and polyphagia; clinical signs of alopecia and hyperpigmentation; and high concentrations of plasma cortisol and serum alkaline phosphatase. Reference values of cortisol concentrations are low compared with those of other species and range from 0.5 to 1.0 mg/dL in normal males and females. 76 Hamsters may secrete both cortisol and corticosterone 56 ; therefore, at present, meaningful measurement of plasma cortisol concentrations in hamsters is empirical. If hyperadrenocorticism is suspected, the cause, such as hypersecretion by a functional tumor, primary adrenal hyperplasia, or excess adrenocorticotropic hormone production, often is more difficult to determine. Hamsters respond to exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation. 76 In the clinical report of the three hamsters, one hamster that was treated with metyrapone (8 mg PO q24h for 1 month) responded well; another hamster treated with o,p\u00a2-DDD (mitotane) (5 mg PO q24h for 1 month) did not improve and was then given a similar dose of metyrapone, also without success. 4 Further research needs to be done on this syndrome.",

If the hamster is treated soon after the exophthalmos occurs, then the prognosis for saving the eye is good. Cleanse the ocular area gently with an ophthalmic wash, and lubricate the eye with sterile ophthalmic lubricant. Gently retract the lid margins around the globe until the eye returns to its normal position. Treat the eye with an antibiotic ophthalmic ointment for a minimum of 7 to 10 days.

In older hamsters, lymphoma is the most frequently observed neoplasm of the hematopoietic system. 71 These tumors are often multicentric, involving the thymus, thoracic lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, superficial lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and other sites. Cytology of the tumors is variable. A second variation, cutaneous lymphoma, which resembles mycosis fungoides, an epidermotropic T-cell lymphoma in humans, is seen in adult hamsters. 29 Lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, patchy alopecia, and exfoliative erythroderma have been described in affected animals. Pathologists have noted dense infiltrates of neoplastic lymphocytes in the dermis, with extension into the epidermis. The third variation is an epizootic of lymphoma in young hamsters. The causative agent is hamster polyomavirus (HaPV). 4 When HaPV is first introduced into a naive population of breeding hamsters, an epizootic of lymphoma, with an incidence as high as 80%, can result. Once enzootic in a hamster population, the occurrence of lymphoma declines to a much lower level. Enzootically infected hamsters develop HaPV skin tumors rather than lymphoma. Hamsters with HaPV lymphoma appear thin, often with palpable abdominal masses. Tumors often arise in the mesentery but can arise in the axillary and cervical lymph nodes. The tumors are often lymphoid, but erythroblastic, reticulosarcomatous, and myeloid types occur. Anecdotal reports of chemotherapy in hamsters have been based on protocols using drugs that can be administered subcutaneously, orally, or intraperitoneally at dosages used in other small animals.",

Clinical lesions adjacent to the external nares appear erythematous initially; these lesions progress to localized alopecia and then to an extensive moist dermatitis ( Fig.  29-14) . The cause is believed to be an increase in the secretion of porphyrins by the harderian gland (as in chromodacryorrhea in rats), which act as a primary skin irritant. Various staphylococcal species (S. aureus and S. xylosus) may act synergistically to produce the dermatitis. 10, 68 Stress may cause excessive harderian gland secretion. Two examples of stress are overcrowding and exposure to an environmental humidity of greater than 50% (in this case, the coat stands out and appears matted instead of lying sleekly against the body). Gerbils require sandbathing to keep their coats from becoming oily. Keeping the gerbil in a dry environment, cleaning its face, and providing soft clay or sand bedding instead of abrasive wood chip bedding usually alleviate the problem.

Unlike rats or mice, if a gerbil is picked up by the tip of its tail, the skin often slips off, leaving a raw, exposed tail that eventually becomes necrotic and sheds (Fig. 29-15 ). If the tail skin is lost, surgically amputate the bare tail where the skin ends. The tail usually sloughs if it is left untreated. When picking up a gerbil, avoid grasping the tail unless it is gently held at the base. The best holding technique involves placing the palm of the hand over the gerbil's back and encircling the body with thumb and fingers. Gerbils bite if they are not handled securely, despite the claim in many reviews that they rarely bite human handlers regardless of provocation.",

Tumors and aging After 2 to 3 years of age, approximately 25% to 40% of gerbils develop neoplasia. 49, 73 Squamous cell carcinoma of the sebaceous ventral marking gland in males and ovarian granulosa cell tumor in females account for 80% of tumors seen in animals older than 3 years. Besides neoplasia, older gerbils have a high incidence of chronic interstitial nephritis. 8 Aged gerbils have a remarkable propensity for the development of aural cholesteatoma, a nonneoplastic keratinizing epithelial mass that occurs in the middle ear and mastoid region, erodes bone, and invades the labyrinth and the cranial cavity. 14 Degus Degus, or trumpet-tail rats, are native to Chile. Taxonomically, they are in the same diverse order as guinea pigs and chinchillas. Degus have been used as laboratory animals for 20 years, but there are very few reports on naturally occurring diseases. One report describes a 3-month-old pet degu with a tibial fracture that was repaired by medullary fixation. 7 Like chinchillas, captive degus must be provided with a dust bath twice a week. 1 Although degus do not drink much water, owners should change water bottles regularly to prevent bacterial overgrowth. The testicles of male degus are intraabdominal and the method of castration is by laparotomy. 20 Integumentary system Clinicians should not hold degus by the tail because they will spin like a top, leaving the veterinarian holding only the skin. Degus familiar with their owners do not show this behavior and tail shedding is uncommon. 1 Endocrine and ocular system Degus develop spontaneous diabetes mellitus caused by amyloidosis of Langerhans islets. Cellular infiltration of Langerhans islets induced by cytomegalovirus, alpha cell crystals with the presence of a herpes-type virus, and foods such as guinea pig chow or fresh fruit that increase blood glucose concentrations are also associated with the development of diabetes in degus. 22, 53, 69 Owners should feed degus a commercial rodent diet supplemented with vegetables. Like prairie dogs, it is easy to overfeed degus and obesity is likely to occur. No treatments have been described for diabetic degus.",
