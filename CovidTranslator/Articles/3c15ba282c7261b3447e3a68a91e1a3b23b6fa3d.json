None of them were symptomatic. Most passengers had taken no precautionary measures against possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2, while all the flight attendants well wore masks. During the flight, a man passenger (patient 1) who traveled from Wuhan had a fever and no respiratory symptoms. Also, he did not wear a mask. After the 5-hour flight, the plane arrived in Hangzhou at 10 pm. Considering there were some Wuhan citizens on aircraft, staffs from the Hangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had been on standby at the airport and once the aircraft arrived they boarded to screen for possible fever and respiratory symptoms amongst the passengers and crew members. They had found that patient 1 still had a fever and his temperature was 38.1 . Then, his throat swab specimens were collected and sent to CDC. Five hours later, he was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was admitted into the designated hospital.

For the ten patients included in our study, there was no recognized exposure history in 14 days before this fight. The incubation period was defined as the time from the flight arrival day to the onset of illness. Hospitalized days were defined as the period from admission to discharge day. The study has been reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committees of Xiaoshan First people's Hospital (Approval NO: 2020-02).

We suspect the real risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within aircraft cabins in our investigation could be much higher than 3.69% because there might be asymptomatic COVID-19 patients among the other 313 passengers and crew members. Moreover, a period of 5 hours together in aircraft cabin with index patient is long enough to facilitate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Also, we believe that the risk of in-flight transmission can vary widely, influenced by whether people wore masks, physical proximity to the index patient(s), the stage of illness and numbers of index patient(s), the type of air-ventilation system, size of aircraft cabin, duration of the flight [23, 24].

However, compared with SARS, the risk of in-flight transmission for influenza appears to be far higher, with 72% of all passengers developed a clinical syndrome of influenza during the next 3 days after a 3-hour flight. Further researches are in urgent need to investigate the real magnitude and determined factors of the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission aboard aircraft. We believe that a most likely time for transmission of COVID-19 in the ten passengers was during or immediately before the flight. The clustering of illness onset around 3 days in these patients is consistent with the expected incubation period of COVID-19. There was no recognized exposure history within 14 days before this fight, although it is still possible that the passengers were infected before the flight because the incubation period could be longer up to 24 days [4]. Transmission on an aircraft of SARS-CoV-2 might occur when COVID-19 patients fly, especially during the symptomatic phase of illness. Therefore, we believe that the most plausible index case resulting transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the other nine passengers was patient 1, the 45-year-old man from Wuhan, who had onset of fever during this flight.

Features of transmission between SARS and COVID-19 were largely different. For example, health workers account for majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV, while infection with SARS-CoV-2 usually develops in social clusters or family clusters [3]. Wider-Smith reported the first case in-flight transmission of SARS from Singapore [28]. They suggested that it is unlikely to have mass infection of SARS on airplanes. However, we believe it is very likely that mass infection of COVID-19 can occur during a flight, especially when respiratory and contact precautions were not in place.How the SARS-CoV-2 in our study transmitted among the ten passengers was largely unknown. Transmission via aerosol is a possible way for SARS-CoV-2, especially when persons are placed for a long-time under high concentration of aerosol circumstances. We suspect small-particle, airborne, contact, or even large-droplet spread is the possible route of COVID-19 transmission on aircraft. To explore the potential modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we might refer to anecdotal reports about other respiratory pathogens. Previous studies had documented All rights reserved.

Instead, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and influenza virus were primarily transmitted through airborne routes [29]. Further systematic studies based on more cases infected SARS-CoV-2 within aircraft cabins are imperative to determine the exact mode of in-flight transmission. As a lesson from SARS, three measures might decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission on aircrafts, including substantial decrease of flights from and to the areas that are seriously affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, the implantation of strict and effective preflight screening to find out the possible symptomatic persons, and especially correct and wide use of masks by passengers and crew members during a flight [15].Moreover, we highly appreciate and suggest the implantation of two weeks' routine quarantine for COVID-19 after the flight when any passenger or crew member had an onset of fever or respiratory symptoms during the flight to avoid the disease being spread at the destination.",
