SAXS provides overall parameters and low resolution shapes of solubilized MPs, but is also meaningfully employed in hybrid modeling procedures that combine scattering data with information provided by high-resolution techniques (eg. macromolecular crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy). Structural modeling of MPs from SAXS data is non-trivial, and the necessary computational procedures require further formalization and facilitation. We propose an automated pipeline integrated with the laboratory-information management system ISPyB, aimed at preliminary SAXS analysis and the first-step reconstruction of MPs in detergent solutions, in order to streamline high-throughput studies, especially at synchrotron beamlines. The pipeline queries an ISPyB database for available a priori information via dedicated services, estimates model-free SAXS parameters and generates preliminary models utilizing either ab initio, high-resolution-based, or mixed/hybrid methods. The results of the automated analysis can be inspected online using the standard ISPyB interface and the estimated modeling parameters may be utilized for further in-depth modeling beyond the pipeline. Examples of the pipeline results for the modelling of the tetrameric alpha-helical membrane channel Aquaporin0 and mechanosensitive channel T2, solubilized by n-Dodecyl \u03b2-D-maltoside are presented. We demonstrate how the increasing amount a priori information improves the model resolution and enables deeper insights into the molecular structure of protein-detergent complexes.",

Fortunately, the development of milder detergents and detergent stabilized bilayer systems (bicelles) has helped to overcome this problem (7, 8, 13, 14) . Importantly, the solution behaviour of many commercially available detergents has been well characterised using a range of techniques, including small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) (15) .

Integrated HPLC facilitates simultaneous sample purification and X-ray data acquisition, separating the scattering signal from protein, detergent and protein-detergent complexes (PDCs) that appear in the elution profile. Direct measurement of the mobile phase (ie. buffer) and elution peaks corresponding to the macromolecule(s) of interest enable a rapid and robust sample characterization following a well-defined sequence of data reduction procedures (20) .

            "text": "Unambiguous reconstruction of protein shape from a detergent solubilised MP is hampered by the strong scattering signal of bound detergent, typically forming a corona around the lipophilic trans-membrane region. The corona consists of hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, with significantly different scattering/electron densities. Thus the results of standard SAXS modelling procedures are, in such cases, non-realistic and ambiguous. Using complementary data from small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) including contrast matching approaches to isolate scattering from each solution component, the ambiguity of models calculated from detergent solubilised MPs can be reduced (21) (22) (23) (24) . It was recently shown that SANS data recorded at several contrast points together with an a priori estimate of detergent aggregation number, allow one to reliably reconstruct the shapes of MPs in detergent solutions (24) . In this publication it was suggested that a minimum of two SANS curves, collected under different contrast conditions, are required to obtain a stable solution. This requirement is necessary to isolate the signals from the two principal contributions to the scattering intensity, from the protein itself and from the hydrophillic part of the detergent corona. For this purpose the author developed an ab initio algorithm with a four-phase bead model for a protein: (1) protein, (2) detergent heads, (3) detergent tails, and (4) solvent (24) . An additional set of geometrical and symmetrical constraints was also required.",

Nevertheless, in view of the relative ease of access to X-ray facilities and lower sample consumption, compared to that of neutron sources, SAXS-based approaches to MP characterization are increasingly popular. A recent work on the tetrameric water-channel protein Aquaporin0 (25) showed that if an atomic structure of the protein is available, it is possible to reconstruct the entire complex by combining online SEC-SAXS with refractometry measurements. In that case, it was essential to use the available a priori information about the PDC in order to provide sufficient restraints on the model for a meaningful reconstruction. In the present paper we further formalize this approach and develop an automatic pipeline to build models of PDC utilizing a priori information taken from a dedicated database.",

The latter are used for the calculation of electron densities and approximate sizes of the detergent corona in the modelling. The electron density values can also be provided directly by the user for the cases when the automatic calculations are impossible or the values are not considered to be sufficiently accurate. Depending on the amount of a priori information, the pipeline decides whether it is possible to automatically reconstruct the model and, if so, builds it utilizing either the multiphase ab initio program MONSA (27) or the hybrid modelling program MEMPROT (28) . The starting parameters for the relevant fitting procedures are evaluated based on the available data stored in ISPyB, with the hybrid approach (25) executing upon detection of a high resolution protein component. In the absence of a high resolution protein structure the ab initio reconstruction is executed utilizing information about the amino-acid sequence of the MP, chemical formula of the detergent and additional data on the other solvent/solute components to assess the shape of the PDC.",

The primary data analysis is executed directly upon completion of a SEC-SAXS data acquisition and proceeds in the following workflow ( Figure. 1) Radial integration of 2D SAXS images by RADAVER (33) (typically 1000-3000 frames are collected for a standard SEC-SAXS run set with one second exposure per image/frame). 2) Determination of the buffer and sample ranges from the elution profile using CHROMIXS (35) , an important analysis component of the pipeline specifically designed for SEC-SAXS analysis. CHROMIXS automatically identifies both buffer and sample regions in the elution profile, and performs frame averaging and subtraction to produce the SAXS curve of the purified component for subsequent analysis (Figure 2 ). It is worth noting that CHROMIXS is capable of identifying multiple elution peaks, providing the users with a set of distinct SAXS curves from individual fractions, if present. 3) Calculation of the overall parameters (radius of gyration R g , maximum size D max , excluded volume V Porod , molecular weight MW) and the generation of relevant plots (Guinier plot: ln I(s) vs s 2 ; Kratky plot: I(s)s 2 vs s; and the real-space distance distribution function: P(r) vs r) for all subtracted curves. An example of these plots for the mechanosensitive T2 channel data is shown in the generated summary table (Figure. 3). These parameters are employed for the evaluation of the search volume to conduct the ab initio reconstruction using MONSA or for the hybrid MEMPROT fitting procedures. 4) Querying and collecting the available a priori information from the ISPyB database via dedicated Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) web services.

Although the hydrophobic tail of a detergent is typically slightly longer than its hydrophilic head, this assumption appears to be a reasonable first approximation for the further refinement. AMPP employs the MEMPROT minimization procedure, refining the starting parameters within a limited range, estimated empirically based on several tests conducted on different MPs. The a, b and t parameters are searched in the \u00b1 1/3(Tanford tail ) range, while ellipticity and rotation parameters are kept fixed in order to speed up the computations.

Knowledge of the detergent chemical formula is mandatory as it provides additional information to constrain the geometry of the MP model. When the high resolution models are not available, ab initio low resolution bead modeling is performed by MONSA (27), allowing for three phases with distinct contrasts corresponding to the protein (phase 1), detergent tails (phase 2) and detergent heads (phase 3). For each phase the contrast is calculated and the search space confined to a cylinder and two coaxial spherical hemi-tori ( Figure 5A ), thus avoiding contacts between the hydrophobic regions and solvent in the final model. A spherical region is fixed for the protein phase in the vicinity of the origin of coordinates, while the rest of the cylindrical region is free to become either protein or solvent. Penalties for the model discontinuity and looseness are applied during the simulated annealing procedure as described in the original paper (27) . Three additional boundary regions between the phases ( Figure 5A ) have a thickness of a few Angstrom allowing MONSA to select the optimum phase assignment during the fitting. The boundary beads (eg. between phases 1 and 2) are allowed to be assigned to either phase 1 or phase 2 ( Figure 5A ).

For example, it is often the case that the sample exists in solution as a mixture of different states (eg. multiple oligomeric states of a protein or complex), which are separated chromatographically. In this case, AMPP will determine the shapes of individual components in the mixture using the modeling path 3. The pipeline is therefore generally applicable.",

The single phase based model generated ab initio by DAMMIF (Fig. 6C) provides only the overall shape roughly approximating that of the protein-detergent complex. This reflects the limitation of the ab initio shape determination procedure, which must assume constant density inside the particle. The more information-rich multi-phase MONSA and MEMPROT models (Fig. 6B, A) display a good level of similarity, with the hybrid model generated using the latter program being more detailed and arguably having a higher resolution. For the multi-phase MONSA modeling path the starting cylindrical search volume used for protein-solvent phases was considerably larger than the final model and contains a spherical core with the fixed protein phase (green area shown in Figure 5B ). However, after the minimization procedure the volume occupied by the protein phase becomes only slightly larger than the central fixed spherical volume, and the MONSA models do display protrusions resembling the four \u03b1-helical \"legs\" expected for Aquaporin0. These models are similar to those generated using the hybrid modeling path with MEMPROT, where the protein structure is assumed to be known.",

The deviations observed at higher resolution ( Figure 7) reflect contributions from the detergents including the complex contrast situation, which is not accurately captured by the simplified modeling procedures used. This intentional simplification was justified for the sake of speed, such that preliminary models are generated that describe the gross structure of PDCs and do not attempt to describe internal inhomogeneties. One of the simplifications we implemented for the MEMPROT modeling was to assume a horizontal detergent torus with a circular geometry, and a fixed ellipticity e = 1. It should be stressed, that further model refinement is recommended in order to obtain more accurate and detailed models, using initial parameters suggested by the pipeline, and as necessary additional penalties as required (such as increased penalty for looseness and/or discontinuity, a higher number of experimental points and dummy beads in the MONSA grid, free ellipticity parameter for MEMPROT, etc). Similar results were obtained from the mechanosensitive channel T2 experimental data obtained at the P12 beamline (Figures 7b-8 ). There is a high degree of similarity between the three types of models generated, and interestingly, MONSA does reconstruct models with a void in the protein phase (green beads in Figure 8 ). This void is maintained also when an increased penalty for the bead discontinuity during minimization is introduced. Upon inspection, the high resolution model of a homologous structure, the MscS ion channel of T. tengcongensis (PDB: 3T9N) also displays a void in the extracellular domain of the structure. Thus the multiphase ab initio reconstruction reliably generates features consistent with those expected for the T2 ion channel. Figure. 8. Automatically reconstructed T2 models by the AMPP pipeline utilizing MEMPROT (hybrid modeling: 3T9N pdb model with found shape of detergent corona) (A), MONSA (multi-phase ab initio with P7 symmetry) (B) and DAMMIF (single phase ab initio, P7 symmetry) (C). The first row shows the side view cross-section of the PDC components that is represented with a section inside the detergent corona; protein beads are green for ab initio models and colored according to atom type for the hybrid model, detergent tails and heads are blue and red, respectively. The second and third rows represent the top and the side view of the models. The reconstructed MONSA model of the T2 channel protein fit the data reasonably well up to s = 0.25 \u00c5 -1 . The on-the-fly generated MEMPROT model fits only up to s = 0.09 \u00c5 -1 , which corresponds to the real-space resolution D = 2\u03c0/s ~ 60 \u00c5.",
