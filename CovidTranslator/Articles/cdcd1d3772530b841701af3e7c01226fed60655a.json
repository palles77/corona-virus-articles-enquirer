The carcasses of the bats negative for rabies were kept frozen at \uf02d80\u00b0C. A total of 120 bats were selected for necropsy, including 30 individuals for each of the following categories: juvenile male, juvenile female, adult male and adult female. The lungs and livers were dissected from the bats and pooled for virus purification and metagenomic sequencing according to previously described protocols (1,2). In short, virus particles were purified from the tissues using homogenization, filtration and nuclease treatment.",

A total of 100 thousand pyrosequences and 13.5 million Illumina sequences were generated. Sequences were trimmed and those sharing at least 95% nucleotide identities over 35 bases were assembled into contigs (3). Assembled contigs were compared to the GenBank non-redundant protein database using BLASTx with an E-value cutoff of 10 \uf02d4 (4).",

PCR primers were designed from metagenomic contigs using PRIMER3 (5) . PCRs were performed using LA Taq (Clontech) with reagent concentrations according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR reactions were carried out with a \"universal touch-down PCR\" suitable for the melting temperatures of all primers, as follows: 95\u00b0C for 5 min, 45 cycles of [94\u00b0C for 1 min, 58\u00b0C minus 0.2\u00b0C per cycle for 1 min, 72\u00b0C for 1 to 5 min], followed by 72\u00b0C for 10 min.

PCR primers ABVV-AF (5\uf0a2 6333 CGACCTGATGAGAGTGGTGA 3\uf0a2) and ABVV-AR (5\uf0a2 6795 AGTCGGGAGTTGATCATTGG 3\uf0a2) were used in PCR reactions targeting the polymerase gene of ABVV, producing an amplicon of 463 nt. The PCR reaction (containing 1 \u00b5M of each primer, 200 \u00b5M dNTPs, 1 U RedTaq DNA Polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich), 1X Red Taq Reaction Buffer, and 5 \u00b5l of target DNA in a 50 \u00b5l reaction) was carried out with the touch-down PCR conditions described above for genome completion. Amplicons were analyzed by ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis. For the mammalian-vesiculovirus-consensus PCR, two pairs of degenerate PCR primers were designed based on the sequence alignment of the polymerase gene of formally classified mammalian vesiculoviruses (Figure 1 in main text; Technical Appendix Figure 3).
