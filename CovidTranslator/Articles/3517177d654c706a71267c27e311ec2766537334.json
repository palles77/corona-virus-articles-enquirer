However, considering the truncated RNA oligonucleotide without the spacer region can form only a stem-loop conformation, the nearly identical UV melting profiles and melting temperatures for the two RNA oligonucleotides indicate indirectly that the RNA containing the spacer and the enhancer sequences adopts a stem-loop structure, but not a pseudoknot structure. In order to obtain structural information for the frameshifting sequence elements, enzymatic mapping of the RNA was done. Before probing the secondary structure of the RNA oligonucleotides using enzymatic mapping analysis, we tested for the presence of a single conformation in the samples by a native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 48C. Only one \u017d . band was observed on the native gel data not shown , indicating that the RNA oligonucleotides in 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl adopt a single conformation.

However, at a high enzyme concen-1 tration, some of the nucleotides in the region of G1 to G10 was cleaved by RNase V , suggesting that 1 residues 1 to 10 are partially stacked. Guanine residues G5-G7, and G9, which are located in the stem region of the proposed pseudoknot structure \u017d . Fig. 1c , were strongly attacked by RNase T that 1 cleaves the G in single-stranded region. These results indicate that residues 1-10 are in the single-stranded conformation. Nucleotides A24-A27 were cleaved This cleavage pattern, as summarized in Fig. 4 , indicates that in the context of the frameshifting sequence elements of the HIV-1 RNA consisting of the spacer and the enhancer, the enhancer sequence adopts a stem-loop structure separated from the shift site by a spacer sequence. It is not consistent with the formation of a pseudoknot. This stem-loop structure agrees with the absorbance melting results and is consistent with the calculated secondary structure from the Zuker algorithm. The spacer and the enhancer is solely folded into the stem-loop structure in Fig. 1b with a free energy of y21.1 kcal mol y1 .

In a cell culture analysis for the sequences and distance between two cis-acting signals in HIV-1 and HTLV-2, Kollmus et w x al. 11 observed that the slippery sequence alone is sufficient for basal level of frameshifting, but that the ( ) frameshifting efficiency is enhanced by a downstream stem-loop structure. A similar stimulating role of the stem-loop sequence in HIV-1 mRNA to enhance frameshifting was also observed in mammalian w x w x cell culture 16 . Honda et al. 17 used an in vitro luciferase assay system for HIV-1 translation frameshifting and noted that the stem-loop is not essential for basal-level frameshifting, but it does influence the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting. . \u017d T specific for single-strands , and for V specific for double- 1 1 . strands and stacked bases at a high concentration are consistent with a stem-loop.

Such a model predicts that the correct spacing must be maintained between the shift site and the downstream RNA structure. In analysis of the RNA sequences responsible for frameshifting in the avian corona virus infectious \u017d . w x bronchitis virus IBV , Brierley et al. 18 observed that alteration of the relative position of the shift sequence by as little as three nucleotides with the respect to the downstream pseudoknot causes a dramatic reduction in frameshifting efficiency. Morikawa w x and Bishop 19 also demonstrated for the gag-pol ribosomal frameshift site of feline immunodeficiency \u017d . virus FIV that mutations which alter the distance between the frameshift signal and the downstream pseudoknot structure reduces frameshifting efficiency. In a systematic analysis of the effect of the sequence and the distance between two signals on frameshifting efficiency in HTLV-II, Kollmus et al. w x X 11 demonstrated that the base composition 3 to the slippery sequence does not have a significant influence on frameshifting, but that the spacing between the slippery sequence and the 5 X end of the stem-loop is stringently restricted to an optimal distance of seven nucleotides.",

            "text": "All of these mutational results imply that the downstream RNA structure should be located at a precise position relative to the shift site to enhance frameshifting. In the viruses reported so far, the ( ) relative spacing distance between the stimulator and the slippery sequence varies between five and eight w x nucleotides 8 . Of course it is possible that the distance from the more efficient slippery sequence to the downstream RNA structure needs not be so tightly constrained. Since HIV-1 contains the highly slippery sequence UUUUUUA, the distance between two signals needs not be so stringently maintained, and the spacing may vary from three to nine nucleotides to promote different level of frameshifting; the maximum frameshifting efficiency is observed in the context of relative spacing between two signals separated w x by seven nucleotides 11 . Although a pseudoknot is the usual enhancer structure in retroviral frameshifting, there is no support for the proposed pseudoknot w x structure for HIV-1 by Du et al. 12 . In a recent w x paper, Du and Hoffman 20 mentioned that the possible pseudoknot structure for HIV-1 is speculative, since it lacks a spacing sequence between the frameshift site and the pseudoknot. The mutation data and our direct structural studies all agree that a stem-loop structure separated from the slippery sequence by about seven nucleotides is necessary for efficient ribosomal frameshifting in HIV-1.",
