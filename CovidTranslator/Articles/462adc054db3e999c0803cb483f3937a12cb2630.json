Though delirium may resolve during the hospital stay, what may be more serious is its association with longterm functional and cognitive impairment (Saczynski et al., 2012) .

Impairment of CA can lead to disturbances in CBF that could play a role in the occurrence of PD due to brain ischemia or hyper-perfusion causing edema and capillary damage (Paulson et al., 1990) . CA assessments are generally classified as being 'static' or 'dynamic' and can be performed by measuring CBF velocity of the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) with transcranial Doppler (TCD), simultaneously with BP (Tiecks et al., 1995) . Static CA represents the CBF dependence on BP under steady-state conditions. Dynamic CA reflects the transient response of CBF to sudden fluctuations in BP (Aaslid et al., 1989) . Worsening in CA efficiency has been shown to be associated with a wide range of cerebrovascular complications (Panerai, 2008) . Impaired cerebral microcirculation has been reported in patients with PD and the high vulnerability of these patients to changes on cerebral parenchyma make CA a potential factor that could be used to explain the occurrence of PD (H\u00e1la, 2007; Otomo et al., 2013) . Therefore, impairment on CA may be a marker for the development of delirium.",

Welch method was adopted for smoothing spectral estimates obtained with the fast Fourier transform (102.4 s segments, 50% superposition). Using the inverse fast Fourier transform, the CBFV response to a step change in BP was also derived and compared with 10 template curves proposed by Tiecks et al. (1995) to estimate the autoregulation index (ARI) ). Measurements were rejected if coherence did not reach 0.5 for any frequency below 0.25 Hz. Coherence is part of TFA, and represents the fraction of output power (CBFV variability) that can be linearly explained by the corresponding input power (ABP variability) at each frequency (Claassen and Meel-van, 2016) . This parameter varies between zero and 1, and can be interpreted similarly to a correlation coefficient. Coherence will approach zero if the signal-to-noise ratio of measurements is too low, if the input-output relationship is non-linear, or if there are other variables influencing CBFV. In general, the 95% confidence limit of coherence is used to determine acceptance of parameters derived by TFA (Claassen and Meel-van, 2016) .",

Before surgery, dynamic CA was impaired (ARI < 4) in 12 (17.9%) patients, but this number increased to 37 patients at T2 (55.2%) with 14 patients (35.8%) still manifesting impaired CA at T3 (p < 0.001) (Supplementary Table S2 ). These differences in ARI were confirmed by the corresponding CBFV step responses (Fig. 1) , reflecting the effect of a sudden BP change, with a much slower recovery towards baseline at T2 in comparison with T1 and T3.",

Of considerable relevance, predictive models before and after surgery indicate that assessment of CA could help to identify patients at higher risk of PD, eventually contributing to better prevention and reduction in the number and duration of episodes of delirium. This study adds to the existing literature on cerebral hemodynamic abnormalities in cardiac surgery. CBFV and CA have been assessed during cardiac surgery (Ono et al., 2012; Easley et al., 2013) , but the effects on dynamic CA before and after cardiac surgery have not been reported. These studies suggested that CA might be impaired during cardiac surgery, but our results demonstrated that CA impairment is also present in 57% of patients up to 24 h post-surgery.",

These results may have been influenced by the relatively small sample size and the use of transfer function analysis limited to gain and phase Panerai, 2008) . In our study, we calculated CA by ARI (Tiecks et al., 1995) . The ARI incorporates all the gain and phase information, which are then aggregated and summarized into a single value. In this way, if smaller differences in gain and/ or phase are not enough to lead to statistically significant differences, their aggregated effect, as part of the non-linear transformation involved in estimating the ARI (Tiecks et al., 1995) and lead to the ARI being significantly different. On the other hand, based on a larger patient group, Hori et al reported that reduced CA efficacy was associated with delirium, but in their study CA was assessed only during CPB (Hori et al., 2014) . Our larger study, using ARI as a more robust index of CA (incorporating both gain and phase information), confirms that dynamic CA is impaired following cardiac surgery.

Our results add to the existing literature about predisposing factors for delirium, we found that lower ARI before surgery was a risk factor and predictor of PD after cardiac surgery. Under normal physiological conditions, CA counteracts the changes in systemic blood pressure that occur during daily activities and several studies have shown a link between ARI impairment and cerebrovascular conditions (Panerai, 2008; Salinet et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2016) , but ARI analysis before cardiac surgery has not been previously reported. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this finding, nevertheless, identifying this group of patients is an important first step in critical care of the perioperative period to prevent PD or reduce its duration.",

Evidence of this susceptibility is provided by previous neurophysiological studies demonstrating major differences in the EEG of patients with PD following cardiothoracic surgery (van der Kooi et al., 2015) . Importantly, the contribution of CA has considerable potential to improve existing models for the prediction of PD that have not included cerebral hemodynamic parameters (Rudolph et al., 2009; Luetz et al., 2016; Mailhot et al., 2016) and therefore warrants further investigation.",
