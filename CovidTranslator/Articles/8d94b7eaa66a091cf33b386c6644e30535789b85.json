A recently published intervention study from the Netherlands has confirmed the critical role of hospital staff in the prevalence of influenza in adult inpatients at university medical centers, as well as the preventive effect of vaccinating the healthcare workers against influenza (3). For emerging infections, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus or respiratory syncytial virus, nosocomial transmission is also well documented.",

The study reported by Giannella et al., which our correspondents cite, can at best be regarded as a pilot study: in 31 of 105 intubated patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection, whose endotracheal aspirates were sent for analysis, influenza was identified during the flu season. But this had been acquired nosocomially in only 13 cases; furthermore, the manuscript does not provide any information on how many of the subjects did have pneumonia (2) . We hope that more published data on the subject will be available by the time the updated guideline is published, at the end of 2014.",
