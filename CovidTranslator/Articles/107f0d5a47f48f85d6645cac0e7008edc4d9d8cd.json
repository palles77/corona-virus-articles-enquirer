With its deep history devoted to explaining the abundance and distribution of organisms, ecology can augment current methods for studying viral dynamics. However, datasets allowing ecological explorations of viral communities are lacking, and common methods for delineating viral operational taxonomic units (OTUs), or \"species\", are subjective. Here, we comprehensively sampled 1,086 bats from two Puerto Rican caves and tested them for infection with herpesviruses. Using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm, we categorized herpesviruses into 41 OTUs, representing approximately 80% of all herpesviruses in the host community. Although 13 OTUs were detected in multiple host species, OTUs generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all other species combined. Only two OTUs showed significantly different prevalence between host sexes. This work is the first exploration of viral community ecology in a community of wildlife hosts.

Ecology has a long history of quantifying the abundance and distribution of organisms and has been increasingly integrated into viral studies (Anthony et al. 2015 , Seabloom et al. 2015 . Traditionally, such efforts have focused on isolated cases of single host-single pathogen relationships (Telfer et al. 2010) . However, infected host individuals generally have multiple pathogens, and infection with one pathogen can affect infection, virulence, or disease emergence of the others (Pedersen and Fenton 2006 , Jolles et al. 2008 , Telfer et al. 2010 , Seabloom et al. 2015 . This suggests that perspectives and approaches from community ecology can complement current methods in virology.",

            "text": "Three major challenges exist when integrating community ecology and virology. First, most viruses are rare (i.e. exist at low prevalence; Tang et al. 2006 , Winker et al. 2008 , Wacharapluesadee et al. 2010 , Anthony et al. 2015 , so the probability of infection in a host individual is low. Consequently, large datasets of comprehensively sampled host populations are needed to address high levels of uncertainty associated with low viral prevalence. Few such datasets exist. Second, most wildlife viruses are unknown to science (Anthony et al. 2013 , Anthony et al. 2017 , Carlson et al. 2019 , and the process of defining viral species is timeconsuming (King et al 2012) . This means that waiting for official designations of viral species for use in community-level analyses does not address the urgency of current health challenges posed by wildlife viruses. Alternatives to official designation of viral species include delineating operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using monophyletic groups (Anthony et al 2015) or percent identity histograms (Maes et al. 2009 , Anthony et al. 2017 ). However, both such methods rely on subjectively chosen cutoff points to differentiate OTUs. Finally, many viral infections last only hours to days, making detection difficult (Klenk et al. 2004, Lee et al. 2009, Henaux and Samuel Herpesviruses are large, enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect all vertebrate classes and mollusks (King et al. 2012 , Azab et al. 2018 . In contrast to many viruses, herpesviruses generally occur at high prevalence (Cone et al. 1993 , Kidd et al. 1996 , Cortez et al. 2008 , Imbronito et al. 2008 , Tenorio de Franca et al. 2012 , Phalen et al. 2017 , Tazikeh et al. 2019 , and they establish latent, long-term (often for the entirety of the host's life)",

For each OTU that infected more than one host individual, viral preference for host sex was examined by comparing OTU prevalence between male and females of the core host species, using Fisher's exact test. All analyses were done using R version 3.4.3, and code used for all methods can be found at github.com/ARSjodin. OTU Delineation: Both alignment techniques resulted in two similar, clearly differentiated potential cutoff ranges, as demonstrated by consistent peaks in the histograms (Figure 1 ). The lower level of taxonomic grouping of OTUs was defined as those with a cutoff between 90 -92%. This means that two sequences with less than 90% genetic similarity would be considered to be different OTUs. The higher level of taxonomic grouping was defined as those with a cutoff between 74 and 80%. As such, two sequences with less than 74% genetic similarity would be considered to be different OTUs. The number of OTUs resulting from the cutoff extremes for both levels of classification, when total alignment and pairwise alignment were considered (74, 81, 90 and 93 PID cutoffs; Figure 1 ), were 29, 31, 42, and 47 OTUs, respectively.",

While some surveys (e.g. Cone et al. 1993 , Kidd et al. 1996 , Phalen et al. 2017 show Generally, herpesviruses are highly host specific, but when host-virus relationships are examined at an evolutionary timescale, host switching has been the norm (Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2016 , Azab et al. 2018 . As such, we expected herpesviruses that infected multiple host species to have core hosts. Overall, we found evidence of host sharing among bat species at Mata de Pl\u00e1tano Nature Reserve, regardless of cave. The existence of host sharing is further supported by viral prevalence and viral discovery curves. A higher prevalence at the populationlevel (i.e. a single species) than the community-level, as seen here (Table 2) , is consistent with host-specificity. Also, at the largest scale (i.e. the entire nature reserve), sampling completeness reached 80%. This is in contrast to accumulation curves for viral metacommunities infecting particular host populations, which were as low as 55% (P. quadridens). This suggests that undiscovered OTUs at the scale of host population have already been discovered at the scale of nature reserve (i.e. have already been discovered in another host species).

Future studies with goals of monitoring public health should increase the number of sampled individuals for each host species to enhance the likelihood of uncovering patterns of host preference and reservoir status. Studies aimed at viral ecology will likely require focus on more prevalent viral taxa, such as herpesviruses, instead of rare viral taxa of more zoonotic concern, such as coronaviruses or filoviruses. Further ecological research should prioritize sampling host individuals from multiple field locations, addressing viral infection and transmission at multiple spatial scales, while decoupling the spatial and ecological mechanisms that shape viral community assembly.",

The x-axis represents the percent identity of clone sequences compared pairwise. The y-axis represents the number of clone sequences. Vertical lines represent cutoff points corresponding to two distinct peaks, with blue lines representing the higher-level cutoff and the red lines representing the lower-level cutoff. Solid lines represent the low end of the cutoff ranges, and the dashed lines represent the upper end of the cutoff ranges. The distinct peaks are consistent regardless of alignment method. .

OTUs are named to reflect manual refinement of OTUs after affinity propagation. For example, affinity propagation separated OTU 28, a gammaherpesvirus, into four separate clusters. However, the similarity of the exemplars suggested that these clusters should all be grouped into a single OTU. These trees provide biological support for the manual refinement of OTUs. OTUs 39-41, all betaherpesviruses, were not included in the tree. These OTUs were represented by three highly divergent sequences (< 50% genetic similarity), and their inclusion in the tree impaired visualization of all other relationships.",

Empirical viral richness per metacommunity (S) is depicted by red triangles.

Although multiple methods exist for delineating OTUs (e.g. histograms using percent genetic identity, Maes et al. 2009; or monophyletic groups, Anthony et al. 2015), subjectivity is generally required to choose the best cutoff point in terms of genetic similarity (i.e. the histogram method) or evolutionary time (i.e. the monophyletic groups method). Affinity propagation is a machinelearning algorithm developed to cluster a broad range of data (e.g. images of faces, genes in a microarray, heavily travelled cities) and identify representative examples of each cluster (Frey and Dueck 2007). The method has been used to cluster strains of rabies viruses (Fischer et al. 2017",

The 13 bat species on the island are well-documented and have been studied extensively (Gannon et al. 2005). Mata de Pl\u00e1tano Nature Reserve (operated by InterAmerican University, Bayamon, Puerto Rico) is in the north-central, karstic region of the island, an area dominated by a multitude of caves that are suitable for roosting bats. Culebrones Cave is structurally complex and hot, with temperatures reaching 40\u00b0 C and relative humidity at 100%. It is home to an estimated 300,000 individual bats representing six species: Pteronotus quadridens, P. portoricensis, Mormoops blainvillii, Monophyllus redmani, Erophylla sezekorni, and Brachyphylla cavernarum (Rodr\u00edguez-Duran 2009). Bats were sampled for 28 nights between June and August 2017. A harp trap was placed at sunset (approximately 18:00) immediately outside of the opening, and monitored continually. Larva Cave is cooler (ambient temperature), smaller, and less structurally complex compared to Culebrones Cave.
