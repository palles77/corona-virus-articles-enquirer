We have previously shown 23 that Bcl-2 inhibits cell cycle progression from the G 0 /G 1 to the S phase after serum 24 starvation, and that quiescent Bcl-2 expressing cells maintained a significant lower 25 level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the control cells.

Our cell cycle profiles showed that both 3T3PB and 3T3Bcl-2 were 87 arrested successfully in G 0 /G 1 phase, the proportion of cells in S phase dropped from 88 ~20% (normal growing, NG) to less than 3% (serum starved, SS) for both cells (Fig. 89 1A and 1B). We also observed a significant elevation in p27 levels in SS3T3Bcl-2 90 cells, confirming that Bcl-2 function as tumor-repressive gene through upregulating 91 p27 ( Fig. 1C and 1D ). At this stage, PGC-1\u03b1 expression was clearly increased in 92 SS3T3Bcl-2 comparing with NG3T3Bcl-2 cells, while there was no significant 93 difference between control cells SS3T3PB and NG3T3PB ( Fig. 1C and 1E ). This 94 result suggests that PGC-1\u03b1 expression associates with Bcl-2 after serum depletion. Fig. 1 and 2) , suggesting a relationship between PGC-1\u03b1 and Bcl-2. We hypothesized 187 that Bcl-2 may recruit and rely on PGC-1\u03b1 to reduce ROS, which mediated cell cycle 188 as a critical signal. To test this possibility, Bcl-2 knockdown by siRNA was performed, 189 and as we expected, PGC-1\u03b1 expression was correspondingly decreased (Fig.3) . 190 Together with the facts that PGC-1\u03b1 regulates mitochondrial function to eliminate 191 ROS, and arrested Bcl-2 cells contain less ROS, these results suggest that Bcl-2 might 192 recruit PGC-1\u03b1 to reduce ROS levels and block cell cycle progression. 193 To further clarify the relationship between Bcl-2 and PGC-1\u03b1, we investigated the 194 influence of PGC-1\u03b1 knockdown on Bcl-2 expression.

Bcl-2 acts as an anti-tumor gene in early 44 stage solid tumors, where it significantly reduces tumor incidence by regulating the 45 cell cycle (Vail et al., 2001; Murphy et al., 1999). In vitro cell studies demonstrated 46 that the most pronounced cell cycle effect of Bcl-2 is delay of progression to S phase 47 from G0/G1 (Janumyan et al., 2008; Janumyan et al., 2003), which has also been 48 confirmed in a Bcl-2 transgenic mouse model, where proliferation of lymphoid T cells 49 was restrained and tumor-associated morbidity was significantly decreased (Cheng et 50 al., 2004).

Consistent with the results from the SS method (Fig. Fig. 2A and 2B), PGC-1\u03b1 and p27 expression increased significantly in 100 CI3T3Bcl-2 compared to either NG3T3Bcl-2 or CI3T3PB cells, whereas, PGC-1\u03b1 101 expression did not significantly change between 3T3PB and CI3T3PB cells (Fig. 102 2C-2E). Based on the combined results from SS (Fig. 1) and CI (Fig. 2) treatment, we 103 conclude that during serum starvation, Bcl-2 delay cell cycle progress and the effects of Bcl-2 knockdown on PGC-1\u03b1 using glioma U251 109 cells, which have high Bcl-2 and PGC-1\u03b1 endogenous expression. Three specific 110 siRNAs (506, 528, and 928) were used to interfere with Bcl-2 expression in U251 111 cells, while a GAPDH siRNA and a mimic siRNA were used as a positive control and 112 negative control (NC), respectively (Fig. 3A). Western blot confirmed successful 113 Bcl-2 knockdown by all three specific siRNAs, without interfere on positive or 114 negative controls (Fig.3B). PGC-1\u03b1 expression was decreased significantly in cells 115 transfected with siRNAs fragment 528 and 928 than 526 which showing correlates with PGC-1\u03b1 downregulation in U251 cells after 121 SS treatment 122 Next, we investigated whether Bcl-2 was regulated by PGC-1\u03b1. Human glioma 123 cell line U251 has high endogenous expression of PGC-1\u03b1 and Bcl-2, so we chose 124 these cells to knockdown PGC-1\u03b1 and check the effects on Bcl-2. U251 cells were 125 treated by SS for 24, 48, and 72 h, and normal growing (NGU251) cells were used as 126 a control. The results showed that during SS treatment, S phase cells dropped down 127 (Fig. 4A and 4B), Bcl-2 was upregulated following PGC-1\u03b1 downregulation (Fig. 4C). 128 These results suggested that Bcl-2 responds to PGC-1\u03b1 in a negative way. 129 130 Bcl-2 was upregulated following PGC-1\u03b1 knockdown 131 To further test the relation between PGC-1\u03b1 and Bcl-2, experiments with siRNA 132 targeting PGC-1\u03b1 were performed. Fig. 5A shows that PGC-1\u03b1 was significantly 133 decreased in cells transfected with siRNA, while no change was found in cells 134 transfected with the negative control (NC), positive control (GAPDH) or the 135 transfection reagent only (Fig. 5B), confirming the successful PGC-1\u03b1 knockdown. 136Western blotting analysis showed that Bcl-2 expression was significantly increased 137 after knockdown of PGC-1\u03b1(Fig. 5C). Based on these results and those shown in we conclude that Bcl-2 is negatively regulated by PGC-Bcl-2 gene was first identified in tumor cells of follicular lymphoma142 patients, and was localized near the junction at which chromosomes 18 and 14 (t14;18) 143 are joined (Tsujimoto et al., 1984). This chromosome translocation led to upregulation 144 of Bcl-2 expression and contributed to cancer (Tsujimoto et al., 1985; Nunez et al., 145 1989). As an oncogene, Bcl-2 can inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival, et al., 1993). However, the anti-tumor function of Bcl-2 is still not fully 150 understood. Our group discovered that Bcl-2 could retard cell cycle progression 151 through inhibiting p27 protein degradation (Janumyan et al., 2008; Du et al.the control cells. However, there were no differences in ROS levels 157 between normal growing Bcl-2 overexpressing cells and control cells. This is 158 consistent with the fact that Bcl-2's anti-tumor function was activated only in G 0 /G 1 159 stage after serum starvation but not in normal growing status (Janumyan et al., 2008). 160 Taken together, these results strongly indicate that ROS might play a role in Bcl-2's 161 cell cycle function (Du et al., 2017). Mitochondrial OXPHOS impinges on many 162 cellular functions, including energy allocation and programmed cell death. ROS 163 generated by mitochondrial OXPHOS provide a signaling system from mitochondria 164 to the nucleus (Hansen et al., 2006), and are involved in cell cycle regulation, with 165 low levels of ROS suppressing cellular growth and proliferation (Burdon et al., 1995; 166 Vander Heiden et al., 2009). Bcl-2 was reported to have anti-oxidant effects as a ROS 167 scavenger, but it lacks the sequence or structural features of known anti-oxidant 168 proteins, suggesting that Bcl-2 might clear ROS by modulating mitochondrial 169 bioenergetics (Nathan et al., 2009). 170 PGC-1\u03b1 is a transcriptional co-activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated 171 receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) that regulates transcription factor activity, and has a central 172 place in multiple cellular processes, including mitochondrial respiration and 173 OXPHOS (Alessia et al., 2010). PGC-1\u03b1 responds to metabolic challenges such as 174 exercise, starvation or cold; its expression is induced by these environmental stimuli 175 and is associated with cancer (Yoon et al., 2001). We previously reported that as hypothesis, we experimented with embryonic fibroblast NIH3T3 cells, in 180 which Bcl-2 was either overexpressed or silenced, and which were arrested by SS or 181 CI to activate the cell cycle function of Bcl-2. We observed that during serum 182 starvation, the expression of p27 was increased significantly in G 0 /G 1 arrested Bcl-2 183 overexpressing cells compared to control cells, which validated the cell cycle function 184 of Bcl-2 (Janumyan et al., 2008; Janumyan et al., 2003; Cheng et al., 2004). PGC-1\u03b1 185 was elevated as well in arrested Bcl-2 overexpressing cells but not in control cells 186 (",

Fig. 5 shows that Bcl-2 expression was upregulated after 199 PGC-1\u03b1 was successfully silenced. Consistent with this result, Bcl-2 was upregulated 200 following PGC-1\u03b1 downregulation during the SS treatment (Fig. 4). These results 201 suggest a negative feedback between Bcl-2 and PGC-1\u03b1 expression. Recently, the 202 network between Bcl-2 and PGC-1\u03b1 received intensive attentions due to their 203 involvement in various types of cancers. In human musculoskeletal tumor cell lines, 204 overexpression of PGC-1\u03b1 increase mitochondrial numbers, which induce apoptosis 205 (Onishi et al., 2014). Consistence with that work, Zhang et al. leads to apoptosis in human endometrial cancer cells (Yang et al., 210 2016). These findings suggested that PGC-1\u03b1 play important roles through 211 mitochondrial pathway with different patterns in various tumors. In present study, we 212 elucidate the communication between PGC-1\u03b1 and Bcl-2, mainly focusing on the 213 anti-tumor function of Bcl-2 instead of its apoptosis role. 214 Elaborating on the possible mechanism of Bcl-2 on anti-tumor function is very 215 important. Many studies have confirmed ATP and ROS were key signals in regulating 216 cell cycle. Although it is known that Bcl-2 was involved in regulating cell cycle by 217 ROS pathway, the mechanism of how Bcl-2 regulates the ROS pathway remains 218 unclear. Bcl-2 lacks sequence or structural features of known anti-oxidant proteins 219 (Nathan et al., 2009), suggesting that Bcl-2 indirectly controls ROS via other factors. 220 PGC-1\u03b1 was identified as a crucial switch on mitochondrial oxidative 221 phosphorylation (Alessia et al., 2010), and function to diminish ROS (St-Pierre et al., 222 2006; Fu et al., 2016). 223 Based on our current study, we concluded that when Bcl-2 over-expressing cells 224 (as most of the tumor cells) are confronting serum depletion, PGC-1\u03b1 is activated, it 225 might bind to Bcl-2 to inhibit cell cycle and suppress tumor cell proliferation through 226 reducing ROS. Further study needs to be done to determine whether PGC-1\u03b1 directly 227 associate with Bcl-2 protein to control cell cycle. These findings revealed the 228 communication between the mitochondria and the nuclear genes, epithelial 293T cells and human glioma U251 cells (with high Bcl-2 234 and PGC-1\u03b1 endogenous expression) were supplied by the Biochemistry tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche, Basel, Swiss) were added in 245 DMEM, mixed gently, and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The mixture 246 was added drop-wise into 293T cells in a 10 cm plate. After 48 h, the supernatant 247 containing pBABEpuro-Bcl-2 virus was collected and filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm 248 filter. NIH3T3 cells were then infected with the virus. After 48 h of culture, the 249 aminoglycoside antibiotic puromycin (Gibco-BRL, Carlsbad, USA) was added into 250 the medium at final concentration of 4 \u03bc g/mL to select NIH3T3 cells with stable 251 expression of Bcl-2. Bcl-2 expression was confirmed by western blotting. 252 253 Cell cycle synchronization and analysis by flow cytometry 254 For cell synchronization via SS, U251 or NIH3T3 cells were washed three times 255 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cultured for 48 h in medium containing no 256 FBS (U251 cells) or containing 0.1% calf serum (NIH3T3 cells). For cell 257 synchronization via CI, the cells were allowed to reach confluence and then 258 maintained in culture for 5 days. Synchronized cells by either method were harvested, 259 washed with cold PBS, and incubated with a solution containing 50 \u03bc g/mL propidium 260 iodide (PI) and 0.03% TritonX-100 at room temperature for 20 min. For each sample, 261 at least 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells/mL were analyzed with a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD 262 Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Cell cycle profiles were calculated using the C6 software. 12.5% polyacrylamide gel for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel 271 electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) 272 membrane at constant voltage (100 V) for 2 h. The membrane was then blocked with 273 5% milk and probed with primary antibody (at 1:1,000 dilution) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. 274 After being washed 3 times with PBST (phosphate buffer saline with triton x-100), 275 the membrane was incubated with a secondary antibody (1:2,000 dilution) at room 276 temperature for 2 h, and the signal was developed with an enhanced 277 chemiluminescence kit (Thermoscientific, Boston, USA).
