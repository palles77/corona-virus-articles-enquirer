Some of them, such as the Gray, Holte [7] , and Australian T strain [2] have been reported to cause nephritis and nephrosis. Recently, there have been frequent IBV outbreaks in Japan characterized by following signs: depression, dehydration, diarrhea, and death. The kidneys of those chickens were swollen with prominent tubules and the ureters distended, which were diagnosed as a tubutointerstitial nephritis.",

It is necessary, therefore, for employing the appropriate vaccine strains to survey and determine prevalent IBV strains using a rapid and reliable method. Recently, we developed a new typing method for IBV using PCR and RFLP 1-6] which provide the information as to whether these currently prevalent strains are similar to or different from current vaccine strains. This method is based on amplification of a 400 base pairs (bp) DNA fragment derived from the Nterminal region of S 2 glycopotypeptide gene and comparison of their restriction enzyme digestion patterns and was able to classify IBV isolates in several groups.",

HinfI digested pUC 19 DNA was used as the molecular size markers (3//), and their sizes are indicated in base pairs (bp) on the left In this study, essentially the same procedure was used in an attempt to characterize four IBV isolates F-88, Y-4, M-l, and NI-1 from chickens with nephritis in different endemic areas of Japan between 1988 and 1989. Three of them, F-88, M-l, and NI-1, were obtained from affected kidneys, while Y-4 was from a gizzard, cDNA fragments of the four isolates were amplified by PCR. The amplified DNAs comigrated exactly in a 1.5% agarose gel, giving an identical size approximately 400 bp corresponding to the length between the two primers ( Fig. 1 ). This indicates that the amplified region was well conserved without apparent deletion or insertion.",

Figure 2 shows the representative cleavage patterns of the amplified DNA of M-1 and Y-4 isolates. The DNA of M-1 was cleaved at one site by all of the restriction enzymes, except HpaII and PstI (Fig. 2 a) . The DNA of Y-4 DNA was cleaved at two sites by ScaI and at one site by MaelII, XhoII, DdeI, and HincII (Fig. 2 b) . The differences in cleavage sites between the two isolates are shown in HinfI, ScaI, and HaeIII digestion. The DNA from the other two isolates, F-88 and NI-1, gave an identical cleavage pattern with that of the M-1 isolate, indicating that these three isolates are closely related to each other, and may be derived from a common origin (data not shown). To facilitate the classification of strains, a pairwise comparison of cleavage sites was performed. There are 17 cleavage sites by 9 restriction enzymes as shown in Fig. 3 . For each pair of strains, the difference in restriction sites was counted (0-17). The results with four new isolates and previously defined 12 strains were schematically illustrated in Fig. 4 . The four new isolates are obviously closer with each other than with the other 12 strains which previously classified (group I-V) [6] , and therefore classified into a new distinct group (VI).",
