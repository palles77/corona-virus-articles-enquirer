Tonsils are enlarged and red, with patchy exudates on their surfaces. The papillae of the tongue may be red and swollen, leading to the designation, \"strawberry tongue.\" Tender, enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes often are found. Combinations of these signs assist in diagnosis; tonsillar exudates in association with palatal petechiae and tender anterior cervical adenitis strongly suggest group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Very often, some or all of these classic characteristics are absent in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis.

The scarlet fever rash has a texture that feels similar to sandpaper and blanches with pressure. Beginning on the face, it becomes generalized after 24 hours. The area around the mouth often appears pale in comparison to the extremely red cheeks, giving the appearance of circumoral pallor. Accentuation of erythema occurs in flexor skin creases, especially in the antecubital fossae (Pastia's sign or Pastia's lines). The erythema begins to fade within a few days, and within a week of onset desquamation occurs, first on the face, progressing downward, and often resembling that seen subsequent to a mild sunburn. Occasionally, sheetlike desquamation occurs around the free margins of the finger nails, usually more coarse than the desquamation seen with Kawasaki disease.

When performed by experienced personnel, these rapid diagnostic tests (rapid strep antigen tests) are highly specific (generally > 95%), using the throat culture as the standard. Specificity reflects the percentage of positive results that come from patients who truly harbor group A streptococci. Unfortunately, the sensitivity (the percentage of true-positives that are identified by group A antigen detection) of most of these rapid tests is problematic.

Cultures were never or almost never obtained by 23% of the physicians surveyed. This survey also found that pediatricians were more likely than internists or family/general practitioners to use throat cultures. In 1993, Schwartz et a116 surveyed pediatricians about their diagnostic approaches to children with pharyngitis. An optimal approach, defined as use of culture alone or as a backup to a negative rapid antigen test for at least 80% of patients, was used by 44% of pediatricians who responded to the survey. Seventeen percent reported using clinical findings or rapid test without culture for most children with pharyngitis. We obtained similar results from a recent national survey of U.S. pediatricians; 64% used rapid tests at least some of the time, 42% used throat cultures whenever the rapid test was negative, 38% used cultures alone, and 20% used strategies that are not recommended. 17 Thus, it appears that many physicians do not follow recommended guidelines for diagnosing streptococcal pharyngitis.",

A small proportion of these patients remain symptomatic and are thus characterized as \"clinical treatment failures.\" Reinfection with the same or a different strain of group A streptococcus is possible, as is intercurrent viral pharyngitis. Some patients may have been noncompliant with therapy, but apparent treatment failure occurs even among patients treated with intramuscular benzathine penicillin. 34,35 Some of these patients are chronic pharyngeal carriers of group A streptococci and suffer from a new superimposed viral infection (Fig 2) . Most patients with bacteriologic treatment failure are asymptomatic and are identified when follow-up cultures are obtained, a practice that generally is unnecessary. Patients who are compliant with therapy are at minimal risk for ARF. 36 There is some evidence that bacteriologic failure rates may be somewhat lower when antibiotics other than penicillin are used, especially the cephalosporins. 3739 Although numerous studies of various cephalosporins have been published, few studies have been large enough or have been performed rigorously enough to prove that this class of antimicrobials is superior to penicillin; all of the antibiotics have treatment failure associated with their use. Published metanalyses suffer from the poor quality of many of the included studies. 39 Semisynthetic derivatives of penicillin (such as dicloxicillin), rifampin given with oral penicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, and other drugs also have been used.

Streptococcal antibody titers often are elevated in carriers, hut neither these elevated titers nor quantitative throat cultures have proved useful. 36 The clinician should consider the possibility of chronic streptococcal carriage when a patient has multiple culturepositive episodes of pharyngitis, especially when symptoms are mild or atypical. A culture obtained when the suspected carrier is symptom-free or is receiving treatment with penicillin (intramuscular benzathine penicillin is recommended to eliminate the possibility of noncompliance) usually is positive for group A streptococci.

Physician and patient anxiety is common and can develop into \"streptophobia\" on the part of both. Unproven and generally untested therapies for carriers often are encountered.

The two treatment regimens that have been demonstrated to be effective are: (1) intramuscular benzathine penicillin plus oral rifampin (10 mg/kg/dose up to 300 mg, administered twice daily for 4 days beginning on the day of the penicillin injection)34; and (2) oral clindamycin given for 10 days (20 mg/kg/ day up to 450 mg, divided into three equal doses). 53 We currently prefer clindamycin because it is easier to use than intramuscular penicillin plus oral rifampin and may be somewhat more effective. No other antibiotic regimens have been demonstrated in controlled, comparative trials to reliably terminate the chronic streptococcal carrier state. Successful eradication of the carrier state makes evaluation of subsequent episodes of pharyngitis much easier, although we have seen chronic carriage recur on reexposure to group A streptococci.",

Appropriate antibiotic treatment of each episode results in resolution of symptoms and eradication of the microorganism. Follow-up throat culture may be needed to distinguish recurrent acute streptococcal pharyngitis from frequent nonstreptococcal pharyngitis in patients who are chronic carriers. The reasons for frequent episodes ofbonafide acute streptococcal pharyngitis are obscure, but lack of flora, especially alpha streptococci, capable of inhibiting group A streptococci, or unusual mucosal adherence to group A streptococci, are intriguing concepts. Studies of nasal spraying of alpha streptococci to prevent recurrent acute pharyngitis are ongoing in Sweden. 54 The role of tonsillectomy in managing patients with multiple episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis remains controversial. Paradise et a155 demonstrated fewer episodes of sore throat among children treated with tonsillectomy (compared to patients treated without surgery) but only during the first 2 years after the operation. The patients enrolled in that study had experienced numerous episodes of pharyngitis, but not all episodes of sore throat were caused by group A streptococci (a fact often missed when this study is dited). Of particular concern are the reported tonsillectomy complication rate of 14% and the improvement over time noted among the patients who did not undergo tonsillectomy. Finally, it is clear that the presence of tonsils is not necessary for streptococci to infect the throat. Tonsillectomy cannot be recommended at present except in unusual circumstances.",

Influenza virus infections may cause fever, cough, headache, malaise, myalgias, and cervical adenopathy, in addition to pharyngitis. Adenoviruses can cause fever, cervical lymph node enlargement, pharyngeal erythema, follicular hyperplasia of the tonsils, and exudate.

Symptoms resolve within a few days. Enteroviruses cause two specific syndromes that involve the oropharynx. Herpangina caused by Coxsackie viruses A and B or echovirus is characterized by distinctive discrete, painful, gray-white papulovesicular lesions distributed over the posterior oropharypx. The vesicles are 1 to 2 mm in diameter and are surrounded initially by a halo of erythema, then ulcerate. Fever may reach 39.5~ Coxsackie virus A16 causes hand-foot-mouth disease. Painful vesicles that may ulcerate can occur throughout the oropharynx. Vesicles also develop on the palms and soles and sometimes on the trunk or extremities. Fever is present in most cases, but many children do not appear ill. Primary infection with herpes simplex virus usually produces high fever with acute gingivostomatitis in young children. Vesicles (which become ulcers) develop throughout the anterior portion of the mouth, including the lips, but the posterior pharynx is spared. High fever is common and pain is intense; intake of oral fluids often is impaired and may lead to dehydration. Herpetic gingivostomatitis may last up to 2 weeks.",
