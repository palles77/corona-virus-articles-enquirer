            "text": "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an acute immune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating condition involving the brain and spinal cord, which presents clinically with new-onset polyfocal neurologic features, which by definition include encephalopathy. 1 The MRI shows characteristic multifocal demyelinating abnormalities. There is often a history of infection or immunization, and ADEM is considered a postinfectious/parainfectious condition. This condition is a common cause of encephalitis in children and must be considered in the differential diagnosis of a child presenting with acute febrile encephalopathy and altered sensorium with or without fever. Children with ADEM respond well to immunosuppressive treatment (steroids) with the majority having a single event, i.e., a monophasic course. A small proportion of children with ADEM may have relapses, and in this subset, multiple sclerosis (MS) is a diagnostic consideration. In this chapter we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, investigations, treatment, and outcome of ADEM in children.",

Brain MRI is abnormal during the acute (3 months) phase. 5. Typically on brain MRI, there are diffuse poorly demarcated, large (>1-2 cm) lesions involving predominantly the cerebral white matter. T1 hypointense lesions in the white matter are rare. Deep gray matter lesions (e.g., thalamus or basal ganglia lesions) can be present. If a child has a first monofocal or polyfocal clinical CNS event with presumed inflammatory demyelinating cause in the absence of encephalopathy and the MRI criteria for MS are not met, this is known as clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). 3 Examples of CIS include optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, hemiparesis, monoparesis, and brainstem syndromes. CIS has a higher likelihood of progression to MS as compared with ADEM. 4 The clinical symptoms and radiologic findings of ADEM can fluctuate in severity and evolve in the first 3 months after onset. Accordingly, a second event is defined as the development of new symptoms more than 3 months after the start of the incident illness. There is no strong biological rationale of the use of 3 months as a cutoff, although it is hypothesized that monophasic immune dysregulation is usually resolved within a 3-month period.",

ADEM has been reported more commonly in winter and spring. This seasonal distribution is likely due to seasonal viral illnesses and epidemics. Viruses (coronavirus, Coxsackie B, dengue, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus-6, human immunodeficiency virus, measles, mumps, rubella, and parainfluenza) are the infectious agents most frequently associated with ADEM. 9 Bacteria (Streptococcus, Mycoplasma, Legionella, Chlamydia, Borrelia, Rickettsia, Campylobacter) and parasites (Plasmodium vivax, Toxoplasma gondii) may be rarely involved. 14 The mean latency between the infectious prodrome and the onset of neurologic symptoms varies, often being between 4 and 12 days (range: 1-42 days). 9 Postimmunization ADEM accounts for only 5% of cases of ADEM. 14 Postvaccination ADEM has been associated with several vaccines such as rabies, diphtheria-tetanus-polio, smallpox, measles, mumps, rubella, Japanese B encephalitis, pertussis, influenza, hepatitis B vaccine, and human papillomavirus vaccine. In a recent retrospective review of Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database and the EudraVigilance Postauthorisation Module (EVPM) from 2005 to 2012, a total of 404 cases of postvaccination ADEM were reported, 15 and half of the patients were less than 18 years of age and with a slight male predominance. The time interval from vaccination to ADEM onset was 2-30 days in 61% of the cases. Vaccine against seasonal flu and human papillomavirus vaccine were those most frequently associated with ADEM, accounting for almost 30% of the total cases.",

Commonly headache/ vomiting (58%-32%), seizures (13%-47%), and meningismus (5%-43%) may be associated. 9 The patient may also have focal or multifocal neurologic deficits such as hemiparesis, ataxia, aphasia, diplopia, and rarely dystonia and choreiform movements. 14 Multiple cranial nerve involvement may occur. Spinal cord involvement may be present in up to 24% of cases, with clinical features of flaccid paralysis, constipation, or urinary retention. 23, 24 Myelitis is significantly more common in anti-MOG antibody-associated ADEM and is associated with longitudinally extensive lesions on the MRI. 25 The clinical course of ADEM is rapidly progressive, with the development of maximal deficits within 2-5 days. 23 Rarely, respiratory failure occurs because of brainstem involvement. Fever and seizures are described more frequently in ADEM compared with other acute demyelinating syndromes. 1 Combined central and peripheral demyelination has been reported but is very rare in children. Clinical manifestations of peripheral neuropathy may occur simultaneously along with the CNS manifestations or after them. 9",

            "text": "Other inflammatory demyelinating conditions must also be considered in the differential diagnosis. If the patient has monofocal or polyfocal symptoms in the absence of encephalopathy, then clinically isolated syndrome is diagnosed. If the predominant presentation is optic neuritis and myelitis, then neuromyelitis optica must be considered, and testing for aquaporin antibodies must be done if possible. Neuromyelitis optica with anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies is an uncommon form of CNS demyelination in children; therefore autoantibody testing for aquaporin 4 antibodies should probably be done only with optic neuritis, myelitis, and brainstem symptoms with typical AQP4 antibody-associated features. 43 The diagnosis of MS is not made during the first event but may be considered if the MRI findings are suggestive, such as the presence of old and new lesions, and fulfillment of McDonald or other criteria. 44, 45 TREATMENT The treatment of ADEM is based on observational studies and expert guidelines, because there are no randomized controlled trials. High-dose intravenous corticosteroids are generally considered the first-line treatment. The treatment regimen consists of IV methylprednisolone at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (maximally 1000 mg/d) for 3-5 days, sometimes followed by an oral taper over 4-6 weeks with a starting dose of prednisone of 1-2 mg/kg/day. 1 The risk of relapse is increased if the steroid tapering period is less than 3 weeks, although not all experts use tapered prednisolone. 24 The aim of steroid treatment is primarily to reduce the CNS inflammatory reaction and accelerate clinical recovery. Recovery rates with steroid treatment are generally good, with full recovery reported in 60%-85% of the patients. 23, 24 A repeat pulse of intravenous steroids may be considered in the case of unsatisfactory clinical improvement or early relapse. 46 IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment has been described in case reports and small case series, mostly in combination with corticosteroids or as a second-line treatment in steroid unresponsive ADEM. 47 The usual total dose is 2 g/kg, administered over 2-5 days. Treatment with IVIg has proven effective in about 40%-50% of steroid-resistant patients. 12, 48 IVIg presumably acts by binding and neutralizing autoantibodies, inhibiting cytokine release, and modulating lymphocyte activation. 14 Plasmapheresis may be considered in therapyrefractory patients with fulminant disease, with an estimated efficacy of 40%. 49 The usual regimen is five to seven exchanges but there are not infrequent complications in the form of anemia, hypotension, hypocalcemia, thrombosis, and line infections. 14 Moreover, plasmapheresis is technically difficult to perform in young children. Rarely, patients with fulminant ADEM and cerebral edema have been treated with hypothermia in which the body temperature is reduced to 34\u00b0C and intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure levels are maintained low using mannitol and dopamine. 50, 51 Decompressive craniectomy may be considered in cases of refractory intracranial hypertension. 52 ",

Neurologic improvement is usually seen within days following initiation of treatment, and recovery to baseline usually occurs within weeks. 1 Mortality has been reported in 1%-3% of affected patients in recent series. 53, 54 Residual severe disability is rare, reported in 7% of children in recent studies. 55 About 10%-40% of children are reported to experience residual cognitive impairment or changes in mood and behavior, and the neurocognitive burden of ADEM is probably underappreciated. 24, 31, 33 Few studies have analyzed the neuropsychological profile of monophasic ADEM patients. Although, overall, these patients showed a satisfactory global performance, a number of children demonstrated isolated deficits in one or more cognitive domains, most frequently the attentive and executive domains. 9 Greater vulnerability to cognitive dysfunction and behavioral problems has been noted in ADEM patients diagnosed before the age of 5 years. 56 Optic nerve involvement at presentation 23 and antecedent viral infection 24 have also been suggested as indicative of a poor outcome. In a recent study of the long-term neurocognitive outcome of children with ADEM, the most common residual symptoms were concentration difficulties (30%), behavior problems (28%), and learning difficulties (26%). 55 On the Kaufman intelligence test, a full-scale IQ of more than 85 was found in only 60% of patients, and 44% of patients fulfilled the criteria for ADHD. Male gender was a predictor for a worse neurocognitive outcome in this study. 55 The attention and behavioral impairment in ADEM may be attributed to the cerebral white matter damage that may interfere with information processing and attention skills, which are critical for emotional functioning and behavioral regulation. 56 When persisting symptoms continue after ADEM, persisting chronic immune activation should be considered, and a retrial of immune therapy can be used to determine if there is a reversible cause for ongoing symptoms.",

Latency from first episode to relapse is variable, ranging from 2 months to 8 years, 23 and even after 33 years in one case. 41 Relapses have been reported to be more common in the first 6 months after the first episode, mostly occurring in children who underwent oral steroid tapering for 3 weeks or less. 57 Most children experience a single relapse, but as many as three relapses are reported in some studies. 23, 57 An increased risk of relapse after ADEM has been associated with coexistent optic neuritis, familial history of CNS inflammatory demyelination, the presence of MS findings criteria on MRI, and the absence of sequelae after the first attack in one study. 58 Multiphasic ADEM is uncommon. In literature, multiphasic ADEM was diagnosed in only 2 of 117 (1.7%) children in one series, 59 and in 5 of 132 (3.8%) children in another series. 58 After the initial episode of ADEM, a subsequent diagnosis of MS is not common. A long-term follow-up study using the 2007 International Pediatrics Multiple Sclerosis Study Group criteria evaluated the parameters at initial diagnosis and eventual conversion to MS in a cohort of 123 children with a first episode of acute CNS demyelination. 4 Of the 47 patients initially diagnosed with ADEM, only 4 (8.5%) were eventually diagnosed with MS at follow-up versus 38.8% of those initially diagnosed with clinically isolated syndrome had MS. On multivariate analysis, the following predictors for developing MS were identified: female gender, clinical presentation with monofocal brainstem or hemispheric dysfunction, and fulfillment of the MRI criteria for MS. In a patient with first episode of ADEM, criteria for MS are met, if after the initial ADEM, a second clinical event (1) is non-encephalopathic, (2) occurs 3 or more months after the incident neurologic illness, and (3) is associated with new MRI findings consistent with revised radiologic criteria for dissemination in space. 3 Patients with anti-MOG antibodies who relapse typically have further episodes of ADEM 60 or optic neuritis, 61 and typically do not have new lesions on MRI during asymptomatic periods.",

            "text": "ADEM is a polyfocal immune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS that involves multiple areas of the white matter, which mostly affects children under 10 years of age. Common antecedents include a recent viral or bacterial infection or more rarely immunization. The diagnosis is made in the clinical setting of acute onset of encephalopathy with other neurologic deficits and MRI findings of multifocal demyelination after excluding CNS infections. Commonly, ADEM has a monophasic course in 70%-80% of cases, with most children having a good recovery with high-dose intravenous steroid pulse treatment. IVIg and plasmapheresis may be considered as second-and third-line therapies. ADEM overall has a good prognosis, but 10%-40% of children may have neurocognitive dysfunction on follow-up. Relapses may occur in 10%-30% of patients in the form of multiphasic ADEM, optic neuritis, myelitis, or MS. There is need for further evaluation of biomarkers such as anti-MOG antibodies for prediction of relapses and prognosis.",
