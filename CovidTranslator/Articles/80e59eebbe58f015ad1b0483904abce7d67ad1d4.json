            "text": "Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus has a broad global distribution. 1, 2 In 2010, ticks belonging to the genus Hyalomma infected with CCHF virus, whose lineage matched virus strains from Mauritania and Senegal, were identified in Extremadura. 3 were diagnosed in August 2016 in Spain, 4 no human cases of autochthonous acquisition had been reported in western Europe. 5 CCHF virus belongs to the family Bunyaviridae and the genus Nairovirus. Its main vectors are ticks belonging to the genus Hyalomma. 1 Different animals, both domesticated and wild, act as reservoirs for the virus (cats, sheep, goats, horses, donkeys, pigs, hares, hedgehogs, etc.). 6 Livestock is one of the most important hosts. Human beings may be infected by either a tick bite or direct handling of infected meat or fluids. 6 Nosocomial transmission has been reported by healthcare staff with accidental needle sticks or unprotected exposure to blood, bodily fluids or droplets from patients diagnosed with CCHF. 6, 7 Infection has also been reported in healthcare workers involved in the care of ill patients, without the exact route of transmission having been identified (in some articles, these cases of infection with no clear source account for up to 10-15% of nosocomial cases). [7] [8] [9] The spectrum of seriousness of CCHF is highly variable. Seroprevalence studies in endemic areas have suggested that up to 80% of cases are asymptomatic. 6, 10 The classic clinical course of CCHF has been divided into four periods: incubation, pre-haemorrhagic phase, haemorrhagic phase and convalescence. 6, 11 Reported mortality ranges from 3% to 30%, depending on the outbreak studied. Mortality is primarily caused by fulminant hepatitis, thrombocytopenia and massive bleeding. 6, 10, 12 In Turkey, since the first cases were identified in 2002, more than 9700 cases have been reported with a mortality rate of approximately 5% which has remained stable over the years. 13 CCHF virus is classified as a biosafety level 4 pathogen 14 capable of interpersonal transmission. It is advisable to manage patients with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of CCHF using strict precautions for contact under which the patient is isolated in an individual room, preferably with a separate entrance and exit. Viruses are to be isolated in biosafety level 4 high-containment laboratories, and patients with CCHF are to be managed in high-level isolation units. 14, 15 Supportive therapy is essential, since there is no effective specific aetiological treatment. Although its use is controversial as no conclusive studies have demonstrated its efficacy, in the most serious cases, it is advisable to use high-dose ribavirin. Other treatments, such as hyperimmune serum from convalescent patients, have not been shown to be useful. Furthermore, there are no vaccines with proven efficacy or safety in humans. 2",

Close interpersonal contact with the patient and manipulation of the respiratory tract are routes of transmission that are still subject to debate 16 ; however, nosocomial outbreaks of CCHF have indeed been reported during orotracheal intubation. 8 The virus's limited repercussions for domestic settings shows that invasive procedures and unprotected contact in the haemorrhagic phase cause most secondary cases.",

The room should be equipped with negative pressure systems should procedures that generate droplets need to be performed. 14, 15 Healthcare staff should be well informed about the disease and its possible mechanisms of infection. They should also be suitably educated and have regular training in putting on and taking off personal protective equipment (PPE). 6, 17 Emergency departments in endemic regions should receive instruction in upholding strict contact precautions and ensuring isolation of any suspected case from the start. 16 Some retrospective studies have found that around 50% of cases of nosocomial infection originate in patients not yet diagnosed with CCHF. 7 Although universal basic protective barriers could suffice to prevent most cases of nosocomial infection, it should be noted that hospital care is provided to more seriously ill patients with greater viraemia. Existing evidence on nosocomial outbreaks and World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations for other highly lethal haemorrhagic fevers justify the use of PPE comprising at least the following items: a waterproof gown, gloves, a mask and goggles (or a face screen). 8, 16 For clinical management of confirmed cases, it is advisable to use the same PPE used to manage Ebola virus disease: a waterproof body suit, double layers of footwear and gloves, a hood, a mask and airtight goggles. PPE must always be suited to the type of healthcare to be provided, as the risk of infection may vary. 2, 18 Therapeutic management",

            "text": "\u2022 Ribavirin: ribavirin is the antiviral drug with the most extensive experience of use in CCHF, with controversial data. It is a synthetic antiviral and a guanosine analogue. It shows a broad antiviral spectrum including DNA and RNA viruses. 19 It has been most widely used in combination with interferon for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection. 24 Although it has demonstrated antiviral activity against CCHF virus in studies in vitro and in an infant mouse model, 19 ,25,26 data on its efficacy in humans are based on observational studies, 27 a single open-label clinical trial and two meta-analyses. Ribavirin would be indicated early, in the prehaemorrhagic phase, since this is when viraemia is greatest. Once the haemorrhagic phase begins, viraemia usually decreases and pathogenic factors for coagulopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation and cytokine storm predominate. [28] [29] [30] With this pathophysiology, in order to evaluate the efficacy data for the use of ribavirin, it is critical to know the point in the course of CCHF at which drug administration was started.In 2010, Koksal et al. conducted the only randomised clinical trial, at a hospital centre in Turkey, where they compared adding versus not adding ribavirin to supportive therapy (72 versus 64 patients, respectively). They found no differences between groups in terms of either survival or length of stay. 30 Two meta-analyses performed in 2010 and 2011 also did not find the use of ribavirin to have any benefit. 28, 29 It should be noted that the studies included in each meta-analysis were non-randomised, non-blinded prospective studies, with the exception of the above-mentioned clinical trial 30 ; furthermore, they were limited in number. 28, 29 Overall, the mortality rate in patients receiving ribavirin is 2-9%; by contrast, the mortality rate in patients not receiving ribavirin is 5-11%. 31 The WHO recommends the use of ribavirin for CCHF, although the recommendation with the most support is for Lassa fever. 32 Ultimately, the evidence on the efficacy of ribavirin for the treatment of CCHF must be improved by conducting clinical trials, 33 although conducting placebo-controlled clinical trials may pose ethical problems. 34 At present, 2 non-placebocontrolled clinical trials are being conducted with intravenous ribavirin, one in CCHF and the other in Lassa fever. They are being led by the US Army Medical Research and Material Command (NCT00992693 and NCT02483260).The current consensus among experts is to use ribavirin in serious cases, preferably intravenously, to prevent the hepatic first pass effect and achieve plasma levels more quickly. Recommended doses of ribavirin vary by source consulted: regimens of 10 days, with an initial loading dose of 30 mg/kg, followed by 15 mg/kg every 6 h for 4 days and then 7.5 mg/kg every 8 h for 6 days are recommended. 6 For oral administration, the WHO recommends administering an initial loading dose of 2 g, following it with a dose of 1 g every 6 h for 4 days and finishing the regimen between the fifth and sixth day of treatment with 500 mg every 6 h. 35 Side effects, which are known from experience with treatment for HCV infectionhaemolytic anaemia, aplastic anaemia, kidney failure, hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia, and acute cholestatic hepatitis -might appear more often as a dose is administered that is four times greater. 6 Ribavirin is contraindicated in pregnant women. 6 \u2022 Favipiravir: this is a nucleoside analogue active against RNA viruses. At present, it is approved in Japan for the treatment of influenza A virus infection. 36 It is active in vitro against Bunyavirus, Arenavirus and Filovirus and has demonstrated activity against CCHF virus in mouse models. 36 In the case of CCHF virus, a study conducted in mice compared the efficacy of ribavirin, umifenovir and favipiravir. All animals treated with favipiravir in the first hour and for at least two days survived. Ribavirin prolonged the time to death but did not increase the survival rate. Umifenovir did not yield any benefit. 26 Ultimately, while favipiravir could be a treatment for CCHF, there are no data on its use in humans, nor is there any record of clinical trials in progress. 34",

Some Turkish centres even limit themselves to confirming the absence of fever for 48-72 h or the disappearance of complications particular to the disease. 42 These clinical and laboratory discharge criteria seem to be safe for the patient and for preventing community transmission of the disease according to data from a prospective multi-centre analysis conducted in Turkey. 42",

If administration is indicated, it should be started very early. 19, 27, 43 Vaccination: clinical trials have not identified any vaccine with proven efficacy. 18, 34 Clinical trials are difficult to conduct as outbreaks are sporadic with irregular numbers of cases. 25 In the early 1970s, a trial in Russia of a vaccine derived from mouse brain tissue and inactivated with formaldehyde showed a limited antibody response that increased with revaccination after a year (it demonstrated an increase in antibodies 1-4 weeks after the third dose and a decrease in antibodies 3-6 months later). 27 No further data on this vaccine were subsequently published. 25 There are two other experimental vaccines. The first is obtained from infected mouse brain cells and inactivated with chloroform. In 1974, a trial conducted in Bulgaria with fewer than 583 participants found a seroconversion rate around 96%. Another study on a population having been vaccinated every two years detected significant antibodies after receiving this biannual booster. The suggested regimen consisted of a first dose, a second dose 30-45 days later and a booster after one year followed by revaccination every five years. The Bulgarian Ministry of Health reported that the number of cases reported due to CCHF had decreased by a factor of four; however, no subsequent studies have fully supported its usefulness. 25 The second experimental vaccine is a DNA vaccine based on the M segment of the virus. This vaccine has been shown to develop neutralising antibodies in mice. 6 It was not subsequently marketed. None of the above-mentioned vaccines has been approved for use by the European Medicines Agency or the United States Food and Drug Administration.",
