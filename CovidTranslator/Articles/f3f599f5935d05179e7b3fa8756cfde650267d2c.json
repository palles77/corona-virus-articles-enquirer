A principal component analysis using these genes further confirmed the most optimal separation between the 3 different clinical phenotypes.

Even though immunosuppressive condition is the main cause for viral reactivation, not all latent infections in Kidney transplant patients lead to the development PVAN. This suggests that while the increased burden of immunosuppression appears to be crucial for viral reactivation, individual immune-susceptibility to viral infection and type of intragraft inflammation are likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of PVAN 5 .",

The diagnosis of PVAN requires histological assessment showing typical viral cytopathic changes in tubular epithelial cells and a positive immunostaining against the LT antigen of simian polyomavirus (SV40). Importantly, accompanying these lesions, there is an important tubulo-interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrate, which is indistinguishable from typical histological patterns of that observed in acute T cell mediated rejection (TCMR) 6, 7 . This is of clinical relevance since the therapeutic approaches are opposed; PVAN treatment fundamentally focuses on a progressive reduction of immunosuppression with eventual adjuvant medication, whereas TCMR requires of additional rescue immunosuppressive therapy (8) . Therefore, an accurate recognition of the PVAN-associated molecular fingerprint could help to better discriminate these 2 processes and provide new insight of the pathogenic mechanisms of the disease.",

Likewise, in the urine, increased inflammatory cytokines similar to TCMR have also been shown in PVAN patients 10, 11 . However, the evaluation using highthroughput microarray analysis of PVAN/TCMR tissue allograft samples to significantly enrich the genomic picture of these pathological features is scarce. Recently, Lubetzky et al 12 investigated the genomics of PVAN, mainly in whole blood and in a reduced number of tissue allograft samples by microarray analysis. Authors reported a significantly increased pathogenesis-based transcript activity of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells in PVAN resembling TCMR, suggesting the involvement of adaptive and innate immunity in both settings.",

All patients received an immunosuppressive regimen consisting of a combination of tacrolimus (Prograf, Astellas Pharma), mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept, Hoffman-La Roche) and daclizumab (Zenapax, Hoffman-La Roche) or thymoglobulin (Sanofi) induction. Some patients received a steroidavoidance regimen, while others received a steroid-based immunosuppressive regimen, as previously described 13 . Clinical and histological demographic characteristics were collected for all the biopsies. A subset of biopsies with PVAN, TCMR, and STA phenotypes, matched for major clinical variables such as recipient and donor age, % living donor kidneys, time posttransplant, immunosuppression usage, which was used as selected case-controls for more stringent analysis for PVAN biology ( Table 1) . Diagnosis of TCMR and IFTA was made by biopsy histology Banff classification 14 . All IF/TA samples showed Banff scores grade II or higher, without showing any other specific accompanying lesions or AR. PVAN was defined as positivity of polyomavirus PCR in peripheral blood, together with a positive SV40 stain in the concomitant renal allograft biopsy according to Banff criteria 15 . A small number of patients had BK DNA replication but no evidence of PVAN on biopsy; these patients are categorized as BKVB (BK viremia in blood only) and have been included in the global gene expression first phase analysis in Table 1 and Figure 1 . The Ethics Committee of Stanford University Medical School and UCSF Medical Center approved the study.

All biopsies were performed during the first 24 months after transplantation, either for protocol (at 6 or 24 months) or for cause because of allograft dysfunction or presence of BK DNA replication in peripheral blood. At the time of assessment, allograft function was not different between the 3 groups. Only the acute inflammatory Banff scores in the tubuli and interstitium of renal allograft compartments were significantly higher among PVAN and TCMR as compared to STA patients. The mean serum creatinine value of selected 15 TCMR patients was significantly higher (1.6 mg/dL) than the mean serum creatinine value of selected 30 STA patients (0.85 mg/dL) (p<0.001). The relatively lower serum creatinine seen in AR in this cohort is a function of this being a pediatric cohort. As per definition, only PVAN patients showed positivity for SV40 immunostaining and BK DNA replication in peripheral blood. Five patients with Bk virus presence only in the blood (BKVB) were included in the cohort of normal biopsies.",

While it is a widely accepted the fact that recognizing PVAN as early as possible is a key factor to increase the likelihood of success 5 , it still remains unclear, which is the best treatment approach to follow. In this study, using high-throughput microarrays analysis we demonstrate that the inflammatory process occurring both in PVAN and TCMR, either due to a protective anti-viral or an allogeneic immune response, respectively, merges in a remarkably similar transcriptional gene pattern, essentially associated with effector immune pathways of both the adaptive and the innate immunity.",

In this regard, Mannon et al 8 evaluated target genes by qPCR in kidney allograft biopsies from recipients with PVAN, TCMR or patients with stable allograft function and showed that despite the significantly high resemblance of gene expression between PVAN and TCMR, transcription of certain molecules associated with graft fibrosis and markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) were significantly higher in PVAN specimens, suggesting a higher profibrogenic transcriptional profile in PVAN than in TCMR patients. The higher tissue chronicity in the PVAN patient samples may also explain some of the observed differences between TCMR and PVAN relating to glucose and protein metabolism genes. Furthermore, in a recent study, Lubetzky and coworkers 12 evaluated gene expression in the whole blood as well as few kidney tissue allograft samples in PVAN and TCMR kidney transplant recipients. These studies have shown high levels of proinflammatory molecules in both settings, such as the interferon gamma-induced chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 11 , as well as other Th-2-induced cytokines such as sIL-1RA, IL-3, IL-6, and sIL-6R, being particularly high in patients with high BK DNA replication 25 .",

            "text": "Our study validated 4 PVAN-specific genes by qPCR and further confirmed using IHC. This illustrates the potential functional relevance of some of the particular transcripts uniquely expressed in PVAN biopsies as compared to rejecting patients. Firstly, Lactotransferrin (LTF), a member of the transferrin family found in mucous epithelial cells and secondary granules of polymorphonuclear neutrophils was highly differentially expressed among PVAN patients. Its expression in PVAN biopsies was significantly higher both within cellular infiltrates and in tubulo-epithelial cells as compared to biopsies with TCMR and STA. in fact, LTF has been shown to play a key role in the defense against various pathogenic microorganisms, by inhibiting different enveloped 26, 27 and naked 28, 29 virus in different virus-cell systems. In addition, in experimental animal models it has been shown that oral administration of LTF or peptides thereof is effective in reducing bacterial infections and inflammation in the urinary tract, possibly through transfer of LTF or its peptides to the site of infection via renal secretion 30 . Of note, LTF treatment has been evaluated and shown to prevent early steps of BK virus infection in vitro, most likely through the interaction with BK viral capsidic structures 31 . This finding is of relevance, since the high expression of LTF transcripts in kidney allografts infected by BK, might be the expression of a physiological protective response of the host against the virus in order to overcome the viral infection. Observation of increased expression of genes associated with TCA cycle, urea cycle, and gluconeogenesis is biologically plausible. Even though there is no report of increased metabolism in BKV infection, alteration of metabolism especially glucose metabolism and TCA cycle has been observed in case of cytomegalovirus infection 32 . It is intuitive to assume that successful replication of virus in the infected cells requires an environment that is suitable for increased supply of nutrient, energy, and macromolecular synthesis, which is reflected in the upregulated gene expression of genes related with metabolic pathways. Complment Factor D (CFD) was also upregulated in PVAN, which is a serine protease that cleaves C3b-bound factor B, resulting in the generation of Bb and formation of the alternative pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb) a key system for immune surveillance and homeostasis 33 . Increased expression of CFD and other complement genes shows activation of complement system at the time of viral infection. There is increased generation of nitric oxide (NO) due to viral infection, which is harmful 34 . NOSIP is 1 of the genes upregulated in PVAN, negatively regulates nitric oxide production by inducing translocation of NOS1 and NOS3 to actin cytoskeleton and inhibiting their enzymatic activities 35 . Furthermore, another highly up-regulated gene observed within PAVN patients as compared to TCMR and stable individuals was the IFN-inducible transmembrane 1 (IFITM-1) transcript. Interestingly, IFITM proteins are a family of ubiquitously expressed restriction factors that mediate potent IFN-induced antiviral activity by inhibiting viral entry, particularly the step of membrane fusion [36] [37] [38] . Nevertheless, while IFITM-1 antiviral activity has been well characterized against RNA viruses 37, 39, 40 , it has been shown to induce the opposite effect, that is to enhance infection of several DNA viruses. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins is likely mediated by preventing endosome fusion and viral entry into the cytosol [36] [37] [38] , as well as inhibit viral entry by preventing escape from the endocytic pathway particularly among DNA virus 41 . Therefore, over-production of IFITM-1 molecules in PVAN patients could be hypothesized to represent a signal of persistent DNA replication, illustrating the aggressive nature of BKV infection in kidney transplantation. Indeed the co-localization of IFITM-1 in close proximity to LTF in tubular cells showing BK viral inclusions further corroborate these previously reported data (Figure 4 ).",

We assessed the expression of 2 gene transcripts (LTF and IFITM-1) at the protein level. These transcripts were highly upregulated in kidney biopsies with PVAN as compared to TCMR and STA. A) Three representatives phenotypes from 3 representative transplant patient biopsies evaluated for the different protein stains. TCMR and STA are shown at 10\u00d7 and the PVAN samples are shown at 40\u00d7 magnification. Co-localization of IFITM-1 with BK viral inclusions are marked with yellow arrows in the PVAN patient. LTF also localizes in proximity to the SV40 and IFITM-1 stains in the renal tubule. (B) Semi quantitative analysis of protein expression at tubulo-epithelial cells (TEC) and mononuclear cells of patients with PVAN, TCMR and STA.",
