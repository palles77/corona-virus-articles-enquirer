RCs provide an advantageous microenvironment for viral replication, but it is unknown how the host immune system counteracts these structures. Here we show that interferon-gamma (IFNG) disrupts the RC of murine norovirus (MNV) via evolutionarily conserved autophagy proteins and the induction of IFN-inducible GTPases, which are known to destroy the membrane of vacuoles containing bacteria, protists, or fungi. The MNV RC was marked by the microtubule-associatedprotein-1-light-chain-3 (LC3) conjugation system of autophagy and then targeted by immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) and guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) upon their induction by IFNG. Further, the LC3 conjugation system and the IFN-inducible GTPases were necessary to inhibit MNV replication in mice and human cells. These data suggest that viral RCs can be marked and antagonized by a universal immune defense mechanism targeting diverse pathogens replicating in cytosolic membrane structures.",

Intriguingly, this antiviral activity of IFNG against the MNV RC depends on a protein complex involved in autophagy . Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular pathway that delivers cytoplasmic material to lysosomes for degradation (Levine et al., 2011) . Among the multiple types of autophagy, macroautophagy (henceforth, autophagy) is the major process that sequesters and transports cytosolic material inside double-membraned autophagosomes (Noda and Inagaki, 2015) . For efficient formation of autophagosomes and selective capture of cargo, ubiquitinlike microtubule-associated-protein-1-light-chain-3 (LC3) and its homologs must be conjugated to the membrane-embedded lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Similar to the conjugation of ubiquitin to a target amino acid residue, an E1-like activating enzyme, ATG7, and an E2-like conjugating enzyme, ATG3, function together with an E3-like ligase, the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex, to conjugate LC3 to PE (Noda and Inagaki, 2015) . We found that IFNG requires this E3-like ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 ligase complex, but not lysosomal degradation through autophagy, to inhibit MNV RC formation and viral replication . However, it remains unknown how IFNG utilizes this E3-like ligase complex to inhibit the MNV RC.",

IRGs and GBPs are dynamin-like GTPases that are targeted to the membrane of cytoplasmic vacuoles containing bacteria, protists, or fungi (Ferreira-da-Silva et al., 2014; Pilla-Moffett et al., 2016) . The targeted membranes are vesiculated, which leads to eventual rupture of the vacuoles and ultimately the death of exposed pathogens (Hunter and Sibley, 2012) . Unexpectedly, Atg5 was required for targeting the IRGs and GBPs to the PVM of T. gondii (Selleck et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2008) . We further found that only the LC3 conjugation system of autophagy, but not lysosomal degradation, is required to target these immune effectors to the PVM of T. gondii . Consequently, control of T. gondii infections by IFNG in vitro and in vivo depends on the LC3 conjugation system Haldar et al., 2014; Ohshima et al., 2014) . Furthermore, we found that the LC3 conjugation system is necessary and sufficient to target the IFN-inducible GTPases to membranes; upon relocation of the LC3 conjugation system to the plasma membrane or the mitochondria outer membrane, IRGs and GBPs were redirected to these endomembranes (Park et al., 2016) .",

These data suggest that IFNG inhibits the replication of +RNA viruses via LC3-dependent targeting of IFN-inducible GTPases to the RC.

To genetically define the role of the canonical autophagy pathway in this antiviral activity of IFNG, we examined Ulk (uncoordinated 51like kinase) and Atg14. ULK1 and ULK2 are serine/threonineprotein kinases of the autophagy initiation complex that induces autophagy upon various signals (Chan et al., 2007) . ATG14 is an essential component of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex that nucleates the formation of isolation membrane (Diao et al., 2015) . In primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from Ulk1 \u00c0/\u00c0 , Ulk2 \u00c0/\u00c0 , or littermate control mice, there was no significant difference in viral replication or inhibition by IFNG ( Figure 1A ). To rule out the possibility of pheno-type masking due to the redundancy of Ulk1 and Ulk2, we also tested mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Ulk1 \u00c0/\u00c0 Ulk2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (McAlpine et al., 2013) . To overcome the barrier of entry, the limiting step in infection (Orchard et al., 2016) , transfection of MNV viral RNA (vRNA) is frequently used to analyze MNV replication in non-infectable cell types . Upon transfection of MNV vRNA into Ulk1 \u00c0/\u00c0 Ulk2 \u00c0/\u00c0 and control MEFs, infectious MNVs were produced and inhibited by IFNG comparably in both cell lines ( Figures 1B and 1C) . Similarly, MNV replication in control (Atg14 flox/flox ) and Atg14-deficient (Atg14 flox/flox +LysMcre) BMDMs was comparable and similarly inhibited by IFNG ( Figures 1D and 1E ). These data affirmed our previous findings that the antiviral activity of IFNG requires a specific function of the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex rather than the canonical autophagy pathway .",

LC3 conjugation also requires the proteolytic processing of LC3 by ATG4; we had previously ruled out a role of ATG4B, the major isoform of ATG4, in the IFNG-mediated control of MNV replication . This suggested an LC3 conjugation-independent function of the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex, but the existence of other ATG4 isoforms undermined such a conclusion. In order to definitively examine the necessity of LC3 conjugation, we investigated the role of E2-like ATG3 in the IFNG-mediated inhibition of MNV replication. MNV replication was considerably less inhibited by IFNG in the Atg3-deficient (Atg3 flox/flox +LysMcre) BMDMs compared to the control (Atg3 flox/flox ) ( Figure 1F ). Since LC3 was still substantially conjugated to PE due to suboptimal deletion of Atg3 ( Figure 1G ), we further examined Atg3-deficient MEFs (Atg3 \u00c0/\u00c0 ) . We confirmed functional knockout (KO) of ATG3 and consequent obstruction of autophagy in Atg3 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs, as manifested by lack of conversion of cytosolic LC3-I to membrane-bound LC3-II and accumulation of autophagy adaptor/cargo p62 ( Figure 1H ). MNV replication was not significantly controlled by IFNG in these Atg3 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs ( Figure 1I ), but lentiviral expression of ATG3 back into the Atg3 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs restored the control of MNV replication by IFNG ( Figures 1H and 1I ). Collectively, these data show that the IFNG-mediated inhibition of MNV replication requires the E2like ATG3 as well as the E1-like ATG7 and the E3-like ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex .",

In fact, we recently found that LC3 homologs fulfill redundant functions in the IFNG-mediated control of T. gondii; only with the KO or knockdown of all LC3 homologs is the IFNG-mediated control of T. gondii lost (Park et al., 2016) . Thus, to test the role of all LC3 homologs, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knock out all remaining LC3 homologs, except one allele of Gabarap, in Lc3b \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs (Hwang et al., 2012) (Figures S1A and S1B).

In fact, LC3 localized on the MNV RC without IFNG activation ( Figure S2A ) in an Atg5-dependent manner ( Figure S2B ), and the localization of LC3 to the MNV RC requires the conjugation capability of LC3 ( Figure S2C ), just as it localizes on the PVM of T. gondii Park et al., 2016) . Thus, we further examined the potential targeting of IFN-inducible GTPases, IRGs and GBPs to the MNV RC. Because we cannot detect MNV RCs in cells pre-activated with IFNG (Hwang et al., 2012), we delayed IFNG treatment to allow MNV to form detectable RCs before being counteracted by IFNG. At 10-12 hr of MNV infection and simultaneous IFNG treatment, we detected formation of MNV RCs as well as expression of IFN-inducible GTPases (Figures 2 and  S2D ). Under these experimental conditions, both LC3 and IRGA6 (a representative effector of the IRG protein family) localized to a portion of the RCs (Figures 2A and 2B); we reasoned that such co-localization might be limited and transient due to inhibition of the RC by the recruited IFN-inducible GTPases. In a similar experimental condition, we also confirmed the localization of LC3 and IRGA6 to the RC of another +RNA virus, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) ( Figures S2E and S2F ).",

Importantly, both LC3 and IRGA6 localization to the MNV RC were dependent on the functional LC3 conjugation system, as their localizations were substantially reduced upon Atg5 deletion (Figures 2A and  2B ). In contrast, the deletion of Atg14, which does not disturb LC3 conjugation , did not affect their localizations to the MNV RC ( Figures 2C and 2D ). These data demonstrated that both LC3 and the IFN-inducible GTPases were indeed recruited to the MNV RC, dependent on the functional LC3 conjugation system but independent of the canonical autophagy pathway.",

To identify specific GBPs associated with the MNV RC, we expressed individual epitope-tagged GBPs (GBP1, 2, 3, 5, and 7; deleted in Gbp chr3\u00c0/\u00c0 mouse as described below) in both WT and Gbp chr3\u00c0/\u00c0 BMDMs via lentiviral transduction. Only GBP1 and GBP2 significantly localized to the MNV RC upon IFNG activation in WT BMDMs ( Figures 2E and 2F ), but GBP2 was the only one that localized to the MNV RC in the absence of the other GBPs ( Figures S3C and S3D) . Interestingly, even GBP2 did not localize to the RC in the absence of IFNG activation ( Figure S3E ), suggesting that correct targeting requires an IFN-inducible co-factor(s) (e.g., a functional IRG system as described below). Like the effector IRGs, the localization of GBP2 to the MNV RC was dependent on Atg5, but not on Atg14 ( Figures S4A-S4E) . The IFN-inducible GTPases are known to be targeted only to vacuoles containing bacteria, protists, or fungi (Ferreira-da-Silva et al., 2014; Pilla-Moffett et al., 2016) . The data shown here establish the membranous RCs of + RNA viruses, MNV and EMCV, as a destination of these IFNinducible GTPases.",

To ensure a high infection rate for efficient EM analysis, we utilized the BV-2 cell line . We first confirmed that a representative IRG (i.e., IRGA6) and GBPs (using a pan-GBP antibody detecting GBP1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) localized to the MNV RC upon the simultaneous MNV infection and IFNG treatment in BV-2 cells ( Figure S4F ). Under the same experimental condition, EM analysis revealed abundant vesicular structures around the nucleus only in MNV-infected cells ( Figure 3A ). We further found anti-ProPol (detecting both protease and polymerase of MNV) staining in these vesiculated areas ( Figure 3B ). Most anti-ProPol staining was associated with membranes and was significantly detectable only in infected cells ( Figure 3B ), suggesting that the vesicular structures are the MNV RC. Anti-LC3 staining was also detected around these anti-ProPol-positive structures in both untreated and IFNG-treated conditions ( Figure 3B ). Although simultaneous activation of the cells with IFNG did not significantly affect these structures, we detected both anti-IRGA6 and anti-GBP1-5 staining on the vesicle membranes around anti-ProPol-positive structures in IFNG-treated cells ( Figures  3C and 3D ). While we could not definitively conclude the 3D topology of the proteins through these images, the majority of LC3, IRGA6, and GBP1-5 localized on the inner side of these vacuole-like structures together with ProPol, which is topologically the cytoplasmic side of the RC. These data suggest that LC3 and the IFN-inducible GTPases are recruited onto the cytoplasmic face of the MNV RC membrane and may exert their antiviral effect directly onto the membrane structure of the MNV RC.",

            "text": "To investigate the role of the IFN-inducible GTPases in the IFNGmediated control of MNV, we obtained Irgm1 \u00c0/\u00c0 Irgm3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (missing regulatory IRGs, Irgm1 and Irgm3; a non-functional IRG system) and Gbp chromosome 3 deletion (Gbp chr3\u00c0/\u00c0 , with the deletion of Gbp1, 2, 3, 5, and 7; a non-functional GBP system) mice (Figures S5A  and S5B ). MNV RC formation is inhibited in WT BMDMs pre-activated with IFNG, but not in Atg5-deficient BMDMs ( Figure 4A ). Similarly, MNV RC formation was not inhibited by IFNG in BMDMs lacking either a functional IRG or GBP system ( Figures 4A and S5C) . These data suggest that both IRGs and GBPs are required for IFNG to inhibit the MNV RC. We further investigated the control of MNV replication by IFNG in BMDMs from Irgm1 +/+ Irgm3 +/+ (WT), Irgm1 +/\u00c0 Irgm3 +/\u00c0 (HET), and Irgm1 \u00c0/\u00c0 Irgm3 \u00c0/\u00c0 (KO) mice. In Irgm1 and Irgm3 WT and HET BMDMs, MNV replication was completely inhibited upon pre-activation of the cells with IFNG ( Figure 4B ). In KO BMDMs, however, MNV replication was not substantially controlled by IFNG. To confirm the specificity of the phenotype, we restored individual and dual expression of IRGM1 and IRGM3 in the KO BMDMs via lentiviral transduction and could restore the IFNGmediated control of MNV replication in Irgm1 \u00c0/\u00c0 Irgm3 \u00c0/\u00c0 BMDMs expressing IRGM3 at a functional level ( Figures 4C  and 4D ). We further confirmed that MNV replication is controlled normally by IFNG in Irgm1 \u00c0/\u00c0 BMDMs ( Figure S5D ). In BMDMs with Gbp chr3 deletion, MNV replication was substantially less inhibited by IFNG pre-treatment, compared to BMDMs with Gbp chr3 WT and HET ( Figure 4E ). When we restored the expression of GBP1 and GBP2 in Gbp chr3\u00c0/\u00c0 BMDMs, only GBP2 was able to restore the IFNG-mediated control of MNV replication back to the level of WT BMDMs (Figures 4F and 4G) . We further confirmed that MNV replication was substantially less inhibited by IFNG in Gbp2 \u00c0/\u00c0 BMDMs ( Figure S6D ). Although GBP2 did not localize onto the MNV RC in Irgm1 \u00c0/\u00c0 Irgm3 \u00c0/\u00c0 BMDMs, IRGA6 localized onto the MNV RC in Gbp chr3\u00c0/\u00c0 BMDMs (Figures S6A-S6C) . These data corroborate a sequential recruitment model of the IFN-inducible GTPases onto their target membranes, i.e., IRGs prior to GBPs (Haldar et al., 2015) , and further suggest a two-stage inhibitory mechanism of the GTPases against the MNV RC: the IRGs alone and in collaboration with the GBP system. Taken together, these data suggest that the IFN-inducible GTPases not only localize on the MNV RC but also play an antiviral role against MNV replication in vitro.",

Therefore, after breeding the Irgm1 \u00c0/\u00c0 Irgm3 \u00c0/\u00c0 and Gbp chr3\u00c0/\u00c0 mice to type I IFN receptor-deficient mice (Ifnar \u00c0/\u00c0 ), we examined the survival of MNV-infected mice and MNV replication in various organs as previously reported . The control mice were significantly susceptible to MNV infection, implying a key role of type I IFN signaling in controlling the in vivo infection of MNV (Figures 5A and 5C) . Nevertheless, consistent with the in vitro BMDM data, the KO mice of IFNinducible GTPases (Ifnar \u00c0/\u00c0 Irgm1 \u00c0/\u00c0 Irgm3 \u00c0/\u00c0 and Ifnar \u00c0/\u00c0 Gbp chr3\u00c0/\u00c0 ) were more susceptible to MNV infection than their littermate control mice ( Figures 5A and 5C) ; there was also substantially more viral replication in infected organs from KO mice than in organs from control mice (Figures 5B and 5D ). Collectively, these data corroborate the importance of both type I IFN and type II IFN signaling in controlling MNV infection in vivo and further demonstrate that both IRG and GBP systems play crucial roles in the IFNG-mediated control of MNV replication in vivo as well as in vitro.",

In contrast, the IRG protein family is smaller in humans, with only two proteins, IRGM and IRGC, identified (Bekpen et al., 2009) . Previous work has shown that the LC3 conjugation system and the GBPs counteract pathogens in humans, although the functional mechanisms vary considerably (Al-Zeer et al., Johnston et al., 2016; Ohshima et al., 2014; Selleck et al., 2015) . To examine the role of the LC3 conjugation system in controlling norovirus replication in human cells, we obtained HeLa cells with Atg7 or Atg16l1 knocked out by the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Selleck et al., 2015) . Consistent with our results in mouse macrophages, both LC3 and GBPs localized on the RC of MNV that resulted from the expression of MNV nonstructural proteins ) ( Figure 6A ); the HeLa cell clones without functional Atg7 or Atg16l1 ( Figure 6B ) had substantially decreased localizations of LC3 and GBPs on the RCs ( Figure 6C ). In contrast, we did not detect any sign of IRGM localization on the MNV RC ( Figure S6F ). Using the vRNA transfection system, we further confirmed that the LC3 conjugation system was required for IFNG to inhibit MNV replication in HeLa cells ( Figure 6D ). Comparably, in human HAP1 cells with Atg16l1 \u00c0/\u00c0 or Gbp 1-7\u00c0/\u00c0 (complete human GBP KO) (Ohshima et al., 2014), MNV replication was substantially less inhibited by IFNG than in the control cells ( Figures 6E and 6F) . Taken together, these data demonstrated that both the LC3 conjugation system and GBP system were required for IFNG to inhibit MNV replication in both humans and mice.",

We previously discovered an antiviral activity of IFNG functioning against the RC of MNV, which requires a nondegradative function of the E3-like ligase ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex . However, its functional mechanism and pertinent effector proteins were unknown . Using the T. gondii model, we found that the E3-like ligase complex can determine the target membrane of the IRGs and GBPs Park et al., 2016) . Based on these similar genetic requirements, here we identify the IFN-inducible GTPases, IRGs and GBPs, as the immune effectors functioning against the RC of MNV.

This can result from the viruses hijacking the autophagy machinery or simply using LC3 for their own benefit (Reggiori et al., 2010; Sharma et al., 2014) . In fact, it was recently shown that MNV infection induces autophagy, leading to the localization of LC3 on the RC and facilitation of viral replication (O'Donnell et al., 2016) . Regardless of LC3's potential proviral roles, LC3 could simultaneously play an antiviral function by recruiting the IFN-inducible GTPases to RCs, as shown in this study. While IFNG requires Atg5 to inhibit MNV replication, it can also act in the absence of Atg5 to inhibit the replication of other +RNA viruses, such as EMCV, murine hepatitis virus, and West Nile virus . This suggests that IFNG has an additional antiviral function independent of Atg5, and thus independent of the LC3 conjugation system and the IFN-inducible GTPases, to inhibit the replication of these viruses. Therefore, the crucial antiviral role of the IFN-inducible GTPases against the RC of other +RNA viruses may only be revealed in the absence of this ''Atg5-independent'' antiviral activity of IFNG.",

Human GBPs have been reported to play antiviral roles against dengue virus, EMCV, vesicular stomatitis virus, and influenza virus, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown (Anderson et al., 1999; Nordmann et al., 2012; Pan et al., 2012) .

The consequent exposure of the resident pathogens to the host cytoplasm leads to inhibition of the pathogen replication, activation of cytosolic pathogen sensors, and/or subsequent death of the pathogens and/or the host cells (Pilla-Moffett et al., 2016) . Similarly, IRGs and GBPs may disrupt the structural integrity of the MNV RC and trigger additional antiviral responses by the host. However, translating the previously proposed membranolytic mechanism of the GTPases to the MNV RC has a major caveat: the size of the MNV RC. The MNV RC is roughly the same size as vesicles ($50-300 nm in diameter) created from the PVM of T. gondii ($5 mm in length) during the process of IRG-and GBP-mediated vacuole disruption (Wobus et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2008) . Thus, the dimensions of the MNV RC may be too small to be vesiculated by the IFN-inducible GTPases. If the IRGs and GBPs behave similarly on the membranes of the MNV RC as they do on the PVM of T. gondii, they may deform the structure and subsequently inhibit the function of the MNV RC, for example, inhib-iting viral genome replication and transcription, rather than demolishing the structure. It is also possible that the GTPases may even block the formation of the MNV RC as well as disrupt the formed RCs. How the IRGs and GBPs exert their antiviral function against the MNV RC will be a subject of future mechanistic investigation.",

            "text": "It has been proposed that IRG targeting of vacuolar pathogens is limited to a select but disparate group, i.e., the protist T. gondii, the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, and the fungus Encephalitozoon cuniculi (Ferreira-da-Silva et al., 2014; Springer et al., 2013; Tiwari et al., 2009) . It is suggested that the cytosolic face of these plasma membrane-derived vacuoles containing these target organisms may be distinct from host endomembranebound intracellular compartments because the organisms enter host cells via non-endocytic/phagocytic mechanisms (Ferreirada-Silva et al., 2014) . Since MNV enters cells through a host endocytic process (Perry and Wobus, 2010) and its RC is known to be composed of membranes derived from the ER, Golgi, and endosome (Hyde et al., 2009) , our study does not support this hypothesis. Independent of the mechanism of entry, the membrane structures may share common patterns allowing the IRG system to be activated and targeted. The control of MNV by IFNG is dependent on Atg5 because the putative Atg5-independent Figure 6 .

Dashed line indicates the limit of detection. See also Figure S6 . antiviral activity of IFNG cannot control MNV . Likewise, the control of the disparate group of pathogens by IFNG might be dependent on the IRG system also because this is the only effective immune mechanism against these intracellular parasites. Further work is necessary to determine if there are any common pathogen-associated molecular patterns among this group of pathogens controlled by IRGs and how the IRG system is activated on these vacuole structures .",

This provides a unifying working model in which the same effector mechanism is used against diverse intracellular pathogens that replicate inside cytosolic membrane structures. Importantly, this system is conserved in humans with a smaller set of the IFN-inducible GTPases. Further studies will determine how the cell-autonomous immune system utilizes the LC3 conjugation system to detect and destroy the membranous shelters of pathogens.",

At 10 hpi, the cells were fixed, processed, and examined as previously described (Selleck et al., 2015) . For ultrastructural analyses, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (Polysciences, 00380)/2.5% glutaraldehyde (Polysciences, 18426) in 100 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, C0250), pH 7.2 for 1 hr at room temperature. Samples were washed in sodium cacodylate buffer and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Polysciences, 0972A) for 1 hr. Samples were then rinsed extensively in dH 2 0 prior to en bloc staining with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate (Ted Pella, 19481) for 1 hr. Following several rinses in dH 2 0, samples were dehydrated in a graded series 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 95% ethanol for 20 min each. Samples were further dehydrated in three changes of 100% ethanol for 20 min each followed by two changes in propylene oxide (Ted Pella, 18601) for 30 min each. Samples were then infiltrated with 1:1 propylene oxide:Eponate 12 resin (Ted Pella, 18012) for 30 min followed by 1:3 propylene oxide:Eponate 12 resin overnight at room temperature. Samples were infiltrated with freshly made Eponate 12 resin for eight hours, and then polymerized in the resin at 70 C overnight. Sections of 95 nm were cut with a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems), stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 30 min and 3% lead citrate (Ted Pella, 19314) for 5 min, and viewed on a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA) equipped with an AMT 8 megapixel digital camera and AMT Image Capture Engine V602 software (Advanced Microscopy Techniques). For immunolocalization, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/0.05% glutaraldehyde in 100 mM piperazine-N,N[prime]-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES)(Sigma-Aldrich, P6757)/0.5 mM MgCl 2 (Sigma-Aldrich, M8266), pH 7.2 for 1 hr at 4 C. Samples were then embedded in 10% gelatin and infiltrated overnight with 2.3 M sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, S9378)/20% polyvinyl pyrrolidone (Sigma, PVP10) in PIPES/MgCl 2 at 4 C. Samples were trimmed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and sectioned with a cryo-ultramicrotome. Sections of 50 nm were blocked with 5% FBS and 5% normal goat serum for 30 min and subsequently incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 1 hr, followed by secondary antibodies: donkey antiguinea pig conjugated to 12 nm colloidal gold (Jackson ImmunoResearch, , donkey anti-mouse conjugated to 18 nm colloidal gold (Jackson ImmunoResearch, and goat anti-rabbit conjugated to 18 nm colloidal gold (Jackson ImmunoResearch, for 1 hr. Sections were washed in PIPES buffer followed by a water rinse, and stained with 0.3% uranyl acetate/2% methyl cellulose (Sigma, M6385) and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy.
