In this study, we introduced the airflow vortex structure to analyze how airflow patterns affected contaminant transport in an aircraft cabin. Experimental data regarding airflow patterns were used to validate a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Using the validated CFD model, we investigated the effects of the airflow vortex structure on contaminant transmission based on quantitative analysis. It was found that the contaminant source located in a vorticity-dominated region was more likely to be ''locked\" in the vortex, resulting in higher 62% higher average concentration and 14% longer residual time than that when the source was on a deformation dominated location. The contaminant concentrations also differed between the front and rear parts of the cabin because of different airflow structures. Contaminant released close to the heated manikin face was likely to be transported backward according to its distribution mean position. Based on these results, the air flow patterns inside aircraft cabins can potentially be improved to better control the spread of airborne contaminant.",

            "text": "As an increasing number of people are traveling by air, the exposure risk of infectious diseases in aircraft cabins has become an important public health issue [1] . Most modern aircrafts have high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA-type) filter in their ventilation recirculation systems, which can remove more than 99.9% of the pathogen particles produced by the passengers [2] . However, these pathogen particles can spread in the cabin air before being removed by the HEPA filters. The worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [3] and tuberculosis (TB) [1] further indicates that the transmission of infectious diseases through airflow inside aircrafts is a key factor for passenger exposure risk. The present standards [4, 5] in commercial aircrafts provide ventilation and contaminant requirements based on the comfort of passengers. For example, ASHRAE [4] recommends a minimum air supply of 9.4 L/s per person and required the in-flight ozone concentration shall not exceed 0.25 ppm at any time. However, they do not consider the effects of airflow patterns on airborne contaminant transport. Therefore, it is important to study how aircraft cabin air flow patterns affect the transmission of airborne contaminants in the aircraft cabin to optimize the ventilation system and control the spread of infectious diseases.",

These previous studies contribute to our understanding of airborne contaminant transmission inside aircraft cabins. They found contaminants released at points farther from the cabin exhausts had a wider spread than those released close to the exhausts, lateral dispersion in the middle injection case was more rapid than that in the side injection case due to the center mixing zone, and droplets were more likely to travel backward because of the thermal plume from infected passengers. However, they primarily focused on qualitative analysis of the bulk airflow patterns and did not consider the impact of fine airflow structures on the transmission of airborne contaminants. Recently, Li et al. [7] studied the effect of different contaminant sources and found that in the narrow cabin space, a small different (10 cm) in the source locations can result in a significant difference in contaminant fields. This indicated the fine and complex airflow structure was an important factor in determining airborne contaminant distributions.",

Provenzale [9] reviewed the transmission properties of coherent vortices in rotating barotropic flows and reported that ''passive tracers can be trapped inside vortex cores for long times and are transported by the vortex motion over large distances\".

In addition, the enhanced wall treatment [20] [21] [22] was adopted for this study because the calculated y plus value was less than five. The Boussinesq approximation was employed to consider the buoyancy effect which has been a common approach for indoor airflow simulations. For the steady velocity field simulation, this study applied the SIMPLE algorithm to couple pressure and velocity. The standard and first-order upwind scheme was used for pressure discretization and all other variables. The residual was below 10 \u00c06 for energy and 10 \u00c03 for all other variables. A commercial software Fluent was used as the numerical solver to fulfill the models. Fig. 1 shows the overall digital geometry model. The modeled shapes of the cabin and manikins were built to the exact same dimensions as their actual physical shapes for the simulation. According to a previous study [23] , we measured the velocity boundary of the diffusers by combination of hot-sphere anemometers (HSA) and ultrasonic anemometers (UA). The thermal boundary of the walls and manikins was measured by an infrared camera. The velocity and temperature boundary conditions were assigned into the numerical solver through user-defined functions (UDFs). The pressure outlet boundary condition was applied on the exhausts, and the reference pressure value was set to 0 Pa. The details of the tested velocity and temperature boundary conditions can be found in Li et al. [24] .",

When Q > 0, deformation dominates; when Q < 0, vorticity dominates. However, in a practical application, the interval of Q is always divided into three parts by q 0 (q 0 = 0.2 dQ , where dQ is the standard deviation of Q in the entire fluid domain). When Q > q 0 , the domain is dominated by deformation; when Q < \u00c0q 0 , the domain is dominated by vorticity; and when \u00c0q 0 < Q < q 0 , the domain is an ambient field. According to a previous study [27] , these standards can identify the airflow vortex structure for complex fluids. In this study, this standard was adopted, and the airflow vortex structures calculated through the experimental data were used to validate the CFD model as well. Fig. 2 compares the experimental airflow patterns with corresponding simulated data. Because of the blocks of seats and manikins, only the airflow in the upper and middle domains of this section was obtained through PIV measurement. It is shown that the decay of simulated velocity seems slower than the experiment. Lin et al. [28] stated that the RANS simulation underpredicted the turbulence energy, while a large eddy simulation (LES) can obtain more realistic turbulent energy. The LES simulation needs much more meshes than nine million, and it is beyond the current computer capability. However, the simulated results agree with the experiments in the sense that the CFD model captured the trend of airflow patterns. The jets from the right and left diffusers are merged in the middle, and the jets from left sides are both little stronger. The velocity magnitudes are lower in the top and side regions. Fig. 3 presents the comparison of the experimental and simulated vortex structures. The red regions in the figure are dominated by deformation, blue regions are dominated by vorticity, and the green regions are ambient fields. The simulated results seem smoother, while the experiment has more discrete points. However, the CFD model captures the two big vorticities on the sides and the domain dominated by deformation in the middle.",

In contrast to source 2, the contaminants from source 1 and 3 can be transported to its respective upside, and the concentration above the seats is much higher (Fig. 5(a, d) ). Using a path line as an indicator, the trajectory of the contaminant can be indicated more clearly. In this section, 20 massless particles [16] were released on each location, and their trajectories were got. The path lines from source 2 almost escaped from the cabin, and fewer path lines went back to the upsides (Fig. 5(c) ). However, more path lines from source 1 and 3 were recirculated back to the upsides, which resulted in higher concentrations above the seats (Fig. 5(a,d) ).

CTR is an index showing the contaminant transmission radius and is defined as follows: where x G is the central position of the contaminant field. The residual time of the air is the time that the contaminants released from the source spend in the cabin before being exhausted, and it can be calculated from a reversed airflow filed [33] . These indexes can be calculated in the CFD solver by UDFs. Table 3 presents DAC, CTR and RTA for different sources. Corresponding to Fig. 5 , the dimensionless average concentrations for source 1 and 3 dominated by vorticity are 62% higher than that for source 2. The residual times of the air at source 1 and 3 location are 14% longer, because the air ''locked\" by vorticity needs more time to escape from the cabin. However, the contaminant transmission radiuses for different sources are not observable. This maybe because most of the contaminants can be exhausted in the same row, and the transmission radius is dependent on the cross section size to a great extent.",

Ten massless particles were released on each side respectively to get their path lines. Note that path lines are three dimensional and the two dimensional figure can only show their projections.

The details of these parameters can be found in Gupta et al. [36] . Through this calculation, the distance that a breathing jet could travel in our study is approximately 40 cm. Therefore, we can assume that, if a person breathes through the nose (the contaminants were released close to the face), the airborne contaminants are more likely to be transported backward. However, if a person breathes through the mouth, the breathing jet can go through line MN (Fig. 7) , and therefore, the airborne contaminants are more likely to be transported forward. Bianco et al. [37] analyzed the transient airflow behavior in the cabin. They reported observable velocity fluctuations, probably due to the flow field instability, which was caused by the vortex movements. This means the vortex structures is actually transient in the cabin. However, the current PIV experiment [12] can only capture the time-averaged airflow field. Therefore, the RANs model is appropriate in this study. With the experimental technology developing, some transient numerical models such as URANS and LES model can be used to investigate transient airflow and vortex movements.",

We employed an Okubo-Weiss parameter Q from fluid mechanics to identify the vortex structures. By setting the contaminant sources at locations with different vortex structures in the simulation and experiment in the 7-row cabin, we found that the fine airflow vortex structure has an important effect on airborne contaminant distributions.",

However, these locations should have similar relative distances to diffusers and exhausts. In the longitudinal section, different airflow vortex structures also resulted in different concentrations between the front and rear parts. The airflows close to the heated manikin's chest and face was more likely to move contaminants backward, while the airflows distanced to it was more likely to deliver contaminants forward. However, the trend for unheated manikins was uncertainty, because of low longitudinal velocity and Q value.",

The vortex structure analysis also can not only be applied in cabin environments, but also in another enclosed environments such as rail cabins and submarines. Further research on applications of more advanced numerical models and three-dimensional vortex structure analysis are needed. ",
