Although several vaccines against these viruses are commercially available there is room for improvement, especially in the case of PRRSV. The ability of arteriviruses to counteract the immune response is thought to decrease the efficacy of the current modified live virus vaccines. We have recently shown that the deubiquitinase (DUB) activity of EAV papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) is important for the inhibition of innate immune activation during infection. A vaccine virus lacking PLP2 DUB activity may therefore be more immunogenic and provide improved protection against subsequent challenge than its DUB-competent counterpart. To test this hypothesis, twenty Shetland mares were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Two groups were vaccinated, either with DUB-positive (n = 9) or DUB-negative (n = 9) recombinant EAV. The third group (n = 2) was not vaccinated. All horses were subsequently challenged with the virulent KY84 strain of EAV. Both vaccine viruses proved to be replication competent in vivo. In addition, the DUB-negative virus provided a similar degree of protection against clinical disease as its DUB-positive parental counterpart. Owing to the already high level of protection provided by the parental virus, a possible improvement due to inactivation of PLP2 DUB activity could not be detected under these experimental conditions. Taken together, the data obtained in this study warrant further in vivo investigations into the potential of using DUB-mutant viruses for the improvement of arterivirus vaccines.",

The aim of the current study was to determine in vivo whether this DUB-negative virus provides better protection against subsequent challenge infection than its parental DUBcompetent counterpart.

In order to assess whether a PLP2 DUB-negative vaccine virus provides better protection than its DUB-competent counterpart against challenge with a virulent EAV strain, we performed a vaccination-challenge trial in horses. The data obtained in this study showed that in contrast to what was previously seen in cell[ 6 _ T D $ D I F F ] culture experiments (van Kasteren et al., 2013) , the PLP2 mutant virus appears to replicate slightly less efficiently than its parental virus in vivo (Fig. 3A) . Even though the DUB-negative virus is clearly replication competent, this finding does suggest a role for PLP2 DUB activity in supporting replication in vivo, e.g. by inhibiting the innate immune response. In addition, despite this slight decrease in replication efficiency, the levels of protection against clinical disease (Table 2) , the antibody response (Fig. 2B) , and the innate immune response (assessed based on the expression of two interferon-stimulated genes; Fig. 3B and C) induced by the PLP2 DUB-negative virus was comparable to that induced by the parental virus. Surprisingly, we did not observe an increase in EAV-neutralizing antibody titres upon challenge infection of vaccinated animals (Fig. 2B) . A possible explanation for this finding is that the virus dose used for challenge was too low, resulting in its efficient clearance before (re-)activation of the antibody response. Taken together, the present study could not be used to substantiate (or refute) our hypothesis that a DUB-negative virus provides better protection against challenge than its DUB-positive counterpart. The main reason for this seems to be the fact that the parental virus already provides a very high degree of protection, which as it turned out could not be detectably improved using this experimental set-up. In hindsight, one solution might have been to perform a more severe challenge, for example by using a higher virus dose for inoculation or a more heterologous and/or virulent strain than KY84. As PRRSV vaccines are in general less efficacious than EAV vaccines, another option would be to perform a similar trial with a PRRSV vaccine in pigs, but this will first require the design of viable PRRSV PLP2 DUBnegative mutants.",

However, it needs to be noted that we have thus far assessed the expression of only two interferon-stimulated genes, whereas many more exist. It therefore remains a possibility that differences do exist in the expression of other interferon-stimulated genes. Similarly, the induction of interferon-stimulated genes is only one of several consequences of the activation of innate immune signalling. It therefore remains possible that the DUB-negative vaccine virus differs from the parental virus in some other respect pertaining to immunity, for example the activation of cell-mediated adaptive immunity. Also, PLP2 DUB activity likely constitutes only one of several innate immune evasion strategies employed by arteriviruses. For example, nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) of EAV was recently shown to inhibit the induction of interferon beta in a luciferase reporter assay (Go et al., 2014) and the PRRSV nsp4 main protease was recently shown to cleave the innate immune signalling factor NEMO (Huang et al., 2014) . Also [ ( F i g . _ 3 ) T D $ F I G ] Fig. 3 . Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of viral RNA and cellular mRNA encoding ISG15 and MX1. (A) Viral replication from 0 to 10 dpv (Groups 1 and 2) or 0 to 10 dpc (Group 3) was assessed by real-time qRT-PCR analysis on total RNA isolated from whole blood using EAV-specific primers. White, black, and grey circles represent animals from Group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Horizontal bars represent the mean for all animals on that day and the dotted line represents the limit of detection. Activation of the innate immune response was assessed by real-time qRT-PCR on total RNA isolated from whole blood using primers specific for B) ISG15-or (C) MX1-encoding mRNA. Values obtained for ISG15 and MX1 mRNA levels were normalized to the amount of b-actin mRNA. The dotted lines represent average baseline levels, error bars represent standard deviations, and asterisks indicate statistical significance (Student's t-test; p < 0.05). Abbreviations: AU, arbitrary units; DUB+, deubiquitinase-competent vaccine virus; DUB\u00c0, deubiquitinase-negative vaccine virus. nsp1a Han et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2010; Song et al., 2010) , nsp1b (Beura et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2010; Patel et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013a) , and the nucleocapsid protein (Sagong and Lee, 2011) have been proposed to counteract innate immune activation. Taken together, the PLP2 DUB activity appears to constitute only a part of the total repertoire of arterivirus innate immune evasion strategies. For this reason, its contribution to the inhibition of innate immunity perhaps cannot be readily detected in the in vivo experimental set-up used here. For example, detecting more prominent consequences of its inactivation may depend on the details of the animal study, including specific properties of viruses and horses used. Nevertheless, the apparently limited negative effect on viral replication of PLP2 DUB-mutations does open up possibilities for combining mutations in multiple domains involved in immune evasion, thereby potentially synergistically increasing the overall immunogenicity of the virus.",

For example, coronaviruses (including SARS-and MERS-CoV) encode papain-like proteases that display DUB activity (for a review, see Mielech et al., 2014) . The OTU proteases of nairoviruses have also been found to possess DUB activity (Frias-Staheli et al., 2007) . Like arterivirus PLP2, these viral DUBs have been implicated in innate immune evasion (Frias-Staheli et al., 2007; Mielech et al., 2014) and are therefore potential targets for the design of novel vaccines. Interestingly, we have recently been able to show that the DUB and polyprotein processing functions of the papain-like protease encoded by MERS-CoV can also be separated by targeted mutagenesis (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014) . Taken together, the data obtained in this study definitely warrant further in vivo examination of the consequences of knocking out arterivirus PLP2 DUB activity as well as other immune-evasive activities to improve vaccine efficacy. The data obtained in such studies could subsequently also be used as preliminary proof of principle for the design of novel vaccines for other viruses, including corona-and nairoviruses.",
