            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first detected in Hong Kong and has recently spread to many countries around the world. PDCoV causes acute diarrhea and vomiting in pigs, resulting in significant economic losses in the global pork industry. In this study, a Chinese PDCoV strain, designated CHN-HG-2017, was isolated from feces of a suckling piglet with severe watery diarrhea on a farm located in central China. Subsequently, the virus was identified by an indirect immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopy. A nucleotide sequence alignment showed that the whole genome of CHN-HG-2017 is 97.6%-99.1% identical to other PDCoV strains. Analysis of potential recombination sites showed that CHN-HG-2017 is a possible recombinant originating from the strains CH/SXD1/2015 and Vietnam/HaNoi6/2015. Furthermore, the pathogenicity of this recombinant PDCoV strain was investigated in 5-day-old piglets by oral inoculation. The challenged piglets developed typical symptoms, such as vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea and lethargy, from 1 to 7 days post-inoculation (DPI). Viral shedding was detected in rectal swabs until 14 DPI in the challenged piglets. Interestingly, high titers of virus-neutralizing antibodies in sera were detected at 21 DPI. Tissues of small intestines from CHN-HG-2017-infected piglets at 4 DPI displayed significant macroscopic and microscopic lesions with clear viral antigen expression. Our analysis of the full genome sequence of a recombinant PDCoV and its virulence in suckling piglets might provide new insights into the pathogenesis of PDCoV and facilitate further investigation of this newly emerged pathogen.",

The genome of PDCoV is 25.4 kb in length, making it the smallest genome among the known coronaviruses (CoVs) [2] . The coding region of PDCoV is flanked by short 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs), and the gene order is 5\u2032-UTR-ORF1a-ORF1b-S-E-M-NS6-N-NS7-3\u2032-UTR. PDCoV encodes at least four structural proteins, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, as well as two accessory proteins, NS6 and NS7 [3] [4] [5] [6] . The S protein is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion and acts as the major antigen inducing neutralizing antibodies [7] . The N protein is highly conserved and plays a critical role in viral RNA encapsidation [8] . The M and E proteins are important for virion assembly and budding [9] .",

Following the first detection of PDCoV in pigs with diarrhea in Ohio, USA, in [4, 5, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Piglets infected with PDCoV are characterized by watery diarrhea, variable vomiting, and dehydration [3] . Notably, PDCoV-positive piglets are frequently co-infected with other enteric viruses, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), rotavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), which considerably increases the morbidity and mortality of piglets [17] . PDCoV outbreaks have been reported in many countries worldwide and have caused significant economic losses in the pork industry. Moreover, due to the unique genome replication strategy of coronavirus, PDCoV undergoes RNA mutation and recombination events at high frequency, giving rise to new variants, which makes it extremely difficult to control and eliminate [18] . In 2015, Saif and coworkers reported that a PDCoV strain named OH-FD22 caused severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by severe diarrhea and vomiting in gnotobiotic piglets [19] . Macroscopic examination revealed that the jejunum and ileum are the major targets for PDCoV infection, and the pathological lesions were similar to, but milder than, those caused by PEDV [19] . Subsequently, the pathogenicity of several American strains, including USA/IL/2014, Michigan/8977, and Ohio CVM I, was investigated in piglets [20] . These American strains exhibited pathogenic characteristics similar to those of OH-FD22. In addition, it has been reported that newborn piglets inoculated with two recent Chinese PDCoV isolates, named CHN-HN-2014 and CHN-GD-2016, developed clear clinical signs, including severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration [21, 22] .",

Twelve 5-day-old piglets were purchased from a commercial pig farm and were randomly divided into two groups, which were housed in separated containments. Prior to PDCoV inoculation, piglets were confirmed to be negative for PDCoV, PEDV, TGEV, and rotavirus by testing rectal swabs by RT-PCR.

Clinical symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, and appetite loss, were observed and recorded daily. Rectal swabs were collected daily from each piglet from the first day postinoculation (DPI) to the end of the experiment. Swabs were submerged into 1 ml of PBS immediately after collection.

These results showed that the small intestine is the major target of CHN-HG-2017 infection. Microscopic lesions in the small intestine were also observed by microscopy. Compared to those of the negative control piglets, the intestinal villi of the PDCoV-infected piglets were blunted and fragmented and exhibited atrophy and vacuolation, especially in the jejunum and ileum (Fig. 7C and D and Table 5 ). Moreover, aggregation of lymphocytes and hyperemia in the intestinal lamina propria were also observed ( Fig. 7C  and D) , but the intestines of the negative control were normal ( Fig. 7E and F) . Consistent with the histopathological results, PDCoV antigen was detected by immunohistochemical staining in the cytoplasm of the infected villous enterocytes ( Fig. 7G and H) .

Notably, only one PDCoV strain was isolated from a total of 17 PDCoV-positive feces samples, indicating that the success rate for virus isolation was still relatively low. This low rate of PDCoV isolation might be attributed to a small amount of infectious virus in the fecal samples collected for virus isolation. In addition, the time at which the sample is collected might also contribute to the success of PDCoV isolation.",

Moreover, we identified predicted TRSs at the 5\u2032 end of each gene of CHN-HG-2017, each with a highly conserved core sequence of 5\u2032-ACCAC-3\u2032, which appears to be unique to members of the genus Deltacoronavirus. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that all of the known PDCoV strains share a high level of nucleotide sequence identities. However, CHN-HG-2017 was most closely related to other Chinese PDCoV strains. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that PDCoV strains from China, the United States and South Korea are clustered in the same clade, whereas the PDCoV strains from Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam are clustered in another clade.",

Intriguingly, CHN-HG-2017 was found to be a possible recombinant virus derived from parental strains from China and Vietnam. The major parent and minor parent were identified as strain SXD1 from China and strain HaNoi6 from Vietnam, respectively. The potential breakpoints in CHN-HG-2017 were located at nt 3153 and 4249 in the nsp3 region. Deletion mutations in the nsp3 region in PDCoV have been reported recently [6, 26] , suggesting that nsp3 which encodes a papain-like protease, may be a hotspot for genetic modification. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a recombination event has been identified in the Nsp3 region of PDCoV. The emergence of recombinant strains from China and Vietnam will probably bring new challenges to the prevention and control of PDCoV.",
