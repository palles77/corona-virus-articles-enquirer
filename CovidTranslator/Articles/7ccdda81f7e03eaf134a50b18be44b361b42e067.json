            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS has been recognized as a global threat since the initial outbreak of SARS first identified in Guangdong Province, China in November 2002. This outbreak spread to several countries and has had significant health and economic impact. SARS is a lifethreatening form of atypical pneumonia characterized by high fever, malaise rigor, headache, chills, cough, and progressive radiographic changes of the chest and lymphophenia. [1] [2] [3] The mortality rate is nearly 10%. 4 The SARS-CoV is a positive-strand RNA virus that uses a complex set of enzymes to replicate the largest RNA genomes currently known for RNA viruses and synthesize an extensive set of 5 0 leader-containing subgenomic mRNAs that encode the viral structural proteins and several species-specific proteins with unknown functions. These processes are mediated primarily by the 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) with chymotrypsin fold. The active site of SARS-CoV 3CL pro contains Cys145 and His41 to constitute a catalytic dyad, in which cysteine functions as the common nucleophile in the proteolytic process. 5, 6 Because of the essential role in viral processing, the 3CL pro is considered as an attractive target for anti-SARS and other coronavirus infections. 3CL pro is named after the 3C proteases (3C pro ) from picornaviruses such as enterovirus (EV), coxsackievirus (CV), and rhinovirus (RV) which cause life-threatening infectious diseases. The 3C pro essential for viral replication had served as a drug target. 7 Both 3C pro and 3CL pro have similar 3-D structures, but unlike the dimeric 3CL pro , 3C pro is monomeric and utilizes Glu-His-Cys triad for catalysis. 8 To date various SARS-CoV protease inhibitors have been reported from both screened compound libraries and designed compounds based on the substrate structure or active site properties. Their scaffolds are diverse, including C 2 -symmetric diols, 9 3-quinolinecarboxylic acid derivatives, 10 thiophene-2-carboxylate derivatives, 11 cinanserin, 12 calmodulin, 13 keto-glutamine analogs, 14 anilide, 15 bifunctional boronic acid compounds, 16 isatin derivatives, 17 pyrmidinone, 18 benzotriazole 19 as well as glutamic acid and glutamine peptides possessing a trifluoromethyl ketone group, 20 a,b-unsaturated esters, 21 and etacrynic acid derivatives. 22 With metal-coordinated structures, some molecules make a covalent bond with Cys-145 at the active site of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . 23 However, no effective therapy has been developed so far and recent isolation of strains of SARS-CoV emphasizes the possibility of a reemergence. Therefore, it is still a great challenge to explore new chemical classes of SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors that can be used in anti-SARS therapy in case the disease re-emerges.",

According to the modeling shown in Figure 2B , the R 1 nitro group of 2u forms H-bond with Gly-145 (2p and 2t without nitro group fail to form such a H-bond) and benzylidene carboxylate of 2u is H-bonded to Glu-71 in the active site of 3C pro . It was predicted that the C-3 phenyl ring of 2u is pointed to S1 site and the carboxyl benzylidene group is relocated to S2 in order to form the H-bond in 3C pro due to the subtle differences between the structures of 3CL pro and 3C pro . 7 However, it should be noted that computer modeling is speculation based on energy minimization to fit the SAR data. In conclusion, 2p and 2t are selective against 3CL pro , but 2u is a common inhibitor of 3CL pro and 3C pro , which may be potentially developed into anti-coronaviral and anti-picornaviral drugs.",
