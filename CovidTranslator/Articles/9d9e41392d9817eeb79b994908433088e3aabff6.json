Its RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity appears to be supplied by non-structural protein 12 (nsp12) that includes an RdRp domain conserved in all RNA viruses. Using SARS coronavirus, we now show that coronaviruses uniquely encode a second RdRp residing in nsp8. This protein strongly prefers the internal 5 0 -(G/U)CC-3 0 trinucleotides on RNA templates to initiate the synthesis of complementary oligonucleotides of o6 residues in a reaction whose fidelity is relatively low. Distant structural homology between the C-terminal domain of nsp8 and the catalytic palm subdomain of RdRps of RNA viruses suggests a common origin of the two coronavirus RdRps, which however may have evolved different sets of catalytic residues. A parallel between the nsp8 RdRp and cellular DNA-dependent RNA primases is drawn to propose that the nsp8 RdRp produces primers utilized by the primerdependent nsp12 RdRp.",

This family includes the Coronavirus and Torovirus genera that together with the distantly related Arteriviridae and Roniviridae families form the Nidovirales order (Gonzalez et al, 2003; Draker et al, 2006 and reviewed in Lai and Holmes, 2001; Siddell et al, 2005) . The coronavirus genome RNA is translated to express the two most 5 0 open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, occupying approximately two-thirds of the genome. They encode major subunits of a poorly characterized membrane-bound complex that mediates the synthesis of the genome RNA (replication) and numerous subgenomic RNAs (transcription) (Gorbalenya, 2001; Thiel et al, 2001; Gosert et al, 2002; Prentice et al, 2004; Ziebuhr, 2005) . ORF1a encodes the replicative polyprotein (pp) 1a, and ORFs 1a and 1b together encode pp1ab. Expression of the ORF1b requires a -1 ribosomal frameshift just upstream of the ORF1a stop codon. The two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are autocatalytically processed by at least two proteases to produce up to 16 end products called non-structural proteins (nsp) 1 to 16, as well as multiple processing intermediates . The central and C-proximal regions of the polyproteins are processed at 11 conserved sites by the chymotrypsin-like proteinase known also as main proteinase (Mpro) that resides in nsp5 (reviewed in Ziebuhr et al, 2000) .",

Replicase polyproteins of nidoviruses share a conserved array of functional domains (from the N-to C-termini): Mpro, RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Cheng et al, 2005) , zincbinding domain-containing helicase (ZBD-HEL) (Ivanov et al, 2004b) and uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) (Bhardwaj et al, 2004; Ivanov et al, 2004a) . In coronaviruses, RdRp, ZBD-HEL and NendoU reside in nsp12, nsp13 and nsp15, respectively. In large nidoviruses, such as corona-, toro-and roniviruses, the conserved replicase polyprotein backbone is elaborated with additional enzymatic domains, including an exoribonuclease (ExoN) Minskaia et al, 2006 ) and a putative ribose-2 0 -O-methyltransferase (Feder et al, 2003; Snijder et al, 2003) , which in coronaviruses, reside in nsp14 and nsp16, respectively. Despite recent progress in the characterization of replicase proteins, a large fraction of these proteins encoded in ORF1a (nsp1, nsp2, some nsp3 domains, nsp4, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8 and nsp10) remains functionally poorly characterized.",

It revealed a hexadecamer in which eight nsp7 molecules act as a mortar that holds the nsp8 octamer. RNA binding experiments with these subunits and the overall architecture of the complex suggest that the later encircles RNA. These authors have proposed that this complex provides a platform that might confer processivity to the synthesis of large RNAs in coronavirus nsp12 RdRp-mediated replication and transcription. This RdRp is phylogenetically clustered with RdRps of ( \u00fe ) RNA viruses whose genome RNAs have the 5 0 -end covalently linked to a viral protein genome-linked (VPg) (Koonin, 1991) . For the well-studied poliovirus RdRp, covalent (oligo)nucleotide-VPg complex serves as a primer to direct the templatedependent synthesis of RNAs by RdRp (Paul et al, 1998) . RdRps of the VPg-containing viruses share a conserved sequence motif G that was implicated in the recognition of primer-template RNA complex (Barrette-Ng et al, 2002; Gorbalenya et al, 2002; Thompson and Peersen, 2004) . The motif G was also identified in RdRps of coronaviruses , and accordingly, the SARS-CoV RdRp was shown to be primer-dependent (Cheng et al, 2005) . Since the 5 0 -end of genome RNA of coronaviruses is blocked by a cap rather than a VPg (Siddell et al, 2005) , these data indicate that coronaviruses may have evolved a special mechanism to generate primers used in RNA synthesis.",

In cellular organisms, template-derived RNA primers direct the DNA synthesis at both leading and lagging strands. A specialized, low-fidelity DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, known as primase, catalyzes the synthesis of short (4-15 nucleotides) RNA molecules to be used as primers by replicative DNA polymerases; these primers are subsequently removed by ribonucleases (Frick and Richardson, 2001) .

However in the profile searches, we observed an under-thethreshold hit with an equivalently located region in the ORF1a-encoded polyprotein of the Breda bovine torovirus (BToV-1) (Draker et al, 2006) . In the torovirus pp1a/pp1ab polyproteins, this region is flanked by two potential 3CL cleavage sites, which may be recognized by Mpro (Figure 1 and AE Gorbalenya, personal communication) . These data indicate that the identified region may be a very distant ortholog of nsp8.

A strong activity using poly(rC) and oligo(rC 15 ) template ( Figure 2 ) was detected, with a linear polymerase activity after up to 4 h of incubation, in a template-dependent manner. The activity was found to be manganese-dependent, although magnesium but not Zn 2 \u00fe , Co 2 \u00fe nor Ca 2 \u00fe could also promote RdRp activity with a much lower efficiency (Supplementary Figure 1B) . Nsp8 preparations are insensitive to rifampicin, a potent Escherichia coli RNA polymerase inhibitor. Nsp8 polymerase activity is free of contaminating or intrinsic terminal transferase (TNTase) activity. Indeed, a TNTase activity assay carried out with 5 0 -labeled oligo(rC 15 ) and unlabeled guanine triphosphates as substrates shows no ladder-like products above the labeled oligo(rC 15 ) template (data not shown). The RdRp activity was blocked by mutations at the most conserved positions of nsp8 (see below). Thus, the RdRp activity is catalyzed by nsp8 rather than a co-purified protein.",

Elongation of the labeled primers by nsp8 was not detected (not shown). An ability of the nsp8 RdRp to synthesize RNA in the primer-independent mode was compared to well-established primer-independent RdRps, the HCV NS5B and the Dengue virus (DV) NS5 (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001; Kao et al, 2001) . In this assay, an oligonucleotide of 15 consecutive cytidines (oligo(rC 15 ) and GTP) were used as the template and the sole nucleotide substrate, respectively, to direct RNA synthesis. Figure 2 shows the synthesis of oligo(rG) products for each polymerase. The size pattern of products synthesized by nsp8 is similar to those that were produced using HCV NS5B and, to a lesser extent, DV NS5. In the reactions catalyzed by either nsp8 or HCV NS5B, a similar pattern of products up to 7-mers was found. The most prominent was the accumulation of pppGpG, which is a hallmark of a kinetic limitation in the initiation step of RNA synthesis. However and in contrast to NS5B and NS5, nsp8 was unable to catalyze the synthesis of the full-length complementary copies of the template. The seemingly full-length products are shorter and accumulated to a lesser extent than those produced by HCV NS5B or DV NS5. These results indicate that nsp8 is an RNA-directed, primer-independent RdRp acting in a distributive fashion.",

A significant nsp8 RdRp activity was only detected using poly(rC) template. Since poly(rG) template generates strong secondary structures, it cannot be tested in a similar polymerase assay. To analyze whether guanines could be part of a template for nsp8, the heteropolymeric RNA template, 5 0 -UAU AAU GGA AAA-3 0 (oligo 5), containing two internal guanines, was tested. No nsp8 RdRp activity was detected using this template. Based on these and other experiments (see below), we concluded that the template must contain at least one cytosine to promote RNA synthesis by nsp8. A 373-nt heteropolymeric RNA template identical to a part of the SARS-CoV genome was used to monitor RdRp activity, and the results are presented in Figure 3A . Nsp8 is able to synthesize only short RNA products (o6-mers), whereas HCV NS5B RdRp is able to synthesize both short and long products. The nsp8 heterogeneous product profile suggests various internal initiation sites (see below). Various short synthetic RNA oligonucleotides were then designed to refine relevant template requirements for an efficient synthesis of RNA products by nsp8 (Table I) .",

This alignment and individual nsp8 sequences were used to search sequence databases as described in Snijder et al (2003) . Using results of these searches, the original alignment was extended to a distantly related (see text) torovirus sequence using the MUSCLE program. The resulting alignment was converted into this figure using the ESPript program, version 2.2 (http:// espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/cgi-bin/ESPript.cgi). Residues that are conserved in all or 470% sequences are boxed in red and yellow, respectively. Above the alignment, numbering and secondary structure elements (Zhai et al, 2005) GCC, GCA, UCU and GCU in order to promote activity, with the optimal sequence being 5 0 -(G/U)CCNN-3 0 ( Figure 3B , and not shown). Synthesis starts on the 5 0 C leaving one cryptic 3 0 C. Figure 3B (left lanes) shows nsp8dependent band products formation, using oligo 10 template (5 0 -UAUAGUCCCAAA-3 0 ). Products accumulate over time, for each incorporation, confirming that nsp8 acts in a rather distributive fashion. Taken together, these results demonstrate that nsp8 is a sequence-specific RdRp. As GTP is the required initiating ( \u00fe 1) nucleotide, we used the oligo 10 template (Table I) to measure K m (GTP) at position \u00fe 1. An overall incorporation efficiency V max /K m of 0.65 \u00c210 \u00c05 min \u00c01 mM \u00c01 was measured for GTP, with K m (GTP) of 126714 mM, a value comparable to that of other viral RdRps (Ranjith-Kumar et al, 2002; Castro et al, 2005; Selisko et al, 2006) . This latter value is significantly lower than the intracellular GTP concentration (1-4 mM) (Hauschka, 1973) , suggesting that the cellular GTP concentration is not rate-limiting for the nsp8-mediated RNA synthesis initiation reaction. The ATP and CTP incorporation efficiencies at the \u00fe 2 position were on the same order of magnitude, 1.7 \u00c210 \u00c05 min \u00c01 mM \u00c01 and 0.65 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 min \u00c01 mM \u00c01 , respectively.",

In contrast, when ATP, UTP or CTP are omitted, a full size product is not detected, indicating that in the absence of the required NTP, nsp8 does not significantly misincorporate a nucleotide ( Figure 3B ). Based on the observed rate of misincorporation, we could estimate a lower limit of 1 misincorporation per 10 nucleotides synthesized for nsp8 RdRp (data not shown, also see Figure 3 and Discussion). When ATP is omitted, a shift is observed from the usual dinucleotide product pppGA towards pppGG, indicating that nsp8 rather favors a shift in its initiating site over a misincorporation at the original site ( Figure 3B ).

In total, 14 mutants of nsp8 were generated ( Figure 5 ), expressed in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity using affinity and exclusion chromatographies. The RdRp specific activity of these mutants was measured using [ 3\u00c0 H]GTP incorporation into RNA using a poly(rC) template, and was expressed as a percentage of the activity of the wild-type nsp8 ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 3 ). The K58A, R75A, K82A and S85A mutations abolished or greatly reduced the RdRp activity. The nsp8 RdRp activity was most sensitive to replacement of either of the three residues, K58, K82 and S85, which are also conserved in the torovirus sequence. The D161A mutant remains substantially active. Although the nsp8 activity is metal-ion dependent, there are no essential and conserved acidic residues that may chelate a catalytic All oligonucleotides are RNA except oligonucleotide 11, which is a single-stranded DNA template.

Nsp8 and nsp7 form a hexadecameric toron structure able to encircle and bind RNA as judged by both the presence of a strong positive charge in the inner channel and biochemical assays. Nsp7 is thought to play the role of a mortar, bringing cohesive force to the complex with no obvious role in RNA binding (Zhai et al, 2005) . All conserved nsp8 residues, which are essential for the RdRp activity, are located on the second large alpha helix ( Figure 1 ) with residues Lys-58 and Arg-75 surrounding, but slightly outside the channel. These residues were implicated in RNA binding. The essential residues map to a dimeric nsp8, which is part of two equivalent dimers in the hexadecameric nsp8/nsp7 complex. Interestingly, the comparison of the folding of the head domain of nsp8 (corresponding to the most C-terminal 99 aa residues) shows similarity to a family of the RNA-binding domains (RBD) (Supplementary Figure 4) (Krissinel and Henrick, 2004) . This family is characterized by the two ssRNA recognition motifs Rnp1 and Rnp2 (Maris et al, 2005) . These motifs are composed of mainly hydrophobic and positively charged residues. Both the RBD and the head of nsp8 are folded into an a/b sandwich. The structure of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (hnRNP D), belonging to the RBD family, was solved in complex with ssRNA by NMR (Enokizono et al, 2005) . Identical connectivity and sequential arrangement of secondary structural elements are also conserved in the RdRp palm subdomain (containing catalytic Asp residues in the GDD motif) (Hansen et al, 1997) (Supplementary Figure 5) , providing evolutionary hints about a possible nsp8 origin (see Discussion).",

In this superimposition, the ssRNA is stacked by the hydrophobic surface of the two RNP motifs and points towards the inner part of the hexadecamer channel ( Figure 6B ). Thus, while an nsp8 molecule of the hexadecamer stacks the RNA template ( Figure 6A , represented in black), a second is able to bind the nascent primer. Then, the two first NTPs incorporated (GTP in \u00fe 1 and CTP in \u00fe 2) are bound to two strictly conserved basic residues Arg-75 and Lys-82 present on the second nsp8 molecule ( Figure 6A , represented in clear gray). The positioning of the GTP primer against the helix implies that triphosphated dimers and longer primers would not fit into the active site, consistent with the fact that they are not elongated.",

These RdRps are distinguished by the presence of the G sequence motif that was implicated in the primer/template recognition . Relevance of these observations for coronaviruses may be linked to the finding that the SARS-CoV nsp12 RdRp is active, in vitro, using a poly(rA)/ oligo(dT) 12\u00c018 primer-template (Cheng et al, 2005) . Since coronaviruses may not produce VPg, the identity of a primer One micromolar of nsp8 wt and 1 mM of Ala mutants were tested for polymerase activity by measuring [ 3 H]GTP incorporation using a poly(rC) template. Nsp8 polymerase specific activity is represented as follows: empty lozenge (B); 100% activity relative to nsp8 wt; black lozenge (E), between 12 and 40% activity and; asterisk ( * ), less than 4% activity (see Supplementary Figure 3 for precise values). and the mechanism of its generation have remained unresolved for these viruses. Besides VPg, cellular RNA molecules are recruited by some RNA viruses to prime polynucleotide synthesis in either replication or transcription of the genome. This strategy was adopted by influenza viruses and retroviruses, which either hijack a piece of a cellular mRNA (Plotch et al, 1981) or use a tRNA (Mak and Kleiman, 1997) , respectively, as a primer. We propose that coronaviruses have evolved another strategy to produce primers, which may use the newly identified nsp8 RdRp as the primase.",

In comparison to other template-dependent DNA and RNA polymerases, fidelity is of a less importance for DNA-dependent primases.

This excision could be part of the methyl directedmismatch repair activity that is worth further testing. Similarly to the E. coli and eukaryotic primases, the nsp8 RdRp exhibits a limited processivity. The prokaryotic DNA primases (i.e., from the E. coli DnaG family) generally recognize specific sequences on the template (Yoda et al, 1988) , while eukaryotic primases are sequence-independent (Bullock et al, 1994) . The SARS-CoV nsp8 revealed marked sequence preferences and, like cellular primases, RNA synthesis starts with a purine residue. Once the nsp8/RNA/nucleotides ternary complex has been formed, a rate-limiting step occurs before or during dinucleotide synthesis, a feature that is also common for cellular primases. In our hands, nsp8 and the purified nsp7-nsp8 complex exhibit comparable activities (not shown). The only noticeable biochemical difference between nsp8 and the nsp8-nsp7 complex, which may be the functional form of the nsp8 RdRp, is a relatively poor thermal stability of nsp8 (data not shown). Remarkably, this property was predicted upon examination of the crystal structure of the nsp8-nsp7 complex by Zhai et al (2005) , who described nsp7 as a 'mortar' protein.",

Our preliminary results show that in agreement with the reported results and the proposed model, purified nsp8 and nsp12 interact in GST-pull down experiments (Imbert et al, unpublished data). The 3-to 5-fold excess of the nsp8 synthesis relative to nsp12, due to downregulation of the latter by frameshifting (Brierley, 1995; Thiel et al, 2003) , seems to be used to build the nsp7/nsp8 octamer complex containing four nsp8 subunits (Zhai et al, 2005) . Consequently, equimolar stoichometric ratio between interacting nsp8 and nsp12 species may be maintained in the infected cell. The nsp8 has a unique bi-domain structure that is different from those of prokaryotic and eukaryotic primases. Its C-terminal domain has a fold also found both in a diverse family of RNA-binding proteins and the catalytic palm-subdomain of RdRps (Hansen et al, 1997 ; see Supplementary Figure 5 ). This finding indicates that the nsp8 RdRp and nsp12 RdRp may have originated from a common ancestor, possibly through a duplication during evolution leading to the emergence of the ancestral virus of the Coronaviridae family. Previously, duplications of PLpro and Mpro were implicated in the evolution of the coronavirus proteome (Ziebuhr et al, 2001) . The eight most conserved residues are distributed between the two domains of nsp8. Three polar and essential residues, Lys-58, Lys-82 and Ser-85, which may be part of the catalytic residues network for the phosphoryl transfer reaction, are located in the N-terminal domain. As in the case of the coronavirus Mn 2 \u00fe -dependent endonuclease nsp15, the metal-ion dependence in catalysis remains undefined and is unlikely to be promoted by acidic residues. However, our tertiary structure modeling analysis further suggests that the highly conserved Trp-182 in the C-terminal domain (head domain) is close to the a-phosphate of the \u00fe 2 nucleotide and might be involved in Mn 2 \u00fe coordination promoting metalbased nucleophilic activation at the phosphorus center. Indeed, such interaction between aromatic residues and cation, termed cation-p (Dougherty, 1996) , have been described as a non-covalent bonding interaction relevant for molecular recognition and catalysis (Zaric et al, 2000) . A role for Trp-182 in catalysis is consistent with the fact that in the putative torovirus ortholog, the residue is also an aromatic residue (Tyr). Regardless of the precise composition of the catalytic center of nsp8, it differs from that conserved in the nsp12 RdRp, impeding to determine undoubtedly if these two RdRps have been acquired independently or have diverged profoundly.",

The ORF of the final construct (referred to as nsp8) encoded an N-terminally 6 His-tag. This construct was mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, according to the manufacturer's instruction (Stratagene). All constructions were verified by DNA sequencing (Millegen, France). Proteins expression and purification were performed as described (Campanacci et al, 2003) . Proteins were homogenous as judged by SDS-PAGE (see Supplementary Figure 1A ). They were concentrated to 5 mg/ml and stored in 50% glycerol at \u00c0201C. Recombinant proteins were characterized by dynamic light scattering and circular dichroism spectra, which were undistinguishable from wt nsp8. Enzyme concentrations were determined using UV l280 absorbance. No attempts were made to determine the proportion of active enzyme (enzyme active site concentration).",

All indicated concentrations are final. The reaction was performed in an optimized polymerase buffer made of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM MnCl 2 , 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100 containing 10 mM of [a-32 P]GTP. The templates were either 10 mM RNA oligonucleotide, 1 mM poly(rC). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 mM purified nsp8 and incubated at 301C. Aliquots were withdrawn over time from 10 s to 2 h and the reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA/Formamide. Reaction products were separated using sequencing gel electrophoresis (14% acrylamide, 7 M urea in TTE buffer (89 mM Tris, 28 mM taurine, 0.5 mM EDTA)) and quantitated using photo-stimulated plates and a FujiImager (Fuji). In some instances, nsp8 activity was quantitated using a filter paper binding assay. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 mM nsp8 in polymerase buffer containing 1 mM poly(rC) template, 0.1 mM [ 3 H]GTP (0.5 mCi), in the same buffer as above, incubated at 301C, and stopped by spotting aliquots onto DE-81 paper discs (Whatman International Ltd). Filter paper discs were washed three times for 10 min in 0.3 M ammonium formate, pH 8.0, washed two times in ethanol, and dried. The radioactivity bound to the filter was determined using liquid scintillation counting. Under these conditions, the nsp8 specific activity was consistently in the vicinity of 62 c.p.m. min \u00c01 .",

The superimposition between the head of nsp8 and a member of the RBD, the C-terminal of CstF-64 (PDB code: 1p1t) (Perez Canadillas and Varani, 2003) shows a global RMSD of 2.8 \u00c5 . However, the RMSD calculated only for the two motifs is about 1 \u00c5 for RNP2 and 1.9 \u00c5 for RNP1 (Supplementary Figure 4) . We also performed a structural alignment with different RNP members to check the correlation between the existence of the RNP motifs and the position in the structure. This alignment was carried out using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) . Then, the alignment was analyzed and optimized with SeaView (Galtier et al, 1996) , taking into account the secondary structure from the high-resolution models.",

Based on the structural alignment ( Supplementary Figure 4) , we have generated a superimposition between hnRNP D with its ssRNA (PDB: 1wtb) (Enokizono et al, 2005) and the head of one nsp8 monomer. Then, the position of the ssRNA was manually adjusted using Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) to avoid steric clash and to correct the direction of the ssRNA backbone to point out towards the central cavity of the hexadecamer. Another minimization cycle was performed taking into account the presence of the RNA template (as described above). To model the initiation state of nsp8, we docked the first two nucleotides base pair complementary (GTP in \u00fe 1 and CTP in \u00fe 2) to the ssRNA template. These two nucleotides are the first two to be incorporated in the nascent RNA chain. These two nucleotides of the new strand were manually docked on the top of the head respecting Watson and Crick base pairing dictated by the template. A last round of energy minimization was performed on this quaternary structure (primase/template/incorporated nucleotides).",
