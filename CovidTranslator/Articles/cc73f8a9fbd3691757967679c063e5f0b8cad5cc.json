            "text": "In this research, objective physical measurements and subjective questionnaire surveys are used to investigate the indoor environment quality of Chinese inpatient buildings. The relative humidity in the inpatient buildings reaches 65%-75% during summer, resulting in the regular appearance of microbial growth on indoor surfaces. The average outdoor air change rate measured through the CO 2 concentration decay method in the sampled inpatient rooms is 1.1 h \u22121 , which is 45% below the standard threshold. The CO 2 concentration in over 99% of the functional spaces is below the threshold of 1000 ppm. However, the dissatisfaction rate of the air freshness is higher than 25%, owing to the characteristics of healthcare activities. Insufficient fresh air volume and high supply air humidity ratio of the outdoor air system result in the inadequate dehumidification capacity and the over-humid environment in the inpatient buildings. From the perspective of indoor TVOC and PM2.5 concentration, a hospitable IAQ is achieved in the inpatient buildings. In the nurse unit, the illumination levels in public areas, such as patient corridors and nurse stations, are inadequate. The average noise levels (A) in the inpatient rooms and nurse stations are 50.7 and 61.6 dB, respectively, which exceeds the Chinese standard. According to the subjective survey, the dissatisfaction rates of overall IEQ in the summer for patients and visitors are 7.9% and 10.4%, respectively, while for staff it is 34.8%. Statistical analysis reveals that the satisfaction levels of the patient with the IEQ are higher than that of the visitor and staff.",

            "text": "The number of hospitals in China was 31,056 in late 2017, including 1751 large hospitals with over 800 sickbeds. The rate of aging of China's population reached 17.3% in late 2017 and this accelerate aging of the population has created the demand for more healthcare facilities. A hospital includes an outpatient department, a medical service block, and inpatient buildings. The area of inpatient buildings usually occupies 35% of the gross floor area of the hospital. In nursing practice, indoor environment quality (IEQ) has a significant impact on the working efficiency of the hospital staff and both the physical and psychological health of the patients [1] . Poor IEQ would reduce the comfort level of the occupants and increase the risk of sick building syndrome occurrence. Furthermore, the demands of different categories of occupants in the inpatient building are highly variable. De Giuli et al. [2] conducted a Post-Occupancy Evaluation in an Italian hospital and indicated that the staff mostly complained about the lack of privacy, room size, and amount of common areas, whereas patients were more satisfied with both the building-related aspects and the indoor conditions and expressed a higher satisfaction level. It is evident that most studies on building IEQ have considered thermal comfort, indoor air quality (IAQ), lighting, and acoustics as the main parameters to determine the indoor comfort level [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Numerous studies have integrated physical measurements and subjective surveys on the above four aspects of IEQ to determine the optimal design of healthcare facilities and better built environments [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

            "text": "With respect to indoor thermal environment, Yau and Chew [13] measured the temperature, relative humidity and air velocity of four hospitals in Malaysia and indicated that only 44% of the examined locations met the comfort criteria specified in the ASHRAE Standard 55-2004. Hwang et al. [14] conducted an extensive field study in a hospital in Taiwan to examine the comfort criteria of ASHRAE Standard 55-2004. They found more than half of all samples were above the relative humidity threshold of 60%. In addition, the results of chi-square tests revealed that physical strength had a highly significant effect on thermal sensation, but gender, age, and acclimatization had not. The frail population expected a warmer condition than the vigorous population. IAQ in vulnerable environments, such as healthcare facilities where patients with frail strength spend almost 100% of their time, is an important issue. Patients, especially those with weak immune system, could contract life-threatening infections in hospitals as a result of poor IAQ [15, 16] . Jung et al. [17] measured the concentration of nine major airborne pollutants, namely CO, CO 2 , O 3 , total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), HCHO, PM2.5, PM10, airborne bacteria, and fungus, at 96 sites from 37 hospitals in Taiwan. Their results demonstrated that the CO 2 and TVOC concentration in inpatient rooms are higher than that in nurse stations, clinics and clinic waiting areas. The mean CO 2 and TVOC concentration in the inpatient rooms are 1063 ppm and 1600 ppb, which are higher than Taiwan's IAQ standard acceptable levels. In five sampled Chinese inpatient buildings, the measured mean concentrations of phthalate esters in the nurse stations, the inpatient rooms and the doctor's offices are 20.66 \u03bcg/m 3 , 20.0 \u03bcg/m 3 and 16.92 \u03bcg/m 3 , respectively, which are higher than that of newly furnished houses, indicating a seriously contaminated hospital indoor air [18] . An assessment of the chemical and microbiological contamination conducted in French hospitals demonstrated that the most frequentlyquantified compounds (ethanol and isopropanol) originated mainly from healthcare activities and uses (hand rubbing) [19] . As multiple pollution sources exist in the inpatient buildings, such as viruses exhaled by patients, bacterial reproduction, and mold breeding, the ventilation system strongly influences the IAQ [20] [21] [22] . Yau et al. [23] indicated the multiple-bed hospital wards pose a risk of infection because communicable and susceptible individuals congregate together, resulting in frequent airborne nosocomial transmission. According to the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation in a hospital-based setting by Jiang et al. [24] , the safe ventilation rate for eliminating airborne viral infection and preventing cross-infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is to dilute the air emitted from a SARS patient by 10000 times with clean air. ASHRAE 170-2017 ventilation of health care facilities requires a minimum outdoor air change rate (ACR) in an inpatient room of 2 h \u22121 to control the indoor IEQ for comfort, asepsis, and odor [25] . However, there is little information about the on-site measured outdoor ACR distribution of functional rooms in inpatient buildings. Furthermore, only a few field studies have investigated the indoor airborne contamination control effect of the outdoor air system in inpatient buildings.",

The outdoor air processor with a rated airflow rate of 6000 m 3 /h is utilized to dehumidify the fresh air for each standard floor plan. Outdoor air first flows through the precooling coil with a supplied water temperature of 16\u00b0C and a return water temperature of 19\u00b0C. Then, the fresh air flows into the heat pump and is processed to the supply air state (SA) with the required humidity ratio of 9.0 g/kg. Outdoor air is utilized to extract heat from the condenser of the heat pump, and then exhausted to the outdoor environment. Since the chilled water for the precooling coil is produced by high temperature chiller with a COP of 6.46 and the heat pump has a COP of 3.58, the series dual cooling sources with different temperature levels could improve the energy efficiency of the outdoor air system.",

The outdoor ACR of the room can be calculated through non-linear fitting of the CO 2 concentration decay curve.

The questionnaire was composed of two parts as shown in Table 3 : 1) basic information about gender, age, type of work and location; 2) satisfaction and sensation on IEQ parameters in summer. A seven-point Likert scale is utilized to quantify the occupants' satisfaction levels with IEQ parameters, ranging from \u22123 (very dissatisfied) to 3 (very satisfied), with a neutral value of zero, as shown in Fig. 5 .

This indicates that the air infiltration from the corridor into the inpatient rooms is not the source of indoor moisture. Because of the high relative humidity, the phenomenon of wall mildew in inpatient rooms and patient corridors occurs during summer.",

The measured air volume of the outdoor air processor was 5050 m 3 /h via velocity measurement. The outdoor air processor consists of series dual cooling sources: a precooling module and a heat pump. The chilled water of the precooling module is provided by high temperature chillers with a measured COP of 6.46. The installed heat pump in the outdoor air processor plays the role of the low temperature cooling source for dehumidification. The heat pump operates with evaporating temperature of 10.5\u00b0C, condensing temperature of 54.2\u00b0C, and measured COP of 3.58. Fig. 9 presents the measured hourly performance (including air temperature and humidity ratio) of the outdoor air processor. As indicated in Fig. 9 (a), the outdoor air temperature was approximately 28-35\u00b0C and the supply air temperature stabilized at approximately 18.0\u00b0C. The inlet water temperature for the precooling module is around 14.9\u00b0C, with a supply and return water temperature difference of 3.8\u00b0C. Fig. 9 (b) shows the outdoor air humidity ratio was around 20.0 g/kg, while the supply air humidity ratio was 11.3 g/kg. In typical summer conditions, the dehumidification capacity of the outdoor air processor accounts for 40% of the total indoor moisture load. The fan coil unit in the inpatient room handles 60% of the total indoor moisture load. Furthermore, the fresh air volumes of the functional rooms in the inpatient building were measured through the CO 2 concentration decay curve method. Fig. 10 plots the outdoor ACR of the functional rooms. ASHARE 170-2017 [25] requires that the outdoor ACR for inpatient rooms and hazardous material storage rooms exceed 2.0 h \u22121 . The average outdoor ACR of 20 randomly sampled inpatient rooms was 1.1 h \u22121 , which is 45% lower than the standard requirement. The average outdoor ACRs of the treatment rooms and the hazardous material storage rooms were 1.6 h \u22121 and 3.0 h \u22121 , respectively. The compliance rates of the inpatient rooms and hazardous material storage rooms for outdoor ACR were 5% and 67%, respectively.",

The average measured outdoor airflow rate of the inpatient rooms was 74.8 m 3 /h. The average measured airflow rate of the exhaust fan in the bathroom of the inpatient room was 45.1 m 3 /h. Because the outdoor airflow rate is larger than the exhaust airflow rate, the inpatient rooms are pressurized. The micro-positive pressure of the inpatient rooms to the outdoor environment suppresses the infiltration of the hot and humid outdoor air. The main moisture source of the inpatient rooms is the occupants and the intermittent shower usage in the bathroom. Owing to the high evaporative temperature of the heat pump, the measured supply air humidity of the outdoor air processor was higher than the design value of 9.0 g/kg. As a result, insufficient fresh air volume and high supply air humidity ratio both lead to the inadequate dehumidification capacity of the outdoor air processor, which further results in an over-humid environment in the inpatient buildings. To solve this problem, the outdoor air processors need to be updated in time to ensure adequate fresh air volume and meet the minimum outdoor ACR requirement and the setting of the heat pumps should be adjusted to supply the fresh air with a humidity ratio of 9.0 g/kg. Therefore, the outdoor air system plays the role of providing ventilation and humidity control separate from temperature control, and the fan coil system plays the role of temperature control in functional rooms.",

            "text": "The Chinese standard (GB/T 51153-2015 [40] ) requires a maximum noise level (A) in the inpatient room and office during the day of 45 dB. Fig. 16 (a) presents the measured noise level (A) in sampled functional sites in the patient buildings during the day. The average noise levels (A) in the inpatient rooms and nurse stations reached 50.7 dB and 61.6 dB, respectively. The compliance rates of the inpatient rooms and offices for noise are 0% and 31.3%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 16(b) , the occupant sensation on noise level ranged from slightly noise to medium noise. The staff perceive noisier than the patients do. According to the survey feedback, the noise sources in the inpatient rooms were the fan coil units and exhaust fan (49%), the occupant conversation (39%), especially in the nurse station area, and the snore (9%). By confirming with the hospital managers, the exhaust fan in the bathroom operates throughout day unless the noise of the exhaust fan strongly interferes with patients' rest. Since the patients and visitors usually gathered in the nurse station area and asked the nurses about the diseases, it is reasonable that the nurse stations were noisy. As shown in Fig. 16(c) , the satisfaction level on the indoor acoustic environment mainly ranged between slightly dissatisfied and slightly satisfied. The dissatisfaction rates of the acoustic environment for the patients, visitors and staff all exceeded 20%, indicating a noisy environment (see Table 5 ). Furthermore, the satisfaction level of the patients in terms of indoor acoustic environment is higher than that of the visitors with a p-value of 0.0019. Fig. 17(a) illustrates the overall satisfaction votes on the IEQ including the thermal comfort, IAQ, lighting, and acoustics. The overall satisfaction level on the IEQ ranged from neutral to slightly satisfied. The dissatisfaction rates of overall IEQ for the patients and visitors were 7.9% and 10.4%, respectively, which were below the target of 20% used by ASHRAE 62.1. However, the dissatisfaction rate for staff was 34.8%. The satisfaction level of the patients was higher than that of the visitors (p < 0.001) and the staff (p < 0.001). One possible explanation for a higher satisfaction level of the patients than the visitors and staff is the patients pay more attention to the illness and recovery than the indoor environment and suffer from the stress of illness.",

Liu and Wang [31] 's field study on IEQ of Chinese hospitals found that in summer, 13% of the relative humidity in Hospital A inpatient rooms located in cold climate area and 60% of the relative humidity in Hospital B inpatient rooms located in hot summer-cold winter climate area exceeded 70%, resulting in the mold problem. In addition, Hwang et al. [14] 's field study on thermal environment of a hospital located in hot summer-warm winter climate area showed that the relative humidity in more than half of the hospital area exceeds 60%. Therefore, improper humidity control in summer is prevalent in Chinese hospitals. Liu and Wang [31] 's field study on Chinese hospitals found IAQ was the least satisfactory among the four major aspects of IEQ (thermal comfort, IAQ, lighting, and acoustics) and indicated that the possible reason is the lack of fresh air supply in the design stage. The dissatisfaction rate of the air freshness was also the highest among the IEQ factors in this paper. The outdoor ACR of the inpatient rooms were proven to be inadequate and 45% lower than the ASHRAE 170-2017 standard threshold through the CO 2 concentration decay curve method. Therefore, facility management personnel should pay more attention to the humidity control and actual fresh air volume which are the common problem in Chinese hospitals.",

The evidence-based design for healthcare facilities reveal that the IEQ influences patient physical-fitness and recovery state. In this study, objective physical measurements and a questionnaire based subjective survey were conducted to investigate the IEQ of Chinese inpatient buildings located in hot and humid region. We measured the IEQ parameters of 170 randomly sampled functional sites: temperature, relative humidity, indoor air quality, light and acoustic environment. The indoor environment of five functional spaces in a nurse unit was continuously monitored for three days. Furthermore, the outdoor air change rates of 32 sampled functional rooms were measured via CO 2 concentration decay curve method to quantitatively evaluate the ventilation effect. The performance of the outdoor air system and fan coil systems was investigated and how the outdoor air system and fan coil systems contribute to the observed IEQ conditions was revealed.

However, the insufficient fresh air volume and high supply air humidity ratio of the outdoor air system both result in the inadequate dehumidification capacity and the over-humid environment in the inpatient buildings.

The standard compliance rate of CO 2 in the inpatient buildings is over 99%, while the dissatisfaction rate of air freshness is more than 25% due to the insufficient outdoor air change rate. The compliance rate of the TVOC concentration is more than 80%, which accords with the dissatisfaction rate of air cleanliness at less than 20%.
