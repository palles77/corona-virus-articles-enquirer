For this purpose, stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) was employed to evaluate the efficiency of the hotel industry on a provincial level in China and to analyze how it is impacted by specialization in tourism and market competition. The results confirm that tourism specialization and market competition exert a synergistic effect on hotel industry efficiency in China. This study finds that tourism development as represented by a high level of tourism specialization by a destination does not guarantee high efficiency in hotels but does enhance the negative effect of market competition on hotel industry efficiency. Significant policy and managerial implications stem from these findings.",

Examining the external factors influencing the efficiency of the hotel industry is crucial in terms of advancing hotel performance and improving the quality of destination accommodation products (Yang and Cai, 2016) . Previous studies have suggested a few external factors such as accessibility, regional economic context, crisis events and trade openness impact hotel efficiency (Assaf and Cvelbar, 2015; Huang et al., 2012; Yang and Cai, 2016) . As an essential component of a destination's tourism product, the efficiency of the hotel industry is inevitably influenced by the overall development level of tourism at the destination. However, the influence of the destination's tourism level as an external factor on hotel industry efficiency has not yet been examined.",

With the continuous expansion of the tourism industry and the growing competition in the hotel industry in most destinations, it is impossible for hotels to run their businesses without considering the level of market competition. Therefore, this study also includes market competition as an external factor that impacts a destination's hotel industry efficiency. The main objective is to examine whether and how the level of tourism specialization and market competition jointly impact hotel industry efficiency using the stochastic frontier approach. This research is conducted in China, where the hotel industry has been developing for over four decades and is currently witnessing a diversifying supply under a booming tourism industry.",

In 2016, the Chinese government initiated the all-for-one tourism development policy (\"Quan yu lv you\" in Chinese), which aims at boosting tourism production at the destination level. In recent years, many provinces in China have encouraged the building of high-end and luxury hotels, expecting that greater investment will boost the industry and allow it to reap higher profits (Wu and Yang, 2018) . According to the former China National Tourism Administration (CNTA, now Ministry of Culture and Tourism), the number of four-and five-star hotels has increased rapidly, from a combined total of 1671 in 2006-3170 in 2017. The intense construction of high-end hotels, however, has not resulted in rapid profit gains. Since 2013, China's hotel industry has been experiencing challenges partially due to the anti-corruption policy launched by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council of China in late 2012. Consequently, the revenue per available room (RevPAR) decreased by 24.9 % from 2012 to 2015, and the occupancy rate dropped from 58.2 % in 2012 to 52.3 % in 2015.",

Numerous studies have been conducted on the internal determinants that influence the efficiency of the hotel industry; however, the influences in the external environment that are closely linked to the destinations' tourism development levels have yet to be adequately examined. With the background of rapid tourism development and fierce competition, the theoretical linkages between external factors and hotel industry efficiency should be consolidated. Many scholars have found that the number of tourists has a positive impact on the efficiency of hotel performance (Assaf et al., 2017) . Higher numbers of tourists often reflect higher tourism specialization, which could be measured by the ratio of the number of tourists to residents in a region or the ratio of the total tourism revenue to regional GDP. Regions that are more specialized in tourism should have greater hotel industry efficiency. Thus, the complex effects of tourism specialization and market competition on the efficiency of the hotel industry merit fuller investigation.",

Compared with the DEA method, SFA assumes an explicit model for the underlying production relationship and allows for inefficiencies and random errors. SFA models also allow deviations from the production frontier to be attributed to both technical inefficiency and measurement error (Barros, 2004; Oliveira et al., 2013b) . SFA can also be used to make statistical inferences for further analysis of hotel industry efficiency and the associated predictors. Thus, SFA is more appropriate than DEA in terms of model assumptions and determinant analysis.",

Given the background of continuous expansion in the tourism industry and growing competition in the hotel industry in most destinations, it is impossible for hotels to run their businesses beyond the influence of these two external environments. The hotel literature has been relatively silent in considering the effects of these two external factors on hotel efficiency with a few notable exceptions. Chen (2010) empirically finds that tourism growth played a significant role in the corporate performance of the Taiwanese hotel industry by increasing lodging demand. Similar results are found in the studies of Chen (2011) and Assaf et al. (2017) . These three studies have a common methodology with a linear perspective. However, as G\u00f6cen et al. (2017) argued, given increased lodging demand derived from the boosting tourism industry in destinations, market competition among hotels becomes more fierce because more competitors swarm into the market. Moreover, Assaf et al. (2017) found evidence that intense competition could harm the performance of hotels. Thus, from a nonlinear view, the manner in which tourism specialization influences hotel efficiency is unclear because its impact on hotel efficiency may change over time, given stages in the development of tourism in which market competition level varies accordingly. In response to Aissa and Goaied (2016b) call to investigate the relationship between contextual factors and hotel performance, this study examines the synergistic effect of both tourism specialization and market competition on the efficiency of the hotel industry.",

Tsai (2009) examines star-rated hotel productivity in China on a provincial basis using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique. By investigating aggregate hotel performance data for domestic and foreign-invested hotels in each Chinese province during the 2001-2012 period, Mao and Yang (2016) analyze FDI spillovers and explain the role of their moderating effects in the Chinese hotel industry. Using panel data of the hotel industry in 31 Chinese provincial regions from 2005 to 2013, Yang et al. (2017) employ the DEA method to show that different regions have different efficiency performance in the various hotel market segments. Liu and Tsai (2018) investigate the total factor productivity (TFP) growth, technological progress, pure technical efficiency change, scale efficiency change, and mix efficiency change of star-rated hotels in China by employing a Hicks-Moorsteen index approach.",

There is a trend to examine the impact of external factors on hotel industry efficiency. However, researchers have investigated these factors independently and ignored their joint effects. Moreover, there have been diverse methodologies in the studies of this field such as the adoption of SFA models. In the current context of rapid tourism development and the fierce competition within the hotel industry of many destinations, there is an urgent need to connect the hotel industry efficiency with the destination's tourism development characteristics. Levels of the hotel market competition and tourism specialization of a destination are strong representatives of the external factors that closely connect the hotel industry with the destination's tourism context. More importantly, the influences of these external factors on hotel industry efficiency may be dynamic and synergetic thus should be further examined. This research adopts the SFA method to examine the effects of tourism specialization and market competition on hotel industry efficiency. In the following section, we develop hypotheses for empirical examination based on the existing literature and our research objectives.",

From the perspective of direct impact, tourism specialization associated with tourism growth can immediately strengthen the development of the hotel industry by increasing the hotel occupancy rate and hence improving operating efficiency. This means that higher tourism specialization within the tourism destination generates a greater flow of tourists and an ongoing expansion of the hospitality market, which in turn ensures a higher demand for the accommodation provided by hotels and, therefore, higher revenues and profits. Accordingly, in tourism destinations with high tourism specialization, a high demand for lodging from the large number of tourists is likely to boost the efficiency of the hotel industry.",

Inevitably, these destinations will have a highly competitive environment, and the associated rising market competition could lead to a loss in hotel market share, which in turn has a negative impact on industry efficiency. Moreover, several studies confirm that tourism specialization may ultimately have a negative impact on the economic growth of tourism destinations through a crowding-out effect when tourism expands beyond a certain level (Pham et al., 2015) . Thus, tourism development represented by the level of tourism specialization at a destination does not guarantee high efficiency in the hotel industry. In general, we assume that tourism specialization has a nonlinear influence on hotel efficiency. Hence, hypotheses 1 and 2 can be expressed as follows:",

In other words, in competitive markets, managers have a strong incentive to give their best effort to improve the efficiency of firms, which has been explained by Leibenstein's X-efficiency theory. Therefore, based on this logic, market competition has a positive influence on the efficiency of hotels.

The contradictory opinion on such issues leads us to a bold hypothesis that the effect of market competition on hotel industry efficiency could be moderated by tourism specialization. Tourism destinations with growing tourism specialization are more likely to attract nonstandard accommodation firms, such as guesthouses and shared accommodations, as these firms prefer engaging in a more mature destination with a prosperous tourism industry (Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2017) .

It assumes that the error term is composite, meaning that it is made up of inefficiency and random disturbance. Therefore, it is understood that an economic entity deviates from the frontier because of both inefficiency and random fluctuations. These fluctuations reflect the effect of variables that are not under the control of an economic entity. The SFA methodology has the advantage of estimating the frontier function and inefficiency effects function in a single-stage sampling procedure, which allows efficiency to be estimated more accurately.",

The key advantage of this model is that it allows an estimation of efficiency for the hotel industry in each province and the factors that explain differences in efficiency between hotel sectors at the provincial level in a single-stage sampling procedure. This methodology is a significant step forward in terms of consistency with respect to previous models that first estimate the inefficiency level and subsequently use a two-stage procedure to assess a number of explanatory variables in an attempt to explain inefficiencies driving differences between regional hotel sectors. In short, we believe that the stochastic model enables the generation of inefficiency levels while simultaneously enabling these scores to be related to a set of explanatory variables.",

In addition, 18 out of the 23 parameters were statistically significant, indicating that the data fit well with the translog production form.

With the coefficient estimates of the production function in Table 3 , we can calculate the output elasticity \u03b5 with respect to capital K and labor L as follows. D. Zhang, et al. International Journal of Hospitality Management 87 (2020) By taking the simple arithmetic mean, the average output elasticity \u03b5 K and \u03b5 L across the whole sample during the observation period are 0.1625 and 0.5337, respectively. The sum of the two is 0.6962 (< 1), which significantly points to decreasing returns to scale in China's hotel industry (Huang et al., 2012) . The marginal benefit of fixed asset investment in hotels is decreasing, mainly due to the existence of serious redundancy in the investments in the fixed assets of star-rated hotels (Yang and Cai, 2016) and particularly in the construction of high end hotels regardless of economic feasibility and actual demand. The consequence is that there is an oversupply of hotel rooms in some big cities because more upscale hotels were built by local real-estate developers on low-cost land without serious consideration of the actual market demand . This perspective facilitates understanding the reasons for the oversupply of high-end hotels and the resulting adverse effects (Yang et al., 2017) . The extensive growth of capital has become an obstacle to the improvement of management efficiency in hotels, and as the sign of the coefficient \u03b2 8 of variable T \u00d7 lnK indicates, over time, the growth of fixed asset investment continues to amplify the inhibiting effect. Although the marginal benefit of labor involved in hotels also decreases, this may be due to the oversupply of trained employees, which in turn decreased hotel industry performance (Yang and Cai, 2016) ; however, the coefficients \u03b2 5 , \u03b2 7 and \u03b2 9 related to labor are not significant. Table 3 also reports estimates of the primary explanatory variables and suggests three main points. First, the coefficient \u03b4 5 of the interaction variable is statistically significant and strong, indicating the existence of synergetic effects under the joint effect of tourism specialization (TS) and market competition (MC). As shown in Fig. 1 , given a value of MC, ln(TE) experiences an increase and then a decrease with the gradual increase of TS. On the other dimension, ln(TE) varies with the value of MC; to be specific, if TS takes a low value, ln(TE) is increasing with the increase of MC, while if TS takes a high value, ln(TE) is declining with the growth of MC.",

Generally, tourism specialization has a negative effect on the efficiency of the hotel industry when the value of tourism specialization exceeds a certain threshold. In other words, the higher the level of tourism development in a provincial region, the lower the efficiency of the hotel industry in the province. This is an interesting finding that seems to be contrary to popular belief that the hotel industry should benefit more from a destination with higher tourism specialization, since we usually conclude that a prosperous tourism industry with many tourists can produce a large potential accommodation market for the hotel industry and thereby boost its efficiency. However, a notable fact cannot be ignored: the rise of nonstandard accommodation suppliers is not only changing the competitive landscape in the hotel industry but also transforming the tourism industry (Heo et al., 2019) . Classic economic theories of demand and supply indicate that increased supply may hurt firm performance by depressing price to a new and lower equilibrium (Assaf et al., 2017) . The rapidly emerging sharing economy in recent years means that accommodation sharing (e.g., Airbnb) is growing quickly and becoming an important market force that is challenging the hotel industry (Xie and Kwok, 2017) and continuing to negatively affect hotel performance (Zervas et al., 2015) .",

Therefore, Hypotheses 3 and 4 are supported. Furthermore, the threshold point here is 0.383, which implies that unless the TS of a province is below that level, the growth of MC is associated with an increase in efficiency, while the efficiency starts to decline with intensified market competition. These findings suggest that the quiet-life hypothesis appears to be valid in the Chinese hotel industry only under the condition where TS is below 0.383. For instance, those hotels in provinces with relatively low tourism specialization have operated in efficiently partly because they have benefitted from market competition, as the hotel industry is also becoming increasingly sensitive to the changing tastes and preferences of tourists seeking accommodation. In the provincial-level destinations with relatively high tourism specialization, such as Shanghai, Guangdong and Beijing, hotels have experienced greater competition from other hospitality businesses, and their efficiency has been suffering from the negative impact of heightened competition.",

We explain that some nonmarket factors, such as the level of government consumption due to corruption, play an important role in the development of star-rated hotels in China. However, the anti-corruption movement has cut off the hotel revenue attached to administrative expenses and disrupted the political connections between star-rated hotels and government officials. Hence, the main channel driving the total revenue of star hotels has been abruptly blocked, with the consequence of lower efficiency (Zhang and Shu, 2018) .",
