However, nurses' understanding and compliance with these precautions is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess nurses' knowledge and practices in relation to isolation precautions in Jordan. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used. The study took place in 8 hospitals in Jordan. A self-reported questionnaire and an observational checklist were developed based on the CDC (2007) isolation precautions guidelines. Results: A total of 247 questionnaires were returned out of 400, for a response rate of 61.7%. The results show that most nurses (90%) have good knowledge of isolation precautions. However, only 65% of nurses reported good compliance with isolation precautions. The results of a t test revealed that nurses with Bachelor's degrees perform better in knowledge examinations than nurses with 2-year diplomas (P < .001). However, there was no significant difference in knowledge and self-report practices scores based on nurses' previous training and existence of isolation guidelines in their units or wards (P > .05). The results of the checklists confirm that there is a low compliance with standard isolation practice. In addition, the checklist shows that a high percentage of units and wards do not use isolation signs (46.4%) and posters (34.5%). Conclusions: This study revealed that educating nurses about isolation is not enough strategy to improve their compliance. It is important to adapt other strategies, such as supporting nurses by giving them a manageable workload, and providing more supplies and reminders of isolation precautions in the hospitals.",

            "text": "Globally, health care-associated infections have become a medical challenge in health care settings. 1 It is estimated that >1.4 million people worldwide get infectious complications in hospitals. 2, 3 The World Health Organization reported a noteworthy incline in the rate of hospital-acquired infection in developing countries in comparison with developed countries. A recent study found that hospitalacquired infection is 5 times higher in developing countries. 4 The rates of device-associated infection range from 8.2-16.1 per 1,000 device-exposed days in developing countries. 5 In Jordan, infectious diseases are still one of the main causes of morbidity. 6 Acute respiratory diseases and hepatitis are 2 of the leading causes of morbidity in the region. 6 In recent years, several infectious agents have emerged such as the Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Avian influenza in humans. 7 Increased national efforts are required to control the spread of these infectious diseases. Medical isolation and infection control practices should be enforced by health care workers to prevent transmission of health care-associated infections. 8 As health care workers, nurses in Jordan form part of the health care team responsible for implementing patient isolation and following standards and disease-specific isolation precautions. 9 However, many previous studies have suggested that nurses do not strictly adhere to these precautions. 5, 10, 11 Other studies claim that nurses' inadequate knowledge about standard isolation precautions could explain why infection control activities are often carried out with poor results in health care settings. [12] [13] [14] However, other studies have claimed that education alone is not enough. 10, 11 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourage the implementation of training programs for health care workers about isolation precautions to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.",

            "text": "The recommendation also includes frequent assessment of knowledge and isolation precautions practices. 8 Many studies across the world have measured nurses' knowledge, attitude, and practice of standard isolation precautions. Most have used descriptive cross-sectional designs and different selfreport tools to measure knowledge, attitude, and practice. The results of the studies highlighted the health care workers' inadequate knowledge about common transmission mechanisms and their improper attitude and practices in relation to isolation standards for infection control practices. The main recommendations of these studies were to focus on infection control in nursing curricula, provide more continuous education programs at the hospitals, apply more monitoring and supervision of standards and isolation precautions, and provide isolation structures and supplies in hospitals. 5, 10, 13, 15, 16 Few studies have investigated infection control knowledge and practice in Jordan. [17] [18] [19] Al-Rawajfah et al 17 reported nurses' lack of adherence regarding principles of infection control. In addition, Al-Rawajfah and Tubaishat 19 found that students demonstrated a lack of knowledge regarding different infection control practices. Similarly, many national studies found that nurses and nurse students have some lack of knowledge regarding different infection control topics, such as prevention of central venous line infection and ventilator-associated pneumonia. These studies concluded that there might be a lack of administration of these topics into nursing curricula and lack of clinical training in the Jordanian hospitals about infection control practices. [20] [21] [22] However, no study was found that assessed nurses' knowledge of isolation precautions and its relationship with their practices. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to assess nurses' knowledge of and practices in relation to isolation precautions in Jordan.",

However, some lack of knowledge was noted in the topics of precautions relating to contact isolation, airborne isolation, and when a negativepressure room should be used. These findings might highlight a defect in curricula in nursing schools and continuous education programs in the participating hospitals. It is consistent with previous studies who revealed poor student nurses' knowledge regarding infection control practices. 17, 21 Several factors contributed to the nurses' lack of knowledge in some topics; one of these was dissatisfaction with the content of the infection control educational courses during their studies. 23 Other factors included a shortage of well-designed infection control programs that targeted health care workers during their clinical practices. 24 Although nurses in this study showed acceptable knowledge about isolation precaution, their compliance was poor. The results show that few nurses reported that they followed standard isolation precautions (52.7%). In addition, few nurses were observed following standard isolation precautions (20.2%) and transmissionbased isolation precautions (11.9%). These findings confirmed that nurses in Jordan were not strictly complying with activities that protect them from the transmission of infectious diseases. Our finding is consistent with the Al-Rawajfah et al 17 study that revealed nurses in Jordan have low compliance to infection control practices. The researchers revealed that the lack of resources is a major barrier for compliance with infection prevention guidelines among Jordanian nurses. Other barriers from the literature that could not be measured in our study include heavy workload 11 and lack of safety climate. 25 Also, the Nmadu et al study 26 reported that lack of supplies and organizational structure were significant barriers to nurses' compliance with isolation precautions.",

Aloush found that nurse to patient ratio and lower unit capacity are significant predictors of nurses' compliance, and concluded that education would not improve nurses' compliance unless their workload was lowered. Barikani and Afaghi 10 also stated that having good knowledge and a positive attitude are not enough to influence nurses' compliance to isolation precautions; providing appropriate supplies and a manageable workload were highly recommended in the study.",

This study was conducted mainly in governmental hospitals that are characterized by high workload and high demand on equipment and supplies. Therefore, it is expected that shortages in these supplies are a major barrier for nurses in trying to follow isolation precautions. This finding highlights the urgent need for the Ministry of Health to support those hospitals with isolation supplies to protect both patients and health care workers. In addition, this finding highlights a significant defect in the policies that are supposed to organize and facilitate nurses' isolation practices, and supports the reports of previous studies that denoted the impact of policies on nurses' compliance. Giard et al 27 reported that organizational structure had a positive effect on nurses' isolation practice, and McCoy et al 28 highlighted institutional healthy climate as a significant predictor for compliance among nurses.",

Another limitation that we have failed to measure other factors that could influence nurses' compliance with isolation precautions. Finally, this study included only Jordanian nurses, which might limit the generalizability of the findings to other settings and other populations.

The Jordanian Ministry of Health and other private and university hospitals should implement more health education programs on infection control and isolation as a part of its disaster plan in case of an infectious disease outbreak. Furthermore, they should consider other strategies, such as implementing more supervision and monitoring of infection control practices, adapting the guidelines into nurses' routine practices, and providing more isolation structures, supplies, and reminders about isolation precautions.
