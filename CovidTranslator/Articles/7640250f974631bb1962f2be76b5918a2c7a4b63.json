There is evidence that cell-mediated responses may be involved and to extend these observations, rotavirus antigen and the three major T cell subsets, BoCD4 +, BoCD8 +, and BoWC1 + 7/~ lymphocytes were immunostained in tissue sections from calves killed at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days post inoculation and quantified by image analysis. It was established that in control calves, BoCD4 + lymphoeytes were predominantly in the lamina propria, while the majority of BoCD8 + and BoWCI +y/6 lymphocytes were in the epithelium. Rotavirus infection was seen throughout the small intestine with the greatest amount of viral antigen detected at 4 days post inoculation in the mid and distal small intestine. Increased numbers of all subsets were detected; small increases in intraepithelial BoCD4 + and BoWCI + 7/J T lymphocytes were observed especially in the distal small intestine, while larger increases in BoCD8 + cells were detected in the epithelium and lamina propria of the proximal, mid and distal small intestine. The timing and location of these increases in T lymphocyte subsets is indicative of a specific immune response involving BoCD8 + and BoWC 1 + 7/~ T lymphocytes.",

Cytotoxic T cells contributed to the immune response of mice to rotavirus; after oral or parenteral inoculation with rotavirus, virus-specific cytotoxic activity was detected among splenic and intraepithelial lymphocytes (Offit and Dudzik, 1989) . Subsequently, in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency, a chronic rotavirus infection was cleared by adoptive transfer of immune CD8 \u00f7 T lymphocytes (Dharakul et al., 1990) and passive protection against rotavirusinduced diarrhoea was induced in the absence of virus-specific antibodies using the same technique (Offit and Dudzik, 1990) .",

In calves killed 2 days after inoculation, the percentage of infected villi did not exceed 4%. The greatest amount of viral antigen was found in the mid and distal small intestine 4 days after inoculation, where up to 85% of villi were infected (Fig. 1 ) . The percentage of infected villi in calves killed 6 days after inoculation was less than 12% in all small intestinal samples, except for Sites 6 and 7 in one calf where 45% and 42% villi were infected. The number of infected enterocytes per villus were greatest at those intestinal sites where the largest percentage of infected villi were detected. ",

The CD8o~ chain has also been detected on a cloned cell line with non-specific killer activity (Goddeeris et al., 1991) and on BoCD2+BoWC 1-7/O'TcR + T cells (Sopp et al., 1991 ) . Natural killer (NK) cells capable of non-specific cytotoxicity are CD8 + in some species (Trinchieri, 1989 ) and non-specific cytotoxicity has been detected in cattle (Cook and Splitter, 1989; Godson et al., 1991 ) , but expression of CD8 was not determined. The CD8 \u00f7 cells which were increased in number in the epithelium and lamina propria in the mid and lower small intestine, the site of most rotavirus infection, were probably cytotoxic T cells because these lymphocytes have been associated with rotavirus infection in mice. It is possible that some or all were other cell types expressing CD8; CD8 + ~/~ TCR + T cells and homodimeric CD8 \u00f7 T cells have been detected by flow cytometry amongst bovine intraepithelial lymphocytes (Parsons et al., 1993a) . Cytotoxic T lymphocytes cleared rotavirus infection in SCID mice (Dharakul et al., 1990 ) and mice were passively protected from rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis by adoptive transfer of immune CD8 \u00f7 lymphocytes (Offit and Dudzik, 1990) . The influx of BoCD8 \u00f7 cells was not immediate and the increase in numbers with time after inoculation was more typical of a specific immune response by cytotoxic lymphocytes than a non-specific response by NK cells (Welsh, 1978) .",
