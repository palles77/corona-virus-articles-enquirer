Despite this, ventilation guidelines in hospitals are not founded on robust scientific evidence related to the prevention of airborne transmission. Methods: We sought to assess the effect of ventilation rates on influenza, tuberculosis, and rhinovirus infection risk within 3 distinct rooms in a major urban hospital: a lung function laboratory, an emergency department negative-pressure isolation room, and an outpatient consultation room. Air-exchange rate measurements were performed in each room using CO 2 as a tracer. The model developed by Gammaitoni and Nucci was used to estimate infection risk. Results: Current outdoor air-exchange rates in the lung function laboratory and emergency department isolation room limited infection risks to 0.1%-3.6%. Influenza risk for individuals entering an outpatient consultation room after an infectious individual departed ranged from 3.6% to 20.7%, depending on the duration for which each person occupied the room. Conclusion: Given the absence of definitive ventilation guidelines for hospitals, air-exchange measurements combined with modeling afford a useful means of assessing, on a case-by-case basis, the suitability of room ventilation for preventing airborne disease transmission.",

All measurements were performed when the rooms were unoccupied. Background concentrations of CO 2 were monitored with a Sable Systems CA-10 CO 2 analyzer (Las Vegas, NV) for at least 20 minutes. High-purity (99.9%) CO 2 was then released and vigorously mixed with room air by 2 fans until concentrations stabilized. The approximate homogeneity of concentration was confirmed by measurements at a minimum of 3 points within each room before the cessation of CO 2 release. A single sampling point was then sited at a central location. The decay of CO 2 was recorded every second until background concentrations were reached. Three repeat measurements were conducted in each room, and for each door position in the outpatient consulting rooms. A total of 18 airexchange measurements were obtained.",

The additional 7.5 hours of occupancy time in the latter case did not have a significant effect on risk, as there were no new sources of influenza quanta in the room. Outpatient consulting rooms Figure 2A shows the modeled influenza quanta concentrations in outpatient consulting room A during a consultation with an infectious individual for up to 120 minutes. The figure also shows the decays in quanta concentrations following departure of the individual after 15, 60, and 120 minutes, including an initial 5-minute period with the room door open. Figure 2B shows the estimated risk of infection for a susceptible individual entering the room after each of these periods.",

In the present study, we focused on producing conservative risk estimates that reflect the real-world activities of individuals (staff, patients, and visitors) at the study location. It is important to keep in mind that our risk estimates are expressed as percentages, and although this is a convenient and intuitive metric, it might not translate to a significant absolute number of infections in a room with low occupancy. 19, 23 The points at which the existing air exchange rate in the Lung Function Laboratory intersects the curves shown in Figure 1 indicate that increasing air exchange further would provide a negligible reduction to an already very low infection risk. The attendant increase in energy consumption required would be difficult to justify when the size of the room and its typical occupancy of up to 10 persons are considered. 24 A similar situation exists in the ED isolation room, where occupancy was low and outdoor air exchange was very high; even in the worst-case scenario, a very low risk of 0.3% was estimated. The ventilation rate in the ED isolation room afforded substantial protection from the 3 pathogens modeled and was approximately twice that recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for airborne infection isolation rooms. 25 Although the real-world bases of prescribed ventilation guidelines are limited, in these 2 scenarios, modeling demonstrated that measured air exchange limited the infection risk to relatively low levels. For both clinical rooms, in the case of a highly contagious airborne infection and/or highly susceptible group, modeling could be useful when conducted on a caseby-case basis to assess the benefit of increasing air exchange on infection risk.",

Airborne transmission is widely acknowledged as the mechanism of spread of tuberculosis, although its role in influenza and rhinovirus transmission is less well established. 16 Nonetheless, there is evidence to support increased airborne transmission of the latter 2 diseases under low outdoor air exchange conditions. 7, 15 Our results suggest that the risk of influenza infection for susceptible individuals entering outpatient consulting room A, although relatively low, are not negligible despite the fact that the total and outdoor air change rates meet guidelines recommended for patient examination rooms and general wards. 10 This further emphasizes the need to develop a rigorous scientific basis for prescribing minimum ventilation rates within a diverse range of hospital environments. 9 It is also noteworthy that natural ventilation can reduce airborne infection risk and energy consumption compared with mechanical ventilation, 26, 27 although this requires a climate amenable to this practice and appropriate planning of the hospital environment.",

Such room-specific idiosyncrasies underscore the potential pitfalls of generalizing results, even between 2 proximate and similar rooms. Notwithstanding this, the infection risk in both rooms could be further reduced by allowing their doors to remain open for longer periods after occupation by a potentially infectious individual. However, reducing the risk in one room occupied by a handful of individuals at the expense of increased risk in more densely occupied adjacent areas (eg, waiting room) would represent a false economy. The infectiousness of the pathogen, the air volume into which it would be mixed, and the number of susceptible persons located nearby would need to be carefully considered and balanced against existing risks before opening doors could be recommended as a general control strategy. Further research addressing this issue is needed.",
