Similar to the RBD in the S protein of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the predicted hCoV-EMC S-RBD also contains a core domain consisting of 5 \u03b2-sheets (\u03b21-\u03b24, \u03b27) and 3 \u03b1-helices (\u03b1A-\u03b1C) 2,3 . However, they have different extended loops between \u03b24 and \u03b27. SARS-CoV S-RBD has a 71-amino-acid (aa)(residues 424-494) extended loop, including two anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets (\u03b25-\u03b26) 2 . Its receptor-binding motif (RBM) is located in this extended loop, which is responsible for directly contacting the residues in the virusbinding site in the SARS-CoV's receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the target cell 2,3 . The hCoV-EMC S-RBD contains a much longer (143-aa: residues 440-582) extended loop, consisting of two anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets (\u03b25-\u03b26) as well as three \u03b1-helices. The first two \u03b1-helices form a V-shaped structure 1 . Since the sequence length and conformation of the extended loop in the predicted hCoV-EMC S-RBD significantly differ",

Most recently, Raj et al 5 have demonstrated that hCoV-EMC's receptor is the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4, also known as CD26). To identify the RBM in the hCoV-EMC S-RBD, we performed a protein-protein docking simulation analysis using our predicted hCoV-ECM S-RBD 1,5 as the ligand and DPP4 as the receptor. Since the native DPP4 is presented in a dimeric form on the cell surface, we used the X-ray structure of the DPP4 dimer (pdb: 1PFQ) 6,7 and the fully automated web server ClusPro 2.0 (http://cluspro.bu.edu) for rigid body docking. The ClusPro 2.0 server uses the newly developed docking program PIPER 8 , which performs a rigid body docking using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) approach with pairwise interaction potential. About 1000 conformations with lowest scores are retained and clustered. We have selected one of the lowest scored docking poses from the 10 best clusters where the RBD of hCoV-EMC docked on the dimer interface of DPP4.",

The tip of the V-shaped structure could even touch the last \u03b1-helix (residues 746-762) in DPP4. This finding suggests that the extended loop region in hCoV-EMC S-RBD, especially the first two \u03b1-helices, contains the RBM that may mediate the binding of hCoV-EMC S-RBD with the virus-binding site of the receptor DPP4 dimer on the target cell.",
