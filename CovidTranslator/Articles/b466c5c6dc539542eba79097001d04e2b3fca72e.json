Graphical representation and numerical characterization of DNA, RNA and protein sequences have exhibited great potential to address these concerns. We review here in brief several different formulations of these representations and examples of applications to diverse problems based on what this author had presented at the Second Mathematical Chemistry Workshop of the Americas in Bogota, Colombia in 2010. In particular, we note several insights that were gained from such representations, and the applications to the bio-medicinal field.",

My background was physics, and I began a search for, to me, a more meaningful exposition of the sequence of characters that represented the DNA sequence. My studies led me to appreciate and anticipate the immense potential opening up with the sequencing of genome length sequences and the concomitant need for rapidly scanning and analyzing DNA sequences for matters of interest [1] , and to get excited at the new insights being gained from a global perspective of the DNA sequences: Jeffreys [2] had shown through his Chaos Generator Representation that such sequences had an inherent fractal nature; Peng et al. [3] speculated that DNA sequences had long-range correlations, an observation that raised a storm of papers in very short order; and Voss [4] showed that long range fractal correlations existed in DNA sequences with the degree of correlation varying with evolutionary divergence.",

Experimenting with various formats I determined that a 2D graphical representation, as explained later in this chapter, was what I could relate to on a purely personal basis. After many graphs of various sequences and discussions with some eminent persons to ensure that such a simple stratagem was not already familiar to cutting edge biologists, I published a paper on it in Current Science (Bangalore) in 1994 [5] . Imagine my consternation when I was informed soon after that Gates had already anticipated such a device, albeit with different axes assignments, way back in 1986 [6] , but which seemed to have been in limbo since!

I had observed certain similarities and changes in plots of conserved gene sequences of various species, but coming up with some way to measure the changes posed difficulties with these plots of discrete numbers. I had done some number crunching with individual gene segments like introns and exons [8, 9] , but now the need was for whole sequences for which we came up with a geometrical interpretation to describe in general a macro-molecular sequence and measure sequence differences. We presented our scheme at the First Indo-US Workshop on Mathematical Chemistry in Shantiniketan, West Bengal, India in 1998 [10] where we reported, as stated in the abstract, that \"Geometrisation of macromolecular sequences in the form of a graphical representation provides one \u2026 technique where the nucleotides in a gene sequence can be viewed as objects in a 4-dimensional space; the method can be extended, in principle, to include, say proteins, in a 20-dimensional space. We have found a reduced 2-dimensional representation of DNA sequences very useful in studies of nucleotide distribution and composition. \u2026. We here propose a new measure of the dispersion of DNA graphs that can be used to quantify the differences between two or more graphs of genes of various organisms \u2026. lt also appears that once standardized the proposed scheme may help study molecular phylogeny in evolutionary time scale.\"",

But Prof. Subhash Basak of the University of Minnesota, USA and co-organiser of the Workshop was intrigued enough by our work and its potential to describe DNA sequences through graph invariants to meet me in Kolkata after the workshop to discuss the possibility of using invariants for DNA sequences as descriptors. Subsequently Prof. Basak invited me the following summer to Duluth to carry out further research on DNA mathematical descriptors in his group funded by the Natural Resources Research Institute (NRRI). Prof. Milan Randi\u0107 and some other distinguished scientists were also invited there to begin to work on DNA descriptors in a project funded by NRRI.",

We collaborated then on a proposal for a 3D graphical representation and a matrix method for extracting graph invariants for the first exons of beta globin sequences of several species. This was published in 2000 in the Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science [12] and led very soon to a whole host of papers on the DNA graphical representations and numerical characterisations and applications of them that continues still as more and more areas keep opening up and a new field of research seems to have begun.",

H J Jeffrey [2] came up with the idea of plotting them in a square grid where the four corners were identified with the four bases A, C, G, T. The algorithm was to start from the center of the square and for the first base plot a point midway between the origin and the home corner of the base. For the second base he started from the point representing the first base and plotted a point midway between it and the home corner of the second base. Continuing in this way filled up the square with a series of points until the entire sequence was plotted. This diagram he called the Chaos Generator Representation (CGR) of the DNA sequence. He noticed that different animal kingdoms showed different patterns -double scoop depletion regions for vertebrates, striped patterns for plant sequences, an apparently random distribution for bacterial genomes. Overall, each sub-square section of the CGR pattern seemed a replica of the whole, i.e. DNA sequences had properties of selfsimilarity or fractal nature.",

[3] considered the structure of the bases in a DNA sequence and analysed them on the basis of their being pyrimidines (C,T) or purines (A,G) only. On an X-Y graph where the x-axis counted the nucleotide number, they plotted the appearance of the bases in a sequence by taking a step diagonally upwards if it was a purine or downwards if it was a pyrimidine to the next nucleotide number. Plotting the whole sequence step by step in this manner they generated a graph with an irregular up-down structure which they called a \"DNA landscape\". By taking subsections of the graph they found that the subsections also looked similar to the up-down structure of the whole, and the same was true of sub-sub-sections and so on showing that the purine-pyrimidine structure of a DNA sequence had self-similarity, which was what Jeffrey had remarked two years ago. Peng et al. then searched for possible correlations by estimating frequencies of different lengths of nucleotide stretches and found that all gene sequences with the mosaic structure of introns and exons had long-range correlations whereas intronless genes did not show this feature. The implications of such an observation, on the face of it, are huge: the beginning of the DNA sequence should, theoretically, be knowing what the end would be like! Such an observation quite naturally led to a storm of papers on the subject until it quitened down after the observation that since DNA sequences are known to elongate by duplicating long stretches of subsequences, it was possible that such sequences showed apparent long range correlations.",

This problem was addressed many years ago by Hamori and Ruskin [25] with their proposal for a 3-dimensional graphical representation of a DNA sequence. They proposed a hypothetical square on the xy plane with four corners (NW, NE, SE, SW) identified with the four bases A, C, G, T and the nucleotide number to be counted along the z-axis. Thus for a DNA sequence like ACGGT, one would plot a point on the A-corner at z-coordinate 1, then draw a line to the next base, C in this case, in its corner with z now equal to 2, and so on. For a sequence like ACGTACGTACGT this would generate a spiral around the z-axis; in case there was a preponderance of one base or the other the curve would flow along those corners. These curves the authors called H-curves. Visualizing such a 3D image on the 2D plane of the paper is admittedly difficult. However, the authors suggested that drawing two such curves at slightly different angles would allow stereoscopic vision so that the DNA could be seen in 3D. Taking the bacteriophage M13 as an example they showed that in their representation they could easily identify regions of sharp changes in base composition through visualization that would be difficult to determine from the normal character representation.",

The method is to take a walk in the negative x-direction if there is an adenosine in the sequence, in the positive ydirection for a cytosine, positive x-direction for a guanine and the negative ydirection for thymine. Proceeding to walk in succession in the appropriate direction in the order of the bases making up the particular DNA sequence generates a path that visually depicts the arrangement of bases in the sequence. These DNA plots were found to be characteristic of the types of gene sequences and that the same genes from different species showed almost the same pattern. Since we know that specific genes from different species have significant homology, and in fact that is how often new genes are recognized, it is not surprising that their graphical plots will show basically the same shape.",

On a 2D Cartesian co-ordinate system the assignments of the bases with the cardinal directions in the three schemes are, starting from the negative x-direction and going clockwise, GTCA (Gates), ACGT (Nandy) and CTAG (Leong and Morgenthaler).

Plots such as these provide a quick estimation of base composition and distribution along a DNA sequence. An inspection of the human beta globin sequence graph shows that it has two sections that are mainly A-T rich with one part in between that is T-dominated. A plot of a sequence like the chicken myosin heavy chain gene is represented in illustration 2 (loc. cit.,) shows that it also is AT-rich; from the angle it makes with the axes, it is evident that the sequence is dominated by larger percentage of T's than A's, and likewise one can determine preponderance of structures like AmTn from inspections of such plots.

Bieli\u0144ska-W\u0105\u017c et al. [28] have shown that this can be accounted for by a mathematical method of using a weight parameter for each visit to the same location, but a number of researchers has been to propose different ways to represent DNA sequences graphically that reduces or removes this degeneracy. An extensive coverage of these methods can be found in Nandy, Harle and Basak [16] , but we may mention here that one of the first proposals to reduce the degeneracy was the scheme of Guo, Randi\u0107 and Basak [29] where the unit vectors for the four bases were aligned at a small angle to the cardinal directions. Yau et al. [30] used a two-quadrant representation in 2D space where A,G were inclined to the x-axis in the 4 th quadrant and T,C were inclined to the x-axis but in the first quadrant, and the nucleotide count was recorded along the x-axis; this generated a DNA graph extending in the positive x-direction and had no degeneracy. He et al., [31] proposed to characterize a DNA sequence by their chemical (amino, keto), structural (purine, pyrimidine) and bond strengths (weak, strong) and plotted this set of three reduced sequences as characteristic curves that extended along the x-axis with nucleotide number thus avoiding degeneracy altogether. Randi\u0107 proposed several constructs, among them a 4 horizontal line scheme [32] where the four bases were plotted in order of the sequence along four lines parallel to the x-axis and placed unit distance apart wile the nucleotide number was again counted along the x-axis, a compact \"worm curve\" representation [33] , four-color maps [34] , \"spectrum-like\" curves [35] among others which reduced or eliminated the degeneracy inherent in the classical 2D approach.",

For the variations within a sequence arising from the base distribution, we had observed [27] that coding regions of mammalian gene sequences appeared as a dense cluster of points in the 2D graphical representations implying high degree of mixing of the four bases in almost equal proportions, whereas the non-coding regions that were A-T or G-C rich usually appeared as long filaments. We therefore devised a cluster density measurement by enclosing such regions in a square grid and dividing the number of points in the grid by the area of the square. This was complemented by an inverse displacement method and a fractal coefficient method to numerically assess the differences between these two types of regions. Analysis of 386 introns (noncoding regions of a gene) and exons (coding regions) of 35 genes from various species by these measures showed [27] that (a) cluster density of non-coding regions are very small and fall off exponentially rapidly, (b) the cluster density of coding regions grows to about 0.8 per unit area and falls off gradually, (c) exons of evolutionarily later genes have higher cluster densities, (d) cluster densities of intronless genes like the phage M13 genome or the bacteriophage lambda are very low, closely paralleling intron densities and (e) more recent genes show greater fragmentation and smaller lengths of the exons. The cluster density measure also enabled us to propose a way of predicting protein coding regions in new DNA sequences [41] and was used to analyse the human chromosome 3 contig 7 and predict existence of several genes [42] .",

For the initial presentation we computed the first order moments as weighted center of mass only and defined a graph radius, g R , the distance of the weighted center of mass from the origin, for each sequence and a \uf044g R to estimate the difference between two sequences plotted on the same scale; this scheme gave a reasonable fit to the dispersion of the beta globin genes from various species [11] . Because of the cumulative nature of the sequence plots, differences in base distributions will lead to progressively increasing differences in the plots. Closely related sequences with less mutational changes between them will have smaller \uf044g R while unrelated sequences can be expected to lead to larger values of the \uf044g R . As remarked by the authors, this method could clearly be generalized to apply to the case of protein and other sequences where one may represent the sequences in a multidimensional hyperspace with a view to eventually develop phylogenetic trees.

            "text": "The graph theoretic method arose out of deliberations after the first presentation of the 2D graphical representations in Duluth in 1999. The method described in the paper by Randi\u0107, Vracko Nandy and Basak [36] was to first represent a DNA sequence graphically in a 3D Cartesian grid and then convert the points to elements of a matrix by computing the ratio of Euclidean distance to graph theoretic distance between all possible pairs of points taken systematically. Matrix methods are well studied and have well recognized properties. The D/D matrix generated by the distance measures was analysed to yield a set of eigenvalues with the leading eigenvalue being taken as invariant of the matrix and therefore of the sequence. Differences between the leading eigenvalues of various gene sequences could then be taken as indicative of their evolutionary distances, although this seminal paper limited itself to computation on the basis of the first exons of 11 beta globin genes only. The interesting point to note is that this paper led to generation of intense interest among researchers and many different ways of representing DNA sequences and computation of evolutionary distances subsequently ensued (see review Nandy et al. [16] ). Authors such as Randi\u0107 et al. [33] , Randi\u0107 [35] , He and Wang [45] , Song and Tan [46] and many others proposed different ways to graphically represent DNA sequences and convert the plots to mathematical objects, and derive leading eigenvalues as invariants of the sequences. For example, He and Wang [45] reduced the DNA sequences to a set of three sequences based on their structural, chemical and bonding nature and devised a vector of the three leading eigenvalues of the matrices associated with each of the reduced sequences which they proposed as being characteristic sequences of the original DNA sequence. Distances between two sequences then were computed by determining the distances between the end points of the two vectors. Song and Tan [46] similarly devised a 24-component vector characterizing a sequence, others came up with other ways of computing the intersequence distances based on vectors devised out of the matrix eigenvalues. Such matrix invariants from their own representations were used by Liao et al. [47] , Wang et al. [43] , Liao et al. [48] and others to draw phylogenetic trees for mitochondrial genes, SARS coronavirus genomes, etc. The graph theoretic method, however, does not seem to have been applied so far to determine specific features within a sequence.",

Although Meeta Rani [49] had shown as early as 1998 the presence of statistical self-affinity, a kind of self-similarity, in protein sequences that implies a fractal nature, graphical representation methods for proteins drew attention with the paper of Randi\u0107 [50] . The basic idea here was to start with the CGR method of Jeffrey to plot a RNA sequence drawing triangles for every triplets of bases, i.e., the genetic codes, and taking the centers of each such triangle as corresponding to the residue the triplet would code for. Thus starting with the mRNA, this method generates a CGR-equivalent 2D graphical representation for the protein sequence. Randi\u0107 et al. [51] carried the method further to construct a zigzag curve for the A-chain of human insulin which allows a direct conversion of a protein sequence into a numerical sequence of (x,y) coordinates that can be used subsequently for construction of the graph-theoretic matrices and sequence invariants. The technique was refined to remove some arbitrariness that were inherent in the 2D scheme by converting the 2D graph to a 3D graphical representation where the triplets were assigned to the corners of a tetrahedron structure; although visual inspection of the graphical patterns had to be discarded in this scheme, the authors claimed that construction of graph invariants in this manner was more accurate and unique.",

By covering the entire sequence for all strains we could get a good profile of regions of least variability. The next step was to determine which parts of the sequences were surface exposed. There are several on-line engines available to scan a sequence and assign parameters to predict the degree of probability that certain portions were surface exposed. Matching these predictions with the hard facts we had on low variability we were able to identify six regions in the neuraminidase protein that were surface exposed and largely stable to mutational changes.

We have described quantitatively the gross features of the graphical plots in the 2D representations by using the first moments in a geometrical method [10, 11] ; better descriptors can be determined through higher order moments [28] to quantify the curvature, skewness and other properties. These, and the leading eigenvalues from the graph theoretic approach, could be considered as a list of parameters describing the sequence, akin to the quantum numbers that are used to describe elementary particles.

In the matrix method applied to different varieties of graphical representation, leading eigenvalues arising from the matrices have been taken as \"invariants\" of the sequence in the strict mathematical sense. However, the concept of invariants derived from these matrix methods of numerically characterizing DNA sequences may require some modification to account for the fact that DNA sequences constantly change due to mutations in the bases. The vast majority of these changes do not affect the functioning of the protein or the enzyme coded by the gene due to synonymous mutations in the coding segments or in the non-coding part; e.g. in the case of intronless gene like the neuraminidase of the avian flu H5N1 we had found [69] 447 out of total 682 sequences prevalent over the period 1997 to 2008 had undergone mutations in one or more bases in the gene, but even then, all of these variants coded for a functioning flu neuraminidase protein. For a beta globin gene, the common standard example of most graphical representation schemes, a sample from one person may differ by a base or more from the next person due to mutational changes. Determining an \"invariant\" from one sample sequence of these genes, while being mathematically precise, may not adequately express or characterize a gene sequence from a practical point of view. Perhaps a biologically more relevant measure would be a sampling of several such sequences and from them to compute an average eigenvalue with a standard deviation and derive a numerical to characterize the gene. In fact, in the absence of a sensitivity analysis or a standard deviation, it would be difficult to accept that the computations through leading eigenvalues of distances between several sequences that are only a few percentage points apart could be statistically meaningful. The descriptors are no exception either.",

One way to circumvent this difficulty is to work on small segments of the sequence at a time as had been done in Ref. [62] .
