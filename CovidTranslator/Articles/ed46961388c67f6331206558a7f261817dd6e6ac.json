            "text": "The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to a major concern of the potential for not only an epidemic but a pandemic. Although most of the cases are still occurring in Hubei province, China, there are some other epicenters developing in China. COVID-19 appears to be highly contagious. It is classified as a type of RNA virus, belonging to the family of coronaviruses, which primarily leads to a respiratory system infection. One of the primary findings for COVID-19 is pneumonia. [1] [2] [3] Although the exact origin of COVID-19 remains unknown, the first reported cases were all linked to the Huanan (Southern China) Seafood Wholesale Market where wild animals (such as bats) were sold illegally. [2] [3] [4] Evidence has also been found that it can be transmitted from human to human through respiratory droplets, contact and even via fecal-oral transmission. [3] [4] [5] [6] Although control measures have been applied to prevent further spread in China, including isolation of people suspected to have the disease, the need for better diagnosis and treatment of patients with pneumonia is no longer limited to Wuhan, especially with the huge turnover during the spring festival period. The infection of COVID-19 is spreading fast with increasing numbers of infected patients nationwide and worldwide. Wenzhou is a city located in Zhejiang province with a population of 9.25 million. Wenzhou people are usually merchants by profession and frequently travel from city to city or work and live in other cities for business purposes. Currently, approximately 180,0 0 0 Wenzhou residents live in Wuhan and 33,0 0 0 Wenzhou people have been detected returning from Wuhan and its surrounding areas according to the Wenzhou city government new released on Jan 29, 2020. As consequence, Wenzhou is reported as the city with the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside Hubei province in China. By Feb 15th 2020, according to the government announcement, there are 66,580 confirmed cases reported in China, 1162 cases reported from Zhejiang province and 499 cases reported from Wenzhou city. 7 Serious cases of COVID-19 can develop severe pneumonia, ARDS and multiple organ failures leading to death, while non severe cases present ordinary symptoms of respiratory system infection. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The mortality and rate of severe cases up to Feb 15th 2020 in Hubei province and Wenzhou city were 2.6% vs 0% (1457/54,406 vs 0/499) and 15.2% vs 5.2% (8276/54,406 vs 26/499), showing a significant regional difference. 6 However, little is known about COVID-19 outside Wuhan, although Chang et al. 8 reported 13 cases in Beijing and Guan et al. 9 reported 1099 cases in all of China. In Guan et al's study, the statistical analysis was done at the level of the whole cohort, no regional analysis was performed 9 .",

In contrast, virulence will decrease through long term host-parasite interactions. 12 But it should be mentioned that virulence is often an indirect effect of the pathogen, such as an inappropriate immune response 12 ).

The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral GGO, mixed GGO or consolidation with predominance in the lower lung (S6,10), with more extensive mixed opacity than GGO and consolidation is highly suspicious of 2019-nCoV infection when considering an interval between symptom onset and CT examination of 7.61 (7) days. The description of imaging features has been limited in the clinical literature. Our findings are compatible with other small sample size (51 and 21 cases) radiological publications. 19 , 20 Since the form of lesion could be oval sometimes instead of patchy, physicians and radiologists should keep in mind the diversity of imaging presentations of COVID-19. Human coronaviruses are considered as important pathogens that cause respiratory infection. There were two other previous coronavirus outbreaks, including (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. All these three coronavirus infections have similar common radiographic manifestations at presentation, including unilateral or bilateral GGO or consolidation, while COVID-19 shows more extensive GGO than consolidation, which is consistent with the clinical scenario. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] All reported patients in Wuhan showed pulmonary infiltration in chest computed tomography (CT). 2 , 4 , 6 However, Guan et al. 9 reported 230 out of 1099 (20.1%) cases and Chuang et al. 20 reported 3 out of 21 (14.3%) having normal CT scans for patients diagnosed with symptoms plus RT-PCR positive findings. In our study, 17 out of 149 (11.4%) of our patients had normal chest CT on admission and 12 remained negative 10 days later. This finding suggests that a normal chest CT scan cannot exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19. Therefore, clinicians et radiologists should still suspect patients with typical symptoms, such as fever, cough, lymphopenia, and exposure history, and give them an RT-PCR test.",
