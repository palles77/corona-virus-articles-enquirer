R.S.-virus infections were more severe than others and occurred mostly in the first five months of life, with a peak at two months. Rhinovirus infections occurred at all ages, and often involved the lower respiratory tract. Of the 12 deaths, only 1 (due to R.S. virus) was not associated with a contributory cause. Maternal antibody to R.S. virus did not notably affect the incidence or severity of R.S.-virus infections.",

In our hands the C.F. test was a more sensitive method than isolation for diagnosis of R.s.-virus infections in the infants where both methods were attempted. 7 R.s.-virus infections were diagnosed by demonstrating a change from passive to active antibodies,9 for which it is necessary to do a cumbersome chequerboard titration, but most showed straightforward rises in titre when a large amount of antigen was used in the C.F. test. Berglund and Strahhnann 12 conclude that isolation is better than serology. Much will depend on the potency of the C.F. antigen, the number of antigen units used, and the time of taking the convalescent serum 13; and the sensitivity of the cell line used for isolation and the timing of inoculation are also important. Other Respiratory Pathogens The diagnosis-rate for all respiratory pathogens of 53% might have been higher if paired sera had been obtained from all the infants, and if serology for viruses other than R.s. virus had been performed.

Over the past nine years in the Bristol Public Health Laboratory, among large numbers of parainfluenza viruses isolated, parainfluenza types 2, 3, and 4 have only occasionally been isolated from infants under four months of age, and type 1 never. This is not a new observation, and there is evidence that maternal antibody protects against these viruses. 24 Our experience with influenza virus is similar, and in this survey there were no influenza virus infections below the age of four months. Maternal antibodies probably played their role here also. On the other hand, rhinovirus infections were detected from a very early age, and this is to be expected because mothers would not have antibodies against all rhinovirus types at the time of delivery. Indeed maternal antibody may protect against infections with this group of viruses. The position with regard to R.s.-virus infections is less clear-cut. For instance it is widely accepted that the majority of severe infections occur in the first three months of life. In our series the peak of incidence was at two months, and infections have been recorded as early as ten days after birth. 25 There is no multiplicity of antigenic types to account for this early incidence as there is for rhinoviruses. On the other hand, the incidence of antibodies to R.s. virus in the adult population-and by implication exposure to R.s. virus-is very high. One would expect, therefore, the epidemiological features of this infection in infants to resemble influenza more closely than the common cold.",

Neither is there any concrete evidence in table vil to support the hypothesis of antibody potentiation, for although at two months of age the geometric mean titre of antibody is higher in the group with R.s.-virus infections, as is the percentage of acute sera with antibody present, this trend is reversed at one month of age. Similarly there is no correlation between high antibody titre and mean severity grade. Although the numbers are extremely small, there was evidence in table v that in the first month of life infants had less severe R.s. infections than older infants. This could be taken as evidence that maternal antibody may actually have a protective effect. Chanock et al. 3 found that the titre of R.s.-neutralising antibody was two times lower in the acute sera of infants with R.S. infections than in those without, and suggests that antibody-antigen complexes in the lung may lead to depletion of antibody in the serum.",
