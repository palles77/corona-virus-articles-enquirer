In situ hybridization of glial cell cultures infected with MHV-A59 again showed enhanced MHC mRNA expression, both in infected and uninfected cells . These results extend our earlier finding that MHC surface antigens are enhanced on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes after MHV-A59 infection and suggest that this enhancement is a result of an increase in the steady-state level of MHC mRNA . We further demonstrate that increases in MHC mRNA occur in the murine central nervous system (CNS) following infection in vivo . Northern blot analysis of RNA from the brains of infected animals showed transient expression of both MHC class I and class II mRNA over the first 14 days of infection . Expression coincided with viral replication and clearance . In situ hybridization of brain sections from infected animals showed that class I and class II expression was widespread throughout all portions of the brain and in uninfected as well as infected cells . Viral RNA, in contrast, was observed in small foci of cells and mostly within the limbic system . Thus enhancement of MHC mRNA was not restricted either to areas of infection or inflammation . The spatial relationship between viral and MHC expression supports our hypothesis that a soluble mediator is involved in the mechanism of the increase in MHC levels . The fact that MHC induction occurs in vivo as well as in vitro suggests MHC may be important in the mechanism of MHV-induced disease .",

Since more than 95% of cells in these cultures are astrocytes or precursors of astrocytes (as measured by reaction with anti-GFAP serum) and in excess of 80% of the cells are positive for MHC mRNA, MHC-enhancement clearly occurs in astrocytes .

Class I mRNA was first observed 1 day after infection, prior to the onset of detectable viral RNA synthesis as well as inflammatory cell infiltration . At the later times post-infection that were examined (3-16 weeks), class I and class II expression showed some variability . For example, neither was expressed at elevated levels 3 weeks pi, but both were present at high levels at 4, 6 and 8 weeks pi . It is tempting to speculate that the increases seen at 4-8 weeks pi might be occurring at times of active demyelination . Elevated levels of MHC mRNA were observed in cells without detectable viral RNA, demonstrating that the enhancement was not occurring solely in infected cells, consistent with the results from primary glial cultures . Furthermore, cells with detectable MHC mRNA were found throughout the brain, while inflammatory cells were found in foci, particularly in perivascular regions . These data along with the observation that MHC class I induction occurs in primary cultures of glial cells (both GFAP-positive and GaIC-positive) suggest that it is unlikely that MHC mRNA enhancement in the CNS is only a result of inflammatory cells . However, the rather focal regions of class II expression may result, at least in part, from inflammatory infiltrates in the brain . The increase in MHC expression did not appear to be part of a general effect of infection on cellular mRNA levels since actin mRNA levels remained constant . The results also show that increases in MHC expression during infections in vivo are similar to increases observed in vitro in infected glial cell cultures .",
