The VEEV nsP2 protease is a member of MEROPS Clan CN and characteristically contains a papain-like protease linked to an S-adenosyl-L-methionine dependent RNA methyltransferase (SAM MTase) domain. The protease contains an alternative active site motif, 475 NVCWAK 480 , which differs from papain's (CGS 25 CWAFS), and the enzyme lacks a transition state (TS) stabilizing residue homologous to Q19 in papain. To understand the roles of conserved residues in catalysis we determined the structure of the free enzyme, and the first structure of an inhibitorbound alphaviral protease. The peptide-like E64d inhibitor was found to bind beneath a \u03b2-hairpin at the interface of the SAM MTase and protease domains. His-546 adopted a conformation that differed from that found in the free enzyme, each conformer may assist in leaving group departure of either the amine or Cys thiolate during the catalytic cycle. Interestingly, E64c (200 \u03bcM), the carboxylic acid form of the E64d ester, did not inhibit the nsP2 protease. To identify key residues involved in substrate binding, a number of mutants were analyzed. Mutation of the motif residue, N475A, led to a 24-fold reduction in k cat /K m , and the conformation of this residue did not change after inhibition. N475 forms a hydrogen bond with R662 in the SAM MTase domain, and the R662A and R662K mutations both led to 16-fold reductions in k cat /K m . N475 forms the base of the P1 binding site and likely orients the substrate for nucleophilic attack or plays a role in product * CORRESPONDING AUTHOR FOOTNOTE.

An Asn homologous to N475 is similarly found in coronaviral papain-like proteases (PLpro) of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus and Middle Eastern Respiratory virus (MERS). Mutation of another motif residue, K480A, led to a 9-fold decrease in k cat and k cat /K m . K480 likely enhances the nucleophilicity of the Cys. Consistent with our substrate-bound models, the SAM MTase domain K706A mutation increased the K m 4.5-fold to 500 \u03bcM. Within the \u03b2-hairpin, the N545A mutation slightly, but not significantly increased the k cat and K m .

It is a positive-sense RNA virus (1). The zoonotic arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) can be transmitted via mosquitos to birds, horses, rodents, humans and other vertebrate species (2;3). Equine are unusually susceptible to the virus, and fatality rates for horses are 20-80 % (3). VEEV is both neuroinvasive and neurotropic; the virus replicates in both lymphoid tissue and in the brain (3;4). VEEV causes acute viral infections which are typically resolved by innate and adaptive immune responses, however, neurological symptoms occur in approximately 14 % of infected humans and ~1 % of cases result in lethal encephalitis (3;5). The more deadly Eastern (EEEV, 36 % mortality (6)) and Western (WEEV, 10 % mortality (7)) equine encephalitis viruses share 53 % and 46 % sequence identity with VEEV, respectively. The related Old World alphaviruses such as Chikungunya (CHIKV), have only been associated with fever, arthralgia, and skin rashes (8;9). VEEV viral particles are unusual in that they are highly resistant to desiccation and can be stably lyophilized and aerosolized (3;10-12). Inhaled virus can pass into the brain via the olfactory neurons (4;13;14), which has implications for its use as a biological weapon.",

However, two vaccines are used under Investigational New Drug (IND) status to protect laboratory personnel (15). The live-attenuated VEEV vaccine, TC-83, protects against both subcutaneous and aerosol exposure in animals, and ~82 % of vaccinated humans develop immunity after vaccination (15). A formalin-inactivated vaccine derived from TC-83 called C-84 (16) protected against subcutaneous infection, but failed to protect against aerosol exposure (17) suggesting poor induction of mucosal immunity. Some small molecule inhibitors targeting host or viral proteins have been identified (18-20), but none have been shown to directly inhibit the viral nsP2 cysteine protease or have significant effects on WEEV or EEEV. For viral encephalitis, poor neuronal and blood-brain barrier (BBB)permeability limit the effect of most antivirals. Hu et al. ",

The viral RNA encoding the nonstructural (ns) proteins of VEEV is translated into a single polypeptide, nsP123 or nsP1234 (1) . The nsP2 cysteine protease cleaves the nsP1234 polypeptide into four proteins (nsP1234 \u2192 nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, nsP4) (21;22) ( Figure 1 ). The nsP2 polypeptide contains a short N-terminal region (23) , a helicase domain, a cysteine protease domain, and a S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent RNA methyltransferase domain (SAM MTase) ( Figure 1A ). Alphaviruses cause a lytic infection of mammalian cells and the nsP2 protease-SAM MTase also plays a role in the cytopathic effects (CPE) of the virus (24) (25) (26) . Temperature-sensitive mutations which lead to altered plaque phenotypes have been localized to the nsP2 protease-SAM MTase (26;27) and have been referred to as non-cytopathic effect variants (non-CPE). Some non-CPE mutations are near the predicted substrate binding site, while others are present on the SAM MTase domain distant from the active site (e.g. P713S). VEEV nsP2 localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleus (28) , and the high pI of the SAM MTase domain (pI = 9.45) is typical of a nucleic acid binding protein. These two domains are not only found linked together in alphaviruses, but also in Hepatitis E virus (HEV) (29) . However, in HEV the SAM MTase and cysteine protease domains are permuted.",

While three-dimensional structures of the VEEV and CHIKV nsP2 protease-SAM MTase domains (PDB 2HWK (30) and PDB 3TRK (31) , respectively) have revealed details of the protease domain assembled with the SAM MTase domain (44) (45) , substrate or inhibitor bound structures have not been previously reported. Comparison of the VEEV nsP2 cysteine protease (PDB 2HWK) with other cysteine proteases suggests that the peptide substrate binds within a cleft formed by the protease and SAM methyltransferase domains ( Figure 1B ) (30;32) . However, residues within the SAM MTase domain have not been formally shown to be required for proteolysis. Notably, the Clan CN nsP2 cysteine proteases of alphaviruses contain an alternative active site motif, 475 NVCWAK 480 , which differs from papain's (CGS 25 CWAFS), and lacks a key TS-stabilizing residue homologous to Q19 in papain.",

This is the first report of an inhibitor bound alphaviral nsP2 protease structure. To investigate the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, we performed kinetic and site-directed mutagenesis studies to identify key active site residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis. The structure of the peptide-like E64d adduct shows that the inhibitor binds beneath a \u03b2-hairpin at the interface of the SAM MTase and protease domains, and that His-546 adopts a different conformation from that in the apo state, which may be relevant to its role in leaving group departure in the catalytic cycle. A number of key residues in both the protease and SAM MTase domains were found to have significant effects on protease activity or substrate binding. The hydrogen bonding interactions between the inhibitor and enzyme may be beneficial for future inhibitor development. columns were purchased from G. E. Healthcare (Pittsburgh, PA).

The inhibitor-bound enzyme was crystallized in Condition #8, this condition produced the strongest density for the inhibitor. Enzyme in 50 mM Tris pH 7.6 was inhibited with E64d, excess inhibitor was removed using a PD-10 column. The inhibited enzyme (17 mg/mL) was mixed 1:1 with 0.2 M ammonium formate, 20 % PEG 3350 (condition #8 of the JCSG+ screen). Rod shaped crystals were obtained in hanging drops at 17 \u00b0C. Crystals were soaked in drop solution containing 30 % glycerol, looped, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data was collected at 150 K using a Bruker Micro-STAR rotating anode equipped with Helios optics and a Bruker Platinum 135 CCD area detector. The crystals of the free and bound enzyme diffracted out to 1.66 \u00c5 and 2.16 \u00c5, respectively, on our home source. The space group, P2 1 2 1 2 1 , was the same as for the previously reported structure of the free enzyme (PDB 2HWK, 2.45 \u00c5 resolution, pH 8.0 (30)), however the unit cell dimensions and crystal packing differed. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using PDB 2HWK (30) as the starting model and Amore (42) . Model building was performed using Coot (43;44) . Simulated annealing was carried out using CNS 1.1 (45) and maximum likelihood refinement with Refmac5 (46).",

            "text": "E64d is a membrane permeable pro-drug for in vivo inhibition of calpains and Cathepsin B (50;51). In the cell the E64d ester is hydrolyzed by esterases to produce the negatively charged E64c acid (52) . Many cysteine proteases are readily inhibited by E64d and E64c; papain is inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of E64c (53) . E64c also inhibits Cathepsin B, H, and L (54-56). We evaluated the inhibitory activities of these two cysteine protease inhibitors against the VEEV nsP2 cysteine protease using both continuous and discontinuous assays and a cell-based ELISA assay. E64d weakly inhibited VEEV nsP2 (Figure 2A ). Using the method of Kitz and Wilson (57) the maximal rate constant for inactivation k 2 = 0.05 \u00b1 0.02 min \u22121 and the dissociation constant, K p = 40 \u00b1 10 \u03bcM, were measured for timedependent inhibition in the absence of DTT. In discontinuous assays (SDS-PAGE gels) overnight incubation of E+I+S at room temperature (RT, 23 \u00b1 3 \u00b0C) without DTT led to complete inhibition using 200 \u03bcM E64d, however, 200 \u03bcM E64c did not significantly inhibit the enzyme (Supplemental Fig. S1 ). In cell-based assays both E64d and E64c were ineffective at 50 \u03bcM, and no reduction in viral replication was observed ( Figure 2B ). The only difference between the two inhibitors is the carboxylic acid vs. the ester. Analysis of the E64d binding model of the nsP2 cysteine protease indicated that the negatively charged oxygen of the E64c acid would be near His-476-N\u03b41 and Cys-477-S \u2212 . Further comparison with four other cysteine proteases (papain, actinidin, Cathepsin L and Cathepsin K) showed that the carboxylic acid of the related E64 inhibitor was within hydrogen bonding distance of Gln-19 in these enzymes. A residue homologous to Gln-19 is notably absent in the VEEV nsP2 cysteine protease and may account for the inhibitor specificity. Thus, the negatively charged thiolate may make E64c binding unfavorable.",

In overlays of the free and bound structures (PDB 5EZQ and 5EZS) one conformer of His-546-N\u03b41 was within hydrogen bonding distance to the ester oxygen which mimics the amine leaving group (Figure 3 ). In the E64d inhibited enzyme the His side chain was displaced by a water molecule, and could be refined with an occupancy of 0.8 to a position closer to the Cys-477-S\u03b3. The density for the imidazole ring was poor suggesting static or dynamic disorder. The alternate conformer may allow the His to assist the thiolate leaving group.

Previous studies of the substrate models with nsP2 were limited to the P1\u2032-P4\u2032 site (32) . We extended the substrates from P6 to P6\u2032 in the binding models as these residues are important for substrate recognition. In serine proteases the substrate specificity is largely determined by the P1 residue, whereas in cysteine proteases the P2 residue (underlined glycine) of the protease cleavage site motif, AG(A/C)\u2193(G/Y/A), is highly conserved and the P1 residue is variable (64) . In our models the glycine hydrogens of the P2 residue are directed towards the Trp-478 and Ile-542 side chains which may explain why larger amino acids are not accommodated at this position. All predicted models adopted favorable binding interactions at the C-terminal end of the substrate peptide (P1\u2032-P6\u2032) that was pointed down towards the SAM domain ( Figure 4A) . Interestingly, the C-terminal end of the substrate underwent significant conformational changes in the MD simulations and was also found to point upwards towards the protease domain ( Figure 4B ). The upward binding model appeared to be more stable with extensive interactions with residues surrounding the active site, placing the carbonyl oxygen of the scissile bond closer to the active site Cys. Based on the binding models, we identified several key residues important for substrate binding and performed site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis as described below.",

An Asn is not present in the papain motif, but is present in the VEEV motif. The corona viral proteases, MERS PLpro (65) and SARS PLpro (66), also contain an Asn homologous to Asn-475. This Asn was proposed to stabilize the transition state (67) . However, in our structure of the E64d-inhibited VEEV nsP2 cysteine protease the side chain of Asn-475 is directed towards the backbone carbonyl of Asp-507 on the SAM MTase domain (2.9 \u00c5 from the carbonyl oxygen) and no conformational changes are observed, suggesting that this residue likely does not stabilize the oxyanion via direct hydrogen bonding. In addition, the Asn-475 side chain is within hydrogen bonding distance of the Arg-662 guanidinium group, and this hydrogen bonding interaction remains intact in both the E64d structure and in our P3/4 substrate bound model. We mutated both Asn-475 and Arg-662 to examine their functional roles in substrate binding. The N475A mutation led to a 7-fold reduction in k cat and a 4-fold increase in K m , while mutation of Arg-662 to either Ala or Lys led to a 16-fold reduction in the k cat /K m and the reductions were predominantly due to reductions in k cat (Table 3) . Thus, consistent with the structural model, Asn-475 may play a role in positioning the substrate for nucleophilic attack, and the hydrogen bonding interaction between Asn-475 and Arg-662 may further stabilize substrate binding.",

Sulfur is a poorer hydrogen bond acceptor than oxygen. Papain was able to hydrolyze a C=S substrate analogue, whereas in a similar experiment carried out with serine hydrolases no detectable hydrolysis was observed (70) . A second key difference noted by Asboth et al. is the separation of charges in the ground state vs. the TS (71) . In serine hydrolases the ground state is neutral and a separation of charges occurs during the TS (i.e. the His acquires a proton, and the oxyanion forms) and the oxyanion must be stabilized by hydrogen bonds. In cysteine proteases a negatively charged thiolate is present in the ground state and ion pairs with an imidazolium of a His; in the TS the negative charge of the Cys-S \u2212 migrates to the carbonyl oxygen while the His remains protonated. Based upon their data Asboth et al. concluded that there was a minimal requirement for oxyanion hole residues in cysteine proteases (69) (70) (71) .",

In vitro studies have shown that the papain like Cys protease of MERS also has a relatively low k cat /K m when compared with papain (72) . This suggested the absence or substitution of an active site residue(s), or the absence of an intracellular activator (e.g. calpains are activated by calcium). Papain utilizes Gln-19 and the backbone NH of the nucleophilic Cys to stabilize its transition state ( Figure 5A ). Mutation of Gln-19 to serine (Q19S) reduces its k cat /K m 500-fold (73) . The Clan CN VEEV cysteine protease lacks a residue homologous to the transition state stabilizing residue, Q19, in papain. Interestingly, the VEEV nsP2 cysteine protease is not the only viral cysteine protease lacking a residue homologous to Gln-19 in papain. Trp-107 in the SARS PLpro is thought to stabilize the oxyanion (72) in a manner similar to Gln-19 in papain. Trp-107 was mutated to Ala and no activity was observed (67) ( Figure 5B ). Lin et al. noted that in the MERS PLpro the Trp is replaced by a Leu, a residue which cannot function as a hydrogen bond donor ( Figure 5C ), and then showed that the mutation of the Leu to Trp actually increased the k cat /K m 23-fold (72) . Consequently, the WT MERS PLpro has a lower k cat /K m than the SARS PLpro (72) . MERS has a higher mortality rate than the SARS virus suggesting that the slower rate of turnover is not necessarily detrimental to the virus.",

The lack of TS stabilizing residues may not only impact turnover, but also inhibition of the enzyme since most cysteine protease inhibitors are covalent. For instance, the lack of inhibition of the VEEV nsP2 by 200 \u03bcM E64c may be associated with the absence of a residue homologous to papain's Gln-19. Gln-19 is within hydrogen bonding distance to the carboxylic acid of E64, the compound from which E64d and E64c are derived (53) .",

            "text": "Mutagenesis studies have been traditionally used to identify residues important to catalysis; however, the conformation of a residue is also important in the assignment of a proposed function. Asn-475 is conserved in both Old and New World alphaviruses, and was investigated here for a potential role in TS stabilization. In the structure of the free enzyme, the E64d adduct, and in one of our P34 models we found the Asn-475 side chain hydrogen bonded to the side chain of Arg-662 and to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Asp-507 ( Figure 5D ). This residue did not rotate towards the carbonyl oxygen of the E64d inhibitor. In the Clan CN VEEV nsP2 cysteine protease only one backbone amide NH was within hydrogen bonding distance of the carbonyl oxygen of the E64d inhibitor consistent with minimal stabilization of the oxyanion in the TS ( Figure 5 ). In the SARS PLpro Asn-110 which is homologous to Asn-475 had been proposed to play a possible role in TS stabilization (67) , but similarly was not observed to rotate towards the carbonyl oxygen in the substrate bound C112S variant (PDB 4M0W) (74) . While the N475A mutation affects k cat and k cat /K m , the orientation of this side chain is not consistent with oxyanion stabilization by direct hydrogen bonding. Asn-475 forms the base of the P1 binding site and likely orients the substrate for nucleophilic attack or plays a role in product release. Notably, the corona virus motif (DNNCYL) of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV PL pro ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) papain like proteases (66;72) also contains an Asn at the n-2 position relative to the nucleophilic Cys, and this Asn aligns with Asn-475 in the Clan CN motif ( 475 NVCWAK 480 ) when the Cys-His ion pairs of these proteases are superposed ( Figure 5 ).",

While peptide substrates have been previously modeled at the interface of these two domains, the substrate binding site had not been confirmed by structural or mutagenesis studies. Using a covalent peptide-like inhibitor and X-ray crystallography we determined the first inhibitor bound structure of a Clan CN protease and confirmed that the substrate binding site is complemented by the SAM MTase domain. We have shown that at least three residues, R662, K705, and K706, within the SAM MTase domain are used by the cysteine protease for substrate binding and recognition. Mutation of these residues led to significant reductions in k cat /K m (12 to 60-fold) and underscored the importance of the SAM MTase domain to protease activity. The structural and kinetic characterization of key active site residues within the conserved motif, not only provides insights into the catalytic mechanism of the nsP2 cysteine proteinase of VEEV, but should also assist in structure-based development of novel and potent antiviral drugs.",

            "text": "Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. Organization of the VEEV nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2). (A) The nsP2 contains: an Nterminal region of unknown function, a helicase domain, a cysteine protease domain, and a SAM methyltransferase (MTase) domain. The nsP2 cysteine protease cleaves the nonstructural polypeptide into 4 segments (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, nsP4). The cleavage is essential for viral replication. (B) The cysteine protease and SAM MTase domains are shown in white and green, respectively. The substrate is thought to bind beneath a \u03b2-hairpin (colored red) which forms a beak-like protrusion. The peptide-like E64d inhibitor was found beneath the \u03b2-hairpin and is shown in blue stick (PDB 5EZS). (A) Time-dependent inhibition of the VEEV nsP2 protease by E64d. (B) Structure of the E64d prodrug. In cells esterases convert the E64d ester to the E64c acid. E64c is a prototypical cysteine protease inhibitor, but did not significantly inhibit the protease. E64d inhibited the enzyme in vitro, however, no inhibition of viral replication was observed with E64d or E64c in cell-based assays. (C) Proposed mechanism for covalent inhibition based upon the observed density in the E64d-inhibited enzyme structure. (D) Structure of the E64d VEEV nsP2 cysteine protease adduct (PDB 5EZS). The carbonyl oxygen of the ester was within hydrogen bonding distance of the Cys-477-NH (2.8 \u00c5), this interaction likely stabilizes the TS in the enzyme-catalyzed proteolytic reaction. Other nearby NH groups were not directed towards the carbonyl oxygen. Asn-475 and Arg-662 were found hydrogen bonded in the adduct and no conformational change occurred in these residues upon inhibitor binding. Proposed mechanism of the VEEV nsP2 Clan CN cysteine protease. (A) The mechanism is based upon the structures of the bound (PDB 5EZS) and free (PDB 5EZQ) enzyme described here. His-546 was found in two different conformations (lower panels) which may be relevant to different steps in the catalytic cycle. In one conformation His-546 could form an ion pair with the Cys-S\u03b3 thiolate. In the free enzyme the side chain of Lys-480 was also directed towards the Cys-S\u03b3. During the catalytic cycle His-546 may rotate away from the Cys-S\u03b3 in order to donate its proton to the amide nitrogen and facilitate the collapse of the tetrahedral TS and release of the free amine. (B) In overlays, the second conformation of the His-546-N\u03b41 was near the E64d ester oxygen and was well positioned to donate its hydrogen. Notably, the Asn-475 side chain did not rotate towards the carbonyl oxygen. Asn-475 forms the base of the P1 binding site and remained hydrogen bonded to Arg-662 and to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Asp-507. Binding models of the VEEV nsP2 P34 substrates. (A) The C-terminal portion of the substrate (colored in light pink) was found directed downwards towards the SAM MTase domain, or (B) upwards towards the protease domain. The N-terminal portion of the substrate is colored in magenta. In both models the P4 residue (color in blue) interacted with K706. In the P34 model on the right the carbonyl of the scissile bond was closer to the Cys-S\u03b3. The hydrogen bond between R662 and N475 was maintained in the model on the right, and broken in the other. Other substrate bound models can be found in the Supplemental Information. (C) The 25-residue cleavage site sequences which were embedded between the YFP and CFP fluorescent proteins to make the substrates are shown for VEEV. The 17-and 25-residue SFV substrate sequences are also shown. The cleavage sequences for CHIKV are shown for comparison. The nomenclature of Berger and Schechter is used to identify residues on the amino (P1, P2, etc.) or carboxy (P1\u2032, P2\u2032, etc.) termini of the scissile bond. The P4 residue is colored, and the arrow indicates the location of the cleavage site. Cleavage sites in between the nonstructural proteins contain a common motif, AG(A/C)\u2193(G/Y/A). The P4 residue (colored) differs significantly between the Old and New World alphaviruses and is thought to be specifically recognized by residues in the SAM MTase domain (K705 and K706 in the VEEV nsP2).

Rates of spontaneous hydrolysis were measured in the absence of enzyme, and were subtracted from the enzyme catalyzed rates. Data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation, v o = (V max *[S])/(K m + [S]) using Grafit (Erithricus Software Ltd.). For variants with K m values greater than the highest substrate concentration tested the values of K m were distantly extrapolated from Lineweaver-Burk plots of 1/v o vs. 1/[S]. The k cat /K m values were also calculated from the slope of the linear part of the Michaelis-Menten plot at substrate concentrations less than the K m (39) for comparison with the k cat /K m determined from the extrapolated values.",

Cysteine proteases utilize the backbone NH of the Cys and in some cases the side chains of various residues to stabilize the transition state. The architecture of the active site is distinctly different from that of a serine hydrolase which utilizes two to three backbone NH groups to form an oxyanion hole. Notably, the Asn-110 in the SARS protease, the Asn-111 in the MERS protease, and the Asn-475 in the VEEV protease are present at the n-2 position relative to the Cys and are conserved. The Asn does not hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate or inhibitor in the SARS PLpro or in the VEEV nsP2 cysteine protease, respectively.",
