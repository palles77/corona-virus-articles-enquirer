            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Republic of Korea: transparency and communication are key T he 2015 outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Republic of Korea is the largest outbreak outside the Middle East since MERS was discovered in 2012. Its origin was a single imported case after the patient travelled to endemic countries. 1 Together with Ebola and avian influenza epidemics, MERS has presented yet another threat to global health security. 2 Risk communication is one of the core capacities identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005) . 3 According to WHO outbreak communication guidelines, the five key points for outbreak communication are: (1) build, maintain or restore trust, (2) announce early, (3) be transparent, (4) understand the public, and (5) incorporate risk communication into preparedness planning. 4 In addition, in the event of an outbreak, the role of risk communicators is to align the public risk perception with the scientific view. 5 They must maintain the visibility and legitimacy of their message, understand the political and social environment and understand the specific cultural milieu. 5 Risk communication in the early stage of the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea could have been improved. For example, the decision of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to turn its Twitter account (@KoreaCDC) private for a day on 4 June 2015 triggered an outcry from the scientific community. 6 The Twitter account was made public again on 5 June.",
