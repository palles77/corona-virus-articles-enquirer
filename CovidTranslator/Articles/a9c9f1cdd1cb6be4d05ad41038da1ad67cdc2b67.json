While ECoV is likely to be pathogenic to horses, it has not been shown that experimental inoculation of horses with ECoV produces clinical signs of disease. In this study, we inoculated three Japanese draft horses with an ECoV-positive diarrheic fecal sample to confirm infection after inoculation and to investigate the clinical course and virus shedding patterns of ECoV. Virus neutralization tests showed that all three horses became infected with ECoV. Two of the three horses developed clinical signs similar to those observed during ECoV outbreaks, including fever, anorexia, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. All horses excreted a large amount of virus into their feces for more than 9 days after inoculation regardless of the presence or absence of clinical signs, which suggests that feces are an important source of ECoV infection. ECoV was also detected in nasal swabs from all horses, suggesting that respiratory transmission of ECoV may occur. Both symptomatic horses developed viremia, while the asymptomatic horse did not. White blood cell counts and serum amyloid A concentrations changed relative to the clinical condition of the inoculated horses; these may be useful markers for monitoring the clinical status of horses infected with ECoV. This is the first report of induction of clinical signs of ECoV infection in horses by experimental inoculation. These clinical and virological findings should aid further investigation of the pathogenesis of ECoV.",

There have been multiple outbreaks associated with ECoV at a racecourse in Japan [9, 12, 13] , and in 2011-2012, outbreaks occurred in adult horses in the United States [14] . Recently, ECoV was detected in diarrheic and respiratory samples in Europe [8] . Fever, anorexia, lethargy, leukopenia and diarrhea were the main clinical signs observed in the horses involved in these outbreaks. ECoV is likely to be pathogenic to horses; however, experimental inoculation of horses with ECoV has not been reported to produce clinical signs of disease. An experimental model is necessary to understand the pathogenesis of ECoV. The objectives of this study were to confirm infection and to investigate the clinical course of disease and virus shedding patterns in horses experimentally inoculated with ECoV. ",

The horse had watery diarrhea for 5 days prior to collection of the sample. Virus neutralization tests on paired serum samples collected from this horse showed seroconversion against ECoV. The ECoV-positive sample was stored at -80\u00b0C until inoculum preparation. We attempted to isolate ECoV from the sample using HRT-18G cells as described previously [12] , but were unsuccessful. Prior to administration, the sample was tested for other pathogens associated with intestinal disease, including equine rotavirus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and Salmonella species. Testing for equine rotavirus was performed using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification [10] . Previously described culture methods were used to screen for Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and Salmonella species [11] . The inoculum was negative for equine rotavirus, Clostridium difficile and Salmonella species, but Clostridium perfringens was isolated from the sample. The sample was diluted 1:10 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 1000 ml of this 10 % fecal suspension was administered into the esophagus of each experimental horse using a transnasal catheter while under sedation. The suspension contained 4.2 9 10 9 copies/head of the ECoV nucleocapsid gene; the method used to determine copy numbers is described later in this section.",

Viral RNA was eluted using elution buffer (100 ll) and stored at -80\u00b0C prior to use. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using a previously described primer set [14] and TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time RT-PCR was performed in 20-ll reaction mixtures containing 4 ll of template, which was control RNA or extracted fecal samples (equivalent to 0.4 mg of feces) or nasal swabs or blood samples (equivalent to 4 ll of nasal swab or blood sample). Thermal cycling conditions To create a standard curve for the real-time RT-PCR reaction, control ECoV RNA was synthesized as described previously [10] . In brief, a DNA fragment including the nucleocapsid gene was generated from viral RNA prepared from the NC99 strain by conventional RT-PCR using the primer set for ECoV-Nf and ECoV-Nr [12] . The product obtained in the first amplification was used as a template for the second amplification, which was performed using the primer pair T3-ECoV-Nf (5 0 -attaaccctcactaaagggagaatgtctttcactcctggcaagc-3 0 ), containing the T3 promoter sequence, and ECoV-Nr. RNA was synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase, and the RNA copy number was calculated from its absorbance value at 260 nm. Real-time RT-PCR was performed twice on triplicate samples of tenfold serial dilutions of control RNA (2 9 10 8 -2 9 10 0 copies/ 4 ll). The results indicated that the real-time RT-PCR could reliably detect as few as 200 copies/reaction. In contrast, at 20 copies/reaction, only five out of six samples were positive for ECoV, and the average Ct value of the five positive samples was 36.0 cycles. Detection after 35.0 cycles is less reliable, and therefore, we decided for the purpose of this study that real-time RT-PCR could reliably detect a minimum of 200 copies/reaction. Two hundred copies per reaction corresponds to 5.0 9 10 5 copies per gram in feces and 5.0 9 10 4 copies per milliliter in nasal swabs and blood samples. All real-time RT-PCR reactions were performed in duplicate and average copy numbers were calculated.",

Horses 1 and 2 were also anorexic at 2-4 and 4-6 dpi, and excreted pasty feces at 2-8 and 6 dpi, respectively. In contrast, horse 3 did not develop any clinical signs during the study period. Horse 1 became leukopenic (Fig. 2 ) and lymphopenic at 2-4 dpi, and at 2 and 4 dpi, respectively; however, although the white blood cell counts of horses 2 and 3 tended to decrease, they did not reach levels sufficiently low to be considered leukopenic. The SAA concentrations of horses 1 and 2 were abnormally high for 7 and 4 days, and peaked at 3 and 4 dpi, respectively (Fig. 3) . The fecal samples collected at 2-8 (horse 1) and 2-6 (horse 2) dpi were negative for Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella species. All horses began to shed ECoV RNA in their feces at 3 or 4 dpi and continued shedding the virus until 12 or 14 dpi. The amount of ECoV RNA in the fecal samples peaked at 7 or 8 dpi, and peak copy numbers ranged from 2.7 9 10 9 to 5.5 9 10 10 copies/g (Fig. 4A) . ECoV RNA was detected in nasal swabs from horses 1, 2 and 3 at 6-10, 5-14 and 7-10 dpi, respectively.

We previously attempted to reproduce the clinical signs of ECoV infection by experimental administration of cultured ECoVs to Thoroughbred horses but failed to induce clinical symptoms of disease [Nemoto, unpublished data] . However, BCoV is closely related to ECoV, and experimental inoculation with BCoV-positive fecal samples or intestinal contents has reproduced the clinical signs of BCoV infection in several experimental challenge studies [15] [16] [17] . In addition, ECoV outbreaks in Japan have been reported only in Japanese draft horses.

            "text": "Two of the three horses in this challenge study developed clinical signs similar to those seen during ECoV outbreaks, including anorexia, pyrexia and soft feces. Although Clostridium perfringens was isolated from the inoculum, it was not isolated from the fecal samples collected during the days on which the two horses showed clinical signs. This suggests that Clostridium perfringens was not related to the clinical symptoms of disease. The results of serological testing indicated that all horses were infected with ECoV; however, one horse showed no signs of illness, suggesting that subclinical ECoV infection can occur in some horses. None of the horses in this study developed severe watery diarrhea similar to that of the horse from which the inoculum was obtained. This is consistent with previous reports that diarrhea was observed in only some of the affected horses during ECoV outbreaks [12] [13] [14] , and these findings suggest that additional factors The log-transformed (base 10) values of ECoV gene copies per gram or milliliter are shown. Samples that had less than 5.0 9 10 5 (10 5.7 ) copies/g in feces and 5.0 9 10 4 (10 4.7 ) copies/ml in nasal swabs and EDTA blood samples were considered negative for ECoV may be associated with induction of diarrhea in ECoVinfected horses. Isolation of ECoV in cell culture is difficult [7] , and therefore, real-time RT-PCR was used to investigate virus shedding patterns in the horses infected with ECoV in this study. The two symptomatic horses became viremic, while the asymptomatic horse did not. Leukopenia and lymphopenia were observed only in horse 1, which had a viral load of more than 10 6 copies/ml in EDTA blood; the white blood cell count of this horse increased as the ECoV load decreased. White blood cell count has been shown to be closely related to clinical symptoms in horses infected with ECoV. SAA, which is used as a marker of inflammation in equine clinical practice because it closely reflects changes in clinical conditions [5] , increased in the two symptomatic horses in concordance with clinical signs. Thus, white blood cell count and SAA may both be useful markers of ECoV infection in horses.",

Because of the large amount of virus shed into the feces, the main transmission route of ECoV is likely fecal-oral.",

In addition, the virus was shed from the nasal tracts of the two horses that developed fever even after the horses became afebrile. In Europe, ECoV was also detected from a respiratory specimen within a few days after the onset of clinical signs [8] . In previous studies using field samples from the outbreaks in 2009 and 2012 [12, 13] , ECoV was not detected in nasal swabs. This may be because the nasal swabs were collected during the early stages of fever development in these previous reports. As ECoV was not inoculated via the respiratory route in our current study, viral infection of the respiratory tract was probably secondary to the viremia that resulted after infection of the intestinal tract. However, in horse 3, viremia was not detected, but ECoV was isolated from nasal swabs. Therefore, we hypothesize that another route, such as lymphogenous transmission, may be related to the spread of the ECoV within the host. BCoV, which is closely related to ECoV, is transmitted to other cattle via both the respiratory and the fecal-oral route [6] , and it is therefore possible that respiratory transmission of ECoV may also occur. Alternatively, it is possible that the nasal tract was secondarily infected with ECoV via exposure to feces on the floor of the stall. To clarify the route of transmission of ECoV, future virus challenge studies using respiratory tract inoculation should be performed.",
