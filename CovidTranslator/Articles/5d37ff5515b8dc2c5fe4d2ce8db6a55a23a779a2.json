These interactions develop from the coevolution of pathogen and host and often lead to a species specificity of the virus that can make interspecies transmissions difficult. Nevertheless, viruses do sporadically cross species barriers into other host populations, including humans. In zoonotic infections, many of these interspecies transfer events are dead end, where transmission is confined only to the animal-to-human route but sometimes viruses adapt to enable spread from human to human. A pathogen must overcome many hurdles to replicate successfully in a foreign host. The viral pathogen must enter the host cell, replicate with the assistance of host factors, evade inhibitory host products, exit the first cell and move on to the next, and possibly leave the initial host and transmit to another. Each of these stages may require adaptive changes in the pathogen. Although the factors that influence each stage of the replication and transmission of most agents have not been resolved, the genomics of both hosts and pathogens are now at hand and we have begun to understand some of the molecular changes that enable some viruses to adapt to a new host.",

The first feat is replication in human cells. This replication requires a virus to accomplish at least five steps: first, contact with a human host; second, entry into the appropriate cell type; third, production of more copies of itself; fourth, overcoming any immediate host response; and fifth, exiting from the cell and transmitting to another.

Coronaviruses, by contrast, generally show a restricted host range that is mediated by specific interaction of the viral spike protein with glycoproteins on the host cell surface 5 . Although this is a species-specific interaction, Thackray and Holmes 6 have shown that the alteration of only a few residues in the amino-terminal region of the viral spike protein can extend the host range of a mouse coronavirus to nonmouse cells.

The main reservoir of influenza A viruses is the aquatic birds of the world, from which viruses sporadically transmit to other hosts in whom they can adapt and form stable lineages. Influenza viruses from avian and human sources preferentially bind different forms of the virus receptor on the host cell, namely, sialic acid. Avian influenza viruses have a preference for sialic acid that is linked to the galactose unit in a \u03b12-3 conformation, whereas human viruses preferentially bind those with a \u03b12-6 linkage 10,11 . This binding preference makes biological sense when one considers the host environment in which these viruses grow. The gastrointestinal tract of avian species contains predominantly \u03b12-3-linked sialic acid, in contrast to the abundance of \u03b12-6 linkages in the human respiratory tract.",

Avian H5N1 viruses were transmitted from infected poultry to humans on at least 18 occasions in 1997 despite their retention of avian virus-like receptor specificity 16 . Similarly, contemporary H9N2 viruses circulating throughout Asia are confined primarily to avian species, despite a move to a more human virus-like receptor specificity 17 . Recent studies by Matrosovich et al. 18 suggest that the receptor-mediated host range factors for influenza viruses might be more subtle than the simple presence or absence of the appropriate receptor. In an elegant set of experiments, these investigators showed that human viruses with a \u03b12-6 receptor preference almost exclusively infect nonciliated human tracheal cells during the early phase of replication, whereas avian viruses with a \u03b12-3 preference target ciliated cells 18 (Fig. 2) . Thus, the host range barrier for replication of viruses in humans may not be necessarily at the level of binding, but rather at the level of targeting the appropriate cell type.",

A proposed, albeit unproven, explanation is that this area of NS5a interacts with a host protein and changes in this interaction induced by the amino acid substitutions improve the ability of the virus to replicate in Huh7 cells. From these and similar experiments it can be shown that, like the substitutions that can accommodate changes in receptor usage, slight alterations in amino acid composition in viral proteins can substantially alter viral replication.

Once a host recognizes an invading organism, specific and nonspecific immune responses are initiated that are charged with protecting the body from serious threat. As far as viral replication in humans is concerned, one of the first nonspecific lines of defense that must be overcome by a virus is the IFN response. IFN was first described by Isaacs and Lindenmann 20 in chicken chorioallantoic membranes infected with heat-inactivated influenza A virus. These landmark studies showed that a substance (IFN) produced from infected cells had the capacity to protect surrounding cells from viral infection. Experiments expanding on these original observations showed that, although viral replication was necessary for the expression of IFN, partially inactivated viruses were more potent IFN inducers 21 . These results strongly suggested that components produced during viral replication were actively repressing the expression and/or action of IFN. It is now known that this is indeed true, and many viruses have evolved mechanisms with which to antagonize the host IFN response. Type I IFNs are produced by most cell types in response to viral replication and are crucial components of the host innate response to viral attack. The production of IFN leads to the activation of numerous gene products, some of which have direct antiviral activity 22 . The ability of a virus to replicate successfully in a given host therefore requires the virus to overcome this potent antiviral response. As a direct consequence of this challenge, viruses have developed various mechanisms by which to counteract the host IFN response. Krug et al. 23 have referred to this phenomenon as 'intracellular warfare.' In this war, if the virus has an effective mechanism with which to combat the IFN response of the host, the virus wins the battle and its replication ensues. If, however, the virus does not have the appropriate IFN inhibiting abilities, the battle is won by the cell and viral replication is aborted.",

In this interaction, the IFN antagonistic activity has been suggested to result from the binding and sequestering of dsRNA by NS1, followed by the subsequent inhibition of dsRNAmediated activation of the protein kinase PKR 30 . Other interactions, such as Hendra virus V protein binding to complexes of STAT1 and STAT2 (ref. 26) , proteins involved in downstream IFN signal transduction, or the proposed binding of influenza A NS1 protein to cellular factors involved in post-transcriptional modifications 31, 32 , require a more specific context. It thus follows that in cases where specific interactions are required, the ability of an IFN antagonist to adapt to specific host factors must be an essential step in the successful emergence of a pathogen in an alternative host. Indeed, it has been shown that the host range of paramyxovirus can be controlled by the viral V protein and that this host range is determined by the interaction of V with STAT2 in a species-dependent manner 33 .",

Fortunately for the human population, the number of emerging diseases is small considering the numerous viruses that exist in animal reservoirs. Nevertheless, history and experience tell us that successful adaptations of animal viruses to the human host, albeit relatively rare, do occur. Many of the emerging diseases that threaten humans are caused by RNA viruses and this is not by chance. One of the continuing themes in the above discussions is that viruses need to adapt in perhaps numerous ways to cross the species barrier successfully. Of all pathogens, RNA viruses are most, although not exclusively, able to achieve this.",

RNA viruses have few or no proofreading mechanisms and many mutations are introduced during replication. As such, RNA viruses exist as a quasispecies comprising viruses of slightly different genetic composition. Thus, when selective conditions arise, such as the conditions present after jumping to a new host, variants with an advantage are quickly amplified. It can therefore take only limited replication under suboptimal conditions before an adapted virus emerges. Unfortunately, the evolution of viruses is not only confined to point mutations inserted during replication. Viruses can also undergo leaps in evolution NATURE MEDICINE SUPPLEMENT VOLUME 10 | NUMBER 12 | DECEMBER 2004 S79 NATURE MEDICINE SUPPLEMENT VOLUME 10 | NUMBER 12 | DECEMBER 2004 S79 through the processes of recombination and reassortment. These processes achieve population heterogeneity in viruses through the acquisition of large sections of genomic material from other viruses. Reassortment occurs in viruses with segmented genomes when sections of different viruses are exchanged on dual infection. Both the Asian (1957) and Hong Kong (1968) human influenza pandemics arose through reassortment of human and avian strains 34, 35 . Global health authorities are concerned that the same may happen with the H5N1 viruses that are currently circulating in birds in southeastern Asia, with the result being a virus that is transmissible in humans. Unfortunately, we know little about the conditions for successful reassortment and it is difficult to assess the possibility of this happening. The available evidence from influenza A viruses is that there is a selective rather than random mechanism for packaging RNA segments into infectious virions 36 and not all combinations of viral genes are compatible. Recent findings from vaccine development have shown that the surface proteins of the H5N1 influenza viruses are at least compatible with older human strains 37 , suggesting that reassortants of H5N1 and human influenza virus may well be viable. Arenaviruses are also capable of reassortment, although reassortment again does not seem to be completely random and some combinations of genes do not seem to be compatible 38 . Nevertheless, there has been some speculation that reassortment may have contributed to the emergence of new arenaviruses with disease associations 38 .",

A significant omission from this review is any discussion on HIV-perhaps the single most important viral agent to emerge in recent times. But the fact is that we know very little about the molecular changes that led to the emergence of HIV. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that several interspecies transmissions from simian species introduced two genetically distinct types of HIV into the human population-HIV-1, which is closely related to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from chimpanzees, and HIV-2, which is closely related to SIV from sooty mangabeys (reviewed in ref. 43); however, the molecular changes that enabled the virus to adapt to its new host are unknown. Indeed, data from the HIV field is instead revealing several new cellular proteins that create intracellular barriers to virus replication and restrict virus host range. Some of these socalled 'restriction factors' seem to have evolved as a result of an evolutionary association with endogenous retroviruses (reviewed in refs. 44, 45) .",

The number of new molecular tools available to the virologist has lead to a greater resolution of factors that restrict viruses to certain hosts. In addition to numerous tools with which to dissect these cellular factors, the development of reverse genetics systems for many RNA viruses has facilitated the manipulation of the viral genome to an extent that was not previously possible. For example, the resurrection of several pieces of the 1918 Spanish influenza genome 46, 47 provides the possibility that a genomic analysis of virus and host will explain the extreme pathogenicity of the 1918 outbreak of Spanish influenza that killed up to 50 million people worldwide. Perhaps the greatest advances in the next decade will come from a genomic and proteomic analysis in which all of the interactions between a parasite and a host can be resolved. These areas are the engines that will drive our understanding of both host range and the avenues that are available to a pathogen to overcome host range barriers. This knowledge will identify targets and intervention strategies to manipulate the different anti-infective host responses and to develop new drugs and vaccines. Our increased understanding of the molecular properties of viruses underpins the development of control strategies and techniques that hold future promise both for the rapid development of vaccines and for resolving the issues concerning pathogenesis and transmissibility. In this Perspective, we have discussed interspecies transmission only from the perspective of the viral pathogen and have not considered the key issues of susceptibility and the immune status of the host. It must be remembered that the molecular basis of interspecies transmission constitutes a complex interaction between virus and host and between the genomics of both.",

Although the primary reservoir of influenza A viruses is the aquatic birds of the world, stable lineages are present in other hosts such as humans. Analysis of the receptor-binding preferences of viruses from each of these hosts has shown that human and avian viruses have preferences for different conformations of the cellular receptor, sialic acid. Because of this, viruses adapted to humans replicate in and transmit well to other humans, but poorly to aquatic birds. Conversely, viruses adapted to aquatic birds replicate in and transmit well to other aquatic birds, but poorly to humans. Swine seem to be unique in terms of influenza A ecology and show an intermediate susceptibility to both human and avian viruses.",
