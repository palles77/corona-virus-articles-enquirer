Methods: Viability, apoptosis and LRP2 level in TPC-1 cells treated with different doses of metformin for different time points were determined. Besides, protein levels of p-JNK1 and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) in metformin-treated TPC-1 cells were detected by Western blot. Regulatory effects of LRP2 on the JNK pathway and cell viability in metformin-treated TPC-1 cells were assessed. Results: Viability in TPC-1 cells gradually decreased with the treatment of increased doses of metformin either for 24 h or 48 h. The apoptotic rate was concentration-dependently elevated by metformin treatment. Relative levels of LRP2 and p-JNK1 were concentrationdependently downregulated by metformin treatment. In addition, overexpression of LRP2 partially abolished the inhibitory effect of metformin on the viability of TPC-1 cells. Conclusion: Metformin treatment suppresses the proliferative ability and induces apoptosis of TPC-1 cells by downregulating LRP2 to block the JNK pathway.",

In recent years, thyroid cancer has been well concerned because of the rapid rise in its incidence. 1 As a first-line drug applied for T2DM (type 2 diabetes mellitus), metformin contributes to stabilize blood glucose levels through inhibiting gluconeogenesis and reducing hepatic glycogenolysis. 2 Interestingly, the application of metformin sharply decreases the incidences of tumor diseases, suppresses the growth of malignant cells and enhances chemotherapy-sensitivity. 3 Therefore, metformin may exert a potential anti-tumor role. It is expected to be an adjuvant drug for the treatment of thyroid cancer.",

Later, the tumor-suppressor effect of metformin has been well concerned. A relevant study demonstrated that metformin treatment suppresses tumor growth, elevates the complete remission rate and prolongs the disease-free survival in patients with thyroid cancer. 14 Cho et al 15 suggested that the application of different doses of metformin reduces the tumor volume and suppresses tumor cell growth in tumor-bearing nude mice. In a recent study, metformin like drug AICAR that affects cancer cell proliferation which in turn effective to create cell death in cancer cells via activating AMPK pathway. 16 In this paper, metformin treatment markedly inhibited proliferative ability and induced apoptosis in TPC-1 cells. Furthermore, LRP2 level was downregulated and the JNK pathway was activated by metformin application.",
