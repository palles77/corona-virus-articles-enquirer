The virus is transmitted via the faecal-oral route, initially replicates in tissues of the oropharynx and is then distributed via a cellfree viraemia to virtually all tissues. The genome of FPV is a single-stranded DNA molecule, which requires cells in the S-phase of division for its replication, and virus growth is therefore restricted to mitotically active tissues. All 'autonomous' parvoviruses require cellular DNA polymerases that synthesise the complementary DNA strand -this is the first step in viral DNA replication and a prerequisite for transcription.",

In most cats, MDA remain at protective titres until 6-8 weeks of age. However, later vaccinations have proven to offer advantages, 23 Since the endo thelio chorial placen tation of the cat restricts materno fetal passage of solutes, immunoglobulins of the IgG isotype can reach the fetus only during the last third of gestation and contribute to less than 10% of the kitten's maternal immunity. Therefore, sufficient colostrum must be ingested to acquire protective levels of neutralising antibodies from the queen. Maximum absorption occurs around the eighth hour of life. Later, the kitten's intestinal cells are replaced by epithelium that can no longer absorb and transport antibodies. Kitten serum antibody titres generally approach 50% of those of the dam, but vary depending on individual colostrum intake -which explains the large variations between littermates. 24 Titres decrease in the first weeks of life by decay and dilution in the growing kitten. By analogy with CPV, an immunity gap around 8-12 weeks of age is postulated, when antibody levels are too low to protect against natural infection, but still high enough to interfere with vaccination ( Fig 4) . 22 ",

Feline leukaemia virusinfected cats should be vaccinated against FPV. Although there is no evidence that they are at an increased risk of vaccineinduced disease from MLV vaccines, inactivated preparations are preferred. Cats infected with FeLV may not mount satisfactory immune responses to rabies vaccines, and perhaps to other vaccine antigens. Therefore, more frequent vaccinations should be considered. \u271c Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) positive cats Healthy FIV-infected cats are capable of mounting immune responses to administered antigens (this is not the case during the terminal phase of infection) but primary immune responses may be delayed or diminished [EBM grade III]. 58-60 In one study, cats experimentally infected with FIV developed vaccine-induced panleukopenia when given MLV FPV vaccines [EBM grade III].61 Immune stimulation of FIV-infected lymphocytes in vitro promotes virus production, and stimulation of chronically FIV-infected cats with a synthetic peptide was associated with a decrease in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio.62,59 Therefore, a potential trade-off to protection from, from example, panleukopenia is the progression of the FIV infection due to increased virus production [EBM grade III]. This means that only FIV-seropositive cats at high risk of exposure should be vaccinated, and only using killed vaccines. donors must be screened for insidious infections (particularly with feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukaemia virus and Bartonella species). Careful attention should be paid to sterility during collection, serum preparation, storage and administration. The area over the jugular vein should be shaved and disinfected for aseptic venepuncture. Blood should be collected (at least double the volume of serum required) into sterile tubes without additives. Serum can be stored at -20\u00b0C in single dose aliquots, as IgG is stable and can be kept for a year if frozen promptly after collection [EBM grade II].55",
