            "text": "Introduction: There is little research on emergency care delivery in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). To facilitate future research, we aimed to assess the set of key metrics currently used by researchers in these settings and to propose a set of standard metrics to facilitate future research. Methods: Systematic literature review of 43,109 published reports on general emergency care from 139 LMICs. Studies describing care for subsets of emergency conditions, subsets of populations, and data aggregated across multiple facilities were excluded. All facility-and patient-level statistics reported in these studies were recorded and the most commonly used metrics were identified. Results: We identified 195 studies on emergency care delivery in LMICs. There was little uniformity in either patient-or facility-level metrics reported. Patient demographics were inconsistently reported: only 33% noted average age and 63% the gender breakdown. The upper age boundary used for paediatric data varied widely, from 5 to 20 years of age. Emergency centre capacity was reported using a variety of metrics including annual patient volume (n = 175, 90%); bed count (n = 60, 31%), number of rooms (n = 48, 25%); frequently none of these metrics were reported (n = 16, 8%). Many characteristics essential to describe capabilities and performance of emergency care were not reported, including use and type of triage; level of provider training; admission rate; time to evaluation; and length of EC stay. Conclusion: We found considerable heterogeneity in reporting practices for studies of emergency care in LMICs. Standardised metrics could facilitate future analysis and interpretation of such studies, and expand the ability to generalise and compare findings across emergency care settings. Introduction: Peu d'e\u00b4tudes ont e\u00b4te\u00b4re\u00b4alise\u00b4es sur la fourniture de soins d'urgence dans les pays a`faible et moyen revenus (PFMR). Pour faciliter les futures e\u00b4tudes, nous avons cherche\u00b4a`e\u00b4valuer l'ensemble de mesures cle\u00b4s actuellement utilise\u00b4es par les chercheurs dans ces contextes, et a`proposer un ensemble de mesures standard afin de faciliter les futures e\u00b4tudes. Me\u00b4thodes: Une analyse bibliographique syste\u00b4matique de 43 109 rapports publie\u00b4s sur les soins d'urgence ge\u00b4ne\u00b4raux provenant de 139 PFMR a e\u00b4te\u00b4re\u00b4alise\u00b4e. Les e\u00b4tudes de\u00b4crivant les soins pour des sous-ensembles de conditions urgentes, des sous-ensembles de populations, et des donne\u00b4es agre\u00b4ge\u00b4es issues de plusieurs structures ont e\u00b4te\u00e9 xclues. Toutes les statistiques au niveau des structures et des patients rapporte\u00b4es dans ces e\u00b4tudes ont e\u00b4te\u00b4enregistre\u00b4es et les mesures les plus couramment utilise\u00b4es ont e\u00b4te\u00ed dentifie\u00b4es. Re\u00b4sultats: Nous avons identifie\u00b4195 e\u00b4tudes sur la fourniture de soins d'urgence dans les PFMR. Une faible uniformite\u00b4a e\u00b4te\u00b4observe\u00b4e dans les mesures rapporte\u00b4es, que ce soit au niveau des patients ou des structures. Les donne\u00b4es de\u00b4mographiques relatives aux patients ont e\u00b4te\u00b4rapporte\u00b4es de manie`re irre\u00b4gulie`re: seulement 33% indiquaient l'a\u02c6ge moyen et 63% la re\u00b4partition hommes/femmes. La limite d'a\u02c6ge supe\u00b4rieure utilise\u00b4e pour les donne\u00b4es pe\u00b4diatriques variait dans une large mesure, allant de 5 a`20 ans. La capacite\u00b4des centres d'urgence a e\u00b4te\u00b4rapporte\u00b4e en utilisant un vaste e\u00b4ventail de mesures et notamment le volume annuel de patients (n = 175, 90%); nombre de lits (n = 60, 31%), nombre de chambres (n = 48, 25%); souvent, aucune de ces mesures n'e\u00b4tait rapporte\u00b4e (n = 16, 8%). De nombreuses caracte\u00b4ristiques essentielles pour de\u00b4crire les capacite\u00b4s et la performance des soins d'urgence n'e\u00b4taient pas rapporte\u00b4es, et notamment l'utilisation des me\u00b4thodes de triage et leur type, le niveau de formation des prestataires, le taux d'admission, le temps e\u00b4coule\u00b4avant qu'une e\u00b4valuation soit faite et la dure\u00b4e du se\u00b4jour aux urgences. Conclusion: Nous avons observe\u00b4une he\u00b4te\u00b4roge\u00b4ne\u00b4ite\u00b4conside\u00b4rable dans les pratiques de compte-rendu relatives aux e\u00b4tudes portant sur les soins d'urgence dans les PMFR. Des mesures standardise\u00b4es pourraient faciliter l'analyse et l'interpre\u00b4tation futures de telles e\u00b4tudes, et ame\u00b4liorer la capacite\u00b4a`ge\u00b4ne\u00b4raliser et a`comparer les conclusions entre les diffe\u00b4rents contextes de soins d'urgence.",

            "text": "Emergency medicine plays an integral role in many health systems around the world, primarily in high-income countries. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] There is mounting evidence that high-quality emergency care has the potential to address a significant proportion of the global burden of disease, as advocates have called for the development of emergency care in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Recent outbreaks of pandemic infectious diseases such as MERS-CoV in the Middle East and Asia, and Ebola in West Africa highlighted the need for equipped emergency care facilities, staffed with trained personnel to stem the tide of such outbreaks and to form the front lines in the treatment of more common but increasingly important conditions such as non-communicable disease (NCDs) and injuries in LMICs. 17 Despite the compelling need for more data on emergency care in LMICs, research in this area has been largely neglected. A 2015 systematic review of emergency facilities in LMICs found no published reports on emergency care in over half of LMICs. 18 Where data were available, the review found that only a small set of metrics on emergency care delivery was reported consistently across facilities, and that researchers frequently used a wide array of ill-defined measures to describe EC characteristics and performance. This inconsistency has complicated inter-facility data comparison and study replication. 16, 19 More data are needed to understand current capabilities, expose deficits, and ultimately improve emergency care delivery in these resource-constrained settings. 10, 16, [18] [19] [20] In this study, we identify a set of key metrics commonly used by researchers to describe emergency care in LMICs and propose a standard set of data elements that would be practical to collect. A consensus on basic terminology and methodology has advanced the field of emergency medicine in high-income countries, and a clearly defined core set of metrics for describing emergency care in LMICs would similarly not only advance local emergency care research and quality improvement, but also allow for more effective cross pollination and systems development.",

For example, inpatient beds (10%) and total outpatient visits per year (5%) were underreported. Metrics obtained directly from within the footprint of the EC were reported more reliably, for example annual EC patient volume (90%) was consistently reported as a measure of EC capacity. Similarly, patient events that occur outside the EC are infrequently reported in publications of emergency care in LMICs. Rates of 48 h mortality (10%) and need for subspecialty care (10%) had low-rates of reporting possibly because they do not occur within the patient's EC stay, while data such as type of population served (90%) and gender (63%) are both readily obtained during the EC stay itself and thus more frequently reported. It is instructive to note that studies were 3-4\u00c2 as likely to report important metrics like patient mortality in the EC, compared to reporting that required follow up of patients after disposition to the inpatient service. This may be the result of weaknesses in hospital-wide health information systems in most facilities in LMICs, resulting in inability to consistently capture data on these events as part of the emergency care data recorded. Finally, the rate of patients ''brought-in-dead\" was only reported 7% of the time-this complicates interpretation of in-EC mortality rates, since some hospitals may report these patients as having died in the EC. This raises questions regarding the consistency of definitions used for these categories and the lack of transparency in the practices regarding reporting mortality statistics in these facilities.",

First, patient triage is an indispensable first step to high quality emergency care; yet, it was only referenced in approximately one quarter of reports from LMICs. Even fewer publications provided details on triage processes, which are likely to be variable 33,34 ; indeed, several studies have demonstrated a significant improvement in patient outcomes after the implementation of structured triage. 21, 22, 35 Second, the training level for physicians staffing the facility was noted in approximately half of reports. Lack of senior level supervision of physicians in training has been linked to worse patient outcomes, [36] [37] [38] Reporting the level of training of physicians and nurses staffing facilities in LMICs is essential to understanding the capabilities to provide various services and for accurately mapping the human resource gaps. 39 Other statistics reported in the literature used non-uniform parameters, which made it difficult to aggregate data across facilities. For example, the reporting of in-EC mortality rate was the most frequent measure of death; however, the majority of studies failed to also report patient lengths of stay. When lengths of stays were available, the atypical ranges -up to 117 days in a facility in Brazil 40 -and failure to report means and medians for the data made it difficult to compare emergency care across facilities. This heterogeneity in reporting such a critical data element reinforces the importance of having a standard metric for death, such as 24-h mortality.",

Researchers are bound by the constraints of previously collected administrative data, and lack the tools to initiate prospective data collection in order to answer clinical questions regarding the emergent and life-saving care they provide for their patients. Our goals are to increase the scope of publications from LMICs; facilitate data collection and analysis; improve the ability to translate findings of LMIC emergency care research to other similar settings; gain a better understanding of the burden of disease; and potentially improve patient outcomes by reducing the barriers to clinical research. To do so, we provide a framework for reporting results of emergency care research that is simple to use and which has been tailored to resource-constrained settings in LMICs.",

Report mean, median, and range of patient ages When stratifying patient data by age (demographic information, burden of disease data, and patient outcomes) we recommend using paediatric-adult age cut-off of 15 years of age Within the paediatric age group, patients 5 years of age or less may also be grouped separately (continued on next page) tion of collaborative research networks, and valuable insights can result from analysis of aggregated emergency care data these network produce. Such shared methodology will result in a rapidly growing body of literature capable of painting a clearer picture of the current state of emergency care to inform policymaker decisions. We urge all emergency care researchers in LMICs to adopt such practices to facilitate the growth of such collaborations to help produce the evidence needed to combat the growing global burden of emergency conditions. Our review aimed to identify all published emergency care literature originating from LMICs; however, our search strategy may have neglected reports that used alternative terminology to signify acute care medicine delivery without using the word stem 'emerg-' in the title, keywords, or abstract of articles. The overall paucity of studies that met our inclusion criteria remains our biggest limitation. Our goal during data collection was to record all reported data elements, but the overall infrequency of reporting outside of a few metrics, such as patient volume and demographics, limited the power to draw accurate conclusions from our results. We also acknowledge that the limited data available to researchers, likely related to the overall use of retrospective data collection relying on existing administrative records, is an overarching limitation to this research process, and one that our recommendations aim to change.",

Proportion of emergency patients admitted to the inpatient service from the EC Mortality rate over a time interval, i.e., 24-h mortality rate Number of deaths over the total number of visits to the emergency facility over a time interval from presentation is the preferred metric for death, and this requires patient follow up even after they leave the EC Mortality rate in the emergency facility Number of patients that died in the EC over the total number of visits with simultaneous reporting of the mean, median, and range for patient length of stay in the facility Patients brought-in-dead Number of patients that died BEFORE receiving any treatment in EC To be reported separately from deaths that occur during or after treatment in the EC",
