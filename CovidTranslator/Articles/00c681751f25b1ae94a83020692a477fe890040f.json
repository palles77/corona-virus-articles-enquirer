In this paper, full-length MHC IIA cDNA was isolated from swamp eel (Monopterus albus) by rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR. The genomic structure, molecular polymorphism, tissue distribution, and immune response of the MHC IIA gene to bacterial challenge were investigated. The full-length cDNA (GenBank accession No.: KC616308) is 1,509 bp in length including an 83 bp-long 5' untranslated region (UTR) and a 709 bp-long 3' UTR, which encoded a 238 amino acids protein. In the 2,339 bp-long MHC IIA genomic DNA, four exons and three introns were identified. Sequence comparison exhibited that the deduced amino acid sequence shared 27.1-66.3% identity with those of other species. Seven alleles were identified from five healthy individuals. Number of alleles per individual diversified from two to five. Five different 5' UTR sequences and two different 3' UTR sequences from one individual may infer the existence of five loci at least. Real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated that swamp eel MHC IIA transcripts were ubiquitously expressed in ten tissues, but the expression level was distinctly different. Significant changes were observed in liver, spleen, kidney and intestine after challenged with pathogenic bacteria Aeromonas hydrophilia.",

The predominant function of these genes is to present foreign peptides derived from extracellular pathogens to helper CD4 + T cells (Srisapoome et al. 2004) . MHC class II proteins are heterodimers, composed of two peptides (\u03b1 and \u03b2 chains). The \u03b1-1 and \u03b2-1 domains of the two chains form the peptide-binding region, which facilitates the T lymphocyte-mediated immune recognition of pathogens (Evans et al. 2009 ). Unlike mammals and other vertebrates, MHC class I and class II genes have been found to reside on different linkage groups in teleosts (Sato et al. 2000) .",

The high polymorphism seen in MHC class I genes is commonly confined to exon 2 and exon 3, whereas the polymorphism found in class II genes is centralized in exon 2 (Zhang & Chen 2006a; Xu et al. 2011 ). These regions also contain a number of putative peptide-binding region sites.

Aeromonas hydrophila is one kind of important pathogen of bacterial hemorrhagic septicemia of swamp eel, which could cause great loss of eel production (Chen & Lu 1991) . The swamp eel cultivation has been seriously threatened by A. hydrophila bacteria infection in recent years (Hu et al. 2012; Xu et al. 2013) . The use of antibiotics has partially solved the problem of bacterial disease, but has raised concerns regarding antibiotic residues in fish, environmental pollution, and antibiotic resistance development. The better choices include the use of vaccines or breeding disease-resistant stock. Hence, it is a potential approach to culture strains of fish with enhanced resistance to bacterial disease via marker-assisted selection. Thus, cloning and polymorphism analysis of MHC genes of swamp eel are very important.",

Randomly, 12-15 recombinant clones from each individual was sequenced and 69 sequences were obtained. Two, three, three, four and five different cDNA sequences were identified from five individuals, respectively. Seven different cDNA sequences encoded seven different internal amino acid sequences. These sequences were designated as moal-DAA*0101-0301, respectively (Fig. 2) . No frame-shift mutation was observed in these sequences. There were between two and five alleles per individual. The presence of five alleles in an individual suggested that there were at least three MHC IIA loci in the genome. In addition, fifteen a b clones of 3' UTR and 5' UTR sequences from the same individual were sequenced. Five different 5' UTR sequences and two different 3' UTR sequences were identified, which further suggested that swamp eel seems to express up to five class IIA loci at least. All the five 5' UTR sequences contain the same 8-bp leader fragment \"ACATGGGG\" (Fig. 3a) . In addition, compared to the first type 3' UTR sequence, a total of 70-bp deletion was found existing in the second type 3'UTR sequence (Fig. 3b) . Further analysis showed that the proportion of variable sites for nucleotide and amino acid sequences across the seven alleles were 21.5% (154/717) and 16.4% (39/238), respectively.",

Alignment analysis showed that the MHC IIA gene shares high degree of similarity to that of other vertebrates. In addition, many specific structural features, such as one N-linked glycosylation site, one protein kinase C phosphorylation site, and three casein kinase II phosphorylation sites were well conserved in the swamp eel MHC IIA and other vertebrates (Srisapoome et al. 2004; Xu et al. 2009; Pang et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2013) . The presence of four conserved cysteine residues and a 'GXXXGXXGXXXG' sequence are also consistent with previous findings in other teleosts and humans. All these results strongly suggest that swamp eel MHC class IIA gene was a novel member of the MHC superfamily.",

According to the previous studies (Chen et al. 2006; Xu et al. 2009; Li et al. 2011; Pang et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2013 ) MHC genes have been characterized by the high degree of polymorphism in vertebrates. In the present study, seven alleles were isolated from five swamp eels. Numbers of alleles per individual varied from 2 to 5. Further analysis showed that five different 5' UTR sequences and two different 3' UTR sequences could also be found from a single individual, implying the existence of five loci at least. Different class IIA numbers have been also found in other fish species, such as two loci have been identified in both half-smooth tongue sole (Xu et al. 2009 ) and spotted halibut (Li et al. 2011 ). More than four MHC IIA alleles were identified in a single individual suggested the existence of at least four loci in Nile tilapia (Pang et al. 2013) .",

These results imply that low levels of expression of MHC class IIA in muscle may be universal in teleosts. The presence of MHC class II mRNA in all tissues could be a result of contamination from leukocytes because it can be difficult to eliminate contaminated leukocytes of the blood in tissues (Srisapoome et al. 2004) .

(2013) found that the mRNA expression levels of Nile tilapia MHC IIB was significantly regulated after A. hydrophila challenge. The results showed that the mRNA levels seemed unchanged in the intestine and spleen after 96 h post-induction. However, challenge with A. hydrophila resulted in a down-regulation in 48 h after infection in the liver and gill, followed by a recovery. In the kidney, there was a significant decrease from 24 h to 72 h after infection.",

In liver, the expression level of MHC IIA gene sustained decreased from infection starting time to 72 h after challenge. In intestine, the expression level of MHC IIA transcripts was initially up-regulated and then decreased acutely, following by a recovery to normal level and a marked increase. However, in spleen and kidney, expression levels of MHC genes were found first up-regulated and then downregulated. These results imply that the MHC IIA genes may be related to the immune response to the bacterial stimulation in swamp eels. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the precise role and mechanism of MHC II in defence response in fish.",
