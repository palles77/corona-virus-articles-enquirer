We then infected HMEC-1 with the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) and found that adhesion of Lm to host cells increases monotonically with increasing matrix stiffness, an effect that requires the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified cell surface vimentin as a candidate surface receptor mediating stiffness-dependent adhesion of Lm to HMEC-1 and found that bacterial infection of these host cells is decreased when the amount of surface vimentin is reduced. Our results provide the first evidence that ECM stiffness can mediate the susceptibility of mammalian host cells to infection by a bacterial pathogen.",

One such agent is the food-borne facultative bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). After initial invasion of the intestinal epithelium, Lm is able to spread through the vasculature to distant organs, and can cause serious complications such as meningitis and late-term spontaneous abortion by virtue of its unusual ability to penetrate and cross a wide variety of endothelial barriers, including the blood-brain barrier and the placenta (Vazquez-Boland et al., 2001; Jackson et al., 2010) . Lm has a broad range of susceptible host animals and uses multiple pathogenic strategies to achieve infection of a wide variety of tissues within each host. It can directly adhere to and invade intestinal epithelial cells and hepatocytes using bacterial surface proteins belonging to the internalin family, such as InlA, InlB, and InlF, which interact with host cell surface receptors Shen et al., 2000; Kirchner and Higgins, 2008) . Lm can also directly adhere to and invade the vascular endothelial cells (VECs) that line the inner lumen of blood vessels, using several distinct molecular mechanisms that may vary depending on the subtype of VEC being infected (Drevets et al., 1995; Greiffenberg et al., 1997 Greiffenberg et al., , 1998 Parida et al., 1998; Wilson and Drevets, 1998; Rengarajan et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "Vascular endothelial cells (VECs) are known to be highly mechanosensitive. The stiffness of the ECM surrounding blood vessels can vary significantly in space (location within the vascular tree), in time (aging), and with pathophysiological conditions (e.g., arteriosclerosis, cancer; Volkman et al., 2002; Chien et al., 2005; Krishnan et al., 2011; Yeh et al., 2012; Collins et al., 2014) . These variations in stiffness can dramatically affect the gene expression and barrier integrity of VECs, thereby regulating the movement of vascular components from the bloodstream into underlying tissues, including the dissemination of bacterial pathogens (Lemichez et al., 2010) . Clinical studies have shown that the local compliance of the basement membrane of VECs in the brain tissue is as soft as 1 kPa, while bigger vessels such as the aorta are as stiff as 20 kPa (Wells, 2008; Wood et al., 2010; Janmey and Miller, 2011; Onken et al., 2014; Kohn et al., 2015) , and their stiffness can increase up to 70 kPa due to aging (Huynh et al., 2011) and in the context of cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis or hypertension (Blacher et al., 1999; Boutouyrie et al., 2002) . VECs, like other adherent cell types, probe features of their environment, including its stiffness, through integrins, transmembrane receptors that allow attachment of the cells to their matrix through direct binding to ECM ligand proteins (Senger et al., 2002; Schwartz, 2010) . Integrin binding to the ECM leads to recruitment of additional proteins and to formation of focal adhesions that in turn relay information to the actin cytoskeleton and to various signaling molecules, modulating cellular adhesion, shape, contractility, gene expression, and fate in general (Pelham and Wang, 1997) . Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that has been established as a key component of the signal transduction pathways triggered by integrins. The expression and/or activity of FAK is dependent on ECM rigidity, showing decreased expression and/or activation on softer matrices for certain cell types and can influence cell adhesion and motility (Khatiwala et al., 2006; Provenzano et al., 2009; Higuita-Castro et al., 2014; Du et al., 2016) . However, no studies have previously addressed whether and how VEC matrix stiffness sensing through focal adhesions might affect host cells' interactions with bacterial pathogens.",

Vimentin is generally an intracellular cytoskeletal protein that forms intermediate filaments in many mesoderm-derived cells (Clarke and Allan, 2002) . Vimentin can also be localized on the surfaces of cells for a variety of cell types, although the precise mechanism by which vimentin is delivered there is not yet fully understood (Mor-Vaknin et al., 2003; P\u00e4ll et al., 2011; Rohrbeck et al., 2014; Mitra et al., 2015; Shigyo et al., 2015) . Recent studies have shown that various bacteria, as well as viruses, use surface vimentin as an attachment receptor to facilitate entry into host cells (Garg et al., 2006; Zou et al., 2006; Bhattacharya et al., 2009; Du et al., 2014; Rohrbeck et al., 2014; Mak and Br\u00fcggemann, 2016; Yang et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2016; Ghosh et al., 2018) . However, little is known about what modulates the amount of vimentin exposed on the surface of cells and whether regulation of its surface presentation potentially mediates bacterial uptake.",

Subendothelial stiffness depends on the blood vessel's location within the body, on the size of the vessel, on age, and on physiological or pathophysiological conditions, and so we chose our substrates' stiffness to span a wide range of stiffnesses, from 0.6 to 70 kPa (Stroka and Aranda-Espinoza, 2011; Kohn et al., 2015) . We found a twofold increase in bacterial adhesion when cells reside on stiff rather than soft matrices. We also found that Tyr397 phosphorylation of FAK was higher for VECs residing on stiff matrices, and furthermore that knockdown of FAK or treatment of VECs with FAK inhibitors lead to a decrease in bacterial infection. When we searched for candidate VEC surface receptors differentially modulated depending on FAK activity, we identified surface vimentin as a candidate and found that decreasing the amount or the accessibility of host cell-surface vimentin leads to a concomitant decrease in Lm infection. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that environmental stiffness of VECs, a previously unappreciated factor, plays an important role in mediating infection susceptibility to Lm through differential activity of FAK, which in turn affects the amount of surface vimentin.",

To be able to recapitulate in vivo conditions and determine in a systematic way the effect of the VECs' matrix stiffness on the efficiency of Lm infection, we developed an assay based on manufacturing thin polyacrylamide hydrogels of varying stiffness ranging from 0.6 to 70 kPa on multiwell glass-bottom plates (Georges et al., 2006; Mih et al., 2011; Ahmed, 2015) (Supplemental Figure S1A ). To enable cell adhesion, hydrogels were surface-coated with collagen I, using a consistent density of collagen independent of hydrogel stiffness, as reported in previous studies (Yeung et al., 2005; Tse and Engler, 2010; Huang et al., 2013) . Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) seeded for 24 h on the hydrogels formed monolayers with comparable densities regardless of substrate stiffness, similar to growth of these cells on TC polystyrene (Supplemental Figure S1B ).",

In that way, we could attribute changes in the number of infected cells directly to initial invasion events and not to spread of the bacteria from cell to cell. We also confirmed that adhesion and invasion of wild-type Lm into HMEC-1 is similar to that of \u0394actA Lm, consistent with previous studies on other host cell types (Kocks et al., 1992; Brundage et al., 1993) , suggesting that ActA is not involved in adhesion or invasion (Supplemental Figure S1 , D-F). The \u0394actA Lm strain we used also expresses a fluorescent protein under a promoter that is activated several hours after exposure of the bacteria to the host cell cytosol (actAp::mTagRFP; Zeldovich et al., 2011) , allowing reliable fluorescence-based detection of only the bacteria that have successfully invaded the host cells. We determined the fraction of HMEC-1 infected with Lm in each well using flow cytometry (Figure 1, A-D) . At a constant multiplicity of infection (MOI) and constant host cell density, we found a monotonic increase (strictly increasing relationship) in the number of VECs infected by Lm with increasing hydrogel stiffness that was highly reproducible among biological replicates ( Figure 1E ; Supplemental Figure S1C ). The overall efficiency of infection on the stiffest hydrogel substrates tested, 70 kPa, was comparable to the efficiency of infection for the same cells grown on TC polystyrene, suggesting that above a certain level of stiffness the infection efficiency does not change (Supplemental Figure S1C ). Compared with this maximum level of infection for HMEC-1 cultured on the stiffest substrates, infection efficiency on the softest substrates decreased about twofold ( Figure  1E ; Supplemental Figure S1C ).",

We therefore sought to determine whether FAK expression or activity could be modulated depending on the substrate stiffness where HMEC-1 reside. To that end, HMEC-1 were grown on soft 3-kPa hydrogels, stiff 70-kPa hydrogels, and TC polystyrene substrates treated with vehicle control or PF573228 FAK inhibitor. Cells were then harvested and total amounts of FAK and pY397-FAK were determined using Western blot analysis. We found that increasing the stiffness of the underlying substrate from 3 to 70 kPa resulted in increasing levels of pY397-FAK, but the levels of total FAK remained largely unchanged (Figure 2 , A-C). In addition, the levels of pFAK-Y397 were similar for cells residing on stiff 70-kPa hydrogels and TC polystyrene substrates (Figure 2 , A-C). Treating cells residing on polystyrene with the specific FAK inhibitor PF573228 led to a significant decrease of pY397-FAK, while total FAK levels remained unchanged as compared with FIGURE 1: Uptake of Lm by HMEC-1 depends on the stiffness of the matrix on which cells reside. HMEC-1 residing on PA hydrogels of varying stiffness coated with collagen I were infected with \u0394actA Lm (actAp::mTagRFP). Infection was analyzed by flow cytometry 7-8 h postinfection. Bacteria were added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) between 30 and 50 bacteria per host cell.

We then measured the efficiency of infection with Lm as described above, and found that both FAK inhibitors caused a similar dose-dependent inhibition of Lm infection ( Figure 2D ). We then transfected HMEC-1 with commercial nontargeting control small interfering RNA (siRNA) (siNT) or siRNA-targeting FAK (siFAK) (Supplemental Table S2 ), and total FAK expression was found to be about fivefold reduced for the FAK knockdown cells as compared with controls, as determined by immunofluorescence (Supplemental Figure S2A ) and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Supplemental Figure S2B ). We found a significant, approximately twofold decrease in Lm infection efficiency for the FAK knockdown cells as compared with control cells ( Figure 2E ; Supplemental Figure S2 , C and D). Taken together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that decreased bacterial infection of HMEC-1 residing on highly compliant soft matrices may be due in part to decreased FAK activity.",

            "text": "To address whether elevating FAK activity can lead to increased bacterial uptake, we pretreated cells for various times with the vasoconstrictor peptide hormone Angiotensin II, which has been shown to induce an increase in phosphorylation of FAK in vivo in murine aortas (Louis et al., 2007) and also shown in vitro to lead to enhanced phosphorylation of FAK at Y397 for a variety of cell types (Greco et al., 2002; Weng and Shukla, 2002; Torsoni et al., 2005) , including endothelial cells (Montiel et al., 2005) . We first treated HMEC-1 with 100 nM Angiotensin II for various times and then lysed the cells and used Western blotting to assess FAK expression and phosphorylation of FAK at Y397 ( Figure 2F ; Supplemental Figure  S2F ). Interestingly, we found that, although FAK expression did not change upon treatment with Angiotensin II, phosphorylation of FAK at Y397 increased substantially for cells treated with Angiotensin II for more than 30 min. Because FAK activity was shown to be elevated for cells pretreated for more than 30 min with Angiotensin II, we then asked whether that would be sufficient to lead to increased infection susceptibility. When we infected HMEC-1 cells seeded on polystyrene substrates and pretreated with 100 nM of Angiotensin II, we observed a modest but significant 23% increase in infection susceptibility as compared with control cells ( Figure 2G ; Supplemental Figure S2E ). We then seeded HMEC-1 cells on soft 3-kPa and stiff 70-kPa hydrogels and pretreated cells with or without 100 nM Angiotensin II for 2 h. We found a much stronger effect of Angiotensin II increasing infection for cells plated on soft substrates than on stiff substrates; indeed, treatment of cells on 3-kPa substrates with 100 nM Angiotensin II for 2 h was sufficient to raise the level of infection to be approximately equal to infection on 70-kPa substrates (Supplemental Figure S2G ). This result further supports the hypothesis that a primary determinant of the relatively inefficient infection of HMEC-1 on soft substrates is the relatively low level of FAK activity under this environmental condition.",

To help identify the exact step in infection that is sensitive to substrate stiffness, we used a constitutively GFP-expressing strain of Lm to infect HMEC-1 residing on either soft 3-kPa or stiff 70-kPa hydrogels and treated with vehicle control or PF573228. Samples were fixed shortly after infection, and bacteria that were attached to the cell surface but not yet internalized were specifically labeled with antibodies under nonpermeabilizing conditions. This inside/outside labeling method allows us to distinguish between bacteria that are adhered but not internalized (GFP-positive and labeled with the antibody) and those that are fully internalized by the HMEC-1 (GFP-positive but not labeled with the antibody). We found that both the total number of bacteria per host cell and the number of internalized bacteria per cell are significantly increased when HMEC-1 reside on stiff 70-kPa hydrogels as compared with soft 3-kPa hydrogels (Figure 3 , A and B). However, importantly, the invasion efficiency (ratio of internalized bacteria to total bacteria) did not differ between HMEC-1 residing on stiff as compared with soft matrices, suggesting that it is specifically the adhesion of bacteria to the surface of host cells that is increased when the matrix stiffness is elevated and that leads to increased Lm infection efficiency for cells residing on stiffer matrices ( Figure 3C ). Interestingly, we found a decrease in both Lm adhesion and invasion efficiency irrespective of hydrogel stiffness for the cells treated with the FAK inhibitor ( Figure 3 ), suggesting that FAK activity levels modulate both adhesion and invasion efficiency of Lm in HMEC-1, while substrate stiffness affects adhesion only.",

We found a twofold decrease in bacterial infection when InlB was not present, suggesting that InlB is one of possibly multiple bacterial factors that contribute to Lm infection of HMEC-1. In contrast to the effect of the deletion in the inlB gene, deletion of inlF had no effect on bacterial infection of HMEC-1. Deletion of inlA resulted in very modest but reproducible reduction in infection, as reported previously for human brain microvascular endothelial cells infected with Lm (Greiffenberg et al., 1998) .",

Consistent with our previous findings, we observed a twofold decrease in bacterial uptake for a series of different multiplicities of infection (MOI) when inlB was knocked out ( Figure 4B ). Importantly, bacteria carrying a deletion of inlB still exhibited a strong monotonic dependence of infection efficiency on substrate stiffness ( Figure 4C ).

            "text": "We confirmed this conclusion using four different lines of experimentation. First, we directly assessed the effect of inlB deletion on bacterial adhesion and invasion of HMEC-1 using inside/outside labeling as described above. We found that the total number of bacteria associated with HMEC-1 cells was the same for wild-type bacteria as for an isogenic \u0394inlB strain ( Figure 4D ); that is, adhesion to the host cell surface is indeed unchanged. However, the number of internalized bacteria per cell and therefore the overall invasion efficiency was significantly decreased for the \u0394inlB strain ( Figure  4 , E and F). Second, we examined the effect of inhibiting the host cell binding partner for InlB, the receptor tyrosine kinase Met (also known as the hepatocyte growth factor receptor), on bacterial invasion. We confirmed that HMEC-1 express Met (Supplemental Figure S3A ) and then treated the cells with various concentrations of the highly selective Met inhibitor SGX-523 prior to infection (Buchanan et al., 2009) . We found that only uptake of the control \u0394actA strain of Lm decreased with increasing concentration of SGX-523, while uptake of the isogenic \u0394actA/\u0394inlB Lm did not change substantially as a function of SGX-523 concentration ( Figure 4G ). Third, when we then transfected HMEC-1 with commercial nontargeting control siRNA (siNT) or siRNA targeting Met (siMet) and then infected HMEC-1 with Lm, we found a significant twofold decrease in Lm infection efficiency for the Met knockdown cells as compared with control cells ( Figure 4H ; Supplemental Figure S3 , B and C), while confirming that Met expression was fivefold reduced for the Met knockdown cells as compared with controls through RT-PCR (Supplemental Figure S3D ; Supplemental Table S2 ). When we then infected transfected siNT and siMet HMEC-1 with \u0394actA/\u0394inlB Lm, we found no significant difference in infection Lm uptake between the two conditions, consistent with the previous results of cells pretreated or not with SGX-523 ( Figure 4G ; Supplemental Figure S3E ). These results confirm that InlB most likely contributes to Lm invasion into HMEC-1 by interacting with host Met, as has been shown for other cell types (Parida et al., 1998; Bierne and Cossart, 2002) . However, Lm invasion into HMEC-1 treated with SGX-523 still retains a strong dependence on substrate stiffness ( Figure 4I ), just as we found for the \u0394inlB strain. Fourth, we found that infection of HMEC-1 with the \u0394actA/\u0394inlB strain of Lm is still highly sensitive to inhibition of FAK with PF573228, showing a dose-response curve that parallels that of the control \u0394actA strain ( Figure 4J ).",

The well-characterized InlB-Met interaction appears to contribute to invasion of adherent bacteria into HMEC-1, and is responsible for about half of the invasion efficiency for Lm infecting these cells. However, this interaction does not govern bacterial adhesion per se, is not sensitive to substrate stiffness, and is orthogonal to the FAK signaling axis.

Because manufacturing soft and stiff PA hydrogels with large dimensions is both technically challenging and costly, we instead grew cells on large TC polystyrene plates and treated them with vehicle control or the FAK inhibitor PF573228. We then biotinylated the cell surface-exposed proteins using membrane-impermeable EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and isolated them by affinity chromatography with streptavidin-agarose beads (Fujimoto et al., 1992; Nunomura et al., 2005) . Isolated surface proteins were then run in two-dimensional (2D)-PAGE gels to allow separation of proteins according to both their isoelectric points and their molecular weight (Elia, 2012) . Gels were silver-stained and comparison between gels was performed by marking the spots that differed in intensity ( Figure 5 , A and B). We found a spot at \u223c55 kDa consistently differing in two independent experiments between the control sample and the sample treated with the FAK inhibitor PF573228 (see circles in Figure 5 , A and B). In a third replicate experiment of surface protein isolation, 2D-PAGE gels were Coomassie stained and the specific 55 kDa spot that differed as a function of FAK inhibitor treatment was excised and further analyzed by nanoliquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS). We identified this spot as the protein vimentin (accession number: gi|340219, Mascot identification score: 788, number of identified peptides: 87, mass: 53,752, isoelectric point: 5.05, sequence coverage: 61%). Vimentin is a major component of the cytoskeleton, forming intermediate filaments, but exists also in soluble form and has been previously found to localize at the cell surface for a wide variety of cells including VECs (Fuchs and Weber, 1994; Zou et al., 2006; Du et al., 2014; Mitra et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2016) .",

We then infected the host cells with constitutively GFP-expressing Lm and fixed samples shortly after infection. Through quantitative microscopy, we observed no significant change in infection susceptibility for vimentin knockdown cells blocked with anti-vimentin antibodies prior to infection as compared with vimentin knockdown alone, confirming that the antibodies inhibit uptake was due to effects on vimentin and not to nonspecific effects (Supplemental Figure S4G) . Similarly, when HMEC-1 transfected with siNT or siVIM were pretreated with or without withaferin, we found a significant decrease in bacterial adhesion only for the control cells treated with withaferin and not for the vimentin knockdown cells (Supplemental Figure S4H ). Finally, we hypothesized that if vimentin localizes at cell-cell junctions, and given that perturbing the amount of surface vimentin leads to up to a twofold decrease in infection susceptibility, then we should expect that when HMEC-1 are infected with Lm, half of the bacteria should adhere at cell-cell junctions and half could adhere anywhere else. Indeed, when we infected HMEC-1 with Lm, fixed the samples, and then immunostained for VE-cadherin as a proxy for cell-cell junctions (Supplemental Figure S5A ), we observed that quite often bacteria were found adhering at cell-cell junctions.

When cells were both pretreated with withaferin and infected with \u0394actA/\u0394inlB Lm, infection was decreased fourfold relative to controls ( Figure 7D ); that is, InlB/Met and vimentin contribute independently to infection efficiency.

To gain insight into whether vimentin-based bacterial adhesion is a result of a nonspecific stickiness or a specific host-bacterium interaction, we measured the influence of cell surface vimentin on adhesion of other bacteria and of nonbiological particles. L. innocua (Li) is a bacterium closely related to Lm that is considered nonpathogenic in that it lacks the putative internalin family members and other virulence factors that Lm carries (Glaser et al., 2001; Lauer et al., 2002) . When we infected HMEC-1 with comparable loads of Lm and Li, we found that adhesion of both bacteria is comparable ( Figure 8A ). We also found that treating HMEC-1 with the FAK inhibitor PF537228 or blocking HMEC-1 with the anti-vimentin antibody H-84 reduces adhesion of both Lm and Li onto HMEC-1 by similar amounts ( Figure  8A ). Next, to examine whether a bacterial factor common to Lm and Li could be responsible for surface vimentin-mediated adhesion, we blocked HMEC-1 with anti-vimentin antibody and exposed cells to 2-\u03bcm carboxylated latex beads, which are efficiently taken up by VECs. We found that uptake of beads did not vary with antibody concentration and was identical to uptake of cells treated with isotype control ( Figure 8B ). Our results suggest that cell surface vimentin is a common receptor for both Lm and Li in the context of adhesion to HMEC-1, but uptake of nonbiological particles such as carboxylated latex beads does not depend on surface vimentin.",

Interestingly, many signaling pathways involved in mechanotransduction are common irrespective of the exact mechanical stimulus (Li et al., 1997; Zebda et al., 2012) . For instance, exposure of VECs to shear flow leads to recruitment of FAK at focal adhesions and to an increase in the phosphorylation at Y397 (Li et al., 1997) . Consistent with FAK activity being sensitive to mechanical stimuli, we found that FAK activity is increased when cells reside on stiffer matrices. Concurrently, we observe a decrease in Lm uptake when FAK activity is reduced. It is possible that enhanced FAK activity for VECs exposed to shear stresses, might also lead to increased Lm uptake, but this still remains to be investigated (Li et al., 1997) . In our study, we focused only on the effect of ECM stiffness on host cell infection and did not consider in our model additional mechanical cues that host cells experience (Shi and Tarbell, 2011) . On the basis of our findings and on recent studies on shear flow-exposed VECs infected with pathogens, we speculate that it is plausible that additional mechanical cues could also play an important role in mediating susceptibility to infection, similarly to matrix stiffness (Claes et al., 2014; Niddam et al., 2017) . The development of organotypic models for studying bacterial infection that take into account all of the different in vivo mechanical cues sensed by cells is therefore pertinent.",

            "text": "Our findings suggest that, together with biochemical cues, the ECM stiffness where cells reside is an additional variable worth considering, since it affects cellular behavior and susceptibility to bacterial infection. In traditional studies of bacterial infection of host cells, ECM stiffness is not taken into account, and such studies are typically performed on nonphysiological glass or polystyrene surfaces. Our study on how HMEC-1 interact with Lm at varying subendothelial stiffness was designed with the intent to mimic variations that occur under physiological conditions depending on the anatomic location of the vessel, in aging, and during pathophysiological conditions (Zieman et al., 2005; Acerbi et al., 2015) . Our lower range of subendothelial matrix stiffness (0.6 kPa) could be relevant for the brain microvasculature, where the blood vessel microenvironment is very soft, whereas higher values are more relevant for bigger vessels or aged/diseased vasculature (Klein et al., 2009; Huynh et al., 2011; Stroka and Aranda-Espinoza, 2011; Kothapalli et al., 2012; Kohn et al., 2015) . We showed that subendothelial stiffness changes the amount of surface vimentin expressed by VECs, therefore affecting critically how much host cells are susceptible to bacterial infection. That is, aged or diseased vessels might be more susceptible to infection based on our findings, while VECs lining healthy and softer vessels should be less susceptible to infection by Lm. It is plausible that low stiffness might be a host mechanism to protect against infection. For the purpose of the present study, we just examined how subendothelial stiffness modulates bacterial adhesion on previously uninfected VECs. However, it is very possible that once bacteria infect their hosts they might have developed ways to circumvent such a host mechanism by somehow altering matrix stiffness, that is, by reprogramming host cells to alter their production of ECM proteins or matrix-degrading enzymes, which could lead to alterations in subendothelial stiffness and subsequently VEC biomechanics, critically impacting infection. Future studies should address how host cell biomechanics changes upon infection and how bacterial infection changes the susceptibility of host cells to further infection.",

The role of cell surface vimentin as an attachment receptor facilitating bacterial or viral entry has been documented previously (Garg et al., 2006; Zou et al., 2006; Bhattacharya et al., 2009; Du et al., 2014; Rohrbeck et al., 2014; Mak and Br\u00fcggemann, 2016; Yang et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2016) . We speculate that the matrix stiffness of VECs might possibly also affect uptake of the above pathogens, since the amount of surface vimentin is reduced when FAK activity is decreased, as in the case of cells residing on compliant matrices. Most importantly, our findings corroborate recent findings (Ghosh et al., 2018) showing that vimentin knockout mice show decreased Lm colonization of the brain. This same report also demonstrated that cell surface vimentin can contribute to Lm adhesion to or invasion of several rodent-derived cell lines, including mouse embryonic fibroblasts, mouse endothelial cells, and rat lung epithelial cells, as well as human microvascular endothelial cells, and suggested that the Lm surface protein InlF can serve as a binding partner for vimentin in the rodent model systems.",

In contrast to the findings of Ghosh et al. (2018) , we found that Lm infection of HMEC-1 is independent of InlF. Instead, we demonstrate that a decreased amount of cell surface vimentin leads to decreased adhesion of both pathogenic Lm and its non-pathogenic relative Li on HMEC-1, suggesting that the possible bacterial binding partner of vimentin might be expressed in both bacterial species. Surface vimentin has been shown to possess lectin-like activity binding N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), a sugar that is also commonly found as a component of bacterial cell envelopes (Ise et al., 2010; Konopka, 2012) . Specifically, GlcNAc is found decorating the wall teichoic acids of Lm serotype 1/2a strains, such as the 10403S strain used in this study (Fiedler, 1988) . This implies that bacterial carbohydrate binding to host cell surface vimentin might also be a plausible specific interaction.",

In this work, we investigated the possibility of a receptor at the surfaces of host cells being differentially regulated when FAK activity is increased, as in stiff matrices, and identified cell surface vimentin as a well-supported candidate receptor. However, it is also possible that additional factors might also lead to the decreased adhesion of Lm on HMEC-1 residing on softer matrices. It is plausible that the cell surface glycans of HMEC-1 might be differentially regulated depending on the stiffness of the environment. For example, previous studies have suggested both a positive correlation between FAK activity and the heparan sulfate portion of the glycocalyx (Liu et al., 2002; Gopal et al., 2010) and between the heparan sulfate portion of the glycocalyx and Lm adhesion on enterocytes (Henry-Stanley et al., 2003) .

It has been documented that mechanical and chemical cues relayed to VECs by their environment can alter function and gene expression of VECs found at different tissues (Aird, 2012; Kohn et al., 2015) . However, even when VECs from different origins are placed in vitro in the same environment, they can still exhibit unique behavior intrinsic to the cells themselves and not determined by differential culture or environmental conditions (Craig et al., 1998; Stroka and Aranda-Espinoza, 2011; Ostrowski et al., 2014; Ye et al., 2014) . For example, the response of human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVEC) to changes in curvature or shear stress is completely distinct from that of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC; Ye et al., 2014) . In accordance with the differences these two cell types exhibit in response to geometrical constraints or mechanical stimuli, studies have also shown differences with respect to Lm infection. Past studies suggest that HBMEC infection by Lm depends on InlB (Greiffenberg et al., 1998) , while HUVEC uptake of Lm appears to be independent of both the internalins InlA and InlB (Greiffenberg et al., 1997; Rengarajan et al., 2016) . Similarly, it was recently reported that an interaction between vimentin and InlF contributes to the spatial distribution of Lm adhesion on the surface of a mouse brain endothelial cell line (Ghosh et al., 2018) , whereas we showed that Lm infection of HMEC-1 is independent of InlF. These studies are not necessarily conflicting, but suggest that bacterial infection of VECs depends on both the environment and the particular origin of VECs, and therefore conclusions should refer to the exact cell type and not to endothelial cells in general. Because many pathological processes occur at the microvascular level of organs, we chose in this study to use HMEC-1 as our model for VECs. However, extrapolation from results obtained for HMEC-1 infection by Lm to other VECs should be performed with caution. Similarly, although Lm uptake by HMEC-1 increases with increasing subendothelial stiffness, that relationship could be different if HMEC-1 were infected with different bacterial pathogens. We speculate that the relationship between ECM stiffness and susceptibility to infection is likely host cell-and pathogen-specific.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our results provide the first strong evidence that the local mechanical environment and in particular the matrix stiffness of VECs regulates susceptibility of VECs to Lm infection. The novel mechanosensitive pathway we identified suggests that increased ECM stiffness sensed by VECs leads to enhanced FAK activity that augments the amount of vimentin exposed at the surfaces of VECs. The increased amount of surface vimentin in turn increases Lm adhesion and subsequent uptake by VECs. Our studies on the effect of ECM stiffness on bacterial uptake of VECs can have other significant implications, since they provide an example of how mechanotransduction can be exploited in biology and medicine, At 30 min postinfection, samples were fixed and immunostained and adhesion of bacteria was analyzed by microscopy followed by image processing. For each condition, 2300-2600 cells were analyzed in total and data refer to one of two independent experiments. Two asterisks denote statistically significant differences between the median values of control cells vs. all other groups (<0.01; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). (B) HMEC-1 residing on TC polystyrene substrates and blocked for 1 h with various concentrations of H-84 anti-vimentin antibody or isotype control were \"infected\" with 2 \u03bcm beads at different concentrations. The frequency of microbead uptake by HMEC-1 was determined by flow cytometry 2 h post-addition of beads. Plot shows percentage of cells that internalized beads as a function of the beads/cell added for different H-84 antibody concentrations (mean \u00b1 SD, N = 4 replicates).",

At 20 min postinfection, 1 \u03bcg/ml Hoechst (Thermofisher; D1306) was added in each well to stain the cells' nuclei. At 30 min postinfection, cells were washed four times in PBS and fixed with a nonpermeabilizing fixative for differential immunostaining for 20 min at room temperature (Yam and Theriot, 2004) . Fixative contained 0.32 M sucrose, 10 mM MES at pH 6.1, 138 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA, and 4% formaldehyde of EM grade. Following a wash with PBS, samples were blocked for 30 min with 5% BSA in PBS and then incubated with anti-Lm primary antibody (Abcam ab35132) diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 2% BSA for 1 h. Samples were washed in PBS three times and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen A-11035) diluted 1:250 in PBS containing 2% BSA for 1 h. Samples were washed three times in PBS and stored in 1 ml PBS for imaging. N > 1000 cells were analyzed per condition. For imaging, we used an inverted Nikon Diaphot 200 with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Andor Technologies) and a 40\u00d7 air Plan Fluor NA 0.60 or a 100\u00d7 oil objective. The microscope was controlled by the MicroManager software package (Edelstein et al., 2014) . For differential immunostaining, all \"green\" bacteria associated with individual cells were counted as adherent; bacteria that were both \"green\" and \"red\" (due to antibody binding) were counted as noninternalized. Nuclei number was identified by running a custom-made script in MATLAB (Mathworks), and the CellC software was used for enumeration of the bacteria (Selinummi et al., 2005) . For characterization of total bacteria adhering to host cells (Lm or Li), the same procedure was followed, with the exception that cells were permeabilized for 5 min in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. The primary antibody used was goat polyclonal BacTrace anti-Listeria genus-specific antibody.",

The following parameters were used: background subtraction of polynomial order 5 adaptive with a threshold of 30%, two smoothings with a window of three channels in Savitzky-Golay mode and centroid calculation of top 80% of peaks based on a minimum peak width of four channels at half height. The resulting pkl files were submitted for database search and protein identification to the public Mascot database search (www .matrixscience.com, Matrix Science) using the following parameters: databases from NCBI (bacteria), parent mass error of 1.3 Da, product ion error of 0.8 Da, enzyme used: trypsin, one missed cleavage, propionamide as cysteine-fixed modification, and methionine oxidized as variable modification. To identify falsenegative results, we used additional parameters such as different databases or organisms, a narrower error window for the parent mass error (1.2 and then 0.2 Da) and for the product ion error (0.6 Da), and up to two missed cleavage sites for trypsin. In addition, the pkl files were also searched against in-house PLGS database version 2.4 (www.waters.com) using searching parameters similar to the ones used for the Mascot search. The Mascot and PLGS database search provided a list of proteins for each gel band. To eliminate false positive results, for the proteins identified by either one peptide or a mascot score lower than 25, we verified the MS/MS spectra that led to identification of a protein.",

Temperature was kept at 37\u00b0C throughout the experiment. Tip calibration curves were determined on glass substrate surface, which was considered infinitely hard for the soft tips used. Two approach-withdraw cycles were performed per cell. Data analysis of FD curves and calculation of Young's modulus were performed using XEI software (Park Systems) and SPIP software (Image Metrology, H\u00f8rsholm, Denmark).",

The bold black line parallel to the x-axis indicates the median (second quartile) of the distribution and the boxplot's notched section shows the 95% confidence interval around the median (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney nonparametric test). Regular black lines extended vertically below and above the medians represent the first and third quartiles of the distribution. Lines extending vertically from the boxplot (whiskers) represent the lowest datum within 1.5 IQR (interquartile range) of the lower quartile and the highest datum within 1.5 IQR of the upper quartile. Data points beyond the whiskers are considered outliers and displayed as circles. To assess whether the differences between the medians of two distributions are significant, we run a nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test, since the distributions are not normal. One or two asterisks denote statistically significant differences between the medians of two distributions (<0.05 or <0.01, respectively).",
