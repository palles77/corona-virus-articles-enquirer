            "text": "Tumor microenvironments play critical regulatory roles in tumor growth. Although mouse cancer models have contributed to the understanding of human tumor biology, the effectiveness of mouse cancer models is limited by the inability of the models to accurately present humanized tumor microenvironments. Previously, a humanized breast cancer model in severe combined immunodeficiency mice was established, in which human breast cancer tissue was implanted subcutaneously, followed by injection of human breast cancer cells. It was demonstrated that breast cancer cells showed improved growth in the human mammary microenvironment compared with a conventional subcutaneous mouse model. In the present study, the novel mouse model and microarray technology was used to analyze changes in the expression of genes in breast cancer cells that are regulated by the human mammary microenvironment. Humanized breast and conventional subcutaneous mouse models were established, and orthotopic tumor cells were obtained from orthotopic tumor masses by primary culture. An expression microarray using Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip and database analyses were performed to investigate changes in gene expression between tumors from each microenvironment. A total of 94 genes were differentially expressed between the primary cells cultured from the humanized and conventional mouse models. Significant upregulation of genes that promote cell proliferation and metastasis or inhibit apoptosis, such as SH3-domain binding protein 5 (BTK-associated), sodium/chloride cotransporter 3 and periostin, osteoblast specific factor, and genes that promote angiogenesis, such as KIAA1618, was also noted. Other genes that restrain cell proliferation and accelerate cell apoptosis, including tripartite motif containing TRIM36 and NES1, were downregulated. The present results revealed differences in various aspects of tumor growth and metabolism between the two model groups and indicated the functional changes specific to the human mammary microenvironment.",

Compared with the conventional subcutaneous (SUB) mouse model, in which human breast cancer cells are directly injected under the subdermis, this novel human breast tissue-derived (HB) mouse model was hypothesized to more accurately mimic the interactions between the human mammary microenvironment and human breast cancer cells (11) . To obtain detailed characterization of this model, tumor formation and metastasis were compared between the HB and SUB mouse models (3) . Orthotopic tumor cells were obtained from orthotopic tumor masses of these two models by primary culture and evaluated in in vitro experiments. In vivo, cellular and molecular experiments compared the biology of human breast cancer cells.

Prior to implantation, the mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 1% pentobarbital sodium (10 \u00b5l/g body weight; Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany). Surgical procedures were modified from a previous method (15) , which transplanted human gastric tissue, whereas in the present study, human mammary tissue was transplanted. Briefly, 5-6-mm scalpel incisions were made in the skin of the left mid-dorsal flank of mice, through which 5 human breast tissue fragments were implanted subcutaneously. The mice received gentamycin in the drinking water (800,000 U/l) until 1 week following the implantation.

Orthotopic tumor masses were collected under sterile conditions. One section was used for histological examination and another section was used for primary culture. Primary culture was conducted as previously described (13) . Briefly, sections of the orthotopic tumor masses (2x2x2 mm) were washed in sterile PBS with 1% penicillin-streptomycin three times, and broken into small tumor pieces using scissors (1-2 Hz for 10 min) in 0.2 ml PBS. PBS (3 ml) was then added to the mixture, and the samples were centrifuged at 129 x g for 5 min in a centrifuge (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Subsequent to discarding the supernatant, the sedimentary tumor pieces were re-suspended in 5 ml DMEM and transferred to 10 cm dishes. Another 10 ml DMEM was added into the dishes for routine cell culture 16 h later. Following 5-7 days of culture, breast cancer cells from small tumor pieces adhered to dishes and the small tumor pieces were discarded. GFP-labeled primary cultured tumor cells were grown to ~80% confluency and harvested for fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) 1 week later. FACS analysis was conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The primary cultured human breast cancer cells were finally obtained, as follows: primary cultured G1315 cells from HB mouse models (pri-HB-1315); and primary cultured G1315 cells from SUB mouse models (pri-SUB-1315).",

Out of the 94 genes, several genes that promoted cell proliferation and metastasis or inhibited apoptosis were upregulated in the pri-HB-1315 group, including SH3BP5 (25), sodium/chloride cotransporter 3 (26, 27) and periostin, osteoblast specific factor (28, 29) . Other genes that restrain cell proliferation and accelerate cell apoptosis were downregulated in the pri-HB-1315 group, such as TRIM36 (30) and NES1 (31) . In addition, genes that promote angiogenesis were upregulated, including KIAA1618 (32). RPL32 is a protein component of ribosomes, which are sites of protein synthesis (33) . Increased expression of the RPL32 gene indirectly reflects the increased cell proliferation. Alterations in the expression of the aforementioned genes jointly induced and promoted the development of tumors in the pri-HB-1315 group with human mammary microenvironment. However, the upregulation of BCL10 (34) and the downregulation of BPTF (35) in the pri-HB-1315 group appear to correspond with the suppression of tumor progression. In addition, the function of certain genes, such as LTBP2 (36, 37) and RNA binding motif (RNP1, RRM) protein 3 (38, 39) , remains controversial. Notably, certain genes, including angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (40) , which functions in cardiovascular disease, have been demonstrated to play important roles in other pathophysiological processes (41), but not tumor progression. In future studies, the putative function of these genes in tumor development and their upstream ligand factors in the human mammary microenvironment may be explored. The mapping of genes to GO nodes is a powerful functional genomics tool suited to the analysis of microarray data, as it may be identified whether associated groups of genes from expression clustering share significant functional annotation in the GO database. As shown in Table II , the significantly enriched functional processes were summarized according to biological process, molecular function and cellular components. These changes indicated the existence of pathological processes globally induced by the human mammary microenvironment. The term definition and details were acquired from the GO network (42) . Out of the 16 results of the GO analyses associated with molecular functions, several genes catalyze various reactions and promote cell metabolism, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity, mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and protein serine/threonine kinase activity. GOs which are expressed differently between two types of cells are termed 'enriched'. Other enriched GO analysis results involved protein interactions to initiate a change in cell activity, such as dopamine receptor activity. The large ribosomal subunit cellular component was upregulated, and plays an important role in protein synthesis. Furthermore, the epithelial cell proliferation biological process was significantly enriched, and is an important component in breast cancer. The GO analysis revealed differences in various aspects of tumor growth and metabolism between the two model groups and indicated the functional changes specific to the human mammary microenvironment.",

However, the mouse immune system is distinct from the human immune system, and immunodeficient mice have acted as a good platform for implanting a human immune system (43) (44) (45) . Certain efforts have already been made in implanting human immune tissues or cells into immunodeficient mouse models (43) (44) (45) . Indeed, since the implanted human breast tissues cannot survive physically in the mouse body as in the human body, the HB mouse model is not able to absolutely mimic all the species-specific interactions between human breast cancer cells and the human mammary microenvironment. In addition, future studies may be performed using more cell lines and clinical specimens.",
