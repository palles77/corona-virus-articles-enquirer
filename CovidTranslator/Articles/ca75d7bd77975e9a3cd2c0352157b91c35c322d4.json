            "text": "Background. The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 is now pandemic. Reliable estimates of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are essential to guide control efforts and to plan health care system requirements. The objectives of this study are to: 1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data; 2) give estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for bias in the two regions with the world's highest numbers of confirmed Covid-19 deaths: Hubei province, China and northern Italy. Method and Findings. We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases; preferential ascertainment of severe cases and delayed mortality (right-censoring). We fitted our transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei province (1 January to 11 February 2020) and northern Italy (8 February to 3 March 2020). Overall mortality among all symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was estimated to be 3.0% (95% credible interval: 2.6-3.4%) in Hubei province and 3.3% (2.0-4.7%) in northern Italy. Mortality increased with age; we estimate that among 80+ year olds, 39.0% (95%CrI: 31.1-48.9%) in Hubei province and 89.0% (95%CrI: 56.2-99.6%) in northern Italy dies or will die. Limitations are that the model requires data recorded by date of onset and that sex-disaggregated mortality was not available. Conclusions. We developed a mechanistic approach to correct the crude CFR for bias due to right-censoring and preferential ascertainment and provide adjusted estimates of mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection by age group. While specific to the situation in Hubei, China and northern Italy during these periods, these findings will help the mitigation efforts and planning of resources as other regions prepare for SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.",

The infection emerged in late 2019 as a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan, Hubei province, China and was named coronavirus disease 2019 in January 2020 [2, 3] . The largest outbreak to date is still that in China, but the number of reported deaths from Covid-19 in Italy (4,032 deaths, population 60 million) has overtaken China (3,261 deaths, population 1.4 billion) [1] . The epidemic appears to have originated from multiple zoonotic transmission events of a coronavirus, with the animal source remaining unknown [4] . The causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in January 2020 [5, 6] . The transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 appear to be similar to those of the 1918 pandemic influenza strain [7] , but, at this early stage, its mortality rate is still unknown. During the early phase of A PREPRINT -22 MARCH 2020 the pandemic, reliable estimates of overall mortality, i.e. the proportion of all people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who will die from the disease are needed to plan health care capacity and for epidemic forecasting. Clinicians need to know age-and sex-specific mortality among symptomatic patients seeking care to assess prognosis and, in severe situations, prioritize patients with the best expected outcomes.",

Other reported measures such as the confirmed, symptomatic or hospitalized CFR, based on different denominators, are sometimes used, adding confusion. The crude CFR can be misleading if used to assess the overall mortality because of two opposing biases [9, 10] . First, because of the delay of several weeks between disease onset and death, the number of confirmed and reported Covid-19 deaths at a certain time point does not consider the total number of deaths that will occur among already infected individuals (right-censoring). Second, surveillance-based Covid-19 case reports underestimate the total number of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, because testing focuses on symptomatic individuals, and, among symptomatic cases, on patients with more severe manifestations (preferential ascertainment). It is often assumed that the crude CFR overestimates true mortality [11] , but it depends on the relative influence of the two opposing biases, so it could differ in different situations.",

The first death was reported on 11 January 2020. Most early cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, which was closed on 1 January. From this point, humanto-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred at a high rate in Wuhan and other areas of Hubei, leading to exponential growth of the reported incidence of Covid-19 cases ( Figure 1A ). On 20 January 2020, Chinese authorities implemented extensive control measures in Hubei: early identification and isolation of clinical cases, tracing and quarantining of contacts, temperature checks before accessing public areas, extension of the lunar new year holiday period, and extreme social distancing, including cancellation of mass gatherings [4] . Three days later, a cordon sanitaire was imposed, with strict traffic restrictions. From 27 January, the daily incidence of cases, by date of disease onset, started to plateau, then decreased. The number of reported deaths started to increase after the increase in incidence, with a delay of a few weeks.",

Lower susceptibility of younger individuals for immunological reasons seems unlikely. There is no indication of pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in humans [4] .

Detection of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited by the focus of testing on symptomatic patients seeking care. Two independent studies have obtained similar estimates using different data sources. During the outbreak on the cruise ship \"Diamond Princess\", nearly all individuals were tested regardless of symptoms, leading to an average proportion of symptomatic infections of 82.1% (95%CrI: 79.8-84.5) of infected people develop symptoms and become infectious [19] . Another study of 87 contacts of infected cases in Shenzhen, China, estimated that 80.4% (95%CrI: 70.9-87.4) were symptomatic [18] . Additionally, dichotomization into asymptomatic and symptomatic is a simplification; SARS-CoV-2 causes a spectrum of symptoms, likely depending on age, sex and comorbidities. Serological surveys will be needed to better characterize asymptomatic infections [25] .",

Verity et al. used a similar approach to ours, but there are differences between the models. They considered all mainland China, where mortality appears to be lower than in Hubei province [27] . They assumed a homogeneous attack rate across age groups rather than simulating epidemics using an age-specific contact matrix, and assumed a reporting rate of only 70% for the elderly. Other studies that attempt to correct for right-censoring of deaths give higher estimates of mortality than in our study. A study using a competing risk model estimated mortality at 7.2% (95% confidence interval: 6.6%-8.0%) for Hubei province [28] . Using data on exported cases, another team estimated mortality of 5.3% (95% confidence interval: 3.5%, 7.5%) among confirmed cases in China [29] . Another team reported a CFR of 18% (95% credible interval: 11-81%) among cases detected in Hubei, accounting for the delay in mortality and estimated the overall CFR at 1% (95% CI: 0.5%-4%), based on data from the early epidemic in Hubei and from cases reported outside China [30] . Our estimate of mortality among all infected cases in Hubei is also higher than in an earlier version of this work (3.0% against 1.6%) [31] . We believe the newer estimate to be more reliable for two reasons. First, we implemented age-specific risks of transmission through a contact matrix, which partially explains the age patterns in reported Covid-19 cases and leads to lower estimates of the total number of infections, thus increasing mortality. Second, a higher estimated proportion of symptomatic people, based on new studies [19, 18] , also led to higher estimates of mortality among all infected.",

For instance, very few deaths have been reported so far in South Korea [33] . In this country, there is a large excess of young women in a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections associated with the Shincheonji Church of Jesus [34] . The higher number of young people among cases, widespread testing and better management of the epidemic might explain the fewer numbers of reported fatalities. The disproportionate influence of this cluster on the age-specific distribution of cases prevented us from applying the same model based on the age distributions in the general population. Data from other countries, in particular the number of cases by date of disease onset and the age and gender distribution of cases and deaths, are necessary to better understand the variability in mortality across settings.",

The age-specific differences in mortality can be intuitively understood by comparing the age distributions of cases and deaths in both settings ( Figure 1B and D) , with an even more marked age shift in Italy resulting in higher mortality estimates in that group ( Figure 3A and 5A). The specific causes of this age trend are unknown, but early discussions have focused on the associations between SARS-CoV-2 and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension and the role of ACE inhibitors [35] . Here, we simply compared the prevalence of four comorbidities (diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, cardio-vascular disease and hypertension) among deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in China with the expected prevalence according to the age distribution of deaths. Only for diabetes was there an excess among SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths. The prevalence of the other comorbidities was similar or lower than expected in a Chinese population with that age distribution. The reliance on data that are not gender-disaggregated means that hypotheses about the potential influence of gender-related differences like smoking patterns could not be explored. This ecological observation does not refute any causality between these comorbidities and SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, as the age trend itself may be related to a higher prevalence of ageing-associated diseases, but highlights that the very specific age pattern of mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection must be accounted for when discussing association with comorbidities.",
