Sometimes it is termed postbronchiolitis syndrome. 4 The previous UK-based Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network guideline 5 refers to post-bronchiolitis syndrome as the presence of any respiratory symptoms that includes chronic cough. However, in the most recent UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, 'postbronchiolitis syndrome' is implied as \"a chronic, relapsing episodic wheeze with subsequent viral infections may occur over the ensuing 6 months or so.\" 1 Given the high prevalence of bronchiolitis 1 and the potential impact of chronic cough on the quality of life, 6 multiple doctor visits, 7 and adverse effects from inappropriate use of medications, 8 the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) panel considered several questions relating to chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration) post-bronchiolitis to be important.",

Transparency of process was documented. Further details of the methods have been published elsewhere. 9,13 Consistent with recent recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine (previously referred to as the Institute of Medicine), the Panel conducted a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature to provide the evidence base for this guideline.\" During the Delphi approach, those with a 'conflict of interest' were not permitted to vote.

Given the burden of chronic cough including the negative effect on quality of life, 6 until more data specific to chronic cough postacute bronchiolitis become available, we suggest that these children are managed in accordance with current CHEST pediatric cough guidelines. 11, 15, 16 Of the total of 23 recommendations/suggestions from these guidelines, the ones most likely applicable are the recommendations to evaluate for the presence of cough pointers and the use of 2 weeks of antibiotics targeted to common respiratory bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis) and local antibiotic sensitivities managing in children with wet or productive cough unrelated to an underlying disease and without any specific cough pointers (eg, coughing with feeding, digital clubbing). 15, 16 No relevant papers were identified for KQ2 or KQ3. Post-publication of the American Academy of Pediatrics 2 and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 1 bronchiolitis guidelines, our search identified several other RCTs that also found that hypertonic saline was not efficacious for the various clinical outcomes examined (none examined for development or treatment of chronic cough) in children with bronchiolitis. In the context that neither asthma medications nor hypertonic saline is efficacious for acute bronchiolitis, 1 both groups of interventions are also not recommended for post-bronchiolitis chronic cough. However, as current data suggest that the incidence of asthma is increased post-acute viral bronchiolitis, 17 clinicians should assess for the presence of the symptoms and signs of asthma (eg, recurrent wheeze and dyspnea responsive to beta 2 agonists), which is inline with recommendations in current CHEST chronic cough guidelines. 11, 15, 16 Using CHEST's framework, as our systematic reviews found no data specific to our KQs, only suggestions could be formulated.",

There are currently little data regarding the transition from acute to chronic cough. 18 While studies have reported that some children with persistent symptoms post-bronchiolitis, their individual outcomes are unknown. Thus, we suggest multi-center cohort studies involving children with bronchiolitis of different severity in various clinical settings (rural-remote vs urban) to evaluate their individual outcomes focusing on cough and the etiology immediately postbronchiolitis. 2. RCTs should include various interventions (eg, antibiotics for wet cough and inhaled or short course oral corticosteroids for dry cough post-acute bronchiolitis) that may be efficacious for chronic cough postbronchiolitis. The RCTs should utilize validated cough outcomes and a priori definitions. 3. Studies on whether tobacco smoke exposure (in utero, post-natal, and environmental) and air quality contribute to the development of chronic cough postbronchiolitis such as large cohort and/or case control studies in different settings. 4. Are there specific risk factors and/or pathogens that are likely to result in post-bronchiolitis chronic cough? For example, does the presence of polymicrobial (eg, mixed viral-bacteria) pathogens in the airways increase the risk of developing chronic cough?",
