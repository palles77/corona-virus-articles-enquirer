To analyze the immunogenicity of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV, spike DNA vaccine and the immunoregulatory activity of interleukin-2 (IL-2), DNA vaccine plasmids pcDNA-S and pcDNA-IL-2 were constructed and inoculated into BALB/c mice with or without pcDNA-IL-2 by using three different immunization routes (the intramuscular route, electroporation, or the oral route with live attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium). The cellular and humoral immune responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, lymphocyte proliferation assays, enzyme-linked immunospot assays, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses. The results showed that specific humoral and cellular immunities could be induced in mice by inoculating them with SARS-CoV spike DNA vaccine alone or by coinoculation with IL-2-expressing plasmids. In addition, the immune response levels in the coinoculation groups were significantly higher than those in groups receiving the spike DNA vaccine alone.",

            "text": "An international outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an atypical form of pneumonia, caused about 8,000 cases and 774 deaths across more than 30 countries, starting from its emergence in mid-November 2002 until 7 August 2003. The etiology of SARS was identified as a new coronavirus (CoV), named SARS-CoV (13, 22, 29, 37) . The SARS-CoV genome is approximately 29,000 bp and encodes four main structure proteins, including the spike (S) protein, the membrane (M) protein, the envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (9, 22, 37) . The S glycoprotein is responsible for binding to receptors on host cells and plays an important role in membrane fusion (6, 21, 30, 32, 33) . Moreover, antibodies to this protein not only neutralize the virus in vitro but also protect against lethal SARS-CoV challenge (21, 38, 46) . It has previously been shown that pseudotype lentiviral particles bearing the SARS-CoV S protein could be inhibited by sera from SARS patients (21) . In addition, the CD8 T-cell epitopes identified in the SARS-CoV S protein have been shown to elicit a T-cell response in SARS-CoV-infected pa-tients (39) . Hence, the S protein is an attractive target for both therapeutics and vaccine development. Several SARS-CoV Sprotein-based vaccines have been shown to generate antibodies and cellular immune responses (25, 42, 44) . Therefore, our study focused on the SARS-CoV S protein as a target antigen for the development of a DNA vaccine.",

The activation and the proliferation of lymphocytes play a critical role in both the on March 19, 2020 by guest http://cvi.asm.org/ humoral and the cellular immune responses induced by vaccination. Therefore, we next evaluated whether vaccination with pcDNA-S in the presence or the absence of immunization with pcDNA-IL-2 by the different routes could influence antigenspecific T-cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 3 , higher levels of lymphocytes stimulated by the S protein were observed in mice immunized with pcDNA-S alone or with pcDNA-S plus pcDNA-IL-2 than in the controls (P \u03fd 0.01). The level of cell proliferation in animals coimmunized with pcDNA-IL-2 was appreciably higher than that in animals immunized with pcDNA-S alone (P \u03fd 0.05). The level of splenocyte proliferation in response to oral immunization with pcDNA-S or pcDNA-S plus pcDNA-IL-2 was consistently and significantly higher than that in response to immunization by the other two routes (P \u03fd 0.05). Immunization by the i.m. route induced a stronger T-cell response than immunization by electroporation. These results indicate that immunization with pcDNA-S and pcDNA-S plus pcDNA-IL-2 elicits recognizable levels of antigen-specific T-cell responses and that immunization by the oral routes evokes the strongest immune response. S-protein-specific Th1-and Th2-type responses. ELISPOT was used to assess the magnitudes of the S-protein-specific IFN-\u2425 (Th1) and IL-4 (Th2) T-cell responses after the mice were vaccinated with pcDNA-S DNA or pcDNA-S plus pcDNA-IL-2. The protein dosage used for stimulation and the number of splenocytes were optimized to induce IFN-\u2425 and IL-4 T-cell responses (data not shown). Splenocytes from vaccinated mice were harvested 10 days after the final vaccination, and S-protein-specific IFN-\u2425 and IL-4 levels were enumerated by ELISPOTs. As shown in Fig. 4A and B, only small numbers of nonspecific IFN-\u2425-and IL-4-secreting cells were detected in the control groups by ELISPOTs (\u054510 spots/10 6 cells). By ELISPOT, the background counts in wells containing splenocytes in the absence of mitogens or nominal antigens were about the same as those for the control groups. Significant numbers of S-protein-specific IFN-\u2425 and IL-4 spots were detected for all the immunized groups by ELISPOTs (P \u03fd 0.01). Compared to immunization with pcDNA-S alone, a two-or threefold increase in antigen-specific IFN-\u2425-secreting cell numbers was detected in mice coimmunized with pcDNA and IL-2 by all three immunization routes (P \u03fd 0.05). However, the IL-4-secreting cell number was not as high as the IFN-\u2425-secreting cell number in the groups to which pcDNA and IL-2 were coadministered and was appreciably higher only than that in the group immunized with pcDNA-S alone.",

Since activated CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T lymphocytes are among the most crucial components of antiviral effectors, the responses to these lymphocytes were assessed in the vaccinated mice (Fig. 5) . Flow cytometric analysis of unstimulated cells was used to standardize the background responses, and there was little variation in the responses among nonimmunized mice. The vaccinations with pcDNA-S and pcDNA-S plus pcDNA-IL-2 significantly increased the percentages of activated CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 cells FIG. 3. S-protein-specific LPA. Pooled splenocytes were obtained from mice (three mice per group) immunized with the DNA vaccine on day 10 postimmunization with pcDNA-IL-2. Splenocytes were stimulated in vitro with S protein (test groups), ConA (positive controls), and bovine serum albumin (irrelevant antigen controls). Splenocytes from the control groups (immunized with pcDNA-IL-2, pcDNA3.1, or PBS) were stimulated with the S protein and served as negative controls and sham controls. The SI was calculated by use of the following formula: (mean OD of ConA-or antigen-stimulated proliferation)/(mean OD of nonstimulated proliferation). Each bar represents the mean SI \u03ee SD for three mice. The numbers of activated CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 cells increased in all immunized groups. The CD8 \u03e9 /CD4 \u03e9 ratio in the groups immunized with pcDNA-S plus pcDNA-IL-2 was higher than that in the groups immunized with pcDNA-S for all three immunization routes, but the difference was not statistically significant (P \u03fe 0.05). Moreover, immunization by the oral route induced a substantial CD8 \u03e9 response, while immunization by electroporation induced a negligible CD8 \u03e9 response. This result paralleled the Ig response of the group immunized by electroporation, which induced the highest level of CD4 \u03e9 and the lowest level of CD8 \u03e9 . These results further reinforce the fact that the S-protein DNA vaccine can elicit a T-cell response in mice by use of the three immunization routes and that IL-2 expression can enhance the T-lymphocyte activity induced by the S-protein DNA vaccine.",

These results indicate that the S-protein DNA vaccine activates both the Th1 and the Th2 subsets, and the level of activation of the Th1 subset was much higher, which correlated with the tendency for the IgG2a antibody levels to be elevated. These findings suggest that the S-protein DNA vaccine is effective in activating both B and T cells to generate anti-S-protein antibodies and cellular immune (mainly Th1) responses in mice.

IL-2 is a cytokine that can potently activate multiple compartments of the immune system, including T-helper cells, cytotoxic T cells, B cells, macrophages, and NK cells (14, 23, 40) . Some evidence has suggested that the coadministration of plasmids encoding IL-2 and a given antigen results in the enhancement of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to that antigen and mostly favors Th1 cell differentiation (14, 34, 40, 41) . In the current study, the immune responses in mice immunized with the SARS-CoV S-protein DNA vaccine alone were compared to those in mice coimmunized with a plasmid encoding IL-2 by analyzing antibodies, T-cell proliferation, T-helper-cell responses, and CD8 \u03e9 T-cell responses. The mice which received pcDNA-IL-2 adjuvant rapidly generated IgG antibodies (data not shown), and the antibody levels were much higher than those in mice given the antigen-encoding plasmid alone. Both IgG1 and IgG2a antibody levels increased in all groups immunized with the combination, and the dominant isotype did not change by coinjection of the IL-2-expressing vector. A similar pattern was observed in the T-cell immune responses measured by LPA, ELISPOT, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Our results showed that immunization with pcDNA-S plus pcDNA-IL-2 elicited recognizably higher levels of T-cell responses compared to those in the groups immunized with pcDNA-S alone. Taken together, our results provide evidence that strategies that include IL-2 as an adjuvant can be used to enhance the protective immunity of candidate SARS-CoV vaccines. These results are consistent with previous findings obtained with animal models of chronic viral infection, which showed that the administration of IL-2 enhances viral antigen-specific Th1 immune responses and improves clinical outcomes (2, 8, 23, 41) .",

A DNA vaccine can be delivered by the i.m. route through a needle, by the intradermal route, by the subcutaneous route with a gene gun, by electroporation, or by the oral route with live attenuated bacteria. In general, immunization by injection induces both humoral and cellular immune responses. Recently, it has been found that the application of an electric field to tissues in vivo significantly increases the levels of DNA uptake and gene expression (48) . However, oral immunization by the use of Salmonella vaccines which bear foreign antigens can induce strong protective immune re- sponses against a wide variety of infectious diseases in animal models (10, 11, 16, 43) , and such oral vaccines can influence the immune profiles by augmenting the mucosal and cellular immunities compared to those achieved by administration by injection. For the SARS-CoV vaccine, it was previously described that immunization with Salmonella-carrying S-protein peptides induced protective antibodies (42) . Therefore, we investigated whether different vaccination routes could change the immune types, especially when an IL-2 gene adjuvant is combined with the SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine.",

            "text": "To facilitate DNA vaccine delivery in a mouse model, we chose three different immunization routes, the i.m. route, electroporation, and the oral route by the use of live attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. The vaccine with or without pcDNA-IL-2 described here was administered by these immunization routes. After the evaluation and a comparison study of the efficiencies of these immunization schedules, our results showed that immunization by the i.m. route induced a moderate T-cell response and an antibody response, predominantly comprising an IgG2a response, and that these responses were better than those obtained by oral immunization. Vaccination by electroporation resulted in the highest antibody response among the three routes of immunization and a midlevel cellular response. In contrast, when the same DNA vaccine was delivered orally with live attenuated Salmonella, vigorous Tcell responses but weak antibody production dominated by the IgG2a subclass was evoked. IgG1 subclass antibody responses were evoked by immunization by all three routes, further suggesting that the processed antigens were recognized by Th2 cells in association with IL-4. In addition, for all three vaccination routes enhanced immune responses were observed in groups coimmunized with IL-2 DNA, including increased antigen-specific proliferative responses, higher levels of IFN-\u2425 production, and increased CD8 \u03e9 T-cell numbers. These results suggest that those distinct types of immune responses generated were due to the different immunization routes but not to coimmunization with IL-2 DNA. On the basis of our observation that vaccination with DNA by the oral route induced a strong T-cell-mediated immune response, whereas immunization by the i.m. route and electroporation induced moderate T-cell responses but vigorous antibody responses, further studies should be carried out by using a combination of both oral and injection immunizations to stimulate higher cellular and humoral immune responses. In addition, our results also show that the delivery of DNA vaccines by electroporation and orally by using live attenuated Salmonella in vivo is an effective method for increasing the level of antigen expression in muscle tissues, leading to marked improvements in immune responses.",

            "text": "It should be noted that delivery of the same DNA by different routes induced different immune response profiles. This might be due to the different ways of presentation of the S-protein antigen by professional antigen-presenting cells when it is delivered by the i.m. route, electroporation, or the oral route. Live attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhimurium could selectively infect M cells. If the DNA encoding the S protein was selectively carried into mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue cells, termed M cells, most of the S peptides within the M cells might be cleaved and presented through the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I pathway, giving rise to a strong cellular response. On the other hand, only a very small amount of the S-protein peptides generated in the M cells might be secreted and presented by B cells through the MHC class II pathway, resulting in a poor antibody response. In our study, the MHC class I and class II pathways were simultaneously evoked to some extent by both the i.m. and the electroporation immunization routes. This is supported by the findings from a study of the hepatitis B virus DNA vaccine presented by live attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (43) . Similar results were also reported by Zheng et al. (47) , who showed that live oral vaccination of mice with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium delivering DNA-HBsAg (oral DNA vaccine) evoked a vigorous T-cell response and a weak antibody response predominantly of the IgG2a subclass. Thus, different formulations of the same plasmid DNA vaccine can induce distinct immune responses.",

Further refinements of the immunization conditions, especially the DNA immune dose, are required to ensure the maximal expansion of SARS-CoV S-protein DNA vaccine effectors.",

DNA vaccines also hold promise for use in humans. However, the effects in mice may be more dramatic than those in humans, and the current technologies have significant limitations that prevent the full effectiveness of DNA vaccines in larger animals. Many aspects still remain to be considered prior to the development of a DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV in humans. In the present report, we have demonstrated that the SARS-CoV S-protein DNA vaccine coadministered with an IL-2-expressing plasmid induces specific immune responses in mice. However, we did not run tests with any other animal models; so it is still unknown whether this approach could be applied to other animal models, and its immunogenicity in humans remains to be established. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the efficacy of this SARS-CoV DNA vaccine in some highly relevant translational models to demonstrate the responsiveness of humans, and further studies should be conducted to validate whether this type of vaccination can be extended to humans.",
