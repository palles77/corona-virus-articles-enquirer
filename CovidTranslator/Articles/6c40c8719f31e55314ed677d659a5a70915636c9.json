Sensitive and robust techniques are needed to quantify proteolytic activities within the complex biological milieu. We hypothesized that a combinatorial protease substrate library could be used effectively to identify similarities and differences between serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), two body fluids that are clinically important for developing targeted therapies and diagnostics. We used a concise library of fluorogenic probes to map the protease substrate specificities of serum and BALF from guinea pigs. Differences in the proteolytic fingerprints of the two fluids were striking: serum proteases cleaved substrates containing cationic residues and proline, whereas BALF proteases cleaved substrates containing aliphatic and aromatic residues. Notably, cleavage of proline-containing substrates dominated all other protease activities in both human and guinea pig serum. This substrate profiling approach provides a foundation for quantitative comparisons of protease specificities between complex biological samples.",

Working dilutions of IQFPs were added to BALF or serum in wells of low volume black microplates, and time-resolved fluorescence data were recorded as described. Assay wells contained 100 \u00b5M IQFP in 20 \u00b5L HEPES buffer (buffer composition as described) and 20 \u00b5L BALF or serum. Fold change after 6 h was calculated as f final /f initial , and the two IQFPs demonstrating the greatest extent of cleavage from each selected library well were selected for additional characterization. Effects of photobleaching were addressed through the inclusion of controls containing uncleaved peptides throughout all experiments, as well as through kinetic measurements of the fluorescence of both cleaved and uncleaved control peptides. An IQFP containing the amino acid sequence Ala-Thr-Glu, which was not cleaved by either BALF or serum, was included as an additional negative control.",

Second, both BALF and serum are clinically relevant for diagnosis and therapy of numerous diseases. The importance of serum is well known; BALF, obtained from lavage of the lungs with buffered saline, is an important sample for clinical laboratory evaluation of many respiratory diseases (18) . Third, our study establishes a protease specificity signature that can serve as a baseline for future analysis of diseased samples, much like MS-derived baseline proteomes are often referenced in later investigations of diseased proteomes (12) .

The similarity of the two independent human serum screens was qualitatively evident from comparison of the heatmaps. Linear regression analysis supported a 1:1 relationship of the two data sets (r 2 = 0.771) with only 12 points (2.3%) falling outside the 99% prediction intervals ( Figure 1C ). Seventy-two of 114 total positive wells (63.1%) were identified in both experiments, while 25 (21.9%) were found only in Experiment 1, and 17 (14.9%) were found only in Experiment 2. The heterogeneity of microtiter plates or library synthesis is an unlikely explanation for this modest variability, because the libraries are subjected to rigorous quality control (10) . A more likely explanation involves inherent biological variability arising from different donors contributing the two independent lots of pooled serum (20) . A complete list of sequences and motifs cleaved by human serum is reported in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. We then comparatively assessed the proteolytic profiles of pooled BALF and serum from guinea pigs. When visualized in heatmap format, the protease specificity fingerprints of guinea pig BALF and serum were strikingly different ( Figure 2 ).",

The extent of cleavage of proline-containing substrates, as quantified by fluorescence fold change, was considerably greater than that of substrates that did not contain proline; of the 31 motifs cleaved by serum but not BALF, the top 15 all contained proline at the Xaa position. Complete lists of sequences and motifs cleaved by BALF and serum are reported in Supplementary Tables S3-S6. Linear and nonlinear regression analyses provided information regarding kinetic rates of cleavage that was not reflected in end point fluorescence fold change measurements (Supplementary Tables  S3-S6) . Overall, the cleavage rates correlated well with the end point fold change data, although nonlinear regression failed to converge for some wells that were cleaved to a lesser extent (end point fluorescence fold change ~2.0-2.5). For sequences cleaved by BALF, a strong positive correlation between linear slope and end point fluorescence was observed (r 2 = 0.674, P < 0.0001), whereas nonlinear rate and end point fluorescence were positively correlated with poor significance (r 2 = 0.086, P = 0.016), and linear slope and nonlinear rate failed to show a positive correlation (r 2 = 0.020, P = 0.259) (Supplementary Figure S2) .

When analyzing the cleavage of proline-containing motifs in serum, we identified fragments corresponding to cleavage of some substrates after proline, supporting the possibility that prolyl endopeptidases may be responsible for this activity.

Prolyl endopeptidases are known to cleave at the C-terminal side of proline residues; however, it is possible that aminopeptidases hydrolyze Asn and Gln from the N terminus following cleavage of the Pro\u2193Asn/Gln-Pro bond to generate the fragments we observed.",

The stark distinction of BALF and serum proteolytic profiles, particularly the absence of Pro and Arg/Lys cleavage specificities in BALF, may result from inhibition or degradation of serum-derived proteases in the lung environment. In addition, the reduced cleavage of substrates containing cationic residues in BALF may be due to the lower abundance of proteases associated with the clotting and complement cascades (11, 12) .

Indeed, we observed that cationic residues are prevalent in substrates cleaved by guinea pig serum ( Figure 3B) . Notably, the cleavage pattern of human serum closely matched that of guinea pig serum, although the overall cleavage activity of human serum was lower, perhaps due to differential processing of the commercially obtained human serum preparation (Supplementary Tables S1, S2 , S5, and S6). The similarity of the human and guinea pig serum protease specificity fingerprints supports the possibility that studies of nonhuman samples can provide useful information translatable to human proteases.",

These sequences contained a disproportionate frequency of Asp/Glu and Asn/Gln residues; 79.2% of uncleaved sequences contained at least one of the two. This is not surprising, because Asp/Glu residues are relatively uncommon among protease substrates. Although it is possible that the sequences containing these particular residues are simply uncleavable in the synthetic IQFP format, this explanation is unlikely, because Asn/Gln-containing IQFP sequences were previously found to be cleaved by calpain-2 (10) . Also frequent among the uncleaved library wells were sequences containing Pro in the Yaa position (25.0% percent of all uncleaved sequences), suggesting that serum and BALF proteases recognize Pro-containing sequences preferentially when Pro is adjacent to a Gly residue (Xaa or Zaa positions).",

Also, because exopeptidases may subsequently act on cleaved IQFPs, MALDI-TOF MS-derived information regarding cleavages sites may reflect the action of multiple proteases. In addition, activities of proteases (and inhibitors) in serum and other biological environments are dependent on buffer, concentration, and other conditions related to sample preparation (26) . Thus, ex vivo observations may not always accurately represent the in vivo situation. Similarly, synthetic octapeptide sequences may not recapitulate the folded structures of endogenous substrates. Nonetheless, ex vivo analysis is typically the first step in identification and characterization of proteases in serum and other biological fluids (4, 5) .",

Measurements of abundance alone may not be sufficient for identification of diagnostic or therapeutic targets, because the identified proteases may be inactive or proteolytically degraded. Moreover, protease inhibitors are abundant both in serum and in the lung (11, 12) , so proteases may be present but inactivated by their respective inhibitors. Although a small (192 sequences) solid-phase library was previously used to detect proteolytic specificity of clinical blood samples, BioTechniques Focus: Proteomics our approach expands probe sequence space by 17-fold and permits more physiological solution-phase kinetics as compared with that study (27) . MS-based exoprotease substrate profiling has recently been suggested for cancer biomarker discovery as well, further supporting this approach (28) . Once proteolytic specificities of interest are identified, the responsible proteases can be identified through the use of active sitedirected probes designed from the known substrate specificity, as demonstrated by Saghatelian and coworkers for selective isolation of metalloproteases (7) .",
