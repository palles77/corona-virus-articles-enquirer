However, often, the total number of infected individuals at the end of the epidemics is much lower than predicted from the early dynamics. This discrepancy is argued to result from human intervention or nonlinear dynamics not incorporated in standard models. We show that when variability in infection rates is included in standard susciptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models the total number of infected individuals in the late dynamics can be orders lower than predicted from the early dynamics. This discrepancy holds for SIS and SIR models, where the assumption that all individuals have the same sensitivity is eliminated. In contrast with network models, fixed partnerships are not assumed. We derive a moment closure scheme capturing the distribution of sensitivities. We find that the shape of the sensitivity distribution does not affect R 0 or the number of infected individuals in the early phases of the epidemics. However, a wide distribution of sensitivities reduces the total number of removed individuals in the SIR model and the steady-state infected fraction in the SIS model. The difference between the early and late dynamics implies that in order to extrapolate the expected effect of the epidemics from the initial phase of the epidemics, the rate of change in the average infectivity should be computed. These results are supported by a comparison of the theoretical model to the Ebola epidemics and by numerical simulation.",

In mean-field epidemiological models, the concept of the basic reproductive number, Ro, has been systematically employed as a predictor for epidemic spread and as an analytical tool to study the threshold conditions [1] [2] [3] [4] . An advantage of Ro is that in many models it determines both the threshold for the emergence of an epidemic and the expected final outcome of an outbreak [5, 6] . It has thus been widely used to gauge the degree of threat that a specific infectious agent will pose as an outbreak progresses [7, 8] .",

Each susceptible individual has a different probability to get infected, but all infected individuals have the same probability to infect other susceptible individuals. Specifically, individuals exist in two discrete states-\"healthy\" or \"infected\"-in the SIS model, and three discrete states-\"healthy,\" \"infected,\" or \"recovered\"-in the SIR model. At each time step, each susceptible (healthy) individual i is infected with rate \u03b2 i . At the same time, infected individuals are cured and become susceptible again with rate \u03b3 in the SIS model, or recovered in the SIR model. The value of \u03b2 i is only a function of the person getting infected and not the person infecting, and it does not vary over time for a given individual. Given a variable probability to get infected in the population, we define the number of susceptible individuals with a \u03b2 i value between \u03b2 and \u03b2 + d\u03b2 as S(\u03b2)d\u03b2 and the number of infected individuals as I (\u03b2)d\u03b2. We further define N(\u03b2) as N (\u03b2) = S(\u03b2) + I (\u03b2). Note that N (\u03b2) does not change over time and is thus equal to its initial condition. We have studied multiple distributions for this initial condition, as shall be further explained. S is the sum over all the susceptible individuals with different probability to get infected, I is the sum over all the infected individuals with different probability to get infected, and N is the sum over all the susceptible individuals and infected individuals with different probability to get infected.

We assume full mixing and a mass action formalism, allowing for a very small number of infected individuals to spread the pathogen.

Thus in Eq. (24), r(t) is expected to decrease much faster than in the constant \u03b2 scenario, as is indeed the case. The source of the difference between the SF and all other distributions is the presence of the very high \u03b2 values in the population (even if they are rare). People with such high values of \u03b2 are almost automatically infected, and they increase E I (\u03b2) sharply. Note that they also slightly decrease E S (\u03b2). In all other distributions, the variance of \u03b2 is limited per definition by the requirement that all individuals have positive \u03b2 values. Thus, while the normal distribution cannot have a large variance, in the case of the SF distribution, \u03b2 could get in principle values between (0,\u221e).

The conclusion from the results above are that in order to estimate the future dynamics, it is not enough to know R 0 , but the change in E I (\u03b2) should be estimated. While this cannot be estimated directly, we can directly quantify the effect this has on S * E S (\u03b2) through the disease dynamics. Specifically, a decrease in E S (\u03b2) is expected to lead to a parallel decrease in I /I . In the bottom graph of Fig. 3 , we calculated the difference in the number of infected individuals in every time step, divided by the total number of infected individuals in the same time. The total decrease in the expected value of \u03b2 in the S compartment and the increase in the expected value of \u03b2 in the I compartments are clear in the SF distribution, while it is more limited in all other distributions. This can be clearly seen in the measures of E S (\u03b2), in E I (\u03b2), and in I /I . The mechanism driving the difference is straightforward. In normal or uniform distribution the variance in \u03b2 is limited, thus even infecting the most susceptible individuals does not significantly affect the values of E I (\u03b2) and E S (\u03b2).

We computed the theoretical parameters providing the best fit to the epidemics in each of the three distributions described above as well as the standard SIR models. There are now known cases of reexposure to Ebola. We thus fit the SIR and not the SIS model. For example, the free parameters are as follows: for the SF distribution N is number of the population, \u03b1,\u03b2 min ,\u03b2 max ,I 0 ,\u03b3 ; for the Gaussian distribution, N,\u03bc,\u03c3,\u03b3,I 0 ; for the uniform distribution, N,\u03b2 min ,\u03b2 max ,\u03b3 ,I 0 ; and for the constant model, N,\u03b2,\u03b3,I 0 . Using the observed I 0 leads to suboptimal results for all models. This is probably the case since in the early dynamics, stochastic fluctuations can affect the results. We thus estimate I 0 from the dynamics later when enough cases are available.",

We found that in realistic cases, nonuniform models provide a better description of the observed epidemics than the model where there is a constant transmission coefficient for the entire population. In the early dynamics, only the first moment of \u03b2 determines the dynamics, and there is no difference between the models as long as they have the same transmission rate. Later, the second moment of \u03b2 starts affecting the dynamics for both the SIR and SIS models. During this period, the scale-free distribution behaves differently from other distributions and results in a lower number of infected individuals than expected. This reduction is the result of a difference between the first moment of \u03b2 in the different compartments (S, I ). There is a sharp increase in the average value of \u03b2 among infected compartments, accompanied by a smaller decrease in the susceptible compartment, compared with the initial value. Such an effect can only be observed in distributions where the second moment of \u03b2 in the total population is large enough. The difference is then further enlarged in steady state where all distributions of the transmission coefficient in the population lead to a smaller number of infected individuals compared with the model with constant \u03b2, but the biggest difference is in the SF model, again explained by the high second moment of \u03b2 in this distribution. We have then tested this conclusion by studying the spread of the Ebola virus in multiple African countries. An F test between the different distributions shows that they all produce a better fit than the constant \u03b2 model. We attempted to detect early in the infection whether the total number of people affected by the epidemics will deviate significantly from the results expected from the early dynamics.",

The most classical example is perhaps the huge difference between the predictions and the observed amplitude of the JCD [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Many models can explain this discrepancy, including, among others, nonlinear dynamics [59, 60] , delays [61, 62] , human intervention, passive vaccination [63, 64] , and small effective population [65] [66] [67] . We show here that even in the most standard SIR and SIS models, the initial dynamics cannot determine the total number of people affected by the epidemics. However, quite early in the dynamics, the relative infection rate I /I can be used to detect significant deviations from the straightforward dynamics expected from these models. The large difference is only expected if the distribution of \u03b2 values is large. Such a large difference can be the result of intrinsic differences, but also the result of environmental differences, partial mixing, or subpopulation structure. Understanding this distribution in advance would improve our capacity to relate early and late dynamics. We now plan to develop methods to estimate this distribution from finer measures early in the disease dynamics.",
