            "text": "By far and away the most important pulmonary diseases in man are related to the smoking of tobacco. However, occupational lung diseases caused by inhalation of industrial chemicals, particulate matter and antigens are also important causes of morbidity and mortality. For this reason, considerable effort has been directed to the examination of airborne pollutants over recent years, including study of their effects in laboratory animals when administered by the inhalation route. Extensive study has shown that a complex array of defensive mechanisms protects the lung against the adverse effects of airborne substances and pathogenic organisms. Aerodynamic factors prevent access of particles larger than 10 \u00b5m diameter for these are deposited on the walls of the nasal passages. Particles measuring between 2 and 10 \u00b5m diameter tend to be trapped by the mucus-covered ciliated epithelium lining the bronchial tree and removed by mucociliary transport aided by the cough reflex. Smaller particles may reach the alveoli where they are ingested and transported by pulmonary macrophages (Murphy and Florman, 1983) .",

Through their specific pharmacological action drugs can produce excessive effects on bronchial calibre or pulmonary function. Drugs mediate allergic reactions in the bronchi or lungs. They may also produce a variety of obscure, diffuse pulmonary alveolar conditions including a pulmonary syndrome resembling systemic lupus erythematosus. As the respiratory tract is a major route by which microorganisms gain entry into the body, opportunistic pulmonary infections with bacteria, viruses, fungi or protozoa are consequences of immunosuppression or broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. As in other organs drugs that disturb coagulation may precipitate pulmonary thromboembolism or haemorrhage. Localised lung lesions also result from accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic inhalation of xenobiotics. Mucociliary clearance is also sensitive to therapeutic agents that affect the secretion of mucus and fluid, ciliary activity and transport (Sturgess, 1985) . Treatment with antacids or histamine H 2 blockers can also increase the risk of pneumonia developing in patients in intensive care units through increasing gastric pH, which leads to an overgrowth of gram-negative bacteria in the stomach and retrograde pharyngeal colonisation (Craven et al., 1986) .",

Intranasal or inhalation modes of therapy pose particular challenges in terms of the novel formulations and the technologies required to administer drug as well as the potential impact of the different anatomical and physiological characteristics of the airways on drug toxicity, disposition and metabolism. The development of drugs to be administered by inhalation or intranasal routes is particularly difficult because of the perceived risks of high local drug concentration in respiratory tissues, alterations to drug disposition and a potentially vulnerable patient population, often with pulmonary disease (DeGeorge et al., 1998) .",

Site of deposition depends primarily on particle size, but variability in the sites of deposition occurs among different laboratory animal species and man by virtue of the differences in the size and shape of the respiratory passages as well as breathing patterns (Sweeney and Brain, 1991) . The relative distribution of monodisperse aerosols in man and rat were found to be comparable when particles of 1-3 \u00b5m diameter were inhaled, but different above this size range (Raabe, 1980) . The subsequent fate of inhaled particles depends not only on their size but also their shape, chemical nature, and solubility in body fluids. Soluble sub-stances are absorbed into the blood stream and are removed by the pulmonary circulation. They may also undergo metabolism by enzymes present in the cell populations of the respiratory tract and reactive metabolites may cause local pulmonary damage. Insoluble, inert particles are removed primarily by the mucociliary transport system of the trachea and bronchi or through phagocytosis by macrophages. Overload of the lung by even relatively inert, non-fibrous particles such as titanium dioxide or carbon black may impair alveolar macrophage-mediated particle clearance (Warheit et al., 1995) . This may lead in turn to accumulation of dusts over time with eventual fibrotic and tumorigenic responses.",

This suggests that the nasal mucosa not only has a capacity for metabolising and activating xenobiotics by oxidation, but also for hydration and inactivation of potentially toxic epoxides and conjugating electrophilic, reactive metabolites with reduced glutathione. In addition, it has been shown that the distribution of immune-reactive enzymes is different in olfactory and respiratory mucosa and the differences correlate with activity shown by enzyme histochemical methods (Bogdanffy, 1990) . Xenobiot-ics can be metabolised within both olfactory and respiratory mucosa, but the olfactory regions appear to possess greatest capability for oxidative metabolism. Consequently, regional differences in nasal toxicity and tumour formation from inhaled materials may not only be a response to different water solubility and deposition patterns but also differences in the formation of reactive metabolites (Bogdanffy, 1990) . Another feature of this metabolising activity is that it can be induced by systemically administered xenobiotics. This occurs in a way that can alter the distribution of enzyme activity in the nasal mucosa (Baron et al., 1988) .",

Morgan (1991) has described the approaches that can be adopted for the identification and recording of lesions in toxicity studies. In larger species, particularly dogs and primates sectioning and blocking is more complex. Although dissection is required, a similar procedure following decalcification can be adopted (Levinski et al., 1981) . Examination of cytokeratin expression in the respiratory mucosa can also be used as a marker of epithelial differentiation in the respiratory tract. Schlage et al.

Histologically, the olfactory epithelium showed necrosis of the superficial epithelial layers including the sustentacular and sensory cells with sparing of the basal cell layer. There was also damage to Bowman's glands. The development of proliferative lesions and ultimately tumours of principally neuroectodermal origin followed chronic treatment. As RP 73401 was highly metabolised and the nasal lesions could be inhibited by treatment of rats with metyrapone, a nonspecific inhibitor of cytochromes P450, it was postulated that the changes were the result of P450-mediated activation in the olfactory tissues, not linked to its pharmacological phosphodiesterase activity (Pino et al., 1999) .",

It is a pyramidal cell located principally at the junction of septa with a microvillous brush border on the surface. Neurosecretory cells (Kultschitsky or APUD cells) are located in the epithelial surface of the larynx, trachea bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli (Becker and Gazdar, 1985) . These cells are oval or cuboidal with oval nuclei, argyrophilic cytoplasm which electron microscopic examination shows to contain dense core granules. The role of neuroendocrine cells in the lung is uncertain but immunocytochemical study has shown them to contain neurone-specific enolase and a variety of peptides similar to vasoactive intestinal peptide, bombesin, calcitonin, serotonin, leu-encephalin, \u03b2-endorphin and ACTH (Becker and Gazdar, 1985; Sturgess, 1985) .",

Baron and colleagues showed that the different cell populations contained different amounts of enzymes, Clara cells containing the greatest concentrations of the phenobarbitone-inducible isoenzyme of cytochrome P450, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and epoxide hydrolase. Studies of microsomal enzyme activities suggest that lung tissue contains fewer P450 isoenzymes than liver, principally forms 1A1, 2B1, 3A2 and 4B1 (Smith and Brain, 1991) . Whereas P450 enzyme activity is highly concentrated in specific cell types, overall microsomal enzyme activity is low compared with liver on a per gram of microsomal protein (Smith and Brain, 1991) .

Sequential studies showed that the initial damage to bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium is associated with polymorphonuclear and lymphocytic inflammation (bronchiolitis). Immunocytochemical and ultrastructural studies revealed the presence of viral antigen in the mucosa (Jakab, 1981) . Hyperplastic and multinucleated syncytial epithelial cells develop in the hyperplastic terminal bronchiolar epithelium and the inflammatory process extended to involve peribronchial or peribronchiolar parenchyma with infiltration of alveolar walls by mononuclear cells, macrophages and neutrophils. A similar cell population accompanied by cell debris and oedema fluid develops in air spaces. Pulmonary arteries show only minor involvement with inflammatory cells and focal reactive hyperplasia of the endothelium. Immunocytochemistry and ultrastructural examination has suggested that virus replication take place in alveolar type I and type II epithelial cells and macrophages but not in endothelial or interstitial cells of the alveolar septae (Castleman et al., 1987) . It was shown that repair occurs but there may be residual distortion of bronchiolar and alveolar walls by collagen. Increased tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) expression has been shown to be an important regulatory factor in the development of Sendai virus-induced bronchiolar fibrosis in infected rats (Uhi et al., 1998) .

The syndrome of visceral larva migrans is usually defined as that which results from the migration of nematode larvae into the viscera. It has been well described in the beagle dog lung where it results from the larvae of toxocara species or metastrongyloid nematodes (Barron and Saunders, 1966; Hirth and Hottendorf, 1973 ). The precise identification of parasites is not always possible in tissue sections. Histological appearances of infested lungs are highly variable. Nematodes surrounded by granulomas and granulomatous inflammation, mostly in a subpleural location, may be visible in sections. In affected lungs there may be perivasculitis and active arteriolitis, bronchiolitis and peribronchiolitis. Pleural involvement by the inflammatory process can be marked, particularly in regions overlying granulomas. Scarring develops and pleural and subpleural fibrosis frequently associated with epithelial hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia of the associated airways (Hirth and Hottendorf, 1973) . The lesions may sufficiently marked to resemble those induced by high doses of anticancer drugs such as bleomycin (see below).",

Reproduction of the mites appears to take place in the terminal bronchioles. Pneumonyssus simicola is the recognised form found in rhesus monkeys (Kim, 1988) . Although it is most prevalent in wild caught primates, the disease is not easily eliminated during breeding in captivity (Joseph et al., 1984) . As the mite can produce significant destructive pulmonary pathology and render animals susceptible to secondary pulmonary bacterial infections, it can disrupt or confound the interpretation of toxicity studies performed in primates. The lesions are located most frequently in cranial lobes and are characterised by the presence of bullae distending the pleural surface, parenchymal cysts, nodules and scar (Joseph et al., 1984; Kim, 1988) . Histologically, there is a wide range of inflammatory activity. Fully developed lesions are characterised by granulomatous bronchiolitis and peribronchiolitis with involvement of immediately adjacent alveoli. Cystic lesions involving the bronchiolar walls develop around the parasites giving rise to the appearance of walled-off cysts composed of highly cellular granulation tissue, associated with neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, multinucleated giant cells and various pigments (see below). In less active lesions, dilated, cystic airways with walls composed of thick bands of smooth muscle and lined by squamous or cuboidal epithelium are found (Joseph et al., 1984) .",

Twenty-eight days following intravenous injection of BCG, the lungs of C57B1/6 mice contained numerous granulomas composed of histiocytes and round cells which were surrounded by alveoli with thickened walls and associated with mild interstitial pneumonitis (Takizawa, 1986) . These histological changes were associated with an increase in the number of Thy 1.2-positive (CD90) cells, especially Lyt-1 (CD5) positive lymphocytes. The histological changes were abrogated by treatment with cyclosporin A, suggesting an important role for CD5-positive lymphocytes in the development of the granulomas.",

Large granulomas rapidly developed in the pulmonary parenchyma around dextran particles that subsequently regressed quite quickly, whereas latex particles produced small, discrete stable granulomas (Allred et al., 1985) . Although both forms of granulomas were of foreign body or non-immunological in type, those produced by dextran but not latex beads, were associated with anergy-like immunosuppression probably caused by release of soluble factors from the granulomas.",

Regardless of the inciting agent or agents, the fibrogenic process appears to be generally characterised by disruption of normal the alveolar-capillary structure, leakage of exudate from the vascular compartment into the airspaces, with subsequent invasion by inflammatory cells and fibroblasts and excess matrix formation. Studies in laboratory animals with different fibrogenic agents as well as in humans have suggested that central to pulmonary fibrogenesis is increased production of tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) by macrophages (Phan and Kunkel, 1992; Driscoll et al., 1994; Piguet and Vesin, 1994; Warheit et al., 1995; Uhl et al., 1998) . This cytokine is a not only a mitogen for fibroblasts but also a potent activator and chemoattractant for macrophages, capable of stimulating release of other cytokines and inducing expression of adhesion molecule expression on endothelial cells (Derynck, 1992; Warheit et al., 1995; Uhl et al., 1998) . Moreover, it has been shown that TNF-\u03b1 receptor knockout mice appear protected from the fibroproliferative effects of inhaled asbestos (Liu et al., 1998) Pulmonary fibrosis is a common sequel of chronic lower respiratory tract inflammation. It may be associated with, or preceded by interstitial pneumonitis, characterised by infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages with scattered polymorphonuclear cells (Singer et al., 1986) . Focal pulmonary fibrosis occurs spontaneously in laboratory animals, although this is usually most prevalent in dogs and non-human primates as a response to chronic infestation by parasites which are not easily eliminated during breeding.",

The lesions were situated predominantly in the pleural and subpleural zones, suggestive of a potentiating effect of friction between the pleural surfaces. Histologically the lesions resembled those produced by larvae migrans in the dog. Similar histological changes have also been described in both rats and mice treated with bleomycin by both the intravenous and intratracheal route (Thrall et al., 1979; Lindenschmidt et al., 1986) . As fibrosis is such a consistent change, bleomycin-treated rodents have been extensively employed as a model for pulmonary fibrosis. Early changes include mild, diffuse increase in interstitial lymphocytes, macrophages, a few polymorphonuclear cells and perivascular or interstitial oedema. After about a week, interstitial infiltrates also comprise fibroblasts with early collagen deposition, associated with proliferation of macrophages and type II pneumocytes (Thrall et al., 1979; Lindenschmidt et al., 1986) . Subsequently, the amount of interstitial collagen increases, with eventual scarring and collapse of lung tissue in proportion to the cumulative dose given (Brown et al., 1988) . Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural study of rats and mice treated with bleomycin shows large accumulation of immune-reactive laminin and reduplication of the basement lamina within the thickened alveolar walls (Singer et al., 1986) .",

Elastase enters the alveolar wall via type I pneumocytes and spreads through the lung interstitium producing degradation of elastin fibres with associated oedema and cellular exudate. Elastase then enters the blood where it is inactivated and cleared by the pulmonary circulation. Eventually the alveolar exudate clears and air space enlargement occurs (See review Snider et al., 1986) .

Generalised accumulation of lysosomal cytoplasmic bodies is generally called phospholipidosis, a term coined to describe the tissue accumulation of phospholipids (Shikata et al., 1972) . A number of workers have reviewed the drugs that cause phospholipidosis in laboratory animals (L\u00fcllmann et al., 1975; Reasor, 1981; Hollinger, 1993; Halliwell, 1997) . Inducing agents are of quite different therapeutic classes but they usually share structural features including a hydrophilic cationic side chain, a primary, secondary or tertiary amine and a hydrophobic region that is usually an aromatic ring or ring system. As this structural pattern renders these molecules amphiphilic, these drugs probably bind with polar lipids by means of electrostatic and hydrophobic forces (L\u00fcllmann et al., 1975) . This leads to formation of drug-lipid complexes which are poorly degraded by lysosomal enzymes and which accumulate in the cell cytoplasm to form the inclusions described above. As the binding is not covalent, its reversibility depends on the dissociation rate constant under the particular intracellular conditions and drug concentration achieved.",

This correlation has been less good when whole animal data are evaluated, presumably because of differences in drug disposition in blood and tissues. Actual examples include the anorectic drug, chlorphentermine, tricyclic antidepressants, inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis such as triparanol, the antihistamine, chlorcyclizine and its analogues and the antioestrogen, tamoxifen, chloroquine, the cardiovascular drugs amiodarone, 4, 4'-diethylamino-ethoxyhexestrol and perhexiline (L\u00fcllmann et al., 1975; L\u00fcllmann and L\u00fcllmann-Rauch, 1981; L\u00fcllmann-Rauch, 1979) . Many tissues and organs may develop the cytoplasmic inclusions including lymphoid cells, liver, pancreas, endocrine tissue, nervous system, muscle cells, eyes and particularly lungs. The lungs appear especially vulnerable to drug-induced phospholipidosis, possibly because macrophages are in very close proximity to blood-borne agents (Reasor, 1981) . The continuous uptake of phospholipid-rich surfactant material from the alveoli by macrophages leads to excessive accumulation of phospholipids when their catabolism is impaired (L\u00fcllmann et al., 1975) . The fact that lungs are commonly affected is a potentially useful diagnostic feature because in many organs phospholipidosis can be extremely difficult to recognise by light microscopy of haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. Although the changes in the lungs are not specific for drug-induced phospholipidosis, an increase in the number of lipid-contain lung macrophages in treated animals compared with controls is relatively easy to detect and provides a simple way for the pathologist to screen for this effect.",

It was argued that group differences did not indicate tumorigenic potential of tilidine fumarate on the basis that the incidence in the high dose group was within the historical control range (27%) and that there was no tumorigenic effect evidence in an analogous 104-week rat carcinogenicity study.",

Roe (1983) argued that the risk to man was slight because the increase in prevalence in pulmonary tumours was likely to be a result of changes in nutritional status of the mice through the effect of metronidazole on gut flora, as similar differences could occur between ad libitum fed mice and those fed the same but restricted diet. He also suggested that the positive findings in bacterial mutagenesis assays were an inherent part of the antibacterial activity of metronidazole as a result of nitroreduction that does not occur in normal mammalian tissues. This conclusion was supported by negative effects in hamster carcinogenicity bioassays and supplemental genotoxicity tests as well as lack of excess cancer risk in women followed up for 10 years or more (Roe, 1983) .",

This followed the demonstration that administration of carcinogens such as 3-methylcholanthrene to this strain could significantly increase the incidence of pulmonary adenomas within periods of up to 6 months (Shimkin, 1940) . Over many years the strain A mouse pulmonary tumour assay has been used to test a large number of chemicals of different classes including polycyclic hydrocarbons, nitrosamines, food additives, alkyl halides, metals and chemotherapeutic agents (Stoner et al., 1973; Gunning et al., 1991) . However, as with many biological systems, interlaboratory agreement in the strain A test system and correlation with 2-year carcinogenicity study data and genotoxicity results have been shown to be poor, so particular care is needed in the interpretation of this test (Maronpot et al., 1986) . Nevertheless, it may serve to help in the ranking of tumorigenic activity of some anticancer drugs provided cognisance is given to drug stability, route of administration and vehicle as well as species differences in metabolism and drug disposition.",
