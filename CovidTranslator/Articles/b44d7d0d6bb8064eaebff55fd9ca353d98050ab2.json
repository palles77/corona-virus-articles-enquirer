However, aspects related to the health profile of the heifer calves that arrive in the rearing unit as well as about biosecurity practices and microbiological challenges have not yet been evaluated in this rearing system in a tropical country. Diarrhea is the main and most frequent consequence of enteric infections in newborn calves. This study, through some etiological and epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of neonatal diarrhea, has the aim to alert to the possibility of pathogenic microorganism spread in a dairy heifer calf rearing unit. The diarrhea outbreak presented some non-regular characteristics observed in bovine coronavirus (BCoV) enteric infections in dairy calves. The spread of infection was extremely rapid (1 week); the attack rate (> 50%) was much higher than that observed in calves subjected to conventional rearing; and the age range (5 to 90 days) of the affected heifer calves was much broader than that often observed in the BCoV diarrhea worldwide. These unusual epidemiological characteristics observed in this BCoV diarrhea outbreak raise awareness of the health threat present in calf rearing units as well as of the easy and rapid viral spread in a population of young animals from different dairy herds and, therefore, with very distinct immunological status.",

The rearing unit consists of 5 barns (5 m \u00d7 3 m) containing 20 to 25 heifer calves per barn. The animals are housed until 60 days of age and subsequently placed in pickets located near the barns where they remained from weaning period until the breeding by artificial insemination. This calf rearing unit receives Holstein female calves and crossed Holstein breed up 5 days old from 42 small dairy farms. Until weaning, the calves are fed calf milk replacer. Besides the compulsory control of brucellosis and tuberculosis and vaccination against foot and mouth disease, the health profile of each small dairy farming was unknown. However, vaccination of cows at the end of gestation to control neonatal calf diarrhea was not performed by any of the dairy herds. Additionally, the colostrum quantity, quality, and immune passive transfer were not monitored at the original 42 small dairy farms. Thus, dairy heifer calves with possible distinct immunological and health status were housed together in the same rearing unit. The dairy calf rearing unit has been regularly operating at 18 months. During this period, the average rate of diarrhea episodes varied from 17 to 22%, with the highest frequency of occurrence in calves between 2 and 3 weeks old.",
