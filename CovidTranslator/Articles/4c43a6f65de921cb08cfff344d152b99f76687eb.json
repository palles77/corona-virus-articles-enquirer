            "text": "The different bovine coronavirus (BCoV) strains or isolates exhibited various degrees of substitutions, resulting in altered antigenicity and pathogenicity of the virus. In the previous our study, we demonstrated that the spike glycoprotein gene of Korean winter dysentery (WD) BCoV had a genetic property of both enteric (EBCV) and respiratory BCoV (RBCV) and were significantly distinct from the ancestral enteric strains. In the present study, therefore, we analyzed the other structure genes, the hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) protein, the transmembrane (M) protein and the small membrane (E) protein to characterize 10 WD BCoV circulated in Korea during 2002-2003 and compared the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences with the other known BCoV. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the HE gene among BCoV could be divided into three groups. The first group included only RBCV, while the second group contained calf diarrhea BCoV, RBCV, WD and EBCV, respectively. The third group possessed only all Korean WD strains which were more homologous to each other and were sharply distinct from the other known BCoV, suggesting Korean WD strains had evolutionary distinct pathway. In contrast, the relative conservation of the M and E proteins of BCoV including Korean WD strains and the other coronaviruses suggested that structural constraints on these proteins are rigid, resulting in more limited evolution of these proteins. In addition, BCoV and human coronavirus HCV-OC43 contained four potential O-glycosylation sites in the M gene. However, the M gene sequence of both BCoV and HCV-OC43 might not contain a signal peptide, suggesting the M protein might be unlikely to be exposed to the O-glycosylation machinery in vivo.",

The genome consists of a single molecule of positive-sense, non-segmented RNA, 30 kb in length, which is transcribed into a nested set of several 3\u00a2-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs for the production of structural and non-structural proteins [7, 8] . The virion contains five major structural proteins; the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the transmembrane (M) protein, the small membrane (E) protein, the hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) protein and the spike (S) protein [9] .",

Recently, we have shown that the WD strains circulated in Korea had a genetic property of both respiratory BCoV (RBCV) and enteric BCoV (EBCV) and were significantly distinct from the ancestral enteric strain [23] . These results prompted us to investigate whether the other structural genes of Korean WD strains have distinctive genetic property compared to those of the other known BCoV. We report here the complete nucleotide sequences of the HE, M, and E genes of WD BCoV circulated in Korea during [2002] [2003] and their phylogenetic relatedness to other known BCoV.",

Therefore, mutations of BCoV genes have been associated with altered antigenicity and pathogenicity of the virus [30, 31] . Furthermore, genetic differences between RBCV and EBCV and virulent and avirulent strains were identified especially within the S gene [17, 18] . We have also identified genetic differences between RBCV, CD, and WD strains [19] . To identify a phylogenetic characterization among the other known BCoV and Korean WD strains, we compared the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of HE, M and E genes. The phylogenetic data of the HE protein indicated that Korean WD strains were more homologous to each other and were sharply distinct from the other known BCoV, suggesting Korean WD strains had evolutionary distinct pathway. This is also supported by our previous results in which S protein of all Korean WD strains had distinct genetic property in comparison with that of the other BCoV [23] . Besides, the S protein of all Korean WD strains revealed a genetic property of both RBCV and EBCV. However, HE protein of these strains did not showed a genetic property of both RBCV and EBCV. Since HE gene is known to be derived by a recombination between an HE mRNA of influenza C virus and the genomic RNA of an ancestral coronavirus and is not absolutely necessary for virus infection [31] , these may result in lower evolutional pressure to HE gene than S gene of BCoV. In addition, the relative conservation of the M and E proteins of all coronaviruses including BCoV suggests that structural constraints on these proteins are rigid, resulting in more limited evolution of these proteins.",

The most striking example of the biologic importance of coronavirus mutants is the emergence of porcine respiratory coronavirus from transmissible gastroenteritis virus [33, 34] . BCoV causes variable clinical signs; calf diarrhea, WD in adult cattle and respiratory infection in feedlot cattle [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Therefore, bovine coronavirologists tried to find genetic characterization of BCoV responsible for their clinical signs. Chouljenko et al. [17] reported that RBCV-and EBCV-specific aa substitutions in the S, HE, M and N genes, respectively, can be predictive. Likewise Mabsspecific strains for these regions may also be distinguished among respiratory, enteric, and vaccine BCoV strains [17] . In our resent results, however, these substitutions in the S gene of BCoV were also detected in all Korean WD strains, suggesting these aa substitutions does not appear to be a potential marker of respiratory or enteric tropisms [23] . In the present study, the aa substitutions at aa 5 (L fi P) and aa 367 (S fi P), and aa 66 (D fi G) in HE gene of all Korean WD strains were identical with that believed to be specific for enteric and respiratory tropisms, respectively. Therefore, this result can support our statement that they may not be RBCV-and EBCV-specific aa substitutions. In contrast, putative virulent-specific sites are all conserved in Korean WD strains with those of the other virulent strains but not in the avirulent Mebus and L9 strains, implying Korean WD strains are virulent [17, 21] .",

In contrast, six potential O-glycosylation sites have been detected in M gene of HCV-OC43 and BCoV [28] . However, only four aa sites among them could be defined as potential O-glycosylation sites by the analysis of NetOGlyc 3.1 Sever program at Technical University of Denmark. Moreover, this program indicated that M gene sequence of both BCoV and HCV-OC43 might not contain a signal peptide. Therefore, proteins without signal peptides are unlikely to be exposed to the O-glycosylation machinery and thus may not be glycosylated in vivo even though they contain potential motifs. Further study will be needed on in vivo O-glycosylation machinery in MHV, HCV-OC43 and BCoV.

Subsequently, 44 ll of the RT-PCR mixture was added. The RT-PCR mixture consisted of 5 ll of 10\u00b7 buffer [100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 500 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl 2 , 0.01% gelatin), 5 ll of MgCl 2 (25 mM), 1 ll of 10 mM dNTPs, 1 l1 of the upstream primer (50 pmol), 1 ll of the downstream primer (50 pmol), 0.5 ll of RNAsin (Promega Corporation), and 0.5 ll of AMV RT (Promega Corporation), 0.5 ll of Taq polymerase (Promega Corporation) (5 U/ll). The mixture was incubated for 60 min at 42\u00b0C, preheated for 5 min at 94\u00b0C, and subjected to 35 cycles of PCR. The PCR products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide.DNA sequencingThe RT-PCR products were purified using a GenClean II kit (BIO 101, Inc., LaJolla, CA) according to the manufacture's instructions. The DNA sequencing was done using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI system 3700, Applied Biosystem Inc., Foster City, CA).Using the DNA Basic module (DNAsis MAX, Alameda, CA), nucleotide sequences of our BCoV isolates were first compared for the HE sequence of BCoV as follows: the CD strains including Mebus (GenBank accession No.AAA66393), L9 (GenBank accession No. AAB20434), BCQ571 (GenBank accession No. AAA92991), BCQ1523 (GenBank accession No. AAG40600), BCQ3708 (Gen-Bank accession No. AAG40593), and BCQ701 (GenBank accession No. AAG40592), the WD strains including BCQ7373 (GenBank accession No. AAG40594) and BCQ2590 (GenBank accession No. AAA92989), the RBCV strains including BCQ3994 (GenBank accession No. AAK14397), LSU (GenBank accession No. AAF25508), OK (GenBank accession No. AAF25518), LUN (GenBank accession No AAL57307), BC043277 (GenBank accession No. AAG60544) and BC044175 (AAG40622), EBCV strains including LY-138 (GenBank accession No. AAF25498) and ENT (GenBank accession No. AAK83355). The M gene sequence compared were as follows: Mebus (GenBank accession No. AAK29779), LY-138 (GenBank accession No. AAF25504), ENT (GenBank accession No. AAK83361), LSU (GenBank accession No. AAF25514), OK (GenBank accession No. AAF25524) and LUN (GenBank accession No. AAL57312). The E gene sequence compared were Mebus (GenBank accession No AAA42914), BCQ571 (GenBank accession No. accession No. AAF25513), OK (GenBank accession No. AAF25523) and LUN (GenBank accession No. AAL57311). The deduced amino acid (aa) sequences were then assembled and analyzed on the Amino Acid Basic module (DNAsis MAX, Alameda, CA). A sequence similarity search was performed for the BCoV HE, M and E protein using the LALIGN Query program of the GENESTREAM network server at Institute de G\u00e9n\u00e9tque Humaine.
