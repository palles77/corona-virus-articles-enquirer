This disease was designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the pathogen was identiWed as a novel coronavirus, named SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2] [3] [4] . The SARS-CoV is a single-stranded plus-sense RNA virus with a genome of about 30 kb in length that has a 5\u0408 cap structure and a 3\u0408 polyadenylation tail. Upon infection of an appropriate host cell, the 5\u0408-most open-reading frame (ORF) of the viral genome is translated into a large polyprotein that is cleaved by proteases to release several nonstructural proteins (nsps), including nsp2 (3C-like proteinase), nsp9 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp), nsp10 (NTPase/HEL), and so on [5, 6] . Among these nsps, the nsp13 protein has been predicted as an mRNA cap 1 methyltransferase by 3D jury system [7] .",

            "text": "Methylated 5\u0408-terminal cap structures have been described in most eukaryotic and many viral mRNAs. The methylated cap structure is essential for eYcient initiation of translation and mRNA stability [8] . In all cap structures, including the \"minimal\" cap 0 (m7G(5\u0408) ppp(5\u0408)N), an N7methylguanosine (m7G) is attached through a 5\u0408-5\u0408 triphosphate bridge to the penultimate nucleoside. In some molecules, additional 2\u0408-O-ribose methylations are found at the penultimate and the antepenultimate nucleosides, forming the cap 1 (m7G(5\u0408)ppp(5\u0408)Nm) and cap 2 (m7G(5\u0408)ppp(5\u0408)NmpNm) structures, respectively [9, 10] . The enzyme that catalyzes the cap 1 structure is a (nucleoside-2\u0408-O-)-methyltransferase (2\u0408-O-MTase), which usually utilizes S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) as the methyl donor. The SARS-nsp13 protein belongs to the ancient family of AdoMet-dependent ribose 2\u0408-O-MTase. The enzymatic role of the protein was conWrmed by the presence of the conserved tetrad of residues K-D-K-E essential for mRNA cap 1 formation [7] .",

Viruses with cytoplamic replication cycle have to synthesize their 5\u0408terminal cap structures with their own methyltransferases. The order of methyl transfer reactions is variable, in some viruses the cap 0 structure is necessary for cap 1 methylation [10] , and in other viruses the cap 1 is a preferred substrate for the cap 0 MTase [11, 12] . So viral cap-forming enzymes (cap 0 and/or cap 1) are potential targets for antiviral drugs that would interfere with capping of pathogen mRNAs but spare the host capping enzymes. Exploring the structure and function of the SARS-CoV nsp13 protein will be extremely useful for the development of anti-SARS agents.",
