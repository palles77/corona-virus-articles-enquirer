The exhaled leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light sheet and images captured by high-de6nition video. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke and droplet particles. Finding.: The maximum dispenion distance of smoke particles through the nebulizer side vent was 0.45 m lateral to the HPS at normal lung condition (oxygen consumption, 200 mUmin; lung compliance, 70 mUcm H.O), but it increased to 0.54 m in mild lung injury (oxygen consumption, 300 mUmin; lung compliance, 35 mUcm H.O), and beyond 0.8 m in severe lung injury (oxygen consumption, 500 mUmin; lung compliance, 10 mUcm H.O). More extensive leakage through the side vents of the nebulizer mask was noted with more severe lung injury. Interpretation: Health-care worken should take extra protective precaution within at least 0.8 m from patients with febrile respiratory illness of unknown etiology receiving treatment via a jet nebulizer even in an isolation room with negative pressure.

There is a strong association between ventilation, environmental air movements, and the airborne transmission of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).4 Since respiratory therapy may generate infective aerosols, there is potential risk that treatment may result in a superspreading event among patients and health-care workers in close contact. The use of a jet nebulizer driven by air at 6 Umin for the administration of aerosolized salbutamol in an index patient had probably enhanced the spread of SARS, leading to a major nosocomial outbreak in our hospital in 2003. 5--7 We have reported the dispersion distances of exhaled air, as marked by smoke particles, during application of oxygen therapy via a simple mask and during noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV).Il-1O As part of our influenza pandemic preparedness, we studied dispersion distances of exhaled air and aerosolized droplets during application of a jet nebulizer to a human patient simulator (HPS) programmed to breathe at normal lung condition and at different degrees of lung injury.

The leakage plume of \"unused\" aerosolized medications from the jet nebulizer should also be considered as infective because it mixeswith the exhaled air before it escapes through the side vents of the nebulizer mask. As the smoke particles mark air that originates from the HPS airways, before leaking from the mask, the concentration contours effectively represent the probability of encountering exhaled air and the aerosolizedmedication around the patient that has come from within the mask and/or the patient's respiratory system.

Bottom lett: The simulator was programmed to mimic mild lung injury with oxygen consumption of 300 mUmin, lung compliance of 35 mUcm H 20, respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min, and tidal volume of 300 mL.

DISCUSSION With an extremely fine smoke particle tracer in order to demonstrate the maximum distribution of exhaled air, this study investigated the dispersion distances of exhaled air particles during application of a jet nebulizer under normal lung condition vs www.chestjoumal.org different degrees of lung injury in our hospital isolation room with negative pressure. Using laser smoke visualizationmethods, we have shown that the maximum dispersion distance of a low concentration of air particles increased from 0.45 m at normal lung condition to 0.54 m and beyond 0.8 m during mild and severe lung injury, respectively. Interestingly, the dispersion of high-concentration smoke particles was reduced with worsening lung injury. These data suggest that the dispersion of exhaled air during application of jet nebulizer is determined by both the CHEST /135/3/ MARCH, 2009 expiratory effort and the leakage of \"unused\" aerosolized droplets through the exhalation ports of the jet nebulizer. In this regard, exhaled air from the lungs contained high concentration of smoke particles and was dispersed according to expiratory flow. Therefore, the dispersion distance of high-concentration smoke particles was significantly reduced by > 40% as the tidal volume was decreased from 700 to 150 mL. In contrast, the extent of leakage ofaerosolized droplets was inversely proportional to the tidal volume. Although aerosol deposition within the simulated patient does not model deposition within a real lung, much of the aerosolized medication was deposited within the simulated patient during inspiration, and the amount of leakage was therefore less in normal lung condition than in the severe lung injury model. Although the leakage of aerosolized droplets carried only small amount of exhaled smoke particles, these were responsible for dispersing Iowconcentration smoke particles to a longer distance in severe lung injury. These findings have important clinical implications to the hea1th-care workers who often manage patients with respiratory failure and febrile illness of unknown etiology at a close distance. It is important to provide adequate respiratory protection for health-care workers in addition to applying standard, contact, and droplet precautions in order to prevent nosocomial infections.",

In a stud y 27 of the dispersion characteristics of polydispersed droplets in a general hospital ward equipped with ceilingmixing type ventilation system, the small droplets or droplet nuclei (initial size S 45 J.Lm) behaved as airborne transmittable particles (staying airborne for > 360 s) and the dispersions were strongly affected by the ward ventilation airflow pattern.

However, evaporation of water content in some respiratory droplets during the jet nebulizer therapy would produce droplet nuclei suspended in air, whereas the larger droplets would fall to the ground in a trajectory pathway due to gravitational effects.

In addition to maintaining contact, droplet, and standard precautions among the health-care workers when providing routine care to patients infected with H5Nl influenza, the World Health Organization 28 currently recommends airborne precautions in health-care facilities, including placing patients with suspected and confirmed H5Nl influenza in isolation rooms with at least 12 air exchanges per hour (if available) during aerosol-generating procedures due to the high lethality of the disease and uncertainty about the mode of human-to-human transmission. The negative pressure room will reduce the spread of airborne contamination between rooms. The air-exchange rate and airflow patterns are important factors in the control of airborne virus infection, and good ventilation arrangement may enhance the safety of staff when performing medical treatments within isolation rooms.P? In health-care facilities where negative pressure isolation room is not available, an alternative is to administer bronchodilator to high-risk patients in the form of a metered-dose inhaler via a spacer or in dry powder formulation because these methods have equivalent efficacy to the jet nebulizer in relieving bronchospasm due to acute asthma.
