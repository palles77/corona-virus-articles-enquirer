One month into the outbreak, many people were still not working or exercising as usual, which may have associated implications on health and wellbeing. Yet, the implications of the unusually prolonged state of not working and exercising on individuals' health and wellbeing remain unknown. It is important to understand not only the implications of the restrictions on COVID-19 disease prevalence rates but also the implications of such unprecedented disruptions on the health and wellbeing of the community (Brooks et al., 2020) . From a policy perspective, understanding the health and wellbeing of people under the varying degrees of lockdown in China has implications for countries that are just starting to fight coronavirus, as such restrictions started in Korea, Italy, parts of the US, etc. in March (Moodie Davitt Report, 2020).",

Other prefectures (the administrative areas of a city) in China subsequently implemented varying levels of restrictive measures.
