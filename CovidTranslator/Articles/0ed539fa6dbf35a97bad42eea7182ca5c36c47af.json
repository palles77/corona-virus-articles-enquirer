            "text": "whole-virus-based immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was considered one of the most sensitive assays and served as a \"gold standard\" during the SARS epidemic in Singapore in 2003. However, the need to manipulate live SARS-CoV in the traditional IFA limits its wide application due to the requirement for a biosafety level 3 laboratory and the risk of laboratory infection. Previously, we have identified two immunodominant epitopes, named N195 and Sc, in the two major structural proteins, the N and S proteins, of SARS-CoV (Q. He, K. ). In the present study, the N195-Sc fusion protein was highly expressed in insect (Sf9) cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus bearing the hybrid gene under the control of a polyhedrin promoter. An IFA based on Sf9 cells producing the fusion protein was standardized with 23 serum samples from patients with SARS, 20 serum samples from patients with autoimmune diseases, and 43 serum samples from healthy blood donors. The detection rates were comparable to those obtained with a commercial SARS-CoV IFA kit (EUROIMMUN, Gross Groenau, Germany) and a conventional IFA performed at the Singapore General Hospital. Our data showed that the newly developed IFA could detect SARS-CoV in 22 of the 23 SARS-CoV-positive serum samples and gave no false-positive results when the sera from patients with autoimmune diseases and healthy individuals were tested. The detection rate was identical to those of the two whole-virus-based IFAs. Thus, the novel N-S fusion antigen-based IFA could be an attractive alternative to present whole-virus-based IFAs for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection.",

The recombinant protein-based Western blot assay showed a high antibody detection rate (3, 5) . However, this method is labor-intensive and time-consuming, as the methods involved protein expression and purification. At present, IFA is regarded as the \"gold standard\" for the detection of SARS-CoV infection. However, it involves the hazardous work of virus cultivation in a BSL-3 laboratory. To explore a sensitive assay which does not involve the manipulation of live SARS-CoV, we developed an IFA using the Spodoptera frugiperda insect cell line Sf9 and a recombinant baculovirus to express the N195-Sc fusion protein as the antigen for the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV. In this fusion protein-based IFA technique, no crossreaction with other coronavirus-infected sera was found. The specificity and sensitivity of our novel IFA were assessed with a panel of serum samples comprising 23 serum samples positive for SARS-CoV, 20 serum samples from patients with autoimmune diseases, and 43 serum samples from healthy individuals. The results were compared to those obtained by two other whole-virus-based IFAs, a commercial SARS-CoV IFA kit (EUROIMMUN, Gross Groenau, Germany) and the conventional IFA (performed in a BSL-3 laboratory at the Singapore General Hospital), as well as our N195-based Western blotting assay.",

The diagnostic methods available at present include sequence detection by RT-PCR and real-time PCR, virus isolation, and serological tests. IFA is used to detect specific antibody produced after infection and has been considered by the World Health Organization to be the gold standard for the detection of SARS-CoV infection. Nevertheless, because of the high degree of pathogenicity and infectivity of SARS-CoV for humans, performance of virus cultivation is restricted to BSL-3 laboratories, making it inconvenient and hazardous for antigen production. The safety issue has become of even more paramount importance after two recent SARS cases in Singapore and Taiwan were found to be associated with inadequate laboratory safety procedures. This leads to more serious concerns about the possibility of live SARS-CoV leakage from the laboratory, which could become a source of another SARS outbreak. Therefore, it becomes extremely important for investigators to use extra precautions while handling SARS-CoV and preparing the antigen so that these procedures can be performed in a safer manner.",

To confirm the loyalty of the fusion protein expressed in Sf9 cells, which was supposed to be used in the novel IFA, the purified recombinant truncated N195 protein and the Sc protein, which were expressed in E. coli, were used to immunize guinea pigs to raise polyclonal antibodies against the two proteins. The reactivities of the two antisera with the fusion protein expressed in Sf9 cells in total cell lysates by Western blotting and the infected Sf9 cell-based IFA technique indicated the successful expression of the target N195 and Sc proteins. Furthermore, both polyclonal antibodies also reacted with the native antigens in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells. The same reaction patterns were observed in the fusion protein-based IFA and whole-virus-based IFA, which showed that the baculovirusexpressed N195 and Sc proteins had functional antigenicities equal to those of their authentic counterparts in SARS-CoV, strongly supporting the diagnostic potential of the fusion protein in the development of a new assay.",

The baculovirus expression system has been widely applied to express abundant heterologous genes in cultured insect cells; and in most cases, the recombinant protein is processed, modified, and targeted to its appropriate cellular locations, where it functions like its native counterparts. To use this advantage, we constructed recombinant baculoviruses expressing the N195 protein and the N195-Sc protein and infected Sf9 cells with the recombinant baculoviruses to develop a safer IFA. When the sensitivity of the N195-based IFA was compared with that of the N195-Scbased IFA, no significant difference regarding IgG detection was observed, but higher levels of IgM detection and stronger positive signals were observed by the N195-Sc-based IFA (data not shown). Moreover, the N195-Sc fusion protein was found to be a soluble protein and, thus, could be purified more easily, implying that the N195-Sc fusion protein also has potential for use in the development of an ELISA. Therefore, the recom- Time course analyses by both Western blotting and IFA showed that protein expression in Sf9 cells could not be detected prior to 12 h postinfection. A very weak signal of the expressed protein could be observed only at 24 h postinfection. The peak level of protein expression was achieved at 36 h postinfection, at which time it could be detected strongly by both Western blotting and IFA. No significant increment in protein expression could be found after 36 h postinfection. In addition, after 36 h postinfection, more Sf9 cells lysed and changed morphologically, leading to the higher possibility of false-positive results as a result of unspecific fluorescence staining, which was also reported for the IFA for the detection of Ebola virus infection (8) .",

Thus, the accuracy and sensitivity of SARS-CoV detection were increased by our novel IFA. On the other hand, the identical detection rates between our novel IFA and the commercial whole-virus-based IFA kit suggest that immunogenicity is enhanced by fusion of the N195 and Sc proteins and that the diagnostic ability of the assay with the fusion protein is identical to that of the assay with whole virus (authentic antigen). The commercial IFA kit (EUROIMMUN) is based on the use of whole SARS-CoVinfected Vero cells which had been treated with a disinfecting fixing agent and gamma irradiation; thus, the cells still maintained the authentic antigens of SARS-CoV. However, one sample (sample 5-32) was found to be negative by all four tests.
