The objectives of this study were to compare the impact of using mPCR vs non-mPCR testing for respiratory pathogens at hospital admission on the utilization of healthcare resources for pediatric inpatients as measured by duration of inpatient antibiotic therapy, chest radiograph use on admission, and duration of isolation precautions. We hypothesized that using mPCR testing at admission would decrease use of antibiotics and chest radiographs, and increase the use of isolation precautions compared with these outcomes when using non-mPCR testing.",

Non-mPCR testing included enzyme immunoassay for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), direct fluorescent antigen for parainfluenza and adenovirus, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for influenza and RSV, and/or viral cultures, with a turnaround time of 2-5 days. These assays often were performed sequentially (eg, PCR testing was performed first followed by direct fluorescent antigen and/or culture if PCR results were negative). Mycoplasma (serology and PCR sent to a commercial laboratory) and Bordetella pertussis (culture and PCR sent to a commercial laboratory) testing were offered in the non-mPCR period but were not included in this analysis because results usually were not available within 48 hours and, hence, would less likely influence clinical decisions made during this period. Subjects hospitalized between October 2012 and May 2014 were tested with mPCR methods. Testing used the Food and Drug Administration-approved mPCR Film Array Respiratory panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc, Salt Lake City, Utah), 9 which identifies adenovirus, coronavirus (strains HKU1, NL63, 229E, OC43); human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus; influenza (strains A, A/H1, A/H3, A/H1-2009, B); parainfluenza virus (strains 1, 2, 3, 4); and RSV as well as the bacterial respiratory pathogens Mycoplasma, B pertussis, and Chlamydophilia. This panel has high sensitivity (85%-100%), specificity (95%-100%), and at our institution a turnaround time of approximately 3 hours from order entry to results being viewed by providers. 9, 10 Hospitalizations from July to September 2012 were excluded to allow providers to become familiar with mPCR testing.",

We compared overall antibiotic and isolation utilization rates for mPCR and Volume 173 June 2016 non-mPCR groups (calculated as summed number of antibiotic or isolation days divided by summed patient days) using the Fisher exact test. In addition, to assess if secular trends in antibiotic use could confound any observed association between antibiotic use and respiratory pathogen testing, we used data from PHIS to determine days of antibiotic use for patients with primary ICD-9 diagnoses of acute gastroenteritis, which are community-acquired diagnoses not diagnosed by the respiratory viral panel.",

These results expand on previous work assessing the impact of mPCR based testing in pediatric settings. These studies have shown a decrease in antibiotic use after introduction of mPCR testing 4 ; and shorter duration of antibiotic therapy for those with positive tests and common respiratory diagnoses, 8 or those cared for by specific admitting services. 6 The impact of mPCR testing in other clinical settings has been inconsistent; use of rapid viral testing has shown little impact on antibiotic use in ambulatory and emergency department settings. 2, 7 This heterogeneity in findings could indicate that provider decisions for antibiotic use in the emergency department or ambulatory setting may be more impacted by clinical factors (eg, physical examination or past medical history) and less impacted by mPCR test results. In addition, in these settings, decisions are made within shorter time frames, and despite the relatively rapid turnaround time for mPCR testing, results may still not be timely enough to impact decision making. Furthermore, inpatient providers may benefit from a longer period of observation and serial clinical examinations to verify and validate results from diagnostic evaluations, possibly allowing for \"bolder\" decisions to stop antibiotics. We found an association between mPCR testing and decreased use of chest radiographs. We theorize that more rapid and more sensitive identification of viral pathogens could have influenced providers' decisions not to obtain chest radiographs, particularly in patients without complex chronic conditions or clinical features suggestive of bacterial pneumonia. Supporting this, patients with more severe illness requiring a PICU stay or those with complex chronic conditions were more likely to have had a chest radiograph performed.",

In both groups, patients with positive tests received less antibiotics compared with those with negative tests, although the proportions of patients with positive tests who were treated with 2 or more antibiotic days remained high. These results indicate the need for continued antibiotic stewardship activities to avoid unnecessary antibiotic therapy for viral infections. Similarly, patients with positive tests in both groups had higher rates of utilization of chest radiograph compared with patients with negative tests. We speculate this might have been due to more prominent respiratory symptoms in those testing positive. Finally, a higher proportion of patients with positive test results in the mPCR group were isolated for 2 or more days compared with those with negative test results. This observation is not unexpected given the detection of more viral pathogens by mPCR and active surveillance of test results by the Department of Infection Prevention and Control staff to ensure appropriate isolation rather than only relying on front-line clinicians to implement isolation precautions.",

To assess the overall impact of mPCR testing, we included all patients who underwent respiratory testing within the first 2 days of hospitalization and did not restrict the study population to a specific diagnosis (eg, community-acquired pneumonia). We used a combination of EMR and administrative data collected retrospectively, which may have increased the imprecision of our estimates of antibiotic utilization, chest radiograph use, and isolation precautions. However, during the study period, there were no substantial changes to the EMR, or to our hospital's contributions to the PHIS database that should minimize bias. Although we adjusted for likely confounding variables, including seasonal variation, it is possible that other secular trends could have contributed to the differences in antibiotic and chest radiograph use observed over the years of the study. The publication of the pediatric communityacquired pneumonia guidelines and revised guidelines for bronchiolitis during the study period may have impacted individual clinicians' testing and treating practices among patients hospitalized with respiratory symptoms. There has also been increased interest nationally in minimizing radiation exposure in children, which may have influenced provider behavior and, thus, limited use of chest radiographs. However, during the study period, the New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital did not implement substantial changes in antimicrobial stewardship, or other hospital-wide initiatives specifically to reduce the use of antibiotics or radiographs. In addition, the mPCR group had more patients with complex chronic conditions and more patients admitted to the PICU, which would more likely have been associated with an increase in use of antibiotics and imaging. The database does not permit assessment of the provider's interpretation of positive test results relative to causality of the patient's clinical syndrome or appropriateness of antibiotic therapy. Further work should focus on ways to improve decision support to aid in more effective use of mPCR testing by providers. In addition, the effect of mPCR testing on preventing healthcare transmission of viral pathogens should be assessed. n ",
