There are stituations, however, where the author and others have found a porcine cell line origin, modified live virus, NADL strain, BVD vaccine to be safe when used in pregnant dairy cows during the last trimester of gestation, that is, during the dry period. The indication for such use of this vaccine has been a persisting herd problem of weakness and pneumoenteritis with high mortality of neonatal calves involving BVDV and other complicating agents. A licensed vaccine containing the Singer strain of BVDV has been used in a similar way by many veterinarians . Results of such use, i.e., vaccinating pregnant cows and heifers with these BVD vaccines at seven to eight months' gestation, have been very gratifying.

Longer term cross-protective immunity studies have not, however, been done. It is our belief, based on field experience, that homologous strain BVDV immunity is probably of relatively long duration but that heterologous strain immunity wanes by six months to one year. We therefore advocate annual vaccination of dairy cattle, during the open period, about two to three weeks after pa rturition.

The magnitude of the active immune response in this case appears to be inversely proportional to the titer of passive antibodies present. Therefore, in areas where BVD is endemic, BVD vaccination of calves two to four weeks old has been of value in reducing calf morbidity due to BVDV.

Many believe they are important components of the bovine respiratory disease complex, especially when associated with various stresS factors and combined with other infectious agents, such as other viruses, mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, and other bacteria.

As with bovine respiratory diseases, it is likely that single agent infections are the exception rather than the rule. Particularly in situations of poor management, housing, and nutrition of baby calves, the situation is optimal for E. coli, rotaviruses, and coronaviruses to inflict their severest effect. Well-ventilated, dry, uncrowded housing, good sanitation, and adequate nutrition are important ingredients of good management to prevent both respiratory and enteric diseases. It is my opinion that late-term vaccination of pregnant cows with recently available E. coli, K-99 bacterins, and rotavirus/coronavirus combination vaccines, combined with a program assuring early and continuous feeding of colostrum from vaccinated cows to neonatal calves through one month of age, provides the best approach to prevention of calf enteritis. This, of course, assumes that the above other management factors are optimized. The more or less continuous presence of passive antibodies in the gut of young calves, provided by the feeding of colostrum, appears to be the most rational approach for this problem.",
