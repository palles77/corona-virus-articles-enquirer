Whole-cell lysates from Borrelia spp., leptospiral serovars, and Serpulina spp. were used for SDS-PAGE, western blots, and KELA. Crossreactivity occurred between the antibodies to B. burgdorferi and leptospiral serovars when tested on the heterologous antigens. Antibodies to leptospiral serovars tended to cross-react more strongly with antigens of B. burgdorferi spp. than did antibodies to B. burgdorferi when tested against antigens of leptospiral serovars. The antibodies against B. burgdorferi showed a lesser degree of cross-reactivity to the antigens ofS. hyodysenteriae and S. innocens than they did to leptospiral serovars. We conclude that cross-reactivity occurs between B. burgdorferi and leptospiral serovars. Validation and interpretation of ELISA tests for detection of antibody activity to whole cell lysates of the Lyme agent must take this cross-reactivity into consideration. Conversely, dogs infected with the Lyme agent do not show significant cross-reactivity in the microagglutination test for antibody to the leptospiral serovars.",

Wells exposed to carbonate buffer and the washing steps served as background control for each sample.

Serum samples and controls were diluted 1 : 100 in freshly prepared 0.1 M PBST containing 2% nonfat dry milk (Carnation Co., Los Angeles, California) and dispensed ( 100 #1 ) into antigen coated plates in quadruplicate. Plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for one hour and washed with PBST. One hundred #1 of conjugate consisting of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) linked to goat antidog serum (heavy and light chain-specific) was added to each well and incubated for 30 rain at room temperature.

When reacted with Borrelia antigen, antibodies from the leptospiral pool showed dominant bands at approximately 41 kDa, which is consistent with the flagellin antigen, and at 60 kDa, which may reflect a heat shock protein of Borrelia; some other protein bands also were developed by antibody to leptospiral serovars (Fig. 3) . When we tested sera from the Lyme pool against antigens of the leptospiral serovars, two main bands appeared with molecular weight of approximately 32 and 44 kDa, respectively. A smear between 30-18 kDa is probably a carbohydrate; further identification of this substance is necessary.

Activity from 0 to 100 units could not be distinguished from background activity and samples in this range have been considered negative in KELA while antibody activity ranging from 100 to 200 units is considered as low-positive based on western immunoblotring confirmation. From Table 2 , it is clear that antibody to the leptospiral serovars is detected as low positive in the KELA serotest for antibody to B. burgdorferi.

            "text": "Since leptospirosis is an important disease in dogs in the USA, most dogs have received a leptospiral vaccine. Because western blots confirm serological cross-reactions between leptospiral serovars and Borrelia species, they constitute a useful tool in validating the specificity of ELISA tests. Furthermore, since it is not difficult to differentiate between antibodies to the leptospiral serovars and B. burgdorferi in western blots, the technique can be a useful aid in the diagnosis of canine Lyme disease. Because validation of the KELA assay is based on western immunoblotting of sera of known Lyme agent infection status, the cutoff between seropositive and seronegative dogs in the KELA Lyme test is based on objective criteria. The KELA is thus a valuable serotest for the confirmation of canine Lyme disease.",
