No SARS-like coronavirus had been isolated but a novel avian coronavirus strain, Peafowl/GD/KQ6/2003 (KQ6), was identified. Sequence analysis revealed that KQ6 was an avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of coronavirus in group 3. The genome sequence of KQ6 had extremely high degree of identity with that of a Massachusetts prototype IBV M41. KQ6 was pathogenic to chickens but non-pathogenic to peafowls under experimental conditions. Seventeen out of fifty-four (31.48%) peafowl serum samples were tested positive for specific antibodies against IBV. Present results indicate that the peafowl isolate KQ6 is a Massachusetts prototype like coronavirus strain which undergoes few genetic changes and peafowl might have acted as a natural reservoir of IBV for very long time.",

The recently emerging agent for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a new member of coronavirus in group 2. The exact origin of this novel coronavirus is still not clear, but current molecular epidemiological evidence favors an animal origin of the virus (Guan et al., 2003) . So how coronavirus breaks the host species barrier, causes interspecies infection and becomes zoonotic would be interesting questions to be noticed in public. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the prototype member of coronavirus in group 3, which also consists of turkey coronavirus (TCoV), pheasant coronavirus (PhCoV), goose coronavirus (GCoV), duck coronavirus (DCoV) and pigeon coronavirus (PiCoV). Although chickens were believed to be the only natural hosts for IBV, pheasants were also reported to be susceptible to IBV infection (Gough et al., 1996; Spackman and Cameron, 1983) . In addition, it had been described that some galliform birds (guinea fowl, partridge and peafowl) and non-galliform birds (teal) were infected by coronaviruses that were very similar to IBV (Ito et al., 1991; Liu et al., 2005) . Since IBV could infect some birds, there was a high possibility that IBV strains might be transmitted over long distances through the migration.",

No specific PCR products were detected from the rest of examined samples. This isolate from peafowl was named as Peafowl/GD/KQ6/2003 (KQ6). For further understanding of KQ6 strain, biological characteristics of KQ6 were determined systematically. In the HA test, the HA titer of KQ6 was greater than 64, whereas no detectable HA titer was observed in the nontreated control samples, which indicated that trypsinized virus was able to hemaglutinate chicken red blood cells as observed in many other strains of IBVs. In the embryo infection test, all of the embryos showed dwarfism post-infection with the peafowl isolate, losing at least 2 g of body weight compared with the negative controls. This observation clearly demonstrated that KQ6 was able to inhibit the growth of chicken embryos as many other IBV strains did. To further characterize the isolate, the virus interference test was performed. It was found that the reciprocal HA titers of KQ6 + NDV B1 infected eggs were lower than 20, while those infected with NDV B1 only were greater than 256 and no HA titers in PBS inoculated controls, which clearly demonstrated the interference of the isolate to the growth of NDV. Moreover, we performed the neutralization test for further identification of the isolate. It was found that the EID 50 of chicken-anti-IBV serum-treated group was 10 \u22122.7 , while the EID 50 of IBV-antibody-free serum-treated group was 10 \u22124.5 , giving out the neutralization index of 63.09.

If point mutations, insertions, deletions or RNA recombinations occur in the antigenic S protein, the characters of antigen will change and a new type of virus might be born (Jia et al., 1995; Wang et al., 1993 Wang et al., , 1994 . Interestingly, the S1 gene of KQ6 had extremely high degree of identity with that of the Massachusetts prototype IBV, M41, which has undergone countless number of in vivo and in vitro host passages since 1940s. Only 0.4% differences at nucleotide level and 1.1% differences at amino acid level were found in their S1 genes. There were two explanations of their high degree of sequence identity. One was that propensity of frequent mutation was not necessarily intrinsic to all IBV strains, such as the Massachusetts serotype virus. It had been reported that a difference of only 2% in nucleotide sequence and 4% in amino acid sequence was found in the S1 genes of a Massachusetts serotype virus of the 1940s and the present-day Massachusetts prototype M41 strain (Jia et al., 2002) . The other explanation was that IBV in peafowls had not undergone the immune pressure from vaccine like chickens. So the point mutations of IBV in peafowls were much less than those in other species. This high degree of sequence identity showed that KQ6 was a Massachusetts prototype like IBV strain which had undergone few genetic changes.",

No overt disease was observed in chickens that had been inoculated with the first reported peafowl IBV strain LKQ3 (Liu et al., 2005) . In contrast, KQ6 strain was able to cause clinical signs and pathogenic changes in chickens. Severe haemorrhagic lesions, epithelium degeneration and lymphocyte infiltration were observed in both lungs and kidneys of the KQ6 infected chickens. It was possible that the different experiment procedure, different environment and different criterion in the virulence studies might generate different experiment results, but we believed that KQ6 was pathogenic to chickens. Meanwhile, we found that KQ6 was non-pathogenic to peafowls.",

It suggested that peafowl was susceptible to IBV infection and IBVs other than those previously reported in chickens and turkeys might be carried in peafowls causing no clinical sign. Up to date, there has been no more data about IBV infection in peafowls, so the exact origin of peafowl IBV is still not clear. Liu et al. speculated that LKQ3 might originate from the attenuated vaccine strain IBV H120. But peafowls, unlike many other birds on farms, are not immunized with vaccines in China and peafowls in nature are unlikely to be infected by IBV vaccine strain through direct contacting with immunized chickens. So we believed that peafowl was the natural carrier for IBV.",

Our investigations in peafowls indicate that KQ6 is a Massachusetts prototype like coronavirus strain which undergoes few genetic changes and peafowl might have acted as a natural reservoir of IBV for very long time.",
