            "text": "Despite an intensive vaccine program influenza infections remain a major health problem, due to the viruses' ability to change its envelope glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA), through shift and drift, permitting influenza to escape protection induced by current vaccines or natural immunity. Recently a new variant, H7N9, has emerged in China causing global concern. First, there have been more than 130 laboratory-confirmed human infections resulting in an alarmingly high death rate (32.3%). Second, genetic changes found in H7N9 appear to be associated with enabling avian influenza viruses to spread more effectively in mammals, thus transmitting infections on a larger scale. Currently, no vaccines or drugs are effectively able to target H7N9. Here, we report the rapid development of a synthetic consensus DNA vaccine (pH7HA) to elicit potent protective immunity against the H7N9 viruses. We show that pH7HA induces broad antibody responses that bind to divergent HAs from multiple new members of the H7N9 family. These antibody responses result in high-titer HAI against H7N9. Simultaneously, this vaccine induces potent polyfunctional effector CD4 and CD8 T cell memory responses. Animals vaccinated with pH7HA are completely protected from H7N9 virus infection and any morbidity associated with lethal challenge. This study establishes that this synthetic consensus DNA vaccine represents a new tool for targeting emerging infection, and more importantly, its design, testing and development into seed stock for vaccine production in a few days in the pandemic setting has significant implications for the rapid deployment of vaccines protecting against emerging infectious diseases.",

            "text": "In recent decades, both high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) H7 viruses have caused large poultry outbreaks in Italy [1] , the Netherlands [2, 3] , Canada [4] , the United Kingdom [5] , the United States of America [6] , and Mexico [7] . During viral circulation in poultry, with the exception of the 1999 H7N1 outbreak in Italy, these H7 viruses have acquired the ability to be transmitted from poultry to humans and cause disease and mortality [8, 9] . The outbreak of the highly pathogenic H7N7 influenza virus in Netherlands in 2003 resulted in an estimated 450 human cases and one death [3] . The newly emerged Chinese avian influenza A (H7N9) virus is one subgroup among the larger group of H7 viruses [10] . As of July 4 th , 2013, there have been a total of 133 laboratory-confirmed cases and 43 people have died, indicating a very high mortality rate (32.3%) [11] . The H7N9 virus exhibits several genetic features of mammalian influenza viruses, including the specificity of their HA protein binding to mammalian cellular receptors [12, 13] ; a deletion in NA stalk associated with increased virulence in mammals [14] ; and an important mutation in the PB2 protein that is essential for the efficient replication of avian viruses in mammalian species [15] . The efficient transmission of H7N9 virus in ferrets suggested that human-to-human transmission of this virus might be possible under appropriate conditions [16] . As a result, the emergence of the novel H7N9 has raised concerns about its pandemic potential, as well as that of related influenza viruses.",

            "text": "As there is no vaccine currently available for the prevention of avian influenza H7N9 infection in humans [17] , there remains an urgent need to develop a protective vaccine against H7N9 infection. New synthetic DNA vaccines have emerged as an attractive approach against various infectious diseases and cancers. Conceptually, DNA vaccines have many useful attributes over traditional vaccination strategies, such as live-attenuated vaccines, protein/peptide-based vaccines [18] [19] [20] . While DNA vaccines have been shown to be capable of eliciting balanced CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses as well as humoral immune responses in small-animal models [21] , their progress in the clinic historically has been hampered by difficulties in generating sufficiently potent T cell and humoral responses in humans [22, 23] . Until recently, the DNA platform has been used primarily in primeboost strategies along with viral vectors and proteins, thus creating an inordinately long testing and development window for addressing emerging pandemics rapidly. In order to address the technical hurdles associated with weak vaccine-induced immunity, we have recently applied many synthetic DNA design strategies, including codon/RNA optimization, the addition of highly efficient immunoglobulin leader sequences [24] [25] [26] , use of 'centralized' immunogens to broaden immunity and remove dependence on any individual viral sequence [27, 28] , new formulations [29] combined with highly efficient DNA delivery methods such as in vivo electroporation (EP) [30, 31] , to improve the induction of immune responses induced by DNA vaccines in small animals, macaques [31, 32] , and most recently and importantly, in humans [33, 34] . Here we present the first adaptation of this newly developed synthetic platform deployed to approach the feasibility of developing a protective vaccine against a rapidly emerging pathogen in real time.",

In addition, the vaccine was able to elicit protective levels of HAI titers to the H7N9 strain A/Anhui/1/2013. Challenge of mice with a lethal dose of A/Anhui/1/2013 virus confirmed 100% protection from influenza-driven mortality.

Herein, we studied the longevity and quality of CD4 and CD8 effector T cell memory induced by the H7HA DNA vaccine. Four weeks after the last vaccination, mice were sacrificed and splenocytes were stimulated in vitro with H7HA pooled peptides and the production of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2 by CD4 + CD44 + and CD8 + CD44 + T cells was analyzed. The H7HA DNA vaccine elicited significant HA-specific CD4 + T cells producing all three cytokines (Fig. 4A) , and a significant number of these cells were double positive (67%) and triple-positive (7%) (Figs. 4B-C). The triple positive and TNF\u03b1 + IL2 + double positive T cell phenotypes normally represent effector memory and central memory T cells (2) , indicating the induction of a memory like CD4 T cell immune response by our HA vaccine. In terms of CD8 T cells, we found that vaccination with pH7HA elicited substantially higher frequencies of HA-specific IFN\u03b3 + CD8 T cells, with up to 3.7% of total splenic CD44 + CD8 + T cells (Fig. 5A) producing either IFN-\u03b3 + alone (0.76%), dual IFN\u03b3 + /TNF\u03b1 + (2.7%) or triple IFN\u03b3 + /IL-2 + /TNF\u03b1 + (0.28%) (Figs. 5A-C). To further characterize the vaccine-induced T cells, we next analyzed the cytotoxic potential of the induced CD8 + T cells undergoing degranulation. Therefore, cultures were stained with an antibody to CD107a, which is a marker for degranulation, and we observed that CD8 T cells from the vaccinated mice showed a significant increase of antigen-specific (IFN\u03b3 + CD107a + : 3.8%) degranulation compared to na\u00efve mice. These results are indicative of the vaccine's potent ability to induce cytolytic T cell responses with the potential ability to clear H7N9 influenza infected cells. In addition, the vaccine also induced a high frequency of TNF-\u03b1 producing HA-specific CD4 (0.4%) and CD8 T cells (3.2%), with a modest but significant increase in IL-2 responses (0.2% and 0.3%, respectively) compared to the na\u00efve group ( Fig. 4A and 5A) . Interestingly, the proportional order of effector CD4 and CD8 T cell subpopulations in response to H7 HA stimulation was similar, with IFN\u03b3 + / TNF\u03b1 + being greater than IFN\u03b3 + /IL2 + /TNF\u03b1 + . The high frequencies of effector cells secreting IFN\u03b3 (CD8: 3.7%; CD4: 0.3%), IFN\u03b3 + /TNF\u03b1 + (CD8: 3.1%; CD4: 0.24%), and IFN\u03b3 + /IL2 + /TNF\u03b1 + among the HA-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell populations are indicative of strong vaccine potency induced by pH7HA vaccination (Figs. 4 & 5) . Overall, the frequency hierarchy of effector CD4 and CD8 memory T cells expressing one (1+), any combination of two (2+), or all three cytokine (3+) by flow cytometry were CD4 + CD44 + : 1+ (26%), 2+ (67%), 3+ (7%) and CD8+CD44+: 1+ (50%), 2+ (35%), 3+ (15%). Taken together, we observed that strong effector and memory T cells, as well as protective antibody responses induced by this vaccination approach. The magnitude of the T cell responses are similar to those induced by viral infection rather than weak responses which are generated by traditional DNA immunization [39] .",

Our study details the rapid development of a synthetic H7N9 HA DNA vaccine efficiently delivered in vivo by EP capable of eliciting not only strong effector T cell memory responses, but also broadly reactive antibody responses. More importantly, we confirmed that immunization with the pH7HA DNA vaccine induced protective HAI titers in all immunized animals and resulted in 100% protection from mortality and morbidity due to influenza H7N9 infection.

Given the mortality rate of H7N9 and its potential to infect a large number of humans, it is important to develop strategies that can thwart a potential growing pandemic. An ideal influenza vaccine platform for rapid deployment should include: 1) technologies that can be rapidly and straightforwardly utilized to design an effective vaccine against multiple known and new strains, 2) a delivery mechanism that can quickly induce cellular and humoral immune responses against new antigens in humans, 3) an approach that is rapid from design to scale up and mass production, with a relevant clinical track record and 4) an approach that is very stable for distribution purposes. Here we show that the enhanced DNA approach can exhibit these properties using the H7N9 pandemic as a demonstration platform. From computer immunogen design to having the immunogen in hand for animal studies is as short as 2-3 days under a pandemic setting. Immunization data is available in three weeks of this receipt. Seed stock is generated in just 3-4 days without any amplification or selection required thus limiting potential mutations being induced in the process of immunogen development. Distribution for production can begin as early as 5 days post pathogen detection. Using this approach, millions of doses could be produced at scale within a few months of identification of the pathogen [29, 40] . In addition the stability of DNA and the lack of requirement of any viral amplification step ensure fidelity in the process. Furthermore the growing safety record of DNA in the clinic in adults, the elderly and children all are important in suggesting the potential of this improved potency platform [41] .",

Many studies have shown that CD8 + T cells are induced following infection with influenza virus and play a critical role in rapid clearance of influenza virus, thus limiting pathogenesis [44, 45] . CD4 + T cells are also induced following influenza virus infection and play a role in maintaining CD8 + T cell memory response and providing help for B cells for rapid antibody production [46, 47] . Previous studies have identified 113 CD4 T cell and 35 CD8 T cell epitopes within the HA antigen [48] and some of these epitopes have been shown to confer protection in humans [49, 50] . The current study showed pH7HA could induce both potent polyfunctional effector CD4 and CD8 T cell memory responses. The percentage of antigenspecific CD8 cells secreting IFN\u03b3 + CD107a + increased significantly, indicating potential ability of this vaccine to induce cytolytic T cell responses to clear influenza H7N9 infected cells. These data support the idea that the synthetic vaccine could induce both antigenspecific antibody and T cell responses, which would be important for protection during a pandemic.",

The potent synthetic DNA vaccine platform eliminates many of hurdles that limited the rapid development and deployment of a vaccine against an emerging pandemic. The lack of a requirement for any recombination or in vivo production, as with some recent competing technologies, both quickens the production time line as well as eliminates a major potential source of errors in seed development. New production methods for DNA are further shortening this production timeline with a platform exhibiting a growing safety record in the clinic. Further study of this new platform for development of vaccines to combat pandemic infections, including influenza is warranted. Cytokine frequencies and phenotypic profiles of specific CD4 T cells after pH7HA immunization. Cytokine recall responses to H7 HA were measured 4 weeks after last immunization by ICS and flow cytometry. CD4 T cells were identified by CD3 expression and further gated as CD44+. (A) The percentage of total CD44+CD4 T cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 in response to H7 HA stimulation. (B) Average percentage of HA-specific CD44+CD4 double-positive-producing cells. (C) Multiparameter flow cytometry was used to determine the percentages of multifunctional CD4 T cell cytokine profile of H7HA. The bar chart shows the percentage of specific CD44+CD4 T cells displayed as triple, double, or single positive CD4 T cells. Pie charts show the relative proportion of each cytokine subpopulation to H7 HA stimulation. Background staining from cells stimulated with medium alone has been subtracted.
