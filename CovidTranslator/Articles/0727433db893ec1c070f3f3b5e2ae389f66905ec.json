On average cross-links are formed every 83 base pairs.

This high frequency of interaction makes replication but also transcription of genes impossible and inhibits DNA repair mechanisms.",

The introduction of an amine side chain renders amotosalen highly water soluble and less lipophilic than 8-MOP [8] . It can thus quickly pass cellular membranes, bacterial walls or viral envelopes and readily interact with nucleic acids without interacting with proteins or cellular lipids. The chemical structure of amotosalen is not changed upon cell entry and it is therefore also exceptionally well suited for the inactivation of intracellular pathogens, different from other photoactive compounds currently in use. It readily intercalates into double-helical structures of DNA or RNA where covalent bonds between its reactive groups and pyrimidine bases are formed upon UVA illumination. Even intrastrand reactions are possible. Thus single-stranded nucleic acids also serve as targets. The chemical interaction is very well described, highly specific between amotosalen and any of the commonly used platforms are well suited for the process as well. Double-dose apheresis collections or pooled buffy coats can be treated with a single process and split into two platelet units for transfusion.",

Therefore, a broad range of pharmacokinetic and toxicological analyses was performed. A large series of studies has been performed for amotosalen alone as well as for platelet or plasma components treated with the INTERCEPT Blood System with and without the use of the CAD. These included animal studies on acute and chronic toxicology but also studies to assess long-term toxicology like genotoxicity, reproductive toxicology, neonatal and juvenile animal development and carcinogenicity. Importantly, the studies on reproductive toxicity have great impact on the assessment of long-term safety of the product. They were of highest importance for the decision to use INTERCEPT-treated components for the support of pregnant women and women with child-bearing potential. Interestingly, the studies on genotoxicity revealed that the safety profile of amotosalen is much higher than that of the earlier mentioned 8-MOP, which is routinely used for PUVA therapy [29] .

Immune responses could be generated as a result of interactions between the eration of active oxygen species. As mentioned earlier the INTERCEPT technology per se offers a series of safety measures. The most important being the highly specific and controlled mechanism of action during the ex vivo treatment process, i.e. the nature of the active compound and the use of long-wavelength UVA light (320-400 nm). Furthermore, the chemistry of the amotosalen-nucleic acid interaction is very well understood and only occurs upon illumination with UVA light. As soon as the light source is turned off the reaction is stopped. As additional safety measure, the use of the CAD has been shown to reduce the amount of residual amotosalen from 150 \u03bcmol/l to approximately 0.5 \u03bcmol/l ( fig. 3 ). This is a very selective process as other molecules like proteins do not adsorb to the CAD matrix. This removal of amotosalen and its free photoproducts adds additional control to the process. Animal studies and also phase I and phase II clinical trials performed with healthy volunteers have shown that even without the CAD no toxicity was observed.",

Such treatment is not required for INTERCEPT platelets but causes unneeded damage to the platelets [42] and thus can be causative to the lower CI and CCI values.

This conclusion illustrates the challenges in the conduct of platelet transfusion clinical trials. For example, the imbalance in patient randomization and the high rate of off-protocol transfusions in HOVON 82 makes a definitive conclusion questionable. In addition, the recent platelet dose study (PLADO) in 1,200 patients, powered for bleeding assessment with 400 patients in each study arm, clearly showed that low doses of platelet transfusions are not associated with more bleeding [43] . Taken together, powered assessment of hemostasis requires studies significantly larger in size than the HOVON 82 study, with defined per protocol methods and conducted by observers blinded to treatment to insure adequate classification of bleeding. Differences in the methods to assess bleeding, lack of blinding, high degree of off-protocol transfusions and inadequate study size of the HOVON 82 study likely contributed to the discrepant reporting of bleeding as compared to the PLADO and SPRINT studies or the experience from the hemovigilance program and the routine use of INTERCEPT platelets.",

The pathogen-inactivated platelet concentrates were retained for up to 5 days, and growth of bacteria upon cultivation was analyzed. Even after this holding period no bacterial growth could be detected in the INTERCEPT-treated products [11] . Bacterial spores, like those from Bacillus cereus, are quite resistant to pathogen inactivation. The vegetative form of B. cereus instead was susceptible to INTERCEPT treatment. It is important to mention that bacteria like B. cereus normally exist in their vegetative form while in blood. They only form spores as a mechanism to survive when the conditions are not favorable. In this regard spores might not be a real important threat for transfusion of blood components. A recent study compared the capacity of bacterial detection methods with the INTERCEPT technology for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. The authors concluded that the bacterial detection method could lead to contaminated products being released for transfusion based on testnegative results while inactivation could reduce the risk [46] .",

While gamma-irradiation causes infrequent strand breaks in the leukocyte DNA and expression of IL-8 and IL-1\u03b2 could be detected, these substances could not be detected after INTERCEPT treatment [57] . Similar findings were described by Cognasse et al. [58, 59] . They demonstrated that INTERCEPT treatment of platelets did not increase the release of platelet derived growth factor-AB, tumor necrosis factor and, most interestingly, soluble CD40 ligand which has been described as implicated in transfusionassociated lung injury [58, 59] .",

Covalent crosslinks to the nucleic acid base pairs form upon exposure to UVA light (reactive groups highlighted in yellow), blocking DNA and RNA replication. 22 Transfus Med Hemother 2011;38:19-31",

The ordinate is optical density at 300 nm (as measured by the HPLC detector) and the abscissa is time in minutes. Equal volumes (20 \u03bcl) were injected onto the HPLC column for each of the traces. The amotosalen photoproducts are labeled A-G with residual amotosalen indicated by peak F. The peaks in labeled 'PP' are plasma peaks that are present on HPLC chromatograms of controls without amotosalen. TMP (4.5',8-trimethylpsoralen) serves as an internal standard for the HPLC assay.",
