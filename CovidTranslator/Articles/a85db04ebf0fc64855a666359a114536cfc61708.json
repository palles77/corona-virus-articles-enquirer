FH is home to 1.4 million people or 33% of the population of British Columbia 1 and has 12 hospitals that provide around-theclock emergency services. FH spreads geographically from Burnaby to Hope, and 28% of the population resides in a rural setting. 1 Since 2002, many of the services that each hospital offered have been reconfigured, resulting in the 12 hospital sites becoming co-dependent for specialty services.",
