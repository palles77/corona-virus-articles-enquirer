The examples were selected at random, with no particular bias toward analyzing a particular biomarker, or a class of biomarkers. Havlin (1987) has reviewed and analyzed the diffusion of reactants toward fractal surfaces. The details of the theory and the equations involved for the binding and the dissociation phases for analyteereceptor binding are available (Sadana, 2001) . The details are not repeated here, except that the equations are given to permit an easier reading. These equations have been applied to other biosensor systems (Sadana, 2001; Ramakrishnan and Sadana, 2001; Sadana, 2005) . For most applications, a single-or a dual-fractal analysis is often adequate to describe the binding and the dissociation kinetics. Peculiarities in the values of the binding and the dissociation rate coefficients, as well as in the values of the fractal dimensions with regard to the dilute analyte systems being analyzed will be carefully noted, if applicable.",

Above time t c the surface may be considered homogeneous, since the self-similarity property disappears, and \"regular\" diffusion is now present. For a homogeneous surface where D f \u00bc 2, and when only diffusional limitations are present, p \u00bc \u00bd as it should be. Another way of looking at the p \u00bc \u00bd case (where D f,bind \u00bc 2) is that the analyte in solution views the fractal object, in our case, the receptor-coated biosensor surface, from a \"large distance.\" In essence, in the association process, the diffusion of the analyte from the solution to the receptor surface creates a depletion layer of width (\u00d0t) \u00bd where \u00d0 is the diffusion constant. This gives rise to the fractal power law (Analyte.Receptor) w t \u00f03\u00c0D f;bind \u00de=2 . For the present analysis, t c is arbitrarily chosen and we assume that the value of the t c is not reached. One may consider the approach as an intermediate \"heuristic\" approach that may be used in the future to develop an autonomous (and not time-dependent) model for diffusion-controlled kinetics.",

This is when the binding curve exhibits convolutions and complexities in its shape due perhaps to the very dilute nature of the analyte (in some of the cases to be presented) or for some other reasons. Also, in some cases, a dual-fractal analysis may be required to describe the dissociation kinetics. Tuleuova et al. (2010) have developed an aptamer beacon for the detection of IFN-gamma, which is an important inflammatory cytokine. Boehm et al. (1997) indicate that it is secreted by immune cells in response to various pathogens. Tuleuova et al. (2010) indicate that the levels of this protein provide important information with regard to infectious diseases and the ability of the body to regulate an immune response. Panteleo and Koup (2004) indicate that there is vigorous production of IFN-gamma in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Tuleuova et al. (2010) indicate that previous antibodybased detection techniques for IFN-gamma were very time consuming. Jayasena (1999) indicates that aptamer-based affinity strategies are coming into prominence. Ellington and Szostak (1990) indicate that aptamers are single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotides that have been selected to bind to target analytes with high specificity and affinity. Aptamers have an advantage over antibodies since they are more robust; thus, aptamer-based biosensors can be regenerated and used over and over again. Furthermore, Balamurugan et al. (2008) , Kirby et al. (2004 ), Nutiu (2005 , and Luzi et al. (2003) indicate that aptamers are amenable to modification due to their simplicity and robustness. Tuleuova et al. (2010) indicate that FRET may be used to convert aptamers into real-time biosensors (Urata et al., 2007; Babendure et al., 2003) . Romangani et al. (1986) and Karlsson et al. (2003) indicate that IFNgamma is an important immune response marker. Thus, Tuleuova et al. (2010) have designed a novel immune response marker to detect IFN-gamma. The DNA aptamer was biotinylated and immobilized on an SPR sensing surface by avidinebiotin interactions. The SPR biosensor was used to analyze the influence of biotinylation, fluorophore attachment, and spacer incorporation on the ability of the aptamer to bind to IFN-gamma.",

            "text": "IFN-gamma is a type II cytokine, and is critical for innate and adaptive immunity against viral and intracellular bacterial infections and for tumor control. Incorrect IFN-gamma expression is associated with a number of autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. It plays an important role in immunostimulatory and immunoregulatory effects. The IFN-gamma monomer consists of six alpha-helices and an extended unfolded chain in the C-terminal region (Ealick et al., 1991; Thiel et al., 2000) . Tuleuova et al. (2010) analyzed the influence of aptamer modification on the binding and dissociation of IFN-gamma in solution. Figure 11 .1(a) shows the binding and dissociation of 100 nM IFN-gamma in solution to the modified aptamer 3 0 B (5 0 -GGG GTT GGT TGT GTT GGG TGT TGT GT-Biotin-3 0 ; sequence with modification) beacon. A single-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the binding and the dissociation kinetics. The values of (1) the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension for dissociation, D f , for binding and (2) the dissociation rate coefficient, k d , and the fractal dimension for dissociation, D fd for a single-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.1(a) and (b). Tuleuova et al. (2010) indicate that the highest level of the cytokine (IFN-gamma) binding was observed for the modified aptamer 3 0 B. Tuleuova et al. (2010) also included a polyethylene glycol spacer between the aptamer and the biotin so that the nucleotides could be more accessible to the target analyte. modified aptamer beacon. In this case, in addition to the biotin (B) a spacer was included (BS). Once again, a single-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the binding and the dissociation kinetics. The values of (1) the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , and (2) the dissociation rate coefficient, k d , and the fractal dimension for dissociation, D fd , for a single-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.1(a) and (b). It is of interest to note that as one goes from the modified aptamer beacon 3 0 B to the modified aptamer beacon 3 0 BS the binding rate coefficient, k, decreases by 4% from a value of k \u00bc 75.79 to k \u00bc 72.231, and the fractal dimension, D f , increases by a factor of 1.079 from a value of D f \u00bc 2.1364 to D f \u00bc 2.3058. In this case, changes in the fractal dimension (degree of heterogeneity on the biosensor surface) and in the binding rate coefficient are in opposite directions (Tables 11.1 (a) and (b)). Figure 11 .1(c) shows the binding of 100 nM IFN-gamma in solution to the 5 0 BS(5 0 -Biotin-C12-GGG GTT GGT TGT GTT GGG TGT TGT Gt-3 0 ) modified aptamer beacon. Once again, a single-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the binding and the dissociation kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , and (b) the dissociation rate coefficient, k d , and the fractal dimension for dissociation, D fd , are given in Tables 11.1(a) and (b). Note that in this case there is an increase in the fractal dimension, D f (the highest when compared with the B 0 and B'S aptamer modifications), and a decrease in the binding rate coefficient, k (the lowest when compared with B 0 and B'S aptamer modifications). In this case, there is a substantial decrease in the binding rate coefficient, k. The decrease is higher than a factor of four. Figure 11 .2(a) and Tables 11.1(a) and (b) show the increase in the binding rate coefficient, k, for a single-fractal analysis with an increase in the fractal dimension, D f . For the data shown in Figure 11 .2(a), the binding rate coefficient, k, is given by k The fit is reasonable. Only three data points are available. The availability of more data points would lead to a more reliable fit. The binding rate coefficient, k, exhibits close to a third (equal to 3.01) order of dependence on the fractal dimension, D f , that exists on the biosensor surface. This indicates that the binding rate coefficient, k, is sensitive to the fractal dimension, D f , or the degree of heterogeneity that exists on the biosensor surface (Tables 11.1(a) and (b)). Figure 11 .2(b) and Table 11 .1(a) and (b) show the increase in the affinity, K (\u00bck/k d ), for a single-fractal analysis with an increase in the fractal dimension ratio, D f /D fd . For the data shown in Figure 11 .2(b), the affinity, K, is given by",

The affinity, K (k/k d ), is very sensitive to the fractal dimension ratio (D f /D fd ) as it exhibits close to a fifth (equal to 5.064) order of dependence on the fractal dimension ratio (D f /D fd ). This is a very convenient way of manipulating the affinity, K, by changing the heterogeneity of the biosensor surface. Some ingenuity may be required here, since a change in the degree of heterogeneity on the biosensor surface would change both the binding as well as the dissociation rate coefficients. Figure 11 .3(a) shows the binding of the IFN-gamma to the biotin \u00fe aptamer B variant (Tuleuova et al., 2010) . Once again, a dual-fractal analysis is required to describe the binding kinetics. A single-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the dissociation kinetics. The values of (1) the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , for a single-fractal analysis, (2) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 and k 2 , and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 , for a dual-fractal analysis, and (3) the dissociation rate coefficient, k d , and the fractal dimension for dissociation, D fd , for a single-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.1(a) and (b).

Huang et al. (2009) have developed a localized LSPCF fiber-optic biosensor for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus nucleocapsid protein in human serum. These authors indicate that SARS is a highly infectious disease. Drosten et al. (2004) indicate that SARS results in death in a large portion of patients. The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causes SARS, and is detectable in the respiratory secretions of patients after infection (Foucher et al., 2003) . Wang et al. (2005) emphasize that SARS is highly contagious and exhibits the potential of becoming a large-scale future epidemic if effective therapeutic drugs are not discovered. Huang et al. (2004) and Che et al. (2005) emphasize the need for a rapid, sensitive, specific, and an accurate diagnostic method so that specific patients may be correctly assessed. Huang et al. (2009) indicate that there are methods available to detect SARS. However, present methods such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction are not sensitive enough, and also require a specific laboratory with expertise in molecular diagnostics to confirm SARS in the acute phase (Fujimoto et al., 2008; Drosten et al., 2004) . Huang et al. (2009) indicate that gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been introduced into biosensing (Manso et al., 2008; Cui et al., 2008) . These GNPs possess special properties such as localized surface plasmons. Huang et al. (2009) have developed a novel fiber-optic biosensor where the property of LSPCF has been combined with the sandwich immunoassay. Huang et al. (2009) have used their LSPCF fiber-optic biosensor to detect SARS-CoV protein in diluted serum to a limit of 1 pg/ml. This according to these authors exhibits the potential for the early detection of clinical SARS-CoV infection. Figure 11 .4 shows the binding of l000 pg/ml GST-N protein in solution to the LSPCF biosensor (Huang et al., 2009) . A single-fractal analysis is required to describe the binding kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k and the fractal dimension, D f for a single-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.2(a) and (b). Huang et al. (2009) prepared GST-N protein samples in 10-fold diluted human serum. This allowed them to test their LSPCF biosensor in clinical samples. They measured the temporal fluorescence intensity of the biomolecular interaction between the LSPCF probes and the GST-N protein. They did this for the 10e1000 pg/ml rages GST-N protein in solution. Figure 11 .5(a) shows the binding of 1000 pg/ml GST-N protein in 10-fold diluted human serum in solution. A dual-fractal analysis is required to adequately describe the binding kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k and the fractal dimension, D f for a single fractal analysis, and (b) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 and k 2 , and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 for a dual-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.2 (a) and (b). For a dualfractal analysis, an increase in the fractal dimension by a factor of 2.00 from a value of D f1 equal to 1.4938 to D f2 equal to 3.0 leads to an increase in the binding rate coefficient by a factor of 22.45 from a value of k 1 equal to 0.007192 to k 2 equal to 0.1615. Once again, an increase in the fractal dimension or the degree of heterogeneity on the LSPCF biosensor surface leads to an increase in the binding rate coefficient. Figure 11 .5(b) shows the binding of 100 pg/ml GST-N protein in 10-fold diluted human serum in solution. Once again, a dual-fractal analysis is required to adequately describe the binding kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k and the fractal dimension, D f for a single fractal analysis, and (b) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 and k 2 , and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 for a dual-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.2(a) and (b). For a dual-fractal analysis, an increase in the fractal dimension by a factor of 2.86 from a value of D f1 equal to 1.0502 to D f2 equal to 3.0 leads to an increase in the binding rate coefficient by a factor of 4.08 from a value of k 1 equal to 0.01768 to k 2 equal to 0.07217. Once again, an increase in the fractal dimension or the degree of heterogeneity on the LSPCF biosensor surface leads to an increase in the binding rate coefficient. Figure 11 .5(c) shows the binding of 10 pg/ml GST-N protein in 10-fold diluted human serum in solution. A dual-fractal analysis is required to adequately describe the binding kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k and the fractal dimension, D f for a single fractal analysis, and (b) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 and k 2 , and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 for a dual-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.2(a) and (b) once again, for a dual-fractal analysis, an increase in the fractal dimension by a factor of 14.4 from a value of D f1 equal to 0.2082 to D f2 equal to 3.0 leads to an increase in the binding rate coefficient by a factor of 52.9 from a value of k 1 equal to 0.002714 to k 2 equal to 0.1436. Once again, an increase in the fractal dimension or the degree of heterogeneity on the LSPCF biosensor surface leads to an increase in the binding rate coefficient.",

Their results indicate that four mutants exhibited a higher reaction rate with the radical as compared with the wild type. These mutants were then used for the construction of the superoxide biosensors. Figure 11 .6 shows the binding of cyt c in solution to the superoxide biosensor (Wegerich et al., 2009) . A single-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the binding kinetics. The binding rate coefficient, k and the fractal dimension, D f , for a single-fractal analysis are 0.2109 AE 0.0302, and 1.234 AE 0.1806, respectively. These results are also shown in Tables 11.3(a) and (b). A single-fractal analysis is also adequate to describe the dissociation kinetics. The values of the dissociation rate coefficient, k d and the fractal dimension, D fd are 0.00116 AE 0.00015 and 0.3666 and 0.14702, respectively. In this case the affinity, K (\u00bck/k d ) is equal to 181.81. Williams et al. (2010) have recently analyzed low noise detection of biomolecular interactions with signal-locking surface plasmon resonance. Surface plasmon resonance is a popular technique to analyze biomolecular interactions at a surface, especially since it is label-free. These authors indicate that the SPR technique is subject to the influence of noise and drift disturbances since that limits the minimum detectable mass change. The SPR technique uses the step response of the biomolecular interactions occurring on the biosensor surface. The technique proposed by Williams et al. (2010) measures the biomolecular interactions over a very narrow frequency range. This locks the measured response to a very specific narrow band signal. The authors used their technique to analyze the binding kinetics of carbonic anhydrase-II (CA-II) and immobilized 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonamide (ABS) to a SPR surface.",

            "text": "Carbonic anhydrases are a family of enzymes that catalyze the rapid conversion of carbon dioxide and water to bicarbonate and protons. These anhydrases are classified as metalloenzymes since the active site of most carbonic anhydrases contains a zinc ion. The primary function of this enzyme in animals is to maintain the acid-base balance in blood and other tissues, and to help transport carbon dioxide out of tissues. Carbon anhydrase II is a novel biomarker for gasterointestinal stomal tumors (Parkkila et al., 2010) . These authors indicate that various carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoenzymes have been identified as potential targets against different cancers. They further indicate that high CA-II expression is associated with a better disease specific survival rate than low or no expression. Figure 11 .7(a) shows the binding of 2.3mM CA-II anhydrase in solution to a 4-(2-amino ethyl)-benzene sulfonamide (ABS) ligand on a SPR biosensor surface (Williams et al., 2009) . A dual-fractal analysis is required to adequately describe the binding kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k and the fractal dimension, D f for a single fractal analysis, and (b) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 and k 2 , and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 for a dualfractal analysis are given in Tables 11.3(a) and (b). It is of interest to note that as the fractal dimension increase by a factor of 1.156 from a value of D f1 equal to 2.1364 to D f2 equal to 2.4698, the binding rate coefficient increases by a factor of 5.95 from a value of k 1 equal to 20.817 to k 2 equal to 120.16. Figure 11 .7(b) shows the binding of 5.3mM CA-II anhydrase in solution to a 4-(2-amino ethyl)-benzene sulfonamide (ABS) ligand on a SPR biosensor surface (Williams et al., 2009) . Once again, a dual-fractal analysis is required to adequately describe the binding kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k and the fractal dimension, D f for a single fractal analysis, and (b) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 and k 2 , and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 for a dual-fractal analysts are given in Tables 11.3(a) and (b). It is of interest to note that as the fractal dimension increase by a factor of 1.12 from a value of D f1 equal to 2.6146 to D f2 equal to 2.9294, the binding rate coefficient increases by a factor of 1.826 from a value of k 1 equal to 83.718 to k 2 equal to 152.87.

The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k and the fractal dimension, D f for a single fractal analysis, and (b) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 and k 2 , and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 for a dual-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.3(a) and (b) It is of interest to note that as the fractal dimension increase by a factor of 1.515 from a value of D f1 equal to 1.967 to D f2 equal to 2.9807, the binding rate coefficient increases by a factor of 5.98 from a value of k 1 equal to 39.916 to k 2 equal to 238.66.

These authors indicate that different studies on using chips to monitor cellular secretion have appeared in the literature (Cheng et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2006; El-All et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2007; Meyvantsso et al., 2008; Urbanskl et al., 2008) . Clark et al. (2009) indicate that physiological studies need to maintain cells or tissues in a controlled environment as one detects their physical, electrical and mechanical properties. These authors indicate micriofluidics facilitates such situations, since they permit creation of highly controlled cell-compatible environments along with measurement and cell maniplation methods. Clark et al. (2009) emphasize that the prevalence of obesity-related disorders underscores the need to adipocyte physiology. Adipocytes store and release energy. Adipocytes store energy as triacylglycerol by lipolysls. Ths supplies energy for tissues and organs. Getty et al. (2006) and Getty-Kaushik et al., (2005a,b) indicate that the measurement of glycerol is used to determine the function and physiological state of adipocytes. Clark et al. (2009) have developed a dual-chip microfluidic system for culturing adipocytes and then monitoring the glycerol using a continuous fluorescent enzyme assay after a perfusion step. The authors used their system to demonstrate transient increases in glycerol secretion during exposure of the cells to isoproterenol, a b-adrenergic agonist. These adrenergic agonists act on receptors.",

These beta receptors are located at many places in the body, but are found in high numbers in the heart and blood vessels. Here they increase blood pressure when stimulated. Thus, they are attractive targets for high blood pressure treatment. Clark et al. (2009) analyzed the glycerol secretion data from differentiated adipocytes and response to isoproterenol treatment. Figure 11 .9(a) shows the binding of glycerol secretion from differentiated (murine 3T3-L1) adipocytes by a continuous-flow enzyme assay on a microfluidic chip. A dual-fractal analysis is required to model the binding and the dissociation kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k and the fractal dimension, D f for a single-fractal analysis, (b) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 and k 2 and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 for a dual-fractal analysis, (c) the dissociation rate coefficient, k d and the fractal dimension, D fd for a single-fractal analysis, and (d) the dissociation rate coefficients, k d1 and k d2 and the fractal dimensions for the dissociation phase, D fd1 and D fd2 for a dual-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.4(a) and (b). Figure 11 .9(b) shows the binding of glycerol secretion from differentiated (murine 3T3-L1) adipocytesin the presence of iso proterenol by a continuous-flow enzyme assay on a microfluidic chip. A dual-fractal analysis is required to model the binding and the dissociation kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k and the fractal dimension, D f for a single-fractal analysis, (b) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 and k 2 and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 for a dual-fractal analysis, and (c) the dissociation rate coefficient, k d and the fractal dimension, D fd for a single-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.4(a) and (b). Albrecht et al. (2010) have recently presented a new assay design for clinical diagnostics based on alternative recognition. These indicate that the assay format has an important impact in the practical handling as well in the sensitivity of the testing results. Jaras et al. (2007) indicate that for clinical diagnostics the sandwich assay format is frequently used due to (a) its lower limits of detection compared to other formats, (b) and reliable analysis of the different parameters. Albrecht et al. (2010) further indicate that a drawback of the sandwich assay format is the need for immobilization of the capture antibody on the surface. This often results in a significant loss in binding activity. Also, there is no guarantee that the binding sites on the antibodies immobilized on the surface are oriented in the 'correct' direction. This hinders the biosensor performance parameters such as sensitivity, loss in function, and stability of the sensor surface. In essence, these authors indicate that the recognition element on the sensor surface needs to exhibit a high affinity and specificity towards the antigen (analyte) in solution on being immobilized on the biosensor surface. Albrecht et al. (2010) have presented an immunoassay set-up that uses a small and stable peptide sequence as the immobilized recognition element (receptor) (Baltzer, 2007) . Albrecht et al. (2010) indicate that their recognition elements are small helix loop-helix motifs. These recognition elements contain natural binders of the target analyte. Furthermore, these motifs are easily accessible. Also, these authors indicate concerted modifications made for immobilization at the artificial helices do not affect binding properties. Albrecht et al. (2010) have presented a new sandwich-type assay for the detection of C-reactive protein (CRP). They used a tailored binder as the capture element on the sensor surface, and an antibody as a detection element. C-reactive protein is a protein found in blood. Its levels rise in response to inflammation. Thompson et al. (1999) indicate that its physiological role is to bind to phosphocholine expressed on the surface of dead or dying cells in order to activate the complement system via the C1Q complex.",

Tang et al. (2010) further indicate that hepatitis viruses are one of the leading causes of mortality (Bilora et al., 2009) . Thus, an early diagnosis for hepatitis B viruses is critical. Tang et al. (2010) further emphasize that the simultaneous determination of multiple virus antigens is helpful in clinical diagnosis since the patient usually suffers from multiple virus antigens (Cornberg et al., 2008; Gitlin, 1997) . Tang et al. (2010) emphasize that potentiometric assays are highthroughput systems, are label-free, exhibit low assay cost, and their simplicity permits miniaturization as well as signal quantification (Wu et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2007) .
