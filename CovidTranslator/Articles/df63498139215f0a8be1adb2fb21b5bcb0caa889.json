A variety of cell-culture derived vaccines are available for prophylaxis against rabies. However, their high cost restricts their usage in developing countries, where such cases are most often encountered. This is driving the quest for newer vaccine formulations; DNA vaccines being most promising amongst them. Here, we explored strategies of antigen trafficking to various cellular compartments aiming at improving both humoral and cellular immunity. These strategies include use of signal sequences namely Tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA), Ubiquitin (UQ) and Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein-1 (LAMP-1). TPA, LAMP-1 and their combination were aimed at enhancing the CD4 + T cell and antibody response. In contrast, the UQ tag was utilized for enhancing CD8 + response. The potency of modified DNA vaccines assessed by total antibody response, antibody isotypes, cytokine profile, neutralizing antibody titer and protection conferred against in vivo challenge; was enhanced in comparison to native unmodified vaccine, but the response elicited did not pertain to the type of target sequence and the directed arm of immunity. Interestingly, the DNA vaccines that had been designed to generate different type of immune responses yielded in effect similar response. In conclusion, our data indicate that the directing target sequence is not the exclusive deciding factor for type and extent of immune response elicited and emphasizes on the antigen dependence of immune enhancement strategies.",

Majority of rabies cases reported from developed countries involve wild animals like raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes. However, it is a major health concern in developing countries which account for more than 99% of all human deaths from rabies [2] . Exposure to rabid dogs is the cause of bulk (>99%) of human rabies deaths world-wide [3] . India has a particularly severe problem, with as many as 30,000 human deaths and 2 million people requiring post-exposure vaccination yearly. Stray and community dogs cause vast majority of human cases. Though potent and safe cell-culture derived inactivated vaccines are available, their efficacy may be compromised by disruption of cold chain storage, poor general health status of the subject, poor vaccination techniques.",

DNA vaccines being free from foreign proteins may not cause the various side reactions, which may be observed for conventional vaccines.

They have been shown to induce significant humoral and cell-mediated responses [23] . LAMP-1 is a type of transmembrane protein localized predominantly to lysosomes and late endosomes. Antigen trafficking of LAMP-1-fused antigens to the cellular site of MHC Class II processing and presentation pathway could enhance its presentation to MHC Class II restricted CD4 + T cells [24] and thus augment the humoral response. On the other hand, for directing the antigen to MHC Class I, signal sequence of Ubiquitin A-76 (UQ) was employed. UQ-conjugated antigens are trafficked through the proteasome, an organelle that generates short peptides for presentation via the MHC Class I pathway [25] . Such UQ-conjugated antigens are expected to enhance the cellular immune response. UQ-conjugated proteins have been shown to generally undergo rapid intracellular degradation and can elicit cytokine responses in the absence of specific antibody production [26] . Thereby, we explored the potential of targeted DNA vaccine encoding the glycoprotein antigen fused to TPA, LAMP-1 or UQ to elicit superior immune response in comparison to the unmodified (without target sequence) DNA vaccine.",

The sequences of clones bearing the address tags, pgp-Native, pTPA.gp.LAMP-1 (GenBank Accession Number EU715585), pTPA.gp (GenBank Accession Number EU715586), pUQ.gp (GenBank Accession Number EU715587), pgp.LAMP-1 (GenBank Accession Number EU715588) were confirmed by sequencing using ABI PRISM, Model 3730, Version 3.0 (Sequencing primers listed in Supplementary Table 1) and designated as represented in the Fig. 1 . The respective constructs were processed for the purification of plasmid DNA using the Endofree plasmid isolation maxi kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified plasmid DNA (1-2 mg/ml) was dissolved in autoclaved Milli Quartz (MQ) water and stored at \u221220 \u2022 C, until further use. The glycoprotein gene was similarly PCR amplified (see Supplementary Table 1 for primer sequences) using pTargeT.rabgp as template and cloned in pQE30 expression vector (T5 expression system). rGP was expressed as a fusion protein with 6\u00d7 histidine tag in E. coli SG (pREP-4) strain and was purified on a Ni 2+ -NTA column to more than 95% homogeneity under native conditions.

Transient transfection of BHK-21 cells with all the plasmid DNA constructs revealed expression of rabies glycoprotein by flow cytometric analysis. Majority of the cells were found to express glycoprotein as seen by the fluorescence monitored by cell sorter. Thus, DNA vaccine constructs were capable of efficiently expressing the glycoprotein. Distribution of chimeras was analyzed by subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting. Total cell lysate of transfected BHK-21 cells of all the constructs expressed glycoprotein at approximately 67 kDa. The observed high molecular weight of RV-G expressed in BHK-21 cells could be due to the influence of host factors on glycosylation [45] . Morimoto et al. showed both BHK and Murine Neuroblastoma (MNA) cell lines, transformed with the same retroviral expression vector encoding RV-G cDNA, show different patterns of glycosylation of the expressed RV-G [45] . rRV-G expressed by BHK cells was highly glycosylated and sialylated in comparison to MNA expressed rRV-G, indicating that the glycosylation and sialylation of RV G is dependent on the cellular conditions in which RV-G is produced. Analysis of subcellular fractions indicated that glycoprotein along with the targeting sequences was suitably recognized by mammalian cells and directed towards the respective pathway.

This was assessed by cytokine profiling of splenocytes immunized with signal sequence tagged glycoprotein based vaccine or only vector; upon in vitro stimulation with inactivated PV-11 virus. We found that all the cytokines analyzed could be detected from the splenocytes of DNA vaccine immunized mice, with a pronounced enhancement in the level of IL-2 and IL-12 in the pgp.LAMP-1 immunized group. For other cytokines, namely IL-4 and IFN-\u2425, similar levels of cytokines were observed for all the four groups, with the level being several folds in comparison to the splenocytes from control group. Antigen binding to the T cell receptor (TCR) stimulates the secretion of IL-2, and the expression of IL-2 receptors IL-2R. The IL-2/IL-2R interaction then stimulates the growth, differentiation and survival of antigen-selected cytotoxic T cells via the activation of the expression of specific genes. IL-2 facilitates production of immunoglobulins made by B cells and induces the differentiation and proliferation of natural killer cells. IL-12, produced mainly by macrophages and dendritic cells, is quickly induced by viral infections or by vaccination stimuli. IL-12 strengthens the non-specific immune responses by activating NK cells to produce IFN-\u2425 and in synergy with IFN-\u2425, drives the differentiation of CD4 + T cells into Th1 cells, more adapted to the control of viral infections.",

High titers of RVNA and protection conferred in DNA vaccines might be due to the possibility that modified immunogens led to the expression of RV-G with appropriate folding and better accessibility of epitopes to immune system, critical for generating RVNA titers. In spite of similar magnitude of immune response generated, protective efficacies against viral challenge varied. The unmodified and secreted forms of vaccines were found to be inferior in inducing protection against viral challenge. Xiang et al. also reported that secreted form of vaccine did not confer significant protective immunity [46] . Protection against rabies virus is mainly mediated by neutralizing antibodies [47] ; subtle differences in the conformation of the secreted protein, not readily detectable by conventional biochemical methods, might select a different repertoire of neutralizing antibodies with lower avidity to the full length G protein present on the surface of viral particles, thus being less able to prevent the spread of virus [48] .",

A probable explanation for this could be that the tagged antigens evoke similar levels of immunity and act to enhance survival via the same primary protective mechanism. We observed that ubiquitination of antigen for MHC Class I targeting also enhanced the IgG1 antibody and CD4 + mediated cytokine response. Thus, we infer that the peptides generated by proteasomal degradation could also be presented by MHC-II. While, there is no specific information of how protein processing in transfected cells occurs in vivo, different mechanisms have been postulated. They include direct priming by somatic cells, direct priming by antigen-presenting cells, or cross priming of antigen-presenting cells. Activation by cross priming appears to be the most probable immune mechanism which occurs following intramuscular vaccination that could be shared by the TPA, LAMP-1 and UQ vaccines [24, [49] [50] [51] [52] . Cross priming may occur via exit of exogenous antigens from the endocytic compartments and its processing in the cytosol, recycling of MHC-I molecules through endosomal/lysosomal pathway and transfer of processed peptides to the endosomal compartments. It is well known that CD4 + T-cell stimulation can result from endocytosis of exogenous peptides or proteins followed by antigenic processing via MHC Class II pathways [53] . LAMP-1 targeting of antigen has been reported to increase the number of immunogenic peptide epitopes that activate CD4 + T cells, thus inducing a broadened immune response in comparison to untargeted antigen [54] . Recent studies have also demonstrated that exogenous proteins or peptides, possibly complexed to heat shock proteins, can be taken up by antigen processing cells, processed through the MHC Class I pathway, and ultimately stimulate na\u00efve CD8 cells [55, 56] . Thus, via cross-priming mechanisms, secreted fusion proteins expressed from TPA plasmids, membrane bound fused proteins expressed from LAMP-1 or peptides released from cells transfected with the UQ constructs could induce both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell populations.",

Successful targeting was demonstrated for several pathogens including Human papillomavirus [57] , Influenza A [38] ; Mycobacterium [39] ; but not for all the constructs tested against malaria [58] . Thus, a tagged DNA vaccine may represent an 'ideal' immunogen for generating protective immune response, nevertheless; the antigen dependence of immune strategies has to be considered for successful vaccination against any pathogen. Further, optimization of immunization doses, routes, schedule, adjuvant supplementation and a greater understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for producing protective immunity in response to DNA vaccination should facilitate the creation of further improved Rabies DNA vaccination strategies.",
