This study aimed to assess the confidence and its predictors in HMPX case management among general practitioners (GPs), the frontline doctors in Indonesia, and to explore their perspectives on HMPX. Between May and July 2019, GPs in Indonesia completed an online-based survey. The questionnaire collected information on GPs' confidence, perspective, sociodemographic, workplace and professional characteristics, exposure to HMPX information and knowledge on HMPX. A logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the explanatory variables influencing the confidence and the perspective. We included 395 GPs in our analysis (77.4% out of 510 responses received) of which 10.1% and 34.9% were classified having good confidence using an 80% and 70% cut-off for confidence score, respectively. In the adjusted analysis, receiving information about HMPX during medical training was the only variable significantly associated with good confidence (adjusted odds ratio 2.74, 95% confidence interval 1.57 to 4.78 and p<0.001). Approximately 73.6% and 77.9% of GPs agreed that HMPX is an important infectious disease and it has potential to detrimentally impact the Indonesian economy, respectively. In addition, 88.8% of GPs suggested that the disease should be incorporated into the National Medical Curriculum of Indonesia. In conclusion, in case of HMPX outbreak, majority of the GPs in Indonesia seem to be less confident in",

Recent HMPX outbreaks were reported in Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Liberia, Nigeria and Cameroon (Beer and Rao, 2019; Ogoina et al., 2019; Yinka-Ogunleye et al., 2019) . In the 2017-2018 outbreak in Nigeria, after not being reported for over 20 years, the case fatality rate was 6% (Yinka-Ogunleye et al., 2019) . Imported HMPX cases also have been reported in the United States (Reed et al., 2004; Sejvar et al., 2004) , the UK (Vaughan et al., 2018) , and Israel (Erez et al., 2019) . In Asia, the first confirmed HMPX case was reported in Singapore in May 2019; the patient was a Nigerian man who attended a workshop in Singapore (Ng et al., 2019) . The emergence of HMPX in different locations throughout the world indicates that this is a problem of global importance.",

With very rare cases and relatively new disease in the region (Ng et al., 2019) and lack of knowledge of HMPX , frontline HCWs might have no confidence managing the cases if a HMPX outbreak occurred. This problem has been shown for other emerging infectious diseases; in Taiwan, for example, more than 70% of nurses expressed a lack of confidence being involved in managing severe acute respiratory syndrome (Hsu et al., 2006) .
