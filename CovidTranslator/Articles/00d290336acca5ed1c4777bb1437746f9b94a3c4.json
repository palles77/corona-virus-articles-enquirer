This classically sets them apart from other clinical infectious conditions that are caused by an easily identifiable organism or a small number of related organisms (e.g. typhoid fever). Some such syndromes may have a bacterial, viral, or other etiology. Diseases of infectious etiology, including common infectious diseases such as dengue fever, are increasingly presenting with protean manifestations or with atypical manifestations. Presently, a paradigm shift is occurring in the clinician's approach to the patient as having an 'acute febrile illness' (the syndromic approach), in which the clinician recognizes that there are multiple different infectious agents that could potentially cause the disease. Successful treatment of such patients requires identification of the specific causative agent and therefore relies on laboratory diagnostic packages provided for specific syndromes.",

This information on the etiology has enhanced understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of these syndromes, but the methods that have been employed have been cumbersome and slow. Presently, the approach is to develop a single technologic 'platform'-based diagnosis for distinct infectious syndromes, with a rapid turn-around time (<8 hours). Developments in molecular detection have facilitated such an approach using PCR and its modifications, DNA microarrays, and nanotechnology. The use of multiplex PCR (mPCR) and DNA microarrays has already begun to move from the research arena into clinical service laboratories. However, nanotechnology is still an emerging field with the exciting potential for diagnosis of infectious diseases. Nanomaterials are versatile and can be engineered into biofunctionalized particles. The field of pathogen detection has begun to exploit the unique optical and magnetic properties of nanoscale materials, such as fluorescent nanoparticles, metallic nanostructures, and super-paramagnetic nanoparticles, for bioimaging and detection of infectious micro-organisms. [1] This article lists important and widely recognized entities of infectious syndromes and reviews the recent literature regarding molecular and nanotechnology-based methods used in their diagnosis. A literature search on this topic reveals a paucity of specific information that would give insights into syndromes of infectious origin. There are few research laboratories and biotechnology companies trying to develop useful devices for infectious syndromes. The available literature has certain limitations from a geographic point of view because the researchers have developed platforms for comprehensive diagnosis of important syndromes in their regions. The review shows the lacunae that researchers in tropical countries must address when developing appropriate platforms that are relevant to their regions for use in hospitals and public health laboratories.",

Certain post-amplification methods -which include Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing of target genes, reverse hybridization, and Luminex analysis -are coming into use in Western countries.

It is difficult to achieve a differential etiologic diagnosis of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV). A rapid method has been described, using padlock probes and microarrays to detect and simultaneously differentiate the three viruses in a single reaction (the padlock probe microarray assay). The assay had a lower limit of detection of 144 median tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) per assay for FMDV, 720 TCID50 per assay for VSV, and 29 TCID50 per assay for SVDV. Although this method was not evaluated on clinical samples, the authors concluded that it is comparable to real-time PCR. [3] Likewise, a high-throughput multiplexed assay has been developed for laboratory use to detect and differentiate FMDV from other similar disease-causing viruses. The assay simultaneously screens for five RNA and two DNA viruses by using multiplexed reverse-transcription PCR (mRT-PCR) amplification coupled with a microsphere hybridization array and flow-cytometric detection. The sensitivity of mRT-PCR for FMDV was 93.5% and the specificity was 91.9%, but this evaluation was performed only on a panel of clinically confirmed positive and negative cases. [4] An interesting study described the application of a long oligonucleotide microarray assay for identification of viruses that are known to cause vesicular or vesicular-like lesions in livestock animals. The results suggested that the microarray assay could be a valuable tool for diagnosis of vesicular and vesicular-like diseases. [5] The assay was used on epithelium samples from vesicular lesions, but the authors reported difficulty with template preparation. Furthermore, the assay had varied sensitivity for different viruses. Further validation of the probe sets and optimization of sample preparation procedures are needed.",

The lower limit of detection was less than 1 plaque-forming unit (PFU). The assay was specific to JEV; it did not falsely detect other flaviviruses such as dengue virus and West Nile virus (WNV).

The BIP anneals to the DNA strand produced in step 5. Starting from the 3 0 end of the BIP, synthesis of the complementary strand takes place. This process allows the DNA to revert from a loop structure to a linear structure. The B3 primer anneals to the outside of the BIP and then, through the activity of DNA polymerase and starting at the 3 0 end, the DNA synthesized from the BIP is displaced and released as a single strand before DNA synthesis from the B3 primer. (7) This process allows dsDNA synthesis. routes. Thus, assays detecting these viruses could be used in screening blood and blood products and for patients attending STI clinics. A method has been developed, based on real-time mRT-PCR performed within the microarray hydrogel pads. In this assay, double-stranded amplification products are simultaneously detected using nonspecific SYBR Green I dye by testing in separate pads bearing 5 0 -immobilized specific primers. It has been evaluated on reference strains and some stored plasma samples. The lower limit of detection ranged from 10 to 15 genome equivalents per 25 mL reaction assay for the three viruses that were tested. The sensitivity and specificity were established to be 100%. [13] Globally, human papillomavirus (HPV) is a very important STI agent. Multiple genotypes of this virus can cause genital warts, and certain types of HPV-16 and -18 are now known to be involved in the etiology of cervical cancers. Early diagnosis of infections of this virus is therefore important. A DNA microarray chip assay based on light-scattering of aggregated silica nanoparticle probes has been developed. [14] Here, target HPV DNA is sandwiched between the capture DNA immobilized on the chip and the probe DNA immobilized on the plain silica nanoparticle. The spots where the sandwich reaction occurs appear bright white and are readily distinguishable with the naked eye. Visual detection was most efficient using 286 nm silica nanoparticles and 200 pM of target DNA. The authors demonstrated the development of such a portable nanodevice for detection and genotyping of HPV. [14] The lower limit of detection was 100 pM with a simple microscope illumination system, and 200 pM to 1 nM with the naked eye. The advantages include the low cost of the light-scattering detector system and the ability to use the system without the device by nakedeye examination; also, plain silica particles are readily available.",

The visual DNA microarray was capable of simultaneous, sensitive, and specific detection of HIV-1 and Treponema pallidum. This assay uses a gold label silver stain (GLSS) coupled with asymmetric mPCR. With this method, 5 0 -end amino-modified oligonucleotides are immobilized on a glass surface and used as the capturing probes to bind the complementary biotinylated target DNA. Gold-conjugated streptavidins are used in the microarray for specific binding to biotin. The microarray spots develop (black) as a result of the precipitation of silver onto nanogold particles that are bound to streptavidin. PCR products of HIV-1 and T. pallidum were used as positive controls. The results were comparable to real-time PCR findings. The lower limit of detection of the assay was 10 6 copies mL of target DNA amplicons prepared by conventional PCR and mPCR, but 10 4 copies mL when prepared by asymmetric PCR and asymmetric mPCR. Subsequently, Tang et al. [17] developed a GLSS-dependent visual protein microarray technique for simultaneous, sensitive, and specific detection of Ureaplasma parvum and Chlamydia trachomatis. The authors used the N-terminus multiple-banded antigen of U. parvum and the major outer membrane protein of C. trachomatis. In this assay, the specific antigens are labeled with nanogold-staphylococcal protein A (SPA) and immobilized on a glass surface treated with 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane. The bound antigens are recognized by the complementary target antibodies applied to the prepared microarray surface. The assay utilizes a 'sandwich' format, wherein the nanogold-SPA probe is used as an indicator and GLSS is applied to amplify the detection signals and produce black images on array spots, which are visible with the naked eye. The lower limit of detection of the protein microarray assay was 2 ng mL. The sensitivity was comparable to that of the fluorescent detection method. The results were found to be consistent with ELISA and quantitative real-time PCR assay in clinical samples. The current literature documents several successful attempts at developing diagnostic tools to aid diagnosis of the STI syndrome. The assays require evaluation at various laboratories for field testing before wide use.",

This refers to a group of illnesses that are caused by several distinct families of viruses. In general, the term VHF is used to describe a severe multisystem syndrome (i.e. multiple organ systems in the body are affected). Characteristically, the overall vascular system is damaged, and the body's ability to regulate itself is impaired. These symptoms are often accompanied by hemorrhage (bleeding); however, the bleeding itself is rarely life threatening. [18] The agents of VHF are all enveloped RNA viruses. Their survival is dependent on an animal or insect host, called the natural reservoir. The viruses are geographically restricted to the areas where their host species live. Humans are not the natural reservoir for any of these viruses. Humans are infected when they come into contact with infected hosts. However, with some viruses, after accidental transmission from the host, humans can transmit the virus to one another. Human cases or outbreaks of hemorrhagic fevers caused by these viruses occur sporadically and irregularly. The occurrence of outbreaks cannot be easily predicted. With a few noteworthy exceptions, there is no cure or established drug treatment for VHFs. Because other diseases have similar clinical symptoms, specific laboratory diagnostic tests are necessary to provide differential diagnosis, especially during outbreaks. Specific diagnosis would help public health officials to institute appropriate measures to control the outbreak.",

The 5-type hepatitis virus antibodies were immobilized on an electrochemical sensor array, using nanogold particles and protein A as individual matrices. The immunosensor array was used to capture their corresponding antigens from the sample solution with a one-step capture format. The analyte detection depends on the electrical potential change from the native state to the analyte-bound state by using a two-electrode system. All five types of hepatitis virus antigens were identified by the immunosensor assay within 5 minutes, with a detection limit of \u00a31.0 ng mL. Moreover, the assay did not show any crossreaction or nonspecific binding. This chip-based immunosensor array opens up new opportunities for high-throughput multi-analyte immunoassays for simple nanodevices that physicians could use at the point of care.",

[25] reported a quantum dot (QD)-DNA nanosensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) for detection of DNA and a single mismatch in the HBV genome by examination of a synthetic 30-mer oligonucleotide containing the mutations rtm204m and rtm204v in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene, indicating resistance to lamuvidine used in the treatment of HBV infection. The study used watersoluble cadmium selenide zinc sulfide QDs with 3-mercaptopropionic acid. Subsequently, oligonucleotides were attached to the QD surface to form functional QD-DNA conjugates. Sandwiched hybrids were formed with the addition of DNA targets and Cy5-modified signal DNAs into the QD-DNA conjugates. The resulting assembly allows the Cy5 fluorophore (the acceptor) and the QD (the donor) to be brought into proximity, resulting in fluorescence emission from the acceptor by means of FRET, following illumination of the donor. The authors used an oligonucleotide ligation assay to detect singlebase mutants in the HBV genome. They showed that if there was a single-base mismatch, this was recognized by the ligase, hence the detection probe was not ligated and no Cy5 emission was produced, because of the lack of FRET. The QD-DNA FRET-based nanosensor assay had a lower limit of detection of 4 nM. The advantages of this technique include the simplicity and efficiency of using a multi-label plate assay to detect singlebase mutants in target DNA, using multicolor dyes, rather than using a fluorimeter. Fluorometric methods are more complicated and time consuming for detecting and characterizing signals from such a QD-DNA FRET system. This method is simple and efficient and could be potentially used for highthroughput multiplex detection of target DNA and the mutants. Figure 5 shows the principle of QDs.",

Levels of this antigen are reported to be significantly higher in transmitting mothers than in non-transmitting mothers. [33] Early diagnosis of maternal infections that have a bearing on fetal health and development of the newborn is of great importance to obstetricians and perinatalogists. Several infections are recognized in this category, and there have been some important developments in successful diagnosis of the multiple etiologies. For example, recent work toward a common molecular method for diagnosis of the TORCH group of infections has led to development of a QD-based protein microarray to simultaneously detect TORCH-related antibodies in sera. The technique combines the principles of immunofiltration and QDlabeled probes for detection.

The panel included nine genera and 16 virus species. Consensus genus-specific primers were used to reverse transcribe the viral target genes so as to minimize the interference of other viruses. 70-mer oligonucleotides were used at the genus level and 50-mer oligonucleotides were used at the species level. The second-strand synthesis was carried out with random primers. The amplified products were labeled and processed for microarray analyses. We agree with the authors, who stated that this assay could potentially be used for clinical diagnosis. [36] A one-step, single tube, real-time RT-LAMP assay was developed and evaluated with standard strains and clinical specimens spiked with different concentrations of virus strains for detecting the envelope gene of WNV. [37] The specificity of the RT-LAMP assay was validated by the absence of any crossreaction with other, closely related members of the Flavivirus group. These results indicate that the RT-LAMP assay is extremely rapid, cost effective, and highly sensitive (detection limit = 0.1 PFU of virus), and has potential usefulness for rapid, comprehensive WNV surveillance along with virus isolation and or serology. [37] The same group has developed a dengue virus serotype-specific RT-LAMP assay in clinical isolates and serum samples from confirmed cases, which did not cross react with WNV or JEV. The RT-LAMP assay showed sensitivity of 0.1-1 PFU of virus (10-to 100-fold more sensitive than RT-PCR). In patient serum samples with reference to the results of virus isolation, the assay had sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 93%.

            "text": "A recent development has been the use of DNA-microarray platform technology (the Virochip) for detection of viruses causing pediatric respiratory tract infections. [41] The Virochip was compared with conventional direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) and PCR-based testing for detection of respiratory viruses on nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. The Virochip showed sensitivity of 85-90% and specificity of \u202199% for RSV, influenza A, and the rhinoviruses enteroviruses that were tested; it showed 19% greater detection than DFA. Interestingly, the Virochip was able to detect mixed infections as well, unlike DFA and PCR. [41] In an important study on acute LRTIs, a cost-effective mPCR assay for use on nasopharyngeal aspirates was reported for detection of RSV, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and human metapneumovirus. The mPCR assay detected respiratory viruses in 35.2% of 301 samples. This study in young children showed predominance of RSV; mixed viral infections were detected in 18.8% of the children. [42] Use of the more recently introduced RT-LAMP assay has been reported for highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus infection. [43] The authors reported 100-fold higher sensitivity of this assay compared with one-step RT-PCR. The assay was highly specific for the H5 subtype. The development of platforms for agents causing LRTIs is an exciting improvement in the field of molecular diagnosis of respiratory infections.",

            "text": "The term 'opportunistic infection' refers to a group of infections causing diseases such as encephalitis or lymphadenitis in primarily or secondarily immunocompromised patients (e.g. HIV-infected individuals or transplant recipients). Opportunistic culture (for bacteria), cell culture (for viruses), microscopy, and serology. Often, laboratory investigations have focused on established pathogens that are linked to the clinical conditions, in essentially a 'hit or miss' approach. This approach is now considered by experts to be highly inefficient. It is imperative that comprehensive epidemiologic data are obtained to allow development of assays that could be used in a given region of the world or globally. Current trends in the development of molecular and nanotechnology-based diagnostic tools are very encouraging. The molecular techniques that hold special promise in this area are PCR-based DNA microarrays, realtime mPCR, and nanotechnology-based devices for nanoscale reactions, wherein the analyte is detected by a biosensor.",

(1) The LAMP assay is entirely carried out at 65\u00b0C, when the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is in the state of dynamic equilibrium. In these conditions, one of the LAMP primers can anneal to the complimentary sequence of dsDNA (the target). Initiation of DNA synthesis is facilitated by DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity. The enzyme displaces and releases the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). There is no denaturation step involved. The forward primers F1, F2, and F3 and the backward primers B1, B2, and B3 anneal to the complementary sequence (F1C, F2C, and F3C; B1C, B2C, and B3C) on one strand, extending the complementary strand sequence. Usually, six primers bind to about eight sites in the entire target sequence. (2) The DNA polymerase acts on the complementary DNA (cDNA) strand of the template DNA, starting from the 3 0 end of the F2 region of the forward inner primer (FIP), and proceeding with strand synthesis. (3) The F3 primer anneals to the F3C region, releasing the FIP-linked complementary strand. (4) DNA synthesis proceeds from the F3 primer. (5) F1C (the FIP-linked complementary strand) is then released as a single strand because of displacement by the DNA strand synthesized from F3P, and the released single strand forms a stem-loop structure at the 5 0 end. The loop formation occurs because F1C is complimentary to the F1 regions.",

The multiplex PCR product of HCV (produced with biotinylated primers) is applied in the reaction vessel containing the matrix. After hybridization, the captured amplicons are detected by a biotin-streptavidin enzyme conjugate with a substrate color reaction.

            "text": "infections can be caused by viruses, bacteria, protozoa, or fungi; the number of agents is very large, and pathogen-specific diagnosis is available for the vast majority of these. There are assays available that are designed to identify the pathogen causing encephalitis in immunocompromised patients; for example, real-time PCR assays for DNA neurotropic viruses. [44] Use of a PCR-based, low-density DNA microarray has been reported for pathogens known to cause granulomatous lymphadenitis. [45] The assay was used on DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue. The mPCR amplicons were hybridized to glass slides containing probes from Mycobacterium spp., Yersinia spp., Bartonella henselea, and T. gondii. The study found that the technique was useful in making a specific diagnosis, though it would benefit from inclusion of a broader range of probe sequences for additional species-specific assays.The number of immunosuppressed patients is growing worldwide as a result of the widespread increase in transplantation programs in different parts of the globe, as well as the still-smoldering HIV pandemic; consequently, the frequency of opportunistic infections is also increasing. Presently, there are several platforms based on real-time mPCR or DNA microarrays for important viral infections, especially of the herpes group, as discussed in section 2.2. [6, 46] 3. Geographic Region-Specific Etiology of the Syndrome Data available from different areas of the globe indicate similarity in the etiology of certain infectious conditions, where the agents are latent in individuals and cause 'endogenous' infections, such as opportunistic infections, among immunosuppressed individuals. Many of these infections are not communicable, i.e. they are not transmissible to members of the community except in special settings. However, the vast majority of the infections are communicable (exogenous) and pose a public health threat because of their ability to cause outbreaks or epidemic infections. Such communicable diseases may spread globally (e.g. avian flu and pandemic influenza [swine flu]), whereas other infectious syndromes, such as VHFs and some acute febrile illnesses, occur in geographically restricted areas. The etiology of several such syndromes has to be studied from region to region to identify the individual pathogenic agents in a given syndrome. The individual agents causing geographically prevalent syndromes vary because of host and environmental factors (e.g. poor sanitation and unsafe water) and vectors. The vectors (arthropods) or animal carriers (zoonotic hosts) are different in different geographic areas. Thus, the etiology of infectious syndromes differs between North and South America, between Africa and Asia, and distinctly between temperate and tropical climates. For example, an important cause of febrile illness in India is S. typhi, which causes typhoid fever, whereas in the Far East, the most frequent cause of febrile illness is Burkholderia pseudomallei, which causes melioidosis.In the context of geographic variation of pathogen and disease manifestation, one could cite the example of hantaviruses, which are widely distributed rodent-borne viruses. [47] This group of viruses can cause two important syndromes: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the Americas. [48] HFRS is a clinically distinct febrile illness, characterized by a hemorrhagic rash with renal dysfunction.Seoul virus is a hantavirus that is transmitted by domestic rats (Rattus rattus) and has a global distribution because of the movement of rats to new areas through international shipping. [49] The disease caused by Seoul virus infection, HFRS, therefore occurs around the globe. Sin Nombre virus and other New World hantaviruses are transmitted by rodents of the subfamily Sigmodontinae (New World rats and deer mice) [50, 51] and cause hantavirus cardiac pulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas. Andes virus is transmitted by long-tailed pygmy rice rats and causes a severe form of HCPS in South America. [52, 53] Hence, geographic region-specific data are vital before designing laboratory diagnostic tools. Another outstanding example of geographic variation is the absence of yellow fever virus, which is transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegyptii, in India. This vector is involved in transmission of both dengue virus and yellow fever virus in South America, whereas in India, the same species of mosquito is involved in transmission of dengue virus and certain other flaviviruses that are not common in South America. Interestingly, certain infectious agents are seen in geographically circumscribed areas -for example, Kyasunur forest disease is transmitted by hemophagous ticks and is seen only in the Shimoga district of Karnataka, India. [54] Similarly, Bartonella bacilliformis is transmitted by sandflies of genus Lutzomyia, causing Oroya fever, which is seen only in South America. [55] Rocky Mountain spotted fever is often considered endemic only in the US. [56] It is our premise that there is a need for epidemiologic surveillance data to determine the identity of infectious agents causing an infectious syndrome that is predominant in each region, so that assays for appropriate syndromic diagnosis can be developed.",
