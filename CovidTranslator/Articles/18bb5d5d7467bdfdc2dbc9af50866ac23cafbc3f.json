Although several factors have been related to HIV-1 infection resistance, the possible genetic mechanism underlying this resistance presently remains elusive [1, 2] . The most investigated genetic factor associated with HIV-1 infection resistance is the homozygous presence of a 32-bp deletion in CCR5 gene (CCR5 delta 32) [3] , i.e., the main co-receptor used by the macrophage (M)-tropic strain of the virus to infect peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",

            "text": "The dendritic cell receptor, DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-family. They can act as both cell-adhesion receptors and pathogen-recognition receptors and shares 77% amino acid identity [4] . They appear to have related and perhaps overlapping abilities to bind mannose, GlcNAc, and fucosecontaining ligands. These sugar-binding proteins have been ascribed multiple roles in the innate and adaptive immune response [5] . Both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR have been of considerable interest because of their ability to enhance infection of T cells by the HIV-1 and because of their interactions with glycoproteins found on the surface of other enveloped viruses [6] . As pathogen-recognition receptors, these lectins have been shown to recognize a vast range of microbes, some of which are of major public health importance. Indeed, DC-SIGN captures bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori, and certain Klebsiella pneumonia strains; viruses such as HIV-1, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, and SARS-coronavirus; and parasites like Leismania pifanoi and Schistosoma mansoni. With regard to DC-SIGNR, studies to date have shown an interaction with a variety of viruses, including HIV, hepatitis C virus [18] , Ebola virus [19] and coronavirus, as well as with the parasite S. mansoni [7] . Both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are organized into three domains: an N-terminal cytoplasmic region, a neck region containing seven tandem repeats of the 23 amino acid sequence, and a C-terminal domain with homology to Ctype lectins. This neck region presents high nucleotide identity between repeats, both within each molecule and between DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. It has been shown that this region plays a crucial role in the oligomerization and support of the carbohydrate-recognition domain, thus, influencing the pathogen-binding properties of these two receptors [8] [9] [10] . The neck region of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR may be important in determining the orientation of the carbohydrate-binding C-type lectin domain and may therefore have an impact on ligand specificity [5] . DC-SIGN may be important in facilitating intrauterine vertical transmission of HIV [11] . Recent data demonstrate the capacity of both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR to mediate cellular entry of Ebola virus both in cis and in trans [12] . In this context, the efficiency of the DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR in pathogen recognition and subsequent processing may have important consequences for the quality of host immune responses and consequent pathogen control and/or clearance.",

In contrast to DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR has considerable polymorphism in the neck region (tandem repeat domain of exon 4) which consists of three to nine repeats of a 69-base pair segment, with seven repeats being predominant in the general population [13] . Recent studies have provided evidence linking polymorphism in the neck of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection [15] . Heterozygous DC-SIGN individuals were shown to be at reduced risk of HIV-1 infection [14] . In some recent studies, DC-SIGNR homozygous 7/7 repeat in the neck region was associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 infection, whereas DC-SIGNR heterozygous 7/5 repeat was correlated with resistance to HIV-1 infection [15] , while earlier studies could not detect any association between DC-SIGNR repeat region polymorphism and HIV-1 infection [17] .

The strong difference in the neck region lengths between the two genes was consequently visible in the heterozygosity values: DC-SIGN exhibited an overall heterozygosity of only 0.38%, whereas DC-SIGNR presented a value of 48.85% (Table II) .

Genetic epidemiological cohort studies have shown that polymorphism in the genes encoding chemokine receptor CCR5 (i.e., CCR5 delta 32) is associated with resistance against acquiring HIV infection in HIV-1-exposed seronegative individuals. Homozygous CCR5 delta 32 accounts for the resistance to HIV-1 infection in a small proportion of HIV-1-exposed seronegative individuals, whereas major part of the resistance conferred to these individuals is still unknown and to be elucidative. The existence of exposed yet uninfected individuals suggests that natural and acquired immunity to HIV exists and is a major determinant of clinical outcome. Variation in human genes having innate antiviral function may contribute to these alterations in gene expression or protein function. In the present study, we analyzed the impact of the tandem repeat polymorphism in exon 4 of the DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR gene with respect to the inter-individual transmission of HIV-1 infection. All HIV-1-exposed seronegative individuals who were found to be CCR5 delta 32 negative were enrolled to study the effect of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR exon 4 variants against HIV-1 susceptibility. We found no significant differences with regard to the overall DC-SIGN allele/genotype frequencies in a group of HIV-1 seropositive (HSP) compared to HIV-1 seronegative (HSN) and HIV-1-exposed seronegative (HES) individuals. Thus, the DC-SIGN genotype does not seem to influence the host's susceptibility to the HIV-1 infection in North Indians. Whereas, Liu et al. [14] reported that heterozygous DC-SIGN reduced the risk of HIV-1 infection (3.2% in exposed seronegative individuals vs 0.0% in HIV-1 seropositive individuals; p=0.011). A likely explanation for this discrepancy may be because of variation in number of sample studied.",

Lichterfeld et al., in their comparison of 134 healthy volunteers and 391 HIV-1 seropositive individuals, did not detect any association between DC-SIGNR repeat-region polymorphism and HIV-1 transmission and clinical progression to AIDS [19] . The probable explanation for Lichterfeld's failure to detect any association between DC-SIGNR repeat-region polymorphisms and HIV-1 transmission is that the study did not include HIV-1-exposed seronegative groups as also suggested by Liu et al. [15] . Impact of DC-SIGNR repeat-region polymorphisms on clinical progression of HIV-1 seropositive patients to AIDS could not be done in the present study, as patients could not be classified on the basis of number of years of known seroprevalence without antiretroviral therapy and viral load (data not available). Recently, Liu et al. [15] reported that DC-SIGNR homozygous 7/7 repeat was associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 infection (17.5% in high-risk HIV-1 seronegative individuals vs 28.5% in HIV-1 seropositive individuals; p=0.0015), whereas the DC-SIGNR heterozygous 7/5 repeat tended to be correlated with resistance to HIV-1 infection (35.5% in high-risk HIV-1 seronegative individuals vs 27.6% in HIV-1 seropositive individuals; p=0.0291). Whereas in the present study, although homozygous 7/7 individuals were more frequent in HIV-1 seropositive (47.61%) than HSN group (41.2%, p=0.197) and HES (36.17%, p=0.135), no significant association could be established. This suggests the need for larger number of individuals to be studied. We also did not find any significant differences in heterozygous 7/5 repeat between different group studies. The discrepancy between these results may be partially explained by the number of individuals included in the studies and/or by the relative impact of the different populations.",

Moreover, five repeat in the neck region can, although, form stable tetramers, but with the least affinity to target molecule HIV-1 gp120 [22, 23] . The affinity enhancement displayed towards oligosaccharide is due, in part, to multiple binding modes at the primary calcium ion site, which provide both additional contacts and statistical enhancement of binding [21] . Gramberg et al. [20] showed that DC-SIGNR alleles with five or six repeat units in the neck domain are expressed efficiently and augment viral infection similarly to wild DC-SIGNR which contains seven repeat units [20] . There might be indirect mechanism, which accounts for an association of DC-SIGNR homozygous 5/5 repeat genotype with reduced risk of HIV-1 infection in North Indian individuals. Nonetheless, the mechanism whereby DC-SIGNR repeat region polymorphisms affect HIV-1 transmission remains an area for future study.",
