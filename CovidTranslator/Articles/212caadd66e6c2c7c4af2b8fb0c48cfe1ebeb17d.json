The bat was morphologically identifi ed as a Natterer's bat (M. nattererii). It was given mealworms and water ad libitum supplemented with minerals and vitamins. In February 2010, the bat began to act aggressively, directly approaching any moving object, vigorously trying to bite, and screaming ferociously. This agitated stage lasted for 7 days and was followed by general weakness, lethargy, and paralysis. After the fi rst 3 days of the clinical course, the bat stopped drinking and eating. Ten days after recognition of the fi rst clinical signs, the animal died.",

Also, of 63 Natterer's bats tested during 1999-2010 in a retrospective study, none tested positive for rabies (T. M\u00fcller et al., unpub. data). Germany is the only country where several bat species other than serotine bats, i.e., Pipistrellus nathusii, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, and Plecotus auritus, have been found infected with EBLV-1 during this study (T. M\u00fcller et al., unpub. data) , and this is the second discovery in recent years of a new lyssavirus species through routine passive bat rabies surveillance. Also, in 2007 a Daubenton's bat found on the ground was taken to a rehabilitation center, where it died and subsequently tested positive for EBLV-2 (7). In both cases, the person who took care of the animal had completed the full preexposure vaccination, as a required risk-mitigating measure. An encounter with a BBLV-infected Natterer's bat could lead to a fatal outcome because bat lyssaviruses have caused several human cases of infection (4) . In Europe, species conservation and research require the handling of bats by bat workers. During 2000-2010, a total of 37,140 handlings were recorded for the Natterer's bat (Bat Marking Centre, Saxon State Offi ce for Environment and Geology, Dresden, Germany), underlining the need for adequate prophylaxis for bat handlers. If one considers the close phylogenetic relationship between BBLV and EBLV-2, humans who receive rabies prophylaxis will likely be protected. However, recent studies of the antigenic relationships of lyssaviruses have shown the diffi culty of interpreting antigenic differences by using sequences alone (14). Thus, in vitro and in vivo cross-neutralization and protection studies with current anti-RABV vaccines are urgently required for assessing the public health risk posed by this new lyssavirus.",
