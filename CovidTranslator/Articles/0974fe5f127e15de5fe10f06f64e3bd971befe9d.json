Emerging infectious disease research was seen as most likely to yield scientific advancement and genomics research most likely to be funded by CIHR, according to the CIHR scale.

During the SARS outbreak of 2003, it was necessary to marshal virologists to identify the pathogen, make use of genomic technologies to characterize the agent, and to develop an unprecedented marriage of public health science and emergency management to push the rapid development of diagnostic tests and research on vaccines and other prevention strategies. 6, 7 The study identified that funders, in addition to scientists, need to work more closely with those practising public health. Front-line workers need to see the value of research in informing practice and be encouraged to participate in the formulation and conduct of research. Consultation indicated that a high priority, capacitybuilding initiative should be the development of a research consortium to define the BC research agenda and facilitate the funding and management of research projects in an integrated and coordinated way. To date, there have been early steps in forming a public health research consortium to discuss priorities and coordination of research among public health practition-ers, but mechanisms for connection to the broader research and practice community are still required. If BC and other local developments are successful, a national network such as the National Collaborating Centre for Infectious Diseases may be a necessary mechanism to coordinate activities across the country.",

The study calls for CIHR and its funding partners to support research in areas addressing the needs of public health practice, with a focus on prevention and control programs.
