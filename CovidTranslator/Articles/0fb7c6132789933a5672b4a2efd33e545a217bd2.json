Apart from its well-known antimalarial effects, the drug has interesting biochemical properties that might be applied against some viral infections. Chloroquine exerts direct antiviral effects, inhibiting pH-dependent steps of the replication of several viruses including members of the flaviviruses, retroviruses, and coronaviruses. Its best-studied effects are those against HIV replication, which are being tested in clinical trials. Moreover, chloroquine has immunomodulatory effects, suppressing the production/release of tumour necrosis factor \u2423 and interleukin 6, which mediate the inflammatory complications of several viral diseases. We review the available information on the effects of chloroquine on viral infections, raising the question of whether this old drug may experience a revival in the clinical management of viral diseases such as AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome, which afflict mankind in the era of globalisation.",

Specifically synthesised to be used as an antimalarial agent, chloroquine was subsequently shown to have immunomodulatory properties that have encouraged its application in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. For this specific pathology, chloroquine and its hydroxy-analogue hydroxychloroquine have represented a valid contribution to the available pharmacological tools, since they proved able to slow down the progress of the disease while showing limited toxicity. 1 Unfortunately, chloroquine is being gradually dismissed from antimalarial therapy and prophylaxis, due to the continuous emergence of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains. However, the tolerability, low cost, and immunomodulatory properties of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine are associated with biochemical effects that suggest a potential use in viral infections, some of whose symptoms may result from the inflammatory response. 2, 3 We raise the question of whether this old drug whose parent compound, quinine, was isolated in the late 19th century from the bark of the tropical cinchona tree, may experience a revival in the clinical management of viral diseases of the era of globalisation.",

Extracellularly, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine is present mostly in a protonated form that, due to its positive charge, is incapable of crossing the plasma membrane. However, the non-protonated portion can enter the intracellular compartment, where, in turn, it becomes protonated in a manner inversely proportional to the pH, according to the Henderson-Hasselbach law. It is thus not surprising that chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine is concentrated within acidic organelles such as the endosome, Golgi vesicles, and the lysosomes, where the pH is low and most chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine molecules are positively charged. 4 and/or through the action of the multidrug resistance protein MRP-1, a cell surface drug transporter belonging to the ATP-binding cassette family, which also includes the more thoroughly studied P-glycoprotein. [5] [6] [7] It is well established that weak bases, by increasing the pH of lysosomal and trans-Golgi network (TGN) vesicles, disrupt several enzymes including acid hydrolases and inhibit the post-translational modification of newly synthesised proteins. The chloroquine-mediated rise in endosomal pH modulates iron metabolism within human cells by impairing the endosomal release of iron from ferrated transferrin, thus decreasing the intracellular concentration of iron. This decrease in turn affects the function of several cellular enzymes involved in pathways leading to replication of cellular DNA and to expression of different genes. 8, 9 General mechanisms of viral inhibition by chloroquine Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine can impair the replication of several viruses by interacting with the endosome-mediated viral entry or the late stages of replication of enveloped viruses (figure 1).",

Finally, chloroquine induces the production of non-infectious retrovirus particles, as shown with the avian reticuloendotheliosis virus REV-A and with HIV-1. 17 The mechanism of inhibition seems to be inhibition of glycosylation of the envelope glycoproteins, as will be discussed below.",

The use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in rheumatic diseases and for antimalarial prophylaxis showed a low incidence of adverse events during chronic administration of this drug for periods of up to a few years.

This ability was shown either by overloading the cells with high concentrations of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine before the infection, 17,31 so as to mimic the drug build-up taking place in the tissues of patients subject to chronic treatment, or by keeping HIV-infected cells under constant incubation with concentrations of chloroquine detected in whole blood of individuals chronically treated with this drug. 32, 33 The anti-HIV activity of chloroquine has been shown not only in cell line models, but also in peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes 31,33 -ie, cell culture models in which cellular uptake of chloroquine is closer to the conditions occurring in vivo. Under these conditions, it was possible to obtain levels of inhibition of viral replication above 90%. That hydroxychloroquine has some antiviral activity in vivo has been reported by two phase II clinical trials. 34, 35 The first trial was a small randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled pilot study on 40 patients (20 patients per arm), 27 of them being antiretroviral treatmentnaive. Hydroxychloroquine administration for 8 weeks resulted in a mean 0\u00b76 log reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA copy numbers (p=0\u00b702) as well as in a decrease in interleukin 6 concentrations, whereas placebo did not have any effects on both HIV-1 RNA and interleukin 6. 34 The second trial was also a small randomised, double-blinded trial, comparing the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine with that of zidovudine monotherapy for 16 [7459]; mean log reduction 0\u00b76; p=0\u00b701). Since eight of 37 people in the zidovudine group, but none of the 35 individuals in the hydroxychloroquine group, showed an increase in the HIV-1 RNA levels and in the cultured virus levels during therapy, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that resistance to hydroxychloroquine may not easily develop as opposed to the well-known development of resistance to monotherapy with other antiretrovirals such as zidovudine. 35 The results of larger clinical trials will be necessary for an accurate analysis of any possible discrepancies between the effects of chloroquine in vitro and in HIV-infected individuals. Some of us have recently shown that chloroquine, at nontoxic, clinically achievable concentrations, has in-vitro activity against primary isolates belonging to different HIV-1 and HIV-2 clades. 33 The mechanism of the anti-HIV effects of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine is a reduction in the infectivity of newly produced virions (reviewed in Savarino et al 2 ). The antiviral effects of chloroquine are associated with the reduced production of the heavily glycosylated epitope 2G12, which is located on the gp120 envelope glycoprotein surface and is fundamental for virus infectivity. 33 These effects are likely to be attributed to the increased pH in TGN, which impairs the function of glycosyl-transferases involved in the post-translational processing of the HIV glycoproteins. 2, 17, 33 HIV glycosylation may therefore represent a new target for antiretroviral therapy. As viral envelope glycosylation is mediated by cellular enzymes, its inhibition may explain the broad spectrum of the in-vitro anti-HIV activity of chloroquine against all major subtypes of HIV-1 and HIV-2. 33 The effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine on cellular rather than viral enzymes may also result in a low propensity to resistance development.",

The use of chloroquine in combination with other antiretrovirals is theoretically supported by the observation that chloroquine also shows anti-HIV activity in vitro towards isolates from patients in therapeutic failure with a multidrug-resistant profile. 36 First, hydroxychloroquine has an additive in vitro anti-HIV effect to that of zidovudine. 37 Second, chloroquine exerts in vitro an additive anti-HIV-1 effect on the combinations of hydroxyurea plus didanosine or hydroxyurea plus zidovudine in T-cell lines, monocytes, and primary T-cells. 2, 38, 39 The didanosine/hydroxyurea/hydroxychloroquine combination, especially attractive for developing countries due to its low cost, was tested clinically in Singapore in an open study. Of the initial 22 patients who started the study, six were withdrawn due to non-compliance. In the remaining 16 patients, HIV-1 RNA plasma levels decreased by a mean of 1\u00b73 log at week 12 and 48. 40 In a smaller study, with didanosine/ hydroxyurea/chloroquine, HIV-1 RNA remained lowered by a mean of 2\u00b75 log after more than 96 weeks. 41 These open pilot studies do not yet allow a determination of the contribution of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine to the viral load drop. However, it can be concluded that the addition of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine to hydroxyurea and didanosine is potentially safe, thus encouraging the design of larger studies with multiple arms.",

The clinical worsening of individuals with SARS in week 2 is apparently unrelated to uncontrolled SARS coronavirus replication but may be related to immunopathological damage. 55 A model taking into account the role of proinflammatory cytokines could help interpret this event ( figure 3 ). This view is derived from the effects of the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), which shares with the SARS coronavirus the ability to cause a disease with similar histopathological features and symptomatology. 57 PRCV induces severe lung damage through immune-mediated mechanisms-ie, probably through an increase in the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u2423 and interleukin 6, whose role in inducing lung damage has been proved using adenoviral vectors in animal models. 58 On these grounds, we think that the associations between TNF\u2423 and interleukin 6 concentrations and disease severity should also be tested in stored samples from human patients with SARS. If confirmatory results are obtained, then, it would be reasonable to consider chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine to suppress TNF\u2423 and interleukin 6 production. For this purpose, efforts to develop an animal model for SARS would be welcome. Such a model would help to clarify the immunemediated component of the symptoms of the disease as well as in testing of chloroquine and other immunomodulatory drugs. These studies could also lay the groundwork for the suggestion that chloroquine be considered for the treatment of other viral infections which involve immunopathology.",

            "text": "The effects on HIV infection are the best studied among the antiviral effects of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and are being tested in clinical trials. The anti-HIV effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine is modest by itself but is, at least in vitro, additive or synergistic when combined with selected antiretrovirals. These in-vitro results warrant in-vivo confirmation in HIV-positive individuals by comparing the long-term antiviral effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy regimens with and without chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. If such studies provide encouraging results, they may lead to a strategy whereby co-administration of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine allows lower doses of antiretrovirals, lessening cost and possibly toxicity. Costlessening would of course be particularly welcome in developing countries. Moreover, the potential ability of chloroquine to inhibit the replication of drug-resistant viral isolates could be important in the treatment of drugexperienced HIV-positive patients who have developed multiple resistance to antiretroviral drugs and thus have limited therapeutic options. In the developing countries where malaria is endemic, the concomitant administration of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine to a highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen may result (at least where P falciparum is still susceptible to chloroquine) in a decreased incidence of malaria episodes that have adverse effects in HIVinfected people, especially during pregnancy. 60 Moreover, the anti-inflammatory properties of chloroquine may temper the noxious immune hyperactivation that is characteristic of HIV/AIDS. 61 Due to its broad spectrum of antiviral activity as well as to its suppressive effects on the production/release of TNF\u2423 and interleukin 6, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine may also find a place in the treatment of other viral infections characterised by symptoms associated with inflammatory processes and/or immune-hyperactivation. We believe that further study should be devoted to the inhibitory effects of chloroquine on the infectivity of flaviviruses, as one of the members of this family, the hepatitis C virus, is of great importance for human pathology and often co-infects individuals with HIV-1. Flaviviridae also include several arthropod-borne viruses such as the yellow fever virus and the West Nile virus, which has recently caused an epidemic in North America.",
