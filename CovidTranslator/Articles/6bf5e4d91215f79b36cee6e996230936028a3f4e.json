Initially the GFP gene was added to AMPV at all gene junctions in conjunction with the development of cassetted full length DNA AMPV copies. After recombinant virus had been recovered by reverse genetics, GFP positions supporting gene expression while maintaining virus viability in vitro, were determined. Subsequently, either S1 or nucleocapsid (N) genes of IBV were positioned between AMPV M and F genes, while later a bivalent recombinant was prepared by inserting S1 and N at AMPV MF and GL junctions respectively. Immunofluorescent antibody staining showed that all recombinants expressed the inserted IBV genes in vitro and furthermore, all recombinant viruses were found to be highly stable during serial passage. Eyedrop inoculation of chickens with some AMPV-IBV recombinants at one-day-old induced protection against virulent IBV QX challenge 3 weeks later, as assessed by greater motility of tracheal cilia from chickens receiving the recombinants. Nonetheless evidence of AMPV/IBV seroconversion, or major recombinant tracheal replication, were largely absent.",

The genome has 8 genes, with genome sizes typically close to 13.5 kb [7] . Reverse genetics (RG) systems for subtypes A and C have allowed their rational mutation [8, 9] . To date RG has produced viruses with deletions, gene modifications and reporter gene insertions [8, [10] [11] [12] .

A cloning cassette flanked by cut Sal 1 RE sites, allowing gene insertion and transcription, was ligated into each cut Xho1 RE site of the seven FLs. After cloning into STB12 cells (Invitrogen, according to manufacturer's recommendation (AMR)), the seven FLs were cut with Sal 1. GFP genes flanked by Xho1 sites were produced by high fidelity PCR using primers GFP ins+ and GFP ins neg (Table 1 ) and these were added to the seven FL cDNAs by ligation after Xho1 digestion. Colonies containing DNA of correct orientation and sequence were selected by sequencing. FLs containing GFP were recovered by RG [9] . GFP expression was assessed by fluorescence microscopy.

Conventional wisdom suggests that the minimal levels of upper respiratory tract replication detected in our study, led to the observed protection. Therefore any AMPV recombinant replicating better might yield greater protection. Growing worldwide commercial field evidence is indicating that subtype B AMPV better infects commercial chickens than subtype A. If a subtype B RG system becomes available, protection afforded by any resultant IBV recombinants will be keenly compared to the current study, which counter-intuitively suggests that recombinant AMPVs inducing the best protection replicate least well. If more protection inducing recombinants are found not to appreciably replicate in the respiratory tract or produce generalised seroconversion, it will become necessary to investigate whether replication might occur at another site or alternatively protection may result from a yet unrecognized mechanism. There is already some evidence that, AMPV replication in the respiratory tract of turkeys does not imply induction of AMPV protection [12] , protection following live vaccination does not require initial replication in the trachea [28] and AMPV vaccination can lead to apparent protection without AMPV seroconversion [29, 30] .",

For IBV, this is in marked contrast to conventional attenuation where more than 100 egg passages is typically required. Such AMPV recombinants would have greater genetic stability in two key respects. Firstly instability on simple passage implies that any live vaccine will be genetically heterogeneous. Of greater significance is the ability of IBV live vaccines to recombine with other IBV genotypes during co-infection, via homologous recombination, thus potentially leading to new field genotypes. In contrast, AMPV has been shown to be stable with respect to multiple passage while the absence (or extremely low frequency) of homologous recombination avoids recombinant generation.",
