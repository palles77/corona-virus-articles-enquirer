            "text": "Host-pathogen interactions are critical to the outcome of disease. The initial cellular recognition of pathogens by the pathogen recognition receptors (PRR) triggers downstream immune-related genes and rapidly sets up an overall immune response against the invading pathogen (Wang et al., 2007) . Whilst the resultant mileu of cytokines are paramount in the host protection from viruses such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), the upregulated cytokines also lead to inflammation at the sites of infection (Sladkova and Kostolansky, 2006; Kobasa et al., 2007) . The level of cytokine impact on the disease state is unclear. Infections such as dengue fever (Leong et al., 2007) , malaria (Clark et al., 2008) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Cameron et al., 2008) promote an inflammatory cytokine response during early infection which have been suggested to be responsible for cellular and organ damage. H5N1 infections in humans also leads to an increased inflammatory response and appears to contribute to the severity of disease and associated mortality (Tran et al., 2004; Chan et al., 2005; de Jong et al., 2006) . The H5N1-associated response includes the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, antiviral cytokines and interferons (IFNs) (Sladkova and Kostolansky, 2006) which inhibit viral replication (Szretter et al., 2007; Karpala et al., 2008) . However, the induction of some of the associated cytokines, like IFN, TNF\u2423, IL1\u2424 and IL6, are thought to be at least partially responsible for influenza-induced pathology (Cheung et al., 2002) .",

Whilst ducks often maintain a healthy state they enable the continuing spread of influenza by acting as a viral reservoir and then mingling with chicken flocks, and so ducks are critical to the control of the influenza cycle (Webster et al., 1992) . Research efforts show that humans and other animals, as well as chickens, suffer from high viral loads, extensive tissue tropism, and elevated immune responses following H5N1 infections (Cheung et al., 2002; Suzuki et al., 2009) whereas ducks often remain in good health, all the while continuing to shed virus (Alexander et al., 1986; Jeong et al., 2009) (LPAI) infection (Mundt et al., 2009; Cornelissen et al., 2012) . The lungs of the chicken, in contrast to ducks, endure high viral loads as well as high levels of IL6, type 1 IFNs, and PRR such as TLR3, TLR7 and Mda5 (Cornelissen et al., 2012) . Nevertheless, studies with mammals and avians show that viral loads and immune responses associated with HP-influenza infections are quite different when compared with LP-influenza infections (Tumpey et al., 2005) .",

In this study 2 H5N1 strains, derived from ducks, were used to infect chickens and ducks. The cytokine and acute phase immune responses were analyzed by observing the levels of IFN\u2425, SAA and the interleukins, IL1\u2424, IL6 and IL18. In addition, the levels of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) were examined as H5N1 viral RNA interacts with TLR7 (Stewart et al., 2012) which further activate innate immune responses (Geeraedts et al., 2008) . Vast differences were evident following HP-influenza infections in chickens and ducks. Furthermore, the findings were specific to HPinfluenza since LP-influenza H5N3 virus (Vc1462) did not induce similar responses in the chicken. It is hoped that a better understanding of these host-pathogen interactions might be helpful in deriving new immune modulation strategies aimed at reducing HP-influenza induced illness in chickens and humans.",

IL6 had the largest mRNA increases (heart 100-fold, spleen 80-fold and lung 70fold) compared to uninfected controls (Fig. 3) . The Ind109-infected chickens also had increased proinflammatory cytokine levels (IFN\u2425, IL1\u2424 and IL6) at 24 h.p.i. although IL6 increases were far less in Ind109-infected chickens compared to Vt453-infected chickens (Fig. 3) .

H5N1 antigen was prevalent in endothelium of all tissues and in occasional necrotic foci of various tissues, including spleen, brain, lung and liver. In lung tissue (Fig. 6B) , H5N1 antigen appeared throughout the parenchyma and around the epithelial cells of blood vessels. Serial sections of lung tissue were additionally stained with anti-IL6 antibody (Fig. 6C) and apparent co-localization of IL6 with H5N1 antigen was identified. Liver hepatocytes (Fig. 6D ) and sinusoidal cells (presumably endothelial cells) appeared necrotic and were positive for H5N1 antigen, mainly around the lesions observed (Fig. 6E ). Serial sections of the liver tissue, led to IL6 being additionally identified in the foci of necrotic lesions and confirmed that the elevated IL6 expression was co-localizing with H5N1 infected tissue.",

Additionally, various H5N1 influenza strains may have different clinical impacts in a specific animal (Perkins and Swayne, 2003) . Here we show initially that H5N1 (Vt453) infection is fatal to chickens within 24 h whereas duck fatality occurs in around 120 h. Additionally, whilst the H5N1 (Ind109) is fatal to chickens, ducks overcame the same infection. This indicates that a HP influenza virus in one avian species is not always HP in other avian species and supports previous findings that ducks have a lower fatality incidence following H5N1 infection (Alexander et al., 1986; Bingham et al., 2009) .

As expected, the lung tissue of H5N1-infected chickens had the highest viral titers (in excess of 7 log 10 TCID 50 ) and had correspondingly high levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Nevertheless, virus titers in the chicken spleen, heart and brain tissue were almost as high as those found in the lung. This intense viral replication and viremia may be promoted by excessive inflammation, which impacts on the permeability of blood vessels allowing greater viral spread. Swayne et al. (2007) have suggested altered vascular permeability to explain edema and hemorrhage, as contributing to systemic viral replication and subsequent multiple organ failure then death. Furthermore, SARS, Hepatitis and Mareks research identified that altered permeability of blood vessels contributed to pathogenesis (Swayne et al., 1988; Liao et al., 2004) although it's less clear if increased permeability was caused by inflammation or viral proteins.",

These increases appeared to be systemic since elevated levels were found in the lung, heart, spleen and brain. Both IL1\u2424 and IL6 regulate epithelial and vascular endothelial cells and have been implicated in influenza pathogenesis in humans and primates (Skoner et al., 1999) . IL6 may be released by influenza-damaged macrophages and epithelial cells (Hierholzer et al., 1998) . SARS virus induced disease severity has similarly been linked with IL6 in the lung environment . IHC showed that IL6 co-localized with H5N1-antigen and was highly associated with necrotic lesions in several tissues including Fig. 3 .

IFN\u2425 and IL18 were upregulated in the brain of Vt453-infected ducks and may explain the neurological symptoms observed in some ducks. The increased IL6 levels in the heart of ducks could also have influenced the severity of infection although only a 2-fold increase in IL6 was observed in sera of infected ducks contrasting the 10-fold increase seen in chickens.

RIG-I overexpression in vitro benefits the chicken response to influenza and its natural absence may explain poor in vivo immunity to H5N1 (Barber et al., 2010) . Clearly, the immune response is multifaceted and RIG-I alone may not protect an organism from influenza, especially since many organisms succumb to HPAI virus in the presence of RIG-I. What's more, both chickens and ducks overcame the LP H5N3 with only small increases in IFN\u2425, IL1\u2424, IL6 and SAA compared to the HP influenza viruses. Nevertheless future studies that investigate RIG-I-overexpression would be interesting for determining its protective functionality in vivo in HP-influenzainfected chickens. Fig. 4 . An increase in some cytokine levels occurs in duck heart and brain following H5N1 infection after 72 h. Cytokine mRNA levels of ducks 72 h after H5N1 infection were measured in various tissues by qPCR. Data represents the mean fold expression of duck mRNA relative to each uninfected tissue type after normalizing data to the housekeeping gene GAPDH (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). Other factors that may explain differential duck and chicken responses to influenza include viral modification of the immune system such as by influenza NS1 which blocks key cellular protective mechanisms (Rajput et al., 2012) . In particular, NS1 interacts with the RIG-like helicases further suggesting the importance of RIG-I for protecting influenza-infected organisms (R\u00fcckle et al., 2012) . Recently, a species-specific interaction of NS1 and the ubiquitinase trim25, were identified which might explain an organisms differential response to influenza since the NS1-trim25 impacts the RIG-like helicases (Rajsbaum et al., 2012) . Further research is required to delineate chicken and duck ubiquitinases as these are likely to have multiple cellular targets (Belgnaoui et al., 2012) . Another interesting observation that may explain duck protection from influenza may be rapid cell death of influenza infected cells, which limits virus spread, before the virus can become well established in the race for survival (Kuchipudi et al., 2012) .",

Research with H5N1-infected mice treated with the antiviral zanamivir showed that survival did not improve. However, when H5N1 infected mice were treated with a combination of an antiviral and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, inflammatory markers decreased by almost half and survival was improved significantly (Zheng et al., 2008) . Similarly, Imai et al. (2009) , suggested that the administration of ETR-P1, an anti-inflammatory, could protect 10-day-old chickens from H5N1 influenza infection.

Probes were labeled with the reporter dye carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and the quencher tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (TAMRA). Briefly, triplicate or more samples were each measured in 25 L reactions. PCR cycling was performed as follows: 95 \u2022 C for 15 s, 61 \u2022 C for 30 s and 68 \u2022 C for 30 s. Threshold values were set at a standard value (0.2) which corresponded to the midway point of the amplification plots. Relative gene expression was calculated using the mean values obtained with the arithmetic formula Ct (Applied Biosystems) as follows. Target gene Ct values were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a house-keeping gene, to derive the Ct. This was compared with an untreated calibrator to derive the Ct and relative gene quantitation, or fold expression relative to the untreated control (calibrator), was derived using 2 \u2212 Ct . Primer and probe sets were checked for efficiency by comparing the gradients of target and house keeping scores from 5 ten-fold dilutions of a reference and primer sequences can be seen in Table 1 . 4.7. Detection of IL6 activity in chicken and duck sera IL6 activity in chicken and duck plasma was measured by the ability to stimulate the proliferation of 7TD1 murine hybridoma cells in a 3H-thymidine incorporation assay.

Sections were quenched with 10% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min and digested with 5-7 mg/mL proteinase K for 6 min. They were then incubated for 1 h with either a rabbit serum directed against a recombinant-expressed purified H5N1 influenza virus nucleoprotein (produced by AAHL) or with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against IL6 (produced by AAHL). A secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (DAKO Envision) was then used for 45 min. Sections were finally stained with a commercial aminoethylcarbazol substrate chromogen (AEC) kit from DAKO Envision for 5-6 min, and counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin.",
