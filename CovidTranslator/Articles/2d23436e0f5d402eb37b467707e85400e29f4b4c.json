The children of VFRs, often born in the host country, are likely to be included in studies of VFRs. It can be difficult to compare studies because the population groups included may vary significantly depending on the definition used and on how the group was identified for study. In general, we are referring to ethnic travelers and their children who have immigrated but continue to have links with family and friends in their country of origin [7\u2022\u2022] . However, although we have defined the group we are interested in, identifying the specific reason for travel may be a challenge. Many travelers list more than one reason for their trip and may be combining tourism with a visit to friends and relatives [5, 8] . Studies may not always capture all VFRs.",

When these immigrants return to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives, they are at high risk of acquiring tropical infections, compared with other travelers. Immigrants who return to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives (VFRs) are more likely to travel to rural areas for long periods of time, to consume contaminated food and beverages, and to have more prolonged, intimate contact with local populations.

VFRs are more likely to travel with small children or while pregnant. They are also less likely to be deterred by pre-existing medical problems [2] . Once at their destination, most VFRs stay with family. This close contact with local population increases the risk of exposure to illnesses such as tuberculosis, hepatitis A and B, and meningitis. They are more likely to be visiting rural locations where malaria is readily transmitted, eating contaminated local food and drinking unpurified water, and using local transportation. These are all factors that increase the risk of exposure to an infectious disease or other medical problem such as trauma from a motor vehicle accident.",

Pretravel health advice is often not covered by national health services and therefore cost is often a significant barrier. VFRs may not be aware of the need for pretravel health advice or of their increased risk for infectious diseases [8] . They may believe they are immune to infectious diseases of their homeland and therefore do not require protection [4\u2022\u2022,10] . For some viral infections such as hepatitis A and Japanese encephalitis, this belief may be correct. However, many infections, such as malaria and typhoid fever, do not confer longlasting immunity. Furthermore, over time infections such as hepatitis A may decrease locally as the standard of living improves, whereas others, such as malaria, may increase because of drug resistance and environmental changes. Their belief that they are not at risk of travel-related infectious diseases may be extended to their children, who are often born in the new host country. These children, with no previous exposure, will have no immunity to these infections and are particularly vulnerable. Some VFRs who have concerns regarding immigration status may be reluctant or have difficulty accessing the health care system.",

The surveillance data from TropNetEurop shows that there were 963 cases of malaria in 2003, 831 of which were falciparum. Fifty-five percent of these cases occurred in foreign-born persons living in Europe. From 1985 to 1995, there were 77,683 total cases of malaria reported in Europe [24] . The data are cumulative with little breakdown provided regarding the background of the cases. An exception is Italy that noted an increase in imported malaria in immigrants from 14% in 1986 to 40% in 1991.

A study of 129 VFRs attending a pretravel clinic in Boston found that 95% were immune [41] . A prevalence study undertaken in the Netherlands showed an overall seroprevalence rate of 33.8%, with those of Turkish or Moroccan descent having more than 90% seropositivity [42] . However, the epidemiology of hepatitis A is changing. As socioeconomic standards improve in developing countries, the rates of hepatitis A seroprevalence are decreasing. One study in Latin America showed that anywhere from 20% to 70% of youth had no immunity. In India, Das et al. [43] showed that 41% of outpatients aged between 25 and 34 years at a New Delhi clinic were susceptible to hepatitis A. Therefore, those who immigrated when they were aged younger than 10 years can no longer be considered immune. The children of VFRs born in their host country will have rates of seroprevalence similar to those seen in the general population. Such travelers should be administered the hepatitis A vaccine before departure. Vaccination will prevent disease in VFRs and also prevent dissemination of infection into the local population after their return to their host country.",

            "text": "There are little published data regarding STIs in VFRs as a specific group. Most of the available data examine rates of STIs in immigrants. Data on HIV acquisition in the United Kingdom to March 2004 showed that 21,875 cases were acquired through heterosexual contact. Of these, 15,281 were acquired in Africa. The proportion of cases acquired through heterosexual contact has been increasing since 1999, and the majority of the cases were acquired overseas [44] . Fenton et al. [45] did a cross-sectional survey of 756 black Africans living in London. Travel to their home country had been undertaken by 43% of the men and 46% of the women. Forty percent of the men and 21% of the women indicated they had acquired a new sexual partner while away. Forty-two percent indicated that they had not used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. Respondents who had previous STIs and who had more than five sexual partners in the previous year were more likely to have acquired a new sexual partner while abroad. A report on an outbreak of syphilis in the United Kingdom in 2003 to 2004 identified 1775 cases. Most of the cases were in men who have sex with men. There were 370 cases in heterosexual males and 222 in women. Of these, 23% were acquired outside of the United Kingdom, with almost 50% of the cases in people from the Caribbean or Africa [46] . Overall, 14% to 25% of gonorrhea and syphilis cases diagnosed in Europe were acquired abroad. These data are for all travelers and not specific to VFRs; however, they do draw attention to the role of travelers in the local spread of STIs [31] . This raises significant public health issues that are of concern, such as the potential introduction of antibiotic-resistant strains of infections. In Asia, up to 40% of all strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae are resistant to quinolones. These strains were initially introduced into the United States by travelers but have now become endemic in California and Hawaii [47] . In North America and Europe, there is one main subtype of HIV-1 circulating. Infections with other subtypes of HIV brought in by immigrants or travelers have been documented, which may have implications for the generation of new recombinant viruses [48] . Strategies to attempt to modify sexual behaviors in VFRs while traveling will be a challenge because they will need to focus on individual cultural groups. To date, programs to change sexual behaviors in any particular group have not been a resounding success.",

One important reason for monitoring the health of returning travelers is to prevent local transmission of tropical diseases. Labbe et al. [49] demonstrated that monitoring malaria in returning travelers is an effective method of monitoring drug-resistant strains. Monitoring the health of returning travelers, and especially that of a high-risk group such as VFRs, is an important public health tool in the prevention of possible outbreaks. Returning travelers may provide an early warning sign of an outbreak in another part of the world. Although not strictly VFRs, Hajj pilgrims from industrialized countries have recently been shown to be at increased risk of meningococcal infection W-135. Despite being immunized before travel, infection was transmitted to household members after return [50] . Our recent experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome demonstrated how quickly an infection can travel around the world. The index case in Toronto was a VFR of Chinese descent and had been in Hong Kong visiting family. The outcome in Toronto, as in much of the world, was the rapid and frightening spread of a novel coronavirus [51] .",
