Moreover, two cellular nucleolar antigens, UBF 1 and B23.1, have been shown to be sequestered into viral DNA replication centers where they affect viral DNA replication (11) (12) (13) . Thus, there is clear evidence that adenovirus infection has a substantial impact on the composition and function of the nucleolus. What is not clear is whether the sequestration of cellular nucleolar antigens is limited to a small number of proteins or widespread. In addition, it is unclear whether adenovirus primarily modulates the nucleolus for replicative advantage or whether the effects on the nucleolus are a side effect of cellular proteins being sequestered into virally induced structures.",

Most of these have used 2D gel electrophoresis-based approaches with some success. For example, 2D electrophoresis was used to examine the total proteome of West Nile virus-infected cells, identifying about 100 different proteins, many of which were clearly upor down-regulated (27) . Much less common is the use of the more powerful quantitative MS coupled with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) technique to compare uninfected and infected cells. However, one study has investigated the composition of lipid rafts in hepatitis C virus-infected cells, identifying almost 1000 proteins (28) . Furthermore, quantitative MS/SILAC has been extensively used for proteomics analysis of the mammalian nucleolus under a range of conditions (29 -32) . Indeed, a key study examined the changes in composition of the nucleolus after inhibition of rRNA synthesis with actinomycin D (ActD), quantitating the effects on almost 500 proteins in the nucleolus (29) .",

The peak lists were generated by the Analyst QS software, version 1.1 (Applied Biosystems). The MS data were searched against the NCBInr database (February 19, 2006 release, 3,230,559 sequences searched) for Homo sapiens using the MASCOT search engine, version 1.9 (Matrix Science). Variable modifications used were carboxymethyl (Cys), oxidation (Met) and phospho (Ser, Thr, and Tyr) as well as the appropriate SILAC modifica-tions. Trypsin specificity was used, two missed cleavages were allowed, and a mass tolerance of 0.5 Da was used for both precursor and fragment ions. Peptide charges of \u03e91, \u03e92, and \u03e93 were selected. Individual ions with MASCOT scores higher than 20 were used, making sure the \"average peptide scores\" of all identified proteins exceeded 20, a threshold commonly used for confident protein identification from tandem MS data (36) . Only bold red peptides were also considered, effectively removed duplicate homologous proteins from the results. Under these conditions, the estimated false positive rate is less than 5%, according to a previous analysis (37) . SILAC quantitation was done by the MSQuant software, which measures the averaged MS peak areas of the isotopic pairs. Only proteins with bold red peptides and combined scores higher than 50 were quantitated. Proteins with heavy/light isotopic ratios lower than 0.01 were discarded; they mostly represented environmental contaminants. The S.D. of a protein ratio represented the variations among the measured peptide ratios for the same protein. Functional classification of the identified proteins was performed using Proteincenter (Proxeon). The biological reproducibility was addressed by a parallel 2D gel-based approach and by microscopy analysis (see below).",

RPL27-GFP was used as a nucleolar marker in live cells and in isolated nucleoli. At 18 h postinfection, the cells were harvested, and nucleoli were isolated using a standard protocol (29, 35) . As shown in supplemental Fig. 1 , live cell imaging revealed that the RPL27-GFP signal in the nucleolus of infected cells (supplemental Fig. 1C ) was similar to that in untreated cells (supplemental Fig. 1A ). The GFP signals in nucleoli isolated from untreated (supplemental Fig. 1B ) and infected (supplemental Fig. 1D ) cells were also similar, although the nucleoli from infected cells appeared slightly larger. Interestingly, adenovirus infection induced the appearance of RPL27-GFP in threadlike structures in the nucleoplasm. The significance of the accumulation of this ribosomal protein in these structures or the apparent slight enlargement of nucleoli is unknown.

Functional classification (Fig.  1A) revealed that the distribution of the functional roles of the detected proteins was similar to that of the previously reported human nucleolar proteome (29) , indicating that the nucleoli isolated in this study were of purity comparable to the nucleolar preparations used in our previous proteomics studies. Interestingly, no viral proteins were detected in the nucleoli of the virally infected cells using adenoviral genome data in MASCOT searches, potentially reflecting a lack of abundance at that time point. Fig. 1B shows the changes in abundance of the detected proteins in isolated nucleoli after viral infection. Remarkably, a majority of the nucleolar proteins remained relatively unaffected by viral infection; very few proteins exhibited significant changes in levels (more than \u03ee1-fold). A closer comparison of the nucleolar responses to viral infection and with previously reported data (29) on the effects of transcription inhibition by ActD is shown in Fig. 1C . The SILAC -fold changes of the nucleolar levels of selected proteins after viral inhibition and ActD treatment were very different, indicating that the human nucleolus reacts to these two perturbations in highly distinct manners. In particular, the effects of viral infection on components of the rRNA transcription machinery were distinct from the effects of ActD treatment. The SILAC ratios of ribosomal proteins showed a mild decrease after viral infection (Fig. 1D ), whereas ActD treatment had a significant impact on a number of ribosomal proteins.",

Moreover, although many of the proteins identified could conceivably play a role in adenovirus infection, we wanted to independently verify any potential changes in the nucleolar proteome. This would have a further key benefit of prioritizing future work relating these changes to function. We therefore used a range of antisera and tagged expression constructs to examine the fate of a number of proteins identified as being enriched or depleted in the nucleolus. We concentrated on those proteins for which reagents and published data on subcellular location were already available so we could be confident of their locations in uninfected cells. We compared the location of target antigens relative to adenovirus DBP, a key component of the adenovirus DNA replication machinery that is expressed to high levels in the nucleoplasm but not the nucleolus in virus-infected cells.

Fig.  3 shows the effects of infection on those proteins apparently depleted from the nucleolus during viral infection. Two nucleolar antigens, hPOP1 and Nopp140, were clearly depleted from the nucleolus (Fig. 3, A and B) . hPOP1 was sequestered from the nucleolus into a mottled pattern within the nucleoplasm and was excluded from the DBP-rich centers (Fig. 3A) .",

In addition, our data illustrate the benefits offered by confocal microscopy when assessing proteomics analysis of a subcellular fraction. We feel this combination of techniques is crucial for several reasons. First, viral infection may have unsuspected effects on the integrity of cellular compartments that could affect the fractionation process. Second, this combination enables targets identified by proteomics analysis to be prioritized for further in-depth analysis. Finally, a proportion of the proteins in our SILAC analysis were only identified by one peptide, and for these proteins further verification is important.",

For example, although transcription inhibition by ActD causes depletion of ribosomal proteins of the 40 S subunit and, to a lesser extent, the 60 S subunit (29) , this pattern was not observed in viral infection (Fig. 1D) . This was interesting because adenovirus has been shown to eventually affect ribosomal RNA export (2) .

Another example is U2AF 65 , a splicing factor known to play a role in splicing of adenovirus transcripts (52, 53) . Finally, exportin 5 is known to export adenovirus VA RNA, competing with cellular microRNA export and potentially modulating cellular protein expression (54) . The identification of these proteins by SILAC/MS analysis further validates our approach because they are all well established functional partners in adenovirus infection. This gives us confidence that some, if not all, of the novel proteins Novel Proteins Depleted from Nucleolus on Infection-Of those proteins examined that show a clear nucleolar localization in uninfected cells, all had a dramatic redistribution in infected cells. For example, hPOP1 is normally involved in rRNA processing (42, 55) , and its mislocalization may reflect data showing that adenovirus eventually inhibits rRNA processing during infection (2) . Nopp140 mislocalization also fits with these observations because it is a chaperone for small nucleolar RNA (56, 57) . However, its co-localization with UBF and DBP implies that it may be an accessory factor in viral DNA replication during viral infection. Notably, in interphase cells, UBF and Nopp140 are co-localized and are known to be recruited together (56) . RBM4 has been reported to be either predominantly nuclear or predominantly nucleolar, depending on experimental conditions (43, 58 -60) . In our hands, the protein was nucleolar in \u03fe80% of cells.

This suggests that exclusion of cell proteins from DBP-rich centers is not simply a nonspecific feature of the adenovirus-infected cell nucleoplasm. Moreover, hPOP1 was excluded from the DBP-rich centers but was clearly enriched in a mottled pattern distinct from Nopp140 and U2AF 65 for example.

We believe this demonstrates the utility of proteomics approaches to generate meaningful data sets that will help us understand the role of the nucleolus in viral infection and to uncover previously unsuspected effects on the host cell during viral infection. Indeed, subcellular fractionation of this sort coupled with confocal microscopy provides a powerful new tool for understanding viral host cell interactions in a broad context and is a positive step toward a systematic understanding of virus host cell interactions.",
