            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major infectious disease threat and include the pathogenic human pathogens of zoonotic origin: severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). Entry of CoVs into host cells is mediated by the viral spike (S) protein, which is structurally categorized as a class I viral fusion protein, within the same group as influenza virus and HIV. However, S proteins have two distinct cleavage sites that can be activated by a much wider range of proteases. The exact location of the CoV fusion peptide (FP) has been disputed. However, most evidence suggests that the domain immediately downstream of the S2\u2032 cleavage site is the FP (amino acids 798-818 SFIEDLLFNKVTLADAGFMKQY for SARS-CoV, FP1). In our previous electron spin resonance spectroscopic studies, the membrane-ordering effect of influenza virus, HIV, and Dengue virus FPs has been consistently observed. In this study, we used this effect as a criterion to identify and characterize the bona fide SARS-CoV FP. Our results indicate that both FP1 and the region immediately downstream (amino acids 816-835 KQYGECLGDINARDLICAQKF, FP2) induce significant membrane ordering. Furthermore, their effects are calcium dependent, which is consistent with in vivo data showing that calcium is required for SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed a direct interaction between calcium cations and both FPs. This Ca 2+ -dependency membrane ordering was not observed with influenza FP, indicating that the CoV FP exhibits a mechanistically different behavior. Membrane-ordering effects are greater and penetrate deeper into membranes when FP1 and FP2 act in a concerted manner, suggesting that they form an extended fusion \"platform.\"",

Because viral fusion is one of the first required steps of an enveloped virus infection, preventing it constitutes an attractive approach for the development of novel antiviral therapies. Viral membrane fusion also serves as a model for studying biological membrane fusion systems because of its relative simplicity. Compared to the more complex cellular synaptic vesicle membrane fusion system, which involves several proteins, only one type of glycoprotein, the viral fusion protein, is involved in the viral fusion process. For this reason, study of viral membrane fusion allows a focus on protein-lipid interactions and on biophysical aspects of the lipid bilayer during this process.",

Entry of CoVs into host cells is mediated by the viral spike (S) protein, which mediates both receptor binding (via the S1 domain) and membrane fusion (via the S2 domain). The S protein is categorized as a class I viral fusion protein, which includes the prototype envelope glycoprotein influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and the HIV envelope protein. However, the CoV S differs in several aspects from prototypical class I viral fusion proteins. While influenza virus and HIV envelope proteins are known to be activated via cleavage by host cell proteases, this occurs at a single, restricted site directly adjacent to the fusion peptide (FP). In contrast, CoVs typically have two distinct cleavage sites that can be activated by a much wider range of proteases, with the FP function being able to be modulated by changes in the cleavage site position relative to the FP. This gives CoVs unique flexibility in the ability to invade new cell types, tissues, and host species. Several segments located in proximity with the heptad repeats (HR) region and transmembrane domain of the S2 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein have been proposed and characterized as putative CoV FPs [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . The main objective of this work is to identify and characterize the bona fide CoV FP based on structural and functional analyses of peptide-lipid membrane interactions, using SARS-CoV S as a prototype. We have chosen SARS-CoV S as a model since most functional data are available with this virus. However, the FP is highly conserved across the very diverse CoV family, and so our findings would be directly applicable to all CoVs, including MERS-CoV as well as any novel viruses that are yet to emerge from their animal reservoir.",

However, identification of viral FPs is often difficult. While there are no universal definitions, FPs are generally fusion protein domains that insert into host membranes after proteolytic cleavage exposure and major conformational changes of the envelope glycoprotein, thus facilitating the initialization stage of membrane fusion. The flanking region of some FPs can also interact with membranes and have been shown to play an important role in the later stages of membrane fusion. Whether those flanking regions can be classified as FPs is still disputed. Also, the exact size of FPs is a matter of debate. For example, the length of the influenza FP is estimated to be 20 or 23 amino acids (aa), depending on the group that has characterized it [8] [9] [10] .",

            "text": "The identification of the location of the FP for the CoV S protein is particularly challenging because of the large size of the fusion protein and the presence of multiple cleavage sites. For SARS-CoV S, the S1/S2 cleavage site is located at residue R667 (R: arginine), and the S2\u2032 site is found at the R797 position [11] . Within the S2 fusion domain of SARS-CoV S protein, several regions have been proposed as FPs. These have been proposed based mainly on their hydrophobic amino acid content, and without functional experimental back-up. Using Wimley and White interfacial hydrophobicity analysis and peptide library scanning approaches, it has been suggested that the sequence corresponding to residues 770-788, located upstream of the S2\u2032 cleavage site, is a putative FP (AltFP1) and that the sequence composed of residues 873-888, found upstream of the HR1 heptad repeat region, forms an \"internal\" FP (IFP or AltFP2) [3, 4, 7] . In addition, a region located proximal to the transmembrane region, the pre-transmembrane region or PTM (aa 1185-1202) was also found to have membraneinteracting properties [3, 4] . It has been suggested that these segments within S2 work in concert to mediate the different steps of membrane fusion [4] . Most recently, these alternate protein segments have been subjected to structural characterization by NMR [and in some cases by electron spin resonance (ESR) and differential scanning calorimetry] [12, 13] . The \"FP\" and \"IFP\" regions as defined by Mahajan and Bhattacharya have an uncertain functional role. Importantly, they show only limited sequence homology across the Coronaviridae, which would be very unusual for a viral FP. However, we have shown in previous functional experiments that the sequence immediately downstream of the S2\u2032 site (798-815, FP1) is extremely well conserved among CoVs and possesses many features of a viral FP [14] .",

ESR spectroscopy is a powerful way to characterize FPs. We have successfully used ESR to study membrane structure modifications by insertion of various FPs, and consistently found that the FPs of HIV, influenza, and Dengue virus induce membrane ordering, that is, bilayer lipids becoming more ordered when the FP interacts with membranes [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . We also found as a control that non-fusogenic mutants of the respective FPs have a much reduced ordering effect on membranes [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Membrane ordering is critical for membrane fusion, as it reflects the dehydration effect, which removes the repulsive force between the opposing membranes and allows them to come into a proximal position before fusion can take place [23, 26] . Therefore, our approach provides a robust and reliable method to identify bona fide FPs. In this work, we have used this innovative approach to identify and characterize the CoV FP.",

In addition, our results show that FP1 and FP2 work cooperatively as a bipartite fusion \"platform\" within an extended FP (FP1_2). In the presence of calcium ions, both FPs showed stronger membrane ordering, which is consistent with our observations that both FPs exhibit strong calcium dependencies for their membrane fusion function as assessed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Finally, our in vitro data are consistent with in vivo assays showing the dependence of calcium cations for SARS-CoV S-mediated virus entry and fusion.

            "text": "Design of peptides used for biophysical analyses Viral FPs typically have low sequence conservation among different viral groupings. However, they are very well conserved within a given virus family. We have previously demonstrated that the SARS-CoV S region immediately downstream of the S2\u2032 cleavage site (SFIEDLLFNKVTLADAGF, referred to as FP1 here) was highly conserved among CoVs [14] . Furthermore, we have also shown that a pair of highly conserved cysteines (C822-C833) found downstream of FP1 is essential for the membrane fusion function along with core-associated residues D830 and L831 (the region downstream of FP1 and containing these residues is referred to as FP2 here) [5] . To validate these findings with more recent sequence information, we first performed a comprehensive protein sequence alignment analysis (Fig. 1a ) of the extended region corresponding to the FP1_2 fusion domain of SARS-CoV. These results are summarized in the Weblogo generated using the sequence alignment data (Fig. 1b) . The location of the FP1_2 segment in the context of a model structure of the SARS-CoV S protein monomer, which is based on MHV S structure, is highlighted in Fig. 1c . The analysis confirms and extends our earlier findings to all four characterized CoV genera with six invariant and eight highly conserved sites. Among the highly conserved and invariant sites is the LLF motif and the conserved cysteine pair previously found to be critical for membrane fusion by site-directed mutagenesis and functional assays [5, 14] .",

Alanine substitutions in the LLF motif of FP1 were shown to be fusion defective in our previous study, and so a LLF\u2794AAA modified peptide was also generated [14] . Other peptides previously proposed to be CoV FPs were synthesized, including an \"N-terminal FP\" that is immediately downstream of the SARS-CoV S1/S2 cleavage site (770-788, AltFP-A) and an internal FP (873-888, IFP or AltFP-B), as well as a negative control peptide that corresponds to the region downstream of IFP within the HR1 region (887-904, HRP). The synthesized FPs contain a C-terminal GGGKKKK hydrophilic tag sequence except HRP and FP1_2. The GGGKKKK tag sequence is used to increase the solubility of the peptides. This approach has been applied to other FPs previously and has been shown to have no effect on the function of FPs [24, 27, 28] . Here, in order to further demonstrate that it does not interfere with our ESR measurements on FP1, we synthesized a variant FP1 (pFP1) devoid of the C-terminal GGGKKKK tag. We also synthesized randomized sequence variants of FP1 and FP2 (rFP1 and rFP2, respectively), which have the same amino acid composition as FP1 and FP2 but with a shuffled arrangement of residues.",

Three spin labels were used: dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-tempo-choline (DPPTC) has a tempocholine headgroup and the spin is sensitive to changes of environment at the headgroup region; 5PC and 14PC have a doxyl group in the C5 or C14 position of the acyl chain, respectively (Fig. 1e) , and they are sensitive to the changes of environment in the hydrophobic acyl chain region at different depths. Using the NLSL program based on the microscopic order macroscopic disorder model (MOMD) [38, 39] , the order parameter of the spin can be extracted, which is correlated with the order of the membrane. Thus, the effect of peptide binding on the structure of the membrane can be monitored. These three spinlabeled lipids have been used in previous studies and their ability to detect changes in membrane structure has been validated [26, 40] . Our previous studies examined the effect of a various viral FPs, including those of influenza virus [21, 23] , HIV [24] , and Dengue virus [25] , as well as the FP of the ancestral eukaryotic gamete fusion protein HAP2 [25] . All of these peptides were found to induce membrane ordering in the headgroup region as well as in the shallow hydrophobic region of bilayers (i.e., 5PC).",

As shown in Fig. 2d and e, FP1_AAA has no effect on the membrane ordering for all three spin label positions. Thus, the membrane-ordering effect of FP1 we observed with ESR is in good agreement with previously determined functional fusogenicity data. To further validate that the membrane-ordering effect of FP1 we detect is not artificial, a randomized peptide (rFP1), which has the same amino acid composition as FP1 but with a shuffled sequence, was synthesized and its effect on lipid bilayer order was measured.

As shown in Fig. 4 , although both AltFP-A and AltFP-B increase membrane order of DPPTC and 5PC spin-labeled lipids, the effect is smaller than those seen for FP1 in two ways. First, the maximum changes of S 0 of both DPPTC and 5PC for AltFP-A (0.012 and 0.036, respectively) and AltFP-B (0.019 and 0.027, respectively) are smaller than those for FP1 (0.033 and 0.051, respectively). Second, when we fitted the S 0 -P/L ratio curve with a sigmoidal curve, the concentration of peptide that induces half of the maximal \u0394S 0 could be determined. For FP1, these concentrations for DPPTC and 5PC are 0.39% and 0.22%, respectively, which are significantly lower than those for AltFP-A (0.77% and 0.52%, respectively) and AltFP-B (0.75% and 0.58%, respectively). The results indicate that FP1 has a significantly higher activity than the other two peptides. Interestingly, we could not observe the change of S 0 of 14PC (not shown) for all peptides, although Basso et al. showed that the S 0 of 16PC was affected by both AltFP-A and AltFP-B in their 100% charged membranes. FPs of influenza virus and HIV insert into the membranes in a shallow manner, with no effect on 14PC spin-labeled lipids [21, 24] . Our results with the SARS-CoV FP1 show that it has a consistently higher membrane-ordering activity than AltFP-A and AltFP-B, suggesting that FP1 is more likely a bona fide FP. Furthermore, our biophysical data are in agreement with our previous sequence and functional analyses showing that conserved residues within FP1, particularly the LLF motif, are critical for membrane fusion [14] .",

During titration, a total of 300 \u03bcL 2 mM CaCl 2 in a pH 5 buffer (with 10 \u03bcL solution in each injection) was injected into a reaction cell containing 1 mL of FPs at 0.4 mM. The background caused by the dilution of CaCl 2 has been subtracted by using data from a control experiment that titrated CaCl 2 in a pH 5 buffer. Substantial heat absorbed during the titration was observed, with the heat absorbed saturating toward the end of the titration. As shown in Fig. 5b and Table 1B , when the heat versus molar ratio plot was fitted using a one-site model that assumes that all binding sites have the same binding affinity, we calculated the enthalpy change \u0394H = 4.67 kcal/mol, with binding constant K b = 3.76 \u00d7 10 4 M \u2212 1 and stoichiometry n = 0.92. From these parameters, we further calculated the free energy change \u0394G = \u2212 RTlnK b = 6.49 kcal/mol and \u2212 T\u0394S = \u0394G \u2212 \u0394H = \u2212 1.80 kcal/mol. The data show that the calcium-FP1 interaction is endothermic, and the binding ratio is one calcium per peptide. The reason for the endothermic reaction could be because the buffer solution (150 mM NaCl) contains significant amounts of Na + ions that could also interact with FP1 and that a stronger binding of Ca 2+ cations displaces bound Na + into the bulk solution. To test this hypothesis, we reduced the NaCl concentration to 50 mM and performed an ITC titration. However, the baselines of the titration curves we obtained were unstable, and we could not extract meaningful data. The reason for this result is unclear, but it is possible that the peptide requires a certain level of salt concentration to maintain its structure. We performed the same experiment with FP2 and FP1_2 ( Fig. 5c and  d) . As shown in Fig. 5c and Table 1B , like FP1, FP2 also exhibits an endothermic reaction with Ca 2+ , with a stoichiometry of n = 1.02, \u0394H = 5.94 kcal/mol, and K b = 2.34 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 . Furthermore, in the case of FP1_2, the stoichiometry is n = 1.70. The ITC experiments we conducted demonstrate strong evidence for direct calcium-FP interactions, with one Ca 2+ cation binding per FP1 or FP2.",

We generated murine leukemia virus pseudotyped viruses harboring full-length SARS-CoV S envelope glycoproteins and containing the luciferase reporter gene. These viral particles are pertinent surrogates of native enveloped viruses, as they recapitulate all entry steps governed by the heterologous (SARS-CoV S) fusion protein and allow for a quantitative measurement of infectivity thanks to the luciferase reporter expressed only in an infected cell [47] . We first performed an extracellular calcium ion depletion experiment in which Vero-E6 cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) with or without calcium ions, incubated with culture medium with or without calcium ions, and infected with pseudovirions in the presence or absence of the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Fig. 6a) . This assay shows that depletion of extracellular calcium cations significantly decreases SARS-CoV pseudotyped particle (SARSpp) infectivity, with a measured~2.9-fold decrease. As SARS-CoV is known to enter cells through the endocytic pathway, we then tested the effect of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032tetraacetic acid tetrakis (BAPTA-AM), a calciumspecific cell membrane-permeable chelator, to investigate the role of intracellular calcium on SARS-CoV virus entry (Fig. 6b and c) . We first assessed the effect of BAPTA-AM on cell viability (Fig. 6b) . Increasing concentrations of BAPTA-AM were incubated with Vero-E6 cells, which were then analyzed for cell viability using luminescence-based ATP quantitation assay. This analysis shows that cell viability is not significantly impacted up to the highest concentration tested of 50 \u03bcM. Upon depletion of intracellular calcium ions in Vero-E6 cells using a similar 50 \u03bcM BAPTA-AM treatment to that mentioned above, we observed a remarkable~60-fold decrease in SARSpp infectivity (Fig. 6c) . Taken together, our functional assays strongly support an important functional role played by Ca 2+ ions during viral fusion and entry of SARS-CoV.",

When the same amounts of total peptide were compared, the mixture of FP1 + FP2 increases S 0 of DPPTC to 0.47 when the total P/L is 2% (i.e., 1% FP1 and 1% FP2), which is higher than the S 0 for the 2% FP1 or 2% FP2 individual conditions. Also, the 5PC membrane ordering increases for the mixture of FP1 + FP2 are more noticeable, up to 0.61 at 2% total P/L ratio. Interestingly, although the mixture of FP1 + FP2 has no effect on 14PC, it has a small but observable membraneordering effect on 10PC (from 0.32 to 0.34; Fig. 7c ), which cannot be observed with FP1 or FP2 individually. Thus, the cooperativity of FP1 and FP2 not only allows for a greater membrane-ordering effect than the addition of FP1 or FP2 individually, but also enables a deeper reach within the lipid bilayer. , cell viability was measured using a luminescence-based ATP quantitation assay.

This observed membrane-ordering activity is correlated with the function of the FP, as the inactive LLF\u2794AAA mutant does not have such an effect. The membraneordering activity also depends on the correct amino acid sequence, because rFP1, which has the same residue composition as FP1 but in random order, does not induce membrane ordering. Correct folding of the peptide in the membrane is also an important parameter, as the LLF\u2794AAA mutant does not fold in the same way in the membrane as the FP1, as shown by CD spectroscopy and ITC. This finding is consistent with our previous studies on other viral FPs [21, 24, 25] . We further compared FP1's membrane ordering ability with those of two other proposed FPs AltFP-A and AltFP-B, and found that it has a higher activity than the other two. Our previous functional experiments on the SARS-CoV S protein suggest that FP1 possesses many features of an FP [14] , and the recently published cryo-electron microscopy structures of the different CoV S proteins, including that of SARS-CoV S, suggest that in its pre-fusion state, FP1 appears to be exposed at the surface of the glycoprotein's S2 domain [15, 19, 20] . Taken together, these data indicate that FP1 is more likely a bona fide FP for the SARS-CoV S protein.",

Comparatively, such an extended FP, consisting of 41 residues, is about twice the size of the influenza or HIV FPs (~20 residues). Both FP1 and FP2 possess membrane-ordering activity, and the extended FP (FP1_2) has only slightly higher membrane-ordering activity than that of individual FPs added together (FP1 + FP2).

Biophysical measurements performed in this work showed that the membrane-ordering activities of both FP1 and FP2 are only slightly affected by pH but are heavily dependent on calcium cations. We showed that the addition of EGTA eliminated the observed membrane-ordering effect. Furthermore, higher calcium concentrations were shown to enhance the membrane-ordering effect induced by both FP1 and FP2. The cooperativity of FP1 and FP2 is also calcium dependent. The ITC experiments on calcium-FP interactions not only demonstrated the interaction energy between calcium and both FP1 and FP2, but also showed that the stoichiometries are around 1 calcium cation per FP1 or FP2.

Calcium ions can also directly interact with fusion protein machineries, thereby activating their fusogenicity, and in such cases, membrane fusion is clearly calcium dependent. For example, in cellular SNARE-mediated synaptic vesicle fusion, calcium ions have been shown to be required activators for such fusion machinery [48] [49] [50] ; that is, without calcium ions present, membrane fusion does not take place. Thus, SNARE-mediated synaptic membrane fusion is considered to be calcium dependent whereby calcium ions are fusion activators. There are other situations in which calcium cations have been shown to interact with protein fusogens and enhance their fusogenicity, but without calcium, membrane fusion can still occur albeit at a reduced rate.

In such a case, calcium plays an indirect enhancing effect on membrane fusion. With HIV, calcium cations also enhance fusion, but such ions are not required, as HIV FP-mediated membrane fusion can still occur at a lower rate in the absence of calcium cations [51] .

The mixture was evacuated in a vacuum drier overnight to remove any trace of chloroform. To prepare MLVs, the lipids were resuspended and fully hydrated using 1 mL of pH 7 or pH 5 buffer (5 mM HEPES, 10 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7 or pH 5)] at room temperature for 2 h. To reconstitute FP1 without GGGKKKK in membrane, the desired amounts of peptide were dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2propanol (Sigma) and well mixed with the lipids in chloroform. The mixtures were dried and fully hydrated to generate the MLVs. To prepare SUVs for CD and ITC measurements, the lipids were resuspended in pH 7 or pH 5 buffer and sonicated in an ice bath for 20 min or when the suspension became clear. The SUV solution was then further clarified by ultracentrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min.",

The fitting strategy is described below. We employed the Budil et al. NLLS fitting program [39] to obtain convergence to optimum parameters. The g-tensor and A-tensor parameters used in the simulations were determined from rigid limit spectra [21] . In the simulation, we required a good fit with a small value of \u03c7 2 and also good agreement between the details of the final simulation and the experimental spectrum. Each experiment (and subsequent fit) was repeated 2 or 3 times to check reproducibility and estimate experimental uncertainty. Two sets of parameters that characterize the rotational diffusion of the nitroxide radical moiety in spin labels were generated. The first set is the rotational diffusion constants. R \u22a5 and R || are, respectively, the rates of rotation of the nitroxide moiety around a molecular axis perpendicular and parallel to the preferential orienting axis of the acyl chain. The second set consists of the ordering tensor parameters, S 0 and S 2 , which are defined as follows: S 0 = b D 2,00 N = b 1/2(3cos2\u03b8 \u2212 1 ) N, and S 2 = b D 2 , 0 2 + D 2 , 0 -2 N = b \u221a ( 3 / 2)sin2\u03b8cos2\u03c6 N, where D 2,00 , D 2,02 , and D 2,0-2 are the Wigner rotation matrix elements and \u03b8 and \u03c6 are the polar and azimuthal angles for the orientation of the rotating axes of the nitroxide bonded to the lipid relative to the director of the bilayer, that is, the preferential orientation of lipid molecules; the angular brackets imply ensemble averaging. S 0 and its uncertainty were then calculated in a well-known fashion from its definition and the dimensionless ordering potentials C 20 and C 22 and their uncertainties found in the fitting. The typical uncertainties we find for S 0 range from 1 to 5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3 , while the uncertainties from repeated experiments are 5-8 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3 or less than \u00b1 0.01. S 0 indicates how strongly the chain segment to which the nitroxide is attached is aligned along the normal to the lipid bilayer, which is strongly correlated with hydration/ dehydration of the lipid bilayers. As previously described, S 0 is the more important parameter for such studies [23, 54, 55] .",
