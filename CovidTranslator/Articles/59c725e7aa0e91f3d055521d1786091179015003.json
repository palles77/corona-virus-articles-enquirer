A previous study showed that the HPV16 HBE7 protein was primarily cytoplasmic while wild-type HPV16 E7 protein, termed HPV16 WE7, was concentrated in the nucleus. With the aim of studying the biological functions of HPV16 HBE7, the transforming potential of HPV16 HBE7 in NIH/3T3 cells was detected through observation of cell morphology, cell proliferation assay and anchorage-independent growth assay. The effect of HPV16 HBE7 on cell cycle was examined by flow cytometry. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RT-PCR were used to investigate the influence of HPV16 HBE7 protein on the expression of regulation factors associated with G1/S checkpoint. The results showed that HPV16 HBE7 protein, as well as HPV16 WE7 protein, held transformation activity. NIH/3T3 cells expressing HPV16 HBE7 could easily transition from G1 phase into S phase and expressed high level of cyclin A and cdc25A. These results indicated HPV16 mutant E7 protein, located in the cytoplasm, induces oncogenic transformation of NIH/3T3 cells via up-regulation of cyclin A and cdc25A.",

Moreover, HPV16 E7 can transform a variety of cell lines, including NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts (27) . The most well-characterized biochemical property of HPV16 E7 is its ability to bind to the unphosphorylated retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) and disrupt Rb-E2F complexes, resulting in a loss of the G1/S checkpoint (1, 7, 35, 38) . The HPV16 E7 protein is a 98-amino-acid nuclear phosphoprotein and can be divided into three main domains -CR1, aa 1-15; CR2, aa 16-37; and CR3, aa 38-98. All 3 domains are essential for the manifestation of the biological properties of E7 (33) . CR1 and CR2 mediate binding of the viral oncoproteins to an overlapping set of cellular proteins, including the product of the retinoblastoma gene (pRB), cyclin A and cyclin E (18, 24, 36) . The CR3 domain contains two \"CXXC\" sequences participating in Zn binding (9, 23) . It was reported that zinc finger structure at the C-terminal was essential for HPV16 E7 to stabilize its structure and biological function (30) .",

A mutant E7 (HPV16 HBE7) protein derived from a clinical HPV16 was isolated from Hubei province in China (16) . It was found that there were two mutations in HPV16 HBE7 ( GenBank accession no. AF393782). What is more, a non sense mutation was found in codon 43 which made HPV16 HBE7 into a truncated protein, corresponding to the first 43 amino acids of HPV16 WE7. Generally speaking, the great variance of gene structure in the virus will lead to changes of its immunological characteristics and its biological functions, for example, mutations leading to changes in the structure of coronaviruses produces changes in host range and virulence (27) . Previous research indicated that the HBE7 protein could induce mice to produce humoral immunity identical with the WE7 protein but with weaker specific cellular immunity (16) . The integrity of the C-terminal of the truncated HBE7 protein affects its intracellular localization (17) and may affect its transformation activity. This research shows that HPV16 HBE7 (the HPV16 E7 fragment), which is predominantly cytoplasmic, is also competent for transformation of NIH/3T3 cells and can efficiently activate expression of cyclin A and cdc25A.",

            "text": "The relative mRNA expression levels of each gene also contains the LXCXE sequence. Whether this sequence is also important for transformation by the truncated HBE7 requires further investigation.It is generally presumed that the main function of HPV16 E7 is to disrupt the cell cycle by promoting G1/S progression, thus establishing an environment that is more conducive for viral replication and subsequently promoting tumorigenesis (6, 13). The G1/S point involves the initiation of cellular DNA synthesis. Since DNA tumor viruses rely on the host's replication machinery to duplicate their own genome, infected cells must be shifted into S phase. The results in this study showed that the percentage of NIH/3T3-HBE7 cells in S phase was significant higher than that of NIH/3T3-vector or parental NIH/3T3 cells in S phase. It indicated that NIH/3T3 cells expressing HBE7 gene could more easily transit from G1 phase into S phase. HPV16 HBE7 held strong ability to promote the G1/S progression. It was consistent with this study that HPV16 HBE7 significantly increased the growth of NIH/3T3 cells.The promoter of the human cyclin A gene is silent during G1 phase and strongly induced as cells enter S phase(15). In this study, the activity of cyclin A promoter increased obviously in NIH/3T3-HBE7 cellscompared with NIH/3T3-vector cells. It demonstrated expression of HPV16 E7 in NIH/3T3 cells also induced transcription of the cyclin A promoter and that promoter activation was involved in the observed change in the level of cyclin A. The results above showed that cyclin A may be a critical target of HPV16 HBE7 in the disruption of the G1/S phase transition.As HPV16 HBE7 demonstrated a strong ability to promote the G1/S progression, we then investigated whether the levels of regulation factors associated with G1/S checkpoint were altered in NIH/3T3-HBE7 cells. HPV16 E7 has been reported to be associated with cyclin A and cyclin E. Cyclin A was believed to participate in DNA replication and may have a role in transcription control during S phase(14). Cyclin E was expressed in mid-G1 and rate-limiting for passage through G1(32). Cyclin E combines with cdk2 later in G1, and cyclin A associates with cdk2 at the beginning of S phase(8,28). cdc25A tyrosine phos-phatase was involved in the regulation of the G1/S phase transition by activating cyclin E-cdk2 and cyclin A-cdk2 complexes (2, 20). The results showed that the expression level of cyclin A and cdc25A in NIH/3T3-HBE7 cells was significantly higher than for NIH/3T3-WE7 cells. But there was no significant difference in the expression level of cyclin E and cdk2. These results indicated HPV16 HBE7 could upregulate expression level of cyclin A and cdc25A more effectively. As such, cyclin A and cdc25A were likely to be important mediators of HPV16 HBE7enforced cell cycle progression. However, the molecular mechanisms of HBE7 protein interacting with its intracellular ligands are not fully understood. In summary, this study showed that HPV16 HBE7 was primarily distributed in the cytoplasm and HPV16 HBE7 also held strong transformation activity. It could more easily transition from G1 phase into S phase and could up-regulate expression level of cyclin A and cdc25A more remarkably. These results indicated that activation of cyclin A and cdc25A was especially important for HPV16 HBE7-dependent transformation of NIH/3T3 cells. The effect and mechanisms of the HPV16 HBE7 gene in tumorigenicity are in further study. It could be important to the design of therapeutics and vaccines in Hubei province in China.",
