In this study, the crystallization and crystallographic analysis of MERS-CoV NP-NTD (amino acids 39-165), with a molecular weight of 14.7 kDa, are reported. MERS-CoV NP-NTD was crystallized at 293 K using PEG 3350 as a precipitant and a 94.5% complete native data set was collected from a cooled crystal at 77 K to 2.63 \u00c5 resolution with an overall R merge of 9.6%. The crystals were monoclinic and belonged to space group P2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 35.60, b = 109.64, c = 91.99 \u00c5 , = 101.22 .

In 2004, another alphacoronavirus, Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), was isolated from a seven-month-old child in the Netherlands suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis (Pyrc et al., 2004) . In 2005, Woo and coworkers discovered the novel betacoronavirus Human coronavirus HKU1 in patients with respiratory-tract infections . Recently, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been found in patients with severe acute respiratory-tract infections in the Middle East (Woo et al., 2014) . As is the case for all coronaviral infections, there are no efficacious therapies currently available against coronaviral diseases, making the development of anticoronaviral compounds a priority. The virion envelope surrounding the nucleocapsid contains the following structural proteins: S (spike), M (matrix), E (envelope) and N (nucleocapsid). Some of them have a third glycoprotein, HE (haemagglutinin-esterase), which is present in most alphacoronaviruses. The primary function of the HCoV N protein is to recognize a stretch of RNA that serves as a packaging signal and leads to the formation of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex during assembly . The RNP may be important in keeping the RNA in an ordered conformation suitable for replication and transcription of the viral genome (Lai, 2003; Nelson et al., 2000; Huang et al., 2004; Navas-Mart\u00edn & Weiss, 2004) . In addition, the N protein has been identified as an important diagnostic marker and the most ISSN 2053-230X",

Previous studies revealed that the N-terminal domain of CoV (NP-NTD) contains mostly positively charged residues, which are responsible for RNA binding, while the C-terminal domain (NP-CTD) mainly acts as an oligomerization module to form a capsid Saikatendu et al., 2007; Lo et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2013) . The central disordered region of the N protein has also been shown to contain an RNA-binding region (Chang et al., 2009) . We have shown that compounds that bind to the NP-NTD and interfere with NP-RNA interactions provide valuable leads for the development of anti-coronaviral therapeutics (Lin et al., 2014) . The crystal structures of several NP-NTDs, including those from SARS-CoV, Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), have been described Ma et al., 2010; Saikatendu et al., 2007; Jayaram et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2006; Fan et al., 2005) . In order to clarify the mechanism by which the N protein of MERS-CoV bind to nucleic acids, we have undertaken the determination of the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of MERS-CoV spanning residues 39-165, which shares 58% identity to NP-NTD of SARS-CoV. The results presented in this paper mainly concern the crystallization and preliminary X-ray structural analysis of MERS-CoV NP-NTD.",

Truncated forms of recombinant MERS-CoV NP-NTD were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of a pGENT plasmid encoding the N-protein gene using different primers. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and XhoI, and the DNA fragments were cloned into pET-28a (Novagen) using T4 ligase (NEB). Expression of the protein was initiated by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM followed by incubation at 10 C for 24 h. After harvesting the bacteria by centrifugation (8000 rev min \u00c01 , 12 min, 4 C), the bacterial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF pH 7.5) and lysed by sonication on ice using 3 s pulses with 6 s pauses for a total of 10 min. Soluble proteins were obtained from the supernatant after centrifugation (13 000 rev min \u00c01 , 40 min, 4 C). NP-NTD carrying an N-terminal His 6 tag fused to a SSGLVPRGSHM linker sequence was purified using an Ni-NTA column (Novagen) and eluted with a buffered imidazole gradient of 15-250 mM. Fractions containing pure protein were collected at $150 mM imidazole and were dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-buffered solution at pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl for 3 h at 4 C (Fig. 1) . The purified NP-NTD was further concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units and centrifuged at 3500g for 10 min at 4 C several times until the concentration of NP-NTD reached 10 mg ml \u00c01 as determined by the Bradford method (BioShop Canada Inc.).

The Matthews coefficient of 2.63 \u00c5 3 Da \u00c01 calculated using MATTHEWS_COEF from CCP4 (Winn et al., 2011; Matthews, 1968) suggested that there were four molecules in an asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 59.2%. A homology search for the MERS-CoV NP-NTD structure was performed using the BLAST server (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The model-selection criterion was based on the E-value and the estimated precision value. The sequence-alignment search indicated that MERS-CoV NP-NTD shares high identity with other NP-NTDs from coronaviruses ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). For example, the MERS-CoV NP-NTD (residues 39-165) has 58% sequence ",

The NTD from SARS-CoV (PDB entry 2ofz; Saikatendu et al., 2007) was chosen as the initial model as its E-value was 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c023 , and a total of 116 residues were modelled. The first molecular-replacement trial was performed using the PERON automated interface at the Protein Tectonics Platform (PTP), RIKEN SPring-8 Center, Japan (Sugahara et al., 2008) . The core of the model consisted of a tightly packed -sheet surrounded by large loops. The molecular-replacement method was then applied to the model using MOLREP (Vagin & Teplyakov, 2010) using reflections in the resolution range 8.5-3.0 \u00c5 . Single and unambiguous solutions for four NP-NTD molecules in one asymmetric unit were obtained in the rotation and translation functions, yielding a final correlation coefficient of 0.81 and an R factor of 0.32. Structural refinement of MERS-CoV NP-NTD is currently in progress. ",
