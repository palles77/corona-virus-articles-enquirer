            "text": "This paper employs a practice perspective to study and conceptualize supplier-switching processes in business relationships. It is based on case study research of a company in the international marine industry, which intended to switch one of its key suppliers for a new one as a result of cost-cutting strategies and dissatisfaction with the old supplier. The case study describes the process, which ended with the old supplier being only partially switched. The findings show how (partial) switching from one supplier to another happened via three key sub-processes and associated practices, which the involved actors in the case drew upon in the switching process: (1) initiationa process enabled by legitimizing and search practices; (2) substitutiona process enabled by transfer, translation, and transformation practices; and (3a) stabilizationa process enabled by institutionalizing practices; and (3b) restorationa process whereby the old supplier is retained as a result of new conditions, this retention being enabled by certain repair practices. By identifying the processes and practices that enable switching to happen, the findings offer an initial conceptualization of supplier-switching processes, which comprises an important and heretofore underexplored aspect of supplier switching. The research highlights the importance of recognizing how relationships embedded in interorganizational routines are produced and reproduced in the switching process through the actions and interactions of the actors involved.",

More recently, the ending-processes of supplier relationships have also received attention, both in the business-to-business (e.g. Alajoutsij\u00e4rvi et al., 2000; Halinen and T\u00e4htinen, 2002) and businessto-consumer relationships (e.g. Roos, 1999) . This paper investigates the switching aspect of the ending of business-tobusiness relationships, which refers to \"such endings where the supplier (or the customer) is substituted for another alternative. The emphasis of the term is on one actor's decisions and actions related to relationship ending as well as the actor's formation (or strengthening) of another relationship\" (T\u00e4htinen and Halinen, 2002, p. 183) .",

Previous studies of supplier-switching have focused primarily on the switching decision. Key driving forces for switching suppliers reported by researchers include a desire to reduce purchasing costs (Friedl and Wagner, 2012) , the desire for independence from a particular supplier (Geiger et al., 2012) , and dissatisfaction (Ferguson and Johnston, 2011) . However, the perceived costs of switching and the value of established relationships often preclude a buyer from switching (Geiger et al., 2012) . Switching costs can be attributed to the following factors: information asymmetry (Wagner and Friedl, 2007) ; partner-specific investments and asset specificity (Heide and Weiss, 1995; Wathne et al., 2001) ; previous adaptations and the creation of actor bonds, activity links, and resource ties (H\u00e5kansson and Snehota, 1995) ; and the embedded nature of relationships and existence of personal relationships (Granovetter, 1985) .",

As T\u00e4htinen and Havila (2013) observed, studies of termination tend to focus on the decision to end the relationship and not on the choice of initiating a new relationship to replace the first; it leaves the initiation of the new relationship \"in its shadow\" (p.12). Therefore, we lack knowledge of important aspects of the supplier-switching process. This paper addresses such gaps by providing insight into the processes of supplier-switching. It aims to answer the following research question: How do supplierswitching processes occur, and what actions and interactions do actors actually perform in this process?",

It illustrates both the ending of the old relationship and the initiation of the new relationship. Theoretically, the research is built on a practice perspective (e.g. Schatzki et al., 2001) , meaning a focus on what the involved actors actually do when they engage in the switching process, as well as the practices upon which they draw. One central assumption within the practice perspective is that social life is an ongoing production that emerges through people's recurrent actions and interactions (Feldman and Orlikowski, 2011) . Rather than focusing merely on the process itself, this perspective argues for delving into the everyday activities of people involved, and how these influence organizational processes and outcomes (Johnson et al., 2003) . Another central assumption is that these everyday actions and the social order (structures, institutions, routines, etc.) in which they take place are mutually constitutive, meaning that social regularities are always 'in the making' (Feldman and Orlikowski, 2011) . Therefore, focusing on practices means focusing on both structures and agency, not either or.",

As such, the research contributes to opening the black box of supplier-switching processes, and in doing so, extends existing research on supplier-switching, which has predominantly focused on identifying the variables that affect the supplier-switching decision and the different costs preventing the switch from taking place. The practice perspective also supports a deeper understanding of how supplier relationships are enacted by the people involved. Switching of supplier relationships involves a (re) enactment of structural conditions and day-to-day activities, such as the various interorganizational routines that make up relationships. In line with Whittington (2003) observation of organizational studies in general, studying what people really do in these relationships and how they engage in these routines, as well as how they go about the switching process, is an important step toward creating practical wisdom of supplier-switching processes.",

However, relationships are not static, but change over time. These developmental processes have been captured in several frameworks. For example, Dwyer et al. (1987) described the relationship development process through a linear model involving five distinct stages (awareness, exploration, expansion, commitment, and dissolution). Ring and Van de Ven (1994) , on the other hand, conceptualized this as a cyclical process, suggesting that difficulties in a relationship might just as well lead to reconciliation and new development as to dissolution (Vanpoucke et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "While the overall developmental processes have been conceptualized through different multi-stage and lifecycle models, the dissolution stage and termination of relationships have also been the subject of various models, even though empirical research in this field remains sparse (Pick, 2010) . In a conceptual paper, Halinen and identified the different stages in the business relationship-ending process: an assessment stage, in which the parties start to evaluate the relationship; a decisionmaking stage, during which the parties execute either a voice strategyto restore the relationshipor an exit strategy, to terminate it; and a dyadic communication stage, in which the parties use different strategies to communicate the potential ending. After this stage, if the parties have elected not to restore the relationship, it moves into a disengagement stage, during which business exchange starts to decline, and a network communication stage, at which the decision is communicated to other network actors. Finally, the ending reaches the aftermath stage, in which the parties jointly develop a narrative of the relationship to explain the dissolution within their respective companies and their networks. While this model explains how relationships end, it does not explain the process by which the ending of one relationship takes place at the same time as it is replaced with a new one; in other words, the switching process. Most of the research on dissolution of business relationships still focuses on the ending processes of the old relationship, and largely ignores the establishment of the new relationship (T\u00e4htinen and Havila, 2013) . However, switching refers not only to the conclusion of an existing relationship, but also to the establishment of a new one.",

            "text": "In recent years, supplier-switching in business relationships has received increasing attention in different fields: these include marketing (Heide and Weiss, 1995; Wathne et al., 2001; Ferguson and Johnston, 2011; Geiger et al., 2012) ; purchasing and supply management (Demski et al., 1987; Gadde and Mattson, 1987) ; and operations research (Wagner and Friedl, 2007; Friedl and Wagner, 2012) . Most of this literature has focused on the supplier-switching decision, and whether a buying firm should switch an existing supplier for a new one or instead choose to develop further the relationship with the old supplier (for example, Friedl and Wagner, 2012) . It is acknowledged that buyers are reluctant to switch suppliers, and that firms tend to maintain previous practices and decisions. Factors that have been found to influence the switching decision include a salesperson's customer orientation (Jones et al., 2003) , relationship equity (Low and Johnston, 2006) , customer dissatisfaction (Ferguson and Johnston, 2011) , and perceived relationship value (Geiger et al., 2012) . Another factor is information asymmetry (Wagner and Friedl, 2007) , which relates to an assumption of bounded rationality and the notion that even when actors attempt to behave rationally, they will encounter cognitive limitations. A lack of information about a potential new entrant's hidden characteristics (Wagner and Friedl, 2007) and uncertainty about the cost structures of both the incumbent supplier and the alternative supplier are likely to induce the buyer to retain an existing supplier (Friedl and Wagner, 2012) .",

            "text": "According to the literature, switching costswhich typically refer to a customer's perceived costs in switching suppliers (Campbell, 1985) are a key factor influencing the switching decision. An analysis based on transaction-cost economics indicates that a buyer would tend to stick with an existing supplier if the perceived transaction costs associated with the switch exceed the perceived benefits of finding a new supplier (Heide and Weiss, 1995) . Switching costs can be ascribed to prior commitment and partner-and transaction-specific investments (ibid.) such as physical assets, organizational procedures, employee training (Wathne et al., 2001) , technologies (Low and Johnston, 2006) , and the embedded nature of relationships (Granovetter, 1985) . Therefore, switching costs consist of both a hard-asset dimension, comprising investments in product modifications and dedicated plant facilities, and a soft-asset dimension, which relates to the quantity and quality of the working relationships between individuals from both parties and the communications system underpinning the interaction (Nielson, 1996) . According to Benito et al. (1999) , some switching costs are easily measurable, while others are less quantifiable, including outlays and expenses and the potential loss of more qualitative revenue and costs. Nielson (1996) found that investments in hard assets affect switching costs to a greater degree than soft investments do. He asserted that identifying the hard assets and assigning them an economic value is relatively straightforward compared to assessing soft assets, which are less tangible and harder to evaluate (ibid.).",

Benito et al. (1999, p. 222) noted that \"in order to take full advantage of an ongoing relationship, companies gradually adapt their organizational resources and routines to the specific needs of the relationship, which in turn represents a barrier to exit.\" Business relationships develop through exchange episodes that allow parties in a relationship to increase their mutual knowledge and experience (Ford et al., 2003) . In the exploration and development stages, in order to get to know each other, the parties engage in a detailed learning process to develop social, technical, and economic bonds (H\u00e5kansson, 1982) through coordination, adaptation, and integration (H\u00e5kansson and Snehota, 1995) . The resulting structure of connections reflects the parties' experiences with problem-solving and experimentation. Over time, routines are established that enable the interaction process and stimulate the relationship to mature (H\u00e5kansson, 1982) . These are valuable investments that make it worthwhile to continue a relationship, and avoid changes and switches (Gadde and Mattson, 1987) . Therefore, from the perspective of a customer, a high-involvement supplier relationship is \"both the impulse to development and the cage that imprisons it\" (Gadde and Snehota, 2000, p. 316) .",

A practice lens allows the authors to delve deep inside what goes on in an organization and examine the micro-level managerial activities and roles in producing processes and outcomes, such as supplier-switching. At the same time, however, a practice perspective acknowledges the connection between these actions and the structural conditions and larger social orders surrounding them (Whittington, 2006) .

For example, from this perspective a supplier relationship is seen as an active accomplishment, whereby its structural features are the result of the actors' recurrent actions and enduring interactions (Feldman and Orlikowski, 2011) . It acknowledges a link between the structure of a relationship and its enacted dimensions (Jarzabkowski et al., 2012) . As is the case with most organizational life (Nelson and Winter, 1982) , key structural features of business relationships, such as connections between activities and resources, are embedded in inter-firm routines (H\u00e5kansson and Snehota, 1995) . Routines have long been seen as fundamental, since they enable organizations both to accomplish work and to economize on scarce resources (March and Simon, 1958) . A routine is defined as \"a repetitive, recognizable pattern of interdependent actions, involving multiple actors\" (Feldman and Pentland, 2003, p. 96) . Traditionally, changes in routines were attributed to exogenous drivers, and considered to be \"mutations in the genes\" of the organization (Nelson and Winter, 1982) . Another possible cause of changes is dissatisfaction, which leads to modifications in behavior in order to achieve a desired aspiration level (Levitt and March, 1988) . However, routines have typically been seen as stable and as a basis for inaction (Levinthal and March, 1993) .",

Using a practice lens, these contributions have viewed routines as effortful and emergent accomplishments, which means that they can be reproduced in ways that are similar to existing routines or in ways that call for a more radical alteration of previously used routines (Feldman and Orlikowski, 2011 ). An important aspect of organizational routines is that they entail both an ostensive and a performative dimension (Feldman and Pentland, 2003) . The ostensive dimension refers to the abstract, generalized idea of the routinethe routine in principlewhich is easily transferred. The performative dimension refers to the actions of specific individuals that embody the routinethe routine in practiceand this, on the other hand, cannot be easily transferred. Taken together, the performative and ostensive dimensions allow for an understanding of routines as generative systems, which are created through a mutually constitutive and recursive relationship between the two dimensions (Feldman and Orlikowski, 2011) .",

This kind of knowledge transfer is aided by a pragmatic capacity to represent and model consequences of different actions, and these different approaches are useful under different circumstances. While reusing knowledge by transferring it across boundaries is helpful when the context is stable, novel situations require translation and transformation (ibid.).",

It offers an analytical framework to study these processes, which focuses on their internal life and the practices by which they are actually performed (Whittington, 2003) . The practice lens has two key implications for the study and the conceptualization of the supplier-switching process: first, it implies that it will be useful to examine how the relationships involved in the switchrelationship-specific knowledge, connections, and inter-firm routinesare produced and reproduced through the practices of actors; and second, it implies that these practices should be examined in detail, appreciating the connection between the involved actors' day-to-day activities and the structures in which they are embedded. The concept of routines is central in this respect. In sum, investigating the supplier-switching process from a practice perspective is likely to offer a valuable contribution to the understanding of relationship termination, which remains not very well understood (T\u00e4htinen and Havila, 2013) .",

The case was considered suitable as it reflected the phenomena under investigation (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007). The case represents a typical event (Yin, 2009) in which a northern European company in a mature industry (marine) decides to pursue low-cost purchasing effects by replacing a long-term relationship with a high-cost European supplier with a significantly less expensive producer in Asia. Therefore, even if the study of this particular case is not able to make general claims, the findings might be seen as transferrable to similar contexts. Transferability is a key aspect of trustworthiness, which in turn is a key quality criterion in qualitative research (Halld\u00f3rsson and Aastrup, 2003) .",

Given that switching processes are complex relational phenomena, rich descriptions were seen as important to provide in-depth understandings. This choice is in line with Johnson et al., (2003) , who argued that indepth studies are a necessary feature of micro-level explanations of organizations. These authors cited the significant contributions of small sample in-depth studies, particularly the seminal works by Henry Mintzberg (1977) and Andrew Pettigrew (1985) , in providing rich and enduring insight. Another example of single case studies are the studies by Jeffrey Dyer and colleagues of Toyota (e.g. Dyer and Nobeoka, 2000; Dyer and Hatch, 2006) , which have offered important insight into the strategies and inner life of the car manufacturer and how it deals with its supplier network. These types of studies have enabled the development of the holistic and contextual understanding that is essential to grasp the complexity of strategic change and stability (Johnson et al., 2003) . Thus, a longitudinal study of the particular case at hand was seen appropriate to provide new insight about the supplierswitching process. Based on the theoretical discussion earlier, such processes are poorly understood phenomena within the field of purchasing and supply management, and they are therefore suitable for case study inquiries, including single case studies (Dubois and Araujo, 2007) .",

Data were based on formal interviews, several hours of informal conversations during visits to the company's headquarters and international distribution center (IDC), observations in six supplier meetings, and the analysis of documents, including meeting memos, strategy documents, standard operating procedures, specifications, and e-mail correspondence. Several data sources were used to check the consistency of the data, and to help ensure the quality of the study (Eisenhardt, 1989) . In total, 28 semi-structured interviews were conducted (23 with representatives from the buying company, and five with people from the original supplier company), each lasting from 90 to 120 min.

However, analytical generalization is not automatic, and requires substantial commitment to theory to ensure the explanatory power of the case study (Dubois and Gadde, 2002) . Therefore, the data analysis relied on an abductive research logic, which means that theoretical and empirical insights were intertwined and informed each other (ibid.). The analysis started with the relationship as the unit of analysis, operationalized as connections between actors and their activities and resources embedded in inter-firm routines (H\u00e5kansson and Snehota, 1995) . However, it soon became apparent that the success of the supplier-switching process relied on the actors engaging in a number of routines and practices. Therefore, the unit of analysis changed to practices, which are defined as recurrent, materially mediated, and situated social activities (Schatzki et al., 2001) .",

Until early 2000, the supplier base was primarily located in Europe near the IDC, but at that time the company encountered a downturn in its markets, and needed to save money urgently. A new customer type had also arisen, involving companies that were most interested in the lowest possible prices. Top management urged the corporate purchasing department to find ways of reducing purchasing costs. They implemented a new sourcing strategy that focused on buying from low-cost countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. However, the product-technical and sales managers were reluctant to adopt this new strategy, arguing that it would harm the company's reputation as a high-end provider. Furthermore, the logistics were centered on the IDC, and buying from Asia was likely to increase the logistical costs and eventually force a change in the existing distribution system that had been in place for years. Nevertheless, Asia represented an attractive supplier market, and a significant portion of the sales were made to customers based in ports and shipyards in the same area. Therefore, the new strategy emphasized not only low costs, but also local sourcing.",

The combination of the new sourcing strategy and dissatisfaction with the supplier sparked the switching process. Therefore, the initiation was due both to endogenous reasons such as dissatisfaction, which is a common motive for switching (Ferguson and Johnston, 2011) , and reasons exogenous to the relationship, in that the competitive situation accentuated the need for cost savings.

This illustrates Ferguson and Johnston's (2011) point that different people in the buying company may act differently in their dissatisfaction responses. Top management issued a clear mandate to save overall company coststhereby ensuring competitiveness by reducing purchasing costs, particularly through low-cost sourcing. Few disputed the legitimacy of the need and the optimal means to the end, but still there was a job to do in terms of creating full commitment to the decision of switching the supplier of gas welding equipment.

A great deal of time and effort was expended to resolve product-technical issues concerning the right way to connect components and fit them together, and the product managers from the buying company had to go to China several times, since written instructions did not work very well. Furthermore, much of the production process at the Chinese facility relied on manual labor, and no proper quality-control system was in place. Another problem was that the new supplier was reluctant to invest in testing, which was an absolutely necessity for some of the products. The supplier viewed the buyer as a small customer and did not give them a high priority, and the supplier was at first reluctant to invest in expensive quality-assurance systems and test equipment.",

Quality remained an issue, and a qualitycontrol routine for shipments from China was incorporated into the IDC. The question now concerned whether the Chinese supplier should start delivering to other hubs in Asia, in addition to Europe. The costs inherent in the existing delivery structure, in which products were shipped from China to Europe and then back to Asian customers, could be offset to some extent by the low prices.

One reason for this was that the initial delivery problems with the new supplier prolonged the old relationship. However, the main reason was new safety requirements imposed on some of the products, which required complex product adaptation. The buyer did not consider the new supplier to be knowledgeable enough to achieve such modifications. As a result, new product development discussions took place with the old supplier, headed by the product-technical manager of the buying company and the sales manager of the old supplier, who had known each other for over 30 years and enjoyed a trusting relationship. These new commitments resulted in a restoration of the relationship, at least for the most complex parts of the product range. The actors engaged in direct interaction and meetings to reestablish the relationship and the connections (H\u00e5kansson and Snehota, 1995) . Product development discussions took place, and delivery and order routines were reinstated. No one perceived this as a problem since the old routines had always worked quite smoothly on both sides.

Literature contributions specific to switching have focused on the switching decision (e.g. Wagner and Friedl, 2007) . However, few researchers have investigated the dynamics of switching (Pfeiffer, 2010) , and what happens and what actors actually do in a move from one supplier to another (T\u00e4htinen and Havila, 2013) . The findings presented here provide insight into these processes and form a basis for developing an initial conceptualization of the supplier-switching process and the practices that enable it. This conceptualization includes not only the ending of the existing supplier relationship and the initiation of one with the new supplier, but also the process of substitution itself. Based on the findings from the current study, we may identify three key processes and associated practices that enabled the overall supplier-switching process. Fig. 1 illustrates the initial model of this supplier-switching process and the practices that are likely required for this process to happen. These practices are not merely something the actors do, but represent \"embodied arrays of activities organized around a practical understanding or 'way of doing'\" (Bj\u00f8rkeng et al., 2009, p.14) .",

As we learned from the findings section, actors in the case engaged in what we may term legitimizing and search practices. As in many other cases (Friedl and Wagner, 2012) , the switch in this case was motivated mainly by top management's focus on cutting costs, supported by the competitive situation, a new low-cost strategy, and a dedicated and professional procurement department. Dissatisfaction with the existing supplier also influenced the decision. Therefore, reasons both exogenous to the relationship (for example, the competitive situation) and endogenous to it (such as dissatisfaction) motivated the initial desire for switching. Despite a collective agreement to cut costs, legitimizing practices needed to occur in order to prepare for the switch. There was a general internal resistance toward buying from low-cost countries, and the perceived negative consequences for the company's reputation as a high-end supplier of quality products.",

However, the managers responsible soon succeeded in creating a shared view among the rest of the managers involved that the benefits would outweigh any such costs. The findings agree with much of the existing literature in regard to the switching decision, including results on cost considerations and the importance of previous investments. However, the case illustrates the practices actors employ in the initiation process, such as the importance of legitimizing. The second practice that was particularly important in this process was search practices. Since lack of real alternatives is likely to prevent the decision to end and switch a relationship (Ferguson and Johnston, 2011) , it was critical for the actors, such as the responsible procurement manager, to not only legitimize the switch, but also search for and identify real alternatives. In some respect, the search activities formed an important basis for the legitimizing practices.",

If we consider these contributions in more detail, the findings provide a basis for a conceptualization of the supplier-switching process (Fig. 1) , which focuses not on the development and termination of one relationship per se, but on the process (and the practices enabling them) in which one supplier is substituted for another . If we consider the first contribution, it is important to acknowledge that switching has been on the corporate agenda for decades. However, few studies have delved into the switching process itself. When the process is considered, there is a bias toward looking at the ending of the old relationship, while not much attention is given to the (simultaneous) initiation of the new relationship (T\u00e4htinen and Havila, 2013) . The extant supply management and marketing literature has dealt primarily with the supplier-switching decision and its associated costs, and often from a \"one-shot\" perspective (Pfeiffer, 2010) . The reasons for switching in our case were both endogenous (Ring and Van de Ven, 1994) , in terms of cost-cutting strategies and increasing dissatisfaction with supplier performance, and exogenous, in terms of a more fiercely fought, cost-focused competitive situation.",

In this case, the new corporate procurement office and the professional procurement managers were seen as key drivers of the switch. Over the years, with new \"business-oriented\" people becoming responsible, the personal relationships were weakened. Furthermore, the increased focus on formal measurement and monitoring of supplier performance revealed the performance problems, and use of this evidence in the negotiations further escalated the conflicts in the relationship. Social commitments on an individual level have proved just as important as economic considerations in explaining why companies are likely to preserve a relationship; breaking long-term relationships often causes psychological, emotional, and physical stress (Dwyer et al., 1987) . The case showed similar tendencies.",

            "text": "The case turned out to be a case of only partial switching, which is interesting. One reason for restoring parts of the old relationship was because changes in the surrounding network dictated new safety requirements and altered customer needs. According to Pick (2010) , there are few examples and little empirical knowledge about the impact of networks on customer recovery and the decision to restore a former relationship. In the case, we see that the new regulations in some ways compelled the customer firm to enter into new product development talks with the old supplier. In this way, the findings confirm that the relationship development process might be cyclical (Ring and Van de Ven, 1994) ; even if the relationship with the old supplier had gone through a stressful and problematic dissolution phase, the new product development discussion implied that the relationship went through new exploration and commitments. Therefore, contrary to Jap and Anderson (2007) , the findings suggest that the relationship enjoyed a fresh start, and that the \"psychological scars\" were not influencing the new discussions in a negative manner. The comment by the sales manager indicating that the intended dissolution was just about business, not anything personal, may explain this finding. This finding also expands insight into the trust dimension of relationships, and supports the contention that trust occurs at different levels and is embedded in the personal relationships between managers. The product development discussions took place between the product-technical manager of these products at the buying company and the sales manager, who enjoyed a trusting relationship. Certain business relationships might have different contact points, and while some actors may be dissatisfied and eager to switch, other actors might not share this point of view (Ferguson and Johnston, 2011) . The restoration process might also be explained by what Palmatier et al. (2013) referred to as \"commitment velocity\"; new commitments were established through the new product development discussions and investments, with the result that the old supplier was only partially replaced in the provision of equipment for the gas welding product range. This illustrates a central argument in the IMP perspective (e.g. H\u00e5kansson and Snehota, 1995) , which states that connections in long-term relationships bring opportunities for change and innovation. These established connections in activities and resources might explain why the old relationship in our case was restored; existing knowledge embedded in the products was vital to deal with the new safety requirements. This finding complies with previous literature on switching costs, referring to such connections as idiosyncratic and partner-/transaction-specific investments (Heide and Weiss, 1995; Wathne et al., 2001; Jap and Anderson, 2007) .",

The sub-processes comprising the overall supplier-switching process were enabled by different practices. As Jarzabkowski et al., (2007, p. 9 ) observed, practices might be seen as \"resources through which multiple actors are able to interact in order to socially accomplish collective activity.\" These involve both symbolic and material tools, and when they are utilized in routinized ways that form patterns, they may be studied to understand how organizational activities are constructed (ibid.). In other words, studying practices involved in the supplier-switching process in the case provided us with in-depth knowledge about how the switching activity was constructed, and insight into what brought about the change and the stabilizing dimensions. According to Ferguson and Johnston (2011) , individual members might play different roles in the process, and dissatisfaction responses depend on the influence they possess. In our case, we saw that the responsible procurement manager was the key promoter of the switch, while the product-technical managers were key opponents (Pick, 2010) . To overcome the resistance, the procurement manager used different legitimizing practices, including searching for alternatives and providing arguments for switching to the opposition. An important part of these influencing efforts was to involve the opponents in the switching process, creating buy-in and commitment to the decision.",

Business relationships are embedded into different interorganizational routines, including those for ordering, delivery, payments, and meetings. However, we know relatively little about interorganizational routines, as most of the routines literature deals with intra-organizational phenomena (an important exception being Zollo et al., 2002) . Similar to the previous notion about the intra-organizational switching routine, the interorganizational routines in the case were also produced and reproduced through a constitutive relationship between the structural features of the routines and the specific performance of those particular routines (Feldman and Pentland, 2003) . The case showed how the managers of the buying company considered the old relationship and the routines to be relatively standard and therefore easily transferable. However, despite similarities in the ostensive aspects, the switch required translating and transforming routines into the new context (Carlile, 2004) . For example, the delivery routine in the old and the new relationship had certain standard features, but the actual performance of this routine was based on knowledge of and adaptation to the particular relationship and its context. As people perform routines, they are always subject to change (Feldman, 2000) .",

Therefore, understanding the complexities of supplierswitching processes is important both from a customer and supplier perspective. A key managerial implication of the case study research presented in this paper is that managers should not underestimate the embedded nature of relationships, even in situations where the relationship is considered to be standard and \"business-as-usual.\" The study emphasizes the importance of looking beyond the routines in principle and in the abstract (the so-called ostensive aspects), and scrutinize the actual performance of these routines (the performative aspects).

These connections are not necessarily easy to identify; some people might have moved on, and the relationship might have been taken for granted. In addition, connections transcend the dyadic relationship to include third parties, such as other suppliers, sub-suppliers, and customers of both parties (H\u00e5kansson and Snehota, 1995) . For managers, this means that existing relationships must not be regarded too lightly in estimating the true costs of switching. Such connections represent significant switching costs that must be taken into account when considering the tradeoffs between the benefits and costs of switching. Another important implication is that these connections are not easily transferable across relationships. In the case, the managers initially considered the routines to be relatively similar. However, it is important for managers to recognize that such routines are enacted by people in their own specific contexts. Therefore, as the case demonstrates, managers need to engage in translation and transformation practices (Carlile, 2004) , including creating a shared understanding among the people involved in the switch and developing new knowledge of the new context, which the new relationship represents.",

            "text": "Even if switching is seen as a decision considered primarily from the point of view of buying firms, the findings also have implications for supplier companies. Suppliers need to understand the motives of their customers to switch, as well as the actions and interactions of the people involved in the switching process. In this particular case, the old supplier was only partially switched. This can be attributed to the product-specific knowledge that the supplier possessed and also to the existing personal relationships between managers in the two companies, as well as the supplier's behavior in helping out the customer when deliveries went awry with the new supplier. The scope of this study did not include considering \"win-back\" strategies on the supplier's behalf, but the research nevertheless suggests that suppliers should consider investing in technology and knowledge, particularly when facing competition from low-cost countries. Furthermore, as previous literature has emphasized, personal relationships are important (e.g. Nielson, 1996) . Using these relationships, and influencing managers of the customer company who are likely to be opponents of the switch, is one way in which a supplier might take action; another is by the response behavior in the process, as representatives of the buying firm voice their dissatisfaction (e.g. Ferguson and Johnston, 2011) . Pick (2010) noticed that, often, losing a customer is interpreted as a result of external forces and completely out of the control of the supplier. The findings from the research presented in this paper indicate that the supplier is able to influence the overall switching process.",

It is likely that the practice turn that is currently observed in contemporary social theory and general management and strategy research (Whittington, 2006) will be increasingly adopted in research within the traditions of business marketing, supply chain management, and purchasing and supply management. Looking at the micro-practices of the people involved, the dynamics of business relationshipsincluding switching processes and the decision of a buying company to substitute one supplier for an alternativeis likely to provide a fruitful avenue for future research. More specifically, future research could continue to test and refine the proposed process model of supplier-switching in business relationships across different organizations and business contexts. There are still many gaps to be filled in research on the ending of relationships (Pick, 2010) , and the switching process itself remains in the shadows (T\u00e4htinen and Havila, 2013) . The research presented in this paper is just a first attempt to delve into the micropractices of supplier-switching processes, bringing this important aspect of business relationships out into the light.
