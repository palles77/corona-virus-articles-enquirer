The magnitude of viral illnesses occurring during the Hajj has the potential for triggering an influenza pandemic. It appears prudent to consider all Hajj pilgrims as subjects at risk. The 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), which had little impact on pilgrims, led to recommendations for isolation, influenza testing, and definition of criteria for hospital admission [13] . No significant effect of the influenza vaccine or the use of personal protective measures against influenza was established in 2013 from observational studies, but vaccine uptake and adherence to facemasks and hand hygiene were reported as low [12] . Until better evidence is obtained, vaccination coupled with rapid antiviral treatment among symptomatic individuals remains the mainstay of prevention of influenza during the Hajj [12] . Following the official recommendations issued by the Saudi Ministry of Health in 2005, vaccination coverage for influenza increased to 100% by the year 2009, and thereafter remained above 80% in pilgrims from resource-rich countries [14] . A 10-year retrospective analysis of the incidence of influenza-like illness and influenza vaccine uptake among 33,213 pilgrims between 2005 and 2014 suggest that the incidence of influenza-like illness decreased as the vaccine coverage increased (relative risk = 0.2, P < 0.01) [15] .",

Severe (bilateral) community-acquired pneumonia was screened during the 2013 Hajj through sputum samples performed in all pilgrims admitted to 15 healthcare facilities in the cities of Makkah and Medina: respiratory pathogens were detected in 68% of sputum samples; 84% were positive for bacterial pathogens. H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were the predominant bacterial species (58% and 54% of positive samples, respectively), followed by Moraxella catarrhalis (36%) [17] . At least one third of pilgrims are at risk of pneumococcal disease because of age or pre-existing medical conditions. The pneumococcal carriage during the 2012 Hajj increased from 4.4% before to 7.5%. In 2012, non-susceptible isolates increased from 2.5% to 6.1%. Overall, 90% of infections observed are due to the serotypes covered by the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine as well as the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Despite the above knowledge, Saudi Arabia has not yet recommended pneumococcal vaccine for pilgrims, and the vaccination recommendation uptake greatly varies across pilgrims' countries of origin [18, 19] .",

The immune response to tuberculosis antigens evaluated by interferon-gamma release assay (Quanti-FERON TB) had increased three months after the 2002 Hajj in 10% (15/149 pilgrims) of Singaporean pilgrims, confirming that pilgrims were at high risk of acquiring M. tuberculosis during the Hajj [21] .

Similar results about acquisition of meningococcal serogroup W-135 carriage were observed in vaccinated Turkish Hajj pilgrims during the 2010 Hajj [27] . In 2010, the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia introduced the tetravalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine for all children and adults aged 2-65 years living within the Hajj perimeter, pilgrims, all healthcare workers and all government personnel serving the pilgrims in order to achieve a stronger and longer immune response and to reduce the carrier rate [28] .

The primary source of MERS-CoV remains unknown (bats are suspected) but there is increasing evidence of the presence of MERS antibodies in camels, pointing them as possible intermediate hosts [50, 51] . Clinical features of MERS range from asymptomatic or mild disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure resulting in death, especially in individuals presenting with underlying comorbidities. No specific drug treatment exists for MERS and infection prevention and control measures are crucial to prevent the infection from spreading in healthcare facilities [51] . On May 31st 2015, 1180 laboratory-confirmed cases (80% from Saudi Arabia) were reported by WHO, with a 40% case fatality [51] . Both community-acquired and hospital-acquired case patients were reported with a low rate of human-to-human transmission in the community. Although most cases of MERS occurred in Saudi Arabia and in the United Arab Emirates, case patients have been reported in Europe, the USA, and Asia in people who travelled from the Middle East or in their contacts [51] . Saudi Arabia is the only country to report new case patients every week, with 12 new case patients between October 17th and 24th 2015 [52], but no MERS-CoV case patient has been recorded in any of the pilgrimage areas during the Hajj since 2012 [53, 54] . Furthermore, if the prevalence of virus and bacteria increased between pre-and post-Hajj nasal specimens during the 2013 Hajj (7% and 15% to 45% and 31%, respectively), no MERS-coV nasal carriage was observed in a recent prospective study, with similar results, performed in French Hajj pilgrims [55, 56] . The estimated epidemic potential of MERS-CoV in Hajj pilgrims seems to be low, with 1 to 7 case patients per Hajj who will develop symptoms [57] . In France, microbiological investigations conducted in 221 individuals, from whom 7 contacts of confirmed cases and 51 individuals meeting the criteria for identifying suspected case patients, led to the confirmation of two case patients in May 2013 (1 death), with a secondary case of nosocomial transmission.
