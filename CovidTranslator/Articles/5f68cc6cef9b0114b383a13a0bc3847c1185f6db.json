The majority of study patients had serological evidence of SARS-CoV infection as determined by an in-house indirect immunofluoresence assay (Chan P K et al., 2004a) and of the few patients that died before a convalescent serum sample could be collected, SARS-CoV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR and/or virus isolation (Chan P K et al., 2004b) . HLA-A, B (Kennedy L J et al., 1997) and HLA-DR (Kimura A et al., 1992) typing was carried out using PCR and sequence specific oligonucleotide probes. The HLA gene frequencies for all the SARS patients (all of Chinese ethnic origin) were compared with a published control population of unrelated Hong Kong ethnic Chinese bone marrow donors (Chang Y W et al., 1997) and are shown in Table 1 ). For the Hong Kong Chinese bone marrow donors, HLA-A and -B typing was by serology and HLA-DRB1 from sequence based typing (Chang Y W et al., 1997) . There were no significant differences in HLA gene frequencies between the SARS infected and control groups. Further stratification on the basis of disease severity did not demonstrate any LETTER Influence of HLA gene polymorphisms on susceptibility and outcome post infection with the SARS-CoV virus significant differences between the severe SARS group (n=48, intensive care unit (ICU) and/ or death) and the mild SARS group (n=128, no ICU stay and mild symptoms) again compared with the control bone marrow donor cohort.",

Similar findings were reported for a SARS cohort from Guangdong in Southern China (Xiong P et al., 2008) . While this does not preclude such an association, the present data are fully consistent with the current view that susceptibility and outcome post infection with the SARS-CoV are more likely to be influenced by the innate inflammatory response and factors such as age and associated underlying illness (Peiris J S M et al., 2004) than the specific arm of the immune response. Issues of small sample numbers have the ability to bias interpretations and this has been noted by others (http:// (Ceppellini R et al., 1955) was used to calculate GF. Differences in allele number observed between cases and controls were evaluated using Fisher's exact test. P values were corrected for the number of observations made. No significant differences were observed. www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/16130/ title/Gene-Association-Studies-Typically-Wrong/) and it would be worthwhile to combine the various studies and perform a meta-analysis. While on-going studies to further understand the molecular details of the inflammatory and immune response to infection with the SARS-CoV are essential, it is important to remember and reinforce the public health message that the most effective tool in the fight against SARS is the same as that used against an age old infection like cholera, namely rapid tracing, identification and isolation of infected individuals and their contacts in order to limit the spread of the infectious agent.",
