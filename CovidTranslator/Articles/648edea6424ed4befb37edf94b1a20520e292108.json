We describe an outbreak of SARS in a chest ward of a medical center in southern Taiwan and seek to identify the risk factors of those SARS patients who required mechanical ventilation. We focus on previous health patients. Design: This retrospective case series was collected during the SARS outbreak. Degrees of severity were established, based on whether intubation and mechanical ventilation was necessary. Setting: A 2500-bed medical center in southern Taiwan. Patients: Forty-four patients exhibited symptoms that met the modified World Health Organization (WHO) definition of SARS. These included of three subgroups: healthcare workers (n=16), relatives (n=14), and patients already admitted for other ailments (n=14). Of these, 20 eventually required mechanical ventilation. Measurements and results: Laboratory analyses showed statistically significant differences between intubated and nonintubated patients in white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, and C-reactive protein level as well as in age and underlying malignancy. Risk factors for SARS patients who had been healthy prior to their illness included old age, high peak fever grade, increased neutrophil count, increased neutrophil percentage, and close or prolonged contact with a SARS patient. Conclusions: Old age, high white blood cell counts, high peak grade fever, and close or prolonged contact with a SARS pa-",

A novel coronavirus has been implicated with both the initial outbreak and the subsequent worldwide spread [4, 5, 6] . Cluster infections have been a common feature of SARS since its emergence [1, 2, 3]. In these clustered outbreaks some patients have progressed to respiratory failure while others have not deteriorated so markedly. The question of whether there are underlying factors that predispose to the eventual use of mechanical ventilation is important to address. In one study on 75 SARS patients the risk factors associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring ventilatory support were age, male sex, chronic hepatitis B virus carriage, raised creatinine, and recurrent fever [7] . Fowler et al. [8] reported 38 patients with SARSrelated critical illness. They described clinical course and outcomes of these critical ill patients. They also found that older age, a history of diabetes mellitus, admission tachycardia, and elevated creatine kinase were associated with poor outcome.",

A factor in the spread of the disease may have been the delay in diagnosis of the index case. This relates to the timing of the outbreak. At the time of the outbreak physicians generally lacked experience with SARS. All 13 inpatients presented an abnormal chest radiography before their SARS diagnosis. In several patients there was little change in chest radiography findings, even when their lung function had deteriorated to the extent that intubation was necessary. It was thus more difficult to make the diagnosis of SARS in these patients. Physicians must pay more attention and keep alert for early diagnosis of SARS in inpatient group. Our observations serve as a cautionary note to physicians that increased attention might well be paid to inpatients if SARS is to be recognized early. Early detection of the infection and rapid isolation of SARS patient as well as intensive respiratory precautions are proving to be critical in the control of a more widely disseminated infection.",

Diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer are more prevalent in older persons and are usually associated with secondary infections that influence WBC count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte percentage, and CRP level.

It is reasonable to presume that respiratory failure rate would be greater in this patient group given these other physiological stresses.
