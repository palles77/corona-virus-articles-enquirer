Compared with the AcMNPV-cell expression system, the BmNPV-silkworm system possesses better posttranslational processing and greater expression efficiency (Dojima et al., 2009; Usami et al., 2011 ). Previously, we successfully constructed a reBmBac system for recombinant BmNPV with increased efficiency (Liu et al., 2016) . By utilizing this system, researchers can proficiently and rapidly obtain recombinant baculoviruses and target proteins in silkworms.",

Type I IFNs are generated by almost any type of cell in response to invading pathogens (Alsharifi, Mullbacher, & Regner, 2008) . They can induce the expression of specific antiviral proteins and related physiological responses by binding with specific receptors on the cell membrane (Levy, Marie, & Durbin, 2011) . Type II IFNs possess strong immune regulation ability and can regulate the activity of lymphocytes (Muller et al., 1994; Platanias, 2005) . Type III IFNs have been recently discovered. They have functions similar to those of type I IFNs (Kotenko, 2011; Sheppard et al., 2003) . Some studies indicate that type I and II IFNs demonstrate synergy in the establishment of an antiviral state (Muller et al., 1994; Platanias, 2005; Sekellick, Lowenthal, O'Neil, & Marcus, 1998) .",

No corresponding immunoreactive protein was detected in the negative control sample from larval hemolymph infected with control BmNPV. Antiviral activity of recombinant IFNs was assayed utilizing a CPE inhibition assay with CEF cells. Recombinant IFN products could inhibit VSV-GFP infection in CEFs (Figure 3 ). The antiviral activity assay results indicated that the antiviral potential of reBm-C\u03b1, reBm-C\u03b3, and reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3 products were 3.26 \u00b1 0.61 \u00d7 10 6 IU/mL, 5.08 \u00b1 0.43 \u00d7 10 6 IU/mL, and 3.27 \u00b1 0.50 \u00d7 10 7 IU/mL in hemolymph, respectively. These recombinant baculovirus expression products were then acid (pH 2.0) and heat treated (56\u00b0C). IFN-\u03b1 is acid and heat resistant, but IFN-\u03b3 is acid and heat labile (Ho et al., 1975) . Therefore, the antiviral activity of the reBm-C\u03b1 product remained almost the same before and after treatment. The antiviral activity of the reBm-C\u03b3 product declined to an undetectable level. The antiviral activity of the reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3 product was still 5.78 \u00b1 0.88 \u00d7 10 6 IU/mL, which was due to IFN-\u03b1 activity. This activity was 2 times greater than that of the reBm-C\u03b1 product. This enhanced expression level of IFN-\u03b1 must be due to p10 gene deletion in coexpression recombinant baculovirus (Hitchman et al., 2010) .",

The type I IFN chIFN-\u03b1 gene was introduced at the polyhedron gene site. The chIFN-\u03b3 gene, a type II IFN-encoding gene, was inserted at the p10 gene site. The antiviral potential of the coexpression product was five to ten times higher than that of any single-expression product. After heat and acid treatment, the remaining IFN-\u03b1 antiviral activity of the coexpression product was approximately two times greater than that of the chIFN-\u03b1 single-expression product. This finding indicates that the expression level of IFN-\u03b1 in the reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3 product was significantly higher than that in the reBm-C\u03b1 product. ELISA results further augmented that multi-IFN expression in the coexpression product was higher than that in the single-expression product. This result was consistent with the antiviral assay. The increase in expression level is due to deletion of the p10 gene. Just like polyhedrin gene, p10 is a nonessential gene for baculovirus replication and budded virus production. And also, it is nonessential for recombinant protein expression, but with high expression level (Hitchman et al., 2010) .",

The saved cost of polyhedrin expression provides for the recombinant protein expression. In reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3, the deletion of p10 gene can also save a certain degree of cost of gene expression, even though the p10 promoter is weaker than the polyhedrin promoter. And these saving costs could be used for foreign gene The antiviral activity of the reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3 product was approximately 5-10 times greater than that of the reBm-C\u03b1 or reBm-C\u03b3 product. After acid and heat treatment (pH 2.0, 56\u00b0C), the antiviral activity of the reBm-C\u03b1 product was almost the same as that before the treatments. The antiviral activity of the treated reBm-C\u03b3 product was negligible. The antiviral activity of the treated reBm-C\u03b1\u03b3 product was greater than that of chIFN-\u03b1. It was approximately 1.7 times greater than that of the reBm-C\u03b1 product ily. This multigene baculovirus expression system can be a potential tool in many research fields. The BES is advantageous for antibody expression (Verma, Boleti, & George, 1998) . Previously, heavy-and light-chain genes were inserted in the same gene site (Furuta et al., 2010) . Using the multigene expression strategy in the present study, heavy-and light-chain genes can be introduced into different sites in one recombinant baculovirus, and enhanced expression levels will be achieved. rAAV packaging is another application area of the BES. In preceding studies, rAAV packaging required two or three recombinant baculoviruses, which individually contained cap, rep, and target genes (Aslanidi, Lamb, & Zolotukhin, 2009; Negrete et al., 2007) . By employing our multigene expression strategy, rep, cap, and target genes can be inserted separately into the same recombinant baculovirus at the egt, p10, and polyhedron gene sites, respectively. The packaging efficiency of rAAV would thus be greater than that when using two or three recombinant baculoviruses (Galibert & Merten, 2011) . ",

The chIFN-\u03b1 and chIFN-\u03b3 genes were codon optimized according to amino acid sequences (GenBank IDs: ADU60333.1 and ABI83735.1) and synthesized.

This finding also provides an optimal direction for enhanced expression levels. However, the antiviral assay against VSV and MDV showed that the antiviral potential of the coexpression product was more than two times greater than that of any single-expression product. This difference must be due to the synergistic effect of the two types of IFN. Type I and II IFNs display diverse antiviral mechanisms. Here, coadministration of these two IFNs ex-hibited synergistic effects and elevated antiviral potential. Hence, the coexpression of the two IFNs by employing the BES is significant and beneficial. The coexpression products displayed greater antiviral activity and synergistic effects than the single-expression products. This strategy of combined administration of chicken IFNs can suppress viral diseases in the poultry industry. The insertion of the chIFN-\u03b3 gene at the p10 gene site was mediated by the counterselection cassette rpsL-neo and phage \u03bb-Red recombinase. There was no fundamental sequence or antibiotic resistance gene residue in the target gene site of the baculoviral genome. By employing this method, multiple gene insertion into various gene sites in one recombinant baculovirus can be achieved eas-",
