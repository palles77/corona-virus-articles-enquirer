In addition, all 65 poliomyelitis eradication offi cers in Angola, of whom six are international and the rest nationals, organised mobile teams for active surveillance in provinces at risk outside the outbreak zone to investigate and report suspect cases.",

This system, which is constantly monitored for performance against international surveillance standards, provides a structure for rapidly detecting and responding to diseases of national and international importance, and in some resource-poor countries in Africa and south Asia is the most reliable surveillance and response mechanism available.",

            "text": "A new global immunisation vision and strategy WHO The widespread establishment of immunisation programmes over the past 30 years has provided remarkable achievements. Smallpox was eradicated, the worldwide incidence of poliomyelitis has dropped 99% since 1988, 1 and more than 2 million children's deaths from diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and measles are prevented each year (fi gure). 2,3 Hepatitis B vaccination could annually prevent an additional 600 000 future deaths (from liver cirrhosis and hepatoma). 4 More than 75% of children younger than 1 year of age receive three doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, and at least one dose of measles vaccine. 5 Despite such success, serious challenges remain. In 2002, an estimated 1\u00b74 million children-13% of the 10\u00b75 million children who die each year (2000-03) 6 -died of diseases preventable with widely available vaccines for pertussis, measles, tetanus, Haemophilus infl uenzae type b, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, and yellow fever. 7 More eff orts are needed to immunise the un-immunised and save lives.Immunisation can substantially contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, 8 especially Goal 4, which calls for a reduction by two-thirds of under-5 mortality by 2015. 8 Improving services to deliver traditional vaccines will reduce the 13% of child deaths mentioned above. Introducing new vaccines will help to prevent some of the 1\u00b71 million (10%) child deaths attributed to pneumococcal disease, meningococcal disease, and rotavirus. 7 In 72 of the world's poorest countries-those with income per head of less than US$1000-reaching more children and introducing new vaccines will require more resources, as immunisation costs rise from $2\u00b75 billion a year in 2005 to more than $4 billion a year by 2015. More than 40 million deaths can be prevented over the next decade, at a cost of under $1000 a life saved.Against this background, WHO and UNICEF are joining forces, and have developed the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy 2006-2015 (GIVS). 9 Both the World Health Assembly, 10 and UNICEF's Executive Board 11 recently welcomed the GIVS document as the framework for strengthening national immunisation programmes in the next decade. GIVS outlines four major strategic areas; we discuss each in turn.",
