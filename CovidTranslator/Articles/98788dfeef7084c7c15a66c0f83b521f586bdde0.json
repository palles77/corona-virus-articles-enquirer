            "text": "Virus-induced apoptosis is thought to be the primary mechanism of cell death following reovirus infection. Induction of cell death following reovirus infection is initiated by the incoming viral capsid proteins during cell entry and occurs via NF-B-dependent activation of classical apoptotic pathways. Prototype reovirus strain T3D displays a higher cell-killing potential than strain T1L. To investigate how signaling pathways initiated by T3D and T1L differ, we methodically analyzed cell death pathways activated by these two viruses in L929 cells. We found that T3D activates NF-B, initiator caspases, and effector caspases to a significantly greater extent than T1L. Surprisingly, blockade of NF-B or caspases did not affect T3D-induced cell death. Cell death following T3D infection resulted in a reduction in cellular ATP levels and was sensitive to inhibition of the kinase activity of receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1). Furthermore, membranes of T3D-infected cells were compromised. Based on the dispensability of caspases, a requirement for RIP1 kinase function, and the physiological status of infected cells, we conclude that reovirus can also induce an alternate, necrotic form of cell death described as necroptosis. We also found that induction of necroptosis requires synthesis of viral RNA or proteins, a step distinct from that necessary for the induction of apoptosis.",

Though both apoptosis and necrosis function to limit viral infection, they each have markedly different effects on the cell. While apoptosis results in membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation, the integrity of the plasma membrane is maintained (3) . In contrast, necrosis results in cell rounding, cell swelling, and ultimately a loss of plasma membrane integrity, leading to the leakage of host cytoplasmic contents (3) . In addition to the morphological differences in dying cells, apoptosis and necrosis also influence host physiology in a distinct manner. While cells dying by apoptosis do not activate the immune system, the leakiness of necrotic cells recruits immune cells and promotes inflammation (4), potentially enhancing pathology associated with cell death. Though necrosis was generally considered to be an unregulated, uncontrolled form of cell death, recent evidence indicates that at least one form of necrosis, necroptosis, is programmed (5) . In addition to the leakiness of membranes observed in all forms of necrosis, necroptosis is characterized by the activation of signaling from death receptors, the dispensability of caspase activity, and a requirement for the kinase activity of recep-tor interacting protein 1 (RIP1 or RIPK1) or 3 (RIP3 or RIPK3) (3) . Though both apoptosis and necroptosis have been shown to occur during viral infection, it is not known if similar events in viral infection trigger apoptosis and necroptosis (1) . Conditions that favor one form of cell death over the other during viral infection are also not understood.",

This induction process involves the IB kinase (IKK)-mediated activation of the classical form of the transcription factor NF-B, comprised of RelA and p50 subunits (20, 21) . Activation of NF-B early following infection is required for the cleavage of the BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family of mitochondrial proteins, Bid, via the initiator caspase, caspase-8 (14, 22) . The cleaved form of Bid, truncated Bid (tBid), amplifies the apoptotic signal through the mitochondria to activate the initiator caspase, caspase-9 (23) (24) (25) . These events result in activation of the effector caspase, caspase-3, and culminate in cell death.

In this study, we investigated how T3 and T1 reovirus strains differ in their capacity to evoke cell death. We found that T3D activates NF-B, initiator caspases, and effector caspases to a greater extent than T1L. Unexpectedly, when T3D-induced NF-B activation was inhibited, it did not diminish cell death. Caspase inhibitors also failed to block reovirus-induced cell death. Blockade of the kinase activity of RIP1 resulted in a reduction in cell death. Because reovirus-induced cell death in L929 cells fulfills all the criteria that are used to describe necroptosis-activation of death signaling, dispensability of active caspases, the requirement for RIP1 kinase activity, diminishment of cellular ATP levels, and membrane permeability of dying cells (3)-our findings indicate that reovirus is also capable of killing cells by necroptosis. Moreover, we found that induction of this form of cell death following reovirus infection requires de novo synthesis of viral mRNA and proteins. These studies therefore highlight a second mechanism by which reovirus infection interfaces with host signal transduction pathways to evoke cell death.",

Previous studies have suggested that blockade of the prosurvival function of NF-B by T3A but not T1L late following infection controls the differences in the capacity of these two strains to elicit apoptosis (34) . While following up on these studies, we investigated the extent to which T1L and T3D differ in their capacity to block activation of NF-B at late times following infection of L929 cells. We found that each strain inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423)-induced NF-B nuclear translocation to an equivalent extent (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). To determine if T3D and T1L continue to maintain a difference in their capacity to evoke cell death, we performed acridine orange, ethidium bromide (AOEB) staining on infected cells at 48 h after infection. Rather than subjective determination of the staining pattern of the nuclear material to distinguish between apoptotic and necrotic cells (35) , all cells that stained with EB were counted as dead cells. Evaluation by this method indicated that T3D induced significantly greater cell death than T1L (Fig. 1A) , consistent with previous results (30, 31) . Both T1L and T3D were capable of establishing efficient infection in these cells (Fig. S1B) . Thus, despite efficiently establishing infection and blocking NF-B activation late in infection to an equal extent, T3D induced cell death to a much greater extent in L929 cells than did T1L. These data suggest that unlike that reported for HEK293 cells (34) , differences in the capacity of T3D and T1L to evoke cell death in L929 cells are not related to inhibition of NF-B late in infection.",

            "text": "Activation of NF-B is not required for reovirus-induced cell death. Previously, we have suggested that activation of NF-B early, 6 to 8 h after reovirus infection, is required for caspase-8mediated generation of tBid and attendant activation of effector caspases (14) . To determine if NF-B activation following infection of L929 cells with T1L and T3D differs, we measured the activation of NF-B by measuring the loss of IB\u2423 inhibitor from the cytoplasm and the consequent translocation of the NF-B RelA/p65 subunit to the nucleus (21, 36) . Immunoblot analysis of IB\u2423 levels 7.5 h after infection indicates a greater decrease in IB\u2423 levels following infection with T3D than following infection with T1L ( Fig. 2A) . Consistent with these data, we found a significantly greater level of RelA in the nuclear extracts of T3D-infected cells than in those of T1L-infected cells (Fig. 2B) . To test the idea that the enhanced death-inducing potential of T3D in L929 cells may be related to an increased capacity to activate NF-B, we determined if blockade of NF-B activation would diminish cell death following T3D infection. For these experiments, we assessed the capacity of T3D to promote cell death in cells treated with an IB\u2423 kinase (IKK) inhibitor, BAY- 65-1942 (21, 37) . We found that blockade of IKK activation had no effect on the induction of cell death by T3D (Fig. 2C ). Treatment of cells with TNF-\u2423 in the presence of the IKK inhibitor resulted in cell death, demonstrating that the IKK inhibitor is functional in L929 cells and can block TNF-\u2423-induced prosurvival NF-B signaling. To ensure that the IKK inhibitor also blocked the unusual IKK complex activated by reovirus (21) , we assessed the effect of IKK inhibition on effector caspase activation following reovirus infection. Consistent with the requirement of IKK activity in promoting proapoptotic signaling following reovirus infection (21) , we found that in comparison to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated cells, effector caspase activity following reovirus infection was significantly diminished following treatment of cells with the IKK inhibitor (Fig. 2D) . Thus, despite blocking proapoptotic signaling following reovirus infection, the IKK inhibitor failed to block reovirus-induced cell death. These studies reveal that T3D is capable of activating a cell death pathway that is not dependent on target gene transcription by NF-B. Though this observation matches that from primary cardiac myocytes, it is distinct from that reported for other cell types (20, 34, 38) . The unexpected dispensability of NF-B signaling for cell death in L929 cells prompted us to focus on defining the nature of this cell death pathway.",

Our experiments using the IKK inhibitor suggested that reovirus may induce cell death even in the absence of active effector caspases.

Surprisingly, we found that T3D remained capable of inducing cell death in the presence of each of these inhibitors (Fig. 3A ). To ensure that the inhibitors were functional in L929 cells at the concentration used, we assessed their capacity to prevent effector caspase activation in T3Dinfected cells. For these experiments, caspase-3/7 activity in infected cells treated with each inhibitor was quantified 24 h after infection. We found that in comparison to mock-infected cells, there was an~10-fold increase in caspase-3/7 activity by infection with T3D in the presence of DMSO (Fig. 3B ). Inclusion of inhibitors of caspase-8 or caspase-9 or inclusion of a pan-caspase inhibitor completely blocked effector caspase activation. Thus, despite being capable of blocking the proapoptotic signaling pathway activated by reovirus, these inhibitors failed to prevent virally triggered cell death. These data indicate that reovirus T3D is capable of inducing a distinct cell death pathway in L929 cells that is independent of caspase activation.",

We found that reovirusinduced cell death was blocked by Nec-1 (Fig. 4A ). Simultaneous treatment of cells with Nec-1 and a pan-caspase inhibitor did not further diminish cell death, suggesting that a RIP1 kinasedependent form of cell death is the primary mechanism of cell death in these cells (Fig. 4A ). The effect of Nec-1 on reovirusinduced cell death was independent of its effect on the blockade of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an additional target of Nec-1 (42, 43) , since direct inhibition of IDO using 1-methyl-Ltryptophan did not prevent reovirus-induced cell death (see Fig. S2A in the supplemental material).

To determine whether ATP levels were affected in T3D-infected cells, we compared ATP levels over a time course of infection using a chemiluminescent assay. While an~35% to 40% reduction in ATP was observed at 24 h after infection with T3D,~75% and 95% of the ATP was lost in T3D-infected cells at 36 and 48 h after infection, respectively (Fig. 4B) . Moreover, the rate at which loss of ATP occurred in T3D-infected cells was diminished by treatment of cells with Nec-1 but not by treatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor. These data provide further support for the idea that T3D-infected L929 cells undergo necroptosis following reovirus infection. Necroptosis alters cellular architecture quite differently from apoptosis. In particular, necroptosis damages the integrity of the plasma membrane. To assess whether plasma membrane integrity was compromised following infection with T3D, we evaluated whether high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) was released into the medium of infected cells. This protein is not released from apoptotic cells undergoing secondary necrosis, and therefore, leakage of this chromatin-associated protein from cells is considered to be a marker for necrosis (46, 47) . We found that HMGB1 was released into the medium at 24 h following infection. A greater level of HMGB1 was detected in the medium at 36 and 48 h after infection with T3D (Fig. 4C) . Along with the capacity of EB to gain access and stain the nuclei of unfixed, reovirus-infected cells, a measurement equivalent to propidium iodide or sytox staining of necrotic cells (48) , the data presented here indicate that the L929 cell plasma membrane is leaky following infection with T3D. Based on the dispensability of caspases, the requirement for RIP1 kinase activity, the dramatic loss in cellular ATP levels, and the release of HMGB1 from infected cells, we conclude that reo-virus is capable of inducing an alternate cell death pathway, which has been described as necroptosis.",

Thus, in comparison to T3D-infected cells (Fig. 4B) , ATP loss following infection with T1L is delayed. The loss of ATP in T1L-infected cells was able to be diminished by Nec-1 but not pan-caspase inhibitor treatment, suggesting that cell death following T1L infection also occurs via necroptosis. We also used AOEB staining to determine the kinetics and mechanisms of T1L-induced cell death. We found~10% and~30% cell death in cells infected with T1L at 48 and 72 h after infection, respectively (Fig. S3B ). Because cell death following T1L infection is sensitive to Nec-1 and is substantially lower than th\u1ebd 60% cell death induced by T3D at 48 h after infection, our data indicate that T1L induces necroptosis in L929 cells with slower kinetics than T3D.",

We also found that induction of the necroptosis pathway following reovirus infection occurs later in infection and requires the de novo synthesis of viral RNA or proteins. RIP1-dependent necroptosis pathways are initiated via at least three different mechanisms. One pathway for initiation of necroptosis is dependent on death receptor signaling (50) . Experiments presented here and in several other studies indicate that death receptor signaling is activated following reovirus infection (14, 22, 51) . While this observation may suggest that necroptosis following reovirus infection may be a consequence of death receptor signaling, our findings using the IKK inhibitor, which fails to inhibit necroptosis despite blocking classical apoptotic pathways, argues against this idea. An alternate pathway for the induction of necroptosis involves recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors. Among these, TLR3, a sensor of dsRNA, and DNA-dependent activator of interferon regulatory factor (DAI), a sensor of dsDNA, have been implicated in initiating necroptosis following viral infection (52, 53) . Based on the requirement for viral genomic RNA and for viral replication, our data may suggest a role for TLR3-mediated detection of viral RNA in induction of necroptosis in these cells. If so, it remains to be determined how viral genomic RNA within the reovirus core or viral mRNA, which is present in the cytoplasm, may be detected by endosomally localized TLR3. A third pathway for necroptosis is thought to occur independently from Toll-like receptor (TLR) or death receptor signaling and requires the loss of inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) (52) . Interestingly, there is evidence for the loss of IAPs during reovirus infection (25) . Thus, it is possible that necroptosis following reovirus infection may be initiated by any of these pathways. It is also possible that one of the eleven reovirus proteins synthesized by translation of viral mRNA triggers this death response. Our ongoing studies are targeted toward understanding how necroptosis is triggered by reovirus infection and how strains T3D and T1L differ in their capacity to evoke necroptosis.",

This 2-MDa signaling complex is comprised of three core components, RIP1, caspase-8, and FADD (54) . In addition, it also contains regulators such as cFLIP, cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP. The decision between cell survival, apoptosis, and necroptosis occurs at the level of the ripoptosome and depends on the activity of caspase-8 (40) . When procaspase-8 is sufficiently processed and caspase-8 activity is high, apoptosis ensues. In contrast, when caspase-8 activity is lower due to heterodimerization of caspase-8 with cFLIP L , no apoptosis occurs. Under these conditions, caspase-8-cFLIP L complexes retain sufficient activity to cleave RIP1, preventing necroptosis. Thus, when Results are expressed as the mean ratios of caspase-3/7 activity from infected cell lysates to that from equivalently treated mock-infected cells for triplicate samples. We note that the DMSO-treated cells are the same as those used in Fig. 2 . Error bars indicate SD. *, P value of \u03fd0.05 as determined by Student's t test in comparison to T3Dinfected cells treated with DMSO. activity of caspase-8 is low, cells survive. If, instead, caspase-8 is blocked by binding to cFLIP L or the presence of cIAPs, RIP1 is not cleaved and the cells undergo necroptosis. Thus, we should anticipate that when caspase-8 is active, reovirus infection results in apoptosis, and when it is inhibited, by inclusion of caspase-8 or pan-caspase inhibitor, reovirus infection produces necroptosis. In our studies, reovirus-induced cell death was sensitive to Nec-1 even in the absence of treatment with caspase inhibitors. These data suggest that the activity of caspase-8 following reovirus infection is not sufficient to cleave and inactivate RIP1, thereby allowing induction of necroptosis.",

One possible reason for why this observation has not been previously reported is that prior studies on reovirus apoptosis, including our own, have not examined this possibility. In the majority of studies, cell death following reovirus infection has been considered apoptotic due to the presence of morphological and biochemical features, but the effect of treatments that block cell death has been evaluated in some (8, 14, 32, 58) but not all (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) 51) cell types. Alternatively, it is possible that this pathway has been discovered in L929 cells due to peculiarities in the amounts or activities of proteins that regulate various forms of cell death. Because L929 cells are among the most permissive to reovirus infection, a related possibility is that reovirus alters the levels of these signaling or regulatory molecules differently or to a different extent than in other cell types. Regardless, our data indicate that necroptosis following reovirus infection is an alternate mechanism of cell death.",

            "text": "Analogous to studies on reovirus-induced apoptosis (14, 20, 21) , we found no effect of inhibition of necroptosis on reovirus replication (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Thus, regardless of whether reovirus induces necroptosis in other cultured cell lines, the physiological relevance of necroptosis to reovirus infection can be determined only by in vivo experiments, as has been necessary for the demonstration of the pathogenic role of reovirus-induced apoptosis (7-12, 14-16, 59) . T3 reoviruses cause bile duct injury, leading to biliary atresia (60) (61) (62) (63) . Histological examination of the reovirus-infected bile ducts has revealed the presence of necrotic tissue (61, 62) . Some studies on reovirusinduced myocarditis also report the presence of necrotic lesions (12, 13, 64) . Consistent with the induction of the necrotic form of cell death, inflammatory cells are detected in the injured tissues (12, 13, 61, 62) . In each of these cases, it is not clear if the necrotic tissue observed is secondary necrosis as a consequence of apoptosis or whether direct induction of necrosis contributes to cell death in these tissues. In at least two of these studies (12, 13) , cell death in the infected tissue appears to occur even in the absence of molecules previously shown to be required for apoptosis in cultured cells (20, 26) , suggesting the existence of alternate mechanisms of cell death. Further work is needed to determine whether this alternate form of cell death is indeed necrotic and occurs via a caspase-independent, RIP1-dependent pathway that we have identified here. Such studies will enhance our understanding of reovirus pathogenesis. The two forms of programmed cell death pathways observed following reovirus infection, apoptosis and necroptosis, are part of the intrinsic host defense response (1, 2) . Analogous to a few other viruses (65) (66) (67) (68) (69) (70) (71) (72) (73) , apoptosis following reovirus infection is activated prior to synthesis of the viral RNA by the proteinaceous components of the incoming viral capsid (15, 16, 19, 49) . Though there are fewer studies that indicate how necroptosis is initiated following virus infection, extant information and our findings presented here indicate that necroptosis is initiated later in infection following synthesis of new viral genomes or gene products (53, (74) (75) (76) . Based on these findings, we propose that apoptosis and necroptosis are two complementary mechanisms that sense and respond to different stages of pathogen invasion with a common goal of limiting viral infection through cellular suicide.",

Spinner-adapted L929 cells (obtained from T. Dermody's laboratory) were maintained in Joklik's MEM (Lonza) supplemented to contain 5% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 g/ml of streptomycin, and 25 ng/ml of amphotericin B. Spinner-adapted L929 cells were used for cultivating and purifying viruses and for plaque assays. ATCC L929 cells were used for all experiments to assess cell death and cell signaling. No differences were observed in permissivity between ATCC L929 cells and spinner-adapted L929 cells. Prototype reovirus strains T1L and T3D were regenerated by plasmid-based reverse genetics (77, 78) . No reverse genetic system is available for T3A, and thus, a laboratory stock was used. Infectious and genome-deficient viral particles were purified by Vertrel XF extraction and CsCl gradient centrifugation (79) . Viral titer was determined by a plaque assay using spinner-adapted L929 cells (80) . UVinactivated virus was generated using a UV cross-linker (CL-1000 UV Crosslinker; UVP). T3D virus (1 \u03eb 10 9 PFU/ml) was irradiated with short-wave (254-nm) UV on ice at a distance of 10 cm for 1 min at 120,000 J/cm 2 in a 60-mm tissue culture dish. Particle numbers for top-component and infectious virus were determined by estimating the protein concentration in each sample. One hundred eighty-five micrograms of protein was considered equal to 2.1 \u03eb 10 12 virions (81). Relative per-particle infectivity of intact, genome-deficient virions and UVinactivated virions was determined using indirect immunofluorescence.",
