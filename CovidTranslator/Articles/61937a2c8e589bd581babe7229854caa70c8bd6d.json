In this study, independent lines of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from two patients with molecularly confirmed mutations in CLN3, the gene mutated in JNCL. Clinical-grade adeno-associated adenovirus serotype 2 (AAV2) carrying the full-length coding sequence of human CLN3 was generated in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-registered cGMP facility. AAV2-CLN3 was efficacious in restoring full-length CLN3 transcript and protein in patient-specific fibroblasts and iPSC-derived retinal neurons. When injected into the subretinal space of wild-type mice, purified AAV2-CLN3 did not show any evidence of retinal toxicity.

            "text": "CLN3-associated JNCL presents with rapidly progressive retinal degeneration that typically manifests between 4 and 7 years of age. Ophthalmoscopic findings include bull's eye maculopathy, optic nerve pallor, attenuated arterioles and peripheral retinal granularity. Within 2-5 years of diagnosis, patients usually experience profound vision loss that is due primarily to death of the light-sensing photoreceptor cells of the outer neural retina. In the ensuing decade, extensive death of CNS neurons leads to the onset of seizures, difficulty communicating, problems in walking, and ultimately death during the second or third decade of life. No U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments currently exist for this fatal disease, but the fact that JNCL is a recessive disease, caused by variations in a gene expressed in the retina, raises the possibility of (1) lessening the risk of recurrence of the disease in affected families through a combination of genetic counseling and preimplantation genetic testing, and (2) preventing neural cell death and disease progression via gene addition.",

Dezii Translational Vision Research Facility (DTVRF) within the Stephen A. Wynn Institute for Vision Research at the University of Iowa. This facility contains an independent high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered equipment room, an ISO (International Organization for Standardization) class 7 (class 10,000) material storage and handling room, two ISO class 7 (class 10,000) gowning areas, two ISO class 6 (class 1000) processing rooms, and an unclassified service chase with dedicated access for equipment and facility maintenance. Each of the two processing rooms is equipped with custom BioSpherix Xvivo closed incubation systems, which are designed to exceed ISO class 5 (class 100) cleanliness requirements to ensure minimal biological contamination throughout standard operating procedures, while providing absolute optimal conditions for the long-term culturing of cells under defined atmospheric conditions. AAV2-CLN3 was manufactured using a characterized human HEK293T master cell line. To package the CLN3 vector in AAV2 particles, HEK293T cells were transfected with a set of constructs encoding (1) normal human CLN3 (pAAV2-CMV-CLN3, which contains the expression cassette flanked by AAV2 ITRs) and (2) AAV (pXX2-R2C2, AAV2 packaging plasmid containing AAV2 rep and cap sequences) and helper virus-derived sequences (pHelper, containing E2A and E4 genes from adenovirus serotype 2), which are required for packaging. Each of these plasmids was sequence confirmed via bidirectional sequencing before packaging in the DTVRF. HEK293T cells taken from a qualified Master Cell Bank (DTVRF HEK293T) were plated and expanded in T600 multilayer tissue culture flasks (production batch scale of 20 flasks). On reaching confluence, cells were simultaneously transfected with pAAV2-CMV-CLN3, pXX2-R2C2, and pHelper. To purify AAV2-CLN3, the following steps were performed: (1) HEK293T cultures were passaged and centrifuged to remove cell culture reagents and low molecular weight impurities; (2) HEK293T cells were lysed to release the intracellular vector, and nuclease digestion was performed to remove nucleic acid impurities; (3) cell debris was removed from the lysate via filtration, using 0.45-and 0.2-lm filters; (4) density gradient ultracentrifugation was performed to separate empty capsids (a major impurity) from the vector product; (5) affinity chromatography was performed using an \u00c4 KTA Pure 25 chromatography system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) to purify vector; (6) viral particles were subsequently concentrated via buffer exchange; and (7) working concentrations of AAV2-CLN3 were formulated in injection buffer (180 mM NaCl plus 10 mM Na 3 PO 4 [trisodium phosphate] in water for injection at pH 7.2), filtered through a 0.2-lm filter, and vialed and labeled.",

The imr90 (WiCell Research Institute, Madison, WI) human iPSC line was used as a nondisease control. Fibroblasts were isolated, cultured, and reprogrammed as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) via viral transduction of the transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC as previously described. 16, 17, 19, 23 Approximately 3 weeks after transduction, densely packed colonies of cells with a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio (Fig. 1A-C) were isolated and clonally expanded. After 10 passages expression of the pluripotency transcripts c-MYC, KLF4, NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 was confirmed via rt-PCR ( Fig. 1A-C) . Pluripotency was further assessed with the newly available TaqMan human pluripotent stem cell Scorecard panel. 24, 25 This assay uses real-time PCR to compare transcript expression levels required for self-renewal, ectoderm, mesoderm, or endoderm formation in lines of interest to an undifferentiated iPSC reference gene set. Pair-wise comparison of all C t values for genes tested showed that imr90, B775, and B967 were pluripotent and transcriptionally similar to one another as demonstrated by scatter plots and correlation coefficients (Fig. 1D-F; imr90 vs. B775 = 0.7847, p < 0.0001; imr90 vs. B967 = 0.6493, p < 0.0001; B775 vs. B967 = 0.7048, p < 0.0001).

For these experiments, we used a two-dimensional differentiation protocol that we have previously demonstrated for the development of patient-specific retinal cells (Fig. 2C,  inset) . 16, 17 The AAV we chose for these studies was the serotype 2 AAV vector designed with a CMV promoter driving CLN3 gene expression ( Fig. 2A) . This AAV vector is the same serotype that has been successfully used in clinical human gene augmentation trials to treat RPE65-associated Leber congenital amaurosis. 8, 11, 50 Initially, to test the ability of this vector to drive CLN3 transcript, we transduced CLN3 patient fibroblasts and performed rt-PCR using primers specific to human CLN3. Little (B775) or no (B967) CLN3 transcript was detected in fibroblasts derived from either patient with JNCL before transduction (Fig. 2B ). AAV2-CLN3 was able to drive and restore robust expression of CLN3 transcript in the cells of both patients (Fig. 2B) . To test the efficacy of AAV2-CLN3 in restoring full-length CLN3 protein in patientspecific retinal neurons, we differentiated patient iPSCs for 30 days, the time point at which neuronal rosettes are clearly visible in differentiating cultures (Fig. 2C, inset) . To assess CLN3 protein levels we produced an immunoblot, using a human anti-CLN3 antibody. CLN3 was robustly expressed in whole retinal protein lysate isolated from a human donor eye, as expected (Fig. 2C, H. Ret) . Neurons from an unaffected control patient, imr90, at 30 days postdifferentiation expressed CLN3, whereas undifferentiated iPSCs did not (Fig. 2C , imr90 iPSCs vs. imr90 D30). AAV2-CLN3 restored full-length CLN3 protein to retinal neurons derived from both CLN3 patients, B775 and B967, compared with uninfected differentiated neurons (Fig. 2C) . These data demonstrate that we successfully cloned and packaged an AAV vector driving CLN3 and that this vector is efficacious in restoring full-length CLN3 transcript and protein to patient-specific neural progenitor cells.",

To achieve this, we produced AAV2-CLN3 under cGMP conditions in an onsite, FDA-registered cGMP facility. This facility exceeds ISO class 5 (class 100) cleanliness requirements to ensure minimal biological contamination throughout standard operating procedures, while providing optimal conditions for the long-term culturing of cells under defined atmospheric conditions. AAV2-CLN3 was manufactured with a characterized human HEK293T master cell line. HEK293T cells were transfected with a transgene cassette plasmid AAV2-CMV-CLN3, an AAV2 packaging plasmid containing AAV2 rep and cap sequences, and a plasmid carrying helper virusderived sequences (pHelper, containing E2A and E4 genes from adenovirus serotype 2). To purify AAV2-CLN3, HEK293T cultures were passaged and centrifuged to remove cell culture reagents and low molecular weight impurities and lysed and digested to release the intracellular vector and remove nucleic acid impurities. Cellular debris was removed from the lysate via filtration followed by density gradient ultracentrifugation to separate empty capsids (a major impurity) from the vector product. Finally, affinity chromatography was performed to purify the vector and AAV2-CLN3 was subsequently concentrated via buffer exchange. To demonstrate the purity of AAV2-CLN3, we performed a series of rt-PCRs to assess the presence of viruses and vector contaminants. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 , AAV2-CLN3 was completely devoid of viral DNA of human (Fig. 3A) , simian (Fig. 3B) , bovine (Fig. 3D) , and porcine origin (Fig. 3E) . AAV2-CLN3 also lacked expression of all viruses specified by the code of federal regulations (Fig. 3C) .",

At 3 weeks postinjection rt-PCR, using primers specific for human CLN3, showed robust expression of CLN3 transcript in AAV2-CLN3-injected retinas as compared with vehicle-injected controls (Fig. 3F) . With a highly pure and concentrated AAV2-CLN3 vector in hand, we next asked whether delivery of CLN3, at a viral titer exceeding that which would likely be tested in humans, would be toxic when injected into wildtype murine retinas. We injected wild-type C57BL/ 6J mice with either 10 9 VG of AAV2-GFP (n = 10 right eyes) or 10 9 VG of AAV2-CLN3 (n = 10 left eyes) and assessed retinal histology 2 months postinjection. Uninjected wild-type eyes were used as an additional control to ensure there was no green fluorescent protein (GFP)-induced retinal toxicity (Fig. 3G ). Vector-induced toxicity was assessed by measuring and comparing the mean thickness of the outer nuclear layer between treatment groups. Mean outer nuclear layer thickness did not differ between AAV2-GFP-and AAV2-CLN3-injected eyes ( Fig. 3J ; p = 0.72). Likewise, hematoxylin-and eosinstained sections were morphologically identical between uninjected (Fig. 3G) , AAV2-GFP-injected (Fig. 3H) , and AAV2-CLN3-injected eyes (Fig. 3I) .

Similarities between the neural retina and the cerebral cortex suggest that success of a gene augmentation-based approach in the eye could serve as proof-of-principle for a similar treatment in the brain. In vivo animal studies assessing both the efficacy and safety of AAVmediated gene delivery to the brain have been demonstrated for two forms of NCL: infantile NCL (caused by mutations in the gene PPT1) and late infantile NCL (caused by mutations in the gene TPP1). AAV delivery of TPP1 to the brain has been demonstrated in mice, 57-59 rats, 60 nonhuman primates, 60 and canines. 61 Likewise, one group has demonstrated the efficacy of AAV-mediated delivery of PPT1 in murine eyes 62 before showing that CNS delivery ameliorated functional deficits in the same Ppt1 -/mouse. 63 Importantly, AAV2-mediated treatment of 10 children with TPP1-associated late infantile NCL, administered throughout the CNS, slowed disease progression. 64 These studies have laid the groundwork for similar treatment of children with CLN3 disease.",

Although observing efficacy in the eyes of these children would be a great achievement, and would significantly reduce the suffering from this disease, blindness is only one of the problems faced by patients with JNCLs. Development of a treatment that could be used to slow or prevent the cognitive decline, onset of seizures, and loss of motor function associated with JNCL is the ultimate goal. Unlike the genes TPP1 and PPT1, both of which transcribe soluble enzymes, 58,63,65-67 CLN3 encodes an intracellular protein that is localized to the membrane of lysosomes. Unfortunately, this means that compared with TPP1-or PPT1-associated NCL, which can be effectively treated by transducing a relatively small number of cells and relying on the secreted gene product to induce a widespread rescue effect, for CLN3 gene augmentation to be effective it is likely that extensive CNS transduction will be necessary. Although AAV2based transduction of cone photoreceptor cells and inner retinal neurons may be sufficient to prevent vision loss, it is likely that a serotype such as AAV9, which has been demonstrated to be significantly better at transducing CNS neurons, 68,69 will be required. Even then, to treat the entire CNS, one would need to deliver a large quantity of viral vector by some means, perhaps by repeated intrathecal injection. Whether a patient could tolerate such treatments, and whether they could ameliorate the condition sufficiently to make it worthwhile, are completely unknown at the present time.",

They decrease the patient's ability to respond to infections, 72 increase the chance of developing cancer, 73 and can cause injury to vital organs. 74 Although animal models of disease are valuable for testing therapeutic efficacy, large-scale screening for compounds that may be capable of altering disease progression will require in vitro models such as patient-specific iPSCs that recapitulate key disease phenotypes such as autofluorescent lysosomal storage granules.",

For these patients, transplantation of iPSCderived photoreceptor precursors may eventually be able to restore some of their vision. For autologous cell replacement therapy, one would first need to correct the CLN3 mutations to prevent the newly transplanted cells from suffering the same fate as the original ones. This is particularly important for JNCL because of its early onset and aggressive photoreceptor death. Fortunately, advances in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing now allow the highly specific correction of disease-causing alleles in patientspecific stem cells. As CLN3-associated JNCL is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, correction of either of a patient's disease-causing alleles should be sufficient. It is advantageous that the most common mutation in CLN3, a 1-kb genomic deletion, occurs in approximately 85% of patients. 4 For example, the two patients investigated in this study each harbor this mutation: one heterozygously and the other homozygously.

Furthermore, AAV2-CLN3 is safe in the eyes of wild-type mice, displaying a complete lack of vector-induced overexpression toxicity. This study provides preclinical data for the use of AAV2-CLN3 to treat retinal degenerative blindness caused by mutations in the gene CLN3.",
