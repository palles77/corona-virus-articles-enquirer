Additionally, these names reflect the homology of family members to certain toxins. The structural characterization of the catalytic domains of the ARTs diphtheria toxin and clostridial C2 and C3 toxins revealed that these have distinct folds. The fold in diphtheria toxin is related to the intracellular ARTs and the fold in the clostridial toxins is related to the extra cellular ARTs, hence the extension D and C, respectively, to the ART family name 5 . For ARTD enzymes, it is not entirely clear which amino acid serves as the ADP-ribose acceptor. Some studies indicate that Lys residues are the main acceptor 9-11 , whereas others have identified modified Glu and Asp residues [12] [13] [14] . Thus, the amino acid specificity of distinct ARTD enzymes is currentl y an open question.",

Poly(ADPribosyl) ation (PARylation) has been shown to influence different signalling processes, and distinct protein modules are known to bind this modification 7, 15, 16 . One such module is the macrodomain, which was originally identified in the core histone variant macroH2A 17 . Four years ago, macrodomains were shown to be able to bind PAR that has been synthesized in response to DNA damage 20, 25, 26 . More recently, the macrodomain of PAR glycohydrolase (PARG) was identified as a PAR hydrolase [21] [22] [23] , demonstrating that distinct macrodomains can both read and process PAR in addition to their ability to interact with ADP-ribose. We use the term 'reader' throughout this article to indicate proteins that recognize, but do not process, substrates that are modified with ADPribose.

However, several reports now indicate that MARylation also has a role in different intracellular signalling processes. Moreover, certain macrodomains have now been identified as binding modules for this PTM and, in addition, other macrodomaincontaining proteins have been reported to remove MAR from substrate proteins. These novel findings, which are reviewed in this Opinion article, suggest that MARylation is a PTM that can be read and erased by macrodomai n-containing proteins. In light of these observations, we propose that MARylation is a reversible PTM that serves to control protein-protei n interactions or enzymatic activity, and that macrodomains are key modules that regulate MARylation. Moreover, it seems probable that additional m acrodomain-containing proteins that affect MARylation will be identified and that additional readers and erasers of MARylation that possess different structures also exist.",

These PAR chains then serve as a docking site for several proteins involved in DNA damag e repair and the associated chromatin remodelling factors, including APLF, ALC1, CHFR and macroH2A1.1 (25) (26) (27) .

For example, auto-PARylation of ARTD1 results in its release from DNA 28 , and PARylation of TRF1 (telomeric repeat-binding factor 1) by ARTD5 inhibits the ability of TRF1 to bind to telomeric DNA 29 . Interestingly, in many other cases, PAR chains serve as scaffolding modules that attract interacting proteins through specific binding domains. For example, the E3-ubiquitin ligase RING finge r 146 (RNF146) binds to the PAR chains generated on axin by ARTD5 through its WWE (that is, Trp-Trp-Glu) domain 30 , and subsequently ubiquitylates axin. Thus, axin PARylation indirectly promotes its proteasomal degradation 31, 32 . As axin is an inhibitory component of the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex in the WNT signalling pathway 33 , the ART activity of ARTD5 stimulates this signal transductio n pathway.",

Macrodomains are evolutionarily conserved structural modules of 130-190 amino acids that are found in proteins in many different organisms, and they are associated with several distinct activities (BOX 1) . With respect to PAR, ALC1 is recruited to sites of DNA damag e through its macrodomain, and this is dependent on the activation of PARforming ARTDs 7, 15 . Moreover, a recent study revealed that the catalytic domain of PARG, the major enzyme responsible for the catabolism of PAR, possesses a macrodomain fold [21] [22] [23] 37 . These findings demonstrate that macrodomains are intimately involved in PAR metabolism. With regards to the catabolism of PAR, it is worth noting that a second enzyme, ADP-ribosylhydrolase 3 (ARH3), can remove PARylation 38 . The structure of the catalytic domain of this protein has a distinct fold without obvious homology to macro domains 39 . PARG, and most likely also ARH3, seem to be unable to remove the protein proximal ADP-ribose unit, even though some earlier reports suggested it could. Considering that the bonds between two ADP-ribose units and between ADPribose and a protein are different, it is not too surprising that different enzymes are required for these cleavage events. Thus, the activity of PARG on a PARylated substrate results in a MARylated product 21, 40 . In contrast to PARylation, less is known about the functional relevance of MARylation, as well as the structures that read it and the enzymes that reverse this modification. The most recent findings, however, strongly indicate that macrodomains also control the functions of this PTM, that is, that macro domains function as readers and erasers of MARylation.",

ARTD10 was initially identified as an interaction partner of the transcription factor and proto-oncoprotein MYC 42 , and it was the first ARTD to be characterized as a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase 8 . The nuclear interaction of ARTD10 with MYC was verified, although most ARTD10 seems to be present in highly dynamic cytoplasmic foci that are rich in ubiquitin 43 . ARTD10 is the only ARTD family member that possesses recognizable ubiquitin-interaction motifs. These bind to Lys63-linked polyubiquitin, which seems to be important for the abilit y of ARTD10 to repress nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signalling 44 . Within the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway, ARTD10 MARylates NEMO (NF-\u03baB essential modulator), which results in reduced NEMO polyubiquitylation and thus decreased NF-\u03baB signalling (FIG. 1a) . It is postulated that the Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains serve as scaffolds to bring ARTD10 into close proximity to NEMO, which also interacts with the ubiquitin chains 45 . Moreover, overexpression of ARTD10 leads to apoptosis in HeLa cells dependent on its catalytic activity, and ARTD10 knockdown increases cell survival upon DNA damage caused by doxorubicin 46 . Because NF-\u03baB signalling promotes cell survival, it is possible that ARTD10 affects apoptosis through repressing this signalling pathway. However, other explanations are also possible. Additional substrates of ARTD10 were identified in protein microarrays, includin g several kinases 47 . Glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) was investigated to verify the screen and to address the consequences of MARylation. It was found that GSK3\u03b2 displays reduced kinase activity when it is modified by MAR. Overexpression of ARTD10 decreased GSK3\u03b2 activity, whereas knockdown of endogenous ARTD10 enhanced GSK3\u03b2 activity, which suggests that GSK3\u03b2 MARylation occurs in cells 47 . MARylation of GSK3\u03b2 could thus modulate the function of this kinase in downstream signalling pathways, such as WNT signalling, in which GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylates \u03b2-catenin to lead to \u03b2-catenin proteasomal degradation 48 . Together, these findings indicate that ARTD10-mediate d MARylation is involved in multiple signalling processes.",

ARTD8 potentiates STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6)-mediated transcription and, in accordance with this, it was named co-activator of STAT6 (CoaSt6) in earlier studies. In these studie s, ARTD8 was shown to ADP-ribosylate p100 (FIG. 1b) , but it was not determined whether p100 was MARylated or PARylated. p100 functions as a STAT6 cofactor, bridging this trans cription facto r to the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) complex 52 . A catalytically inactive ARTD8 mutant could not potentiate STAT6 activit y, which indicates that catalytic activity is essential. However, whether p100 is the relevant substrate of ARTD8 remains to be determined. Additionally, ARTD8 binds to the transcriptional repressors histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and HDAC3 in unstimulated cells and ADP-ribosylates these deacetylases upon interleukin-4 (IL-4) stimulation.

The macrodomain, which is a globular module, was identified as a domain of the histone variant macroH2A, and at the time it was of unknown function 17 . Macrodomains are not only found in vertebrates but also in many bacteria, archaea, viruses and plants, suggesting their evolutionary conservation [59] [60] [61] . Their structural characteristics are described in more The ADP-ribosyltransferase ARTD10 mono-(ADP-ribosyl)ates (MARylates) NEMO and reduces its polyubiquitylation, which is dependent on both the ARTD10 ubiquitin-interaction motifs (UIMs) and its catalytic activity. This prevents NEMO from triggering the degradation of inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB), which sequesters NF-\u03baB in the cytoplasm to decrease its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. b | ARTD8 functions as an activator of STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6), in a manner dependent on its catalytic activity and its macrodomains. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) stimulates the catalytic activity of ARTD8, leading to the MARylation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and HDAC3 and their subsequent dissociation from the IL-4-responsive promoter. This allows STAT6 and the transcriptional cofactors p100 and p300 to bind to the promoter. p100 is also MARylated by ARTD8, and this might help bridge STAT6 to the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) complex. One function of p300 is to modify core histones to promote transcription, potentially cooperating with the activity of p100. c | ARTD14 interacts with aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) (which forms a complex with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)), and represses AHR-mediated transcription dependent on its catalytic domain and zinc-finger domain. Although ARTD14 was shown to MARylate core histones, it is not clear whether histones are the substrates relevant for the repressive effect of ARTD14 on AHR or whether other target proteins play a part. d | ARTD15 is located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it MARylates the cytosolic part of the ER stress sensors PERK (protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase) and IRE1\u03b1 (inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase and endonuclease 1\u03b1), leading to an increase in their activity. In the ER lumen the carboxyl terminus of ARTD15 is indispensable for PERK and IRE1\u03b1 activation, potentially because it stimulates the dissociation of the inhibitory factor BiP (binding immunoglobulin protein) from them. ARTD15 thus stimulates the unfolded protein response (UPR). A third ER stress sensor, ATF6, is not modified by ARTD15. TMD, transmembrane domain. detail in BOX 1. Later, it became clear that macrodomains can interact with PARylated proteins and serve as binding modules for free ADP-ribose, as demonstrated first for the macrodomain of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus protein Af1521 and the macrodomains of ARTD9 (REF. 62 ). Moreover, a catalytic activity has been assigned to some macrodomain-containing proteins, namely hydrolysis of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose 63,64 , which is a metabolite from the sirtuin-mediated NAD + -dependent deacetylation reaction 65 . Additionally, some macrodomains posses s phosphatase activity towards ADPribose-1\u0374\u0374-phosphate, which is a product of tRNA splicing 60, 66 . This phosphatase activity is widespread and found in m acrodomaincontaining proteins in viruses, bacteri a and eukaryotes 62,66-69 . However, the observed reaction velocity is ranked as low throughout these studies 67, 68 , raising the question of how physiologically relevant this activit y is 67 . In accordance, this macrodomain phosphatas e activity does not seem to be essential for the replication of human coronavirus in tissue culture 70 . Thus, the relevance of this activity remains to be investigated. Currently, the roles of macrodomain-containing proteins have been studie d most extensively for PARylation. In this case, relevant information was retrieved from the publication first defining this in PARG 21 and from REFS 16, 96. The information on the right refers to the functionalities of the macrodomains only. 'Yes' indicates that the respective activity has been shown for this macrodomain-containing protein, and 'No' indicates that this activity has been excluded experimentally. Dashes indicate that these activities have not yet been investigated. Numbers correspond to the amino acids in human proteins. Please note that for some of these proteins, multiple splice variants are known, but for simplicity only one has been depicted, with the exception of macroH2A1, for which splicing influences its PAR-binding capacity. \u2021 Initial evidence has suggested that C6orf130 can also release complete PAR chains by cleaving the bond between Glu and the first ADP-ribose 13 .

ARTD9 was identified as a risk factor in diffuse large B cell lymphoma 72 as it is over expressed in this disease, and it was shown to interact with the E3 ligase BBAP (B lymphom a-and BAL-associated protein; also known as DTX3L) 73 , although the exact function of the ARTD9-BBAP interactio n remained undefined. However, it was recently suggested that ARTD9, which possesses two macrodomains, is recruited to ARTD1-generated PAR at DNA damage sites via its macro domain 2, and that this is followed by BBAP-dependent local ubiquitylation and the subsequent recruitment of BRCA1 (breast cancer 1) and 53BP1 (p53-binding protei n 1) 74 . ARTD9 does not seem to have any catalytic activity 75 . As the macrodomain 2, but not the macrodomain 1, can localize ARTD9 to PAR chains 62, 74 , the function of macro domain 1 is unclear. Additionally, the recruitment of both macro D1 and m acroD2 to PAR synthe sized by ARTD1 at damaged sites was observed in cells, but the consequences of this remain to be investigated 26 . This finding contradicts an earlier report that suggested that only m acroD1 can efficiently bind PAR 66 ",

It was postulated that the identified proteins are MARylated, although it was unclear whether this was indeed the case in these experiments. Moreover, because the macro domain used was of bacterial origin and also capable of binding PARylated proteins 62 , the question remained whether endogenous human macrodomain-containing proteins exist that can bind to MARylated proteins in cells. Certain macrodomains interact with poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), including the macrodomains of DNA repair factors (Ba). Other macrodomains, for example macrodomain 3 of ARTD8, recognize ARTD10-mediated MARylation (Bb). We propose that this will serve either to recruit other proteins or to induce further signalling through intrinsic domains, such as the ART domain in ARTD8. C | Macrodomains as erasers of ADP-ribosylation. Glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) is MARylated by ARTD10, leading to a decrease in its kinase activity. MacroD2 removes the MARylation, which reverts the inhibitory effect and increases GSK3\u03b2 kinase activity (Ca). In addition to removal of MARylation, C6orf130 may also release entire PAR chains from PARylated proteins. This activity needs to be characterized in more detail (Cb). Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) degrades PAR chains on ARTD1 but leaves the last ADP-ribose attached to the protein (Cc). This MAR moiety then potentially serves as a scaffold to recruit MAR readers to initiate further responses. Alternatively, ARTD1 MARylation serves as a substrate of MAR hydrolase s, including macroD2, which revert the protein into its native state. Relevant proteins are depicted or examples are given if the activity demonstrated is shared by several macrodomains. Of note, these activities are not mutually exclusive as several macrodomain s exhibit more than one function (summarized in TABLE 2) .",

These interactions are specific as neither macrodomain 2 nor macro domain 3 of ARTD8 interacts with PARylated substrates. By contrast, macro domain 1 of ARTD8 does not interact with MARylated or PARylated proteins 79 . Furthermore, the macro domains of ARTD8 precipitated the ARTD10 substrate NEMO from cells co-expressing ARTD10 (REF. 44 ), indicating that these macro domains can be used as tools to confirm MARylation that is mediated by the ARTD family in cells. The ability of macrodomains to recognize MAR attached to proteins is not a general feature of m acrodomains, unlike the inter action of macro domains with free ADP-ribose. Instead, the binding capacity seems to be restricted to specific macrodomains as the macrodomain of macroH2A1.1 is unable to bind MARylated ARTD10 (REF. 79 ).",

Moreover, the backbone sequence around the MARylation site may determine the substrate specificity of macrodomains, with macrodomains perhaps even recognizing a sequence or structure that is similar to the modifying ARTD enzyme.

In all three studies, ARTD10-mediated MARylation could be reversed in vitro by these three enzymes dependen t on their macrodomains. Moreover, ARTD10 MARylated histones and GSK3\u03b2 were also substrates of macroD2, and the removal of MAR from GSK3\u03b2 was sufficient to reactivate its kinase activity (FIG. 2Ca) . It is noteworthy that C6orf130 may also be capable of releasing complete PAR chains from PARylated proteins 13 (FIG. 2Cb) . It has been suggested that free PAR chains serve as signalling molecules, leading to cell death 83 . These hydrolases seem to be functionally relevant as overexpression of macroD2 in cells increases GSK3\u03b2 activit y 40 , probably by removing the MAR that has been attached to it by ARTD10 (REF. 47) (FIG. 2Ca) . Moreover, PARylated ARTD1, when incubated with PARG, can be further de-ADP-ribosylated by macroD2, supporting the notion that PARG generates MARylated ARTD1 (REFS 13, 40, 76) (FIG. 2Cc) . Conversely, the MAR-binding macro domain 2 of ARTD8 does not display hydrolytic activity towards MARylated ARTD10 or its substrates 40 . These different functionalities imply that, despite their structural similarities, key residues are present in different macrodomains that mediate these activities. The biochemical studies suggest that macroD1 and macro D2 hydrolyse ADP-ribosylated Glu residues with ADP-ribose being linked to the \u03b3-carboxylate of Glu through C1\u0374\u0374 of the distal ribose, requiring an H 2 O for the nucleophile attack 40, 76 . These findings support the dissociative S N 1-type mechanism of substrate-assisted catalysis proposed for ARTD10 (REF. 8 ), a process in which the negatively charged \u03b3-carboxylate of Glu participtates first in the destabilization of the glycosidic bond between nicotinamide and the ribose, followed by the release of nictonamide and the nucleophilic attack of the \u03b3-carboxylate on the ribose, that is, on the oxocarbenium ion generated at C1\u0374\u0374 during the transition state. Interestingly, the role of Glu residues as substrates for ADP-ribosylation is documented by a case study of a patient suffering from a lysosomal storage disease. It was found that glutamyl ribose 5-phosphate accumulated in the lysosomes of this patient 84, 85 , arguing for the relevance of enzymes that remove",

Moreover, the findings that mutations in the gene encoding C6orf130 and the accumulation of glutamyl ribose 5-phosphate are associated with neurodegeneration highlights the importance of controlling MARylation 13, 84, 85 . Nevertheless, more research is needed to dissect the precise function of MAR hydrolases. For instance, it should be addressed whether these enzymes are specific for distinct substrates by recognizing the peptide backbone underlying the MARylation site, or whether they generally remove MARylation and are regulated, for example, in a spatio-temporal manner.",

The thus far uncovered processes involving MARylation imply that this modification has a role in diverse signalling networks, including the UPR and, through its ability to influence NF-\u03baB signalling, inflammatory processes. However, this is probably only the 'tip of the iceberg' , and more work is needed to dissect the consequences of MARylation for target proteins and their associated pathways, as well as to further characterize the enzymes responsible for adding and removing this modificatio n. The identification of macrodomains as binding modules suggests that there are mechanisms that can sense MARylation and likely respond to it through the associated proteins. Furthermore, these reports provide the first proof that endogenous intra cellular MARylation actually exists. The characterization of macrodomain-containin g proteins as hydrolases of MARylated proteins indicates that this modification is reversible, like other PTMs, and can thus form a transient signal in response to distinct stimuli (FIG. 2) . To fully apprehend the function of MARylation, better tools and reliable method s must be developed (for example, antibodies) to be able to measure MARylation in cells and to map modificatio n sites within target proteins.",

            "text": "Macrodomain-containing proteins also require further investigation. Currently, there is only a limited number of proteins with identified macrodomains. Because the macrodomain fold in PARG could not be deduced from sequence alignments alone, more macrodomain-containing proteins might be discovered purely based on their structure. The known macro domaincontaining proteins (TABLE 2) should be studied in more detail to determine whether they bind poly(ADP-ribose) or mono(ADPribose) and what activity they have. Moreover, it is not entirely clear why some macrodomains only bind PAR chains and others only MAR, or why some have catalytic activities whereas others do not (apart from PARG in which the catalytic loop enables PARG to breakdown PAR chains). The crucial residues for these different functions need to be investigated in more detail. Future research should thus be directed at improved understanding of the binding and catalytic mechanisms of macrodomains, to be able to determine their roles in the regulation of MARylation. One study indicates that ARTD10 and ARTD8 together modify roughly 200 proteins in vitro 47 . This is probably an underestimation, as the screen did not sample all proteins, but not all the in vitro targets may be true substrates in cells. Despite this uncertainty, assuming that each of the nine proposed mono-ADPribosyl transferases possesses 100 substrates and considering that the removal of PAR from substrates by PARG and ARH3 potentially results in MARylated substrates, it is possible that more than 1000 MARylated proteins exist. Thus, it is likely that in addition to macrodomains further domains exist that read and erase MARylation. It will be interesting to follow how this research area will develop, which substrates and pathways are sensitive to MARylation and how this PTM is interpreted and regulate d in cells.",
