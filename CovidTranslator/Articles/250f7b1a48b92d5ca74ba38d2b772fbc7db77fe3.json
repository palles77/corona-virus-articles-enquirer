            "text": "The clinical spectrum of overt SLE virus infection ranges from a mild influenza-like syndrome to life-threatening, acute central nervous system (CNS) disease (Brinker and Monath, 1980) . Deaths during this early clinical course are caused by direct damage to the CNS by the virus. The interval between onset of illness and death is rather consistent; 50% of the fatalities occur within the first week and 80% within 2 weeks of onset of clinical signs. A variety of complications have been reported which contribute to the 20% of deaths which followed a more protracted illness. Some of these were only secondarily related to the primary SLE infection, but others may be the consequence of extraneural organ and tissue damage caused by the virus infection. The complications most often reported have been lobar pneumonia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, swelling and congestion of the kidney, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure (Brinker and Monath, 1980) . To call attention to the possibility that some of these complicating processes in the human disease might be specific consequences of extraneural virus infection, the present study was designed to determine whether such infection sites are important in the course of the lethal disease caused by the virus in suckling hamsters. SLE virus causes a widespread infection in suckling mice and hamsters when it is inoculated by a peripheral route and involves numerous organs and tissues in addition to the CNS, the principal target when the virus is injected intracerebrally. The CNS involvement of suckling mice was the subject of an earlier paper (Mur-phy et al., 1968) . In the present report we describe the changes in major extraneural organs and tissues of suckling hamsters.",

In spite of the numerous investigations of the natural history of SLE virus-its structure and chemistry, the pathology and pathogenesis of the infection in humans and experimental animals, the ecology of its natural transmission cycle, and the epidemiology of its impact on populations-the disease continues to be a major problem in many areas of North America (Chamberlain, 1980) . Most reports on the pathology of SLE in humans and in experimental animals have dealt only with the CNS, and because most fatal human cases have been in the older age groups, extraneural changes have been attributed to underlying preexisting conditions rather than to specific consequences of the virus infection per se. For example, even though acute changes were seen in the kidneys of one-third of the fatal cases in the initial outbreak in St. Louis, Missouri (swelling and intense congestion of the blood vessels with petechial hemorrhages in the pelvic mucosa) (Cumming et al., 1935) , little has been done to determine the basis of these changes. In the 1962 SLE epidemic in Florida, cerebral vascular lesions were found in most of the 43 fatal cases, but only 3 patients had known preexisting hypertension, 2 others were diabetics, and one was a chronic alcoholic. There was no demonstrable underlying illness in the other 37 cases (Quick ef al., 1965) , but again, a mechanistic relationship to the SLE virus infection was not determined.",

Japanese encephalitis virus, known chiefly for its severe damage to the CNS, has involved the heart, adrenal glands, and gastrointestinal mucosa of some patients (Grascenkov, 1964; Miyake, 1964) .

Attempts to recover SLE virus from the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with CNS symptoms have also failed, raising questions concerning its continued mode of spread within the body.",
