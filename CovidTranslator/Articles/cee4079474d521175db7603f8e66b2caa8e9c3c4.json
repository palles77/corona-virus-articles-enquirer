She regularly worked out and admitted to taking performanceenhancing drugs (PEDs). Clinical findings and further diagnostic work up revealed a diagnosis of perimyocarditis, and adequate therapy was initiated. During the course of the first day, the patient had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated. A diagnosis of bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to an infection by rhinovirus spp was made. A smoking habit, the intense physical training and the use of PED's may have exacerbated the course of the viral pneumonia. After 12 days the patient could be extubated. The length of stay in the intensive care unit was 16 days. After hospital discharge, the patient went to a pulmonary rehabilitation facility for 2 weeks. The outcome was favourable and the patient resumed her strength and endurance training.",

The increased risk of adverse outcomes when these patients need general anaesthesia is well known.

The health risks of self-administered cocktails of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) are largely unknown and often unrecognised. The increasing prevalence of substance abuse due to easy access and its potentially fatal consequences reinforce the need for heightened awareness among healthcare providers. 3 PEDs may increase the risk for infection. 1 Low virulent viruses such as the rhinovirus 4 may cause substantial morbidity in these patients, who should be considered as potentially immunosuppressed.",

The oxygen saturation measured transcutaneously was 99% while breathing room air. The neck veins were flat when examined in the supine position, consistent with an extracellular volume deficit. Faint bilateral basal crackles suggested a lower respiratory tract infection. Moreover, the patient had diffuse epigastric pain on palpation. Her clitoris was hypertrophied. Laboratory tests showed increased markers of inflammation (C reactive protein 16 mg/L (normal <4 mg/L) and leucocytes of 11.8 G/L (normal <9.8 G/L), with mild relative monocytosis of 9.5% (normal 3-8%)). The liver enzymes were slightly elevated (aspartate transaminase (AST) 34 U/L (normal <31 U/L), alanine transaminase (ALT) 45 U/L (normal <34 U/L)) and cardiac enzymes were increased (troponin 3.55 mg/L (normal <0.04 mg/L), creatine kinase 246 U/L (normal <142 U/L)). Haemoglobin concentration on admission was 127 g/L (normal 123-163 g/L) and haematocrit was 37% (normal 36-45%). Initial chest X-ray revealed no abnormalities of the lung parenchyma, and no signs of pulmonary congestion ( figure 1A ). The D-dimers were within normal limits, suggesting a low probability of a pulmonary embolism. With the history of a preceding common cold, typical findings in the ECG ( positive Spodick's sign) and small pericardial effusion in an otherwise normal abdominal sonography, we established the diagnosis of a peri-myocarditis. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with a near-normal leftventricular ejection fraction of 50-55% (normal 55-65%), and confirmed the presence of a small pericardial effusion without haemodynamic relevance. There were no signs of right-ventricular dysfunction and no pulmonary hypertension.",

There she became profoundly hypoxic and was intubated and mechanically ventilated 15 h after admission to the hospital. The chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates (figure 1B). The patient had a systemic inflammatory response syndrome necessitating pressure support with norepinephrine for 3 days. The pneumonia severity index was low (52 points), however, corresponding to risk class II and a predicted mortality of 0.6%. The simplified acute physiology score was 18 points, confirming a low predicted mortality of 2.9%. After extensive sampling, empiric antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and clarithromycin was started, and later switched to piperacillin/tazobactam. Bronchoscopy revealed chronic bronchitis, and cytological analysis of bronchial secretions showed abundant neutrophilic, but no eosinophilic, granulocytes. An RNA sequence of rhinovirus could be amplified by reverse transcription PCR in three different tracheal secretion specimens. Therefore, we established the diagnosis of severe rhinoviral bilateral pneumonia as a cause for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The time course of the Horovitz index is shown in figure 2 , confirming a severe lung injury by the pneumonia. A CT of the chest was consistent with the diagnosis of an ARDS ( figure 1C ). There were no signs of a pulmonary peliosis. The following viral infections were excluded by qualitative PCR: influenza (A and B), parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial, cytomegaly, adeno, boca, corona, entero, metapneumonia and parecho viruses. There was no antibody response to hantaviruses. Testing for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) corona viruses was not performed. Bacterial cultures of blood, urine and tracheal secretions remained sterile, including those taken before starting the antibiotic therapy. No antibodies to the HIV were found.

            "text": "Rhinoviruses genetically comprise three different groups (A, B and C), and belong to the genus Enterovirus of the Picornaviridae family. 4 They are a frequent cause of upper respiratory tract infections including the common cold, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. The incubation period is 2-4 days, the viral shedding may last as long as 1-3 weeks. Infections may occur throughout the year. Patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cystic fibrosis are at high risk of having an exacerbation in case of a rhinoviral infection. 4 In addition, rhinoviruses can cause lower respiratory tract infections, especially in the elderly 5 or in immunocompromised hosts. Using reverse transcription PCR, rhinoviruses were repeatedly found in respiratory secretions of patients with community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonias in intensive care units [6] [7] [8] (table 1) . Human rhinovirus was detected in 24-58% of all virus positive specimens, and was among the most frequently isolated viruses. Very often (up to 88%), the patients with rhinoviral pneumonia had a severe underlying disease, including malignant tumours, or were immunosuppressed. 6 Therefore, the mortality of rhinoviral pneumonia may be very substantial (52.9%). 6 There is no established treatment or prevention strategy for rhinoviral pneumonias in humans. 4 Human rhinoviruses also play a role in the pathogenesis of pericarditis. 9 In particular, group C rhinoviruses were reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections and haemorrhagic pericarditis. 10 Our patient had rapidly progressive, severe bilateral rhinoviral pneumonia, leading to the development of an ARDS, necessitating airway intubation and mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. Her smoking habit, the excessive physical exercise and the ingestion of PEDs negatively impacted on her immune system (figure 3). Smokers with pneumonia are about three times more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit than non-smokers, 11 indicating a more severe course of the illness in smokers, to which they are more prone. 12 Strenuous exercise can reduce immunological defence mechanisms and may increase susceptibility to infections (reviewed in ref. 13 ). Athletes were found to have an increased incidence of respiratory tract infections during intense training periods, which may be due to decreased salivary IgA production. 14 Moreover, exhaustive training sessions lower the neutrophil and T-cell lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood and therefore may compromise both, the innate and the adaptive immune functions. 15 16 The ideal of an athletic, highly performant body, and easy availability of AAS, even from the internet, without prescription by a physician, have propagated their use not only among elite athletes, but also among casual fitness enthusiasts. 17 The estimated prevalence of PED use among members of fitness centres in the Netherlands is 8.2%. 18 Known severe side effects including premature death do not discourage fitness aficionados from regular intake of PEDs. 19 AAS are interloped with the immune system in manifold ways. However, few studies exist addressing their long-term immunomodulatory effects. The exact type of drug used, the dose and the timing of administration often remain elusive. A pathogenetic role was ascribed to their use in the development of severe infections, 20 including pneumonias.",

Nandrolone increased production of interleukin 1\u03b2 and tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 by human peripheral blood lymphocytes, while the interferon \u03b3 production by a human cell line was diminished. 23 The latter may jeopardise the antiviral response in vivo, and may be due to an altered T helper cell function by androgenic steroids. 21 In addition to the desired effect on muscle and bone function, IGF-1 may have an important pathogenetic role in pulmonary diseases supporting airway inflammation and fibrosis. 24 25 Thyroid hormones may contribute to airway smooth muscle remodelling under certain circumstances. 26 Taken together, the immunomodulatory effects of smoking, heavy work-outs and chronic ingestion of PEDs may have contributed to the severe pneumonia in our patient.",
