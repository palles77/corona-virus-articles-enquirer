            "text": "The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies of domesticated animals, scrapie in sheep and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and transmissible mink encephalopathy are more than a scientific curiosity; under certain circumstances their impact on commercial activities can be calamitous. Knowledge of their causation and pathogenesis is still rudimentary, but many consider than an unconventional agent, the prion (a brain protein, PrP), that is not associated with nucleic acid is involved in both. Others believe that conventional viruses, which replicate by virtue of their nucleic acid-defined genes, are involved in the causation and progression of the encephalopathies but that technical problems have prevented their identification. Others postulate even more exotic causative agents. While this paper will particularly address the possibility of a viral aetiology for these diseases, it is also emphasized that our knowledge of the state of the immune system in animals with encephalopathy needs broadening. There are remarkable gaps in our knowledge of the histopathology of these diseases, particularly the nature of the characteristic vacuoles. Much further work is needed on the biochemical changes in the brain and the serum, particularly of the latter as it could lead to an additional means of recognizing clinical cases without waiting for the animal to die with subsequent examination of the brain for characteristic lesions and the presence of protease-K-resistant PrP.",

Accumulations of amyloid and other proteinaceous fibrils occur. These fibrillar accumulations can form plaques similar in appearance to those seen in Alzheimer's disease in man. After a very long quiescent latent period following infection, the spongiform encephalopathies progress very slowly over a period of weeks to months. This group of diseases provides a good example of disastrous events in the field of veterinary medicine that have put into question all our current concepts of the genesis of disease. These events have also had the positive effect of focusing attention on enormous gaps in our knowledge and stimulating a great deal of research. Reference to older literature on scrapie can be made in books edited by Kimberlin (1976a) and Prusiner and Hadlow (1979) . The advent of BSE in Britain, starting in the 1980s, resulted in the appearance of numerous articles on the significance of the spongiform encephalopathies. These include a number of more recent reviews (Little and Thorsen, 1989; Chesebro, 1991; Powell, 1993) .",

The disease had been recognized for some time but it did not become the subject of experimental work until the 1930s, when CuiU6 and Chelle, cited by Gordon (1946) , reported on its transmission. Its accidental transmission during large-scale field trials of vaccination of sheep against louping-ill also gave impetus to research on this disease 1.. The vaccine had been prepared from formaliuized brain and spleen suspensions from louping-ill-infected yearling sheep (Gordon, 1946) . Starting 2\u00bd years after vaccination, scrapie started to appear in animals of all breeds vaccinated with one lot of vaccine. This unfortunate experience prompted transmission studies designed to determine the nature of the infective agent and the pathogenesis of the disease in sheep. Conclusions drawn from the vaccination trials and transmission experiments were that ~crapie, given by subcutaneous inoculation, had a latent period of 2 years and longer; that the infective agent was resistant to 0.35% formalin; that the disease appeared more quickly and in a higher percentage of recipients following intracerebral than following~subcutaneous injection; and that the causative agent was probably a filtrable virus.",

            "text": "Transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME) (Marsh and Hanson, 1969; Marsh, 1976) , which is rarely observed in ranch-raised animals, is caused by an agent with the same physicochemical properties as the scrapie agent. In the first outbreaks of TME, it could not be excluded that the occurrence of the disease had followed feeding of meat and offal from sheep, but the feeding of sheep meat was not involved in a more recent and major outbreak of TME on a ranch in the United States (Marsh et al., 1991) . Three diseases are associated with spongiform encephalopathy in man: Kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and Gerstmann-Straiissler-Scheinker disease (GSSD). Kuru, which is very similar to scrapie, is befieved to be associated with funeral practices involving ritualistic cannibalism (Gajdusek, 1977) . A very full account of this and other human spongiform encephalopathies and follow-up experimental work is given by Brown and Gajdusek (1991) . CJD usually occurs sporadically at a very low incidence but Deslys and colleagues (1994) refer to a group of 25 cases of CJD that occurred in France among children treated between January 1984 and June 1985 with human growth hormone (hGH). The hormone had been extracted from large numbers of cadaveric hypophyses. The cases were confined to individuals with the same genetic status as sporadic cases of CJD, who were homozygous at codon 129 of the PrP gene. GSSD shows a clinical overlap between Kuru and CJD but is familial and related to a point mutation on chromosome 20, which encodes an amyloidogenic protein PrP (Brown, 1990) . As in scrapie and BSE, the causative agent of CJD can be transmitted to experimental animals (Gibbs et aL, 1979; Manuelidis and Manuelidis, 1979; Tateishi et aL, 1979) .",

Sheep were the first experimental animals used for research on this group of diseases (scrapie) and the intracerebral route of inoculation was found to be better than the subcutaneous route for obtaining the maximum incidence of disease. There are ethical, logistical and humanitarian considerations against using large animals for this type of study. The finding that the spongiform encephalopathies were transmissible to certain laboratory animals (mice, hamsters and laboratory primates) was a critically important advance. It then became possible to titrate the infectivity of spleen, brain and other tissues in small laboratory animals, which was essential if any real advance in our understanding of the causative agents was to be obtained. However, a problem with the use of laboratory animals is that they may carry other disease agents in a latent form. The presence of such agents might even determine whether or not scrapie appears following inoculation with infected material and also the progress of the disease.

In mice, scrapie infection progresses more quickly, and if 4-5-week-old animals are inoculated intracerebrally with large amounts of the agent most of them will develop the disease within 10 months (Chandler, 1961) ; in hamsters the disease may proceed even more rapidly (Kimberlin and Walker, 1977) .

The signs seen in scrapie, which are not specific, reflect damage to the neural centres, following the two alternative progressions noted above. For instance, with reference to the louping-ill vaccination trials in the 1930s, louping-ill itself is also characterized by muscle tremor and incoordination of the hind limbs. There may be hypersensitivity to noise and touch. Unlike scrapie, the disease progresses more rapidly. Death follows within 7-10 days of signs of developing. Some of the signs seen in scrapie show points of resemblance. In scrapie, there are also signs of increased skin reactions to pressure and other stimuli. There is a characteristic 'nibbling' reaction and a pruritus manifested by the sheep rubbing, leading to loss of wool over the rump, thighs and tail base. There is impairment of locomotion, starting with problems in the hind limbs (Blood et al., 1983) . Although scrapie is a far more chronic disease than louping-ill, it is curious that variations of hyperaesthesia are observed in both these diseases, with very different aetiologies.",

This latter protein is characteristically resistant to proteinase-K. PrPSc contributes to the formation of the amyloid aggregates or plaques seen in the brain of animals with scrapie. PrPSc is encoded by the PrP gene, which expresses a similar protein PrP-C (sensitive to the action of proteinase-K) in uninfected tissues. In the past, one histological characteristic of the brain lesions seen in spongiform encephalopathies drew much interest, this being the occurrence of large vacuoles outside the outer wall of neurons. No good explanation has yet been found for these vacuoles, which invariably appeared empty by both fight and electron microscopy -the larger vacuoles appearing to have formed by a coalescence of smaller vacuoles. Although interesting, these vacuoles are not pathognomonic, as similar vacuolation has been seen in the cerebrum of mice infected with a parainfluenza virus (Baringer et aL, 1979) and also in lymphoma-prone wild mice (Gardner et al., 1979) .

In Castaigne-Lhermite's disease, histological examination of the nervous system reveals the accumulation of glycogen within the nerve cells, varying from small droplets to large masses. In Wilson's disease, where the onset is most common in the second decade of life, copper accumulates in large amounts in the corpus striatum and in other tissues. While there are differences in the clinical signs and the histopathology shown by both diseases from those seen in scrapie, it was thought worthwhile to determine the glycogen and copper levels in the brains of sheep with experimentally induced scrapie.

Two such agents have been postulated -'prions' and 'virinos'. The 'priori' was postulated to be an infectious protein that directs its own replication (Prusiner, 1982) .

With bacteria and viruses, the infective agent carries its own genetic material in the form of either RNA or DNA, but a decade ago it was suggested that an altered protein can itself transmit the encephalopathies. This is the prion PrPSc (Prusiner, 1982) , or scrapie-associated fibril protein (SAF), which is present as fibrils or rods, 33-35 kDa in size, that can be seen by electron microscopy intracellularly and extracellularly in the brain of animals affected by scrapie. PrPSc is heterogenous on electrophoresis, although this may be due to different degrees of glycosylation of this sialo-glycoprotein (Somerville and Ritchie, 1990 ). Species differences have been found in bovine, murine and ovine PrPSc (Groschup and Pfaff, 1993) . The homozygous PrP genotype has been found to predispose to sporadic CAD (Palmer et al., 1991) and a prion protein missense variant is linked to the occurrence of GSSD (Hsiao et al., 1989) .",

Prion protein and scrapie-associated fibrils are especially characteristic of brain lesions in scrapie (Merz et aL, 1981; Bolton et aL, 1982) . However, although hamster and mouse spleen contain only low levels of PrP mRNA , they can contain large amounts of the transmissible agent. This is hardly good evidence that the prion is the infective agent. Kitamoto and colleagues (1989) were able to demonstrate a correlation between titres of the CJD agent in the brain and spleens of infected mice and their content of PrP, while Czub and colleagues (1986) were not able to do so for scrapie. Unfortunately, it is difficult to resolve this question, since titration of the scrapie agent is attended with wide errors (Marsh et aL, 1984) and the specificity of serological methods for determining SAF/PrPSc is open to question, since PrPSc is produced by the same gene as its homologous normal protein, differing only in its sensitivity to proteinase-K.",

When the hamster gene for expressing this protein is introduced into mice, this species now has the susceptibility to scrapie characteristic of hamsters rather than the susceptibility of mice; the transgenic mice still have to be infected with the scrapie agent (Scott et aL, 1989) . Other evidence indicating that the 'prion' or SAF is not the causative agent of scrapie is given by Braig and Diringer (1985) . Finally, Bueler and colleagues (1993) showed that mice bred for lack of expression of the PrP gene are resistant to the development of scrapie. After the introduction of Syrian hamster PrP transgenes, these mice became highly susceptible to hamster but not mouse prions. Again, it has been found (Xi et aL, 1992; Demaimay et al., 1994) that, following treatment of hamsters with amphotericin B or a derivative of this antibiotic, the accumulation of PrP was not correlated with replication of the scrapie agent. Race and colleagues (1988) described experiments with cloned neuroblastoma cultures with a high titre of the scrapie agent. While these workers acknowledged that a proteinase-K-resistant protein developed with scrapie infection in these experiments, they found no evidence that the PK-resistant form of PrP was necessary for infectivity. They concluded that the PK-resistant PrP of scrapie arose in vivo as a result of alteration of PK-sensitive PrP by changes in the physiological conditions of cells as they degenerate, and that the evidence for the inseparability of the scrapie agent and PK-resistant PrP was still circumstantial, a view not shared by Bolton and colleagues (1991) . Caughey and colleagues (1991) speculated, from further work on these neuroblastoma cultures, that the increased tendency of PrP to aggregate is the origin of this resistance to PK. Lewin (1982) was ready to accept that the prion is involved in the aetiology of scrapie but only as a carrier of a small protein or peptide that he called a protovirin. He suggested two alternative mechanisms by which such an entity could act either as an RNA template or as an extraneous DNA operon.",

This does not rule out the involvement of a conventional virus in causation of these diseases. Although no such virus has yet been demonstrated in infective extracts, many believe that such viruses may be involved. Chesebro (1992) , reviewing the role of PrP in the aetiology of scrapie, raised the possibility that a mutation of this gene increases the susceptibility to an unknown but ubiquitous conventional virus. Rohwer (1991) summarized in a masterful way why conventional viruses may still be the most likely causes of the spongiform encephalopathies. For example, the long latent period needed for the spongiform encephalopathies to develop is similar to the length of time often required by lentiviruses such as the maedi-visna virus of sheep. However, no connection has been made between such viruses and scrapie. A long latent period for disease to develop is seen with other viruses, for example oncornaviruses. Examples are the lymphoid leukosis viruses of chickens; these are noted for their ability to activate the formation of oncogenes. Oncogenes are involved in turnout formation because their presence leads to perturbation of the normal cell physiology. Scrapie is not characterized by the development of tumours but oncogenes could still be involved, tied as they are to normal cell physiology and to gene changes. Studies similar to those now being made in oncology might be most fruitful. References should be made to oncogenes in the human genome, where as much as 0.1-0.6% may be derived from endogenous sequences. One such sequence is the ERV-3 virus, first recognized by low-stringency hybridization to probes derived from the pol region of the chimpanzee CH2 endogenous provirus (Boyd et al., 1993) . This work is mentioned as being indicative of a type of approach that should be undertaken on a major scale with bovine and ovine tissues.",

Some time ago, Carl Eklund stated that 'the scrapie agent is not a member of a unique group of pathogens but is a medium-sized virus whose resistance to heat is analogous to that of serum hepatitis virus' (Hotchin, 1979) . This suggestion seems to have attracted little attention, but there is a strong possibility that hepatitis B viruses (Tiollais and Buendia, 1991) are more widespread than previously believed. Viruses similar to human hepatitis B virus have been found in woodchucks and ground squirrels (Minuk et al., 1986) , while antibody to this virus can be demonstrated in many other animals, including pigs, goats, cattle and especially sheep (Hoofnagle et al., 1983) . Of particular interest, with relation to the virino hypothesis of scrapie, is the fact that another agent is associated with hepatitis B virus. This agent is the hepatitis delta virus (HDV). HDV is a small defective viroid-like RNA virus (Negro et al., 1989 ) that requires another virus, hepatitis B virus, as a helper. Thus, even if hepatitis B viruses are found in farm animals, the search should not stop there but continue with a search for HDV-like viruses.",

The transmissible agent is very resistant to heat (Mould and Dawson, 1970) and to other agents normally destructive to biological materials and it gives the appearance of an ability to cross species boundaries. The first clue to the resistance of the agent came from the louping-ill vaccination trials in the 1930s (see introduction), where scrapie developed following the inoculation of formalinized tissue. While later shown not to be completely resistant to the action of formalin, the agent's resistance to a number of other disinfectants is unexpectedly high for the viruses and similar agents with which we are familiar. Further, studies on the critical size of the agent by X-irradiation and by exclusion chromatography give very different estimates of the limiting size of the agent. X-ray studies suggest a size of 1.5 x 102 kDa, while the much larger figure of 5 \u00d7 104 kDa is suggested by chromatographic studies. This difference suggested to Hunter (1979) , a source for much data on the physical properties of the scrapie agent, that a two-component system was necessary for scrapie infectivity, a small informational component that provides the radiation target, and a larger component that provides a protective or carrier role. Hunter (1979) also indicated that only proteases have much effect on scrapie activity and that, even for this effect to occur, the substantial amounts of lipid associated with brain tissue must be removed. Part of the evidence that led to the prion concept was the finding that the proteinase Pronase destroyed the activity of the agent. This pointed to a need for a protein component for its infectivity (Cho, 1980 (Cho, , 1983 . However, certain tissues contain proteinase inhibitors that can block the effectiveness of proteinases and, in studies on the kind of activity proteinases have on brain extracts, Darcel (1990) found that Pronase, highly active in control tests on sheep l';aemoglobin, had no proteolytic effect on the Hirt supernatant of normal mouse brain. Reasons for this lack of activity with brain extracts should be explored and extended to proteinase-K, to which PrPSc is more resistant that its homologue in normal mouse brain 6. The sensitivity to this enzyme was found to va~ between three stains of the mouse-passaged scrapie agent (Kascak et al., 1985) '.",

It was also an explanation that could be adopted for political reasons and gave some justification for the control procedures that were adopted for controlling BSE. However, it has been pointed out that the human risk from eating mutton and lamb must be negligible since, in a country where scrapie occurs as a disease and where this meat has been eaten for a very long time, the incidence of encephalopathies, such as CJD, that might be expected to follow, is actually very low (0.49 cases per million) (Mathews, 1990 ). Finally, despite earlier concerns, a connection between the feeding of sheep offal and the incidence of TME has not been proven (see above). Avery and colleagues (1960) considered that, if scrapie were a chronic disease caused by an infective agent, the level of gamma-globufin, the serum protein fraction containing antibody, might well be raised. Unfortunately, the electrophoretic patterns were similar for the sera of both normal and scrapie-affected animals. Nevertheless, despite the 'rather overwhelming evidence for \"immunological silence\"' in scrapie, Stites and colleagues (1979) advanced some evidence for the development of an immunological response. They stressed that the lack of detection of an immune response does not convincingly disprove its existence. Whatever the causal agent, if its tropism were entirely neural, then insufficient agent might reach the blood stream to lead to an immunological response. This explanation appears weak, but another possible explanation is that SAF is too close to its equivalent produced by the PrP gene of normal animals to give a response, although it would be expected that even a small difference would lead to the production of recognizable antibody.",

Both viruses have a DNA phase and could well have an association with genes for both susceptibility to the encephalopathies and amyloidal fibrin formation.

It is not known whether cattle are the final hosts, nor whether the infection can spread to humans by the consumption of beef, milk or products, such as bovine albumin used in various forms of therapy 9. With the ability for agents causing the spongiform encephalopathies to cross specimen boundaries, the fear that people might acquire human forms of these diseases from cattle has to be very real. It might be assumed, for instance, that, as a result of the epidemic of BSE through which British cattle have passed, slaughterhouse workers will have inadvertently come into contact with preclinical cases (Howard and Castle, 1990; DeaUer and Lacey, 1991; Coyle and Harvey, 1992) . Scrimgeour and Brown (1991) pointed out that the most efficient means for transmission of scrapie, other than the parenteral routes used experimentally, are via the conjunctival and nasal mucosae and cutaneous abrasions. They suggested that slaughterhouse workers would be prone to this type of contact with microbial zoonoses. The wearing of protective clothing by these individuals when they are extracting the cranial contents from cattle was also advised.",

If BSE presents a hazard to the human population, especially to veterinarians or to slaughterhouse personnel, a statistical study of the occurrence of spongiform encephalopathy over the next several years should show whether the incidence of CJD has increased as a result of the intimate exposure to cattle. The potential risks to which the British meat-eating population has been exposed have led to funding of the surveillance of cases of CJD that arise in the United Kingdom, with particular reference to the dietary and occupational history and other possible risks .

This may be evidence of a familial trait and the practice has been to remove affected family lines in attempts to control the disease 1\u00b0.

If such an effect could be demonstrated, it would mean either that these cases have followed the introduction of genes for susceptibility into previously unaffected herds or that actual infection occurred through the use of these breeding techniques. Wrathall and Brown (1991) stated that there is no evidence to suggest that vertical transmission of BSE occurs and discussed ET and AI studies with scrapie-infected sheep. It has been thought that ET and AI might provide a means for breaking the disease transmission cycle in scrapie and BSE, but such studies will be complicated by the existence of the genes for susceptibility.",

Much more controlled work on the prion is necessary before conclusions of this kind can be justified. For instance, can the material of which prions are a component (SAF) act as a viral promoter of other neurotropic viruses? An investigation of such a possibility would seem to be essential in understanding the role that the prion plays.

Members of this group of viruses have been isolated from spontaneous mouse lymphomas and can infect both murine and xenogenic cells (cells of other species). Special attention is drawn to work of Gardner and colleagues (1979) on a routine retrovirus motor disease. MCF-like viruses have also been recovered from feline (Neil et aL, 1991) and avian oncogene-murine chimeric systems (Feuer et aL, i993) .

This should be looked for, and, if found, removed from the system before applying the proteinase treatment.",

This was later explained as resulting from the presence of live, residual myxomatosis virus (Fenner et al., 1974) . However, cross-reactivation is a known phenomenon by which infectious virions containing active genes from both viruses can result from genetic recombination between an infectious virus and a related inactivated virus (Fenner et al., 1987) My late colleague Robert Kasting became ill some years after we concluded our studies of amino acids in scrapie and normal brain. He felt that the signs of neurological disease that he exhibited meant he had acquired scrapie from aerosols produced by grinding the brains. His brain was sent to the Rocky Mountain Laboratory after his death for detailed histology and for transmission experiments. The results did not confirm his suspicions.",
