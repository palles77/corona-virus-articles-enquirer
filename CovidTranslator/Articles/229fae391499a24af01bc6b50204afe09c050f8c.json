We employ a set of differencein-differences (DID) estimations to disentangle the lockdown effect on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect, virus effect, and the Spring Festival effect. We find that the lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflow into Wuhan by 76.64%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.35%, and within-Wuhan movements by 54.15%. We also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, on the destination cities' new infection cases. We find, using simulations with these estimates, that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of Wuhan, even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities. We find that the COVID-19 cases would be 64.81% higher in the 347 Chinese cities outside Hubei province, and 52.64% higher in the 16 non-Wuhan cities inside Hubei, in the counterfactual world in which the city of Wuhan were not locked down from January 23, 2020. We also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province, but over time, the gap between the officially reported cases and our estimated \"actual\" cases narrows significantly. We also find evidence that enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 Chinese cities outside Hubei province are effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in Hubei province on the spread of 2019-nCoV virus in the destination cities elsewhere. 3 With a population of over 11 million, Wuhan is the largest city in Hubei, the most populous city in Central China, and the seventh most populous city in China. The city is also a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through and connecting to other major cities, and home to 82 colleges and more than 1 million college students.",

            "text": "Human mobility contributes to the transmission of infectious diseases that pose serious threats to global health. Indeed, in response to pandemic threats many countries consider and impose measures that restrict human mobility flows as one of their response plans (Bajardi et al., 2011; Wang and Taylor, 2016; Charu et al., 2017) . However, restrictions on human mobility are controversial not only because of their negative economic impacts, but also because of the uncertainty about their effectiveness in controlling the epidemic. Even if restricting human movement could lead to improvements in disease control and reductions in health risks, it is empirically challenging to quantify the impact of human mobility on the spread of infectious diseases, and to understand the detailed spatial patterns of how the infectious disease spreads. Both granular disease occurrence data and human mobility data (Charu et al., 2017 ) are hard to obtain; moreover, it is difficult to disentangle the impact of human mobility from other potential contributing factors in the spread of epidemics Hollingsworth et al., 2006) . In this paper, we exploit the exogenous variations in human mobility created by lockdowns of Chinese cities during the outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and utilize a variety of high-quality data sets, to study the effectiveness of an unprecedented cordon sanitaire of the epicenter of COVID-19, and provide a comprehensive analysis on the role of human mobility restrictions in the delaying and the halting of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. 1 The fast-moving 2019-nCoV that infected 266,073 people and claimed 11,184 lives as of March 21, 2020 is deteriorating into one of the worst global pandemics. 2 The virus emerged in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei Province of China in early December of 2019, spread mainly through person-to-person contact (Chan et al., 2020) , and rapidly reached more than 183 countries as of March 21, 2020. 3 Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics to combat COVID-19. The lockdown of 11 million people in Wuhan from January 23, 2020 represents by then the largest quarantine in public health history, and offers us an opportunity to rigorously examine the effects of the city lockdown and understand the relationship between human mobility and virus transmission.",

Third, is there evidence of, and if so, what is the magnitude of, undocumented cases of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province during the early stages of the epidemic? And how does the extent of undocumented infection cases evolve over time? Fourth, how many COVID-19 cases elsewhere in China were prevented by the unprecedented Wuhan lockdown? Fifth, are social distancing policies in destination cities effective in reducing the spread of the infections? We utilize reliable datasets on population migration among pairs of Chinese cities and the within-city population movements of each city at the daily level from Baidu Migration, and the city-level daily numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases, recovered patients, and death tolls from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) during a sample period of January 1-February 29, 2020, covering 22 days before and 38 days after the city lockdown on January 23, 2020, as well as the matched data from the same lunar calendar period in 2019.",

We find that the lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflow into Wuhan by 76.64%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.35%, and within-Wuhan movements by 54.15%. We also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, on the destination cities' new infection cases ( Figure 4 ). We discover that the estimated effects of the different lags of inflows from Wuhan and Hubei both show a clear inverted U -shape with respect to the lags, with the largest impact on the newly confirm cases today comes from the inflow population from Wuhan or other cities in Hubei about 12 to 14 days earlier.

            "text": "By providing a rigorous estimation of the impact of within and cross-city migration on the spread of the 2019-nCoV virus in China, our study contributes to fast-growing literature on 2019-nCoV infection, mostly in the medical and public health fields. Huang et al. (2020) describe high rates of respiratory distress, intensive care admission, and abnormal findings on chest computed tomography (CT) in the first 41 patients hospitalized from December 16 to January 2 in Wuhan, as well as a 15% death rate. Chan et al. (2020) investigate a family cluster and confirm the human-to-human transmission of this Novel Coronavirus within hospitals and families. The basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in 12 studies has a mean of 3.28 and a median of 2.79 (Liu et al., 2020 ) (compared to 3 for SARS (WTO, 2003) ). This study is also related to disaster-induced migration, which has often occurred during flooding (Gray and Mueller, 2012) , drought (Munshi, 2003) , earthquake (Lu et al., 2012) , and other destructive climatic phenomena. Given that the 2019-nCoV has rapidly spread worldwide due to human travel and caused severe illness and significant mortality, it is therefore essential to understand the impact of various control measures on human mobility and the virus transmission. Qiu et al. (2020) apply machine learning tools and use exogenous temperature, wind speed, and precipitation in the preceding third and fourth weeks as the instruments to show that the massive lockdown and other control measures significantly reduced the virus transmission. Their results highlight that the population outflow from the outbreak source city poses higher risks to the destination cities than other social and economic factors, such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. Our results are also in line with the results of the latest modeling exercises, which mostly rely on model calibrations of various parameters, such as generation time, incubation period, detection rates, and changes in travel flow. Using the Global Epidemic and Mobility model, Chinazzi et al. (2020) project the impact of travel limitation on the national and international spread of the 2019-nCoV. The study finds that only 24.4% of infected cases were reported as of February 1, and the Wuhan lockdown reduced the cases by 10% in cities outside Wuhan by January 31. The study most closely related to ours is Li et al. (2020) , which shows that contagious but undocumented COVID-19 cases facilitated the geographic spread of the epidemic in China. Using a networked dynamic meta-population model and Bayesian inference, Li et al. (2020) find that 86% of all infections were undocumented before the Wuhan lockdown and reported infections would have been reduce by 78.7% in China, without transmission from undocumented cases between January 10 and January 23. Lai et al. (2020) build a travel network-based susceptibleexposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. They use epidemiological parameters estimated from the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterize the transmission before the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) were implemented. The NPIs they consider include travel bans and restrictions, contact reductions and social distancing, early case identification and isolation. Through their sim-ulations, they find that the NPIs deployed in China appear to be effectively containing the COVID-19 outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Relative to our study, it is important to point out that in their simulations, they assumed that the pattern of population movements was the same in years when there were no outbreaks and interventions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to provide a causal interpretation of the impact of city lockdown on human mobility and the spread of 2019-nCoV, and to clearly disentangle the lockdown effects from other potential contributing factors such as panic and virus effect, as well as the seasonal Spring Festival effect (see Section 3).",

In Section 4, we estimate the distributed lag effects of inflows from the epicenter cities of the 2019-nCoV outbreak on destination cities' daily infection cases. In Section 5, we study how the enhanced social distancing policies, or \"lockdown\" policies, in the destination cities' impact the effects of the population inflows from the epicenter cities.

In the data, the cumulative percentages of the inflow population from the top 100 origination city, and the cumulative percentages of the outflow population into the top 100 destination cities, reach 97% per city on average.

The intensity indicators are consistent across cities and across time. To convert the index to the number of people, we use the actual number of inflow population into Shanghai by airplanes, trains and buses/cars, and the number of within-Shanghai trips using subways, buses and expressways, collected by the National Earth System Science Data Center for the period of February 6 to February 22, 2020. Using this data, we estimate that one index unit in the IMI and OMI corresponds to 90,848 person movements, and one index unit in WCMI corresponds to 2,182,264 person movements. We are thus able to calculate the number of daily inflow and outflow migrants in each city-pair, as well as the number of within-city population movements. 6 Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the population flows at the city-pair-day level and city-day level. It shows drastic declines in the average inflows, average outflows, and average within-city migration in 2020, compared to a sample period in 2019 (matched by the lunar calendar date). The plummeting of the migration statistics due to the Wuhan lockdown is also depicted in Figure 2 . The three figures on the top show the inflows into Wuhan, outflows from Wuhan and within-Wuhan flows, for year 2020 (solid line) and year 2019 (dashed line), matched by the lunar calendar; and the bottom shows the corresponding figures for the national city averages. The first vertical line indicates the date of January 20, 2020 when experts confirmed that 2019-nCoV could transmit from human to human; and the second vertical line indicates the date of January 23, 2020 when Wuhan was locked down. It is clear that while the flows in 2020 tracked that of 2019 well until January 20, the 2020 level dropped to a fraction of their corresponding 2019 levels, particularly after the lockdown of Wuhan.",

As the epicenter of COVID-19, the health care systems in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei were overwhelmed by the sheer number of patients who needed laboratory testing, especially in the early phases of the virus outbreak. As such, the over-extended medical system in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei might have caused delays in the testing of the patients who contracted COVID-19; and because of the delay, some patients who contracted COVID-19 might have self-recovered, or might have died, before being officially tested; and some who were infected with the virus might be asymptomatic. There is also a possibility that government officials in the epicenter cities had incentives to downplay the severity of the outbreak, at least initially. These considerations impact how we use the outbreak data in Section 4.",

First, the virus outbreak happens right before the Spring Festival of the Chinese Lunar New Year, which causes the largest annual human migration every year. 11 Second, the virus itself, even in the absence of a mandatory lockdown, may lead to curtailed human movement as people attempt to avoid exposure to the virus in the journeys and public spaces. We refer to this deterrence effect as the virus effect. Third, for the city of Wuhan and other cities in Hubei that are close to Wuhan, there is also the possibility of a panic effect, in reaction to the virus. The panic effect can lead to an increase in the population outflow from the epicenter of the virus outbreak, and a decrease of the population inflow to the epicenter, particularly the city of Wuhan. The panic effect is likely to peak when the government officially confirmed on January 20, 2020 that the Novel Coronavirus can transmit from person-to-person. In our analysis below, we create a specific pre-lockdown period Before 2,t , which includes the threeday period between January 20 and January 22, 202, to capture the panic effects. 12 Note that while the virus effect applies to movement into and out of all cities, the panic effect is more specific to the cities in the epicenter, especially Wuhan, and can have a positive effect on outflows, and a negative effect on inflows.",

Second, the confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province are likely to be inaccurate for the following reasons. First, as widely reported, the health care systems in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei were totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of COVID-19 patients. This made it impossible to conduct laboratory tests on all patients, which can lead to delayed confirmation of infected patients. Second, during the delay some of the infected may have healed on their own, or have died before being confirmed. Third, local government officials may face strong incentives to under-report the number of infected cases. In Section 4.2, we will evaluate the possible downward biases of the officially reported cases in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei based on our estimates. In contrast, the confirmed cases in other cities are likely to be accurate, as their numbers are not large enough to overwhelm their local health care system; and the incentives to under-report are much weaker in cities outside of Hubei.",

In particularly, we estimate that on January 23, 2020, the day of the Wuhan lockdown, 42.17% of our estimated infections in Wuhan were undocumented in the sense that the number of officially reported cases on that day was only 57.83% of our estimated infection cases. This gap widened over time, possibly as a result of the overwhelmed health care system, and peaked at 80.03% on January 26. The proportion of undocumented infections started to decline gradually afterward, when more medical support and resources were mobilized across China to support Wuhan. As of February 29, we estimate that there were 54,689 total COVID-19 infections in Wuhan, which is 11.33% higher than the official reported statistics for Wuhan -a total of 49,122 cases. The 11.33% discrepancy can be plausibly be explained by the unaccounted for self-healing and death that might have occurred during the early periods of the outbreak between January 23 and early February.",

Indeed, Chinazzi et al. (2020) point out that travel restrictions to and from Mainland China impact the global pandemic of the COVID-19 only if transmission within the community is simultaneously reduced by 50% or more, which suggests that social distancing at the destination cities is crucial in preventing the possibly asymptomatic transmission from the source city. Moreover, quantifying the effect of social distancing on virus transmission is especially relevant to the stage of pre-epidemic community spread when a person who is not known to have traveled to affected countries, or to have had contact with an infected person becomes infected.",

We interpret the human mobility restrictions in the destination cities as an enhanced social distancing policy, because the \"lockdown\" rules in the destination cities are not as strict as those implemented in Wuhan. In this section, we use the variations in the destination cities' \"lockdown\" policies to study how the effects of inflows from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province on the spread of COVID-19 cases in the destination cities are impacted by the changes in the destination cities' lockdown policies, which would drastically impact the within-city population movements in the destination cities. 20 Specifically, we estimate the following specification that is a modified version of the regression specification described by Equation (3):",
