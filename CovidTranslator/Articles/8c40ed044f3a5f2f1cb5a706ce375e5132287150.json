            "text": "Organ transplantation is an effective therapeutic tool for treating many terminal diseases. However, one of the biggest challenges of transplantation is determining how to achieve the long-term survival of the allogeneic or xenogeneic transplant by, for example, preventing transplant rejection. In the current study, CD26 gene-knockout mice were used to investigate the potential role of CD26/ dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPPIV) in allogeneic skin graft rejection by tail-skin transplantation. Compared with wild-type (CD26 +/+ ) counterparts, CD26 -/mice showed reduced necrosis of grafts and delayed graft rejection after skin transplantation. Concentrations of serum IgG, including its subclasses IgG1 and IgG2a, were significantly reduced in CD26 -/mice during graft rejection. Moreover, after allogeneic skin transplantation, the secretion levels of the cytokines IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-13 were significantly reduced, whereas the level of the cytokine IL-10 was increased in the serum of CD26 -/mice compared with that in the serum of CD26 +/+ mice. Additionally, the concentration of IL-17 in serum and the percentage of cells secreting IL-17 in mouse peripheral blood lymphocytes (MPBLs) were both significantly lower, while the percentage of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was significantly higher in MPBLs of CD26 -/mice than in those of CD26 +/+ mice. Furthermore, a lower percentage of CD8 + T cells in MPBLs and fewer infiltrated macrophages and T cells in graft tissues of CD26 -/mice were detected during graft rejection. These results indicate that CD26 is involved in allogeneic skin graft rejection and provides another hint that CD26 deficiency leads to less rejection due to lower activation and proliferation of host immune cells.",

            "text": "INTRODUCTION CD26, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase (DPPIV), is a multifunctional highly glycosylated integral type II transmembrane protein that is involved in a variety of biological processes. 1 CD26 is widely expressed by epithelial and endothelial cells of different tissues, and its expression is strongly upregulated in activated T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. 2 As a serine protease, CD26 cleaves peptides selectively with proline or alanine at the penultimate position of the substrates to modulate their biological activities. A diverse range of bioactive peptides, such as some chemokines, peptide hormones, and neuropeptides, are indicated to be substrates of CD26/DPPIV. 3 In addition to its peptidase activity, CD26 mediates cell adhesion through its interaction with fibronectin and collagen. 4 Moreover, CD26 plays a crucial role in immune regulation. 5 As a co-stimulator, CD26 is involved in T-cell activation and differentiation by its interaction with other molecules with essential cellular functions in T-cell responses, such as adenosine deaminase, CARMA1 and caveolin-1. 5 Owing to its multidisciplinary characteristics, CD26 has been reported to be related to diverse different diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies. [6] [7] [8] Inhibition of DPPIV activity could alter the expression of immune response-related genes, and truncation of certain chemokines by CD26 may affect certain functions of T cells and immune responses. CD26 plays a potential role in different processes crucial for inflammation reaction and transplantation rejection, as well as wound healing. DPPIV inhibitors have recently emerged as antidiabetic drugs because of their reduction of blood glucose through their inhibition of the rapid degradation of incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide. 9 Furthermore, CD26 is also suggested as a therapeutic target for other diseases, such as chronic kidney disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome, coronavirus infection, and graftversus-host disease (GVHD). [10] [11] [12] Annually, >11 million people suffer from burn injuries worldwide, 13 and skin transplantation is one of the most important approaches to treating large-area burns. However, skin transplantation also presents one of the challenges in clinical treatment. The long-term survival of allogeneic or xenogeneic skin grafts is difficult to achieve in clinical therapy because of immune rejection. After skin transplantation, dendritic cells of the donor skin migrate out of the graft and present donor antigens that can be recognized by the recipient T cells. Following allorecognition, the recipient T cells become activated, proliferate and secrete proinflammatory cytokines. 14 Cytokines secreted by different T-cell subsets play a crucial role in the activation of effector T cells and macrophages. 15 The inflammatory stage initiates the effector T cells and macrophages to arrive at the graft site to destroy the graft. 16 Several observations indicate that CD26 contribute to the process of transplant rejection. First, CD26 acts as an important activation marker of T helper 1 (Th1) cells that are associated with the early stage of transplant rejection. 17 Second, recent studies suggest that CD26 is a potential positive marker of interleukin (IL)-17-producing T cells (Th17) and a negative marker of regulatory T cells (Tregs). 18, 19 The balance between Th17 and Tregs is critical for allograft rejection and immunological tolerance. 15, 20 Moreover, recent studies reported that the strong expression of CD26 was associated with organ transplantation. 21 Understanding the role of CD26, particularly its molecular mechanism in allogeneic graft rejection, is crucial in the development of a novel strategy for inhibiting graft rejection and improving the therapeutic effect in clinical organ transplantation.",

As the highest distinct secretions of IgGs were observed on day 7 posttransplantation, the percentages of different lymphocyte subpopulations in MPBLs and MSLs of CD26 +/+ mice and CD26 -/mice on days 0 (i.e., before transplantation) and 7 after skin transplantation were measured. Before transplantation, the percentages of CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD4 + NK1.1cells in both MPBLs and MSLs of CD26 -/mice were lower than those in CD26 +/+ mice, while the percentages of CD8 + and CD19 + did not differ significantly between the two mice types (Fig. 3a, d) . However, relative to pretransplantation, the percentage of CD3 + cells of MPBLs was increased, while that of CD19 + cells was decreased in both mice types on day 7 posttransplantation (Fig. 3b) , indicating a proliferation of CD3 T lymphocytes after skin transplantation. Nevertheless, no significant changes were detected in the percentages of CD4 + and CD4 + NK1.1cells between pretransplantation and posttransplantation.

The release of IL-17 in the serum of both types of mice increased and peaked on day 7 after transplantation (Fig. 5a) Th17 cells in CD4 + cells of CD26 -/mice was nearly half of that of CD26 +/+ mice (22.77 vs. 44.88%, p < 0.01) on day 7 after transplantation (Fig. 5b) . Given that the balance between Th17 and Tregs is critical for allograft rejection and immunological tolerance, the expression of biomarkers of Tregs (CD4 + CD25 + and CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + ) was analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that the percentages of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + in the peripheral blood and spleen did not exhibit any difference between CD26 +/+ and CD26 -/mice before transplantation (left panel of Fig. 6a, c) .

As a costimulatory molecule, CD26 mediates T-cell signal transduction processes through its interaction with adenosine deaminase, CD45, caveolin-1, or CARMA1. 5 Blockade of CD26mediated T-cell co-stimulation induced anergy in CD4 + T cells. 24 In the present work, a lower percentage of CD3 + , as well as CD4 + cells, were found in MPBLs and MSLs of CD26 -/mice both preand post-skin transplantation (Fig. 3 ). In addition, infiltration of CD3 + and CD4 + cells was detected to a lower degree in the graft tissues of CD26 -/mice than in CD26 +/+ mice after skin transplantation (Fig. 7b, c) . This finding indicates that CD26 deficiency results in impaired development, maturation, and function of CD4 + cells, which corresponds to our previous findings. 23 Interestingly, the percentage of CD8 + cells in MPBLs of CD26 -/mice was the same as in CD26 +/+ mice before transplantation; however, the percentage was significantly lower in CD26 -/than in CD26 +/+ mice after skin transplantation (Fig. 3) . The infiltration number of CD8 + cells in the skin grafts was Fig. 4 Determination of cytokine secretion in the serum of CD26 +/+ and CD26 -/mice by ELISA.Blood was taken at the indicated times before and after allogeneic skin transplantation (day 0 represents the day before transplantation). The levels of IFN-\u03b3 (a), IL-2 (b), IL-4 (c), IL-6 (d), IL-13 (e), IL-5 (f) and IL-10 (g) were measured by ELISA. The values represent the means \u00b1 SD of at least seven mice at each time point distinctly lower in CD26 -/than in CD26 +/+ mice after skin transplantation. These findings suggest reduced proliferation, activation, and function of CD8 + cells in CD26 -/mice in response to allogeneic antigens. CD8 + T cells are a prominent component of the allogeneic T-cell repertoire induced after allogeneic transplantation in mice; their cytotoxic activity is directed toward donor major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I peptides. 25 The reduced percentage of CD8 + cells in CD26 -/mice (Fig. 3) after allogeneic transplantation may partly contribute to the reduced necrotic degree of grafts and delayed allograft rejection. Moreover, the percentages of CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD4 + NK1.1cells of MSLs were lower in CD26 -/mice than in CD26 +/+ mice before transplantation, but the difference was reduced after transplantation. It was reported that the inhibition of CD26 increased donor cell homing and improved allogeneic engraftment. 26 The decrease in the percentage difference of CD3 + and CD4 + cells of MSLs between the two types of mice after transplantation may be due to the increased homing of those cells to the spleen in CD26 -/mice.",

While all components of the innate and adaptive immune systems participate in graft rejection, T lymphocytes and, in particular, CD4 + cells are of paramount importance in this process. 27 Once activated, CD4 + T cells primarily direct the progression of the response by secreting cytokines that activate, expand, and/or recruit other effector cells, such as macrophages, CD8 + T cells, and B cells. 27, 28 Through further analysis of cytokine levels in both types of mice, markedly reduced secretion of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-17, IL-4, and IL-13 was found in the serum of CD26 -/mice after allogeneic transplantation (Fig. 4) . This reduced secretion may have been caused by a lower number of CD4 + cells in CD26 -/mice before transplantation; however, impaired differentiation and function of CD4 + cells in response to the allogeneic antigen in CD26 -/mice should be considered. Low serum levels of IL-2, IFN\u03b3, and IL-6 indicate partly defective differentiation and function for Th1 cells, while low levels of IL-4 and IL-13 indicate insufficient differentiation and function of Th2 cells in CD26 -/mice.",

The cytokines first act as molecules initiating T-cell growth and survive during the immune response and then reinforce the Th1 response with positive feedback. 29, 30 In acute rejection, Th1 cells predominantly infiltrate into grafts, in which IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 can induce the activation of NK cells and macrophages, which are strong weapons for destroying allografts. 29, 30 Furthermore, IFN-\u03b3 induces the expression of class II MHC molecules and the secretion of IgG2a and IgG3 from activated B cells. In an acute rejection model, IFN-\u03b3 -/mice showed delayed skin graft rejection. 31 Several studies have reported that tolerance to allograft rejection is mediated at least in part by IL-4, a typical cytokine of Th2 cells, by promoting IL-10 and IgG1 production. 32 Other studies have provided conflicting results, indicating that the administration of Th2 inhibitor prolongs 33 IL-13, which shows the effects similar to those of IL-4, is another cytokine associated with the Th2 response; IL-13 shares a receptor chain (IL-4R \u03b1-chain) with IL-4 but differs in the target cells involved, which results in a series of different biological events. 32 An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that the cytokines of both Th1 and Th2 cells, such as IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-4, are capable of supporting B-cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis. 28, 34 CD26 deficiency results in impaired differentiation and function of Th1 and Th2 cells in CD26 -/mice.

On the other hand, low levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-4 in CD26 -/mice after allogeneic transplantation could impair the activation and differentiation of B cells, reducing antibody production (Fig. 2) . Immune rejection is a complex process that involves a cellular as well as a humoral immune response and is characterized by the production of antibodies by B lymphocytes. IgG, the main component of serum Igs and a common pathogenic antibody in patients with transplant rejection, plays an indispensable role in damaging grafts during transplant rejection. 35 In our present work, low production of IgG and its subsets, IgG1 and IgG2a, was detected in the serum of CD26 -/mice (Fig. 2 ). This result corresponds to our previous findings demonstrating that antibody production was clearly lower in CD26 -/mice than in CD26 +/+ mice either after ovalbumin immunization or after pokeweed mitogen stimulation. 23, 36 This finding indicates that the differentiation of B cells was impaired by CD26 deficiency. In T-celldependent B-cell activation, an interaction between B cells and Th cells and certain cytokines of Th1 and Th2 are required to support B-cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis. In CD26 -/mice, a low percentage of Th cells (CD4 + ) (Fig. 3) and low production of IL-2 and IL-4 ( Fig. 4 ) could lead to impaired activation and differentiation of B cells, thus reducing IgG production. IgG is a major component that mediates allorecognition between exogenous antigens and recipient CD8 + cells during graft rejection. 37 Low IgG production in CD26 -/mice (Fig. 2 ) may therefore result in the reduction of graft attack by effector cells. Interestingly, the secretion level of IL-10 was higher in CD26 -/mice (Fig. 4G) . Supporting our results, CD26/DPPIV blockade has been shown to improve lung allograft transplantation and increase the expression of IL-10. 38 IL-10 is known to be an antiinflammatory cytokine; IL-10 has been reported to downregulate the expression of Th1 and Th17 cytokines in the inflammation process, particularly during Treg cell signaling. 39 Various cell types produce IL-10, including Th2 and macrophages, as well as regulatory T cells. 40 In CD26 -/mice, the high levels of IL-10 secretion (Fig. 4g) might have been the result of a high percentage of Tregs (Fig. 6) . Notably, in response to allogeneic transplantation, high levels of IL-6 were detected in the serum of CD26 +/+ mice from the first day and peaked on day 7 after transplantation; however, only a small amount of IL-6 was detected in the serum of CD26 -/mice until day 7 after transplantation ( Fig. 4d) . Recent studies have demonstrated that IL-6 plays a very important role in regulating the balance between IL-17-producing Th17 cells and Tregs. 41 Thus the low level of IL-17 and high percentage of Tregs observed in CD26 -/mice in this study (Figs. 5 and 6) could have been partly due to reduced IL-6 function and excess IL-10 activity.",

It is therefore not surprising that an impaired balance of differentiation of Th17 and Tregs was observed in CD26 -/mice. Although allograft rejection is traditionally associated with Th1 differentiation, many recent studies showed that Th17 cells and IL-17 were closely associated with allograft rejection. 42 Th17 cells are a more recent addition to the T-cell paradigm, while IL-17, a key Th17 cytokine, is a pro-inflammatory factor. 43 Accumulating evidence suggests that Th17 cells play a role in the development of chronic allograft injury in the transplantation of various organs. The hallmark of Th17 cellmediated allograft rejection is IL-17's ability to recruit neutrophils, which are one of the first inflammatory effector cells capable of infiltrating the allograft after transplantation, thereby causing allograft damage. 42 Fig. 7 Determination of infiltrated macrophages and T lymphocytes in grafts of CD26 +/+ and CD26 -/mice after skin transplantation.The tail skin before transplantation was collected as a control; graft tissues of CD26 +/+ and CD26 -/mice were obtained on day 7 after transplantation. The frozen sections of skin graft were stained with monoclonal antibody against mouse CD14, CD3, CD4, or CD8, and the nucleus was then counterstained with Hoechst 33,342. a-d Immunofluorescence analysis results of infiltrated CD14 + cells, CD3 + cells, CD4 + cells, or CD8 + cells in the grafts of CD26 +/+ and CD26 -/mice, respectively. Photographs are shown at 400\u00d7 magnification responses through the suppression or downregulation of other effector T cells during immune rejection. 44 It was reported that the inhibition of CD26/DPPIV promotes the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 which is essential for the differentiation of Tregs. 45 For the development and function of CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells, forkhead transcription factor (Foxp3) is required. 46 IL-10 is reported to be an important factor in maintaining FoxP3 expression. 47 The high level of IL-10 observed in CD26 -/mice (Fig. 4g) may have benefitted the expression of FoxP3. The reduced Th17 activity and increased Tregs' percentage in MSLs and MPBLs of CD26 -/mice after allogeneic transplantation are assumed to be the most important reason for the reduced necrosis of the graft and delayed allograft rejection in CD26 -/mice.",
