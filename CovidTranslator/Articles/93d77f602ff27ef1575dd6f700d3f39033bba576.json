In this study, we generated a cold-adapted live attenuated vaccine candidate (Aram-P29-CA) by short-term passage of a virulent PEDV isolate at successively lower temperatures in Vero cells. Whole genome sequencing identified 12 amino acid changes in the cold-adapted strain with no insertions and deletions throughout the genome. Animal inoculation experiments confirmed the attenuated phenotype of Aram-P29-CA virus in the natural host. Pregnant sows were orally administered P29-CA live vaccines two doses at 2-week intervals prior to parturition, and the newborn piglets were challenged with the parental virus. The oral homologous prime-boost vaccination of P29-CA significantly improved the survival rate of the piglets and notably mitigated the severity of diarrhea and PEDV fecal shedding after the challenge. Furthermore, strong antibody responses to PEDV were detected in the sera and colostrum of immunized sows and in the sera of their offspring. These results demonstrated that the cold-adapted attenuated virus can be used as a live vaccine in maternal vaccination strategies to provide durable lactogenic immunity and confer passive protection to litters against PEDV.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, belonging to in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales. PEDV is a large, enveloped virus possessing a 5\u2032 capped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb, with a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail [1, 2] . The PEDV genome consists of seven canonical genes, including an open reading frame (ORF) 3, flanked by 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTRs). The first two large ORFs comprise two-thirds of the genome and encode the replicase polyproteins, 1a and 1ab, which are then posttranslationally cleaved into 16 mature non-structural proteins (nsp1-16). The last one-third encodes four canonical coronavirus structural proteins in a fixed order, spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N), as well as a single accessory gene encoding ORF3 between S and M [1] [2] [3] . The virus can be phylogenetically divided into two genotypes comprising two sub-genotypes: genogroup 1 (classical G1a and recombinant G1b) with low-pathogenicity, and genogroup 2 (local epidemic G2a and global epidemic or pandemic G2b) with high-pathogenicity [1, 2, [4] [5] [6] .",

In most cases of porcine enteric viruses that produce clinical disease in newborn piglets before the development of active immunity, the neonates are protected by passive lactogenic immunity derived from the dams [14] [15] [16] . Prophylactic maternal immunization regimens with oral live viruses, including intentional infection and vaccination of sows during gestation, remain the most effective way to stimulate intestinal mucosal immunity that is subsequently transferred to piglets via mammary secretions [15, 17] . Although intentional infection or feedback through controlled oral exposure is extensively used to induce herd immunity, there are several potential risks associated with this practices such as the wide dissemination of other microbial pathogens and the uncertainty of immune induction [1, 2, 15] . Therefore, numerous research groups are attempting to develop safer and more effective live attenuated PEDV vaccines to induce passive lactogenic immunity as an alternative to intentional infection.",

            "text": "In South Korea, a number of modified live virus (MLV) vaccines for classical G1a PEDV came to be widely used throughout the country; however, they were incapable of controlling the impact of the recent massive G2b outbreaks in the domestic swine industry because of limited cross-protection between two genetic clusters [1, 2, 4, 18] . Considering this efficacy issue, there is a high priority for the development of a next-generation MLV vaccine against G2b epizootic or related strains prevalent in the field, which can replicate to high titer in the gut and also boost lactogenic immune responses without giving rise to clinical illnesses. In general, the attenuated virus utilized to prepare the MLV vaccine can be achieved by traditional cell culture adaptation procedures of the virulent wild-type virus in non-host cell lines, but this process is impeded by difficulties in performing laboratory procedures, such as numerous time-consuming, and repetitive passages in non-host cell lines. In contrast, adaptation to growth at low (< 37\u00b0C) temperatures by short-term serial passages in vitro has been frequently used to generate several attenuated DNA and RNA viruses [19] [20] [21] [22] . In this study, we sought to create a cold-adapted attenuated G2b PEDV low-passage strain by progressively decreasing growth temperatures to 32\u00b0C in Vero cells and then attempted to evaluate its protective efficacy on neonatal piglets against virulent PEDV challenge.",

Confluent Vero cells grown in 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes were washed with PBS and inoculated with PEDV Aram-P5 along with trypsin. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, virus growth medium [BMpro-V medium (Cell Science & Technology Institute, Inc., Japan) supplemented with 5 \u03bcg/mL of trypsin] was added. The inoculated cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO 2 and monitored daily for CPE. When > 70% of the cells showed CPE, the inoculated cells were subjected to three rounds of freezing and thawing. The culture supernatants were then centrifuged for 10 min at 400 \u00d7 g (Hanil Centrifuge FLETA5, Korea) and filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm pore-size filter (Millipore, USA). The clarified supernatants were aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C as a viral stock (Aram-P1-CA) for the next passage. In the same manner, Aram-P1-CA was passaged 4 times with step-wise descending temperatures of 1\u00b0C per passage in Vero cells up to 32\u00b0C. Subsequently, Aram-P5-CA was serially cultivated at 32\u00b0C for an additional 45 passages for cold adaptation, and virus stock were produced at 24, 28, 35, and 45 passages that were designated Aram-P29-CA, P33-CA, P40-CA, and P50-CA.",

Thus, we initially attempted to isolate PEDV from clinical fecal suspensions and successfully propagated one Korean PEDV strain, designated as Aram, in Vero cells. The Aram strain produced obvious CPE typical of PEDV infection, such as cell fusion and multinucleated cell (syncytium) formation, in infected Vero cells, which was verified by detecting PEDV antigens by the IFA using a PEDV N protein-specific MAb (Fig. 1A) . Growth kinetics analysis indicated that Aram replicated efficiently in Vero cells, reaching a maximum viral titer of > 10 6 TCID 50 by 36 hpi (Fig. 1B) Virus titer (log TCID /mL) We subsequently determined the entire genomic sequences of the original fecal sample (Aram-feces) and the cell culture-passaged Aram-P5 virus using the Sanger technology. Both the identified genomes were identical in length [28,027-nucleotide (nt)], except for the 3\u2032 poly(A) tails, and showed the typical genomic organization of alphacoronaviruses, consisting of the 292-nt 5\u2032 UTR, the 20345-nt ORF1a/1b (nt 293 to 12601 for 1a and nt 12601 to 20637 for 1b), the 4152-nt S gene (nt 20634 to 24785), the 414-nt ORF3 (nt 24785 to 25198), the 231-nt E gene (nt 25438 to 25668), the 681-nt membrane (M) gene (nt 25676 to 26356), the 1326-nt N gene (nt 26368 to 27693), and the 334-nt 3\u2032 UTR. Compared to the complete genome sequence of the Aram-feces, the Aram-P5 virus had no amino acid (aa) substitution throughout the entire genome, suggesting genetic stability during cell passages. Interestingly, the genome size of the Aram strain was 11-nt shorter than that of most G2b field viruses; this was due to the presence of the unique 9-nt and 2-nt deletions (DELs) at genomic positions 21,051-21,059 and 25,207-25,208, respectively. These DELs are completely absent in the genome sequences of the other global G1 and G2 strains available in the GenBank database. The former 9-nt DEL resulted in a 3-aa DEL at aa positions 140-142 in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein ( Fig. 2A) , while the latter 2-nt (thymine residues) DEL at nt positions 414-415 ( 412 TATTAT 417 ) in ORF3 caused premature termination 414-nt upstream from the authentic stop codon, thereby possibly producing a truncated ORF3 without C-terminal 87-aa residues (Fig. 2B) .

We initially aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity of the cold-adapted Aram derivatives in the natural host.

Furthermore, the immune sera of pigs inoculated with Aram-P40-CA or -P50-CA strain showed little or no neutralizing activity against PEDV. Since our data indicated that only Aram-P29-CA can elicit robust antibody responses in immunized animals, this cold-adapted virus was selected for subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies. compared to 32\u00b0C, indicating impairment of growth at 37\u00b0C.

In contrast, all animals infected with cold-adapted Aram-P29-CA in group 2 displayed no remarkable visible pathological lesions in their gastrointestinal tracts with normal bowel wall thickness, comparable to those in the negative control group (panel B). Microscopic assessment revealed that the small intestines from all dead piglets in group 1 were characterized by acute viral enteritis, with villous shortening and fusion, involving vacuolation of superficial epithelial cells, in the jejunum (panel D). Furthermore, IHC staining showed intense antigen labeling in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells in atrophied intestinal villi with a immunosignal score of 2.3 \u00b1 0.6 (mean \u00b1 SDM) in the jejunum (panel G). However, two out of four cold-adapted virus-inoculated pigs in group 2 exhibited mild villous atrophy in the small intestines, while the remaining pigs showed normal intestinal histopathologies (panel E), analogous to those of the negative control group (panel F). PEDV antigen was rarely present in the small intestines in animals of group 2 with a significantly lower mean jejunal viral antigen score (0.3 \u00b1 0.6) (panel H) than that in group 1 (panel G).

As a substitute, the passive immunity is dependent on the supplement of maternal-derived immune components via mammary secretions (i.e., colostrum and milk) [15, 33] . Therefore, maternal vaccination is the only crucial and effective tool to confer passive protection to newborn piglets through lactogenic immunity against PEDV infection. This objective may be accomplished by the selection of an ideal vaccine candidate, the antigenicity of which is close to that of an epidemic strain, and virulence is minimal or absent in piglets. In South Korea, several G1a PEDV-based live vaccines have been extensively employed to prevent PED for decades. However, owing to partial protection of these historical vaccines against the contemporary G2b strains prevailing since the 2013-2014 pandemic, a demand for the development of new effective vaccines based on the dominant epidemic strain has increased. Although efforts to pioneer a new G2b-based MLV vaccine have been made over the past several years, its success was delayed because of experimental hurdles such as a laborious long-term attenuation procedure in cell culture. It is acknowledged that cold adaptation of animal viruses at serially reduced temperatures for cultivation is the best method to derive a live virus vaccine line, as it is generally accompanied by loss of virulence [21] . In this study, we used a cold adaptation approach with a stepwise lowering of the cultivation temperature in vitro for PEDV attenuation and aimed to determine the immunogenicity and pathogenicity of the cold-adapted strain and its efficacy as an attenuated live vaccine candidate under experimental conditions.",

            "text": "As the pandemic of the G2b PEDV strain ravages the global swine industry, the PEDV field is moving towards the development of novel vaccines and vaccination strategies. To accomplish this task, we first isolated field G2b PEDV that can be efficiently propagated in vitro. The G2b isolate, Aram-P5, exhibited comparable growth characteristics with other G2b strains in regard to cytopathology, infectious titers, and replication kinetics in Vero cells as reported previously [23] . Genetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that the Aram isolates are most closely related to the recent G2b strains prevalent worldwide. However, sequence comparisons with other PEDV strains revealed outstanding genomic features in the Aram strain, which naturally included two independent DELs in S and ORF3, respectively. More interestingly, due to the 2-nt DEL in ORF3, Aram is predicted to encode an alternative ORF3 protein with a large 87-aa excised C-terminus. Although the exact function of PEDV ORF3 remains unknown, a number of attenuated PEDV strains contain their signature DELs in several parts of ORF3, suggesting its critical role in viral pathogenesis [24, 34, 35] . In particular, Wang et al. [11] reported an attenuated PEDV that encodes a C-terminal truncated ORF3 protein of 91-aa residues, which is form the most analogous to the ORF3 of the Aram strain. However, experimental oral inoculation of newborn pigs with Aram-P5 induced severe clinical presentations and macroscopic and microscopic intestinal lesions typical of acute PEDV infection as reported previously [23] . In general, death rates average 50% in suckling piglets up to one week of age, often approaching 100% in neonates less than 3 days of age, and decrease to 10% thereafter [1, 2] . Likewise, our study reproduced 100% mortality in 5-day-old conventional piglets inoculated orally with the 10 \u22122 diluted Aram virus (calculated dose of 10 3 TCID 50 per pig). The data demonstrated that the Aram isolate was highly enteropathogenic in neonatal piglets, implying that the ORF3 product would be irrelevant to PEDV virulence. Since a growing body of evidence proposes that a combination of multiple genetic mutations in S, ORF3, and functional nsps affects the virulence of PEDV, we cannot exclude that the C-terminal defect in ORF3 may be one of molecular and physiological factors that may simultaneously alter pathogenic mechanisms. However, consistent with previous works [24, 36] , growth kinetics of the Aram strain in cell culture supports the notion that the accessory ORF3 gene is dispensable for PEDV replication in vitro. Collectively, despite a redundant role in virus propagation in vitro, conservation of the complete ORF3 in PEDV field isolates still suggests its importance in causing natural infection in the animal host.",

            "text": "To serve as a novel MLV vaccine strain, we generated an Aram-derived attenuated PEDV strain using a cold adaptation attenuation method. Our approach for viral attenuation was to obtain a cold-adapted strain with impaired growth at physiological temperature (37\u00b0C), which can sufficiently induce mucosal immunity in the natural host. The cold-adapted Aram-P29-CA strain was derived by 24 serial passages of the Aram isolate at a low temperature (32\u00b0C). The Aram-P29-CA strain developed unsuccessful in vitro infection at the physiological temperature, as a significant decrease in infectious units was observed. However, this virus showed significantly high immunogenicity in orally inoculated pigs. Furthermore, when investigating the phenotype of Aram-P29-CA in highly susceptible 5 day-old piglets, none of the inoculated animals became clinically sick and grossly abnormal. Our experimental data indicate that the cold-adapted Aram-P29-CA virus is attenuated virologically in vitro and clinically in vivo. Subsequently, we sequenced the entire genome of the Aram-P29-CA strain to decode the genetic mutations that emerged during sequential cell passages at 32\u00b0C. Upon cold adaptation, a total of 12 non-silent mutations arose in ORFs 1 through 5, except for ORF3, without extra INDELs throughout the genome, whereas the two S and ORF3 DEL signatures of the Aram strain were entirely maintained. Intriguingly, 7-aa substitutions were accumulated in the S protein, among which 4-and 3-aa substitutions were distributed in the N-terminus of S1 and S2 domains, respectively, suggesting that some of these changes are associated with viral attenuation. Since the PEDV S protein is heavily glycosylated, altered glycan motifs may be involved in viral pathogenesis by modifying the protein conformation and function [37] . However, no genetic changes were found in the putative N-glycosylation sites between the parental and cold-adapted strains. As the major antigenic determinant, the S glycoprotein possesses at least four neutralizing domains of PEDV at aa positions 19-220 (NTD/S0), 499-600, 744-774, and 1371-1377 [38] . The aa residues that comprise these domains remained nearly unchanged throughout the cold adaptation, except for one N209Y mutation in the NTD/S0 region. Furthermore, no aa changes were found in additional discrete domains, including a C-terminal domain (residues 477-629) of S1 that can interact with cellular receptor(s) and a S2 fusion domain comprising of a hydrophobic fusion peptide (residues 891-908) and two heptad repeat regions (residues 978-1117 and 1274-1313). Although the polygenic traits are likely associated with PEDV virulence, it is of utmost importance that future work using reverse genetics technology should aim to address whether genetic drift, especially in the S protein, influences the pathogenicity of PEDV. In addition, attenuated viruses often have the propensity to revert to virulent form under certain circumstances, which is a main drawback for their use as an MLV vaccine. Indeed, the Aram-P29-CA strain had an ability to replicate at 37\u00b0C since it denoted impaired, but not entirely halted, growth at 37\u00b0C, as the viral titer was determined to be 10 2.5 TCID 50 /mL. This incompletely abolished growth of Aram-P29-CA at the physiological temperature implies a residual risk of reversion to virulence in vivo. Thus, further safety studies will be necessary to evaluate the phenotypic stability of the attenuated Aram-P29-CA virus in neonatal piglets.",

            "text": "To assess the effectiveness of the cold-adapted live attenuated vaccine, a homologous primeboost sow immunization trial consisting of oral administration of a double-dose of the P29-CA virus (L/L vaccination) was implemented at intervals of 2 weeks before delivery. Newborn piglets born to vaccinated and unvaccinated sow groups were inoculated orally with the parental virulent PEDV strain. The difference in the burden of diarrheic disease as measured by mortality and morbidity was investigated between the challenged litters from vaccinated and unvaccinated sows. Piglets born to unvaccinated sows presented a much higher mean CSS, as determined by the intensity of diarrhea, than those of vaccinated sows. After 2 DPC, the challenged animals born to vaccinated (group 1) sows had mild-to-moderate diarrhea, whereas the piglets born to unvaccinated (group 2) sows experienced fatal watery diarrhea. Although nearly all the piglets in group 2 died by 7 DPC, group 1 also exhibited more than 30% neonatal mortalities during the experimental period. On the contrary, our previous trial has shown that a multiple-dose parenteral immunization with inactivated killed G2b vaccines (K/K vaccination) offered a more protective efficacy (93% survival rate) in piglets against G2b virus than that in the present study [39] . In contrast to piglets from unvaccinated sows that discharged high amounts of the virus in feces until death, PEDV fecal shedding in animals from vaccinated sows was greatly reduced at 7 DPC and more than 50% of the piglets that survived shed no virus in stools at the end of the trial. Collectively, the maternal L/L vaccination described in the present study is unlikely to be more efficacious than the K/K treatment in terms of the protective rate; however, it could help alleviate diarrheal severity, including the duration and quantity of fecal shedding of PEDV. Although our L/L vaccination of sows did not entirely avert morbidity in piglets upon a PEDV challenge, its advantageous effects on relieving PEDV shedding would lessen the possibility of the environmental contamination in the farrowing barns, thereby breaking the chain of secondary spread of the virus to other animals and herds during epidemics. Furthermore, PEDV transmission via the L/L vaccination is unlikely, as no PEDV genetic material was detected in feces from any of the pregnant sows vaccinated with P29-CA. Moreover, we were able to confirm the presence of satisfactory amounts of anti-PEDV neutralizing antibodies in the sera and colostrum of L/L vaccinated sows at farrowing and post-farrowing stages, as well as in sera obtained from their offspring, indicating the piglet protection by transfer of maternal immunity via mammary secretions from the immunized dams. These data further strengthen the concept that an optimal vaccination regimen is associated with retaining high levels of neutralizing antibodies in the lactogenic secretions of vaccinated sows, which in turn are correlated with colostrum and milk IgA antibody titers to offer protective immunity against PEDV [1, 2, 15, 40] .",

            "text": "In summary, this is the first report describing the development of a cold-adapted MLV vaccine based on a virulent G2b PEDV strain. The present study demonstrated the loss of virulence of a highly pathogenic PEDV strain, with 12 genetic mutations throughout the entire genome, after cold adaptation. Vaccination-challenge studies revealed that sows immunized with a homologous oral L/L maternal vaccination regimen provides protective lactogenic immunity to piglets, thereby reducing mortality, morbidity, and fecal shedding of the virus. In South Korea, multiple-dose vaccination programs including L/K/K at 2-or 3-week intervals before delivery have been recommended nationwide in pregnant sows for decades [1, 2] . Due to the absence of a new safe and effective G2b live vaccine, controlled oral exposure (feedback) for prime-boost vaccination strategies is mostly implemented as a countermeasure in the field since the 2013-2014 PED epidemics. Despite certain positive contributions of feedback to na\u00efve herds, intentional infection using an undefined inoculum may cause undesirable negative consequences, which include insufficient immunity induction, unexpected virus transmission, amplified viral recombination and diversity; and more importantly, dissemination of other microbial pathogens conceivably evolving to develop into a new disease agent. Once the cold-adapted Aram-P29-CA-based MLV vaccine is supplied in the market, gradual withdrawal of the feedback practice will be imminent. Since oral administration does not have the capacity to ensure that all animals are immunized with a proper dose, this demerit should be ameliorated to easily use the live vaccine under field conditions. With the availability of inactivated G2b PEDV vaccines in the domestic market, customized vaccination programs, such as the application of heterologous oral prime-parenteral boost L/K/K or L/L/K schemes, could be established based on various herd circumstances, including na\u00efve, epidemic, and endemic statuses. It is noteworthy that maternal vaccination has to be implemented in conjunction with additional intervention strategies involving intensive biosecurity, husbandry, and hygiene practices for PED prevention and eradication.",

The S insertions-deletion genetic signature of G2 epidemic strains, that includes two discontinuous 4-aa and 1-aa insertions at positions 55/56 and 135/136 and one 2-aa DEL at positions 160 and 161 within S compared to the prototype CV777 strain, is shown in solid boxes. The Aram strain-specific DELs in S and ORFs are shaded. An alternative TAA stop codon (boldface) and a corresponding premature termination (asterisk) in nucleotide (top panel) and deduced amino acid (bottom panel) sequences of ORF3 are also indicated. ORF, open reading frame; PEDV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; DEL, deletion. Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the cold-adapted Aram-P29-CA strain Like the parental virus as shown in Fig. 1A, the cold-adapted Aram-P29-CA strain caused noticeable CPE and IFA staining showing typical syncytia in virus-infected cells at 32\u00b0C. However, the Aram-P29-CA virus showed delayed replication (late CPE onset) at 37\u00b0C as 9/20 https://vetsci.org https://doi.org/10.4142/jvs.2019.Phylogenetic analyses based on the nucleotide sequences of the spike (S) genes (A) and full-length genomes (B) of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strains. A region of the S gene and the complete genome sequence of transmissible gastroenteritis virus were included as the outgroups in each tree. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using ClustalX software and phylogenetic trees were constructed from the aligned nucleotide sequences using the neighbor-joining method. Numbers at each branch are bootstrap values greater than 50% based on 1000 replicates. The names of the strains, countries and dates (year) of isolation, GenBank accession numbers, and genogroups and subgroups are shown. Solid circles indicate the Aram strains described in this study.
