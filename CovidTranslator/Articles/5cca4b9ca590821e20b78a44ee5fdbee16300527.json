            "text": "We generated a human dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) transgenic mouse in which renal tubular epithelial cells expressed DC-SIGN. The transgenic mice were infected with Candida albicans intravenously to study how DC-SIGN expression affected the pathogenesis of systemic candidiasis. We discovered that, while C. albicans infection induced renal fibrosis in both transgenic and littermate control mice, the transgenic mice had significantly lower levels of Acta2, Col1a2, Col3a1, and Col4a1 mRNA transcripts compared to the controls. KIM-1, an emerging biomarker for kidney injury, along with Tnf, Il6, and Tgfb1 transcripts, were lower in infected transgenic mice, and yet, the levels of Il10 remained comparable to the controls. While renal CD45 + infiltrating cells were the source of Tnf, Il6, and Il10, LTL + renal proximal tubular epithelial cells were TGF-\u03b21 producers in both infected transgenic and littermate controls. DC-SIGN-expressing tubular epithelial cells produced less TGF-\u03b21 in response to C. albicans infection. In vivo experiments demonstrated that renal proximal tubular epithelial cell production of TGF-\u03b21 was key to C. albicans-induced renal fibrosis and injury. Infection of transgenic mice induced a marked increase of phosphorylated Raf-1 and p38 in the kidney. However, ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation was more pronounced in the infected-littermate controls. Interestingly, treating the infected transgenic mice with a Raf-1 inhibitor increased the levels of the Tgfb1, Kim1, and Acta2 transcripts. These results indicate that DC-SIGN signaling, through activation of Raf-1 and p38 and suppression of JNK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, reduces TGF-\u03b21 production and C. albicans-induced renal fibrosis. Our study reveals for the first time the effect of DC-SIGN expression on C. albicans-induced renal fibrosis.",

When under mechanical stress or upon stimulation by cytokines, resident fibroblasts terminally differentiate into myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts play a critical role during fibrosis by producing extracellular matrix (ECM) and crosslinking enzymes and inhibitors of matrix degrading metalloproteinases. 22 Fully developed myofibroblasts express \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), vimentin, and extra-domain A of fibronectin. 22 Their persistence results in excessive ECM deposition and pathological wound healing leading to kidney failure. Factors including transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, fibroblast growth factor-2, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, and angiotensin II are potential mediators of fibrosis. [23] [24] [25] Among them, TGF-\u03b2 is considered a key mediator in fibrotic diseases. [23] [24] [25] There are three TGF-\u03b2 isoforms, namely, TGF-\u03b21, 2, and 3, in mammals. TGF-\u03b21 is the most abundant isoform and the one that is most involved in renal fibrosis. 26 Results from studies in both patients and animal disease models have shown that TGF-\u03b2 is upregulated during kidney injury. 23, 27 We generated a hDC-SIGN transgenic mouse in which renal tubular epithelial cells expressed the transgene to study how DC-SIGN expression affects host responses to C. albicans infection. Our results demonstrated that DC-SIGN expression in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells attenuated C. albicans-induced fibrosis without affecting renal fungal burden. While neutralizing TGF-\u03b2 ameliorated C. albicans-induced renal fibrosis, DC-SIGN expression reduced the ability of tubular cells to produce TGF-\u03b21.

While all of the tissues we examined in the transgenic but not littermate control mice expressed human DCSIGN transcripts (Suppl Fig. 1A ), hDC-SIGN protein was expressed only in kidney epithelial cells and in spleen marginal zones (Suppl Figs. 1B-1F and Suppl Fig. 2 ). SIGNR1 was not detectable in the kidney of littermates and transgenic expression of DC-SIGN did not increase its expression (Suppl Fig. 3 ). Immunohistochemical staining of kidney sections further revealed that DC-SIGN expression was localized to LTL (LTL + ) renal proximal tubular epithelial cells but not to DBA (DBA + ) distal tubular epithelial cells (Fig 1b, c) . It is interesting to note that there were a very small number of DC-SIGN + cells that were neither LTL + nor DBA + (Fig. 1c) .",

Transgenic mice had more intact glomeruli, less renal tubular regeneration, and less prominent renal interstitial fibrosis than control mice (Fig. 2b) . qPCR analysis showed that the levels of Col1a2 (type I collagen), Col3a1 (type III collagen), and Col4a1 (type IV collagen) transcripts were significantly lower in transgenic mice than in control mice (Fig. 2d-f ).

While \u03b1-SMA + cells appeared in the cortex of both transgenic and control mice after C. albicans infection, there were fewer \u03b1-SMA + cells in the former than the latter (Fig. 3b ).

Interestingly, C. albicans-induced KIM-1-expressing cells were LTL + and the number of KIM-1 + LTL + cells in transgenic mice were lower than in littermate controls (Fig. 3e) .

The levels of Tnf and Il6 but not that of Il10 transcripts in CD45 + cells were significantly lower in transgenic mice than in littermate controls (Fig. 5a) . Immunofluorescence staining revealed that neither infiltrating CD45 + DC-SIGN \u2212 cells ( Fig. 5b and Suppl Fig. 5 ) nor vimentin + mesenchymal cells (Suppl Fig. 6 ) were the source of TGF-\u03b21 in C. albicans-infected mice.

Consistent with the results in Fig. 4d , the number of TGF-\u03b21 + cells was lower in infected transgenic mice than in littermate controls ( Fig. 5c and Suppl Fig. 7) .

The results showed that neutralizing TGF-\u03b2 significantly reduced Acta2 (Fig. 6a) and Kim1 (Fig. 6b) transcripts in the kidney compared to treatment with isotype controls. Additionally, depleting TGF-\u03b2 also reduced fungal burden in the kidney (Fig. 6c) , likely due to the effect of the neutralizing antibody on immune cells in addition to its effect on the fibrotic process. These data together showed that TGF-\u03b2 plays a pivotal role in C. albicans-induced renal fibrosis and injury and it has a negative effect on fungal clearance.",

We compared epithelial cells isolated from the kidneys of transgenic mice to that from littermate controls for their ability to produce TGF-\u03b21 after stimulation with C. albicans. The results in Fig. 7b and Suppl Figs. 8A and 8B showed that E-cadherin + renal tubular epithelial cells produced TGF-\u03b21 in response to C. albicans stimulation. While infection did not alter DC-SIGN expression (Suppl Fig. 8B ), epithelial cells from transgenic mice produced lower levels of TGF-\u03b21 than cells from control mice (Fig. 7b) . These results indicate that while renal proximal tubular epithelial cells are the source of TGF-\u03b21 in systemic candidiasis, DC-SIGN expression reduces their ability to produce TGF-\u03b21.",

[33] [34] [35] DC-SIGN transduces signals that trigger the phosphorylation of Ser338, Tyr340, and Tyr341 on Raf-1. 20 We examined Raf-1 and MAPK phosphorylation in the kidney after C. albicans infection. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that while Raf-1, p38, JNK, and ERK1/2 were not phosphorylated in uninfected mice (Fig 8a-d) , C. albicans infection induced a marked increase in the levels of phosphorylated Raf-1 and p38 in transgenic mice (Fig. 8a, b) . Interestingly, ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation was more pronounced in littermate controls than in transgenic mice (Fig. 8c, d) . These results indicate that DC-SIGN signaling activates Raf-1 and p38 and suppresses JNK and ERK1/2 signaling.

Immunohistochemical staining of a lung section from a SARS patient revealed that both alveolar macrophages and pneumo- cytes expressed DC-SIGN. 36 A recent report showed that serum amyloid P and DC-SIGN ligand inhibit the innate immune response to reduce bleomycin-induced fibrosis through binding to SIGN-R1 on mouse lung epithelial cells. 37 A significant correlation also exists between DC-SIGN expression on renal tubular epithelial cells and the severity of tubulointerstitial lesions in the kidney. 12 In this study, we demonstrated in transgenic mice that DC-SIGN expression in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells reduces their ability to produce TGF-\u03b21 in response to systemic C. albicans infection and thus attenuates candidiasis-induced renal fibrosis.

Infection by uropathogenic Escherichia coli causes pyelonephritis, which may eventually lead to chronic kidney disease and fibrosis. 39 Infection by Leptospira interrogans induces renal fibrosis through iNOS-dependent, Toll-like receptor-and NOD-like receptor-independent signaling pathways. 40 Renal fibrosis is a rare presentation of clinical candidiasis. It was reported in 2012 that a 61-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma status had clinical presentation of a mass in the kidney that was later diagnosed as renal candidiasis. Histological staining showed that the kidney had high levels of fungal elements and was fibrotic with evidence of acute and chronic inflammation and abscesses. 41 Another report described a 23-year-old man receiving methylprednisolone pulse therapy for asthma who experienced acute kidney injury and renal function deterioration. The patient had high serum levels of \u03b2-D-glucan and was diagnosed with C. albicans infection in both kidneys; the kidneys had severe interstitial cell infiltration with granulomatous formation and fibrosis. 42 We showed here unequivocally by trichrome staining as well as qPCR that intravenous C. albicans infection leads to renal Fig. 8 Raf-1 and MAP kinase phosphorylation in the kidney of C. albicans-infected transgenic and control mice. hDC-SIGN transgenic and littermate control mice were infected with 1 \u00d7 10 5 of C. albicans intravenously.

Scale bar = 50 \u00b5m fibrosis (collagen deposition) in the late phase of infection, an observation that has not been described before.

Potentially all of these resident cells can produce TGF-\u03b21. 26 Diwakar et al. showed that albumin induces TGF-\u03b21 production by proximal tubular epithelial cells from opossum and human kidneys. 45 In mouse unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) models, UUO-induced injury increases the expression of TGF-\u03b21 by epithelium. 29 We showed in this study that neither CD45 + infiltrating cells nor the mesenchymal (vimentin + ) cells are the source of TGF-\u03b21 in systemic candidiasis. Rather, it is renal proximal tubular epithelial cells that are responsible for TGF-\u03b21 production. While renal proximal tubular epithelial cells are the source of TGF-\u03b21, expression of DC-SIGN reduces their ability to produce TGF-\u03b21.",

The treatment reduced skin fibrosis markers and the amount of dermal myofibroblast infiltration. 47 Our work revealed that neutralizing TGF-\u03b2 significantly reduced C. albicans-induced Kim1 and Acta2 mRNA expression in the kidneys, pointing to the possibility of blocking TGF-\u03b2 as a treatment for C. albicans-induced renal fibrosis. It is interesting to note that depleting TGF-\u03b2 by a neutralizing antibody resulted in not only attenuated fibrosis but also a reduction of fungal burden. It is reasonable to speculate that TGF-\u03b2 also plays an anti-inflammatory role in systemic candidiasis. Its absence enhances immune cell anti-Candida function, resulting in more efficient fungal clearance.",

            "text": "Gringhuis et al. demonstrated that triggering of DC-SIGN activates the serine and threonine kinase Raf-1. 20 DC-SIGN binding to ManLAM from mycobacteria or HIV-1 induces the recruitment of effector proteins to the DC-SIGN signalosome to activate Raf-1 and increase the production of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. 48 HIV-1 recognition by DC-SIGN blocks type I interferon responses via Raf-1-PLK1 activation. 49 In addition, there is increasing evidence that shows the involvement of MAPKs (p38, JNK, and ERK1/2) in fibrosis. 33-35 ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 are activated in the obstructed kidney. [33] [34] [35] Treatment with JNK inhibitor inhibits TGF-\u03b21 expression and rescues renal fibrosis. 29, 33, 34 Cheng et al. showed that there is a positive relationship between ERK1/2 phosphorylation and collagen overproduction in the kidneys from mice treated with blood glucose fluctuation. 50 In Fig. 9 Inhibition of Raf-1 activation increases collagen deposition, TGF-\u03b21 expression, and worsens renal damage. C. albicans (1 \u00d7 10 5 )-infected hDC-SIGN transgenic mice were given Raf-1 inhibitor (ZM336372) (25 mg/kg) or DMSO intravenously on days 0, 1, 3, and 5 after infection. Mice were perfused with PBS and the kidneys were collected on day 6. a Paraffin-embedded kidney sections were stained with Masson's trichrome stain to assess collagen deposition. Collagen fibers were stained blue. Original magnification, \u00d7200. Scale bar = 100 \u00b5m. b The area of collagen deposition was analyzed by the Tissue Studio software. Ten regions per section were analyzed. Percentage of the area of collagen deposition (%) was calculated as [collagen-positive area (blue)/(collagen-positive area + collagen-negative area)] \u00d7 100%. The mean percentages of the area of collagen deposition are shown. The bars represent the mean \u00b1 SEM. c-e The levels of c Tgfb1, d Acta2, and e Kim1 in the kidney were quantified by qPCR and normalized against Gapdh. The bars represent the mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 3 for each group. b-e Data were analyzed by Student's two-tailed t test. *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001 this study, we discovered that Raf-1 and p38 are markedly phosphorylated in the kidney of DC-SIGN transgenic mice after C. albicans infection and phosphorylation of JNK and ERK1/2 is much more pronounced in littermate controls after infection. There exists an apparent inverse relationship between Raf-1 and p38 activation and JNK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. It is our speculation that DC-SIGN expression activates Raf-1 and p38 upon C. albicans infection and that phosphorylated Raf-1, p38, or both are instrumental in downregulating JNK-and ERK1/2mediated TGF-\u03b21 production, resulting in less severe fibrosis in transgenic mice.",
