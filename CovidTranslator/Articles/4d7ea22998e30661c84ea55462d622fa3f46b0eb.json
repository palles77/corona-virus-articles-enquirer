The DoD-Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (DoD-GEIS) was established to support and coordinate these activities at the Overseas Laboratories and in the Military Health System. 10 The DoD-GEIS network of Overseas Laboratories currently maintains surveillance activities in more than 20 countries. These include a global infl uenza surveillance system 11 Among human outbreaks, size ranged from fewer than ten cases (eg, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in Sudan) to thousands (eg, chikungunya in Kenya). Response to outbreaks involving animals included infl uenza A (H5N1) in Egypt, Iraq, Kazakhstan, and Turkey. Overall, the three most common diseases were chikungunya (ten outbreaks in Comoros, Indonesia, Kenya, and Somalia), dengue fever or dengue haemorrhagic fever (ten outbreaks in Eritrea, Indonesia, Peru, Sudan, and Yemen), and infl uenza (nine outbreaks in Cambodia, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Nepal, and Turkey). Laboratory testing did not identify the causal agent but excluded SARS in two outbreaks (in Iraq and Peru) where it was suspected initially because of patient travel history or clinical features.",

Several outbreaks involved diseases recognised by the International Health Regulations 12 as capable of rapid international spread.
