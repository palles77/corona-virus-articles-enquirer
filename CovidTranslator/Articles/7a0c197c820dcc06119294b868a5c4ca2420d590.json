In this study, development of Reverse Transcription-Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) assay based on the 3D polymerase gene for specific and rapid detection FMD virus (FMDV) was carried out. The assay was optimised with viral RNA extracted from serotype O, A and Asia 1 FMDV vaccine strains, which resulted a reliable amplification at 65\u00b0C for 60 min. The amplified RT-LAMP products were identified by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining or observation by naked eye for the presence of turbidity and colour change following the addition of hydroxyl naphthol blue (HNB). The specificity of the assay was demonstrated by the absence of amplification of genome extracted from other viruses or cellular origin. With respect to analytical sensitivity the developed RT-LAMP assay was found more sensitive than routinely used multiplex PCR (mPCR). Further, the assay was evaluated with RNA extracted from cell cultured isolates (n = 50), tongue epithelial samples (n = 150) and semen samples from infected bulls (n = 13). In conclusion, RT-LAMP with HNB dye was shown to be simple, specific and sensitive assay for rapid diagnosis of FMDV infection. Further, the assay has the potential for field deployment and use for rapid FMDV surveillance in India.",

Typical cases of FMD are characterised by the formation of vesicles and epithelial erosions in the tongue, hard and soft palate, coronary band, and feet. However, FMD may not be distinguished clinically from other vesicular and look alike diseases. Therefore, confirmatory diagnosis is made by testing clinical samples in the reference laboratory for the presence of FMD virus and/or viral antigen. Molecular tool such as multiplex PCR [5] detects viral genome, and can be used on samples which fail to grow on tissue culture. Multiplex PCR (mPCR) has been shown to be an efficient and sensitive tool for FMDV detection at the Central laboratory, Project Directorate on Foot-and-mouth Disease (PDFMD), Mukteswar, India. However, during the course of large scale outbreaks in an FMD endemic country like India, the mPCR method is slow and cumbersome to perform.",

            "text": "The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method offers an attractive alternative to PCR based methods and it has been shown to be highly accurate for the detection of RNA viruses [8, 13, 22, 23] . The assay is being increasingly used for rapid detection and typing of emerging viruses, such as West Nile, severe acute respiratory syndrome, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, Chikungunya, and so forth [12, 15] . LAMP is based on the principle of strand displacement reaction that forms stem-loop structure products utilizing the Bst DNA polymerase enzyme and a set of 4 specially designed primers [16] and the reaction time is further reduced when two additional loop primers are added to a mixture [15] . LAMP amplifies target nucleic acid under isothermal conditions, usually between 60 and 65\u00b0C [16] . Therefore, only simple equipment, such as a heating block or water bath, is required, in place of thermal cyclers as in PCR. In addition, RNA can directly be used as starting material as in PCR. The large amounts of gene products from LAMP reaction and the presence of by-product (e.g., magnesium pyrophosphate) make it possible to give diagnosis based on visual judgment of the turbidity or colour change of the reaction mixture with the addition of SYBR Green [12, 14, 16] or pre added hydroxyl naphthol blue [6] . For the first time in India this study describes the development and preliminary validation of a one-step, single tube RT-LAMP assay with HNB dye, targeting the FMDV 3D gene, for rapid detection of three serotypes of FMDV circulating in India.",

Taken together, the optimum temperature for RT-LAMP reaction to produce bright and distinct ladder-like pattern on the agarose gel was obtained at 65\u00b0C (Supplementary fig. 2 ). A reaction time of 60-65 min was found optimum for FMDV genome detection. A minimum 6 mM Mg 2? ion concentration was needed to give a positive reaction product, but no additional change was observed by increasing the Mg 2? ion concentration up to 12 mM. It was observed that as betaine concentration was increased, the amounts of RT-LAMP reaction products were also increased; however, at the concentration of 1 M betaine the maximum amplification was detected. The optimal ratio of primers (inner-outer) was found to be 10:1 with the concentration of 50 and 5 pmol, respectively. After restriction digestion of RT-LAMP product with Bam HI enzyme, the specific ladder like pattern was disappeared and three fragments with approximate size of 148, 97 and 59 bp were obtained (Fig. 1 ).",

Therefore the analytical sensitivity of RT-LAMP assay was found higher than that of the conventional gel based mPCR assay. Further, it was also found that the currently developed RT-LAMP assay did not cross react with BTV, CSFV and yielded a negative reaction with RNA isolated from healthy goat and buffalo tongue epithelium (Fig. 3a, b) .

In India, this is of paramount importance, as most of the time, FMD susceptible species remains in close proximity to each other. Therefore, speed of diagnosis is essential in maximizing the efficiency of control measures which are implemented to stop the spread of infection. At present, detection of FMDV is carried out by a combination of Ag-ELISA, RT-PCR followed by virus cultivation in cell culture. Though these methods are reliable and accurate, they require skilled operator, complex laboratory set-up and several hours to perform. Further transportation of clinical samples from the suspected outbreak sites to the diagnostic laboratory in suitable cold-chain condition can be major constraint for diagnosis and in making subsequent decision for FMD control. Therefore, there is an urgent need of on-site diagnostic assay that would allow rapid confirmation of clinical FMD diagnosis in India. Here we described the development and evaluation of a RT-LAMP assay for rapid diagnosis of FMD. The assay may be used as a supportive method for taking rapid measurements at the site of a suspected FMD outbreak before detailed diagnosis of FMD in the laboratory.",

            "text": "Owing to the high degree of sequence conservation of 3D polymerase gene across different serotypes of FMDV, in the current study a RT-LAMP assay targeting this gene was developed and evaluated for detection of FMDV field isolates from India. The results demonstrated that 3D gene based RT-LAMP assay detected only FMDV (O, A and Asia I) RNA from clinical samples but not the nucleic acid of any other analyzed viral or cellular origin. This high specificity is due to the use of six primers that recognise eight distinct regions on the target sequence. Pilot experiments carried out to optimise various factors that affect the performance of the RT-LAMP assay had shown that Mg 2? concentration and ratio of primers (10:1:5 in this study) are important as described earlier [9] . Further it was observed that increasing betaine concentration increased the RT-LAMP reaction product and the concentration at 1 M gave the maximum amplification product. Two mechanisms have been suggested for the action of betaine: (i) Betaine makes DNA templates accessible for DNA polymerase, and (ii) it is able to destabilise GC-rich DNA sequence [2, 7, 17, 18] . One of the attractive features of the RT-LAMP assay is the ability for the user to monitor the success of amplification by naked eye visualization of a white precipitate. Further, the positive reaction could easily be identifiable with same intensity as that of the ethidium bromide stained gel electrophoresis by addition of HNB. This facilitates the rapid screening of clinical samples without the use of hazardous ethidium bromide and simultaneously prevents aerosol volatilization of RT-LAMP products and its subsequent cross-over contamination. Therefore the currently developed RT-LAMP assay is a simple diagnostic tool in which reaction being carried out in a single microfuge tube by mixing optimised components of the assay and incubating the mixture at 65\u00b0C for 60 min. Additionally, no thermal cycler instrument is required, as no heat denaturation step is used with the template RNA.",

This is due to higher analytical sensitivity of RT-LAMP assay compared to that of mPCR. Negativity in mPCR assay may be due the various PCR inhibitors that are carried over during the RNA isolation procedure. If this is true, unlike PCR, RT-LAMP assay is not inhibited by various contaminates and can be performed after relatively crude sample extraction procedures. Currently used nucleic acid extraction procedure is too elaborate for filed application and simpler procedures are needed. In this case, RT-LAMP assay can be used for amplification of FMDV RNA directly on filter paper bound samples, as described for other diseases [21] .

The generated PCR products were visualized by running 2 % agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining. Serotypes were differentiated based on amplicon size i.e. 249, 376, 537 bp specific for serotype O, A and Asia1 respectively.Sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP assay Analytical sensitivity of RT-LAMP assay was evaluated and compared with mPCR using RNA extracted from 10-fold dilution series (from 10 -1 to 10 -12 ) of O, A and Asia 1 virus culture. The initial virus titers for O, A and Asia 1 FMDV were 6.33, 5.00 and 5.57 TCID50/50 ll respectively. This RT-LAMP products were visualized by changed in colour due to pre addition of HNB dye. The specificity of RT-LAMP assay was evaluated by crossreactivity test with nucleic acid extracted from other viruses such as Blue Tongue Virus (BTV), Orf. Viral RNA from vaccine strains O/IND R2/75, A/IND 40/00, and Asia 1/IND 63/72 was used as positive control and RNA extracted from healthy goat and buffalo tongue epithelium, mock infected BHK-21 cell was used as negative control in each test.
