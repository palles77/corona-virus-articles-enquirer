With recent advances in predictive analytics showing promise for health and disease forecasting, the primary objective of this study was to apply machine learning predictive methods (random forest, artificial neural networks, and classification and regression trees) to provincial PEDV incidence data, and in so doing determine their accuracy for predicting future PEDV trends. Trend was defined as the cumulative number of new cases over a four-week interval, and consisted of four levels (zero, low, medium and high). Provincial PEDV incidence and prevalence estimates from an industry database, as well as temperature, humidity, and precipitation data, were combined to create the forecast dataset. With 10-fold cross validation performed on the entire dataset, the overall accuracy was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.60 -0.75), 0.57 (95% CI: 0.49 -0.64), and 0.55 (0.47 -0.63) for the random forest, artificial neural network, and classification and regression tree models, respectively.

            "text": "The Ontario Swine Health Advisory Board (OSHAB) is an industry organization which administers a PED surveillance program and database under its Area Regional Control and Elimination (ARC&E) project. The PED database allowed for tracing the PED status of individual herds in discrete locations, from time of initial infection until time of declaration of freedom from PEDV infection based on established criteria. As such, it was successfully utilized to obtain PED incidence and prevalence estimates for the province (Ajayi et al., 2018) . With limited surveillance and disease control resources, accurate predictions for PED trends would be invaluable in allocating such resources, and fortunately, the PED database provides data which can be used for predictive purposes. Recent advances in forecasting and predictive methods have shown great promise for both human and animal medicine (Tu, 1996; Leung and Tran, 2000; Er et al., 2010; Mancia et al., 2012) , and it seemed logical to explore these methods to determine the most appropriate one for PEDV prediction. Predictive accuracy of the methods could then be considered as one criterion for selecting the most suitable method for ongoing surveillance, which would contain short-term prediction of disease trends and possibly translate into prediction of resources needed to control the outbreak. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to determine the most accurate machine-learning approach for forecasting future PEDV trends in Ontario swine herds. Specifically in this study, random forest, classification and regression trees, and artificial neural networks were utilized. The secondary objective was to determine variables highly ranked as determinants for PEDV trends. The methods considered in T this study were selected for various reasons. Random forest, based on different metrics, showed slightly better performance in comparison to other methods when applied to similar datasets (Kane et al., 2014; Petukhova et al., 2018) . Among the data-driven prediction methods, classification and regression trees is the most transparent method with results that are easy to interpret (Shmueli et al., 2017) , a feature which may be preferred by end users. In addition, classification and regression trees form the basis for random forests. By contrast, results of analysis conducted via artificial neural networks cannot be directly interpreted through coefficients or through other means, however they have been successfully applied to the analysis of complex relationships between predictors and an outcome, and have often resulted in high prediction accuracy (Shmueli et al., 2017) .",

Briefly, (i) confirmed positive premises had to have at least one RT-PCR positive test for the PED virus, (ii) presumed positive premises did not have diagnostic testing conducted but housed animals that were moved from known positive sites (e.g. nurseries supplied from known positive sow sites), (iii) presumed negative premises were previously confirmed or presumed positive sites that underwent diagnostic testing based on industry standards (at least 10% design prevalence with 95% herd sensitivity), which resulted in all negative tests, and (iv) confirmed negative premises were premises with no clinical signs or positive tests for PEDV for at least 6 months after the presumed negative status had been achieved. The source population for the outcome measurement consisted of commercial swine herds which included: 14 farrow-wean herds (9.3%), 5 farrow-feeder (3.3%), 16 farrow-finish (10.6%), 17 nurseries (11.3%), 7 wean-finish facilities (4.6%), 91 finisher sites (60.3%) and 1 isolation/acclimation unit (0.7%).

However, due to the emerging nature of PEDV in Ontario during the study period, as well as reporting obligations in this phase of the epidemic, this \"undetermined\" status can be equated to negative PEDV status. These statuses were then processed to obtain weekly measures of disease frequency, including number of new cases, herd-level prevalence (expressed as a percentage), and number of infectious sows (expressed as raw counts). The number of new cases was of primary interest and was used to form the final outcome for the analysis, whereas herd-level prevalence and number of infectious sows were a-priori considered as potentially important predictors for the number of new cases and severity of the outbreak.",

If daily weather-related values were not reported for a weather station, daily values from another weather station in the same county, either from the Weather Underground website or Environment Canada's historical weather data, were substituted. Temperature, humidity and precipitation were selected for inclusion for two principal reasons. First, these measurements were readily available from the majority of weather stations. Second, temperature and humidity are reported to influence survival of different viruses (Lowen et al., 2007; Casanova et al., 2010) including PEDV (Thomas et al., 2015) .",

The weekly count of zero is a preferred condition and qualitatively different from other outcomes; trend \"low\" within a 4-week window would not be considered as unusual, particularly during periods when the disease peaks seasonally due to environmental conditions (e.g. winter); trend \"medium\" would be considered as manageable, but would also be reason for further investigation. Finally, greater than 6 new cases in a 4-week period (i.e. trend \"high\") would be considered as an alert and a potentially re-emerging scenario. It follows then that the authors were particularly interested in accurate classification of trends \"zero\" and \"high\".

Regression trees are constructed for a continuous response variable with the final prediction 'y' determined by averaging results across all trees. For a categorical response variable, classification trees are constructed and the final prediction 'y' is determined by a majority class vote across all trees. Furthermore, rather than determine the best node split by looking at all explanatory variables at a given node (as is the case with standard classification and regression tree algorithms), the random forest algorithm randomly selects a subset of explanatory variables at each nodewhich reduces the correlation between subtrees (Ho, 2002) -and then determines the best (or homogenous) binary split at the node.",

Due to concerns about limited observations (i.e. small dataset) and to further validate the model's performance for future observations, an additional approach was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the models. This was based on 10-fold cross validation, which was performed once on the entire dataset using functionality available in the caret package. Specifically, the entire dataset was randomly split into 10 equal-sized groups (or folds), with one fold allocated as the test set and the remaining nine as the training set.

The process of allocating test and training sets was repeated until each fold had been used exactly once as a test set.

However, judging by an overall accuracy of 0.71 on the test dataset and the misclassification error, the random forest model is a close second. In addition, the random forest model generated just one additional misclassification error on the test dataset when compared to corresponding errors generated by neural nets, and the error was a tolerable one. In this sense, random forest performance is comparable to neural nets. Classification trees, on the other hand, was the worst-performing model, a result which confirms a key weakness of the method, which is its inability to accurately capture complex relationships between explanatory and response variables.",

Given the nature of the data, there are few \"high\" trend observations and many \"zero\" trend observations.

Unlike endemic diseases, for which there are frequent infection peaks and lows, emerging diseases typically have an initial sustained peak (usually at the start of the epidemic), after which the epidemic is typically brought under control, preventive measures initiated, and case counts become low or zero. In summary, further work is needed to develop suitable models for emerging infectious disease data, as the number of observations in the dataset are likely inadequate for the training needs of machine learning models (e.g., random forest, neural nets, and classification trees).",

This in itself is not surprising since the biggest risk factor for the number of new cases of a communicable disease is the prevalence of infection (Kr\u00e4mer et al., 2010) . Nonetheless, prevalence and other measures of disease frequency for newly emerging diseases are often changing rapidly, as was the case for this disease (Ajayi et al., 2018) , and are frequently not known with reasonable certainty. Therefore, building surveillance systems which are capable of providing up-to-date prevalence estimates for PED and similar production diseases in the source population would be valuable for making predictions about short-term disease frequency trends. This would require notification at the start of infection, as well as accurate data about declaration of freedom from infection for individual establishments. For PEDV prediction (i.e. PEDV trends), the highly-ranked prevalence, lagged prevalence and temperature variables (from the random forest model) could be a consequence of the nature of swine production in the source population, which to a large degree is organized through segregated phases of production at various locations. For example, an outbreak in a large sow herd will eventually lead to spread of infection from a sow herd to one or more nursery sites, and eventually finisher herds. This requires varying lengths of time, depending on the organization of pig flow in affected farms. Alternatively, for swine herds not connected through pig flow to the existing cases, the length of time for PEDV transmission between existing cases and na\u00efve herds could vary. Yet another possible contributor to the lags are reporting delays due to a variety of reasons (e.g. low clinical impact in growing pigs).",

In addition, while the above-noted situations are possible reasons lagged measures of infection and prevalence are identified as important, the reader should be reminded that in the study population, the status of nursery and finisher herds were tracked together with the status of sow herds. In fact, the majority of sites in the study and in the source population of PED positive herds consisted of sites that were housing nursery and finisher pigs (a total of 76.2% of herds). Therefore, the results may not be extrapolated directly to target populations consisting of sow herds only. However, this source population mirrors the target population of Ontario commercial herds with respect to major demographic characteristics, and both are reflective of the type of segregated production which has been dominant in commercial swine production.",

It is paramount to note that since PEDV is more stable at low rather than high temperatures (Thomas et al., 2015) , PEDV biosecurity measures are more difficult to implement in cold weather. Furthermore, it has been shown that transport vehicles play a critical role in PEDV transmission (Lowe et al., 2014) , and as such, transport biosecurity guidelines are readily available (National Pork Board, 2014). However, some guidelines are harder to implement in cold weather since certain disinfectants have reduced efficacy at low temperatures (Bowman et al., 2015; EQSP, 2014) , and washed transport vehicles are less likely to dry completely as freezing is more likely. The impact of low temperatures on PEDV transport biosecurity has led to the publication of cold weather disinfection guidelines (OSHAB, 2014), application of disinfectants which maintain their efficacy at low temperatures (Ferry and Benjamin, 2015) , and temporary funding for costs associated with enhanced biosecurity for transport vehicles (OSCIA, 2014) .",

In retrospect, classification into two groups would probably be more robust and permit the use of additional measures of classification accuracy. With such approaches, the use of model ensembles could have been explored in a straightforward manner. Furthermore, our decision to reduce the number of variables through the use of the random forest variable importance plot may have impacted the results, as it pre-selected variables that were potentially important for this algorithm but perhaps not as important for the other two.
