            "text": "A tissue-culture-grown enteric coronavirus infected the whole of the gastrointestinal tract and caused enteritis and diarrhoea in a 10-day-old gnotobiotie Friesian calf. Diarrhoea occurred 2 days after inoculation and excretion of virus in faeces and rectal swabs increased until necropsy at 3 days. Virus growth, as detected by indirect immunofluorescence, virus isolation, and thin section electron microscopy, was most extensive in the epithelium of the colon and rectum at 3 days after inoculation. No virus was detected in other organs or in the pleural, peritoneal and oropharyngeal cavities. The origin and host specificity of this coronavirus is discussed. * A number of coronaviruses causing gastroenteritis have been isolated from hosts as diverse as calves (19) , mice (2, tl), pigs (9, 16) and turkeys (22) . However, at present there is no conclusive evidence involving coronaviruses in human gastroenteritis; coronaviruses of man have so far only been shown to cause mild upper respiratory tract infections (14) . In addition to these animal enteric coronaviruses, coronavirus-like particles (CVLPs) have been identified in faeces from calves (18) , cats (10) , dogs (26) , monkeys (5) and man (6, 17, 27) , but their nature and role in disease is unclear (14) . CVLPs have failed to grow in tissue culture; the possible exceptions being the reported growth of human (3, 4) and cat (10) CVLPs in organ cultures. The relationship of CVLPs to coronaviruses is not clear at present.",

The characterization of these isolates is important in order to resolve their origin and to determine whether they are indeed human enteric coronaviruses. It has been suggested by some workers that they may be of bovine origin (14) , as several of these isolates grew in human rectal tumour cells of the HRT 18 line (31), were acid resistant and agglutinated erythrocytes, as has been described for bovine coronavirus (BCV) (12) . Furthermore, these isolates had closely similar polypeptide profiles to BCV and cross-reacted with antisera to BCV in an indirect immunofluorcscence (IIF) test (LAroRT]S, unpublished results). The behaviour of one of these isolates, CV Paris in a susceptible bovine is an obvious prerequisite to clarify their identity.",

Pathologically, no macroscopic abnormalities were observed in the GI tract, although there was a loss of epithelium from the tips of the shortened villi of the ileum. Foci of necrosis occurred within the submueosal lymphoid tissue at this level with a migration of neutrophils into the mucosa and lumen. In the colon a Table 2 ; only the GI tract was infected. The colon and rectum yielded about 107 PFU of virus/g wet tissue and approximately 104 PFU of virns/g wet tissue was recovered from duodenum, jejunum and ileum. The abomasum contained a very low titre of virus.",

Bar represents 100 nm Our results showed that CV Paris had a predilection for the GI tract since there was no evidence of virus growth in other tissues. There was no detectable infection of the epithelia of throat, trachea, lungs and mesenteric lymph nodes. BCV has been isolated from lungs and mesenteric lymph nodes of experimentally infected calves (19) and TGEV has been isolated from many organs of infected pigs (D. J. G~mwEs, personal communication). However, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that earlier low grade infection had cleared from other tissues, particularly the mesenteric lymph nodes, by the time that the calf was examined. Similarly, it might be argued, that the cuboidal epithelium of the mieroabscesses in the colon was a regenerative lesion in the pathogenesis of infection and would not therefore be antigen-positive by IIF. The pathology of infection and the distribution of virus at 72 hours after inoculation is similar to that expected for BCV (20) .",

We conclude that CV Paris is either BCV or a human enteric coronavirus both having specificity for at least two hosts. The recent observation of a case of possible transmission of BCV from calves to man (28) is perhaps indicative of a wider host range of BCV than has previously been recognized. Several other studies have identified alternative hosts for eoronaviruses. ])'or example, TGEV can infect cats (25) and dogs (21) as well as pigs, and feline and canine coronaviruses can infect newborn pigs (33) .
