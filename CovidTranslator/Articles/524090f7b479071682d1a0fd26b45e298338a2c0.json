The study consisted of 6 weeks participant observation and 37 semi-structured, open-ended interviews with community members. Stigmatizing discourses from the late 19th century resurfaced to blame Chinese culture and people for disease, and were recontextualized to fit contemporary local and global political-economic concerns. Many informants discursively distanced themselves from risk but simultaneously reaffirmed the association of Chinese culture with disease by redirecting such discourses onto recent Chinese immigrants. Legitimizing cultural blame obfuscates the structural and biological causes of epidemics and naturalizes health disparities in marginalized populations. This research demonstrates that myriad historical, political, and economic factors shape responses and risk perceptions during an unfamiliar epidemic, even in places without infection. r",

As of today I heard that the owner's son(s) & the entire staff of Fancy Pho have been infected with the SARS. The owner was infected & has passed away recently due to what have seemed to be flu like symptoms. I think its best that you either stay away from that area or eat in. Please pass this along for those who I might have missed. [Email dated April 1, 2003, found at http:// urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl-sars-restaurants. htm, errors in original] During the height of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in spring 2003, stories of infection and warnings (such as the e-mail above) to avoid Asian areas circulated throughout the United States. News media speculated on the possibility of a domestic epidemic, despite the fact that only eight people nationally had laboratory evidence of SARS-and most of these had contracted the virus abroad (Schrag et al., 2004) . Fourteen percent of Americans reported avoiding Asian businesses (Blendon et al., 2003) , and New York City's Chinatown experienced heightened anxiety and fear of stigmatization (Chen & Tsang, 2003) . The above rumor and its news coverage caused a tremendous drop in business and tourism in Chinatown. Even without a single case of SARS, the community was identified quickly as a site of contagion and risk. The American public, including Chinatown, had become infected with an epidemic of fear, not of disease.",

            "text": "This research draws on anthropology, sociology, history, and media studies to examine the production of the dominant American risk discourses during the 2003 SARS epidemic, focusing specifically on those who blamed the disease on Chinese culture. I then use ethnographic research to investigate how these discourses played out in New York City's Chinatown. I use the term discourse in the Foucauldian sense to refer to the contested field of possible ideas, images, and metaphors that structure the ways in which people understand diseases. Many informants rejected community association with infection while simultaneously deploying dominant discourses to blame recent Chinese immigrants as potential infectors. This discursive strategy distances the self from biological and social risk, echoes discourses produced globally and disseminated by the media, and reflects local concerns related to the community's changing demography. The collected narratives illustrate that many historical, political and economic factors shape responses to an epidemic, even in places without infection.",

Patients generally exhibit a fever of over 100.4 1F, a dry cough, diarrhea, vomiting, and eventually pneumonia (Fan et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2004) . From the first known case in November 2002 to its containment in summer 2003, mounting infections and deaths from this unfamiliar disease caused fear and economic disruption as the virus spread from Guangdong, China, to Hong Kong, Vietnam, and other countries including Canada. By the end of its course, over 8000 probable cases were identified worldwide and approximately 900 people had died (CDC, 2003) . Fear of contagion spread far beyond infected areas, likely bolstered by the uncertainty of how the virus spread and its non-specific presentation.",

Individuals and groups may project the risk of infection and death onto an ''Other'' in order to reduce the powerlessness experienced during a deadly epidemic (Crawford, 1994; Joffe, 1999) . In this process of othering, disease origins and risk of infection are explained through moralizing metaphors of cultural superiority so as to locate risk and responsibility among marginalized populations. Such discourses often define community membership vis-a`-vis one's relationship to modernity, a contemporary metaphor representing purity. Those who are labeled as unsanitary subjects (Briggs & Mantini-Briggs, 2003) threaten community health because of their cultural inferiority and thus their status as matter out of place (Douglas, 1966) . This othering is crucial to the maintenance of a healthy identity because the boundaries of the healthy self are never secure (Crawford, 1994) . The identification of a 'risk group' is part of this boundary maintenance that creates and legitimizes the stigmatization of already marginalized populations, resulting in their identification with a disease (Goldin, 1994) .",

            "text": "The media uses familiar symbols to simplify the abstract risk of emerging infections, often by blaming the sick for putting others at risk for premodern diseases by not participating in modern, sanitary society (Beck, 1999; Briggs & Mantini-Briggs, 2003; Farmer, 1992; Moeller, 1999) . Media coverage is therefore a good source of data for measuring the dominant stigmatizing discourses during an epidemic. Othering in media coverage is masked by the prominent position of scientists and by cultural reasoning, whereby anthropological terms are used to describe a population's inferiority vis-a`-vis their culture (Briggs & Mantini-Briggs, 2003) . Indeed, as Barde (2003, p. 161 ) noted regarding epidemiological advances of the 19th century, discoveries of the causes of disease have ''changed only the language of the scapegoating, not the target.'' While many scholars agree on the role of the media in disseminating knowledge and risk discourses, the media's effect on risk perceptions is much debated. Sensationalistic media coverage does not necessarily create heightened anxiety of being infected (Bergeron & Sanchez, 2005; Joffe & Haarhoff, 2002) . Audiences may instead respond to the messages of reassurance (Ungar, 1998) and locate the risk of infection among those othered by news coverage (Joffe & Haarhoff, 2002) . Stigmatized populations may reject being labeled as at-risk by not complying with public health measures that would confirm their inferiority (Nations & Monte, 1996) , while sanitary citizens may position themselves outside the defined risk category to create a sense of protection (Briggs, 2004; Joffe, 1999) . Finally, variability exists within any group around how individuals respond to risk discourses (Joffe, 1999) . This paper considers how risk discourses are produced and the responses of stigmatized populations in places without infection. I investigate the historical and political-economic dimensions shaping explanations of risk and blame during SARS, and the ways in which these ideas contributed to the production of local epidemic narratives in Chinatown, New York City.",

            "text": "In the 1890s, daily newspaper reports disseminated Western medical theories that attributed several plague pandemics to the so-called Chinese ''culture'', further constructing Chinese people as health risks (Barde, 2003) . When the plague hit San Francisco in 1900, the mayor quarantined Chinatown's Chinese residents (McClain, 1988) , which was followed by a national quarantine on all Chinese and Japanese (Edelson, 2003) . The blaming of this and several other infectious epidemics on the Chinese (Barde, 2003; Craddock, 1995; McClain, 1988) solidified the depiction of their communities as diseased, dangerous, and inferior. In fact, the same discourses that blamed the plague on Chinese food and culture resurfaced in 2003 to explain SARS's origin. Govert, & Liang, 2004; Schram, 2003; Washer, 2004; Wilson, Thomson, & Mansoor, 2004) . Several noted that this sensationalization resulted in the stigmatization of Asians around the world (Person et al., 2004; Schram, 2003) , and poor care for those suspected of carrying SARS (Karlberg & Lai, 2003) . Wallis and Nerlich (2005) provide a detailed review of the metaphors used throughout the epidemic in British media. They conclude that the usual stigmatizing metaphors and militaristic language were largely absent, perhaps marking a shift in how the media covers disease. In contrast, Washer's study (2004) , which samples only articles from March 2003, identifies many instances of othering directed toward Chinese people. My review of American media coverage throughout 2003 more closely mirrors Washer's data. As I will illustrate in the subsequent section, understanding the media's role in risk perception requires identifying the media discourses contained in individuals' explanations of risk and precautionary measures, and connecting these to the local historical and political-economic context. Though the media identified many factors that contributed to the epidemic, I argue that othering discourses that fit personal experience and local concerns have more influence on social responses during a frightening epidemic.",

Othering hampers the containment of contagion during an infectious epidemic by compelling people to reject public health instructions (Briggs, 2004; Briggs & Mantini-Briggs, 2003; Nations & Monte, 1996) . Furthermore, it hinders the curtailment of emerging and re-emerging infections by normalizing illnesses affecting marginalized populations. Risk discourses that attribute disease to intractable ''tradition'' label the sick as willfully dangerous and inferior (Briggs & Mantini-Briggs, 2003; Farmer, 1992) . The result is that these populations are blamed for their own infection, and their higher rates of illness confirm their inferiority and marginalization. Thus, sufficient investment in fighting diseases is only justified when they threaten wealthy populations, for whom infection is considered aberrant. As is evident from the 2003 SARS epidemic, international concerns about emerging infections are uni-directional: they are only of importance when they ''emerge'' from a poor population to threaten a wealthy one (Farmer, 2003) . Diseases such as tuberculosis have therefore been allowed to persist among the world's marginalized, contributing to these pathogens' mutation and drug resistance (Farmer, 1999) .",

            "text": "The SARS epidemic illuminates the ways global discourses of risk and blame naturalize the poverty deepened by the processes of globalization and simultaneously contribute to the (re)emergence of diseases. Indeed, many of the discourses in Chinatown reflect concerns related to the processes of globalization that restructure economies and encourage migration. Further, globalization has created global cities, such as New York City, and transnational family networks that are connected by rapid international air travel (Ali & Keil, 2006) . SARS dramatically demonstrates the possibilities for rapid worldwide spread of infections and the need for a coordinated global public health body. Cultural change as a solution to infection diverts attention from the poverty, poor sanitation, and deterioration of public health systems that facilitate the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases, both in the United States and abroad (Briggs & Mantini-Briggs, 2003; Farmer, 1992) . Without access to appropriate drugs and vaccines, emerging infections, such as a potential influenza pandemic, will likely be very severe (Weiss & McMichael, 2004) . As cultural scholars, we must draw attention to the social and biological causes of disease and actively work to find ways to correct the historically entrenched pattern of using cultural reasoning to blame infection on the ''Other.''",
