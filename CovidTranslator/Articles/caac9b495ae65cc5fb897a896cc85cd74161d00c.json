Results: The nontreated and oseltamivir-treated patients were comparable in their viral load at presentation, demography, and the presenting symptoms. No correlation was observed between viral load with age and number of symptoms. Viral load of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was signifi cantly lower in treated than in nontreated patients at day 5 after symptom onset. When oseltamivir was initiated \u0545 2 days after symptom onset, a greater rate of viral load reduction in NPA of treated patients than that of nontreated patients was observed ( 2 0.638 [95% CI, 2 0.809 to 2 0.466] vs 2 0.409 [95% CI, 2 0.663 to 2 0.185] log 10 copies/mL/d post-symptom onset), and the viral load was undetectable at day 6 after oseltamivir initiation, which was 1 day earlier than that of those whose treatment was initiated . 2 days of symptom onset. The viral load was inversely correlated with concomitant absolute lymphocyte count in nontreated patients (Pearson correlation coeffi cient [ r ] 5 2 0.687, P 5 .001) and treated patients (Pearson r 5 2 0.365, P , .001). Resolution of fever was 1.4 days later in nontreated than treated patients ( P 5 .012) Conclusions: The natural viral load profi le was described. Oral oseltamivir suppresses viral load more effectively when given early in mild cases of pandemic 2009 infl uenza A(H1N1) infections.",

The initial animal studies suggested that pandemic A(H1N1) also replicates in the lower respiratory tract and elicits more infl ammatory damage than seasonal infl uenza A/H1N1 viruses. [5] [6] [7] Although the case-fatality rate outside Mexico was comparable to that of seasonal infl uenza, it was much higher in Mexico, and most occurred in those aged , 60 years. 3, 8 Because an effective pandemic A(H1N1) vaccine was not available during the fi rst 6 months of this pandemic, oral oseltamivir was recommended for chemoprophylaxis and treatment as containment and mitigation measures. 9, 10 Although cases of oseltamivir-resistant isolates in relation to the neuraminidase histidine 274-to-tyrosine mutation (H274Y) were reported, most of the viral isolates are still susceptible to oseltamivir on in vitro testing. 11, 12 Oseltamivir treatment had been shown to be safe and reduce disease duration by up to 1.5 days and incidence of secondary swab (NTS) and sent in viral transport medium at presentation and days 1, 3, 5, and 6 after hospitalization.",

Viral load of nontreated and treated patients at each interval post symptom onset were compared. x 2 Test or Fisher exact test were used for categorical variables and independent t test for continuous variables between two groups. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare viral loads of NPA, NPS, and NTS at each interval post symptom onset within nontreated and treated patients. Linear regression was used to determine the rate of viral load reduction. Pearson correlation was used to test the correlations between the age, number of presenting symptoms, concomitant total WBC count, absolute lymphocyte (lym) count, hemoglobin (Hb) level, and platelet (plt) count with viral load, respectively. SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc.; Chicago, IL) was used for statistical computation. A twotailed P value , .05 was considered signifi cant.",

Sixty-one (42%) were male patients. Seventy-six patients (52.4%) were aged , 18 years but none were aged , 1 year. Twenty-seven patients (18.6%) who refused treatment were enrolled as cases and 118 (81.4%) patients who received oseltamivir were controls. Refusals were related to fear of possible side effects of oseltamivir despite counseling by attending clinicians. None had diabetes mellitus or chronic obstructive airway disease. Only two (1.4%) patients had mild pneumonic changes over right middle and lower lobes on chest radiograph, respectively. None had evidence of rhabdomyolysis, myocarditis, or encephalitis. The nontreated and treated patients were comparable in demographics, comorbidity, presenting symptoms, and initial laboratory parameters ( Table 1 ) . Oseltamivir was initiated on the same day (16/118, 13.6%), 1 day (40/118, 33.9%), 2 days (27/118, 22.9%), 3 days complications, such as pneumonia or otitis media, when initiated within 36 h of symptom onset in seasonal infl uenza A. 13, 14 It can be easily administered orally and is the only safe drug in patients with asthma. 15 The evidence of its effectiveness for the treatment of pandemic A(H1N1) remains uncertain. The current recommendations were based on the assumption that pandemic A(H1N1) will have similar biologic characteristics as seasonal infl uenza A/H1N1 viruses. 15 We compared the viral load profi le of the fi rst group of pandemic A(H1N1)-infected patients with or without oseltamivir treatment in Hong Kong.",

In addition to drawing blood for routine hematologic and biochemical tests, a chest radiograph was taken if clinically indicated. If nasopharyngeal specimens tested positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the infl uenza A matrix gene and the pandemic A(H1N1) hemagglutinin gene, but negative for H3 and seasonal H1, 5 days of oseltamivir was recommended at a dosage adjusted for age and renal function. 18 Those who refused oseltamivir treatment were regarded as cases for our study of natural viral load profi le from upper respiratory specimens, whereas those treated were controls. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data were retrospectively retrieved from the computerized Clinical Management System for entry on a standard form for analysis as previously described. 19 The number of classic initial clinical symptoms as predictors of infl uenza infections were used to correlate with viral load in respiratory specimens. 20, 21 These included the presence of fever (temperature \u0546 37.8\u00b0C), cough, sore throat, nasal symptoms, myalgia, and headache. 20, 21 (15/118, 12.7%), and \u0546 4 days (20/118, 16.9%) post symptom onset.

Initial bioinformatics analysis and phenotypic antiviral susceptibility tests showed that the H1N1 is susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir but resistant to amantadine or rimantadine because of a serine 31-to-asparagine mutation. 34 With the dramatic increase in oseltamivir use for treating pandemic A(H1N1) infection, resistance may continue to increase worldwide, including Hong Kong. 35, 36 Even with the availability of a safe and effective pandemic A(H1N1) vaccine, antiviral stockpiling remains an important armamentarium for the epidemiologic control of future pandemic.",

Monitoring viral load throughout the disease course has been used as an objective means of checking the clinical progress or response to antiviral therapy. We showed the inverse correlation between the absolute lymphocyte count and concomitant viral load level in had a greater rate of viral suppression in respiratory specimens throughout the disease course, with significantly lower viral load at day 5 post symptom onset. Moreover, when oseltamivir was initiated \u0545 2 days of symptom onset, viral load was not detectable at day 6 post oseltamivir, which was 1 day after treatment completion, and was 1 day earlier than that of those initiated . 2 days of symptom onset. The effect of oseltamivir as early treatment in suppressing pandemic A(H1N1) was similar to that of seasonal infl uenza, although its effectiveness for pandemic A(H1N1) chemoprophylaxis was not yet established. 14 Fever subsided 1.4 days earlier in treated patients, which is consistent with previous fi ndings that oseltamivir shortens fever duration and reduces the quantity and duration of viral shedding in adults with seasonal infl uenza. 14, 27, 28 Although oseltamivir was shown to hasten recovery and reduce viral load in this study, its long-term effectiveness for pandemic A(H1N1) remains uncertain.

But these factors are unlikely to affect the overall conclusion of this study because the results were similar when only nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed. Similar to previous studies, oseltamivir is associated with few side effects. The most frequent side effects are gastrointestinal symptoms, which occurred in up to 40% of school children who received oseltamivir prophylaxis for the infl uenza A(H1N1) virus. 46 Previous reports suggesting serious neuropsychiatric manifestations after oseltamivir were not demonstrated in later studies and only 18% of school children taking oseltamivir prophylaxis had reported mild symptoms.
