Gender is a variable that commonly is controlled for in an analysis; however, it is rare to find a separate examination into the role that gender plays on disease outcome [1] . In studies of occupational environments that are dominated by men, often there is no distinction by gender or women are excluded from the analysis [2, 3] . Greenberg and Dement [1] reported that as recently as 1992, 38% fewer occupational health articles were listed on MedLine that addressed the effects of occupational exposures on the lung health of women compared with men.

The study of occupational lung disease in women involves much more than determining if women have an increased or decreased susceptibility to various toxins and particles compared with men. It involves applying a ''gendered-based lens'' to all aspects of the research process to ensure an accurate representation of the risks to respiratory health that are associated with occupation. Therefore, our discussion begins with an overview of how gender issues may impact the study of occupational lung disease. We examine how research methodology, including classification of occupation, measurement of exposure, and identification of disease cases, can be impacted by gender. We conclude by reviewing the literature on the current state of knowledge regarding women and several common occupational lung diseases: asbestosis, silicosis, lung cancer, and occupational asthma, as well as predisease respiratory signs and symptoms that relate to occupational exposure.",

Over a lifetime, the female lung tends to be smaller than the male lung in individuals of the same height. On average, vital capacity and total lung capacity are greater in adult males, yet female lungs have higher forced expiratory flow rates and forced expiratory volume in 1 second:forced vital capacity (FEV 1 :FVC) ratios, even after standardizing for differences in body size [5] . Despite this evidence, we continue to have little understanding as to how physical and physiologic sex differences might impact overall susceptibility to occupational disease. In addition, any measurement of occupational disease susceptibility must include accurate exposure measurement, yet we have little understanding regarding the influence gender may have on the exposure to, and measurement of, various occupational toxins and agents. Research that investigates women's health and occupational lung disease must consider possible sex differences in susceptibility to various exposures and development of occupational lung disease (ie, there may be differential rates of absorption of toxins in men or women). There also are likely to be gender influences on the occupational environment that will impact the investigation process.",

In Canada and the United States, men continue to hold most positions in the primary and secondary industries, such as logging, fishing, and manufacturing, whereas women hold most of the jobs in the service industries, including health care, retail, and clerical sectors [6, 7] . Although it may be assumed that this segregation in the workplace clusters men in ''high-risk'' jobs such as mining and smelting, in actuality, women are exposed routinely to hazardous materials on the job, even in those industries that are considered to be ''safe.'' Stellman [8] reported that women commonly are exposed to a large number of carcinogenic substances in the workplace. She identified 46 different carcinogens that were used commonly in industries that employed a minimum of 25,000 women in the United States in 1992, including the service and the health care industries. Many other hazardous chemicals and agents have been found in other occupational environments where a large proportion of women are employed ( Table 1 ). The workplace environment continues to change for women, as there has been a shift toward more women being employed in traditionally ''male'' occupations and vice versa.",

            "text": "Although it is recognized that men and women are exposed to different occupational hazards because of their segregation in the workforce, less attention has been paid to differing exposures between men and women who have the same job title. Segregation of task by gender can occur in the workplace which results in differing exposures between men and women with the same job title [9] . For example, Messing and colleagues [10] reported that male cleaners who worked in the railway industry often were assigned different tasks than female cleaners. Female cleaners consistently were assigned to toilet-cleaning tasks, whereas male cleaners were responsible for floor mopping. The women worked in closer proximity to the cleaning fumes compared to men, resulting in different levels of exposure. In a different study, Messing et al [11] reported that male and female gardeners who were employed by city hall in a Quebec municipality were assigned different tasks, either because of personal choice or the lack of appropriate-sized equipment for women. In a recent study of university employees, women reported more physical and malaise symptoms than their male counterparts in the same job [12] . There were no gender differences after controlling for occupation grade, perceived working conditions, and orientation to gender roles. The investigators concluded that differential exposure, rather than differential vulnerability, influenced the gender differences in health. These studies show that job classification alone often is a poor proxy for exposure. A woman may be assigned to different tasks with different exposures compared with men, or her work environment may differ from other workers in different industries that have the same job title. For example, a woman whose job is classified as ''secretary'' may be employed in a sawmill and be exposed to levels of wood dust or wood antigens that are sufficiently high to elicit a lung response.",

The measurement of occupational exposures is integral to the understanding of how exposures impact health and the development of appropriate preventative guidelines [13] . The goal of exposure measurement is to ''define and quantify an individual's dose of a specific agent'' [13] ; specifically, the biologically effective dose that is capable of causing disease. One rarely can measure the actual biologically effective dose; instead, an estimate of the effective dose is calculated based on the amount of agent that is present in the work environment and the amount of time that a worker is exposed.",

Nevertheless, gender can impact how much of the toxin passes the protective equipment barrier and enters the protected environment. Personal protective equipment, such as gloves or respirators, may not be designed to fit a woman's body; this may result in an increased exposure. Greenberg and Dement [1] identified this problem as a potential confounder in occupational health research and noted that although it was recognized as a problem as early as 1942 [17] , little research has been done to determine the impact of improperly-fitting protective equipment on women's occupational health. A Korean study of three commonly-used respirators found decreased fit factors (indicating less protection) among women compared with men, even after taking differences in facial dimensions into account [18] . In addition, the education on, and use of, protective equipment or other safety training may be impacted by gender. Women are more likely to be employed on a part-time or temporary basis [19, 20] , which may result in fewer opportunities for adequate training in personal protective practices. It also may be more physically demanding for women to wear protective equipment compared with men. Murphy et al [21] reported that compared with men, women experienced a greater increase in percent of VO2 max and rating of perceived exertion while wearing chemical protective clothing (compared with wearing regular clothing) and engaging in continuous activity. This greater increase in energy cost while wearing protective clothing may provide a disincentive to women, especially if it affects a woman's capacity to perform in a male-dominated work environment.",

They found that although the reporting of symptoms was similar between older male and female subjects, the diagnosis of asthma and chronic bronchitis was more frequent in women, whereas emphysema was diagnosed more often for the men. If men and women who have occupational lung disease are identified based on compensation claims, gender differences in claim success could bias the results. This was shown by Lippel [25] for chronic stress claims; in a sample of 185 compensation applications, women who applied for chronic stress claims were significantly less likely to have their claim accepted by a review board than men. In contrast, a Canadian study showed that the relative proportion of men and women was consistent across the three claim categories of ''confirmed occupational asthma,'' ''nonoccupational asthma,'' or ''no asthma'' [26] ; this suggested no gender difference in claim success.",

Crystalline silica is abundant in many types of stone, such as sandstone, granite, or shale [31] or can be converted from noncrystalline silica in several manufacturing processes. Exposure to heavy amounts of dust over a long time period is necessary to develop chronic silicosis. The clinical symptoms of dyspnea, cough, and sputum production often are not present until the disease is advanced. In the absence of regular screening, it is likely that silicosis is underdiagnosed. Historically, excessive silica exposure was considered to be confined to certain industries, namely metal and coal mining and foundries [32] that traditionally hired a high proportion of male employees. United States' regulations regarding the permissible levels of silica exposures were based upon research done in the 1920s and 1930s on male workers in the Vermont granite industry. Silica also is present in high levels in the ceramic industry, which employs large numbers of female workers.",

They concluded that an association between duration of exposure and silicosis was similar between the women in their study and a similar population of men in another study; however, the men demonstrated more severe disease with fewer years of exposure.

They also compared female workers from the pottery industry with male workers in the quartz processing industry, who were considered to have a high risk for silica exposure. Female workers had a higher rate of progression of disease, despite working in an environment that had supposed lower rates of exposure. This study generated data from an occupational disease registry without individual contact with the workers. It is not clear how the tasks that the men and women performed differed, and whether this resulted in different levels of dust exposure.

Davies et al [27] measured the prevalence of asbestos-related disease in 770 black women in the northern province of South Africa; 99% had worked in the amosite asbestos mine industry. The mines had closed 20 years earlier but the women had never been investigated for asbestos-related disease, such as asbestosis. Seventy-four percent of the women had begun working in the mines before they were 24 years old; the majority (60%) had worked in the mines for 10 years or less. Mining companies did not keep labor records on women and vital statistics are poorly kept; it was not possible to confirm the completeness of their sample or to measure the survivor effect. Nevertheless, 97% of the women had a clinical diagnosis of asbestosis that was based on history of occupational exposure, clinical findings, and radiographic evidence. Women and young children were employed in the high-exposure work of manually removing rock from ''cobs'' of asbestos fiber with hammers, a practice that was only outlawed in 1973.",

They compared these individuals with 176 male and 98 female controls. Radiographic asbestosis was seen in 35.2% of the men and 16.5% of the women and reduced lung volumes were associated with asbestos exposure in both sexes. Exposure duration (mean 22 years in men; 18 years in women) was associated with decreased lung function in male workers but not in female workers. Their data suggested that radiographic parenchymal abnormalities were more closely associated with reduced lung function in women compared with men and pleural abnormalities were more strongly associated with reduced lung function in men. Because few women had pleural abnormalities, this finding could not be explored in sufficient detail. Because the only method of estimating exposure in this study was to use duration of employment, it is possible that the gender differences could be attributed to differences in exposure intensity.",

Lung cancer due to exposure to dry cleaning fluids were investigated by Brownson et al [49] who found a significant risk for lung cancer (OR 2.9; confidence interval 1.5 -5.4) although an earlier study by Katz and Jowett [50] did not demonstrate this risk. Workers who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke also have elevated risks for respiratory cancers. For instance, Dimich-Ward et al [51] found elevated proportionate mortality ratios for lung cancer among bartenders, waiters, and waitresses. A California study of occupational mortality in women found that waitresses have high risks for lung cancer (standardized mortality ratio: 368) [52] . A standardized incidence ratio of 2.3 for lung cancer was observed in study of a large cohort of waitresses in Norway [53] .",

They found higher standardized-mortality ratios (SMRs) for white men compared with white women or black men for every disease analyzed, including all cancers and respiratory disease. Gender differences in follow-up explained much of the apparent difference in mortality. Although only 1.5% of the white men had an unknown vital status at the end of the study period, 22.8% of the white women were in this category. When the analysis corrected for the missing data, the SMRs for all causes of death and for lung cancer in white women increased from a statistically significant deficit to a statistically significant increased risk associated with asbestos exposure. The investigators reported that women had work histories of short duration and the lack of accurate follow-up likely underestimated the SMRs compared with men.",

Gender differences in nonoccupational asthma [63] and bronchial hyperresponsiveness [64 -66] were reported; it may not be possible to sort out those aspects of asthma that are related uniquely to occupational exposures and moderated by gender. In some countries, the prevalence of OA is higher in men [67, 68] , but in others, the rates seem to be similar [69, 70] . In the United Kingdom, surveillance data suggested higher rates in men than women; however, when the occupation was taken into consideration the rates were similar in both sexes [71] .

In many industrialized countries, OA is significantly associated with exposure to cleaning products; one report showed that 11 of 12 studies of cleaners found an excess risk of asthma [70] . Women are disproportionately employed as cleaners in many industries and are responsible for a disproportionate share of cleaning tasks in the household. Kogevinas estimated that 5% of the asthma risk in women could be attributed definitively to household exposure. This ''double-shift'' phenomenon, where women are exposed to cleaning products at work and at home, may not be captured adequately in the data. In addition, asthma due to exposure at work and home may not be classified as OA; this could lead to an underdiagnosis in women.",

It is suggested that more attention should be given to these ''predisease'' indicators. Messing [77] stated that ''a requirement for diagnosed pathology may be premature when studying women's occupational health'' because we do not have a comprehensive understanding of how occupational lung disease in women manifests compared with men. Focusing purely on a specific diagnosis may ignore novel diseases or manifestations of common lung diseases that are unique to women.",

Not unexpectedly, there is little evidence of a clear pattern of susceptibility. Although gender differences have been identified, they are not consistent from study to study [78 -82] . In population-based studies (of lung disease in general), more consistent gender differences in symptom reporting have been seen. The analysis of 18,277 participants in a European Community Respiratory Health Survey showed that women were more likely to report nocturnal and nonproductive cough [83] . Possible explanations given include physiologic differences (females have more sensitive cough receptors), hormonal differences (female sex hormones can affect airway smooth muscle and bronchial hyperresponsiveness), and possible gender bias that are due to differences in reporting. According to the review by Becklake and Kauffmann [5] shortness of breath is reported more frequently and consistently by women in population-based studies. This may be attributed to differences in the perception of shortness of breath that are related to the interaction of environmental, sociocultural, and biologic factors.",
