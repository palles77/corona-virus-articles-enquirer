The end-to-end procedure requires one to collect, manipulate, prepare, and analyze the sample. The appeal of microfluidics for this procedure is partly based on its combination of small size and its ability to process very small liquid volumes, thus minimizing the use of possibly expensive reagents. However, real-world samples are often large and incompatible with the input port and the \u03bcm-scale channels of a microfluidic device, and very small liquid volumes can be inappropriate in analyzing low concentrations of target analytes. It can be a worthy challenge to take a raw sample, introduce it into a microfluidics-based system, and perform the sample preparation, which may include separation and concentration of the target analytes, so that one can benefit from the reagentconserving small volumes and obtain the correct answer when finally implementing the assay of interest.",

These considerations drive everything \"upstream\" and greatly influence the selection of the sample(s), the processing of the sample, and the selection of assay(s) that are applied to the problem. Numerous of us who work with microfluidics-based systems have expressed optimism that some day we will have a self-powered, credit-card-sized, microfluidics-based, disposable cartridge that relatively untrained third parties can contact with a sample in some manner and, thereupon, the cartridge will transport and prepare the sample, mix it with reagents and execute other necessary sample processing steps, and then proceed to perform one or more identification-capable (ID-capable) multiplex biological assays, reporting its results for easy interpretation and action. We are not there, today, in general.",

With this implementation, no formal instrumentation is required and the colorimetric readout is performed by eye.

            "text": "Today, an Internet search returns more than 100,000 hits for \"single-molecule detection,\" so... Why hasn't the combination of microfluidics with these single-molecule assays produced a portable, \"while-you-wait\" instrument to tell you if a microbe-virus, fungus, or bacterium is causing your sore throat? With nasopharyngeal samples, aside from the Poisson statistical limits that we discussed, above, one important part of the answer is the difficulty of sample handling/sample preparation. 3 Recently, at the behest of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, my colleagues have made a survey of numerous labs across the USA that performed biodetection assays. As is discussed (Dougherty et al. 2007 ), although those who are responsible for analyzing clinical and environmental samples are basically satisfied with the performance of their reagents and assays, they would like to see improvements in the front-end procedures of sample handling and sample preparation. This echoes the previous major finding by an NRC committee on ID-capable instrumentation (Vitko Copyright 2005 , ISBN 0-309-0957X), Finding 6-1:",

            "text": "Returning to what is causing your sore throat and the task of detecting and identifying causative microbes, one important reason that microfluidic techniques have not become permanent capabilities in labs that perform IDcapable assays for respiratory pathogens is that clinical samples such as nasopharyngeal swabs have viscosity/ polymeric constituents, along with trapped air and debris, that are not immediately processible within microfluidic channels. This problem was alluded to as the \"world-to-chip\" interface (Ramsey 1999) . Also, the time-tested centrifuge is always named as something that clinical personnel would like to replace, but its replacement, if it exists, has not made the transition from research topic to laboratory workhorse. 3 Detecting and identifying pathogenic microbes in ground beef or on spinach is also a challenge, due to the combination of the low dose threshold [estimated by the US FDA to be 10 E. Coli O157:H7 bacteria USFDA, http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap15.html (Belgrader et al. 1998a; Northrup et al. 1996) Fig. 5 Dr. Michael Horseman, of Edgewood Chem-Bio Center, using the \"Handheld Advanced Nucleic-Acid Analyzer\", 2001 (Emanuel et al. 2003; Northrup et al. 1996) 9 Microfluidics and techniques for handling and preparing samples Certainly, microfluidics have utilized acoustic and electrokinetic techniques such as electroosmosis, electrophoresis, and dielectrophoresis for the transport, purification, and concentration of analytes (Wong et al. 2004) . Ultrasonics/ acoustics has effectively manipulated eukaryotic cells (Hawkes et al. 2002; Petersson et al. 2005) ; dielectrophoresis has separated bacteria from other components (Chiou et al. 2005; Pethig and Markx 1997; Yang et al. 2002) ; optoelectronic tweezers have manipulated particles (Chiou et al. 2005) ; isotachophoresis has demonstrated million-fold concentration under some circumstances (Jung et al. 2006 ). Thus, one can easily envision a series of microfluidicsbased \"virtual filters\" through which particles are separated and concentrated, according to size: ultrasonics work well with cells that are larger than 2 \u03bcm, dielectrophoresis can trap bacteria and other particles that are small enough to pass through an acoustic separator and are between 1 and 2 \u03bcm in scale, and temperature gradient focusing (Shackman et al. 2007 ), isotachophoresis (Jung et al. 2006) , and isoelectric focusing (Poitevin et al. 2007 ) may provide very fine separation and/or concentration of sub-\u03bcm constituents. For microfluidics, the promise is still very much there.",
