The complexity of the pathophysiologic response to direct or indirect lung injury in ARDS is difficult to reconstruct in experimental conditions. Thus, direct analysis of ARDS patient blood may provide valuable information. We investigated genome-wide gene expression profiles in paired whole blood samples from patients with ARDS (n 5 8) during the acute stage (within 3 d of diagnosis) and recovery stage of ARDS (around ICU discharge). Among 126 differentially expressed genes, peptidase inhibitor 3 (PI3, encoding elafin, a potent neutrophil elastase inhibitor) had the largest fold-change (23-fold changes, acute stage/recovery stage) in expression, indicating down-regulation during the acute stage of ARDS. We further examined plasma PI3 levels in 40 patients with ARDS and 23 at-risk control subjects from the same cohort. There was a coincidence of the microarray findings of lower PI3 gene expression with the lower plasma PI3 during the acute-stage. The plasma PI3 levels were statistically significant different among pre-diagnosis, day of diagnosis, and post-diagnosis groups (ANOVA, P 5 0.001), with a trend of decreasing from pre-to post-diagnosis group. The time course of plasma PI3 decrease is well correlated with the course of early ARDS development (Pearson correlation coefficient: 20.52, P 5 0.0006). Considering that PI3 can covalently binding to extracellular matrix in lung, circulating PI3 may provide a useful clinical marker for monitoring the early development of ARDS and may have implications for ARDS treatment.",

A follow-up study confirmed these findings, and suggested that particulate-induced effects on gene expression profiles are transient, with most diminishing within 18 hours after exposure, and exhibiting a dose-response pattern (unpublished data). Based on our previous experience in assessing global gene expression profiling in human blood samples, we applied a strategy of using microarray analysis to explore potential candidate genes to identify potential downstream protein products that can be used as biomarkers for ARDS. We started from an exploratory study of genome-wide gene expression in whole blood samples from patients with ARDS, with the hypothesis that there were ARDS-related differential gene expression between the acute-stage and recovery-stage of ARDS. The results of gene expression profiling were further investigated in the plasma samples from the same cohort. Since whole blood sample is a complex composition of heterogeneous cell types and its composition can be varied under different pathophysiological conditions, it is possible that the different percentages of certain subtype of blood cells between the acute stage and the recovery stage of ARDS could solely result in the observed differential expression of whole blood expression profiles. However, it is also possible that nondifferential",

The study was started in 1999, and was approved by the Human Subjects Committees of both institutions. Study subjects were recruited from patients admitted to one of the four adult intensive care units (ICU) at MGH as described previously (14, 15) . Eligible subjects were patients admitted to the ICU with at least one risk factor for the development of ARDS: (1) sepsis, (2) septic shock, (3) trauma, (4) pneumonia, (5) aspiration, or (6) massive transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBC: defined as . 8 units of PRBC during the 24 h before admission). Patients were followed prospectively during ICU for the development of ARDS. Patients who developed ARDS, defined by the American European Consensus Committee (AECC) criteria (16) , were identified as ARDS cases. Control subjects were identified as at-risk patients who did not meet criteria for ARDS during their stay in the ICU and had no prior history of ARDS. Baseline clinical information, vital signs, and laboratory testing results in the first 24 hours of ICU admission were collected for calculation of the Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score (17) . In addition to a blood collection for DNA extraction during ICU stay, plasma samples were also collected for long-term storage. Based on the original protocol, two plasma samples were collected from each recruited subject, with the first samples collected during the first 24 hours of ICU admission and the second sample collected 3 days after the first collection. A written informed consent was obtained from each subject or an appropriate proxy of the patient.",

We applied a similar paired-sampling study design in this exploratory microarray study on blood samples, with two blood samples collected from each patient with ARDS. Given the situations of uncertain timing of ARDS development in at-risk ICU patients, extreme difficulties of obtaining full collaboration from patients and medical staff during ICU, and variable courses of disease progression, it was not only extremely difficult to collect samples at exactly two arbitrarily set time points, but also practically impossible to fractionate blood cells in time without introducing extra ex vivo variations. Therefore, for the hypothesis generating purpose, we compared the difference in gene expression of whole blood total RNA samples between the acute stage of ARDS (collected within 3 d of ARDS diagnosis) and the recovery stage (collected within the 6-d period between 3 d before and 3 d after ICU discharge), even though there were large time variations between paired sample collections.",

ARDS-related gene expression changes were examined among the eight remaining pairs of RNA samples. Baseline characteristics for these subjects are shown in Table 1 .",

Quantitative RT-PCR was then performed on synthesized cDNA in triplicates on an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Of three simultaneously detected internal control genes, RPLP0 showed the lowest level of intra-assay variations, and was chosen to normalize RT-PCR results.

This unique feature of the study design enabled us to conduct a nested study of comparing plasma PI3 (pre-elafin, fully functional precursor of elafin) levels among three ARDS sample groups, including the prediagnosis group (5-d period before ARDS diagnosis), day-of-diagnosis group (within 24 h of diagnosis), and post-diagnosis group (3-d period after diagnosis), in addition to comparison between ARDS cases and at-risk control subjects. A total of 292 subjects, including 126 patients with ARDS and 166 at-risk control subjects, had plasma samples available for the analysis. We selected 40 patients with ARDS, including all 12 subjects of the pre-diagnosis group and 10 subjects of day-ofdiagnosis group, as well as 18 subjects randomly selected from the post-diagnosis group. Twenty-three at-risk control subjects were randomly selected, who had paired plasma samples with the first sample collected during the first 24 hours of ICU admission and a second sample collected 3 days later. Plasma samples were stored at 2808C until analysis. Plasma PI3 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 levels were quantified in duplicate using Human pre-ELAFIN/SKALP ELISA Test Kit (Cell Sciences, Canton, MA) and Human MMP-9 Immunoassay Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA), according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol.",

The relationship of ARDS plasma PI3 levels and the sampling date relative to ARDS diagnosis was investigated by stepwise multivariable linear regression analyses to define associated covariates, with the sampling date relative to ARDS diagnosis forced in as covariate in all models. Candidate covariates included age, sex, APACHE III score on ICU admission, history of steroid use, pre-deposit clinical complications (including sepsis, septic shock, diabetes, chronic liver disease, pneumonia, and trauma), and laboratory testing results on ICU admission (including Hematocrit, WBC counts, platelet counts, serum sodium, serum potassium, serum urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, serum glucose, serum albumin, serum bilirubin, and serum bicarbonate).

Comparisons of gene expression were performed using a straightforward approach of fold-change ranking plus a P value cutoff (,0.05), which was proved to be a more reliable ranking criterion for gene selection in previous studies (23, 24) . From a subset of 1,123 probe sets with an average paired fold-change larger than 1.2, we identified 126 genes (136 probe sets) with significantly altered gene expression. Compared to the recovery stage of ARDS, 70% (n 5 88) of genes were expressed at lower levels and 30% (n 5 38) were expressed at higher levels during the acute stage, suggesting that many genes were suppressed during the acute stage of ARDS (see Table E3 in the online supplement for complete list of genes). We also found a subset of 27 genes with large changes of expression (.1.5 fold-change) as shown in Table 2 , as compared with previous microarray analyses of whole blood paired RNA samples (13) .

Gene CYP4F3 with marginal expression change and gene MMP9 with no change were chosen as reference genes in validation. The results of gene ACTB was also illustrated, which was originally selected as endogenous control. The y-axis displays the fold change of the recovery stage to the acute stage of ARDS.",

Based on Gene Ontology annotations, the ARDSrelated gene expression changes were clustered in GO biological processes related to Response to Stimulus (GO: 50896) and Death (GO: 16265). Significant subordinate GO terms of Death Among 126 identified genes, we found that gene PI3 had the largest differential expression in peripheral blood of patients with ARDS. Expression of PI3 gene was suppressed at the early, acute stage of ARDS compared with significantly higher levels during the recovery stage of ARDS. PI3 gene encodes protein peptidase inhibitor 3 with two isoforms, including a 95amino acid molecule named pre-elafin (also known as trappin-2) and a 58-amino acid molecule called elafin, which was produced by proteolytic cleavage of pre-elafin. Both pre-elafin and elafin have two functional domains, including the C-terminal domain containing the antiproteinase active site and the N-terminal domain containing motifs of transglutaminase substrate. The transglutaminase substrate motifs, five motifs in preelafin molecules and one motif in elafin, enables covalent binding of proteinase inhibitors to the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (29) . PI3 protein expression is induced by inflammation-initiating cytokines and localized to the site of inflammatory response, including airways, skin, and other mucosal surfaces (30) (31) (32) . However, in this study, we found that the expression of PI3 gene in peripheral blood was differentially expressed between the acute stage and the recovery stage of ARDS.",

Moreover, the time course of plasma PI3 decrease was also well correlated with the course of early ARDS development, as the plasma sampling date relative to ARDS diagnosis not only shows a moderate negative correlation with plasma PI3 level (Pearson correlation coefficient: 20.52, P 5 0.0006), but also has the largest contribution in explaining the plasma PI3 variance (partial R 2 , 30.1%) in the multivariable linear regression model. Furthermore, there seems to be a pre-onset increase of the plasma PI3 level in the pre-diagnosis ARDS group (mean 193.2 pg/ml, 95% C: 124.4-262.2 pg/ml; P 5 0.01), as compared with at-risk controls within the first 24-hour ICU admission (mean 97.6 pg/ml, 95% C: 70.1-125.2 pg/ml), even though it was not reached significantly level under multiple comparison adjustment. In contrast, there was a significant but moderate increase of plasma PI3 levels during a 3-day period after ICU admission in at-risk control subjects (mean fold change of plasma PI3 level: 1.53; 95% CI, 1.28-1.78; P 5 0.0007; Figure E2 ). Taken together, these observations suggest that PI3 levels in plasma could be used as a biomarker for monitoring the development and progress of ARDS. Similarly, an earlier study reported that the serum levels of elafin could be used to monitor the disease activity of psoriasis, an inflammatory skin and joint disease (33) . The serum elafin levels were correlated with the clinical course of psoriasis and disease severity score (Psoriasis Area Severity Index), and a decrease in serum elafin levels was associated with response to cyclosporine A treatment.",

Considerable evidence exists for the role of neutrophil-derived proteinases in the pathogenesis of ARDS, including neutrophil elastase and collagenase (34) (35) (36) . A local imbalance between proteinases and their physiological inhibitors results in pulmonary parenchyma damage by leakage of a protein-rich fluid into the interstitium and alveolar spaces. Major pulmonary proteinase inhibitors include a 1 -proteinase inhibitor (a1-PI), secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI), and elafin (PI3) (32, 37) . Unlike high-molecular-weight a1-PI, which is mainly produced by the liver and reaches the lung via passive diffusion, SLPI and PI3 are low-molecular-weight inhibitors and are produced locally at neutrophil infiltration site in the lung (30) . PI3 and SLPI are important antiproteinases in the lung in both health and disease (38) , and also demonstrate multiple biological functions, such as antibacterial activity, antiinflammatory activity, priming of innate immunity, tissue remodeling and cellular differentiation, and augmentation of antiviral adaptive immunity (39) .",

In a murine model of lung injury mediated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, intratracheal administration of human elafin encoded on an adenovirus vector showed significant protection against lung injury by reduced protein concentrations in BAL fluid, increased elimination of bacteria from the airways, and decreased incidence of hematogenous bacterial dissemination (40) . In another study by Tremblay and coworkers, recombinant human pre-elafin exhibited a significant protective effect against human neutrophil elastase (HNE) induced acute lung injury in hamsters in a dose-dependent manner (41) . In contrast to preelafin, elafin did not show such a protective effect within the same study. Elafin was the proteolytic product of pre-elafin, containing less transglutaminase substrate motifs (42) . Both pre-elafin and elafin could be cross-linked to ECM protein, catalyzed by transglutaminase, and still exert anti-proteinase function (43) . However, additional transglutaminase substrate motifs contained in pre-elafin might allow stronger binding locally to inflammatory sites and show stronger protection effects than elafin.",

Although significant increases of PI3 were observed among patients with ARDS and at-risk patient without ARDS compared with healthy individuals, there was no significant difference of PI3 between patients with ARDS and at-risk patient without ARDS. In contrast, both SLPI and a1-PI demonstrated significant increases between two patient groups. Furthermore, almost all of the detectable PI3 was associated with high-molecularweight proteins, as revealed by Western blot analysis. We believe that the difference between PI3 and SLPI in BAL could be partially explained by the unique structure of transglutaminase substrate motifs contained in PI3 protein, which allows covalent binding of PI3 to ECM proteins (29, 45) . As most of PI3 is anchored to lung parenchyma and exerts its biological functions locally (44) , it may be impossible to assess accurately the protective role of PI3 in ALI or ARDS in BAL fluid or in lung tissue.",

IL-8 is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, which has been associated with ARDS in a number of previous studies. Markedly increased IL-8 level was consistently found in BAL fluid from patients with ARDS, with strong correlation to the numbers of BAL neutrophils, suggesting that IL-8 played a major role in promoting lung damage (1, (46) (47) (48) (49) . Persistent increase of BAL IL-8 level was also associated with poor clinic prognosis (50, 51) . Unlike previous studies, we found that IL8 gene expression was suppressed at the early, acute stage of ARDS, as compared with the recovery stage in this study. However, most of the previous studies mainly focused on the measurement of IL-8 levels in BAL fluid, with fewer reports including IL-8 measurements in peripheral blood in patients with ARDS. Compared with healthy control subjects, Callister and colleagues reported significant higher levels of plasma IL-8 in patients with mixed ALI/ARDS (P , 0.0001) (46) . When focusing on the early stage of ARDS development, Goodman and coworkers observed only a marginal significant increase of plasma IL-8 level in six patients (P 5 0.05) within 24 hours of post-traumatic ARDS, with a wide concentration range, than those of healthy control subjects (52) . In another study with serum IL-8 measurement in the first 24 hours of ARDS, there was no significant difference between ARDS and ALI, in contrast to significantly elevated IL-8 levels in BAL fluid in ARDS (49) . The same study also reported concentrations of IL-8 in both BAL fluid and pulmonary epithelial lining fluid were significantly higher than serum IL-8 levels in all ARDS and ALI control subjects, indicating that there was no significant correlations between pulmonary and blood IL-8 levels. Considering that many factors associated with underlying causes of ARDS could affect the plasma IL-8 levels, we did not further investigate plasma IL-8 level in the current study.",

            "text": "In this study, we were able to uniquely investigate the decrease of plasma PI3 along with the early ARDS development, specifically, from pre-to post-ARDS diagnosis. It is worth noting the drawback that the available ARDS plasma samples represented different patients, instead of ideal longitudinal samples from each patient. However, the observed decrease of plasma PI3 is not likely to be solely associated with ARDS risk factors, such as sepsis or trauma, as the regression model remained significant after adjusting for important clinic covariates of ARDS, and there were no significant differences of these risk factors between patients with ARDS and at-risk control subjects in the studied population. In addition, we only observed the coincidence of the lower PI3 gene expression and the lower plasma PI3 level during the acute stage of ARDS; additional studies are needed to address whether the variance of plasma PI3 level is merely driven by the expression change of PI3 gene in blood cells or reflects different PI3 levels in lung, or both. In conclusion, this study is the first report of the decrease of PI3 in the peripheral blood is associated with the early ARDS development, and suggests that circulating PI3 may provide a useful clinical marker for monitoring the early development of ARDS and may have significant implications for ARDS treatment.",
