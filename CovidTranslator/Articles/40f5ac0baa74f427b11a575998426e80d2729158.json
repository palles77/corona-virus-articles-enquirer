            "text": "Although they do not publicize it, pathologists have long recognized their fallibility. 1 As a result, more objective means of validating morphologic judgments have been sought. Stains using histochemical methods are of value in accentuating morphologic features but do not provide objective evidence of the lineage or biologic potential of a cell. The objective of immunohistochemistry is to use anti bodies to identify antigens, increasing the specificity of the stain for the tissue with which it reacts. In doing so, immuno histology has transformed surgical pathology from a highly subjective discipline into a much more objective science, while still taking advantage of the light microscope and standard morphologic practices. Immunohistochemistry, as the name implies, is the com bination of histology and immunology. The resulting tech nique is a powerful tool that not only enables pathologists to detect whether particular antigens are present within a given cell but also allows the identification of the micro anatomic (cellular) location of the antigen. These abilities permit the lineage of cell populations to be identified, an important consideration when confronted with a poorly differentiated neoplasm of undetermined origin. The tech nique is also useful in defining distinct populations of cells within the same lineage and defining functional differences. In addition, this technique preserves the histologic archi tecture and enables the pathologist to confirm that the positive cells are the cells in question. This confirmation is not possible with molecular methods, such as reverse tran scriptase polymerase chain reaction or standard flow cy tometry methods.",

            "text": "Immunohistochemistry has the potential to transform sur gical pathology from a subjective art to an objective science, based on the recognition of cells by microscopic methods. Although this potential has resulted in its almost universal use, immunohistochemistry has not produced uniformly high standards of practice. 3, 4 Therefore, certain technical considerations must be borne in mind to ensure the accu racy of results. It is selfevident that the quality of an immuno histochemical stain depends on the integrity of an antibodyantigen interaction and on the extent to which the relevant antigen has been preserved during tissue fixation and processing. 1 There is a high degree of variability in the way tissues are initially prepared. These variations include differences in the fixative used; the amount, age, and pH of the fixative; how long the tissue sat unfixed before being placed in fixative; the thickness of the tissue when first placed in fixative; and the time the tissue is left in fixative. All these variables, which may not alter the results of routine hematoxylineosin (H&E) staining to a significant degree, can lead to widely discrepant results when it comes to immunohistochemistry. These variables cannot always be predicted or remedied, but they can be mitigated to a great extent by the advent of successful and relatively simple antigen retrieval methods (discussed later). 5, 6 In addition to the variables in tissue fixation, as in all other laboratory tests, the reagents and techniques used must be optimized and thoroughly validated to ensure con sistent, reliable, and clinically meaningful results. When developing an immunohistochemical protocol, it is impor tant for each laboratory performing a test to validate every reagent used. This validation includes a determination of the specificity and the optimal working dilution of each primary antibody, secondary antibody, linking antibody, labeling reagent, and substrate. Repeat validation is required for each new lot of reagents because of variations in origin, composition, concentration, and specificity that can occur among different lots even when supplied by the same company. 1 Also, reputable manufacturers should be used. The higher standards and more rigorous quality control of products from the better manufacturers have been counter balanced by the concurrent proliferation of smaller manu facturers that are able to produce or otherwise acquire and market large numbers of different antibodies through mono clonal antibody technology, molecular engineering, and the like. In addition to the need for highquality antibodies and reagents, proper incubation times and ideal temperatures for each antibody must be determined. The optimal buf fering agent must be determined, as well as the need for any predigestion techniques or antigen enhancement procedures.",

Nevertheless, there are some pitfalls that should be kept in mind when working with premanufactured kits. The protocols and reagents have been formulated to work on the prototype tissue used by the manufacturer and may not be as effective on the actual tissues tested because of laboratories' different fixation and processing protocols, all of which may have adverse effects on the results. Adjustments in the recommended protocol are necessary to optimize the kits in each indi vidual laboratory, which effectively means that the kits must be customized, and any changes made in the manufacturer's protocol require that the entire staining procedure be reval idated by the performing laboratory. 1 This procedure may be complicated by the fact that many of the working dilu tions of the reagents supplied are already at the critical level of sensitivity.",

Automa tion does not mitigate the need to thoroughly validate each step of the staining procedure or the need to evaluate every reagent used to ensure highquality, consistent results. The same quality control issues that apply to manual staining apply to automated systems. As with manual staining, it is important that a complete reevaluation be performed if there is any departure from the validated protocol. 1 Auto mation does not guarantee an optimal result.

Current systems, including the Automated Cellular Imaging System II (ACIS II Clarient, Aliso Viejo, Calif), have the ability to assess marker positivity in terms of both percentage positive and intensity of staining. The ability to quantify markers more precisely is especially important in the identification of targets of therapy. One example of this is Her2/neu. When Her2/neu protein expression by immunohistochemistry was compared with gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization using routine manual methods and the assistance of a digital microscope, both accuracy and reli ability were improved when the digital microscope was used. 7,7a Precise quantification of hormone receptors may also be important because there is evidence that in patients with high levels of hormone receptors, the addition of cyto toxic chemotherapy has a deleterious effect on outcome. 8, 9 Another exciting development in the field of automated cellular imaging is spectral imaging. This technology allows multiple markers to be assessed on the same slide-even on a single cell. Computer software can isolate a single chromogen from other chromogens present based on its emission spectrum. Automated cellular imaging provides greater objectivity and reproducibility and thus minimizes interobserver discrepancies.",

Negative, weak, or unin terpretable results should lead to a repetition of the test after the use of antigen retrieval. 11, 12 One measure of antigen preservation is to test for expression of the intermediate filament vimentin, a fixationsensitive protein that is typi cally expressed by vascular or connective components; this technique often serves as an internal indicator of the con servation or loss of antigenicity. 11 Test results may also be affected by technical artifacts and by the nature of the tissue under study. For instance, if tumor cells are crushed, false positive or nonspecific staining may be encountered. Non viable areas of tissue from a necrotic tumor may also be a source of falsepositive results, attributable in part to leakage of serum proteins (e.g., immunoglobulins). The subcellular distribution of immunoreactivity is critical to the interpreta tion of immunohistochemical results. For example, Her 2/neu shows membranous staining, whereas antibodies to estrogen and progesterone receptors produce nuclear stain ing. When unexpected staining patterns are observed with an antibody, the results should be discounted. 1 To interpret the results effectively, the pathologist must have extensive knowledge of the staining patterns of the primary antibod ies under consideration, including a detailed knowledge of tissue specificity and subcellular localization of the antigen, and an awareness of technical variables. Each lab oratory performing immunohistochemical staining should have established written criteria for determining and report ing positive and negative findings for each immunohisto chemical stain, with particular reference to stains that are expected to produce cell surface membrane, cytoplasmic nuclear, or extracellular staining. Although it seems obvious, it often is overlooked that staining should be recorded as positive only if it occurs in the expected cellular or tissue location.",

This crosslinking interferes with the antigen's ability to react with the primary antibody. In 1991 the antigen retrieval technique was developed. 12, 18 This technique is a heatinduced modification of the protein con formation that allows the antigen to be accessible again for chemical reactions, in this case, antibody binding. Hydrolysis of crosslinking resulting from formalin fixation probably plays a major role in this modification process. 1922 The application of antigen retrieval to sections derived from formalinfixed, paraffinembedded blocks produces consistent results of acceptable quality, 6 although a few anti gens remain undetectable even after antigen retrieval has been performed. Antigen retrieval methods have revolution ized immunohistochemistry and have become a standard part of diagnostic immunohistochemistry in surgical pathol ogy. These methods result in higher sensitivity and more consistent antibody reactivity. Antigen retrieval technology has led to a proliferation of protocols that may produce different results in different laboratories. The successful application of these methods allows the detection of some antigens that were previously undetectable in paraffin sec tions, rendering much of the early literature (prior to 1993) obsolete. This fact continues to escape the notice of some practicing pathologists, leading to errors of interpretation (Fig. 51) .",

Based on these two factors (heating conditions and buffer pH), a test battery approach has been developed to establish optimal antigen retrieval protocols for immunostaining on archival paraffinembedded tissue sections. 1, 6, 23 A typical test battery consists of nine serial sections of a specimen known to express the antigen under study. The sections are evaluated with buffer at three different pH values (e.g., pH 1 to 2, 7 to 8, and 10 to 11) and three heating conditions (e.g., 90\u00b0C, 100\u00b0C, and 120\u00b0C) for various lengths of time (or some other comparable heating versus time schedule). The best result is selected as the optimal retrieval condition for that antigen. In the event that a satisfactory result is not obtained, other variations may be explored, including dif ferent buffer solutions and more or less vigorous heating methods. 19, 23 Protocols for antigen retrieval differ in their effectiveness for retrieving certain antigens, and a single universally effective retrieval method does not exist. Many laboratories use more than one method for different anti body and antigen combinations. Overall, citrate buffer at pH 6.0 has the broadest applicability for the widest range of antigens, although several studies have demonstrated that the use of higher pH retrieval solutions yields satisfac tory results. 21, 24 Retrieval solutions with lower pH values, TRIS (tromethamine) buffer at pH 8.0, and EDTA (ethyl enediaminetetraacetic acid)NaOH solution (pH 8.0), are effective in certain special situations. 2527 The selection of heating method (water bath, steamer, microwave, pres sure cooker, or autoclave) is influenced by custom and availability.",

It is well recognized that morphologic features often overlap among different entities and that one disease can present with myriad histologic pictures. Most tumors can be classified correctly by routine histologic techniques when the clinical situation is clear (e.g., a breast mass); however, an important subset of tumors defies morphologic interpretation. The magnitude of this problem is substantial. The diagnosis of \"metastatic cancer of unknown primary site\" is the eighth most common cancer diagnosis and may represent up to 15% of cancers at large hospitals. 28 Much more common is the diagnosis of \"tumor of uncertain origin.\" This occurs when (1) the tumor is first identified in a metastatic site, and the primary site is not apparent; (2) the tumor is so poorly differentiated that no specific morphologic features can be identified; (3) the morphologic appearance of the tumor is compatible with more than one distinct tissue (e.g., epithelial versus lymphoid origin); and (4) the histogenesis of a tumor is clear (e.g., adenocarcinoma), but the primary site is in ques tion.

In a generic sense, malignant cells expressing keratin positivity indicate an epithelial origin. Antibodies against keratin are also extremely useful as markers for occult metastases (micro metastases) in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes (discussed later). There are more than 20 different subtypes of cytokeratin found in human epithelial cells. These subtypes are distin guishable by their molecular weight and isoelectric pH. 31 Monoclonal antibodies specific for many of these subtypes have been developed. Carcinomas of different types tend to express characteristic keratin profiles. 32 There is a general correlation between the complexity of the epithelium from which the tumor is derived and the complexity of the keratin subunits expressed. Lowmolecularweight or non squamous keratins appear early in development and pre dominate in tumors derived from simple, nonstratified epithelium (e.g., ductal carcinoma of the breast, gastroin testinal adenocarcinoma). Highmolecularweight or squa mous keratins appear in more complex stratified epithelium and predominate in tumors derived from stratified epithe lium (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma). Some tumors, such as those derived from pseudostratified columnar epithe lium, contain a mixture of high and lowmolecularweight keratins, with a predominance of the latter. In some instances, especially in extremely poorly differentiated tumors, as few as 5% of tumor cells may express keratin reactivity. 1 When a tumor of uncertain primary site has been defined as epithelial by either immunohistochemistry or morphol ogy, it is important to attempt to define its specific origin. This presents a problem when, for example, a patient with a prior history of breast carcinoma presents with a lung mass that, on biopsy, is adenocarcinoma. Determining whether the lung mass represents a primary pulmonary tumor or metastasis from the breast has enormous conse quences in terms of patient outcome and choice of specific treatment. Although the immunohistochemical evaluation of primary epithelial tumors is problematic, advances have been made. Monoclonal antibodies against keratin subtypes may help determine the origin of certain poorly differenti ated neoplasms. Hepatocellular carcinoma (positive for AE3 and CAM 5.2 but negative for AE1) can be distinguished from bile duct carcinoma and adenocarcinoma metastatic to the liver (positive for AE1). 33 In particular, the differential expression of cytokeratins 7 and 20 (CK7, CK20) is extremely useful in the characterization of epithelial neo plasms (Fig. 53) . 32,3436 These patterns are not absolute, but they can be useful guides in establishing origin.",

CK5/6 has been found to be positive in the majority of squamous cell carcinomas, basal cell carci nomas, thymomas, salivary gland tumors, and biphasic malignant mesotheliomas and in a subset of endometrial adenocarcinomas, transitional cell carcinomas, and pancre atic adenocarcinomas. 37 CK5/6 is rarely positive in adeno carcinoma of the lung and has therefore been used to distinguish malignant mesothelioma from pulmonary ade nocarcinoma. 37,38 In addition, p63 is frequently seen in squamous cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma, whereas mesothelioma is uniformly negative for p63. There fore, positive immunostaining for both p63 and CK5/6 is highly predictive of a primary tumor of squamous epithelial origin. 39,40 Because p63 is also known to immunoreact on the basal cell nuclei in benign prostate glands, this marker can be used to distinguish prostate cancer from benign mimics. 41 There is an increasing array of tissue-specific markers, such as prostatespecific antigen (PSA) and thyroglobulin, as well as tissue-associated markers, such as GCDFP15 and mammaglobin for breast epithelium, 42,43 OC125 for ovary, 44 uroplakins for urothelium, 45,46 and synaptophysin for neuroendocrine lesions (Fig. 54) . 47 Table 52 summarizes many of these tissueassociated antibodies. It is important to keep in mind patterns of antigenic coexpression, which can lead to erroneous assessments. Also, as mentioned earlier, the more poorly differentiated the neoplasm, the less likely it is to express tissuespecific or associated antigens. Nevertheless, the specific origin of an epithelial neoplasm of uncertain primary site can be elucidated in an increasing proportion of cases through careful evaluation of morphol ogy, clinical data, and antigen expression.",

In addition, the success of adju vant therapy is assumed to stem from its ability to eradicate occult metastases before they become clinically evident. 99 Immunohistochemistry is commonly used to identify occult metastatic cancer cells in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and lymph nodes of patients with cancer. Although many of the initial studies focused on breast cancer, 100102 tumors from other organs such as the stomach, 103, 104 colon, 105, 106 prostate, 107,108 lung, 109,110 nervous system, 111 and skin 112 have been investigated. Immunohistochemical methods are based on the ability of monoclonal antibodies to distinguish between cells of different histogenesis (e.g., epithelial cancer cells versus the hematopoietic and stromal cells of the bone marrow and lymph nodes). The results indicate that it is possible to identify occult metastatic cancer cells in lymph nodes and bone marrow before their detection by other methods and that the presence of these cells may be an important risk factor for disease recurrence (Fig. 58) .",

These antibodies do not react with normal hematopoietic or stromal cells present in the bone marrow or lymph nodes. None of the antibodies used in any study is specific for cancer; all react with normal and malignant epithelial cells. They are useful because they can identify an extrinsic population of epithelial cells in bone marrow or lymph nodes, where there are normally no epi thelial elements. The reported sensitivity of immunohisto chemistry ranges from the detection of 1 epithelial cell in 10,000 to 2 to 5 epithelial cells in 1 million hematopoietic cells. 100, 113 A potentially more sensitive approach for the detection of occult metastasis is the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) technique, which has been applied to several malignancies using a variety of marker transcripts as targets. Since the first study by Smith and colleagues in 1991, 114 many authors have reported molecular diagnoses in the lymph nodes, blood, and bone marrow in cancer patients. 42,107,115119 Application of RTPCR in regional and sentinel lymph nodes has been described for a number of cancers, including melanoma, colorectal cancer, and cancers of the prostate, breast, and lung. 118, 120124 Many of these compare immunocytochemicalbased detection with RT PCR for sensitivity and conclude that RTPCR may achieve enhanced detection, provided the target markers are suffi ciently specific. Various formats of RTPCR assays 125127 have also been used to detect disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow of patients with cancers of the breast, colon, and lung, among others. With the exception of some organ specific markers such as maspin or mammaglobin for breast cancer 116, 128 or uroplakins for urothelial tumors, 129 most of the molecular targets used in these RTPCR assays lack the requisite specificity owing to illegitimate expression in nontarget hematopoietic cells. 130132 Unlike immunohisto chemistry, morphologic confirmation of the cells in ques tion to verify tumor origin is not possible with RTPCR. RTPCR has also been used to enhance the sensitivity of the detection of tumor cells in the peripheral blood in a variety of cancers, including prostate, breast, gastrointesti nal tract, colorectal, and head and neck cancers and mela noma. 117, 133135 Concerns about nonspecificity owing to illegitimate transcription of target genes in the nontarget hematopoietic cells also apply to the blood, which has ham pered the use of these assays in routine clinical diagnosis.",

            "text": "Studies undertaken to detect occult lymph node metastases by routine histologic methods have generally been per formed by cutting serial sections from all paraffin blocks containing lymph nodes, followed by routine staining and microscopic review. 163 Several studies simply reviewed the original histologic slides. Newer studies involve cytokeratin immunohistochemistry on one or more lymph node sec tions. PSA immunohistochemistry has also been used to confirm the prostatic origin of cytokeratinpositive cells in the lymph nodes of patients with prostate cancer. 108 All these studies have shown that deposits of tumor can be detected using these methods. In previously determined nodenegative cases of breast cancer, 7% to 33% convert to nodepositive status after review. Neville and colleagues 164 found the mean conversion rate to be approximately 13%. Although virtually all studies have shown that lymph node metastases can be overlooked, there has been surprising disagreement about the prognostic importance of these occult tumor deposits. 165167 However, it is now widely accepted that the detection of occult lymph node metastases is an important predictor of outcome in patients with histologically nodenegative cancer. 168170 In a key study (Ludwig Trial V), occult breast cancer metastases were detected by immunohistochemistry in 20% of patients and were associated with significantly poor diseasefree and overall survival in postmenopausal patients but not in pre menopausal patients. 168 Additional studies in patients with breast cancer found occult lymph node metastases to be predictive of a poorer outcome. 169, 170 Studies in patients with lung, 171,172 prostate, 107,108 and colorectal 173, 174 cancer suggest that occult metastases in the lymph nodes in these patients may also predict a worse prognosis. The finding that occult bone marrow and lymph node metastases are prognostically important has motivated several major clinical trials, notably by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group, in breast cancer (Z0010) and lung cancer (Z0040). The advent of the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy in tumor surgery (for breast cancer and melanoma) has caused physicians to examine these lymph nodes by more sensitive techniques, owing to the limited material available for histologic review. 175 It is likely that the detection of occult metastases will soon be the general stan dard of care; this is true at many institutions that treat large numbers of patients with cancer.",

Her2/neu overex pression occurs in 10% to 34% of primary breast carcino mas 187 and is restricted to cancer cells.

Its normal func tion is to prevent the replication of damaged DNA; it does so by preventing cell replication by binding and inhibiting the transcription factor E2F. 209, 210 The retinoblastoma protein (pRb) is activated when it is dephosphorylated and inacti vated when it is phosphorylated. Alterations in this gene have been described in many human tumors, including retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma, other sarcomas, leukemias, lymphomas, and certain carcinomas, including breast, lung, prostate, bladder, kidney, and testicular carcinoma. 29, 211, 212 Gene alterations are associated with advanced tumor grade and stage in a variety of tumors. 211, 213 Alterations in the Rb gene correlate with loss of expression of pRb as determined by immunohistochemistry. 214 Assessment of Rb gene loss by immunohistochemistry is based on the loss of detectable nuclear staining for pRb. There is growing evidence that gene alterations may identify tumors that have a higher risk of developing metastases. 215 Loss of heterozygosity, muta tions, or deletions of the Rb gene usually result in the loss of pRb expression, which has been regarded as an indicator of loss of pRb function in human tumors. In addition to loss of pRb expression, aberrantly high pRb expression indi cates a loss of pRb function in bladder tumors compared with moderate pRb expression. 210, 215 It has been shown that tumors with pRb overexpression demonstrate pRb hyper phosphorylation, mediated in part by the loss of p16 expres sion or overexpression of cyclin D1. 210",

The traditional means of determining appropriate systemic treatment generally involved histo genic classification. It has long been recognized, however, that response to hormonal therapy can be predicted spe cifically by molecular determinants (e.g., the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in breast and other cancers of reproductive organs). 244 Tumors arising from the breast, prostate, endometrium, and ovary are known to be regulated by steroid sex hor mones (estrogens, androgens). It was discovered that removing the source of hormones that control tumor growth (by oophorectomy, orchiectomy, or chemical methods) sometimes resulted in dramatic tumor remission. 244 Growth regulation was found to be associated with the amount of specific hormone receptors: Tumors that expressed high levels of these receptors tended to respond well to hormone ablation, whereas those with few or no receptors tended not to respond to this type of therapy. Accurate methods for determining the presence or absence of hormone recep tors are essential for determining the best method of treatment.",

These immunohistochemical methods can be performed on formalinfixed, paraffin embedded tissue and on cytology specimens. Immunohis tochemical antireceptor assays allow one to predict breast cancer's response to hormonal treatment. 245, 246 Tumors that do not express estrogen or progesterone receptors have a low probability of responding to hormonal manipulation, whereas estrogen receptor-and progesterone receptor-pos itive tumors have a high probability of responding to such treatment. Many practitioners believe that the only relevant result for hormone receptors in breast cancer is \"positive\" or \"negative.\" However, some investigators have shown that the level of hormone receptor is important as well. 8, 9 Although a proportion of patients with low levels of hormone receptor will respond to hormone therapy, most benefit from the addition of systemic cytotoxic chemother apy. In contrast, in patients with high levels of hormone receptor, the addition of cytotoxic chemotherapy has a del eterious effect on outcome. 8, 9 Recently, attention has focused on expression of the estrogen receptor subtypes \u03b1 and \u03b2 and on various isoforms of the \u03b2 subtype. It has been found that estrogen receptor \u03b1-negative tumors express significant levels of estrogen receptor \u03b21 and \u03b25 and that their expression levels are no different from levels in estrogen receptor \u03b1-positive tumors. 246 Therefore, these two estrogen receptor isoforms may be potential molecular targets for designing chemopre ventive drugs to treat estrogen receptor \u03b1-negative breast cancers.",

Pglycoprotein also may play a role in tumor progression and has been associated with blood vessel invasion and lymph node metastases. 2 Some tumors inherently express Pglycoprotein, whereas other tumors acquire expression only after exposure to certain chemotherapeutic agents. 2 Overexpression is associ ated with failure of chemotherapy. 2, 247 Other predictors of response to specific forms of chemo therapy are being explored. The prevailing view has been that p53 alterations should result in a chemoresistant phe notype. This view is based on a body of evidence showing that wildtype p53 is required for entrance into the apop totic pathway at the G 1 to Sphase transition. 248, 249 Because chemotherapy works through the induction of apoptosis, p53 alterations may result in resistance to such agents. We are conducting a clinical trial concerning the role of p53 in predicting progression and response in patients with bladder cancer. 250 It is also possible that p53 may promote chemo resistance by other mechanisms, such as through induction of the multidrug resistance (MDR-1) gene. 249, 251 In tumors in which p53 alterations confer increased (selective) che mosensitivity, combining agents that have different actions (e.g., DNA damage versus inhibition of the G 2 M check point) may have synergistic effects on tumor cell killing, a finding that has important implications in the design of new combination chemotherapy regimens. 252 The expression of thymidylate synthase in colorectal tumors predicts resistance to the most common type of systemic chemotherapy used in that disease, 5fluoroura cil. 253, 254 As mentioned earlier, Her2/neu overexpression in breast cancer predicts resistance to hormone therapy in estrogen receptor-positive tumors 189, 190, 255 and resistance to some types of chemotherapy, but increased sensitivity to doxorubicinbased regimens. 193, 194 Her2/neu and EGFR are specific targets of antibodydirected therapy. In the case of Her 2/neu, it seems that only those tumors that overexpress the target are likely to respond to such therapies. 256258 In the case of colorectal cancer, therapy directed against EGFR appears to work only in tumors with wildtype KRAS; tumors with mutant KRAS do not respond to EGFR therapy. 258a Similar findings are seen in lung cancer. 258b The ability to predict the specific response of individual tumors to chemotherapeutic agents can have a profound effect on treatment decisions for patients with cancer. It is not difficult to envision the day when drug selection is based on the resistance patterns of individual tumors to specific agents. Treatment decisions will become less organ based and will better reflect the biology of the tumors.",
