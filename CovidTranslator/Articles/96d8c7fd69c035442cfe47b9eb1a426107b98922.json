Most molecular modeling studies of cysteine proteases refer to this paradigm as their starting point. Nevertheless, several recent kinetics and X-ray crystallography studies of viral and bacterial cysteine proteases depart from the ion-pair mechanism, suggesting general base catalysis. We challenge the postulate of the ion-pair formation in free papain. Applying our QM/SCRF(VS) molecular modeling approach, we analyzed all protonation states of the catalytic diad in free papain and its SMe derivative, comparing the predicted and experimental pK a data. We conclude that the His -Cys catalytic diad in free papain is fully protonated, NH(+)/SH. The experimental pK a =8.62 of His159 imidazole in free papain, obtained by NMR controlled titratin and originally interpreated as the NH(+)/S(\u2212) \u21cc N/S(\u2212) equilibrium, is now assigned to the NH(+)/SH \u21cc N/SH equilibrium.",

They are thought to be present as a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair (Cys25)-S \u2212 /(His159)-Im + H (papain numbering) in the free enzyme (FE).1 -3 The thiolate anion in catalytically active free enzyme is prepared for nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl carbon of the scissile amide or ester bond. The His-Im + H functions as a general acid, facilitating the living group departure from the tetrahedral intermediate to produce an acyl enzyme intermediate. This widely accepted mechanistic paradigm, pioneered by Polgar and coworkers, was based on pH-dependence of the second-order rate constants of inactivation of papain and thiosubtilisin.4 -6 The acidic pK a = 4 was assigned to the (Cys25)-SH/(His159)-Im + H \u21cc (Cys25)-S \u2212 /(His159)-Im + H equilibrium, and the basic pK a = 8.4 was assigned to the (Cys25)-S \u2212 /(His159)-Im + H \u21cc (Cys25)-S \u2212 /(His159)-Im equilibrium. This reversed order of pK a (Cys) < pK a (His) in the ion pair, compaired with 6.04 for histidine and 8.37 for cysteine in solution,7 was interpreted to reflect mutual electrostatic stabilization of the counter ions in the thiolate-imidazolium ion pair.1 -3 Fluorescence spectroscopy8 and NMR9 , 10 titration experiments of free papain and its SSMe derivative, in which the Cys25 thiol was blocked by methylthiolation, further supported this interpretation. The pK a = 8.62 of free papain was assigned to histidine deprotonation from the ion-pair state. When the electrostatic influence of the thiolate anion was eliminated by the bound SMe, His pK a was decreased to 3.39.",

All water exposed groups ionized at pH 7 (Asp, Glu, Lys and Arg) were neutralized to avoid an overestimation of ionic interactions in vacuum caused by the absence of screening water molecules and counterions. The Cys25 and His159 catalytic groups were examined in both protonated and deprotonated states. The position of the SSMe group was refined by conformational analysis on three torsional angles corresponding to rotations around C \u03b1 -C \u03b2 , C \u03b2 -S and S-S single bonds, applying 200 steps of random changes in torsional angles by MCMM algorithm47 , 48 implemented in the Macromodel package.

In the QM/SCRF(VS) approach QM explicitly accounts for the preorganized local polar environment in the enzyme active site influencing recharging of the ionizable groups in the Cys/His catalytic diad. Thus, our model FE and SSMe molecular clusters include the Cys25 and His159 residues in their basic (B) and acidic (A) forms, as well as residues associated with them by a net of hydrogen bonds in the active site.

Q(A) and Q(B) are the total charges of the spherical solute cavity of radius a in \u00c5, when the target ionizable functional group is in the acidic (A) or the basic (B) form, respectively. Eq. 5 rationalizes the dependence of pK a not only on the active site permanent dipoles (\u0394G g (AS) in the second term), but also on the partial water solvation accounted for in the first term. The first term in Eq. 5 is the approximation of the rigorously calculated (by DFT) \u0394G vs (AS) in Eq. 3. Being a combination of two functions, \u03b5 eff (SASA) and (Q 2 (B) \u2212 Q 2 (A)), the first term of Eq. 5 accounts for the combined influence of two environmental factors on pK a : the degree of water exposure of the target catalytic residue, \u03b5 eff (SASA); and the dependence of the free energy of solvation on the change of the total number of the ionized groups in the enzyme active site caused by the recharging of the target catalytic group during deprotonation. Eq. 5 enables prediction (used for the interpretations purpose only, but not for quantitative calculations) of the trend of pK a changes by knowing the value of Q 2 (B) \u2212 Q 2 (A) in the active site. If Q 2 (A) > Q 2 (B), pK a shifts in parallel to the change in \u03b5 eff or \u03b8, while if Q 2 (A) < Q 2 (B), a decrease in \u03b8 or \u03b5 eff will lead to increase in pK a . 35 , 40 Examining Table II and the corresponding protonation states (Figure 1 ) of the basic and acidic forms of the QM molecular clusters shows that the former trend applies to pK a (1), pK a (2) , and pK a (5) (Q 2 (B) \u2212 Q 2 (A) = 0 \u2212 1= \u22121), while the latter is represented by pK a (3) and pK a (4) (Q 2 (B) \u2212 Q 2 (A) = 1 \u2212 0 = 1).",

These could be resolved by comparison of FE with its SMe derivative. The SMe group on Cys25 in the papain derivative screens the His159 imidazole from solvent. The time-averaged values of the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) collected on the MD trajectories are 11.13 \u00c5 2 in FE, and only 0.038 \u00c5 2 in the SMe derivative ( Figure 6) . The experimental pK a = 3.5 of His159 in SSMe at 25\u00b0C (recalculated from the measured value of 3.39 at 35\u00b0C 9 ) was reproduced for the theoretical pK a (5) at \u03b5 eff = 4.5. Thus, accepting the pK a (2) equilibrium, reached at \u03b5 eff = 3.5, would indicate that the water exposure of His159 in free enzyme is smaller than in the SMe derivative, in contradiction to the above MD results. On the other hand, pK a (1) in FE fits the experimental pK a value at \u03b5 eff \u2265 40, a value which is much larger than that identified for SSMe, in agreement with our theoretical findings that \u03b5 eff is a measure of the SASA of the ionizable group used for the calibration.35",

Indeed, the calculated gas-phase \u0394G g (AS) = 343.1 kcal/mol corresponding to Cys pK a (3) is smaller than 348.9 kcal/mol, the analogous experimental gas-phase basicity of ethylmercaptane (Table I) . The smaller value of \u0394G g (AS) reflects the stabilization effect by neighboring polar groups of the thiolate anion of Cys in the enzyme active site. pK a (3) = 17.8 at \u03b5 = 40 is also not surprising. According to the MD simulations ( Figure 4 ) the Cys thiolate in free papain is partially water solvated, forming several hydrogen bonds with water molecules. This observation correlates with QM/MM findings.34 Nevertheless, the partial water solvation of the catalytic Cys thiolate in free papain is considerably smaller than in the case of a surface cysteine residue or small molecules fully solvated in water. In addition there are no positively charged neighboring groups in the active site of free papain that could stabilize the Cys thiolate of the catalytic diad in the N/S(\u2212) state.",

We would like to note in this context that we have previously calculated pK a = 11.5, and the corresponding \u0394G g (AS) = 327.8 kcal/mol for the catalytic His195 in the modelling of enzyme-inhibitor covalent anionic tetrahedral complex in serine proteases, in very good agreement with the experimental value of pK a = 11.2 recalculated to 25\u00b0C. 35 Thus the value of \u0394G g (AS) = 330 kcal/mol in the present study is very reasonable.",

We suggest that papain-like cysteine proteases become active only upon substrate binding. The latter event reduces the water exposure of the catalytic diad in the Michaelis complex (MC) and thus triggers the enzymatic catalysis.35 Indeed, according to Eq. 5 the pK a change in the FE \u2192 MC transformation is characterized by the Q 2 (B) \u2212 Q 2 (A) = 0 \u2212 1= \u22121 trend, if FE is initially in the NH(+)/SH protonation state as found in this work. Thus, two possible protonation states could be realized in the MC: N/SH or NH(+)/S(\u2212). The latter is the ion pair, in which the thiolate is ready for the nucleophilic attack and the His imidazolium can activate the scissile amide by general acid catalysis. If N/SH is initially formed in the Michaelis complex, an alternative mechanism is feasible, in which the SH proton is transferred to the catalytic His concurrently with the nucleophilic attack of the S atom on the substrate. This mechanism is analogous to the corresponding catalytic mechanism of serine proteases.",

We demonstrated that the pK a values of catalytic residues are controlled by the cooperative effect of the active site polar local environment (pre-oriented dipoles) and the free energy of solvation of the partially water exposed target catalytic group in the active site. Based on our modeling simulations of all possible protonation states of the catalytic diad, calculated vs. experimental pK a 's, we suggest a novel structure to the catalytic Cys25-His159 diad in free papain at neutral pH, in which both residues are protonated, rather than in the ion pair paradigm. The experimental pK a 8.62 in free papain is now assigned to the equilibrium NH(+)/SH \u21cc N/SH. 1 H NMR chemical shift calculations demonstrated that the experimental CH \u03b5 proton chemical shifts cannot differentiate between the two equilibria NH(+)/SH \u21cc N/SH and NH(+)/S(\u2212) \u21cc N/S(\u21cc), and therefore cannot support the ion pair paradigm. Thus, it is very difficult to provide definitive experimental data for the protonation state of the Cys-His catalytic diad in free cysteine proteases. One possible solution could be very high resolution X-ray crystallography of free papain, in which protons position could be identified. Such high resolution 3D structures of serine proteases with proton positioning were previously determined for serine proteases.68 , 69 Further application of the QM/SCRF(VS) approach to study the cysteine proteases mechanism is now underway.

The empirical coefficients a = 0.8102 and b = 1.4896 were previously calibrated by linear regression analysis used for the correlation of experimental vs. theoretical chemical shifts of all protons in pyridine and imidazole in both basic and acidic forms. All NMR calculations were done in the B3LYP/6-31+G** level of theory. Experimental values of imidazole and pyridine chemical shifts were determined in our lab at 25\u00b0C in water solution.",
