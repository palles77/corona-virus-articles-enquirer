A set of four primers were designed based on the conservative sequence of coding F5 fimbriae. Temperature and time condition, specificity test, and sensitivity test were performed with the DNA of Escherichia coli (F5?). The results showed that the optimal reaction condition for LAMP was achieved at 61\u00b0C for 45 min in a water bath. Ladder-like products were produced with those F5-positive samples by LAMP, while no product was generated with other negative samples. The assay of LAMP had a detection limit equivalent to 72 cfu/tube, which was more sensitive than PCR (7.2 9 10 2 cfu/tube). The agreement rate between LAMP and PCR was 100 % in detecting simulation samples. Thus, the LAMP assay may be a new method for rapid detection of F5 fimbriae gene of ETEC.",

            "text": "Adhesion fimbria play an important role in causing young animal diarrhea by Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), it enables ETEC to colonize the small intestinal cell surface, and ETEC produce toxins to cause the host diarrhea [1] . The fimbrial adhesions most frequently diagnosed in ETEC strains isolated from piglets with diarrhea are F4(K88), F5(K99), F6(987P), and F41 [14] , which have different antigenicity. Thus, vaccines developed from one specific fimbria could not provide protection against an ETEC strain expressing a different fimbria. Therefore, it is necessary to detect fimbriae's type of ETEC-isolated strains and to select an appropriate vaccine prepared with right fimbriae antigen. The type of fimbriae is determined by the genes encoding fimbriae protein, thus detection of the genes encoding fimbriae protein can determine the type that the fimbriae has expressed. F5 fimbriae is one of the most common fimbriae antigen, it was established as a transmissible K antigen with adhesive properties in 1975 [17] and encoded on a 58-megadalton plasmid [8] .",

It is easy to perform, can get a lot of specific amplification products at a constant temperature without the need for complex equipment, and the amplification reaction result can be visually determined by turbidity or by adding dye [10] . LAMP has also been used widely for the detection of pathogens [2, 7, 20, 21] , but determining results by turbidity requires expensive equipment; thus it is not suitable for small-scale laboratory. In our lab, we added SYBR Green I in the reaction product, E. coli has a large-scale bacterial genome, about 4 million base pairs, and some sequences are not published in GenBank. Therefore, LAMP primers designed with known genome may result in false positive if they bind on some unknown genome. To guarantee primers' specificity, we appointed upper PCR primer of F5 fimbriae to F2 in FIP of LAMP primers [3] , then designed following primers online, thus it reduced workload of detecting primers' specificity. In a LAMP reaction, inner primer F2 in FIP hybridizes to F2c in the target DNA and initiates complementary strand synthesis at first. Outer primer F3 slowly hybridizes to F3c in the target DNA and initiates strand displacement DNA synthesis, releasing a FIP-linked complementary strand, which can form a looped out structure at one end. This single-stranded DNA serves as template for BIP-initiated DNA synthesis and subsequent B3-primed strand displacement DNA synthesis, leading to the production of a dumb-bell form DNA, which is quickly converted to a stem-loop DNA by self-primed DNA synthesis [10] . So, F2 in FIP and B2 in BIP first combined with target DNA in a reaction, their specificity have a direct effect on the reaction.",

It mediates ETEC to colonize the small intestinal cell surface and then ETEC produce toxins to cause the host diarrhea; thus, many vaccines about this used fimbriae as the immunogen. Crouch, vaccinated cows with a combined vaccine against rotavirus, coronavirus and E. coli F5 (K99). There was a significant increase in the mean specific antibody titer against all three antigens in the serum of the vaccinated animals which was accompanied by increased levels of protective antibodies to rotavirus, coronavirus, and E. coli F5 (K99) in their colostrums and milk [4] . Rising [13] experiments showed that sows vaccinated with a vaccine against neonatal E. coli diarrhea in piglets containing purified F4ab, F4ac, F5, and F6 fimbriae and detoxified heat-labile toxin (LT) can make an effective protection of piglets against neonatal E. coli diarrhea. Rapid detection and identification of fimbriae's type of ETEC strains isolated from animals with diarrhea contribute to select an appropriate vaccine prepared with right fimbriae antigen for improving the immune protective effect, also contribute for epidemiological survey more convenient. So, we can identify the fimbriae type of ETEC that caused young animals' diarrhea, and we can make prevention and treatment against ETEC diarrhea in the more targeted region [9] . ETEC also causes diarrhea in humans, and the major virulence factors of ETEC strains in humans include colonization factor antigens (CFA) and toxins. Some studies suggest that up to 70 % of strains that cause diarrhea in humans express CFA/I, CFA/II, or CFA/ IV [12, 15, 19] , detection of the fimbriae type is also significant to choose or prepare an appropriate fimbriae vaccine. This study indicates that the LAMP is sensitive, specific, and rapid for detecting F5 fimbriae gene, and the LAMP assay have avoided low specificity, cumbersome operation, special and expensive instruments, and other shortcomings of conventional methods in detecting fimbriae gene. CFA of the ETEC strains in humans may also be detected by LAMP assay.",
