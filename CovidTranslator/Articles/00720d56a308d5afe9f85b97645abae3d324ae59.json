            "text": "A total of ten infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates collected from commercial chickens in Italy in 1999 were characterized by RT-PCR and sequencing of the S1 and N genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial S1 gene sequences showed that five field viruses clustered together with 793/B-type strains, having 91.3-98.5% nucleotide identity within the group, and one isolate had very close sequence relationship (94.6% identity) with 624/I strain. These two IBV types have been identified in Italy previously. The other three variant isolates formed novel genotype detected recently in many countries of Western Europe. For one of these variant viruses, Italy-02, which afterwards became the prototype strain, the entire S1 gene was sequenced to confirm its originality. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of more conserved partial N gene sequences, comprising 1-300 nucleotides, revealed different clustering. Thus, three variant IBVs of novel Italy-02 genotype, which had 96.7-99.2% S1 gene nucleotide identity with each other, belonged to three separate subgroups based on N gene sequences. 624/I-type isolate Italy-06 together with Italy-03, which was undetectable using S1 gene primers, shared 97.7% and 99.3% identity, respectively, in N gene region with vaccine strain H120. Only one of the 793/B-type isolates, Italy-10, clustered with the 793/B strain sharing 99.3% partial N gene identity, whereas the other four isolates were genetically distant from them (only 87.7-89.7% identity) and formed separate homogenous subgroup. The results demonstrated that both mutations and recombination events could contribute to the genetic diversity of the Italian isolates.",

Epizootological situation on IBV in Italy is not an exception. For the last three decades, at least 10 antigenically different isolates have been detected in Italy [14, 15] . While most of them had a transient appearance, some serotypes (e.g., Massachusetts [Mass] and AZ 23/74) have been isolated for a long period in many regions. Serological and molecular analysis of IBV field strains from Italy isolated in 1997 have shown the co-existence of four virus types (793/B, 624/I, B1648 and Mass) identified also in other European countries [16] . Partial S1 gene sequence analysis of 624/I strain, first detected in Italy in 1993 [17] , confirmed that this virus was a novel IBV genotype. The results of the surveillance program undertaken lately in Italy have indicated the co-circulation of three types of IBV [18] . Using RT-PCR and partial sequencing of the S1 gene, 7 isolates were identified as of 793/B type, 2 isolates were closely related to previously undetected in Europe Chinese QXIBV strain, and the other 8 IBVs were of newly emerged Italy-02 genotype. Since this genotype is currently one of the dominant types of IBV in Western Europe [19] it has been recently characterized both antigenically and phylogenetically (S1 gene analysis) by the example of Spanish isolates and has been shown to be a new IBV serotype [20] .",

Since field situation has significantly changed for the last decade and only one of four IBV types (793/B), detected in 1997, has persisted recently together with two new types (Italy-02 and QXIBV), it was of interest to analyze when these variants could emerge.

IBV S1 gene is used very often to assess the genetic diversity and evolution direction of IBV due to its high variability and sequence correlation with serological grouping [20, 26] . The phylogenetic analysis based on N gene sequences does not always follow the clustering based on S1 gene [25] . However, the comparison of N gene sequences coupled with S1, is also very useful tool for evolutionary analysis, allowing to find out recombinant viruses since regions between S1 and N genes are involved in recombination [27, 28] . The S1 primer set was used previously for testing field samples in Russia and was shown to detect a wide range of IBV genotypes [23] . cDNA amplicons of expected size were obtained with S9-S5 (isolates Italy-02; 04; 06 and 08) or with S9-S8 (isolates Italy-01, 05, 07, 09 and 10) primers. However, one isolate, Italy-03, demonstrated negative result by RT-PCR using all combinations of the S1 gene primers. Primers IBVN1 and IBVN2 successfully amplified cDNA in all samples and the resulting PCR product contained N gene sequence that was informative for the differentiation of all strains. These primers have been shown previously to amplify 18 IBV strains of different serotypes isolated in the USA, Europe and Japan [25] . Partial nucleotide sequences of S1 and N genes of the Italian isolates were initially compared with published IBV sequences using BLAST search within the EMBL/GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Reference IBV strains included in the final dendrograms and used for comparisons (Table 2) comprised viruses identified previously in Italy (M41, 793/B, 624/I, QXIBV and B1648) as well as IBVs from China, USA and Australia, however, their number was limited by availability of corresponding N gene sequences in databases.",

The analysis showed that the Italian isolates identified in this study fell into three distinct genotypes. Six isolates belonged to two genotypes that had circulated in Italy since 1990s [16, 17] ; five of them were placed together with 793/B-type strains and one isolate had very close sequence relationship (94.6% nucleotide identity) with 624/I strain. No Massachusetts or B1648 type viruses were detected in contrast to 1997 data [16] .

For one of the variant viruses, Italy-02, which afterwards became the prototype strain, S1 gene was sequenced in its entirety and deposited to sequence database. Comparative S1 gene analysis of this strain and reference strains has been reported recently by others [20] . Four Spanish isolates of this type, that were identified as a new serotype and genotype, shared 96.6-98.0% S1 gene nucleotide identity with Italy-02 and not more than 84% with all of the other strains.",

Italian viruses from the first group formed two mixed subgroups (Mass + 624/ I + Italy-02 and 793/B + Italy-02) that consisted of representatives of different S1 genotypes. Thus, three variant IBVs of Italy-02 genotype, shared 96.7-99.2% S1 gene nucleotide identity with each other but belonged to three separate subgroups based on more conserved N gene sequences (89.7-93% identity). This could suggest that part of N gene from these isolates might have different origin, while very similar parts of S1 gene might evolve by recombination events, however, we do not know the parental N gene sequence for this genotype. Only one of the five 793/B-type isolates (Italy-10) clustered with the 793/B strain sharing 99.3% partial N gene identity, whereas the other four isolates were genetically distant from them (only 87.7-89.7% identity) and formed separate subgroup together with Italy-08 isolate.

Since both viruses were isolated from chickens vaccinated with live Mass-type vaccine, this data might indicate the involvement of the H120 strain in generation of these two isolates, which could obtain their S1 sequences by recombination. Unfortunately, N gene sequences of certain IBV strains that could be extremely useful for such evolutionary predictions are not available (624/I and B1648) or very limited (only one 793/B sequence), therefore we can consider recombination only as a probable mechanism of evolution for some Italian IBVs.",

IBV population is Fig. 2 Phylogenetic relationships of Italian IBV isolates and selected reference strains based on the partial S1 gene sequences (a) comprising 166-549 bp (numbering corresponds to H120 vaccine strain [M21970]) and partial N gene sequences (b) comprising first 300 bp beginning from AUG start codon. The rooted trees were generated by MegAlign 5.00 program from the Clustal W multiple sequence alignment (DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI). IBV genotypes that Italian isolates belong to are designated by braces. Italian isolates are shown in bold type. Vaccine strain H120 is boxed considered to be in a state of continuous flux with appearance of new drifts and shifts in their genome [15] . Several factors determine IBV evolution including general factors such as inherent high mutability of RNA genome due to the absence of proof-reading mechanisms during replication, and more specific for IBV, namely, widespread use of live vaccines, immunological pressure caused by immune bird population, frequent mixed infections, the ability to replicate in very many tissues [15, 31, 32] .",

Thus, phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene has suggested that the Italy-02 genotype has a mosaic sequence (5\u00a2 region shared maximum similarity with D274 and 3\u00a2 region with 4/91 strains) and it has undergone a recombination event [20] . Our S1 gene analysis of three Italian isolates of this type confirmed the high 5\u00a2 region nucleotide identity with D274, while N gene analysis displayed indication of potential intergenic recombination. Phylogenetic analysis of S1 and N gene sequences of IBVs from Japan, Taiwan and Korea revealed that recombination has occurred frequently between field strains [27, 35] . Thus, three Japanese strains might all be recombinant viruses derived from Australian and North American IBVs. The phylogenetic trees constructed from the S1 and N genes have indicated recombination in other two field isolates from Taiwan [28] . Sequence analysis of Australian strains of new N4/02 type has shown high N gene similarity with previously detected subgroup 1 viruses and very low level of S1 gene identity with them [31] . Our data has provided the evidence that both genome mutations and intergenic recombination events could have taken place in the evolution of the Italian IBV isolates of different genotypes.",
