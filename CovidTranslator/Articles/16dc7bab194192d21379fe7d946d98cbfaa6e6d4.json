            "text": "The canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC) is an endemic worldwide syndrome involving multiple viral and bacterial pathogens. Traditionally, Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine herpesvirus (CHV) and canine parainfluenza virus (CPiV) were considered the major causative agents. Lately, new pathogens have been implicated in the development of CIRDC, namely canine influenza virus (CIV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine pneumovirus (CnPnV), Mycoplasma cynos and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus. To better understand the role of the different pathogens in the development of CIRDC and their epidemiological relevance in Europe, prevalence data were collected from peerreviewed publications and summarized. Evidence of exposure to Bb is frequently found in healthy and diseased dogs and client-owned dogs are as likely to be infected as kennelled dogs. Co-infections with viral pathogens are common. The findings confirm that Bb is an important cause of CIRDC in Europe. CAV-2 and CDV recovery rates from healthy and diseased dogs are low and the most likely explanation for this is control through vaccination. Seroconversion to CHV can be demonstrated following CIRDC outbreaks and CHV has been detected in the lower respiratory tract of diseased dogs. There is some evidence that CHV is not a primary cause of CIRDC, but opportunistically re-activates at the time of infection and exacerbates the disease. The currently available data suggest that CIV is, at present, neither a prevalent nor a significant pathogen in Europe. CPiV remains an important pathogen in CIRDC and facilitates co-infection with other viral and bacterial pathogens. CnPnV and CRCoV are important new elements in the aetiology of CIRDC and spread particularly well in multi-dog establishments. M. cynos is common in Europe and is more likely to occur in younger and kennelled dogs. This organism is frequently found together with other CIRDC pathogens and is significantly associated with more severe respiratory signs. S. zooepidemicus infection is not common and appears to be a particular problem in kennels. Protective immunity against respiratory diseases is rarely complete, and generally only a reduction in clinical signs and excretion of pathogen can be achieved through vaccination. However, even vaccines that only reduce and do not prevent infection carry epidemiological advantages. They reduce spread, increase herd immunity and decrease usage of antimicrobials. Recommending vaccination of dogs against pathogens of CIRDC will directly provide epidemiological advantages to the population and the individual dog.",

Host and environmental factors play a role in the development of the disease and its severity. CIRDC has been referred to historically as 'kennel cough' or 'canine infectious tracheobronchitis' and is described as an acute, highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs. The disease is characterized by sudden onset, paroxysmal, dry, 'honking' cough with variable expectoration and naso-ocular discharge (Ford and Vaden, 1998) . Signs last for days to weeks and are mild to moderate in most dogs. In puppies and dogs with immunosuppression or other concurrent diseases, CIRDC can be complicated by bronchopneumonia, resulting in more severe signs such as dyspnoea, weight loss, pyrexia and even death (Radhakrishnan et al., 2007) .",

It commonly spreads where large numbers of dogs are housed in close confinement (e. g. in shelters or boarding kennels) or are gathered (e. g. at dog shows and training classes) . The disease is rapidly transmitted through droplets or asymptomatic carriers as most of its pathogens are ubiquitous. It is thought that, in most cases, viral infections initially damage the epithelium of the upper respira-tory tract (Ford and Vaden, 1998) , allowing secondary bacterial infections to add to the destruction and inflammation in the upper respiratory tract. As the host immune response is initiated, spread of the infection into the lower respiratory tract is normally prevented and the infection eventually cleared. Under adverse circumstances however, the infection may reach the lower airways and cause pneumonia or chronic respiratory disease.",

Research has concentrated on Bb infections in pigs (atrophic rhinitis), dogs (CIRDC), laboratory animals (bronchopneumonia) and increasingly man (Woolfrey and Moody, 1991; Ducours et al., 2017) . The bacterium can act as a primary pathogen in dogs (Wright et al., 1973) or cause CIRDC concurrently with other bacteria and/or viruses. Bb belongs to the genus Bordetella together with Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis, which cause whooping cough in man (reviewed by Mattoo and Cherry, 2005) . Of the three species, only Bb survives in the environment and appears to be able to spread through amoeba (Taylor-Mulneix et al., 2017) . On entering a mammalian host, the bacterium expresses virulence factors including adhesins such as filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA), pertactin, tracheal colonization factor and fimbriae that facilitate adhesion to host cells (Edwards et al., 2005) , and toxins, such as adenylate cyclase haemolysin, dermonecrotic toxin and tracheal cytotoxin that damage the ciliated epithelium (Bock and Gross, 2001) . The signals for the in-vivo change from the 'environmental' to the 'host' phase are unknown. In vitro, however, growth at 37 C was determined to be a trigger.",

            "text": "Bb is a common pathogen and able to cause CIRDC without the help of respiratory viruses (Schulz et al., 2014b; Viitanen et al., 2015) . The incubation time is between 2 and 10 days (Bemis et al., 1977) . Affected animals develop a dry paroxysmal cough, nasal discharge and, only in severe cases, depression, pneumonia and death. The morbidity is high, but the disease is rarely fatal. Histopathology has shown that infection is limited to the ciliated mucosa where an inflammatory response with an influx of polymorphonuclear cells can be observed (Thompson et al., 1976; Bemis et al., 1977) . Through adhesion to the cilia and the excretion of toxins the bacterium is thought to cause ciliostasis and failure of mucociliary clearance (Woolfrey and Moody, 1991) . Disease duration varies from a few days in mild cases to weeks or longer in more severely affected dogs (Thompson et al., 1976; Canonne et al., 2016) . Bb is shed from the respiratory tract of infected animals for a variable length of time, sometimes many months. Immunity to Bb involves the local mucosal production of specific immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG antibodies, although serum IgG responses are also made and these are more readily used to monitor the efficacy of vaccination in an experimental setting (Chalker et al., 2003b) . Treatment includes antibiotics that reach therapeutic concentrations in the respiratory tract (Datz, 2003) . CAV-2 is an non-enveloped DNA virus belonging to the family Adenoviridae. The virus is highly related to canine hepatitis virus (CAV-1) and shares approximately 75% of the nucleotide sequence (reviewed by Buonavoglia and Martella, 2007) . CAV-2 is limited to the respiratory tract and to a lesser degree the intestinal epithelium, while CAV-1 causes systemic infection. There is one report of the molecular detection of CAV-2 in the brain of a puppy with neurological signs (Benetka et al., 2006) , but in this case no histopathological changes were detected in the brain suggesting viral pathology.",

Although the virus is generally still referred to as CPiV in veterinary medicine, the correct nomenclature evolved from 'parainfluenza virus 5' (Rima et al., 2014) to 'mammalian orthorubulavirus 5', and this name is consistent with the isolation of the virus from various mammals, including man and dogs (ICTV, 2018) . The virus is highly contagious and therefore endemic worldwide. It was first isolated together with other pathogens in 1967 from laboratory dogs with respiratory disease. Transmission occurs via droplets. Morbidity depends on the density of the dog population as the virus does not survive for long in the environment. The site of entry is the respiratory tract. CPiV is known to mainly affect the surface epithelium of the respiratory tract and to rarely cause systemic infection (Appel and Binn, 1987) . Clinical signs involve mild respiratory signs 2e8 days after infection that last less than a week unless the disease is complicated by other pathogens (Viitanen et al., 2015) . Very young, geriatric or immunocompromised dogs may also show systemic signs. There are occasional reports of CPiV being isolated from tissues outside the respiratory tract, but these are exceptions (Binn et al., 1979; Buonavoglia and Martella, 2007) . It is assumed that immunity to CPiV involves local mucosal production of specific antibody, but most published studies measure systemic antibody responses (Ellis and Krakowa, 2012) . Mucosal and parenteral CPiV vaccines are available.",

CRCoV is genetically distinct from canine enteric and pantropic alpha coronavirus. CRCoV is probably transmitted via droplets and initially infects ciliated epithelial cells in the trachea and lymphoid cells of the tonsils (reviewed by Priestnall et al., 2014) .

Mycoplasma spp. are normal commensals of the upper respiratory tract, which has complicated investigations into their virulence. M. cynos was first described in 1972 following isolation from the lungs of a dog with pneumonia. Since then M. cynos has been detected in many other cases of CIRDC, often concurrently with viral infections, confounding the interpretation of its role in the pathogenesis of CIRDC (reviewed by Priestnall et al., 2014; Maboni et al., 2018 ). However, Zeugswetter et al.

Bb is known to reside in the upper respiratory tract of healthy animals (Gueirard et al., 1998) so the lack of detection by Stejskal et al. (2017) , in which nasal and pharyngeal swabs were analysed by both culture and PCR, is surprising.

In this retrospective study, microbiology results of 493 dogs with signs of respiratory disease were reviewed for isolation of Bb over 22 years (1989e2011).

Samples for this study were collected over a 12-month period from 2011 to 2012, which may have been a time of unusually high Bb prevalence in the South of Germany.

Reports into the prevalence of CDV in healthy dogs or dogs with CIRDC were sparse. In Germany (Schulz et al., 2014b) and Finland (Viitanen et al., 2015) neither healthy dogs nor dogs with CIRDC were infected with CDV. Woehrer et al. (2016) found CDV in 16.2% of Austrian dogs with pneumonia when investigating historical samples by immunohistochemistry. All CDV-positive dogs were #12 months of age and many had concurrent neurological and/or gastrointestinal signs. Di Francesco et al. (2012) reported a CDV prevalence of 56.6% in Italian dogs that suffered from respiratory signs coupled with neurological and/or gastrointestinal signs. An investigation into a CDV outbreak amongst dogs imported from Hungary in 2015 showed that seven of 11 dogs with distemper had clinical signs involving at least two organ systems, mainly the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts (Willi et al., 2015) . Even if CDV is rarely diagnosed in dogs in Europe, the infection remains in the wild population, as for example in foxes (Garigliany et al., 2018) , with a constant risk of infection of the canine population. These findings suggest that CDV usually causes systemic disease, but distemper presenting mainly as respiratory disease has been described (Chvala et al., 2007) . CDV involvement in CIRDC appears to be rare due to vaccination. Mitchell et al. (2017) showed that vaccination against CDV was associated with a significantly lower risk of CIRDC and severe respiratory signs.",

CHV has been implicated as a causative agent of CIRDC because experimental infections have resulted in respiratory signs (Karpas et al., 1968; Appel et al., 1969) . In Belgium, approximately half of investigated dogs, including healthy dogs and dogs with various ailments, were found to be seropositive (Ronsse et al., 2002) . In Germany, Italy, Lithuania and the UK, seropositivity or PCR positivity ranged from 0.0% to 27.7% in healthy adult dogs Erles and Brownlie, 2005; Manteufel et al., 2008; Musayeva et al., 2013; Pratelli et al., 2014; Schulz et al., 2014b; Bottinelli et al., 2016) . In some instances, seropositivity was higher in kennelled dogs or increased following a stay at a kennel Erles and Brownlie, 2005; Musayeva et al., 2013) . In Norway, 80% of healthy adult dogs were seropositive for CHV (Krogenaesa et al., 2012) . Seropositivity is higher in dogs with reproductive problems than in healthy dogs (Van Gucht et al., 2001; Dahlbom et al., 2009; Cobzariu et al., 2018) . Erles et al. (2004) found CHV in 12.8% of tracheal samples and 9.6% of lung samples of shelter dogs that were humanely destroyed because of behavioural problems or severe (including respiratory) diseases. The presence of CHV was more likely if dogs had moderate to severe signs of CIRDC, but this was not significant. In another study (Erles and Brownlie, 2005) , CHV was not isolated from tonsillar swabs of dogs from two training kennels, which occasionally had outbreaks of CIRDC; however, there was seroconversion against CHV following these outbreaks. Vojtek et al. (2010) investigated the presence of antibodies against CHV in 20 dogs with CIRDC and found that 60% were positive, while none of the healthy control dogs tested seropositive. Kaczorek et al. (2016) isolated CHV from 80% of dogs with CIRDC and found that detection was more successful with tracheal lavage samples than swabs from the upper respiratory tract. Unfortunately this study did not contain a control population. Schulz et al. (2014b) failed to find CHV in healthy dogs and dogs with CIRDC when testing nasal and pharyngeal swabs. A Finnish study of dogs with bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis did not yield any CHV when BALF and transtracheal washes were tested (Viitanen et al., 2015) .",

            "text": "European publications reporting the prevalence of CPiV in healthy and diseased dogs were reviewed (Table 6 ). CPiV is found commonly in samples of dogs with and without respiratory signs. Schulz et al. (2014b) detected CPiV in 7.8% of healthy German dogs. Erles et al. (2004) detected CPiV in 19.4% of tracheal samples and 10.4% of lung samples of dogs humanely destroyed at a UK shelter. Since 65% of these dogs showed respiratory signs before humane destruction, the results cannot be compared directly with those of a healthy population. The higher detection rate in tracheal samples (19.4%) compared with lung samples (10.4%) is characteristic for the virus as its target tissue is mainly ciliated epithelium of the upper respiratory tract (Appel and Binn, 1987) . In dogs with CIRDC or bronchial pneumonia, CPiV was detected in 6.5%e67.5% of animals (Schulz et al., 2014b; Viitanen et al., 2015; Decaro et al., 2016; Kaczorek et al., 2016; Hiebl et al., 2019) . CPiV prevalence in healthy and diseased dogs was compared in one study and shown to be significantly higher if dogs had CIRDC (Schulz et al., 2014b) . In contrast, Erles et al. (2004) reported tracheal CPiV in 20% of dogs without respiratory signs and 19% of dogs with respiratory signs. The lack of an association between clinical signs and CPiV detection in this study can have many explanations. Dogs with pre-existing immunity to CPiV through vaccination and past exposure may still become infected with CPiV field strains, but are less likely to show clinical signs (Emery et al., 1976) . Since 44% of the dogs in the study by Erles et al. (2004) had antibodies against CPiV on arrival at the shelter, they would have been protected from clinical signs, although virus shedding may have still occurred. Another explanation is that dogs with CPiV-positive samples and without clinical signs were humanely destroyed during an early stage of infection when clinical signs were not yet detectable. Furthermore, close-contact housing in the shelter and circulation of a field CPiV strain amongst the shelter dogs may have distorted detection rates in this study. Decaro et al. (2016) investigated the presence of CPiV in dogs with acute CIRDC, dogs exposed to CIRDC and CIRDC convalescent dogs and reported detection rates of 20.5%, 4.5% and 2.6%, respectively, suggesting that CPiV is more commonly found in dogs with signs of CIRDC than in dogs without such signs. Statistical analysis of the association between a respiratory score and the presence of CPiV approached significance in this study (P \u00bc 0.063). In another study, approximately one third of dogs with bacterial pneumonia carried CPiV (Viitanen et al., 2015) . The authors speculated that initial infection with CPiV may predispose dogs to lung infections with opportunistic bacteria. Kaczorek et al. (2016) reported the highest prevalence of CPiV in dogs with CIRDC of 67.5%, but no healthy control group was included in this study.",

Decaro et al. (2016) found a lower prevalence of CnPnV in dogs with CIRDC (6.41%) than Mitchell et al. (2017; 22.2%) and no association with severe clinical signs. The differences may be explained by the higher proportion of client-owned dogs in the former study. CnPnV was not detected in dogs with bacterial pneumonia or chronic Bb infections (Viitanen et al., 2015) , suggesting that CnPnV does not play a significant role in these more chronic respiratory diseases. Decaro et al. (2016) found co-infections of CnPnV with CRCoV or Bb and M. canis in two of five dogs (40%) in Italy. Kennelled dogs in the UK showed co-infection of CnPnV with CRCoV and/or CPiV in 69.5% of cases (Mitchell et al., 2013) . Mitchell et al. (2017) were able to demonstrate that the presence of CRCoV doubled the likelihood of a positive result for CnPnV. Therefore, CnPnV can be considered as an important new pathogen in CIRDC, often found in co-existence with CRCoV. CnPnV spreads particularly well in multi-dog establishments. Exposure appears to result in protective immunity against clinical signs suggesting that vaccination may be effective against this pathogen. ",

Antibodies to CRCoV were found in Italian dog samples from 1999 onwards (Priestnall et al., 2007) . showed antibodies against CRCoV, with considerable regional variability Erles and Brownlie, 2005; Priestnall et al., 2006) , which appeared to be correlated to the population density. Seroprevalence was found to increase with age and exposure to other dogs. Adult dogs are significantly more likely to be seropositive for CRCoV than dogs <1 year of age (Priestnall et al., 2006 (Priestnall et al., , 2007 . Presumably this can be explained by increasing contact with other dogs and therefore a rising risk of exposure to CRCoV with advancing age. Mitchell et al. (2017) reported that the seroprevalence in shelter dogs was higher (55.6%) than in client-owned dogs (36.7%). Following arrival at a kennel, the majority of seronegative dogs seroconverted within 3 weeks, so that the seroprevalence in some kennels reached nearly 100% Erles and Brownlie, 2005) . When the seroprevalence for CRCoV was monitored in two kennels for 2 years, it was found that seroconversion was often preceded by an outbreak of CIRDC (Erles and Brownlie, 2005) . Seronegative dogs had a significantly higher risk of developing CIRDC following arrival than seropositive dogs . Furthermore, CRCoV is frequently detected in the respiratory tract of dogs with respiratory disease. Woehrer et al. (2016) found 15.5% of pathological samples from dogs with pneumonia contained CRCoV. Some of the positive samples were co-infected with Bb and/or bacterial pathogens. Decaro et al. (2007) detected CRCoV in one dog (0.92%) in Italy that had died of a canine parvovirus infection. Higher detection rates were observed by Decaro et al. (2016) when investigating dogs that were acutely affected by CIRDC (8.97%), had been exposed to dogs with CIRDC (1.28%) or were CIRDC convalescent (5.26%). Just under half of the CRCoV-positive dogs in this study showed coinfections with CPiV, CnPnV, Bb and/or Mycoplasma species. Schulz et al. (2014b) found CRCoV in 9.8% of dogs with CIRDC and in no healthy control dogs. The difference in detection rates was significant. Furthermore, all CRCoV-positive dogs in that study had co-infections with Bb. Similar detection rates were obtained for dogs with CIRDC in Austria (8.8%, Spiss, 2012; 7.5%, Hiebl et al., 2019) , Greece (8.6%), Hungary (7.4%), France (11.5%) and The Netherlands (13.6%) (Mitchell et al., 2017) . The presence of CRCoV was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing severe signs of CIRDC in a European study (Mitchell et al., 2017) .",

Chalker et al. (2004) demonstrated that there is a significant association between M. cynos infection and young age (<1 year), time spent at a shelter (>1 week) and CIRDC. Schulz et al. (2015) also showed a notable difference in the proportion of dogs with Mycoplasma spp. in BALF samples between healthy dogs (18.8%) and dogs with respiratory signs (37.9%), but the difference was not significant. Not all dogs with respiratory signs had infectious diseases, as dogs with airway collapse and reverse sneezing were also included, which may have reduced the statistical power of the study. Similarly, Canonne et al. (2016) could not demonstrate a significant difference in the presence of M. cynos between healthy and diseased dogs. Reasons for this may have been the small animal number in this study and antibiotic pre-treatment of diseased dogs, which may have reduced the number of positive dogs. Woehrer et al. (2016) found mycoplasma in 2.9% of dogs with pneumonia in a retrospective study of histopathological samples. Considerably higher detection rates were achieved using BALF samples of dogs with bacterial pneumonia (40%; Viitanen et al., In two studies investigating dogs with Bb infections, Mycoplasma spp. were also found in 23.1% (Viitanen et al., 2015) and 53% (M. cynos only, Canonne et al., 2016) of animals. Schulz et al. (2015) and Decaro et al. (2016) also found co-infections of M. cynos with Bb. In the latter study co-infections of M. cynos with respiratory viruses (CPiV, CRCoV) were also reported.",

This is in accordance with the results of Chalker et al.

The greater and longer the exposure to respiratory pathogens in the field, the more likely are infection and clinical disease (Foley et al., 2002; Mitchell et al., 2013) . A reduction in shedding is therefore likely to result in less environmental contamination and slow the spread to other dogs. Field studies utilising intranasal vaccines against canine respiratory pathogens have demonstrated that their use leads to a decreased incidence of CIRDC. Glickman and Appel (1981) found that a trivalent vaccine containing Bb, CPiV and CAV-2 was 71.2% and 81.8% effective at reducing the incidence of coughing in a Beagle breeding facility during summer and winter, respectively. Another study demonstrated that intranasal vaccination in a shelter setting helped to reduce coughing by 24.4% for a trivalent vaccine and 20.7% for a bivalent vaccine (Edinboro et al., 2004) . Finally, Mitchell et al. (2017) were able to demonstrate a significant level of protection from CIRDC and severe respiratory signs in dogs vaccinated against CDV, CAV-2 and CPiV. Others could only demonstrate a nonsignificant protective effect following vaccination against CPiV Schulz et al., 2014b) , perhaps because the study populations were too small to show significant differences.",

Vaccinated dogs shed vaccine strains for a variable duration after vaccination (Ruch-Gullie et al., 2016) . Shedding can interfere with the diagnosis of field infection as the strains cannot usually be distinguished. An obvious advantage of vaccine strain shedding, however, is the spread to other in-contact dogs and stimulation of their immune systems to develop immunity or augment existing protection. Since the vaccine strains are attenuated, they do not usually cause disease in na\u20ac \u0131ve in-contact dogs (Zoetis, data on file). Therefore, immunity in the canine population can be increased directly through vaccination and indirectly through contact of non-vaccinated dogs with vaccinated dogs.",

Antimicrobial use in animals can contribute to the emergence of resistant bacteria that can be transferred to people through direct contact.

Prudent use of antibiotics is therefore indicated and if patients only show mild, transient clinical signs of CIRDC, antimicrobial therapy will not generally be required.",

There are multiple viral and bacterial causes of CIRDC, which can all be primary pathogens, but often co-infect to complicate the disease. Vaccines against four of the causative pathogens are available that confer epidemiological advantages by reducing the spread of the pathogens, increasing herd immunity through shedding of the vaccine and decreasing the need for antibiotic treatment.
