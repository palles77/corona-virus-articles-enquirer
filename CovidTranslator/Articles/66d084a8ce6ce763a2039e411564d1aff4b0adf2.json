How can a material object became aware of the world around it and of its very own awareness? Many scholars think this question is unanswerable. New approaches to this age-old mind-body problem have recently been encouraged by the development of PET and MRI and the powerful tools of modern neuroscience. We are now witnessing the explosive growth of a new field, called cognitive neuroscience which focuses on behavior and uses classical reaction-time paradigms together with new computer-based technology.",

At the level of the brain it is possible to record PET and MRI and by using an animal model to analyse cellular and molecular mechanisms. The advantage of this approach, which I call the conscious state paradigm, is that it, is quantitative, integrative, and holistic (in the rigorous sense of that word). The brain basis of activation (A) input-output gaining (I) and modulation (M) can now be described in relation to the changes in consciousness associated with them. The data can be used to create a three-dimensional model (AIM) which describes the brain-mind trajectory in its state space.",

            "text": "Neural circuits in many parts of the developing nervous system exhibit highly rhythmic episodes of electrical activity. Such activity has generally been considered to fine tune connections that are initially made by axons responding to a complex array of molecular guidance cues. However, chick and mouse spinal cords exhibit activity at early stages as motoneurons are still migrating and beginning to extend their axons. Modest alterations in the frequency of such episodes produced changes in the expression of several guidance/recognition molecules and caused motor axon pathfinding errors. Interestingly the type of pathfinding decision, the binary dorsal-ventral choice or the subsequent pool specific fasciculation and projection of axons to specific muscles, was differentially affected by decreasing or increasing the frequency respectively. Thus, activity generated by developing circuits interacts at early stages with the molecular signaling pathways that govern the formation of precise circuits and any drugs that alter this activity could adversely affect circuit formation.",

Although each area has been defined based on anatomical and physiological criteria, functional roles played by each of them have been the matter of much debate. In fact, in a recent trend of research reports, it is popular to stress commonalities rather than specificities in the use of multiple cortical areas in motor control. For instance, the involvement of the primary motor cortex in cognitive aspects of motor behavior has been an eye-catching subject of recent reports. The involvement of the prefrontal cortex in movement planning has also been inferred. Up to a certain extent, it is true that the use of different areas have some factors in common. However, it is a mistake to ignore profound differences in the use of each area, depending on specific aspects of motor behavior. In this lecture, I will describe such differences that could be clarified only when neural activities are examined properly, by studies designed to reveal individual aspects of functional significance of each area.",

To elucidate this mechanism we have identified and characterized kinesin superfamily proteins, KIFs, using molecular cell biology, molecular genetics, biophysics, and structural biology. KIFs play essential roles on neuronal function and survival by transporting synaptic vesicle precursors (KIF1A/KIF1Bbeta), NMDA type(KIF17) and AMPA type(KIF5s) glutamate receptors and mRNAs(KIF5s) such as CaMKII \u2424 mRNA and Arc mRNA with a large RNA-transporting protein complex containing at least 42 RNA related proteins such as hn RNP-U, Staufen, and FMRPs. KIF2A is fundamental for correct brain wiring by suppressing elongation of axon collaterals through depolymerizing microtubules in growth cones. KIF3 suppresses tumorigenesis by transporting Ncadherin/beta catenin containing vesicles from Golgi to plasma membrane in the neuroepithelium. KIF4 controls the activity-dependent survival of postmitotic neurons by regulating PARP-1 activity in brain development. Thus, KIFs play significant roles not only on various neuronal functions but also on brain wiring, development and higher brain functions such as memory and learning.",

Such concept is considered as the basis of neurorehabilitation, however, the mechanism of the \"take-over\" is not well understood. In this talk, I will present our recent progress in two lines of studies using non-human primate models related to this issue. The first topic is on the recovery of dexterous finger movements after lesion of the lateral corticospinal tract at the cervical spinal cord. After the virtually complete lesion, relatively independent finger movements can be recovered in 1-3 months. We have found that bilateral primary motor and ventral premotor cortices are involved at various stages of the recovery process by combining the PET imaging and reversible local inactivation technique. In the second, I will talk about the visuo-motor processing in monkeys with unilateral lesion of the primary visual cortex (V1). After complete ablation of V1, the monkeys recover performance of visually guided saccades toward the blind field in 2 months. Saccades to the blind field have low sensitivity and less accurate. However, the monkeys can perform surprisingly cognitively demanding tasks in the blind field. I will discuss on our hypothesis on the bottom-up and top-down control of learning during recovery.",

We developed and applied mouse reverse genetic technologies to examine these molecular mechanisms. We have focused on the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) and calcium-stimulated adenylyl cyclases, as NMDAR-and cAMP-cascades are central to various types of neuronal plasticity, both in adulthood and during development.

We show that mammalian 7-pass transmembrane cadherins Celsr2 and Celsr3 are activated by their homophilic interactions and regulate neurite growth in a distinct manner. Both gene-silencing and co-culture assay showed that Celsr2 enhanced neurite growth whereas Celsr3 suppressed it. Our result suggested that Celsr2 had a stronger activity as G-protein coupled receptor than Celsr3 did, most likely due to a difference of a single amino acid residue in the transmembrane domain, and this functional difference resulted in distinct effects in neurite growth regulation. Thus, neuron-neuron interactions modulate neurite growth differentially through this couple of 7-pass transmembrane cadherins.",

While a number of cell surface molecules should be involved in such processes, cadherin adhesion molecules play a role. When cadherin activities are blocked, synaptic contacts become destabilized in cultured neurons. This is also the case in vivo; e.g., in the neural retina whose cadherin activities are impaired without perturbing their overall architecture, a certain class of synaptic contacts does not normally form. Another series of our study demonstrate that the cadherins cooperate with nectins, a subfamily of Ig-domain molecules, for establishment of axon-dendritic contacts: in early hippocampal pyramidal neurons, nectin-1 is preferentially localized in axons; and nectin-3, in both axons and dendrites. We present evidence that the heterophilic binding between axonal nectin-1 and dendritic nectin-3 is important for facilitating the axon-dendritic attachment; and cadherins seem to be required to stabilize the nectin-initiated contacts. Thus, multiple classes of adhesion molecules work together to ensure the correct linking between axons and dendrites.",

Retrogradestaining of OSN axons indicated that the dorsal/ventral (D/V) arrangement of glomeruli in the OB is correlated with the expression areas of corresponding ORs along the dorsomedial/ventrolateral axis in the OE. In contrast, the anterior/posterior (A/P) arrangement of glomeruli appears to be independent of the epithelial locations of OSNs and more dependent on the expressed ORs. It was found that G proteinmediated cAMP signals regulate the positioning of glomeruli along the A/P axis in the OB. We also found that multiple sets of cell adhesion molecules, e.g., ephrin-As and Eph-As, are expressed in a complementary manner, whose transcription levels are uniquely correlated with the expressing OR species. We propose that differential levels of repulsive/adhesive interactions of axon termini may regulate the sorting of like-axons during the process of OSN projection.",

One important issue to be addressed is how individual axons are instructed to invade and arborize in particular laminae. Projection of hippocampal mossy fibers is one of good experimental models to analyze molecular mechanisms that govern lamina-restricted termination of axons, because the fibers project to the proximal dendritic segment of CA3 pyramidal cells. We here report the following three mechanisms that provide lamina-restricted projection of mossy fibers. First, a neural repellent Sema6A is expressed in CA3 pyramidal cells and principally suppresses invasion of mossy fibers to CA3. Second, the repulsive signal of Sema6A is mediated by plexin-A4 expressing in mossy fibers. Third, the repulsive activities of Sema6A are attenuated by plexin-A2 in the proximal dendritic segments of CA3 pyramidal cells, resulting in the segments permissive for mossy fibers to invade.",

Some of these models can quantitatively reproduce subject behaviors given sensory inputs and reward and action sequences which subjects received and generated. These computational models possess putative information representation such as error signals for internal models, action stimulus dependent reward prediction, and they can be used as explanatory variables in neuroimaging and neurophysiology experiments. We named this approach as computationalmodel-based neuroimaging, as well as computational-model-based neurophysiology. This new approach is very attractive and appealing since this is probably the only method with which we can explore neural representations remote from either sensory or motor interfaces.

Fruitless masculinizes these neurons thereby establishing the neural substrates for male-typical behavior. By experiments that label individually the neurons that express Fruitless, we have identified a subset of brain interneurons that display marked sexual dimorphism in their number and projection pattern. Fruitless supports the development of those neurons with male-specific dendritic fields, which are programmed to die during development in females as a result of the absence of Fruitless.

Tetanic stimulation causes a persistent shift of actin equilibrium towards F-actin which enlarges dendritic spines. But the mechanisms which maintain these changes remain elusive. We propose that CaMKII \u2424 acts as an actin stabilizing molecule to maintain spine structure. CaMKII \u2424 is not only an abundant F-actin binding protein, it can also make oligomers. We found that CaMKII \u2424 oligomer crosslinks F-actin and stabilizes actin depolymerization kinetics. In spines, CaMKII \u2424 oligomer slows down actin dynamics and CaMKII \u2424 is enriched in spines by actin polymerization.

These experiments suggest that CaMKII \u2424 plays a role as a major stabilizer of the actin cytoskeleton to maintain spine structure. We also found that CaMKII \u2424 detaches from F-actin in an activity dependent manner. We will discuss how CaMKII \u2424 maintains actin equilibrium in activity dependent dendritic plasticity.",

Using 2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy in combination with a FRET-based Ras activity sensor, we visualized the activity of Ras signaling with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our studies indicate that calcium entry due to action potentials causes Ras to activate in a supra-linear manner (Yasuda et al., 2006) . Furthermore, in response to single spine stimulation using 2-photon glutamate uncaging, Ras activation initially occurs at the stimulated spine, subsequently spreading into its parent dendrites and nearby spines. These results suggest that nonlinear filtering by Ras regulators as well as the spatial spreading of Ras and Ras regulators shape spatiotemporal patterns of Ras signaling.",

Depending on the estimated origin, it is classified into cortical, brain stem, and spinal myoclonus. Cortical myoclonus is short in duration (50 ms). By back averaging EEG or MEG time-locked to spontaneous myoclonus, a cortical activity is demonstrated in the corresponding area of the contralateral primary motor cortex immediately preceding the myoclonus (by 20 ms for hand). It is mediated by fact-conducting corticospinal pathway. Cortical myoclonus is often stimulus-sensitive (cortical reflex myoclonus), showing extremely enhanced cortical responses to somatosensory or visual stimulus, and enhanced longloop transcortical reflexes. These findings, together with transcranial magnetic stimulation, suggest increased excitability of sensorimotor cortex in cortical myoclonus.",

Three main avenues of research have shown abnormalities in cortical inhibition, sensory processing including sensorimotor integration, and plasticity. This lecture will emphasize the abnormal inhibition. Abnormal inhibition appears to be the most direct cause of unwanted muscle contractions that make up both the involuntary spasms and the overflow movements also seen in this condition. A loss of inhibition is seen in spinal and brainstem reflexes, but these changes are likely secondary to cortical abnormalities. Cortical inhibition is also diminished as demonstrated most clearly with transcranial magnetic stimulation. GABA content may be decreased as shown with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A particular type of defective inhibition is surround inhibition, the inhibition that normally operates to sharpen fine skilled movements. Studies are now in progress to determine the synaptic mechanisms of surround inhibition and how this becomes abnormal in dystonia. Understanding about inhibition in dystonia has led to some new treatments including some non-invasive cortical stimulation methods.",

In this talk I will develop the idea that beta band synchronisation in the basal ganglia-cortical loop promotes tonic/postural contraction at the expense of new movements. Thus, spontaneous phasic increases in beta activity in healthy subjects can be shown to be associated with a slowing of voluntary movements and a reinforcement of transcortical stretch reflexes. Beta synchrony is also greatly exaggerated in untreated Parkinson disease, where it may bias against new movement and contribute to bradykinesia and rigidity. Excessive dopaminergic stimulation, either during treatment for Parkinson disease, or in conditions such as dystonia, may overly suppress beta activity in BG-cortical loops leading to excessive movement. Recordings of local field potentials in the basal ganglia of patients with movement disorders will be described that support this schema.",

Readiness for transmitter release, SVs are docked and primed at the cytomatrix at the active zone where proteins complex formation is regulated by phoshorylation. New kinase SAD-1 found at the SV and active zone or PKA phosphorylates specific proteins. SV exocytosis is triggered by conformational changes in the fusion proteins complex when Ca 2+ sensing protein was activated. Synchronies of SV fusion are maintained by a Ca 2+ sensing protein, synaptotagmin I.

To achieve their functions, i.e. neurotransmitter uptake and membrane fusion, they have to be equipped with specified proteins that play essential roles for each process. Since decades ago, we have witnessed major advances in our knowledge about the molecular constituents on synaptic vesicles and we've functionally characterized many key players on membrane fusion machinery such as SNARE proteins and the rab GTPases and on neurotransmitter uptake such as vesicular transporters and vacuolar H + -ATPase. However, a detailed picture of a vesicle membrane with all of its constituents is not yet available. In the present study, we have applied a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches on purified synaptic vesicles from rat brains in order to arrive at a comprehensive and quantitative description of synaptic vesicles. In particular, with a newly developed counting method for synaptic vesicles in solution, we estimated the copy number of each molecule in a single synaptic vesicle. SY1-3-11-3 SAD: A novel kinase implicated in phosphoproteome at the presynaptic active zone Toshihisa Ohtsuka Department of Clinical and Molecular Pathology, Faculty of Medicine/Graduate School of Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan SAD is a serine/threonine kianse, which has been shown to regulate various neuronal functions during development, including clustering synaptic vesicles, maturation of synapses, and axon/dendrite polarization: these have recently been revealed by genetic studies in C. elegans and mice. To test if SAD is also involved in synaptic functions at mature neurons such as neurotransmitter release, we have recently isolated and characterized human orthologues of SAD. Interestingly, SAD localizes both on synaptic vesicles and at the presynaptic active zones. Moreover, SAD, together with prominent active zone proteins CAST and Bassoon, is tightly associated with the active zone cytomatrix. In accord with its unique localization at the nerve terminals, SAD appears to be involved in a late step of neurotransmitter release, via direct phosphorylation of another active zone protein RIM1. Thus, these results suggest that SAD regulates not only neural polarization during development but also neurotransmitter release at mature synapses.",

The regulators of the SNARE system include many factors, such as the Rab3 system, Munc-13, Munc-18, Doc-2, and tomosyn. We have previously reported that tomosyn, a syntaxin-1-binding protein, works as a molecular clamp that controls free syntaxin-1 availability for the formation of the SNARE complex and thereby regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Here we show that PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of tomosyn decreases its binding to syntaxin-1, resulting in enhanced the formation of the SNARE complex. Conversely, ROCK phosphorylates syntaxin-1, which increases the affinity of syntaxin-1 for tomosyn and forms a stable complex with tomosyn, resulting in inhibition of the formation of the SNARE complex. Thus, tomosyn is likely to be an upstream regulator of the SNARE system, whose activity is regulated via well known signal transduction pathways.",

However, the physiological contributions of its Ca 2+ -binding domains (C 2 A and C 2 B) are still unclear. We have studied the roles of aspartate (Asp) residues in the C 2 B Ca 2+ -binding sites. In synaptotagmin I deficient neurons, although synchronous release was abolished as previously reported (Cell 79, p. 717) , asynchronous release was significantly increased. This defect was completely rescued by expressing wild-type synaptotagmin I, indicating the crucial roles of synaptotagmin I for triggering synchronous release and suppressing asynchronous release. Synaptotagmin I with mutations in the second or third Asp inhibited synchronous release, but still could suppress asynchronous release. Thus, we conclude that synaptotagmin I maintains the synchrony of transmitter release in two ways. Ca 2+ binding to the C 2 B is essential for synchronizing release. Suppressing of asynchronous release seems not to require Ca 2+ binding to the C 2 B because mutation in the second Asp inhibits Ca 2+ binding, yet still allows the protein to suppress asynchronous release.",

Recently, HGF is found to be a novel neurotrophic factor for various types of neurons, such as hippocampal, cerebral cortex, cerebral granular, motor, and sensory neurons. Mutant c-Met/HGF receptor knock-in mouse reveals that HGF decreases neuronal survival and axonal elongation of several types neurons, including motor, sympathetic and cerebral granular neurons, during development (Maina et al., 1999) . Therefore, it is possible to speculate that HGF could play an important role in the retardation or regeneration of neurons in neurodegenerative diseases. Here we show the examples of beneficial effects of HGF on model animals of different neural and neurodegenerative diseases, using several delivery methods for HGF including gene therapy approach. We also present the possible application of HGF in modifying the neurogenesis for the disease.",

At the acute/subacute stages, we observed reductions of these activations and/or addition of activation in ipsilateral cortex or contralateral adjacent cortex during paretic hand movements. At the chronic stages, recovery of activation and/or persistent addition of activation were observed. Thus, motor functional recovery was accompanied by restoration of brain activation and/or appearance of additional activation within the motor network of the brain. The findings suggest that cortical motor reorganization as well as recovery from reversible injury plays a role in the restoration of motor function. Interestingly, the time period during which reorganization occurred was limited to first 1-2 months after stroke, suggesting the presence of a critical period.",

(2) In human arm motor units, magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex produced multiple peaks at short latency in the post-stimulus time histogram, whose total duration was longer than the corresponding value of a finger muscle. Stimulation of the pyramidal tract in the medulla could also produce multiple peaks, though in a lower frequency.

Many recent findings have supported the idea that astrocytes, which are a subpopulation of glial cells, play a critical role in neuronal transmission in the central nervous system. We found that in vitro treatment with BPA caused the activation of astrocytes, as detected by a stellate morphology and an increase in levels of GFAP. A low concentration of BPA significantly enhanced the Ca 2+ responses to dopamine in both neurons and astrocytes. These findings provide evidence that BPA induces dopaminergic changes in neurons and astrocytes. This phenomenon may, at least in part, contribute to the enhancement by BPA of the development of psychological dependence on drugs of abuse.",

Hypofunction of the brainstem monoaminergic neurons is suggested. Pathology showed no degeneration. Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) located at Xq28 is the causative gene. Types of mutation at different functional domains are correlated to clinical severities. X-inactivation also influences phenotypic variability. MeCP2 was thought as a global transcriptional repressor, but finding of BDNF as a target gene suggest its role in the neuronal activity-dependent gene regulation. Genetic heterogeneities have been suggested and the mutation of cyclin dependent kinase-like 5 gene (CDKL5) manifest as atypical RTT. The mutations of MECP2 are found in other clinical conditions, such as X-linked mental retardation, Angelman syndrome, autism, and severe neonatal encephalopathy.

Subsequently, we have demonstrated that MPP+ induces release of cytochrome c but not activation of caspase and proposed that depletion of ATP and/or calcium-activated calpain-mediated degradation of procaspase-9 are responsible for the absence of subsequent activation of caspases. Furthermore, we have identified that degradation of several important proteins by activated calpain and proteasome system is linked to MPP+-mediated dopaminergic neuronal death. As such, we have found that one of onconeural proteins seems to play a role as a potential survival factor, degradation of which is involved in MPP+-induced cell death.

The role of ER stress in dopaminergic neuronal vulnerability was highlighted by their enhanced death in mice deficient in the ubiquitin-protein ligase Parkin and the ER chaperone ORP150, suggesting parkin dysfunction result in ER-stress mediated neuronal cell death. Conversely, transgenic rats overexpressing megsin (Tg meg), a newly identified serine protease inhibitor (serpin), demonstrated intraneuronal periodic-acid Schiff (PAS) positive inclusions, which distributed throughout the deeper layers of cerebral cortex, hippocampal CA3, and substantia nigrta. Enhanced ER stress was observed in dopamine neurons in SNpc, accompanied with loss of neuronal viability and motor coordination.

The mutation of the gene encoding tyrosine hydroxylase causes a deficit in conditioned taste memory after its reactivation. This memory deficit is restored by pharmacological stimulation of NA activity before the test and is also restored by intra-amygdala NA stimulation through \u24231or \u2424-adrenergic receptors. Moreover, intra-amygdala NA stimulation in the wild type animals increases their susceptibility to recall reconsolidated memory.

Rats subjected to single prolonged stress (SPS) exhibit the enhanced negative feedback of the HPA axis, exaggerated startle response, and analgesia. Thus, SPS is a good model of PTSD. We examined whether extinction of fear memory was impaired in SPS rats, using the contextual fear conditioning. SPS rats exhibited the significant longer freezing during re-exposure to the context 2-4 days after the conditioning. Furthermore, repeated administration of d-cycloserine markedly inhibited the development of enhanced freezing in SPS rats. We measured the levels of NMDA receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A, 2B, 2C), glycine transporter 1, and EAAC1, by real-time PCR. No significant changes were found in the hippocampus. Based on these findings, it is speculated that the increase in other types of glutamate transporters or NMDA receptor modification may play a role in impaired extinction in SPS rats.",

Wnt2b antagonizes proneural gene functions independent of the Notch signaling pathway, presumably through unidentified transcriptional repressors.

We found c-kit and SSEA-1 to be spatiotemporal markers of distinct populations of retinal progenitor cells, and these cells dramatically changed their expression profiles of c-kit and SSEA-1 during development. c-kit-positive cells expressed various immature retina specific genes; and later onset of rhodopsin expression and stronger proliferation activities were observed. c-kit/SSEA-1 double-positive cells showed stronger proliferation activities than ckit single-positive ones. Although the number of SSEA-1-positive cells was augmented by beta-catenin signal, c-kit-positive cells were positively regulated by Notch signaling, suggesting that c-kit and SSEA-1 have intrinsically distinct characters. Prolonged expression of c-kit by a retrovirus resulted in promotion of proliferation and the appearance of nestin-positive cells in response to SCF, suggesting a role for c-kit in retinal development. The retinal photoreceptor cells play a primal and central role in the phototransduction system. They are susceptible to deterioration in human retinal diseases, which lead to severe visual impairment. We have been demonstrated that transcription factors, Otx2 and Crx play critical roles in retinal photoreceptor development. While Otx2 is a key molecule for retinal photoreceptor cell fate determination, Crx is essential for the terminal differentiation and maturation of photoreceptors. Meanwhile, the photoreceptor cell is a highly polarized neuron and also has epithelial characteristics such as adherens junctions. Our investigation of a role of aPKC, which has been proposed to play a critical role in the establishment of epithelial and neuronal polarity, in differentiating photoreceptors has shown that aPKC is required for the formation of outer & inner segments and ribbon synapse.

We find that although FGF19 can induce the inner ear, it is unable to support differentiation of the inner ear. Differentiation, that is the development of the chick inner ear hair cells, is triggered by another family member FGF3 and is actually inhibited by FGF19. For full functionality, the inner ear needs to be integrated into the larger auditory complex, made up of the middle ear, the external ear and the auditory centers in the hindbrain.

To study how the OR-dependent axonal wiring is conducted, we analyzed the gene expression profile in the olfactory epithelium of the transgenic mouse in which the majority of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) express a particular OR gene. We found that the expression of the immunoglobulin superfamily gene Kirrel2, encoding homophillic adhesion molecule, is down-regulated in the transgenic mouse compared to the wild type control. The expression level of Kirrel2 in each OSN is found to be correlated with the type of OR species expressed in the OSN. Moreover, Kirrel2 promoted fasciculation of OSN axon termini in the mosaic gain-of-function experiment. Here, we propose that the information of which type of OR is expressed in the OSN is converted to the expression level of Kirrel2 which determines the adhesiveness of axon termini, contributing to OR-dependent segregation of OSN axons.",

Here we show that intracellular recycling of capsaicin receptor (TRPV1) was impaired in KJR neurons in contrast to that of C57BL/6J mice. By searching the candidate genes, EH domain-containing four (EHD4), a TRP-binding scaffold protein encoding gene was found. EHD4 binds to C-terminal of TRPV1. Three mutations were found in EHD4 of KJR, which remarkably diminished the binding, leading to changes in the intracellular distribution of TRPV1. This study is the first genetic dissection associated with capsaicin/heat resistance in a nature strain and shows a novel binding protein to TRPVs.

At least 28 genes and 12 loci have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and related inherited neuropathies. Most causes of inherited neuropathy have been discovered by positional cloning technique and in the past two years, the pace of CMT gene discovery has accelerated. These recently discovered CMT causing genes/proteins include those which, although showing unpredictable correlations with the peripheral nervous system, are definitely important for the peripheral nerve. Their discovery should pave the way for dramatic progress in the understanding of peripheral nerve biology. On the other hand, genotype-phenotype correlations of these genes are also important in order to understand the pathomechanisms of inherited neuropathy since, based on mutation studies, a large number of genes associated with both the demyelinating and axonal forms of CMT have been identified. To clarify the specific features and molecular mechanisms, we reviewed recent progress in CMT research, especially CMT4F caused by PRX, and SCAN1 caused by TDP1.

Some patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome have autoantibodies to gangliosides such as GM1, who show failure of peripheral motor nerve conduction. Sensitization of rabbits with GM1 can produce the disease model. In ventral roots from the paralyzed rabbits, IgG and complements deposited on the nodes of Ranvier, and sodium channel clusters were disrupted. In ganglioside-deficient mice with disrupted GM2/GD2 synthase gene, motor nerve conduction velocities were reduced in the sciatic nerves. Some myelin loops failed to contact the paranodal axolemma, and potassium channels were aberrantly localized at the paranodes. The abnormality became prominent with age. These findings using different models showed that gangliosides are important for the maintenance of the node of Ranvier and saltatory conduction along the myelinated nerve fibers.",

Spontaneous synchronous neuronal activity propagating through neocortical slices displays highly diverse, yet repeatable, activity patterns called 'neuronal avalanches'. They obey power-law distributions of the event sizes and lifetimes, presumably reflecting the structure of local cortical networks. However, the explicit network structure underlying the power-law statistics remains unclear. Here, we present a neuronal network model of pyramidal and inhibitory neurons that enables stable propagation of avalanche-like spiking activity. We demonstrate a neuronal wiring rule that governs the formation of mutually overlapping cell assemblies during the development of this network. The resultant network comprises a mixture of feedforward chains and recurrent circuits, in which neuronal avalanches are stable if the former structure is predominant.

We asked if spike patterns, i.e., combinations of interspike intervals within single bursts, carry information. Using the retinas of salamanders and mice, we found that bursts have various spike patterns, which are unique to the preceding inputs. Differences in spike patterns at the scale of milliseconds encode differences in the input as long as 200-300 ms. When single bursts contain three or more spikes, the multiple interspike intervals combinatorially encode multiple features of the input.

To address this issue, we examined the division of dentate granule cell progenitors in rats after kainic acid administration, or perforant path kindling. The results indicate that initial limbic seizures trigger the enhancement of dentate progenitor cell division, but progenitor cells may become unreactive to prolonged generalized seizures.

Furthermore, epidemiological studies described that the incidence of cancer was reduced in PD patients. Recent study provides evidences of the inverse relationship of PD and some cancers at the molecular level. For example, loss of neuroprotection of DJ-1 is causative for familial PD, while increased expression of this molecule stimulates oncogenesis. In this context, we show that proteasomal inhibition by \u2423-synuclein, which has been thought as one major pathogenic mechanism for PD, may induce differentiation of cancer cells.

To identify gene mutations that affect AMI, we screened \u223c100 Drosophila lines and found that heterozygous mutants for the PKA catalytic subunit (DC0/+) exhibit robust suppression of AMI without affecting memory at young ages. This result suggests a causal relationship between PKA and AMI. Of particular interest, IGF/PI3K/Akt signaling, which results in decreased GSK3 activity, has also been shown to ameliorate AMI. Both PKA and GSK3 phosphorylate the microtubule-associated protein tau, causing tau aggregation and neurodegeneration. While IGF signaling suppresses activity of GSK3 at young ages, declining IGF levels during aging may increase GSK3 activity in aged animals. In support of this idea, we found suppression of AMI in flies fed GSK3 inhibitors. We hypothesize that similar to the mechanisms occurring in neurodegenerative diseases, tau phosphorylation by PKA and GSK3 causes neuronal dysfunction during normal aging.",

Here, we have isolated and characterized novel estrogenresponsive genes to clarify the molecular mechanism of the estrogen action in target cells using genomic binding-site cloning (GBSC) method. One of the first identified genes is the estrogen-responsive RING finger protein (Efp). Efp expression was observed in uterus, mammary gland and certain regions of the brain where ER is also expressed and positively regulated by estrogen. We revealed that Efp targets proteolysis of 14-3-3 sigma, a negative cell cycle regulator that causes G2 arrest and that Efp is an essential oncogenic factor in breast cancer growth. On the other hand, another gene identified by GBSC is NR2D, an NMDA receptor. This gene was regulated by estrogen in the hypothalamus, together with ER, PR and Efp. These estrogen responsive genes could mediate roles of estrogen action in specific organs, utilizing differential mechanisms as well as sharing common mechanisms.",

To examine it, we recorded responses of 670 inferotemporal cells to 1100 object images in a fixation task. We also conducted psychophysical experiments with monkeys to determine conditions for view-invariant object recognition.

We studied dynamic changes in functional circuitry by analyzing the noise correlations of simultaneously recorded MT neurons in two behavioral contexts: one that promotes cooperative interactions between the two neurons and another that promotes competitive interactions. We created cooperative or competitive contexts by changing the axis of motion of the discrimination task from trial to trial. We found that identical visual stimuli indeed give rise to differences in noise correlation in the two behavioral contexts. Specifically, noise correlations were higher in the cooperative than in the competitive context. This result suggests that MT neurons receive inputs of central origin whose strength changes with the task structure. The changes in correlation appear to reflect differences in how MT neurons are pooled for the purpose of perceptual discrimination, and may derive from higher-level cognitive processes such as feature-based attention.",

Lesion studies suggested that inferior temporal (IT) cortex of the monkey plays a key role in color vision, and we have recently found that color selective neurons are concentrated in a small region in area TE of IT cortex. To study how the color selective responses in this region are affected by the task demands, we trained monkeys a color categorization task and a color discrimination task using the same set of color stimuli, and analyzed how the responses are affected. We found response magnitudes of many neurons changed between two tasks while the color tuning is well reserved. In several extreme cases, large gain change almost completely eliminated the responses in one task.

Infant monkeys were reared for nearly a year in a room where the illumination came from only monochromatic lights. After extensive training, they were able to perform color matching.

It is expressed by folliculostellate (FS) cells in the pituitary gland and by ependymal cells and activated glia in the hypothalamus but not by classical secretory cells. GCs act on cells expressing ANXA1 to cause the translocation of the protein to the plasma membrane at points with particular accumulation at points where the cells make contact with endocrine cells. This process is effected via a non-genomic mechanism and is dependent upon phosphorylation, lipidation and a transport protein, possibly ABCA1. The released protein then acts, via cell surface receptors on the endocrine cells to suppress stimulus-evoked peptide release. The nature of the ANXA1 receptor is unclear but, increasing data suggest that members of the formal peptide receptor family may be important in this regard.",

It is generally accepted that the brain can resolve the order of two stimuli that are separated in time by 30 ms. This applies to temporal order judgment of two tactile stimuli, delivered one to each hand, as long as the arms are uncrossed. However, crossing the arms caused misreporting (that is, inverting) of the temporal order. The reversal was not due to simple confusion of hands, because correct judgment was recovered at longer intervals (e.g., 1.5 s). When the stimuli were delivered to the tips of sticks held in each hand, the judgment was altered by crossing the sticks without changing the spatial locations of the hands. We recently found that temporal order judgments of tactile stimuli are strongly affected by visual distractors and/or eye movements. The results suggest that tactile stimuli are ordered in time only after they are referred to relevant locations in space, where multiple modalities of sensory signals converge.

Insights from spatial neglect and the medial frontal cortex Masud Husain UCL Institute of Neurology, UK Why do we look where we do? Studies in humans show that when we look at a scene, our initial fixation patterns can be predicted to a high degree of accuracy. Our eyes go to the most salient locations where local feature contrast is greatest. These findings have led to the concept of a salience map which directs attention and gaze bottomup. In humans, damage to the right posterior parietal cortex often leads to dramatic neglect of the left side of space. Recent research has begun to unravel the components of this syndrome, demonstrating several underlying mechanisms. These include a disturbance of the salience representation, a failure to keep track of spatial locations across saccades and difficulty in sustaining attention over time. Gaze is directed not only bottom-up by but also top-down by voluntary mechanisms. Our recent investigations of human medial frontal regions reveal important roles for the supplementary eye field and the pre-supplementary motor areas in the control of competing eye movement plans and deciding where to look. Parietal and medial frontal gaze regions appear to play different, complementary roles in controlling why we look where we do.",

Most postsynaptic spines also received an asymmetrical input, called double innervated (DI) spines.

GABAergic inputs were rarely observed in spines innervated by VGLUT1-expressing terminals (n = 289), but were found in-10% of spines innervated also by VGLUT2-expressing terminals (n = 444).

Fast spiking inhibitory cells shared extensive common excitatory inputs with neighboring pyramids only when the pairs of cells were reciprocally connected.

In order to begin to reveal those programs we have recently developed methods for measuring genome-wide gene expression from small numbers (30-50) of fluorescently labeled, hand-sorted neurons. Subsets of pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons were labeled genetically with GFP or anatomically with fluorescent microspheres. Labeled neurons were characterized electrophysiologically and sorted for expression analysis. The resulting expression profiles revealed highly diverse expression of molecules involved in cell-cell signaling and cell-cell adhesion, as well as transcription factors.

Many guidance cues attract or repel the growth cone via asymmetric Ca 2+ signals. Its turning direction depends on the occurrence of Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ release (CICR) through the ryanodine receptor type 3 (RyR3). The activity of RyR3 is controlled by CAMs via cAMP and PKA. In this way, axon-guiding and CAM-derived signals are integrated by RyR3, that serves as a key regulator of axon guidance. Attractive Ca 2+ signals facilitate intracellular membrane transport to the leading front and subsequent VAMP2-mediated exocytosis on the side with elevated Ca 2+ . In contrast, repulsive Ca 2+ signals do not trigger such membrane dynamics. Growth cone attraction, but not repulsion, is prevented by inhibition of VAMP2-mediated exocytosis. The results indicate that growth cone attraction is driven by asymmetric membrane dynamics and that growth cone repulsion is driven by different mechanisms, not simply by changing the left/right polarity of the same molecular machinery.",

The FERM domain-containing GEF, FARP2, associates directly with plexin-A1. Sema3A induces the dissociation of FARP2 from plexin-A1, resulting in activation of FARP2's Rac GEF activity, Rnd1 recruitment to plexin-A1 and down regulation of R-Ras. Simultaneously, the FERM domain of FARP2 sequesters PIPKI\u2425661 from talin, thereby inhibiting its kinase activity. These activities are necessary for Sema3A-mediated repulsion of outgrowing axons. Plexin-A1 also functions as a ligand binding receptor of a transmembrane semaphorin, Sema6D and contributes to cardiac morphogenesis. Sema6D exerts a migration-inhibitory activity on cells from the ventricle and a migration-promoting activity on those from the conotruncal segment.

CRMP-2 links kinesin-1 to tubulin dimmers and Sra-1, and participates in the kinesin-1-dependent transport of tubulin dimmers and the Sra-1/WAVE complex to growing axons.

Results of recent work on phenotypes arising in mice lacking all three Ena/VASP proteins (Mena, VASP, EVL) will be presented. Such animals exhibit a \"cobblestone cortex\" in which groups of neurons migrate beyond the pial membrane. The mutants also contain little if any cortical axonal fiber tracts.

However the origin of this nonlinearity still remains unclear. To investigate the origin for the nonlinearity of BOLD response, we underwent simultaneous measurement of fMRI and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) . Temporal dynamics of the responses in oxy-, deoxy-and total hemoglobin concentrations as well as BOLD signal were simultaneously measured during a visual stimulation with various durations. To quantify the degree of the nonlinearity of responses, we introduced a model using an impulse response function modified with additional nonlinearity scaling. This model was applied to the NIRS measures as well as BOLD responses. The nonlinearity of the response in oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) was also estimated from NIRS measures. The non-linearity of BOLD was almost identical to OEF across the wide range of nonlinearity of the neuronal responses. And hence we conclude that the non-linearity of BOLD responses to the neural activity is mainly due to the nonlinear response of OEF.",

In another series of experiments, we combine EEG with fMRI in order to identify BOLD correlates of neuronal background rhythms such as alpha rhythm, Mu rhythm, etc. In a third series of experiments, we combine fMRI with the measurement of high-frequency oscillations in EEG.

Microglia remove invading microorganisms as well as cell debris that contains hazardous substances such as lysosomal proteases. Brain is particularly vulnerable to the immune and inflammatory attacks and, therefore, has multiple mechanisms that regulate the immune and inflammatory responses more strictly than other organs. Nevertheless, many neurodegenerative lesions are associated with activated microglia and low-grade, but sustained, inflammation. Neuroinflammation is a term that refers to such conditions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), microglia play a central role for phagocytic removal of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) from the brain. The process is enhanced by complement activation. However, these cellular and humoral responses to Abeta may be toxic to neurons in AD. Neuroinflammation could be a double-edged sword in the brain. In patients with neurodegenerative diseases, complication of systemic inflammatory diseases, depletion of some neurotransmitters such as catecholamines, and the presence of brain lesions may adjunctly upregulate neuroinflammation, which further accelerates neuronal degeneration.",

They are thought to be originated from mesoderm, and to be similar cells to other tissue-resident macrophages. Activated microglia have been shown to remove potentially deleterious debris and promote tissue repair by secreting neurotrophic factors at the neuronal injury sites, however, they can release potentially cytotoxic substances in vitro, and at least so-called fully activated form of microglia which are observed at the injury site in AIDS dementia is completely neurotoxic. These suggest that some factor(s) may contribute to change microglial phenotype from protective to toxic, but the detail is not clear. Recently we generated HIV-derived nef protein tranduced microglia. They are found to increase both the potential to produce O2-and MPO-like peroxidase activity resulting in the neurotoxicity. Therefore, the target protein(s) of nef might to be involved in the control of microglial neurotoxicity. There is abundant evidence that extracellular ATP have an important role in pain signaling. The focus of attention now is on the possibility that ATP receptor of microglia might be involved in neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is often a consequence of nerve injury through surgery, bone compression, diabetes or infection. This type of pain state is generally resistant to currently available treatments. We recently reported that the expression of P2X4 receptors in the spinal cord is enhanced in spinal microglia after peripheral nerve injury, and blocking pharmacologically and suppressing molecularly P2X4 receptors produce a reduction of the neuropathic pain behaviour (2003. Nature 424, 778-783) . More recently, we have reported that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) released from microglia by the stimulation of P2X4 causes the depolarizing shift in reversal potential of anion in LI neurons of rats with nerve injury (2005 ( . Nature 438, 1017 ( -1021 . Understanding the key roles of these ATP receptors may lead to new strategies for the management of neuropathic pain.",

The response is thought to be an important step in the pathophysiology of traumatic, inflammatory, neoplastic and degenerative brain disease. Part of the structural and functional plasticity of microglia is the de novo expression of the 18 kDa transposor protein or \"peripheral benzodiazepine binding site\" (PBBS). The PBBS is bound by the isoquinoline PK11195, which labeled with carbon-11 can be used for positron emission tomography (PET). Using 11C-(R)-PK11195 PET in inflammatory and neurodegenerative brain disease as well as receptor autoradiography, we have shown that distributed regional PBBS up-regulation correlates with clinical deficit and mirrors the histologically described activation of microglia in the penumbra of focal lesions, but importantly also in the distant, anterograde and retrograde projection areas of the lesioned neural pathway.",

The serious problem of NIRS imaging is ambiguity in light propagation in the head caused by the scattering of tissue. This poses results in poor spatial resolution and contrast in the image. The development of simulation model to calculate light propagation in the head to deduce the path length in the brain and the spatial sensitivity profile is very important to improve the NIRS imaging. In this study, simulation of light propagation in the head model for NIRS imaging is briefly reviewed. The heterogeneity of the tissues in the head, especially low-scattering cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), has a strong effect on the light propagation in the brain. The sensitivity to concentration change in haemoglobin in the cortical tissue is improved by the effect of the CSF. The simulation of NIRS imaging indicates that the intensity and size of activated region in the functional image depend on the relative position of activated region to fibre pairs.",

Over the past 25 years, many approaches to quantification have been tried, and in the case that Hb concentration changes are global within the tissue, the quantitative accuracy of time-resolved spectroscopy (TRS) and phase-resolved spectroscopy (PRS) has been established. When the changes are localized, however, as with functional brain activation, the difficulty of quantification has not yet been fully overcome because elimination of the effects of hemodynamic changes in the extracerebral tissue is also challenging. The temporal profile of detected light intensity measured by TRS carries information about depth-dependent attenuation, because light that penetrated into deeper positions in the head is detected later. Thus, several time-domain methods to determine absorption changes with depth resolution have been proposed. Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is also a potential technique for quantitative detection of focal changes in cerebral hemodynamics. In this symposium, I will outline these approaches.",

Sensorimotor stimulation by facilitation technique induced enhanced activation in the motor related areas, particularly in the premotor cortex.

Unraveling mechanisms that limit such dramatic plasticity to early life would pave the way for novel paradigms or therapeutic agents for rehabilitation, recovery from injury or improved learning in adulthood. Conversely, a deeper insight into early postnatal brain development will provide valuable inspiration for effective brain-based education methods for our children-perhaps the greatest potential contribution of neuroscience to society. This raises urgent and important ethical questions for our consideration: is there an \"ideal\" brain we should be nurturing? To what extent can/should drugs be used not merely to correct developmental disorders but also to enhance performance? How do we determine what is good or bad for the maturing brain?",

Potential uses of many of these recent advances go beyond their intended medical applications. A growing array of neurotechnologies capable of monitoring or even intervening in human cognition makes it imperative to consider the social, ethical, and legal implications of these scientific advances. While it once might had been possible to conduct research with naive ignorance of its societal implications, this is no longer the case. Moreover, we need to be cognizant that modern brain science is profoundly influenced by the distinct cultural and social values held by different sectors of the world population. We will discuss what can be done from the perspective of funding agencies to facilitate intercultural dialogue, foster mutual understanding, and develop a framework and strategies to address emerging neuroethical issues and prioritize our future efforts in neuroscience research.",

Second, the existence of the spatiotemporal filtering mechanism for the perception of motion speed is shown by the various motion stimuli.

            "text": "Takeo Kubota, Takae Hirasawa, Kaoru Nagai Department of Epigenetic Medicine, University of Yamanashi Faculty of Medicine, Chuo, Yamanashi, Japan How are brains controlled molecularly? This is one of fundamental questions in neuroscience. Several lines of evidences have suggested that genes are more strictly controlled in the brain than in other organs. Epigenetics is one of such systems to control expression of the genes not based on DNA sequence, but based on 'beyond the DNA sequence' (chromatin modifications and small RNAs). The failure of this system is known to result in neurodevelopmental diseases, such as an autistic Rett syndrome. It has recently been demonstrated that the epigenetic system is affected by an environmental stress after birth, and that the system is associated with neural differentiation and cell fate determination and human brain diversity. These findings imply that epigenetics is an important research field to understand mechanisms of neural development and mental diseases. Topics from update epigenetic researches in neuroscience will be discussed in this symposium. As one of epigenetic disorders, we introduce studies of Rett syndrome (RTT) and its model mouse. RTT is a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by mental retardation and peculiar behavior. Mutations of the MeCP2 gene, encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2, cause RTT. MeCP2 acts as a transcriptional silencer. Abnormal expression of some genes due to MeCP2 dysfunction is thought to be the first step of RTT pathophysiology. To understand how MeCP2 mutation makes RTT, we have two approaches that are morphological investigation of brain and discovery of MeCP2-downstream genes. Using mecp2-null mice (mecp2 \u2212/y ), we revealed small number of dendritic spines and premature postsynaptic density at presymptomatic period. Premature synaptogenesis may be the initial neuronal changes of RTT. We also found that MeCP2 directly regulates expression of Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) gene in human and mouse brains. Pathological features of mecp2 \u2212/y have the similarity of IGFBP3 transgenic mice, which show reduction of early postnatal brain growth. Over-expression of IGFBP3 due to lack of MeCP2 may lead to delayed brain maturation. Growing evidence suggests that alterations in the epigenetic status such as DNA methylation and histone modifications in brain are involved in the behavioral response to environmental factors and the pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases. However, in contrast to mRNA profiling, there are few established methods for profiling the genomewide epigenetic status to date. We developed a method for profiling the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern using tiling arrays, and focused our analysis on human brain samples derived from psychiatric patients and control subjects. In this symposium, general picture of the genes that are heavily methylated or non-methylated in human brain, and the relationship between DNA methylation and mRNA expression patterns will be presented. Understanding what produces neuronal diversification has been a longstanding challenge for neuroscientists. The recent finding that Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements-1 or L1 (LINE-1) retroelements are active in somatic neuronal progenitor cells provided an additional mechanism for neuronal diversification. Together with their mutated relatives, retroelements sequences constitute 45% of the mammalian genome with L1 elements alone representing 20%. The fact that L1 can retrotranspose in a defined window of neuronal differentiation, changing the genetic information in single neurons in an arbitrary fashion, allows the brain to develop in distinctly different ways. This characteristic of variety and flexibility may contribute to the uniqueness of an individual brain. However, the extent of the impact of L1 on the neuronal genome is unknown. The characterization of somatic neuronal diversification will not only be relevant for the understanding of brain complexity and neuronal organization in mammals but may also shed light on the differences in cognitive abilities, personality traits and many psychiatric conditions observed in humans.

Sci., NAIST, Ikoma, Japan; 2 Inst. Mol. Embryol. Genet., Kumamoto Univ., Kumamoto, Japan Neurons and astrocytes are generated from common neural stem/precursor cells, however, neurogenesis precedes astrocytogenesis during brain development. We have previously reported that GFAP-positive astrocyte differentiation is dependent on the transcriptional activity of STAT3. A CpG dinucleotide in the STAT3 recognition sequence within the GFAP gene promoter is highly methylated at midgestation which becomes demethylated as the brain develops, enabling STAT3 to induce GFAP expression. Thus, it is conceivable that the epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation of cell type-specific gene promoter controls the switch from neurogenesis to astrocytogenesis in the developing telencephalon. Here we report that neurons, which are generated earlier than astrocytes can potentiate neural precursors at midgenstation to differentiate into astrocyte through the activation of Notch-signaling. The activated Notch-signaling accelerates demethylation of STAT3 binding element in the GFAP gene promoter.",

Gene transfer technique may be applicable to the treatment of serious types of cerebrovascular disease. Cerebral blood vessels have been targeted by gene transfer with intravascular or perivascular approaches. Several experimental studies have revealed potential usefulness of gene therapy for prevention of vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. As for cerebral infarction, studies using various brain ischemia models have shown effectiveness of gene transfer in reduction of infarct size and functional recovery. Our recent studies of post-ischemic gene transfer have provided promising results in attenuation of ischemic damages by inhibiting apoptosis, inflammation and vascular permeability. Approaches to cerebral ischemia using gene transfer for angiogenesis and neurogenesis appear to be novel and promising strategies.

In this presentation, the author will summarize our recent basic research and clinical application reported in the literature. It is now possible to make several types of neurotrophic factor secreting cell line by genetic manipulation. In order to prevent immunological reaction and tumor formation, we have been using encapsulated cell grafting technique. We transplanted several types of neurotrophic factor secreting cell line into the middle cerebral artery occlusion model and could confirm the histological and behavioral efficacy. We have also been using adultderived neural stem cells as donor cells because they have merits to make autografitng possible. As donor tissue, neural protection can be expected similar to fetus-derived neural stem cells. The effect of neural protection increases when neurotrophic factor secreting genes such as GDNF were inserted into neural stem cells. Cell transplantation is considered a new therapeutic approach for cerebral ischemia and clinical application is expected. We now know that (1) motor function may recover after minor injury to the primary motor cortex, (2) this recovery is, at least in part, associated with reorganization of cortical motor representation, (3) the molecular mechanism for synaptic plasticity and axonal regrowth is being elucidated, and (4) recent clinical experience revealed that the motor function in patients with spinal cord injury is improved after transplantation of her/his own olfactory mucosa. Furthermore, recent neuroimaging techniques can display the cortical functions as we as the specific fiber connections in individual brain. Virtually any part of the brain can be approached with the accuracy of millimeters by the current image-guided neurosurgery.

Recently, misfolding has come to be considered one of the primary factors for pQ protein aggregation, although, the nature of misfolding is not yet well known. The protein misfolding induced by pQ expansion was investigated with our molecular model system using mutant myoglobin which is inserted different size of pQ. Expanded polyglutamine stretches form intramolecular and intermolecular beta sheets and amyloid fibrils. The surface of the mutant myoglobin with expanded pQ was partially unfolded and destabilized. We also investigated the early phase of fibrillization by small-angle X-ray scattering and electron microscopic studies, revealing that the expansion of pQ to 50 repeats induced the formation of quasi-aggregate in the earliest stage of the protein fibrillization. This structure could be closely involved in recruitment of various functional proteins into aggregates, leading to the cellular dysfunction that causes pQ diseases. Furthermore using cellular model system we also studied the aggregates interacting proteins (AIPs) by analyzing the purified polyglutamine inclusions and the lists of AIP including chaperones, proteasome subunits, ubiquitin interacting proteins and others suggest the pathological role of AIPs in the disease cascades.",

The Q129 mice exhibited neurological phenotypes similar to juvenile type of DRPLA characterized by ataxia, myoclonus and epilepsy. Electrophysiological studies disclosed age-dependent abnormalities in the globus pallidus and cerebellum. Neuropathological studies revealed progressive brain atrophy without obvious neuronal loss and an age-dependent increase in neuronal intranuclear accumulation of mutant proteins with the regional distribution vulnerable to DRPLA. Expression profiling analyses revealed down-regulated genes including cAMP responsive genes. These results suggest that \"neuronal dysfunction\", but not the \"neuronal cell death\", is the essential mechanism of neurodegeneration in DRPLA. Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat encoding polyglutamine in the huntingtin protein and involves progressive motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Using a transgenic mouse model of HD, we have shown that environmental factors can dramatically modify the disease process and delay the onset and progression of motor and cognitive symptoms. Further, we have attempted to correlate these behavioural findings with changes in gene expression, neuronal morphology, neurogenesis, and cortical plasticity, in an attempt to elucidate cellular and molecular mediators in HD, and understand how gene-environment interactions can modulate these pathogenic pathways. Our findings indicate that the modulatory effects of environmental manipulations are mediated by amelioration of specific molecular and cellular deficits, and provide experimental paradigms for the identification of novel therapeutic targets for HD and related brain disorders.",

We analyzed VZ cells and cells from the intermediate zone (IMZ) mainly composed of migrating cells, and found that the cells had acquired a birth-date-dependent preferential segregation mechanism in a Reelin-independent manner. These findings suggest that cortical neurons acquire a birth-date-dependent segregation property (or fate) before their somas reach the MZ.

To investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying nucleus formation, we analyzed the sequence and pattern of expression of specific markers that distinguish the subsets of neuronal precursors during development of the thalamus. We found that a morphogen-like activity of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) precisely defines positions of neurons with distinct properties, and that some GABAergic interneurons migrate from their birth place to distant nuclei in a highly organized manner. We also provide evidence that Shh produced by the zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI), which abuts the prethalamus and thalamus, is likely to be a cue for this directed migration. Our results suggest that local production of prespecified neurons coupled with distinct migration properties and local guidance cues such as compartment boundaries could be principle elements for the nucleus formation. Layers and nuclei are important functional units in the vertebrate CNS. Neurons in these structures have common physiological and anatomical features. Despite their importance, mechanisms for nucleogenesis are poorly understood. We focused on the lower rhombic lip (lRL)-derived precerebellar neurons, and utilized exo utero electroporation with an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) gene, to study the process of nucleogenesis. After the unilateral transfer of EYFP to the lRL of embryonic day 12.5 mice, EYFP-labelled neurons migrate tangentially from the lRL in two distinct streams, one toward the ventral metencephalon and the other toward the ventral myelencephalon. The former formed the pontine grey nucleus and reticulotegmental nucleus and the latter the external cuneate nucleus and lateral reticular nucleus. Before forming the clusters, the labelled neurons begin to migrate toward the ventricle along the radial fibres, and aggregate as they detach from the fibres. Perturbation experiments such as introduction of dominant negative constructs and siRNA suggested involvement of several molecules in the migration of these neurons. The brains of fetal alcohol syndrome patients exhibit impaired neuronal migration, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying this abnormality. Here we show that Ca 2+ signaling and cyclic nucleotide signaling are the central targets of alcohol action in neuronal cell migration. An acute administration of ethanol reduced the frequency of transient Ca 2+ elevations in migrating neurons and cGMP levels, and increased cAMP levels. Experimental manipulations of these second messenger pathways, through stimulating Ca 2+ and cGMP signaling or inhibiting cAMP signaling, completely reversed the action of ethanol on neuronal migration in vitro as well as in vivo. Each second-messenger has multiple but distinct downstream targets, including CaMKII, calcineurin, PP1, Rho GTPase, MAPK and PI 3 K. These results demonstrate that the aberrant migration of immature neurons in the fetal brain caused by maternal alcohol consumption may be corrected by controlling the activity of these second-messenger pathways.",

Le Bihan SHFJ/CEA, France Among 1905 Einstein papers is one which unexpectedly gave birth to a powerful method to explore the brain. Molecular diffusion was explained by Einstein on the basis of the thermal random translational motion of molecules. In the mid 1980s it was shown that water diffusion in the brain could be imaged using MRI. A dramatic application of diffusion MRI has been brain ischemia, following the discovery that water diffusion drops immediately after the onset of an ischemic event, when brain cells undergo swelling through cytotoxic edema. Also, water diffusion is anisotropic in white matter, because axon membranes limit molecular movement perpendicularly to the fibers. This feature can be exploited to map out the orientation in space of the white matter tracks and image brain connections. More recently, it was discovered that diffusion MRI could detect transient swelling of activated cortical cells. This represents a significant breakthrough, allowing non invasive access to a fast and direct physiological marker of brain activation. This approach will bridge the gap between invasive optical imaging techniques and current functional neuroimaging approaches in humans, which are based on indirect and remote blood flow changes.",

DTI reveals two specific characteristics: diffusion anisotropy; and directional distribution of water diffusivity. White matter shows high diffusion anisotropy, because diffusion is faster in parallel to fiber direction than in other directions. DTI of the brain can be reconstructed to display 3D macroscopic fiber tract architecture, in a process known as fiber tractography. With recent advances in actively shielded 3-T magnets and parallel imaging techniques, high-field MR imaging has become practical in clinical settings. We have demonstrated that depiction of most fiber tracts was improved on 3-T tractography compared to 1.5 T. We have also established an integration of tractography and intraoperative subcortical motor-evoked potential, and demonstrated that diffusion tensor tractography of the corticospinal tract using 3-T MR was able to provide interactive information on fiber tracts, depicting the course of eloquent fiber tracts during an operation. To test whether MR tractography is reproducible and reliable, we used this technique to assess acute tiny infarcts located in the supratentorial brain. We analyzed the data of 14 patients who presented to our institute with sensorimotor symptoms. There was an excellent correlation between the location of the infarct as assessed by tractography and clinical symptoms. Next, we applied the technique to patients with evolving symptoms after admission to hospital. We specifically assessed the change in the tract-infarct relationship over time. The data showed that, in most cases when there was symptomatic progression, the distance between the tract and the infarct border depicted on DWI diminished. Finally, we studied whether the use of tractography could help predict a patient's prognosis. To simplify the analysis, we specifically focused on patients with lenticulostriate artery (LSA) infarcts. We analyzed the correlation between the extent of CST involvement within the infarcts and the severity of motor deficits. The data indicated that the tractographic technique could be useful to predict a patient's outcome.",

The probabilistic tractography provides estimates of the likelihood of a pathway between two brain regions without tensor estimation and thus could trace the fiber pathways beyond regions of low diffusion anisotrophy into the grey matter. However, the results depend merely on anisotropic movement of water molecules and need validation. For presurgical evaluation of epilepsy patients, we developed an in vivo tracking method, cortico-cortical evoked potential, to electrically track the cortico-cortical connections by stimulating a part of the brain through epicortical electrodes and recording the cortical evoked potentials that emanate from a distant region of the cortex via projections. Combined with preoperative diffusion analysis, this invasive evaluation provides a unique opportunity to study the cortico-cortical connectivity both functionally and anatomically. Results of the combined approach will be presented. Parkinson disease (PD) is the second commonest neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer disease characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Pathologically, the most outstanding change is the neurodegeneration of the nigral dopaminergic neurons. Although familial forms of PD can be encountered up to 15% of the patients, the remaining cases are sporadic. It has been postulated that nigral neurodegeneration in PD is induced by the interaction of genetic risk factors and environmental factors. Epidemiological studies revealed numbers of environmental factors that are positively correlated with increased risk of PD; such factors include pesticide, herbicides, rural living, well water drinking, metals such as manganese and iron, fuel oil, industrial chemicals, and hydrocarbon solvents. In addition, certain employments were reported to be associated with increased risk of PD; these include steel/alloy industry, wood/pulp plant, farming, carpentry, cleaning, orchard, mining, and welding. These studies suggest importance of environmental factors in the pathogenesis of PD. Recent progress in these areas will be discussed.",

Thus, we examined the effects of industrial chemicals, called endocrine disruptors, on rat neurodevelopment. Oral administration of an endocrine disruptor (12-60 mg/kg) into male Wistar rats (from 5 days to 3 weeks of age) significantly caused hyperactivity at 4-5 weeks old. Immunohistochemical analyses of the brain tissues at 8 weeks of age revealed a large reduction of immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase, but not for glutamic acid decarboxylase, both of which are localized in the substantia nigra, suggesting the specific degeneration by the chemical of dopaminergic neurons.

If the reversed situation were at hand, we feel that the risk of cellular telephones, base-stations and other RF emitting sources could be managed by reduction of their emitted energy. The SAR value of around 1 mW/kg is exists at a distance of more than one meter away from the mobile phone antenna and at a distance of about 150 -200 meters from a base station. Another remarkable observation in our studies is the fact that a significant (p < 0.002) neuronal damage is seen in rat brains 50 days after a 2 hour exposure to GSM at SAR values 200, 20 and 2 mW/kg.

The mechanisms underlying the preferential degeneration of the striatum, the most striking neuropathological change in Huntington disease, are unknown. The behavioral and anatomical similarities found between Huntington disease and animal models of striatal degeneration using the environmental toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP) support the hypothesis that mitochondrial defects could play a role in Huntington disease. We will discuss the mechanisms of 3NP toxicity and show that 3NP and mutated Huntingtin have certain mechanisms of toxicity in common. In particular, we show that mutated Huntingtin can alter the expression of mitochondrial complex II, the respiratory chain enzyme specifically inhibited by 3NP. In summary, the 3NP story is a good example showing how the study of environmental toxins can greatly help to elucidate the complex mechanisms underlying chronic neurodegenerative disorders. We recently demonstrated that rats received intrecisternal injection of 6-OHDA or environmental chemicals, such as bisphenol A, nonylphenol, p-octylphenol, diethylhexylphthalate or dibutylphthalate, at 5 days of age showed behavioral hyperactivity at 4-5 weeks of age. Immunohistochemical studies revealed a deficit in the development of dopamine (DA) neurons. Adult rats received these chemicals showed degeneration in nigro-striatal DA neurons similarly to Parkinson's disease. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity, using PC12 cells as an in vitro model system. We observed the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and p-quinone via auto-oxidation of 6-OHDA. We also characterized the oxidation of cellular proteins by 6-OHDA and the protective effect of antioxidants such as catalase, glutathione, and n-acetylcysteine with different manner. We will discuss about apoptotic cell death pathway including cytochrome C release and caspase activation induced by 6-OHDA, ROS and p-quinone.",

Jankowsky California Institute of Technology, USA Epidemiological studies indicate that environmental factors significantly influence the risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia. Foremost among those factors are education, occupation, and leisure activities. Although not universal, most studies have found that individuals with greater education, more challenging occupation, or active leisure hobbies show relative protection against dementia. Animal models for Alzheimer's disease have recently been used to explore the mechanism of this effect. Transgenic mice designed to recapitulate Alzheimer's amyloid pathology are protected from functional decline by enriched housing designed to provide cognitive stimulation. Both enriched housing and exercise modify the level of amyloid-beta in the brains of transgenic mice, demonstrating that environmental factors can significantly influence brain biochemistry. Intriguingly, traditional environmental enrichment can improve cognitive behavior while paradoxically elevating amyloid-beta levels in transgenic mice, suggesting that environmental stimulation may alter amyloid metabolism and cognitive function by competing mechanisms. The efficacy of synaptic inhibition depends on the number of GABA A receptors expressed on the neuron surfaces. In the present study, we have elucidated the role of PRIP (PLC-related inactive protein) in trafficking of the receptors by analyzing PRIP knockout (KO) mice; the sensitivity to diazepam was reduced as assessed by biochemical, electrophysiological and behavioral analyses of KO mice, suggesting the dysfunction of the \u24252 subunit-containing receptors. We then examined the mechanisms by which PRIP molecule regulates cellsurface expression of \u24252 subunit-containing receptors. Disruption of the direct interaction between PRIP and the \u2424 subunit of receptors by PRIP-binding peptide inhibited cell-surface expression of \u24252 subunit-containing receptors in GH3 and HEK293 cells. Constitutive internalization of the receptors was also modified by the peptide. Collectively, PRIP molecules are involved in trafficking of \u24252 subunit containing GABA A receptors to/from cell-surface membrane.",

Environ. Med., Nagoya Univ., Nagoya, Japan High-frequency stimulation (HFS) induces long-term potentiation (LTP) at inhibitory synapses of layer 5 pyramidal cells in rat visual cortex. This LTP requires a postsynaptic Ca 2+ rise for induction and spike firing of presynaptic cells for maintenance, although the necessary frequency is low, suggesting that LTP is expressed presynaptically and some information must be sent backwards from the post-to presynaptic cells during induction. In this study, we investigated whether BDNF could act as such retrograde messengers. LTP did not occur when HFS was applied in the presence of K252a at 200 nM, inhibiting Trk receptor tyrosine kinases selectively at that dose. HFS induced LTP when K252a application was started soon after HFS or when K252a was loaded into postsynaptic cells. LTP did not occur in the presence of TrkB-IgG or anti-BDNF antibodies. In cells loaded with BAPTA, the addition of BDNF to the medium enabled HFS to induce LTP without affecting basal synaptic transmission. These results suggest that BDNF released from postsynaptic cells activates presynaptic TrkB, enabling the induction of LTP.",

Duguid University College London, UK In the cerebellum, retrograde signalling is important for the induction of short-and long-term changes to synaptic inhibition at interneuron-Purkinje cell (IN-PC) synapses. Endocannabinoids, via CB1 receptors, mediate a short-term decrease in synaptic efficacy, while glutamate, via presynaptic NMDA receptors, induces a sustained increase in GABA release. We now report that dendritically released glutamate also acts as an autocrine messenger, activating mGluR1 on PCs to enhance synaptic inhibition via the release of endocannabinoids. This process was triggered by repetitive PC stimulation and blocked by uncoupling the mGluR1-Gq/11 transduction pathway as well as being initiated by direct mGluR1 activation during PC depolarisation. Glutamate uptake by excitatory amino acid transporters controlled the extent of autocrine mGluR1 activation, whilst basal glutamate levels were unable to enhance endocannabinoid release. Our study suggests that autocrine mGluR1 activation provides a powerful homeostatic mechanism to dynamically regulate inhibitory synaptic transmission.",

The signaling cascades regulating the induction of RP has been clarified. The balance of activities of protein kinases and phosphatases determines whether RP is induced or not. Here we show another molecular mechanism involved in the RP induction. Using both electrophysiological experiments and computational kinetic simulation of biochemical reactions, we demonstrate how the long-term potentiation of GABA A receptormediated responses is brought about. RP induction was impaired by inhibition of Ca 2+ -activated protease calpain or by disturbance of association of GABA A receptor \u24252 subunit with GABARAP (GABA A receptor associated protein). Binding of GABARAP to microtubule was also involved in the regulation of RP. Our results suggest that structural alteration of GABARAP caused by calpain activity is critical for establishment of RP.",

Second, we demonstrate a newly developed method, brain-machine interface (BMI), to test the reality of cell assembly as neural information and the plastic formation of cell assemblies during learning processes. We introduce our recent BMI system with independent component analysis (ICA) and specific multi-electrodes and show some neuronal and behavioral data obtained by the BMI system. Hebb postulated that coincident activities of pre-and postsynaptic neurons trigger input-specific plasticity. How relevant is it in protein synthesis-dependent late-phase plasticity (LP)? Synaptic tagging hypothesis explains how new proteins reach the activated synapses to establish input-specific LP. Using live-imaging techniques, we measured entry of Vesl-1S-EGFP into dendritic spines (VE trapping) of rat hippocampal neurons in culture, and found that VE trapping activity serves as synaptic tag in many criteria. VE trapping conforms to the Hebb's rule in a sense that it required both presynaptic activity and postsynaptic NO-PKG pathway, but their coincident time window was far wider (\u223ch) than that of early-phase plasticity, suggesting an involvement of persistently synchronized rather than transiently coincident activity. NO spreading from the activated synapses may persistently prime the postsynaptic tag components at the surrounding synapses, during which brief inputs to these synapses will establish associative and heterosynaptic tags. Thus, tagging one synapse would lead surrounding synapses to multiple metaplastic states.",

The input involves the generation of hippocampal rhythm, theta, gamma rhythm. To mimic the system, we applied carbachol, a cholinergic agent, to rat hippocampal slices. Carbachol can induce beta oscillation as well while carbachol can induce theta, and gamma oscillations in the slices. In the present paper, we introduce the beta oscillations. The application of 30 M carbachol induces beta oscillations which occur intermittently with the interval of 20-30 s. During the intervals, gamma oscillations are induced. The mean frequency of the oscillations is 16.9 \u00b1 0.9 Hz (mean \u00b1 S.E.M.). The oscillations are induced via muscarinic M1, 3, 4 receptors. The frequencies of them are significantly decreased by the application of bicuculline, a GABA A antagonist. They are sensitive to bicuculline, while theta oscillations are not. It is indicated that the character of beta oscillations are different from those of theta oscillations. The neocortex and the hippocampus are connected by way of the entorhinal cortex and the subiculum. To examine ongoing network interactions among these distinct cortices during neocortical slow oscillations (1-3 Hz), we recorded intracellular potentials in single neocortical, entorhinal, subicular, and hippocampal neurons, together with hippocampal field and multi-unit activities in adult anesthetized rats. We have found that (1) most entorhinal and subicular neurons displayed bimodal active (up) and quiet (down) states of membrane potential, in synchrony with neocortical slow oscillations, (2) no bimodal up-down transition was present in hippocampal neurons. Hippocampal granule cells were directly driven by entorhinal up-state activity, while CA3 and CA1 neurons discharged during both up and down states, (3) gamma and fast (ripple) oscillations were observed in hippocampal CA1 area irrespective of up-down transition. These observations suggest that entorhinal and subicular regions are \"neocortex-like\" and hippocampal networks can generate self-organized activity independent of neocortical slow oscillations. The cholinergic neurons in the mesopontine reticular formation (MPRF) seem to control sleep-wake cycle and hippocampal activity, because stimulation of the MPRF elicits REM sleep and hippocampal theta wave. In this study, we recorded neuronal activity in the MPRF and pontine and hippocampal EEG during REM sleep and investigated time-relationship between them. Our results are summarized as follows: (1) most of the MPRF neurons were active during REM sleep; (2) the MPRF activity increased over ten seconds before transition from NREM to REM sleep, i.e. from non-theta to theta period;",

By using clock gene expression as a marker of clock functions, we examined the localization and molecular bases of the two oscillators. Rats and mice were housed under light-dark (LD) 18:6 h and LD 6:18 h. Clock gene expression patterns in the entire SCN were examined by in situ hybridization on the first day of constant darkness. The phase relations of Per1 and Per2 rhythms suggest that light-on resets Per1 rhythms in both light conditions, while Per2 rhythm also relates to the light-off. In cultured SCN of transgenic mice expressing luciferase under the control of Per1 promoter, we observed two bioluminescent peaks a day only in the anterior SCN from the mice kept in LD 18:6. The finding suggests that two distinct oscillators, which respond to the day-length, reside in the anterior SCN. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the center of the mammalian circadian clock. Tissue transplantation of the SCN restores the behavioral circadian rhythm in SCN-lesioned mice in spite of the impaired neural connection with the host brain. We have investigated whether grafted SCN regulates the circadian oscillator in peripheral organs using the SCN-transplanted mice that have a limited time information transmission paths. As a result, the grafted SCN restored not only circadian behavior rhythm but also the circadian rhythms of peripheral organs. Many of clock genes showed dynamic oscillations with identical phase relationship as shown in intact animals, however, Per1 and Per2 showed low amplitude of oscillation. The findings suggest that diffusible signal molecules released from the transplanted SCN entrain the circadian clock in peripheral organs and that they differentially modulate the expression of clock genes.",

Adrenal gland is important for circadian regulation for mammalian peripheral clocks. To identify circadian expressed genes regulated by adrenal glands pathways, we performed DNA microarray analysis using hepatic RNA from adrenalectomized (ADX) and sham-operated mice. We identified 169 genes that fluctuated between day and night in the livers, 100 lost circadian rhythmicity in ADX mice. These included the genes for key enzymes of liver metabolic functions such as glucokinase, HMG-CoA reductase, and glucose-6-phosphatase. The present study showed that the circadian expression of mouse liver genes is governed by core components of the circadian clock such as CLOCK, and the other 100 genes depend on adrenal glands pathway such as glucocorticoids.",

Moreover, this gene expression accompanies the surge of plasma and brain corticosterone levels without accompanying activation of the hypothalamoadenohypophysial axis. The abolishment after SCN-lesioning, and the day-night difference of light-induced adrenal gene expression and corticosterone release, clearly indicate that this phenomenon is closely linked to the circadian clock. The surge of plasma corticosterone after light exposure indicates that environmental light signals are instantly converted to glucocorticoid signals in the blood and CSF.

Gene transfer into Purkinje cells is an effective approach for the study of cerebellar function and treatment against cerebellar disorders. Although adenoviral vectors or sindbis vectors are frequently used for gene delivery into neurons, the former has extremely low affinity for Purkinje cells, while the latter causes substantial damage to the infected cells. To achieve effective gene transfer into Purkinje cells, we used human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived lentiviral vectors. Purkinje cells were efficiently transduced without significant influence on the cell viability and synaptic functions. Gene expression was also detected, though less efficiently, in other cortical cells, whereas no transduced cells were observed outside of the cerebellar cortex.

Consequently, various symptoms appear, such as cardinal symptoms, those in the advanced stage and those as the side effects of long-term levodopa therapy. Many antiparkinsonian drugs have been developed, but all of the symptoms are not improved by these drugs. Stereotaxic surgery was started for treating severe tremor and rigidity in the mid-20th century. Stimulation by chronically implanted electrodes in the brain, that is, deep brain stimulation (DBS), has recently been applied and has been shown to have marked effects on the symptoms resisted to conventional treatments. In particular, DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective treatment for the symptoms. Much basic research on the function of STN has been reported, but STN function is still unclear. Clinical outcomes including the side effects of STN DBS, the neural activities recorded from STN and the localization of clinical effects are reported in this paper.

A leading hypothesis regarding the development of movement disorders of basal ganglia origin suggests that hyperkinetic and hypokinetic disorders occur as a result of changes in the mean discharge rate in the GPi and substantia nigra, which in turn suppress thalamocortical output. On the other hand, altered firing patterns in the basal ganglia have been reported in MPTP-induced parkinsonian animals: increases in bursting activity and periodic oscillatory activity in the GPi and STN, and synchronization of GPi, or GPi and striatal neurons. Synchronous oscillation in the basal ganglia may break down independent processing in the motor circuit and disrupt signal processing at the cortical level.",

On the other hand, recent our findings suggest the importance of the direct basal ganglia outflow to the brainstem where fundamental neuronal networks for controlling postural muscle tone and locomotion are located.

Little is yet known, however, regarding characteristics of neuronal activity within the GPi underlying dystonia. We analyzed activity of GPi-neurons in patients with dystonia or Parkinson's disease, which were recorded during surgery for chronic GPi-stimulation. As compared to GPi neurons in patients with Parkinson's disease, GPi neurons in patients with dystonia were distinctive with following three characteristics; firing rate (49.4 \u00b1 31.7 Hz, n = 27) was low, firing pattern was often composed of irregular pauses and bursts, and many were responsive to body movement with wide receptive fields. These findings suggest that dystonia may be related to unstable movement-related sensory processing within the GPi. It has been considered that dystonia, which is generally characterized by postural abnormalities and involuntary movements including torsion, is caused by dysfunction of the basal ganglia. The purpose of the present work is to clarify the neural mechanisms underlying the onset of dystonia by analyzing the pathophysiology of a model for torsion dystonia, wriggle mouse sagami (WMS). The genomic mutation of WMS occurs in the gene encoding plasma membrane Ca 2+ -ATPase isoform 2 that is located on the 6th chromosome. Recent immunohistochemical and electrophysiological investigations on WMS have shown that (1) D2-type dopamine receptors are downregulated presynaptically in the striatum, and (2) a large number of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum express tyrosine hydroxylase (the synthesizing enzyme for dopamine) and their excitability is greatly reduced.

The pulse mode tonically activates gonads in both sexes with being negatively regulated by gonadal steroids. Environmental cues, such as photoperiod or nutrition, are considered to affect reproductive activity through altering pulse mode of GnRH release. Pulse mode seems much more robust than surge, because estrogen can induce a surge under a certain condition when the pulse is suppressed.

The GnRH surge depends on a switch in estradiol (E) feedback from negative to positive and in rodents on time of day, occurring in the PM. Treating ovariectomized (OVX) mice with a constant release E capsule (OVX+E) elicits daily PM LH surges; there is no diurnal change in OVX controls. Likewise, extracellular recordings of firing activity of GFP-identified GnRH neurons showed no diurnal changes in cells from OVX mice. In contrast, E increased firing in the PM compared to AM. GABAergic neurons form a major input to GnRH neurons, and activation of the GABAA receptor can be excitatory in these cells. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of synaptic activation of GABAA receptors on GnRH neurons revealed E-dependent decreases in transmission during the AM (negative feedback) and increases in transmission near surge onset that persisted for some populations of afferents thru the surge peak.

Here, I introduce our recent studies on the physiological properties of neuroendocrine preoptic (POA) GnRH neurons in comparison with the neuromodulatory terminal nerve (TN) GnRH neurons. To study the both types of GnRH neurons, we use a fish model system in which we can easily identify both of them in intact brain preparations in vitro, which is a great advantage over most other vertebrates. The POA-GnRH neurons had quite different basic electrophysiological membrane properties from those of TN-GnRH neurons and showed alternating active and silent phases of firing activities, in contrast to the regular pacemaker activities of TN-GnRH neurons. Now that we have various experimental approaches (electrochemical measurement of GnRH release, Ca 2+ imaging after single-cell electroporation, single-cell RT-PCR, double patch clamp recording, etc.) in hand, simultaneous multidisciplinary approaches should be possible to study the physiology of GnRH neurons.",

Abdominal fat stores are low in dieted, prepubertal female rats with delayed puberty, suggesting that such rats may be particularly sensitive to dietary fuel changes. Such rats are fed a single daily meal and demonstrate decreased blood glucose levels between meals. We hypothesized that such daily hypoglycemic bouts delay onset of puberty during dieting. When glucose supplement was given to prepubertal dieted rats, and they exhibited first estrus with similar timing to previously dieted re-fed rats. Conversely, when dieted rats were re-fed ad libitum and simultaneously glucose-deprived, first estrus was delayed. Blood glucose levels during glucose-supplementation which induced first estrus, and during glucoprivation and re-feeding which delayed first estrus, were similarly elevated, suggesting that central, rather than peripheral, glucose levels are monitored in the prepubertal animal. In summary, central glucose availability may be an important signal timing puberty onset.",

The action is mainly exerted by controlling gene expression through binding to its specific receptor, TH receptors (TRs). TRs are ligand-regulated transcription factors that are expressed in many organs, including brain. TRs bind to target DNA sequences known as TH-response element (TRE). Coactivators and corepressors are involved in the TR-mediated gene regulation through histone modification. We characterized the coactivator and the corepressor that were expressed in embryo brain. Although precise mechanism of the TH action for brain development has not been fully clarified, these cofactors may be involved in these actions. TH affects brain development only during a limited period, which is referred as the critical period of TH action. Recently, it has been speculated that environmental chemicals may cause the abnormal brain development. Possible mechanism of action of such chemicals on TR system will be discussed.",

They are initially identified as part of detoxification system in the body, and involved in the tissue uptake of xenobiotics, especially amphipathic organic anions. Some members accept a variety of structurally unrelated compounds as substrate. Oatp1c1 is characterized by its unique substrate specificity, highly selective for thyroid hormones, particularly for T4 and reverse T3, but the transport activity of T3 is quite low. It is predominantly expressed in the brain capillaries and choroid plexus, acting as barrier of central nervous system, where Oatp1a4, the transport activities of T4 and T3 are similar, is also expressed. The uptake of T4 and T3 by the brain determined using in situ brain perfusion technique was saturable and inhibited by OATPs substrates and inhibitors.

In this presentation, based on comprehensive DNA microarray analysis, we demonstrate alterations in gene expression in the brain of neonatal rats perinatally exposed to 4-hydroxy-2,2 ,3 ,4 ,5pentachlorobiphenyl (anti-thyroid hormone-like), as well as in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons exposed to 4-hydroxy-2,2 ,3,4 ,5,5 ,6-heptachlorobiphenyl (thyroid hormone-like). Among genes whose mRNA expression levels were affected by these compounds, a number of genes essential for the establishment of synaptic networks were detected, suggesting that long-lasting effects on higher brain functions may result from exposure of the developing brain to these compounds. Hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs (OH-PCBs) have chemical structures similar to thyroid hormones (THs). We reported that low doses of two types of OH-PCB inhibited TH-dependent extension of Purkinje cell dendrites (2005. Dev. Brain Res. 154, 259) . Koibuchi et al. (2004) clarified that they interfere with TH-dependent gene expressions in reporter gene assays. Further, Takasuga et al. (2004) detected some PCB and OH-PCB congeners in human CSF, of which 4OH-CB187 is the highest concentration. To determine its effects on developing neurons, we examined 4OH-CB187 in rodent cerebellar culture cells. Interestingly, 4OH-CB187 promoted dendritic development of Purkinje cells in the absence of TH and increased significantly their survival numbers. These results indicate that OH-PCB congeners may disrupt normal brain development by different mechanisms depending on their chemical structures.",

In PTU rats, the delay in migration of the extragranular cells of cerebellum, and in innervation from inferior olive nuclei to Purkinje cells were shown. These neurons transiently expressed serotonin-IR, therefore we treated SSRI or 5-HTP to examine the relevance of serotoninergic function. The treatment of 5-HTP but not SSRI recovered the delay of cell migration. These effects of serotonin manipulation in PTU rats on the behavioral impairment and the development of CNS will be discussed. It is hoped that embryonic stem (ES) cells will be used in transplantation therapy for neurological diseases. However, because grafts of neural stem cells derived from ES cells may contain residual undifferentiated cells, there would be a risk for teratomas. To reduce this risk, we applied to ES cells herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene and ganciclovir (GCV) treatment. Stable mouse and cynomolgus monkey ES cell lines expressing HSV-tk were obtained. GCV sensitivity was higher in undifferentiated ES cells than in ES cell-derived neural stem cells. ES cell-derived neurons were resistant to GCV treatment. Nude mice with transplants of undifferentiated ES cells expressing HSV-tk formed teratomas, but the tumor growth was suppressed after the GCV treatment. Suicide gene delivery might increase the safety of the use of ES cells in cell replacement therapy. Enzymatic degradation of chondroitin sulfate is known to promote axonal regeneration in the central nervous system. The physiological role of chondroitin sulfate up-regulated after injury was examined in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system which was unilaterally transected and treated with chondroitinase ABC. In transected mice, dopaminergic axons did not extend across the lesion. Chondroitin sulfate was up-regulated around the lesion and a fibrotic scar containing type IV collagen deposits were developed in the lesion center. In chondroitinase ABC-treated mice, numerous dopaminergic axons were regenerated across the lesion. In these animals, chondroitin sulfate immunoreactivity was remarkably decreased and the formation of a fibrotic scar was unexpectedly prevented. These results support our previous supposition that chondroitin sulfate does not act as an obstacle to regenerating axons, but involved in the repair process of the brain injury including the formation of the fibrotic scar (Kawano et al., 2005) .",

There was no significant difference in dipole amplitudes between M140 elicited by the original songs and that by the modified ones.

The semantic distance was decided by the numbers of links of the semantic network of the taxonomic layer in a Japanese thesaurus. The words for mammalians were grouped into five semantic categories in the thesaurus. The heads of the animals were changed with those from another semantic category (Deviant, d = 4), and with those from an inner semantic category (Middle, d = 2), while others were not changed (Normal, d = 0). Peak amplitudes of waveforms of the root mean square values on the components of 170 ms (F (2/38) = 4.92, p = 0.013) and 220 ms (F (2/38) = 5.23, p = 0.0098) were significantly decreased with increments of the semantic distance in left occipital sensors. The gradient of the decreasing line of the amplitudes of the 170 and 220 ms components indicated the capability of extracting the structure of a typical prototype of the form of the animal.

To visualize the activity of signaling pathways in neurons deep in brain tissues, we have combined fluorescence lifetime measurements and two-photon microscopy.

The Ca 2+ permeability of NMDAR is regulated by phosphorylation of its tyrosine residues. We report here that activin, a member of the transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) superfamily, and one of proteins synthesised after LTP, promotes phosphorylation of NMDARs and increases the Ca 2+ influx through those receptors in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons. This signal transduction occurs in a functional complex of activin receptors, NMDARs, and Src family tyrosine kinase, Fyn formed on a multimer of postsynaptic scaffolding PDZ protein, activin receptor interacting protein 1 (ARIP1). Activin-induced NMDAR activation persists more than 24 h, which is complimentary to the transient activation of NMDARs by brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF).

CaMKI activation requires phosphorylation of Thr177 by CaMKK as an upstream kinase. We here documented a marked increase in CaMKI-alpha-Thr177 phosphorylation following LTP induction in rat hippocampal CA1 region. Like CaMKII activation following LTP (Fukunaga et al., 1993) , the increased CaMKI-Thr177 phosphorylation remained elevated at least for 60 min after LTP induction. The increased CaMKI-Thr177 phosphorylation was closely associated with prolonged increases in phosphorylation of CREB and myosin light chains in the CA1 region. This is in contrast with transient increases in CaMKIV and ERK phosphorylation. Treatment with CaMKK inhibitor, STO-609 significantly inhibited both CREB and MLC phosphorylation with concomitant reduction of LTP in the CA1 region. Taken together, CaMKI likely mediates the late phase of CREB phosphorylation and an increased MLC phosphorylation in the hippocampal LTP. To investigate how the excitatory postsynaptic inputs of the proximal dendrite effect the information processing of synaptic inputs at the distal dendrite, stimulation was applied to induce BAP and EPSP at the alveus and the proximal dendrite, respectively. The resulting coincidence of magnitude of BAP and EPSP at the distal dendrite was enhanced when the BAP was delivered at a timing (5 ms) to induce LTP. Furthermore, the magnitude of BAP at the distal dendrite was attenuated by the input from the proximal dendrite at a timing (20 ms) to induce LTD. These results suggest that the magnitude of BAP delivered to the distal dendrite can be amplified or attenuated depending on the relative timing between proximal input and BAP. This may be due to an effect on the coding process at the distal dendrite and could support the basis for a novel learning rule in the brain.",

Here, we developed novel mutant mice in which PDGFR-\u2424 subunit gene was genetically deleted in the neurons of CNS to elucidate the role of PDGFR-\u2424. Our mutant mice reached adulthood without apparent anatomical defects. The cerebral damage after cryogenic injury was severely exacerbated in the mutants compared with the controls. Furthermore, this exacerbated lesion formation was suggested to be, at least partly, due to the enhanced excitotoxicity after injury, because NMDA-induced lesion formation was also extensively enhanced in the cerebral cortex of the mutants without altered NMDA receptor expression. This is the first known report to address the postnatal function of PDGFR-\u2424 expressed in CNS neurons, using genetically engineered mutant. It was clearly demonstrated that PDGFR-\u2424 expressed in neuron protects CNS neurons from cryogenic injury and NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. Early postnatal days (especially the first three weeks in the rat) are the critical period for newborn hippocampal granule cells (GCs) to dynamically migrate from the dentate hilus and form the GC layer. To investigate the mechanism that regulates newborn GC migration, we developed a new slice coculture system. The hilar parts of entorhino-hippocampal slices prepared from postnatal six-day-old (P6) rats that had received a single BrdU injection at P5 were substituted with the corresponding region of entorhino-hippocampal slices from P6 rats. After five days in vitro, newborn GCs, detected by BrdU and Prox1, migrated out of the hilar graft and reached the host GC layer. Chronic application of picrotoxin, a GABA A receptor antagonist, facilitated the migration of newborn GCs into the GC layer. These results indicate that GABA A receptors regulate the migration of newborn GCs in early postnatal days.",

To examine a possibility that neural activity is involved in the translocation, firing activity of cultured neurons was examined using multi-electrode dishes. As a result, spontaneous firing activity was prominent in the late stages when cytoplasmic translocation occurred. However, TTX addition to the culture medium produced the inverse translocation.

Junction conductance (maximum 2.45 nS) was measured. In high-voltage electron microscopy (Hitachi1250M, NIPS, 2005 , gap junctions (average size 0.86 m long) were present in contacts. In confocal laser-scanning imaging, connexin36 localization at contacts counted gap junctions (seven sites in a pair on average).

The presence of seven junctions between a pair will lead to estimate a total junction of 315 nS. The measured conductance could allow to estimate a fraction of open channels as 0.8%.

The luminance contrast of the target presented in the intact hemifield was reduced so that the detectability was comparable to that in the affected hemifield (80-90% correct). In the saccades to the affected hemifield, the curvature of the trajectories was smaller and the deviation of the saccadic end points from the target was larger than those to the intact hemifield. These results suggest that without geniculo-striate pathway, online compensation for the variation of the initial saccadic command is not fully functional, thus leading to inaccurate saccades. We propose that the residual visuomotor processing of monkeys with V1 lesion is unlike normal, near-threshold vision.",

Here, we studied the angle selectivity of area V1, which is the major source of inputs to area V2. We conducted single-unit recordings from the superficial layer of area V1, while animals performed a fixation task. For comparison, we used a similar stimulus set. The stimuli were much larger than the size of the classical receptive fields. Area V1 neurons responded mainly to sharp angles (30 \u2022 ), straight lines (180 \u2022 ) or right corners (90 \u2022 ), but not to intermediate angles (60 \u2022 or 120 \u2022 angle width). This contrasted with area V2, where neurons showed a variety of the optimal angle width including intermediate angles. We also observed several V1 neurons showed fine orientation tuning to short line segments, while weak or no responses were induced by a set of large angle stimuli. We suggest that area V1 neurons largely contribute to representing line components (lines and line-ends) and to sending such information to area V2.",

Single unit analysis showed that firing rate of individual neuron was strongly dependent on the luminance intensity of stimulation. However, population activity of ganglion cells usually showed particular spatiotemporal pattern, in response to a specific velocity of the moving bar. Differing from single direction-selective ganglion cell (DSGC), which responds to its preferred direction of movement by firing at its maximal rate, population activity of non-direction-selective ganglion cells may encode the motion information in a temporally ranked manner, independent to their individual firing rates. These results suggest that an efficient and economical coding mechanism may be employed by the retina, where the firing rate of individual neurons and spatiotemporal pattern of population neuronal responses could act in parallel to encode different aspects of visual information.",

We found that many voxels that are weighted heavily in the classifier analysis and carry similar orientation biases closely follow draining veins that are visible on T2*-weighted venograms.

Intrinsic signal imaging was performed in exposed TE, under anesthesia, during presentations of visual object stimuli. This resulted in multiple optical spots evoked by each stimulus. In some animals, subsequently, unit recording was carried out at multiple sites within the imaged region. Then, an anterograde tracer was injected into one of the spots. Both optical imaging and unit recording revealed regions with stimulus preference similar to that at the injection site. However, these regions and the injection site were not always connected by horizontal axons. Some regions sharing a preference to particular stimuli were connected, even though they showed different preferences to the other stimuli. These results suggest that horizontal axons can connect regions with different stimulus preferences in TE, in contrast to like-to-like connectivity, as understood in early visual cortices. We recorded single cell responses from the inferotemporal cortex of a fixating monkey while visual stimuli with various durations (18-350 ms; ISI = 1 s) were presented. Presentation of visual stimuli at all of the tested durations resulted in prolonged responses. The brief presentations evoked multiple phasic responses while the long presentations evoked sustained activities. There was a significant difference in average firing rate of late phase (350-550 ms) of response to optimal stimulus across presentation durations. But no such differences were found for the first phase (70-270 ms). In addition, the optimal stimulus evoked significantly different response magnitudes in the first and second phase particularly in the short presentation durations. But the suboptimal stimulus (\u223c50% of max response) evoked similar response magnitudes in the first and second phase. These results suggest that stimulus selectivity of inferotemporal cells depends on the stimulus presentation duration and the time window that is used to measure the firing rate.",

The estimation was done by comparison of VA before and after the treatment. Results: Four eyes showed more than one octave improvement of VA. The logMAR average of the four was 0.03, improved from 0.50. The residual five eyes showed less or no improvement. The change of logMAR average was from 0.15 to 0.08.

In a Scottish family, the chromosome translocation interrupts the coding sequence of DISC1. DISC1 is reported to interact with NUDEL, which forms a complex with LIS1. Although the functional significance of this complex in axon growth and neuronal development has been reported, the transport mechanism of the complex into axons and the functions of DISC1 remain largely unknown. Here we report that DISC1 interacted with Kinesin-1, a motor protein of anterograde axonal transport. Kinesin-1 interacted with the NUDEL/LIS1 complex through DISC1, and these molecules accumulated at the distal part of axons. The knockdown of DISC1 by RNAi of DISC1 induced the delocalization of NUDEL and LIS1 from the axons and reduced axonal growth. The knockdown of Kinesin-1 induced the delocalization of DISC1 from the axons. Taken together, these results indicate that DISC1 links Kinesin-1 to the NUDEL/LIS1 complex and regulates its transport as a cargo receptor for axon elongation.",

Certain kinds of receptors are transported from the nerve cell body to the axon terminal, and participate in the recognition of extracellular environments. However, the mechanism of controlled recruitment of receptors remains unsolved. Here, we report that synaptotagmin-like protein 1 (Slp1) can mediate the vesicle transport. Slp1 is known to associate with Rab27. We found that Slp1 associates with collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), which is a key regulator of axon formation. Slp1 could form the trimeric complex with Rab27B and CRMP-2, and also associate with Kinesin-1 through CRMP-2. Slp1 is accumulated on microtubules at the axonal growth cones, and is co-localized with a receptor of growth factor. These findings suggest that Slp1 functions as a mediator of recruitment of certain receptor depending on CRMP-2 and Kinesin-1.",

In this study, by using a H 2 O 2 microsensor, we investigated the level of H 2 O 2 in the brain that altered the permeability of bbb. The microsensor was implanted in the rat's brain and operated amperometrically. We measured H 2 O 2 level from the current generated by the electron transfer at the electrode. We observed a change in permeability when external H 2 O 2 was injected into the brain. Fatality occurs when the injected H 2 O 2 exceeds 250 M.

In central nervous system (CNS) intact rats, stimulation of the T9-11 spinal afferent nerve produced early and late A-reflex discharges, and a late C-reflex discharge. After spinalization at the third thoracic level, stimulation of the same spinal afferent nerve produced an A-reflex with the same latency as the early A-reflex in CNS-intact rats and an early C-reflex discharge with the similar latency as the late A-reflex in CNS-intact rats. On the other hand, stimulation of the tibial afferent nerve produced late A-reflex and C-reflex discharges in CNS intact rats, those were not observed after spinalization. It was concluded that ovarian sympathetic Aand C-reflex discharges evoked by stimulation of a segmental spinal afferent nerve in CNS-intact rats are of spinal and supraspinal origin, and those evoked by tibial nerve stimulation are of supraspinal origin.",

GnRH neurons must be able to continuously fire in response to depolarizing stimuli. For this type of firing, GnRH neurons may have a certain intrinsic property. To address this issue, we investigated the Ca 2+ -activated voltage-independent K + currents underlying afterhyperpolarization. Dispersed GnRH neurons from adult GnRH-EGFP transgenic rats were cultured overnight and used for an electrophysiological experiment with perforated patch clamp configuration. The GnRH neurons showed a slow afterhyperpolarization current (I sAHP ). In contrast to previous reports, the I sAHP observed in rat GnRH neurons was potently blocked by an SK channel blocker apamin. In current clamp condition, GnRH neurons evoked a train of action potentials to depolarizing current pulse. Apamin increased the susceptibility to spike failure. The results indicate that rat GnRH neurons exhibit an apaminsensitive I sAHP , which regulates the firing pattern.",

Also, it is pointed out that the decline of T and EST accelerates depression. Therefore the treatment such as Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) has been tried to cure depression and Alzheimer's disease. However, It has been pointed out that HRT has serious side effects. On the other hand, there are reports that music influences on a steroid hormone. In addition, it is known that music has certain therapeutic gain toward AD and dementia. In this study, from a point of view of the prevention of AD and dementia, we examined the effect of music to sex hormones of normal elderly person. Four males and 36 females participated music session and T and EST were evaluated. As a result, in female, in the high hormone group, the values decreased after the session, and in the low hormone group, the values increased. From above, there might be possibility that through a steroid hormone music participates in protection and improvement of function on brain. Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most common form of chronic infection of the central nervous system. Despite the magnitude of the problem, the general diagnostic outlook is discouraging. This study identifies a specific protein marker in CSF, which will be useful in early diagnosis of TBM. We have demonstrated the presence of a 30-kDa protein band in CSF of 100% (n = 5) of confirmed and 90% (n = 138) of suspected TBM patients out of 153 TBM patients. The 30-kDa protein band was analyzed by LC-MS/MS analysis. In the present study we have identified two mycobacterial proteins Rv3804c (Ag85A) and Rv1886c (Ag 85B) and one host derived protein as the components of the TBM specific 30-kDa protein. Involvement of mitochondrial extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in dopaminergic neurodegeneration was tested in rotenone-and MPP + -induced rat models of Parkinson\u01d0s disease (PD). HPLC-EC, patch clamp, fluorimetry, immunoblot and RT-PCR were used for measuring neurotransmitters/free radicals, membrane currents, caspases activities, levels of proteins and mRNA of mitochondria-linked signaling in brain. We report here a retrograde mode of neuronal death via mitochondrial intrinsic pathway in MPP + -, but an extrinsic mode of cell death in rotenone-induced model. Drug screening in these models (l-deprenyl as positive control) indicated that quercetin, coenzyme Q 10 , Vitamin D 3 and melatonin act via interfering the signaling events in neurons. Loss of complex-I and -IV activities and changes in some of the protein subunits in PD postmortem brains were confirmed in PD and control cybrids. Results from the present study provide evidences for a direct involvement of mitochondria and are suggestive of existence of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in dopaminergic neuronal death.",

Here, we found that PGD 2 induced neuronal apoptosis in rat cortical cultures. However, a PGD 2 receptor blocker did not suppress neurotoxicity of PGD 2 . Little PGD 2 receptor was detected, suggesting an involvement of PGD 2 metabolites in the apoptosis. Among PGD 2 metabolites, 15-deoxy-12,14 -prostaglandin J 2 (15d-12,14 -PGJ 2 ) caused neuronal apoptosis most potently and rapidly. Although 15d-12,14 -PGJ 2 is an endogenous ligand for peroxysome proliferator-activated receptor \u2425 (PPAR\u2425), PPAR\u2425 activators did not kill neurons, suggesting that 15d-12,14 -PGJ 2 induces apoptosis independently of PPAR\u2425 activation. We found specific binding sites of [ 3 H]15d-12,14 -PGJ 2 (JBS) in plasma membranes. There was a close correlation between the neurotoxicity of various eicosanoids and their affinity for JBS. In conclusion, we demonstrated that PGD 2 induced apoptosis via 15d-12,14 -PGJ 2 in rat cortical neurons, and suggested that JBS in the plasma membrane was involved in the 15d-12,14 -PGJ 2 -induced apoptosis.",

We reported last year that bilateral sternocleidomastoid muscles (SCM) of drivers showed a symmetrical increase in activity during forward acceleration of a vehicle. In the present study, we analyzed the relationship between SCM activity and vehicle acceleration. EMGs of the right and left SCM of drivers were recorded during rapid forward acceleration. The time course of the rectified, smoothed EMGs did not match that of vehicle acceleration. For a given acceleration, EMG was larger when acceleration was increasing than when it was decreasing. We compared EMGs and a linear sum of acceleration and its time derivative, jerk. With optimal weights for the two variables and a proper time lag, the linear sum reproduced the EMG profile. The optimal weight and lag varied across subjects and vehicles. We suggest that the jerk-related muscle activity may be necessary to quickly restore proper head position after sudden acceleration. Grasping is a highly developed movement in primate including human. In contrast to the well-known involvement of cerebral cortex, role of spinal neurons in controlling this behavior has never been examined. Here, we show the first direct evidence suggesting the significant contribution of spinal neurons. We trained Japanese monkeys to perform the precision grip task, pinching the two springloaded levers with their index finger and thumb, and recorded neural activities through an oval recording chamber implanted over the cervical spinal cord (C6 to T1). Majority of the recorded neurons showed movement-related modulation of firing rate, and the modulation sometimes started before movement onset. Spike-triggered averaging of muscle activities revealed some neurons had post-spike effects to hand muscles, suggesting that spinal neurons were capable to generate and modulate muscle force during precision grip. We suggest that primate spinal neurons have a significant role in preparation and execution of grasping movement.",

However, no equivalent compartmentalization has been known in the cerebellar nuclei. We mapped aldolase C labeling of terminals of Purkinje cell axons and anterograde labeling of collaterals of olivocerebellar axons in the rat cerebellar nuclei. The cerebellar nuclei were divided into the caudoventral aldolase C-positive and rostrodorsal negative parts, indicating Purkinje cells in the positive and negative stripes in the cortex project to the caudoventral and rostrodorsal parts in the nuclei, respectively. Olivonuclear projections showed clear topography within these parts, which was completely congruent with the olivocortical topography. These results clarified the compartmentalization of the cerebellar nuclei and supported that the aldolase C expression is tightly related with the functional organization of the cerebellum. We examined a context dependency of neuronal activity of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTN) in monkeys during visually guided saccade tasks. About half of movement-related activities occurred for only the saccades to the saccade target in the task, but they did not occur for the saccades outside the task. On the other hand, for the other half of neurons, movement-related activities occurred for every saccade regardless of the task condition. For visual responses, some neurons responded either the initial fixation point or saccade target, and others responded equally to both stimuli. We further analyzed mutual relationship among modulation timing, preferred direction, effect of reward expectation and this context dependency of the activities, and discussed the visuo-motor processing of PPTN. In the reinforcement learning theory, the midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons send reward prediction error signal to the striatum. The cholinergic pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTN) is one of the strongest excitatory input sources to DA neurons. We hypothesized that PPTN may play an important role for relaying necessary components of reward prediction error signals to DA neurons. During recording of PPTN neurons, we utilized reward predictable visually guided saccade tasks where a shape of fixation point indicated a reward volume. For more than half of the neurons, which showed cue related responses, the cue responses were dependent on association of cue feature and reward size. From another population, we recorded reward related activity. In conclusion, PPTN neurons may relay both reward and reward prediction signals, sufficient for computation of reward prediction error.",

            "text": "To act properly in our daily life, the ability to detect and predict timing of events is always required. How do we deal with timing in the brain? To address this question, we trained two Japanese monkeys to perform a visually guided saccadic eye movement task in which the monkeys made saccades to each of 16 targets following a gosignal given at a random timing between 500 and 800 ms after the appearance of the target. We recorded neuronal activity from the supplementary eye field (SEF) during the task. We found a group of cells that showed activity related to the length of the delay period from target-on to the go-signal. These cells were classified into two types: (1) those that showed buildup activity during the delay period until the go-signal, and (2) those that displayed changed activity after the go-signal in relation to the length of the delay period. The results suggest that SEF is involved in timing the onset of the go-signal during the saccadic eye movement task. In reaching, a spatial visuomotor transformation should occur in our brain. We can make the transformation not only when the relationship between visual and motor coordinates is default, but also when a gain for the relationship is changed, for example, in a microsurgery. We trained monkeys to make reaching movements when visuospatially identical targets were presented on a computer display by aligning a cursor that indicated their hand position, while the gain was systematically changed. We recorded and analyzed movement-related neuronal activity in the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and the primary motor cortex (MI) during reaction time. It was revealed that a majority of the MI neurons and a part of the PMv neurons showed activity changes depending on executed movement direction, amplitude, and velocity, whereas a number of the PMv neurons exhibited activity consistent to the visual location of the targets, but not to motor parameters such as amplitude and velocity. The results indicate that the PMv contributes to gain control of reaching during visuomotor transformation. Local oscillatory changes in the human sensorimotor cortex induced by simple motor tasks were investigated using supragyral and intrasulcal surface electrodes which was temporarily implanted for the treatment of intractable deafferentation pain. Time frequency spectrogram and coherence between electrodes revealed that, before and after several hundred milliseconds of the motor execution, the coherence in the premotor cortex increased cooperatively between neighboring electrodes but that the coherence in the intrasulcal primary sensorimotor cortex decreased exclusively. This result reflects that the premotor cortex plays a role in motor planning with diffuse network while the primary motor cortex plays a role in selective motor execution with local motor output unit. The human sensorimotor processing may be hierarchical and similar to an artificial neural computer. We have shown that the trigeminal oral nucleus (Vor) neurons with the receptive field in the intraoral structures project bilaterally to either the jaw-closing (JC) or jaw-opening (JO) motor nucleus in the cat. It is known that neurons in the somatosensory cortex project to the trigeminal sensory nuclei in the rat. Thus, we conducted this study to reveal whether there are Vor neurons that receive cortical projections and project to the JC or JO nucleus in the rat. We injected a retrograde tracer, Fluorogold (FG), in the Vor, and found many retrogradely labeled neurons in the contralateral rostral primary somatosensory cortex (SI). Thus, we injected an anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextranamine (BDA), in the rostral SI, and also FG in the JC or JO nucleus in the same animals. We found a considerable number of FG-labeled Vor neurons made contact with BDA-labeled axon terminals. These results suggest that SI neurons control jawreflexes through Vor neurons.",

To investigate how the fast escape is established during early developmental stages, we examined motor performance of the escape in zebrafish embryos or larvae, and the contribution of Mcell activity on the behavior. The rostral portion of the zebrafish, 30-200 h post fertilization (hpf), was embedded in agar and the tail flip in response to water pulse applied to the head was examined. Thirty hpf embryos, in which M-cell has already received trigeminal nerve innervation and is still extending its axon in the spinal cord, showed tail flips contralateral to the stimulated side with longer latency (>9 ms) than larvae (>80 hpf, 3 ms). M-cell activity monitored with confocal Ca 2+ imaging during the tail flip (>80 hpf) tightly correlated with the initiation of fast escape, whereas delayed escapes without M-cell firing appeared in some cases (<25%) after 100 hpf. Thus, the development of the escape behavior coincided with that of M-cell circuit. Junctophilins (JPs) expressed in the ER/SR interacts with plasma membrane thereby constructing junctional membrane complexes (JMC). We here report that lacking neural JPs subtypes exhibit an irregular hindlimb reflex and impaired memory. To define neural mechanism of memory deficit in JP-DKO mice, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recording of hippocampal neurons. In wild mice, an obvious afterhyperpolarization (AHP) was observed and its AHP was totally blocked by apamin. By contrast, AHP was absent in the JP-DKO mice and was insensitive to apamin treatment. The ER Ca 2+ release through ryanodine receptors, triggered by glutamate receptor-mediated Ca 2+ influx, is essential for the activation of SK channels toward AHP generation in the hippocampal neurons. Therefore, JP-mediated JMC formation likely plays an essential role in neural excitability underlying neural plasticity and memory.",

The mushroom bodies of insect brains are essential in associative olfactory learning. Here we show that the Drosophila larval mushroom body calyx, the dendritic region, is organized in about 34 glomeruli, which we have mapped. Individual glomeruli receive specific innervation from second order olfactory neurons. By contrast, they contain dendrites from hundreds of mushroom body neurons (Kenyon cells), which show low specificity for individual glomeruli. Glomeruli therefore potentially transmit specific sensory inputs to a large fraction of Kenyon cells. Quantitative analysis of dendritic termini of single larval-born Kenyon cells suggests that they arborize in about 6 glomeruli in an apparently random manner.",

By recording field EPSP (fEPSP) along 80 m interval lattice in the spinal gray matter in response to the stimulation of deep cortical layer, we evaluated spatial distribution of synapse formation quantitatively. fEPSPs were recorded diffusely throughout the spinal gray matter at 7-8 DIV, then the amplitudes of fEPSPs in the ventral side began to decrease at 9-10 DIV, and dominated in the dorsal area at 14 DIV. CS axon terminals labeled anterogradely with biocytin distributed diffusely throughout the spinal gray matter at 7-9 DIV but the axons terminals in the ventral area were eliminated until 14 DIV. This synapse elimination from the ventral side was blocked by APV application from 6 DIV, indicating that this process is also NMDA-dependent. In slice coculture study, we showed that corticospinal (CS) axons grow rapidly and reach the ventral spinal gray until 7 DIV. The number of those ventral axons is reduced before 14 DIV. To study the behavior of the CS axons at the single axonal level, we transfected a small number of cortical neurons with EYFP expression vector pCAG-EYFP by way of electroporation to visualize them and took the time-lapse images of their axons under the confocal microscope equipped with an on-stage CO2 incubator. Some axons showed rapid growth, reaching the ventral most part of the spinal gray matter already at 6 DIV. Some axons had collaterals at the dorsal part and retracted the ventral branch while extending the dorsal branch during 7-11 DIV. Some ventral axons showed a fragmented tip during retraction, which was indicative of axonal pruning. These observations provide direct evidence that there are early CS axons that once reach the ventral spinal gray and then retract to stay dorsally. We identified CLICK-III/CaMKI\u2425 as a novel brain-enriched isoform of the CaMK-I family that was lipid-anchored by multiple lipid modifications, prenylation and palmitoylation, resulting in enrichment of CLICK-III into lipid rafts fractions. In situ hybridization revealed the abundant presence of CLICK-III transcript throughout the central nervous system in mouse embryos. To test the role of CLICK-III during early neuritogenesis, a shRNA vector specific for CLICK-III was delivered into dissociated cortical culture. We found that knock-down of CLICK-III resulted in significant decrease in the number and total length of dendrites. Results from introduction of CLICK-III into a CLICK-III-null context confirmed this finding. Surprisingly, lipid modifications of CLICK-III seemed to contribute to fully elicit such an effect. We thus uncovered a novel signaling mechanism by which lipid raft insertion and local activation of a CaMK can be efficiently coupled to actin cytoskeletal signaling during dendritogenesis.",

Here we show that these class specific differences in dendrite arbor morphology are controlled by a combinatorial code of transcription factors. We have developed a system to label individual dendrite arbors then subsequently identify them in electron microscopic sections. Using this method we illustrate that the dendrites of class I neurons, with a simple arbor, contain a high density parallel array of microtubules; on the other hand class IV neurons, with a complex arbor, contain a low density meshwork of microtubules. We are presently investigating how these differences in ultrastructure are controlled by the transcription factors making up the combinatorial code.",

By conditional inactivation, we found that early expression of Hoxa2 in r2 is required for pathfinding and positioning of trigeminal nerve afferents. At later stages, Hoxa2 expression in PrV neurons provides instructive cues for topographic arborization of maxillary axons. Moreover, while PrV neurons appeared normally specified, loss of Hoxa2 function resulted in selective loss of Eph4 expression, and altered axonal projections from PrV to the ventral posterior medial (VPM) nucleus of the thalamus, and absence of a postnatal whisker map at any level of the neuraxis. Thus, Hoxa2 dependent cues are required to determine the territory for whisker representation in r3 and the assembly of a somatosensory circuit.",

In the present study we further studied the subsequent developmental time course of CS terminal distribution. CS axons were anterogradely labeled by injection of biotin dextrane (BDA) into the sensorimotor cortex. The number of the terminals began to increase from P12, reaching peak around the third postnatal week. Labeling of single or a few by microinjection axons revealed that at P14 some additional CS axon branches appeared within the dorsal column of the target spinal segment and further ramified after entering the gray matter. However, the number of axons did not increase in the brainstem and the upper cervical cord.

Proteomics is a powerful strategy for identifying the protein composition in a given cell or a subcellular compartment, and the application of this method to the growth cone should help us solve the above question. We obtained the whole growth cone (GCP) obtained from neonatal rat forebrain and the membrane subfraction of the GCP (GCM), and then those fractions were analyzed using proteomics. We have identified several hundreds of the distinct proteins of these fractions. Here, we show the profiling of GCP and GCM, and will discuss the overview of these protein profiles in relation to the growth cone functions.

The pain in the MM was assessed by the pressure pain threshold (PPT) defined as the amount of pressure required to induce head flinching. The MM injection of \u2423,\u2424-meATP (P2X 1,3,2/3 Rspecific agonist) significantly enhanced the behavioral response to the pressure. This enhanced response was completely blocked by the co-application of \u2423,\u2424-meATP with PPADS (P2X 1,2,3,5,1/5,4/5 R-specific antagonist). Excessive muscular contraction of MM produced by the electrical stimulation significantly decreased the PPT indicating mechanical hyperalgesia of the MM. Administration of PPADS to the exerted MM produced a complete recovery of decreased PPT. P2X 3 Rpositive neurons innervating the exerted MM increased in trigeminal ganglia. Our results suggest that P2X 3 R plays an important role in pressure pain, and mechanical hyperalgesia caused by excessive muscular contraction of MM. The present study was undertaken to investigate the change in the activation of the nociceptive neuronal circuit under a neuropathic pain-like state. Here we found sciatic nerve ligation (SNL) produced a marked increase in the number of c-fos-positive cells in the periaqueductal gray (PAG). Using the fluoro-gold (FG) microinjection into the PAG, numerous FG-labeled cells were detected in the hypothalamus. In the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus, the immunoreactivity (IR) for an excitatory neuronal maker, fosB was increased, whereas the \u2424-endorphin (\u2424-EP)-IR was decreased 7 days after SNL. Furthermore, the subpopulations of \u2424-EP-positive cells were co-labeled with fosB in the ARC. The present data suggest that the hypothalamus can be received by SNL-induced concomitant nociceptive signals, leading to continuous activation of neurons projecting to the PAG. This phenomenon, in turn, indirectly controls pain transmission in the dorsal horn through the descending antinociceptive pathway.",

This prediction includes an attractor dynamics expected in the associative network, which was proposed by many authors, since Marr's theory of simple memory in the hippocampus. However, our mathematical model is too abstract to describe physiological feature of neurons. Then, we have tried to find Cantor-like patterns experimentally from the CA1 pyramidal neurons. Temporally associated and non-associated electrical stimulations were delivered to Schaffer collaterals, and membrane potentials were recorded by patch-clamp recording method. In our results, Cantor-like patterns were observed in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Young songbirds shape their songs using memorized tutor songs and auditory-vocal feedback. We prevented zebra finches from hearing their own vocalizations by exposure to loud noise after 35 days of age, before which they had been reared with song tutors from birth. When the noise stopped at 102-200 days of age, the birds sang unstable and noisy song syllables that did not resemble the tutor syllables. The similarity to the tutor syllables steadily increased until the time of song crystallization (30 days later). These findings show that the memory of tutor syllables still exists well beyond the normal age of song crystallization (d90 of age) and that zebra finches can develop songs using the memory well after the normal period of song development. The temporal order of syllables resembled the tutor model only in birds released from the noise before 80 days of age. Thus, different schedules and processes may govern the learning of syllable phonology and syntax. In addition to well-characterized areas, a novel adult neurogenic region; the temporal germinal layer (TGL) was identified in rats (Takemura, 2005) . A tracer study revealed that there is an interconnection between the dorsal part of the TGL and the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, suggesting a functional implementation of TGL neurogenesis in amygdala-dependent emotional memory processing. To investigate this possibility, we performed a TGL region-specific low-dose irradiation, which can selectively kill proliferating cells and hence can reduce neurogenesis, using a gamma knife. The TGL-irradiated rats expressed a significantly increased tone-related long-term fear memory, indicating a functional significance of the TGL neurogenesis for aversive memory reduction. We (Tsukada and Pan, 2005) systematically examine the functional difference between spatio-temporal learning rule (STLR) proposed by Tsukada (1996) and Hebbian learning rules in a single-layered neural network, computing their ability to differentiate spatiotemporal sequence.",

Tsuda and Kuroda proposed a mathematical model for the Cantor coding in the hippocampal CA1. They also predicted chaotically transitory dynamic behavior called chaotic itinerancy in the hippocampal CA3. This prediction includes an attractor dynamics expected in the associative network, which was proposed by Marr and others. The time series of events, which could be output from CA3, may be encoded in CA1 in an efficient way. The proposed Cantor coding is effective, because the topology of time series is naturally measured on the Cantor set since each element of Cantor set represents a single time series. However, our mathematical model is too abstract to describe physiological feature of neurons. Then, we have tried to make more realistic model of CA1, using 2-compartment model of neuron, and we found the Cantor coding of information of time series in the model CA1. It is known that neurons can propagate action potentials with high temporal precision. However, it is unclear how precisely closely neighbouring neurons synchronize and whether they can code information. Here we show that sub-millisecond synchronization can code information as well as the discharge rate modulation. We found that closely neighbouring pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus synchronize with sub-millisecond precision. The optimal frequency bands for transmitting these synchronizations matched the beta, gamma and fast-ripple oscillations. Moreover, we found that the synchronizations were commonly coupled with rate modulations in relation to both internal (retention and comparison) and external (stimulus and motor) events. The synchronization often occurred in relation to stimulus inputs even when rate modulation was clearly absent. Therefore, our results suggest that sub-millisecond synchronization plays an important role in propagating information in the hippocampus. The alterations of cerebral motor function by chronic ischemia are poorly understood, since no motor symptoms are noticeable in most of the cases. We evaluated spatial distribution and intensity of eventrelated desynchronization of beta band (beta-ERD) evoked in motor area using synthetic aperture magnetometry in 15 patients with chronic ischemia due to diverse vascular occlusive diseases (n = 12) and moyamoya disease (n = 3). Contrary to the normal motor activation, ipsilateral beta-ERD was dominant during grasping task of affected hand in 8 patients. This abnormal activation was obscured by self-paced finger tapping requiring more selective hand motor programming. And it was more frequently observed in the atherosclerotic hypoperfusion (with white matter change) than in other pathogenesis. Ipsilateral beta-ERD may be a new indicator of subclinical functional alteration in motor cortices caused by chronic ischemia.",

Its activity is modulated by phosphorylation, translocation and proteolytic cleavage. We investigated effects of hypothermia on \u2426PKC activation using a rat permanent distal MCA occlusion model. Mild hypothermia (30 \u2022 C) reduced infarct size by 84%. Western blots indicated that \u2426PKC cleavage increased markedly in ischemic core but moderately in penumbra after stroke, which is suppressed by hypothermia (p < 0.05). p-\u2426PKC (T505) dephosphorylated after stroke; this effect is blocked by hypothermia. Full-length and cleaved form \u2426PKC as well as p-\u2426PKC (S643) translocate from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria and nucleus, which is suppressed by hypothermia. \u2426PKC activator suppressed the protective effect of hypothermia. Taken together, hypothermia blocks \u2426PKC activation after focal ischemia. This effect might contribute to hypothermic neuroprotection. Calcium responses in situ following ischemia remain unclear. We sought to determine, in rats, the calcium changes following transient forebrain ischemia. In anesthetized adult rats, 4-vessle occlusion was induced. Fluo-3/AM was microinjected, and the fiber-coupled confocal microscope [imaging fiber bundle coupled to the microlensattached Nipkow-disk scanner (CSU-21, Yokogawa, Japan) equipped with 10\u00d7 objective lens] was inserted into the brain. 4-vessle occlusion induced comparable ischemia in both hippocampus and frontal cortex. Fluorescence intensity of fluo-3 increased up to 115%, and persistently increased up to 130% during 20-min reperfusion, indicating the long-lasting Ca 2+ increase in the CA1 region. In contrast, in the frontal cortex, 10-min ischemia increased fluorescence intensity during ischemia but not reperfusion.

MRI revealed clear signal changes attributable to Resovist-containing microglia in A\u2424-injected areas. This study demonstrates the usefulness of MRI for non-invasive monitoring of exogenous microglia, and suggests a promising future for microglia as therapeutic tools for AD. Extravasation of protease-activated receptor (PAR) activators, such as thrombin, into brain parenchyma can occur after blood-brain barrier breakdown in a number of CNS disorders, which causes pathophysiological changes in neurons and glial cells. To elucidate the mechanism of thrombin-induced activation of astroglial cells, we used 1321N1 astrocytomas that show a characteristic retraction of bipolar protrusions after activation of PARs with thrombin. The thrombin-induced morphological change of 1321N1 cells was inhibited by an inhibitor of IP 3 receptors, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) or an endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase inhibitor, cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). In parallel, thrombin-induced mobilization of Ca 2+ was inhibited by 2-APB and CPA. Moreover, removal of external Ca 2+ accelerated the reversal of thrombin effects. These results suggest that refilling of Ca 2+ store by Ca 2+ entry play an important role in the cytoskeletal dynamics of astroglial cells. To clarify the occurrence range of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), we reexamined an autopsied Alzheimer patient with the onset at age 38 and a 25-year-clinical course. The brain showed severe atrophy (630 g). Microscopic examination disclosed that all telencephalic neocortices had NFT of more than 100 and SP of more than 10. All limbic cortices and nuclei had NFT of more than 100 and SP of more than 10. Although there was no SP, various numbers of NFT were observed in the following structures: claustrum 85, caudate 9, globus pallidus 6, hypothalamus 22, Meynert's nucleus 4, thalamus 74, substantia nigra 6, central gray 12, locus ceruleus 6, Purkinje cells 0, posterior root ganglion 0, adrenal medulla 3. This study revealed that there exist NFT-rich neurons and free neurons. The latter includes Purkinje cells and posterior root ganglion cells.",

In aging mice brain, AR mRNA expression was measured by RT-PCR, AR promoter methylation by Southern hybridization, and proteins binding to promoter by EMSA. AR mRNA level was significantly higher in male than female, and it was downregulated by testosterone, but upregulated by estradiol in adult mice. Female mice exhibited higher methylation of AR promoter than males. Methylation was increased by testosterone, but decreased by estradiol. Furthermore, DNaseI accessibility to AR promoter was reduced in males, increased by gonadectomy but reduced by sex steroids in adult male. Incubation of brain nuclear extract with 32Plabeled AR promoter yielded three specific complexes. The intensity of these complexes varied with age and sex. These findings show that AR mRNA expression and promoter methylation are inversely regulated by sex steroids in the adult mice cerebral cortex. Such regulation of AR expression might influence androgen action and consequently brain function during aging. Reliability of synaptic transmission depends on the efficiency of transmitter removal from the synaptic cleft, as well as on the release machinery and the postsynaptic response mechanism. It has been shown in various synapses that postsynaptic and glial excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) contribute to glutamate removal. However, the role of presynaptic EAATs remains unclear. Using mouse retinal slices, we examined the contribution of EAATs at the rod to rod bipolar cell (RBC) synapse. The kinetics of the RBC current evoked by electrical stimulation of rods was slowed by pharmacological blockade of EAATs. Recordings of the evoked RBC currents from EAAT subtype-deficient mice and the EAAT-coupled anion current revealed that functional EAATs are localized to rod terminals but not to postsynaptic or glial cells. Model simulations suggest that rod EAATs are densely packed near the release site, and that rods are equipped with an almost self-sufficient glutamate recollecting system. TRPV4 is a thermosensitive TRP channel, and activated by body temperature. We found functional-TRPV4 was expressed in soma, dendrites and synapses in the neurons. Since TRPV4 was firstly cloned as an osmotically activated channel, we hypothesized TRPV4 might be involved in volume regulation of the spines. Therefore, we quantified the spine volume changes by glutamate stimulation, and confirmed TRPV4 expression related to the volume increase of spines. Next, we compared the resting membrane potential (RMP) between wild type and TRPV4-deficient neurons at 37 \u2022 C, and found RMP in wild type was more depolarized by approximately 5 mV than RMP in TRPV4-deficient neurons. We also performed current-injection experiments in both neurons, and found that TRPV4-deficient neurons required much bigger currents to get their firing. Thus, we conclude that TRPV4 is involved in regulation of both neural activity and spine motility in hippocampus.",

Our system is capable of patterned photorelease of caged neurotransmitters at 100 locations per 200 ms with submicron resolution. Ultraviolet laser light is steered by galvano-mirrors and projected onto the surface of preparations for uncaging the caged chemicals.

Their functions, however, remain largely unknown. We tried to develop a method enabling to inhibit gene expression in the sensory ganglia in vivo by RNAi and to evaluate its effect on the synaptic transmission in the brain slices. For this purpose, we selected the nodose ganglion (NG), in which the neurons sending glutamatergic projections to the nucleus tractus solitarii in the brainstem, are located. In anesthetized young Wistar rats, synthetic siRNA against the genes coding adenosine A 1 receptors (adora1) was introduced to the NG by electroporation. One to five days after siRNA delivery, the expression level of adora1 in the NG decreased by >90% of that in the non-treated NG, being not accompanied by a change in mRNA level for A 2A receptors. This technique might be promising in analyzing the function of specific molecules involved in transmitter release regulation at the brain synapses. NMDA-receptors are specific constituents of glutamatergic system in brain responsible for molecular mechanisms of recognition and learning. Activation of neurons by NMDA results in intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reorganization of cell metabolism. Exposure of rodent and human lymphocytes with NMDA results in ROS increase within the cells which is suppressed by NMDA antagonists. Moreover we have demonstrated by rt-PCR technique and by using anti-NMDA-antibodies the expression of NMDAreceptors on lymphocyte membranes. In addition, we shown that NMDA receptor dependent signal from lymphocyte membrane is transformed into specific intracellular reactions controlling caspase-3 activity and interferon-\u2425 synthesis. In the presentation, properties of NMDA-receptors and their functional role in immunnocompetent system are discussed. Small molecule G-protein Arf1 in combination with phospholipase D (PLD) is essential for intracellular trafficking of the proteins from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus. However, it is recently reported that it also regulate ionic channel activity at the cytoplasmic membrane. To examine possible involvement of Arf and subsequent PLD in regulation of receptor-induced responses in neurons, we recorded K + -current response to dopamine (DA) in the ganglion cells of Aplysia under conventional two-electrode voltage clamp. Intracellular application of Arf1 blockers such as brefeldin A, Exo1, and Arf1 N-terminal peptide, markedly suppressed the DA-induced response. Furthermore, intracellular application of \u2423-synuclein, a specific blocker of PLD, significantly depressed the K + -current response to DA. These results suggest that Arf1 and subsequent PLD may regulate the K + -current response induced by DA.",

However, the signaling pathways that link NMDAR activity to the postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton are poorly understood. We identified a brain-enriched RhoGAP, p250GAP, which interacts with the NR2B subunit of NMDAR. Within neurons, p250GAP was highly concentrated in the postsynaptic density and co-localized with NR2B and an actin-binding protein, cortactin. p250GAP promoted GTP hydrolysis of Cdc42 and RhoA in vitro and in vivo. NMDAR stimulation led to de-phosphorylation and redistribution of p250GAP. When over-expressed in dissociated neuron, p250GAP suppressed the activities of Rho GTPases, which resulted in spine elongation. Taken together, the results suggest that p250GAP is likely to be involved in NMDAR activity-dependent actin re-organization in spines.",

Many single neuron simulation runs need to be performed first before extracting macroscopic features by statistically averaging. Unlike this method, the Fokker-Planck (FP) method directly evaluates the macroscopic features, thereby giving a clearer insight into function achievable with neuronal population. Despite the lasting interests in firing correlation in coding and conveying information, theoretical studies on it have been largely confined to complicated simulation studies.

In a subset of V4 neurons, we analyzed responses to various combinations of binocular disparity and spatial frequency by using 2-D filtered noise stereograms.

We recorded single unit activity from V4 while a monkey was engaged in a fine stereoscopic depth discrimination or stereoacuity task. The monkey was trained to report by saccadic eye movement whether the center region of a random-dot stereogram was nearer or farther than its immediate surround. Trial-to-trial fluctuation of visual responses of V4 neurons was correlated with the monkey's subsequent behavioral choice.

Cognitive Neurosci., Osaka Univ., Japan The early visual system computes disparity energy of stereo images. Some of the next stages retain this information, while other stages perform further computation to solve the stereo correspondence problem. We addressed how the energy and correspondence computations underlie stereopsis. We asked human subjects to discriminate depth of random-dot stereograms with various amounts of disparity. At each disparity level, we manipulated the proportion of dots with the same luminance contrast between the two eyes by reversing the contrast of some dots in one eye. At small disparities, the proportion of correct choices increased monotonically from chance to perfect as the proportion of the same-contrast dots was increased. At large disparities, the subjects perceived reversed depth when contrastreversed dots dominated, and the proportion of correct choices reached only chance level when the two types of dots were balanced. The results suggest that the correspondence and energy computations underlie fine and coarse stereopsis, respectively. We introduce a novel receptive field (RF) analysis, LSRC, which can reveal various aspects of visual receptive fields that were undetectable previously in a single measurement. The visual stimuli are standard wide-field 2-D ternary dynamic random noise, generally refreshed every 26-40 ms. Unlike the conventional reverse correlation which computes a spike-triggered average (STA) of the stimuli themselves, LSRC computes the STA of the spectra of localized regions of the stimuli. Both simulations and recordings from cat V1/V2 neurons demonstrate that LSRC is capable of revealing details of complex cell RFs, cross-orientation suppression, variations of orientation tuning within RFs that might lead to shape selectivites. Since the stimuli can cover a wide visual field area, and few assumptions are made regarding specific shapes or features in stimuli, LSRC is highly suitable for multi-neuron, multi-area studies spanning retina, V1, and especially areas beyond.",

Stimulus slightly larger than the CRF caused suppression in early response (<100 ms) but not in middle (100-200 ms) and late responses (200-500 ms). As stimulus size was further enlarged, the middle and late responses were remarkably suppressed while the early response was only moderately or weakly suppressed. Radius of surround suppressive field progressively expanded in temporal sequence from 2.5 deg (early response) to 5 deg (middle response) and 7.5 deg (late response). Thus, modulation of early response seems to reflect whether stimulus is larger than CRF size or not, and late response to reflect how wide area is stimulated.",

First, we stimulated CRF and SRF simultaneously (Stimulus-onset-asynchrony (SOA) = 0) and analyzed time course of surround suppression. SF tuning of the surround suppression changed along time course of response, and effective SF of surround suppression shifted from the SF lower than that optimal for CRF response (C-SF) to that near C-SF. Next, changing SOA, we examined surround suppression on different temporal phases of CRF response. SOA-dependency of surround suppression changed according to the temporal phase of response.

In this study, we examined how temporal frequency (TF) of grating stimulus affects size-tuning properties of cat V1 neurons. Our results showed that, when the TF was higher than the optimal, the strength of surround suppression became weak and receptive field size became larger, suggesting that V1 neurons change their spatial property according to TF in such a way that neurons integrate wide visual field for fast moving stimulus, whereas localized field for slow stimulus. We also tested the effect of changing stimulus size on TF tuning curve. Consistent with above-mentioned results, large grating made the peak and the high cut-off of TF-tuning curve higher than those for small grating. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), we obtained basically similar results to those of V1 neurons, suggesting that the subcortical TF tuning property contributes to that in V1.",

            "text": "Ryo Sasaki, Takanori Uka Department of Physiology (I), Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan A few studies have shown that basic tuning functions in early visual cortex change during visual perceptual learning (Schoups et al. 2001; Yang and Maunsell 2004) . The change in neuronal sensitivity in these studies, however, is small compared to the improvement in behavioral sensitivity. Here we hypothesized that the read out of information from sensitive neurons was modified by learning. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether learning modifies neuronal sensitivity or read out of middle temporal (MT) neurons during learning of a depth discrimination task. Two monkeys were trained to report the depth of moving dots (NEAR or FAR), and we recorded from isolated MT neurons during the course of training. The monkeys showed improvement in discrimination thresholds across 70 daily sessions. In contrast, the sensitivity of MT neurons did not change, whereas the correlation between neuronal activity and the monkey's behavioral choice increased during the course of training. These results suggest that plasticity due to perceptual learning occurs within the neural pathway following area MT. We developed an in vivo method to localize the fine tip of a glassinsulated tungsten microelectrode for chronic recording using 4.7 T MRI. The scan conditions were first optimized by imaging a microelectrode that was sunk into copper sulfate solution. The microelectrode tip was precisely localized up to a resolution of 50 m under particular geometrical scan condition. We then examined the applicability of the method in vivo under this optimized scan condition in the temporal cortices of three monkeys. The microelectrode was penetrated into the dorsal or ventral bank of the superior temporal sulcus and the tip was localized by the high-resolution MRI. The accuracy of this method was validated by comparing the localized positions of the microelectrode tips with the corresponding electrolytic lesion marks in histological sections. A transient signal change in diffusion-weighted image of the brain has been detected in human visual cortex. The time course of this signal was ahead of the BOLD signal and characterized by a steep onset. Diffusion-MRI thus represents a new exciting mechanism for fMRI. In order to increase its efficiency we aimed at defining a diffusion response function (DRF) as a counterpart of the hemodynamic response function (HRF). An volume of interest was defined using SPM with a boxcar function. Gamma-variate functions were used to model the steep onset. The parameters of the DRF were estimated by fitting the time-course with the DRF convolved with a boxcar. Although the magnitude of the signal change (around 1%) was smaller than that of BOLD (>2%), the temporal profile showed a constant precedence of the diffusion signal by 2.4s.",

            "text": "The registration of functional brain data to the common brain space offers great advantages for inter-modal data integration and sharing. However, this is difficult to achieve in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) because fNIRS data is primary obtained from the head surface and lacks structural information of the measured brain. Therefore, we present a method for probabilistic registration of fNIRS data to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template through international 10-20 system without using the subject's magnetic resonance image (MRI). The standard deviation in probabilistic registration thus performed for given head surface points is approximately within 1 cm. This means that if the spatial registration error is within an acceptable tolerance limit, it is possible to perform multisubject fNIRS analysis to make inference at the population level and to provide information on positional variability in the population, even when subjects' MRIs are not available. Stochastic perturbation in scale is a basic property of biological systems and generates scale-independent structuration and functional dynamics in spatial and temporal patterns, which can be characterized by fractal dimensionality. It allows a user-independent evaluation and does not rely on subjective evaluation in image assessment. We have used a box-counting algorithm in scale-space segmented images to determine the mass fractal dimension of ventricles in different neurological disorders. Three groups of subjects [Alzheimer disease (AD), Obstructive Hydrocephalus (OH) and Normal controls] were examined. Mass fractal dimension is high for AD (1.33), approaching unity (\u223c1.02) for OH, and in between for control (1.14). Statistical analysis was performed and significant differences were observed for these groups (p < 0.01). The observations are accounted by a flow dynamics heterogeneity model. The implications are that stochastic structuration and fractal dimension may be useful to track temporal progression of disease and assess therapeutic management. Thrombin, a serine protease essential for blood coagulation, also plays an important role in injury associated with intracerebral hemorrhage. In this study, we revealed that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways contribute to thrombin-induced brain injury in two experimental models. Firstly, we employed organotypic cortico-striatal slice cultures. Application of thrombin to slice cultures resulted in cortical neuronal injury and striatal shrinkage. The cortical neuronal injury was ameliorated by inhibition of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) but not p38 MAPK, while the striatal shrinkage was prevented by both of them. Secondly, thrombin was injected into rat striatum. Thrombin-induced brain injury determined by immunoreactivity of neuronal marker was reduced by inhibition of ERK and p38 MAPK. These results suggest that MAPK pathways play important roles in thrombin-induced brain injury and they should be therapeutic targets against neurodegeneration associated with blood-brain barrier destruction. Positron emission tomography was used to study brain activations during motor imagery of standing and during performance of standing posture in Parkinson's disease (PD). Eight PD patients performed mental and motor tasks: (1) resting, (2) staring at a standing human object, (3) thinking of standing, (4) standing with eyes open, (5) standing with eyes closed. Regional CBF data analyzed by SPM2 were compared with normal counterparts. The cerebellar vermis was more activated during imagination of standing in the PD group than in healthy group. As seen in healthy subjects, standing also activated the primary sensorimotor foot area and cerebellar vermis in PD patients, but the between-group comparison generated greater activations in the vermis and prevuneus in PD. The cerebellar vermis engages in postural balance both in mind and reality, and the precuneus may play a more important role in postural control in PD.",

Sch. Medicine, Kyoto Univ., Kyoto, Japan; 2 Grad. Sch. Informatics, Kyoto Univ., Kyoto, Japan Some auditory neurons, such as the owl's Nucleus Laminaris (NL) cells, can sense very high frequency signals (up to 8 kHz). From the theoretical point of view, it seems exceptionally difficult to handle these high frequency signals because the membrane time constant is far longer. First, we discuss a biophysical mechanism of shifting the membrane time constant by connecting the large cell body (soma) with the small node of Ranvier. Next, we discuss the effect of sodium channel distribution on the impedance function of the membrane. Sodium conductance in the soma amplifies low frequency signal components below 1kHz, while that in the node does up to 10 kHz. Last, as a typical example, we discuss the capability of high frequency signal processing in the owl's NL neuron. Some biological evidences indicate that sodium channels in the NL neuron are distributed mainly in the nodes but less in the soma. By using an NL neuron model, we show that a neuron with low somatic sodium conductance and high nodal sodium conductance can achieve fine sensitivity to high frequency signals. Interaural time difference (ITD) is calulated using axonal delay lines and coincidence detector neurons (nucleus laminaris:NL). However, little is known about the cellular mechanisms of coincidence detection. Here, we report the results of in vivo intracellular recordings from the barn owl's NL. We used coaxial glass electrodes in which one (microelectrode) was inserted into a patch-electrode type capillary. The inner sharp electrode was protected by the outer one during penetration of the cerebellum. We isolated 140 NL cells from 16 owls and achieved intracellular recordings in 38 of them, as judged by a sudden DC potential drop and the resting membrane potential (mean Rp = 58 \u00b1 17 mV). NL neurons produced small spikes and oscillatory potentials whose waveform closely resembled the superposition of the tones delivered to the two ears (Sound Analogue PSPs:SAP). The amplitude of SAPs varied as a function of ITD. Spike rates changed in linear proportion to the amplitude of SAP. We evaluated sound localization ability of vision impaired and sighted persons by using a 'two-sound sources discrimination test' in a semianechoic darkroom. In total, 13 vision impaired (7 blind and 6 low vision) and 15 sighted persons participated. The stimuli were pure tone pulses. For each trial, the same single sound pulse was emitted consecutively from a pair of speakers with the same angle either left or right from the midline of the subject. Localization ability was assessed whether the subjects are able to discriminate two sound sources or not in each trial. The discriminability of the blind subjects slightly exceeded that of sighted subjects but the difference was not significant. The discriminability of the low vision subjects, on the other hand, was significantly lower than that of blind or sighted. It was suggested that a peculiar 'object perception' of blind persons is not able to measure by means of 'two-sound sources discrimination test.'",

To study the role of BMP signaling in vivo, we disrupted Bmpr1a, one of the type I receptors for BMPs, in a telencephalic neuronal stem cell-specific manner. We found that aberrant architecture of microvessels that led to a failure in maintaining the blood-brainbarrier in the mutant mice. Although mutant mice showed inflammation around the cortical microvessels, proliferation of hypertrophic reactive-astrocytes in the mutant mice was attenuated. Disruption of astroglial Bmpr1a expression by Cre-adenovirus recapitulates the same phenomena. BMPs were upregulated in reactive astrocytes in after brain injury. Knocking down of Bmpr1a by small interfering RNA in primary astrocytic culture negatively affected their astrocytic growth injured by scratch, which reinforced the importance of autocrine BMP signaling in astrocytes. This result opens up the understanding of novel mechanisms underlying the autocrine BMP signaling on glial scarring after CNS injury. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the functional role of the glial cells in the induction of stress. Here, we found that aging mice promoted anxiety-like behaviors as characterized by both the light-dark and elevated plus-maze tests, and they exhibit an increase in astrocytes in the cingulate cortex. A robust increase in GFAP-positive astrocytes was noted in the cingulate cortex of nerve-ligated mice that exhibited the anxiety-like behavior. In contrast, Iba1-positive microglial cells were dramatically increased as compared to that in control mice and some of them were co-localized with BrdU-like immunoreactivity in the hippocampus of mice exposed to chronic psychological stress. Our results indicate that the increase in astrocyte or microglia in the cingulate cortex or hippocampus may lead to emotional disorders including aggravated anxiety under aging, chronic pain-like state or exposure to chronic psychological stress.",

The dmX precursors are born near the floor plate, migrate dorso-laterally and then are accumulated at the defined position. In the towhead mutant embryos, ectopic neurons are distributed between bilateral dmX where precursors aberrantly migrate in dorsal direction and fail to stop at the right position. Positional cloning and mRNA rescue analysis identified TOWHEAD as a GDP-mannose 4,6 dehydratase (GMDS), a key enzyme for de novo synthesis of a GDP-fucose. As a result, the mutant embryos showed exclusive reduction of fucosylated glycans. Our findings represent that fucosylation is responsible for maturation of these neurons. In development of the Drosophila visual center, photoreceptor cells extend their axons (R axons) to the lamina ganglion layer and trigger proliferation and differentiation of synaptic partners (lamina neurons) by delivering the inductive signal, Hedgehog (Hh). This mechanism helps to establish an orderly arrangement of connections between the R axons and lamina neurons, termed a retinotopic map because it results in positioning the lamina neurons in close vicinity to the corresponding R axons. It is found that the bHLH-PAS transcription factor Single-minded (Sim) is induced by Hh in the lamina neurons and is required for the association of lamina neurons with R axons. In sim mutant brains, lamina neurons undergo the first step of differentiation but fail to associate with R axons. As a result, lamina neurons are set aside from R axons. The data reveal a novel mechanism for regulation of the interaction between axons and neuronal cell bodies that establishes precise neuronal networks.",

CaMKII in the two sites is interchangeable by its translocation. Translocation and targeting of this kinase to appropriate subcellular compartments are crucial for its physiological function. We have previously suggested that postsynaptic CaMKII is also localized in lipid raft microdomain (2001. Mol. Brain Res. 89, 20-28) . In this report, we proved the lipid raft localization of CaMKII by detergent-treatment and successive sucrose floatation assay of SPM or Cos7 cells expressing CaMKII, and by cholesterol depletion from membrane using MbCD. We also investigated the mechanism and properties of CaMKII targeting to lipid raft. CaMKII targeted to lipid raft microdomain possibly through protein-protein interaction. Our data suggest that lipid raft microdomain is a major site of CaMKII distribution, as well as postsynaptic density and cytoplasmic region, at the postsynaptic site. Glial glutamate transporters, GLAST and GLT-1, are co-localized in processes of Bergmann glia wrapping excitatory synapses on Purkinje cells (PCs). Although GLAST is expressed six-fold more abundantly than GLT-1, the decay kinetics of climbing fiber (CF)mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (CF-EPSCs) in PCs in GLAST(-/-) mice are not significantly different from those in wildtype mice. Here we attempted to clarify the roles of glial glutamate transporters in CF-PC synapses using GLAST(-/-) and GLT-1(-/-) mice, and a novel antagonist of glial glutamate transporters, (2S,3S)-3-[3-(4-methoxybenzoylamino)benzyloxy]aspartate. Our results indicate that glial glutamate transporters can retain the fast decay kinetics of CF-EPSCs in the normal range if a small proportion (approximately 20%) of functional transporters, GLAST and/or GLT-1, is preserved. Glutamate is well known as an essential neurotransmitter in nervous system. How glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission is controlled in neural circuit of live animal, however, remains to be poorly understood. We found that the loss-of-function mutations in VGLUT (vesicular glutamate transporter) encoded by eat-4 gene led to abnormal sensory behaviors including thermotaxis in C. elegans. Thermotaxis defect of eat-4 mutant was caused by malfunction of both thermosensory neuron AFD and its downstream interneuron RIA, suggesting that thermal signals from AFD or RIA to their downstream neurons are transmitted by glutamate through EAT-4 VGLUT. A mutation in AVR-14 glutamate receptor also led to abnormal thermotaxis. We are trying to investigate whether AVR-14 functions in the downstream neurons of AFD or RIA, and to identify other glutamate receptors involved in thermotaxis. Through the analysis of thermotaxis neural circuit, we are hoping to reveal the mechanisms of glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission at neural circuit level.",

The three known isoforms of these secondary active transporters have been characterised in terms of tissue distribution, developmental expression patterns and some pharmacological features. While the third isoform constitutes only a minor fraction, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are abundantly expressed in the brain with a complementary distribution pattern and divergences in the expression profile during ontogeny. So far, no clear difference in the function of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 has been found. To further characterise the specific properties of the transporters we make use of the VGLUT1-KO mouse which gives us the opportunity to investigate a brain devoid of VGLUTl. We focus on synaptic vesicle fractions from KO-mice to study the VGLUT-associated transport biochemically. In recent years, three isoforms of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) have been molecularly identified in mammals. Histological investigations have revealed that the distribution of three VGLUT isoforms in the CNS is largely complementary with limited overlap, suggesting that differential expression of VGLUT isoforms may contribute to functional diversity in glutamatergic synapses. However, functional differences among the isoforms remained poorly understood. To get insights into their isoform-specific property, we searched for interacting protein(s) to the C-terminus of VGLUT1 by yeast two-hybrid screening and found endophilin A1. As expected for the interacting molecule to VGLUT1, endophilin A1 was typically localized to VGLUT1-positive synaptic terminals in cultured hippocampal neurons. We are currently investigating physiological significance underlying their direct interaction and co-localization. The aim of this study is to investigate the molecular basis for lactate utilization. Hippocampal neuronal culture was continuously superfused with glucose or lactate solution and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were recorded from a voltage-clamped pyramidal neuron. In lactate solution, amplitude of EPSCs was decreased in 60\u223c90 min, followed by spontaneously recovered after120 min, while EPSC in glucose medium remained unchanged. Application of APV+Ni in lactate medium, spontaneous recovery was not observed. In neuron cultures, incorporation of 14C-lactate was gradually increased, which was suppressed by applications of inhibitors for calcium calcium channels or protein kinase C. In glial cell cultures, incorpotation of lactate was initially maintained. Increased expression of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 2 was demonstrated in the lactate medium. Results suggested that increased MCT2 expression of neurons may lead to utilization of lactate to sustain synaptic function via calcium-dependent manner.",

Here, we show a novel type of regulation of vesicle endocytosis by proteolysis. In mouse hippocampal slices, Amph I was found to be cleaved by a Ca 2+ -activated protease, calpain during prolonged depolarization or stimulus trains. The calpain-cleaved N-terminal Amph I fragment lost its ability to bind dynamin and inhibited transferrin uptake as overexpressed in COS-7 cells, indicating that the calpain cleavage of Amph I inhibits endocytosis. Amph I in hippocampus was also cleaved by calpain in vivo after kainate seizure. Although the second administration of kainate caused less severe seizure activity than the first one, this relieved second seizure was not observed in pre-treatment with a calpain inhibitor, ALLM during the first seizure. Thus, the proteolytic activity of calpain could protect neurons from excitotoxicity by inhibiting vesicle recycling. Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are effectively recycled by endocytosis for continuous synaptic transmission. Previously, we have suggested that a high level of synaptic transmission is maintained by recycling of SVs through two types of endocytosis operating coordinately (27th this meeting). In the present study, we labeled endocytosed SVs at nerve terminals of Drosophila with fluorescence dyes, FM1-43 and FM4-64, and also measured quantatively exocytosis and endocytosis of SVs, using these dyes. EGFP-labeled Cacophony Ca2+ channels and anti HRP stained the active zone and non-active zone at synapse, respectively. Imaging analysis revealed that two distinct types of endocytosis of SVs occurred at the active zone and the non-active zone of motor nerve terminals. We have previously shown that baclofen, a GABA B receptor agonist, inhibits exocytosis in synapses of mouse hippocampal neurons. Syntaxin 1A is also known to modulate exocytosis. To characterize the molecular mechanisms involved, the inhibitory effects of baclofen in neurons transfected with antisense oligonucleotide to syntaxin 1A were investigated by patch-clamp recording and counting the number of release sites. Transfected neurons showed higher frequency of miniature EPSCs and stronger inhibition by baclofen than controls, but no change in number of sites. Increased exocytosis is thus induced by increases in transmitter release per site, rather than by more sites due to neurite sprouting. These results suggest that GABA B receptor shares part of the mechanism involved in modulation of exocytosis with syntaxin 1A in mouse hippocampal neurons. We have previously shown a transient localization of tubulin (TUB) during synaptic vesicle (SV) cycling in Drosophila nerve terminals. The TUB localization is detected during SV recycling, while microtuble (MT)-loop is observed throughout SV cycle. In this study, we characterized the two distinct TUB localizations and showed their relation with SV pool formation. Axonal MTs and MT-loops abounded in acetylated (Acetyl) TUB. The transient localization was either polymerized or depolymerized, and organized by non-Acetyl TUB. Taxol decreased the non-Acetyl TUB localization but not MT-loops, and inhibited exo/endo cycling pool (ECP) formation. In boutons containing MT-loops, ECP formation was also inhibited. Acetyl MT-loops tend to be stable whereas presynaptic non-Acetyl TUBs are either free dimers or dynamic MTs. These results suggest that presynaptic dynamic TUB, especially non-Acetyl TUB, controls ECP formation. Presynaptic TUB dynamics may regulate functional presynaptic plasticity by controlling SV pools.",

PREGS facilitated presynaptic voltage-gated Ca 2+ channel (VGCC) currents via accelerating their activation kinetics, but had no effect on K + currents, resting conductance, or action potential waveforms. In simultaneous pre-and postsynaptic recordings PREGS did not change the relationship between presynaptic Ca 2+ influx and EPSCs, suggesting that exocytotic machinery downstream of Ca 2+ influx was not involved in the PREGS effect. Neither BAPTA nor GTP\u2425S loaded into presynaptic terminals blocked the effect of PREGS.

In the cerebellum, DAGL\u2423 was predominantly expressed in somatodendritic membrane of Purkinje cells, and highly concentrated at the base of spine neck. However, DAGL\u2423 was excluded from the main body of spine neck and head. In hippocampal pyramidal cells, DAGL\u2423 was selective to spines, but widely distributed within spines.

However, the physiological significance and the molecular mechanism of the remodeling are largely unknown. To address these questions, we focused on evolutionarily conserved acyltransferase like genes in C.elegans acl-1\u02dc14, and generated their deletion mutants. The mutants of acl-4 gene, which is predominantly expressed in neurons and muscles, showed no apparent phenotype. However, the mutants exhibited severe movement abnormalities in fat-3 mutant background in which long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are depleted. Pharmacological analysis revealed that these mutants showed presynaptic defects in synaptic transmission. These abnormalities were rescued by neuron specific acl-4 expression, suggesting that certain phospholipid species produced by acl-4 are involved in maintaining normal synaptic transmission and motility of C.elegans.",

It interacts with various synaptic components including NMDA receptor subunits, PSD-95 and neuroligin. As we previously reported, S-SCAM is recruited to excitatory synapses by \u2424-catenin. S-SCAM forms a ternary complex with neuroligin and PSD-95. More importantly, S-SCAM is involved in synaptic accumulation of neuroligin and subsequently affects the localization of PSD-95 at excitatory synapses. In the course of these studies, we observed signals detected by anti-S-SCAM antibody at inhibitory synapses. We have here examined whether S-SCAM is indeed localized at inhibitory synapses in hippocampal neurons.

However, there have been few analyses on postsynaptic molecular assembly in interneurons during development. To address this question, we examined dynamic properties of PSD-95 clusters in cultured hippocampal interneurons. Higher density of dendritic PSD-95 clusters was observed in interneurons at 11 DIV. At 18 DIV, this difference was less prominent, mainly due to >3-fold increase of PSDs in excitatory neurons. PSD-95-GFP imaging revealed lower rate of cluster appearance/disappearance in interneurons at 11 DIV. The higher rate of cluster turnover in excitatory neurons, together with their higher rate of net cluster increase, may explain the delayed boost of cluster density. Photobleaching of PSD-95-GFP revealed similar kinetics in two neuron types, suggesting additional determinants of cluster dynamics apart from the steady-state assembly rate. Possible involvement of other postsynaptic molecules in interneuron PSD dynamics is now being investigated.",

Our new technique with large-scale optical recordings reveals the diversity of synaptic integration in hundreds of neurons. In hippocampal slices bolus-loaded with calcium fluorophores, we stimulated the Schaffer collaterals and monitored the bulk presynaptic activity from the stratum radiatum and individual postsynaptic spikes from the CA1 stratum pyramidale. Single neurons responded to varying synaptic inputs with unreliable spikes, but at the population level, the networks output a linear sum of synaptic inputs. The network activity varied from trial to trial, even though given constant stimuli. This variation emerged through time-varying recruitment of different neuron subsets, which were shaped by correlated background noise. Our imaging approach enables linking single-cell behaviors to their communal dynamics, and we discovered that, even in a relatively simple CA1 circuit, neurons could collectively be engaged in complex information processing. It is assumed based on previous in vitro experiments by other researchers that mGluR6 connects with syntenin at the dendrites and mGluR7 with PICK1 at the axon terminal in ON cone bipolar cells. To prove this possibility, we investigated wild-type mouse retinas immunohistochemically and confirmed their co-localized immunopositive labels at the respective places. Next, we examined which scaffold protein would connect with mGluR7 that was known to be ectopicly expressed in the dendrites of mGluR6-deficient ON cone bipolar cells. We observed no PICK1 but only syntenin at the mGluR6-deficient dendrites, and also the syntenin immunopositivity was co-localized with mGluR7 immunopositivity. These findings suggest that mGluR7 connects with syntenin in place of mGluR6 that was knockout from the ON cone bipolar dendrites.",

GISP coimmunoprecipitates with GABA B 1 and GABA B 2 from rat brain. In cultured hippocampal neurons GISP displays a punctate dendritic distribution and colocalises with GABA B receptors. When co-expressed with GABA B Rs GISP increases the amount of GABA B 1 protein and also promotes GABA B 1 surface expression in the heterologous cells. Furthermore, GISP increases surface expression of GABA B 1/GABA B 2 complexes. These results suggest that GISP is involved in the forward trafficking and stabilisation of GABA B Rs. Thus GISP is an novel GABA B 1-binding protein potentially involved in the cell surface and/or synaptic targeting of the GABA B Rs. Three distinct isoforms of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT1-3) have been cloned and shown to exhibit differential distribution patterns in the brain. Recent work shows the presence of VGLUTs in synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs) of endocrine cells. Mammalian pineal melatonin-secreting cells, pinealocytes, contain numerous SLMVs which likely accumulate glutamate to inhibit melatonin synthesis. VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 seem to participate in this glutamate accumulation. In the present study, we found that VGLUT3 mRNA is also expressed in the adult rat pinealocytes. VGLUT3 immunoreactivity (IR) was distributed throughout the pineal gland, and was co-localized with VGLUT1-IR or VGLUT2-IR in many, but not all, processes of pinealocyte. These data indicate that there are some subpopulations of SLMVs which differ in the kind of VGLUT isoforms contained and/or in their combinations, suggesting VGLUT isoform-dependent sorting of SLMVs to pinealocyte processes.",

This study was thus aimed at elucidation of possible functional expression of serotonergic system in mouse osteoblasts. RT-PCR analysis revealed constitutive expression of mRNA for several 5-HT receptor subtypes, 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) and vesicular monoamine transporter 1 (VMAT1) in primary cultured mouse osteoblasts and MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. Sustained exposure to fluoxetine, a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, significantly prevented increase in alkaline phosphatase activities and mineralization in MC3T3-E1. These results suggest that serotonergic system may be functionally expressed to regulate mechanisms underlying cellular differentiation and maturation in mouse osteoblasts.",

Most hotfoot alleles identified so far have deletions of one or more exons coding for portions of the N-terminal domain of the \u24262 glutamate receptor (GluR\u24262). However, because only genomic DNA was available for most hotfoot mutants, it was unclear whether truncated forms of GluR\u24262 were actually translated and involved in the ataxic phenotype. Here, we report that a newly identified hotfoot mutant, ho15J, was caused by a new type of intragenic deletion of the Grid2 gene, which was indeed translated as GluR\u24262 lacking 52-amino acids in the N-terminus. Mutant GluR\u24262 proteins were retained in the soma of Purkinje cells and degraded. As a result, ho15J mice exhibited a severe motor discoordination on rotarod tests. Furthermore, these mice exhibited sustained innervation of Purkinje cells by multiple climbing fibers, and impaired long term depression, which is thought to underlie motor learning. These results indicate the importance of the N-terminal domain in GluR\u24262 signaling and cerebellar functions.",

In transfected cells, mutation of Asp (D/A) resulted in nonfunctional receptor despite of showing moderate level of cell surface expression and an apparent affinity to MCH. D/A mutation occurred with no increase in basal signaling pathway, suggesting no indication for constitutive activity. Y/A mutation also yielded a loss of function phenotype that is similar to D/A mutation. Mutation of the Arg (R/A) showed higher EC50 value in signaling with a decrease in MCH binding, while the level of cell surface expression exhibited only moderate decrease.

To clarify the functions and subunit dynamics of kainate receptors, we generated GluR\u24242KO mice from C57BL/6 ES cell line. The GluR\u24242KO mice were viable, fertile, and displayed no overt phenotype.

We have recently reported that semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) receptor Plexin-B1 induces growth cone collapse by functioning as an R-Ras GAP. Here we characterized the downstream signaling of Plexin-B1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity, leading to growth cone collapse. Sema4D suppressed the endogenous R-Ras activity in hippocampal neurons, in parallel with dephosphorylation of Akt and activation of GSK-3\u2424. Ectopic expression of the constitutively active mutant of Akt, myr-Akt, or treatment with GSK-3\u2424 antagonist suppressed the Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse. The R-Ras GAP activity was necessary for Plexin-B1-induced dephosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3\u2424. Plexin-A1 also induced dephosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3\u2424 through its R-Ras GAP activity. Thus, we conclude that Plexin-B1 dephosphorylates Akt and GSK-3\u2424 through R-RasGAP activity, inducing growth cone collapse. To find proteins having relations in receptor trafficking, we searched human genome database and selected hepatocyte odd protein shuttling (HOPS) as a candidate gene. HOPS had three transmembrane domains, and expressed abundantly on a brain tissue. HOPS was detected in membranous regions from subcellular fractionation and immunohistochemistry. HOPS was recruited to membranous structures when overexpressed in COS7 cells. When expressed in hippocampal cultures, HOPS enhanced the amplitude of mEPSC. From antibody feeding assay, we discovered that HOPS enhanced the recycling of GluR2. HOPS was co-immunoprecipitated with GRIP1 (Glutamate receptor interacting protein 1) when they were co-transfected to HEK cells. Thus, it was suggested that HOPS had roles in synaptic transmission enhancement by stabilization of surface GluR2 via GRIP1 binding. Serine must be taken up into neurons for their survival, because neurons lack serine biosynthetic enzyme. We have recently identified a serine transporter Asc-1. A neural amino acid transporter SNAT2/ATA2 also transports serine. We investigated their roles as serine transporters by comparing the localization of these serine transporters in the rat brain. The Asc-1 immunoreactivity (Asc-1-ir) was detected in dendrites and somata of pyramidal neurons. The SNAT2-ir was widely detected in neurons, whose intracellular localization was similar to that of Asc-1-ir. Deferent from Asc-1-ir, SNAT2-ir was also located in astrocytes and ependymal cells, especially around capillary blood vessels and ventricles. These results suggest the significant contribution of Asc-1 and SNAT2 to the neuronal uptake of L-serine. SNAT2 might also accumulate L-serine in astrocytes from the extracellular spaces including blood and CSF.",

In this study, we focused on KCC2, which lowers the intracellular chloride ion concentration, and examined the developmental localization of the KCC2 with special reference to the neuronal development in the cerebellum. KCC2 was negative in the proliferating and migrating neurons. Post-migratory neurons, which formed synapses, expressed the KCC2. The KCC2-protein was localized at the membrane of dendrites and cell bodies, whereas growth cones, axons and terminals were negative. These results suggested that formation of synapses might induce KCC2-expression and localization, and GABAergic transmission might shift from excitation to inhibition after synapse formation.",

The DA-induced inhibition declined after these periods.

Swelling of several areas within the CA1 region were detected as increases in transmittance of near infrared light (IRT). Field EPSPs (fEPs) were recorded simultaneously from the stratum radiatum of CA1 region. In adult mice, repetitive stimulation of afferent fibers induced transient increases in IRT at both somatic and dendritic regions in a frequency-dependent manner, which was temporally associated with fEPs. Application of the Bicuculline, a GABA-A receptor antagonist, reduced these optical signals. However, in mice under 15 days old, the optical signals did not follow by high-frequency stimulation of inputs, and were not affected by an application of bicuculline. These results suggested that GABA-dependency in the mechanisms of cell volume regulation developmentally changes in the hippocampal CA1 region. In the present study, the effects of bilateral injections of glutamatergic agents into the hippocampal CA1 region on morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) were investigated in rats. Subcutaneous administration of different doses of morphine (2.5-10 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent CPP. Using a 3-day schedule of conditioning, it was found that intra-CA1 administration of NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 (2 and 4 g/rat) significantly attenuated the morphine (7.5 mg/kg)-induced CPP. Moreover, NMDA receptor agonist, NMDA (0.1, 0.2 and 1 g/rat) significantly potentiated the morphine (2.5 mg/kg)-induced CPP. These results suggest that the development of morphine-induced CPP may be related to NMDA and MK-801 receptors in that the glutamatergic system can modulate opiate reward.",

            "text": "The majority of neostriatal neurons are medium-sized projection neurons with spiny dendrites and have so far been classified into three groups: striatonigral neurons producing PPD, and striatopallidal neurons producing PPE, and striatoinnominatal neurons producing PPTB. These projection neurons are regulated in part by dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra pars compacta. It has been assumed that D1 receptor are expressed in striatonigral neurons and D2 receptor are expressed in striatopallidal neurons. In recent years, molecular cloning work has shown that there are at least five dopamine receptor genes (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5). In this study, the double-labeling method combining in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry revealed how these five dopamine receptor subtypes are distributed among three projection neuron groups. The cerebellar tissue is good model system for the analysis of neuronal development, since dynamic neuronal development such as migration and axonal and dendritic outgrowth after birth. In the present study, we examined the localization of chondroitn sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGS) by CSPG-specific antibodies and lectins. CSPGs are mainly observed at molecular layer in developing cerebellum (P10-15) but they scarcely seen at external granular layer. Electron microscopic observation demonstrated that phosphacan, one of CSPGs, is localized at axonal membrane of parallel fibers. Moreover, phosphacan inhibited adhesion and axonal extension of cerebellar granular neurons, while it promoted axonal fasciculation of their aggregated cultures. Thus, CSPGs, inhibitory molecules for axonal extension, are participated in axonal guidance cue in developing cerebellum. The vasopressin neurons are well knwon to show structural plasticity during chronic physiological stimulation such as salt loading.",

            "text": "In the present study, salt loading significantly diminished the levels of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in vasopressin neurons. This downregulation is possibly due to proteolysis by tPA, since (1) tPA immunoreactivity was observed at neurosecretory granules of vasopressin dendrites and terminals, (2) Salt loading increased protein and mRNA levels of tPA in the somata and dendrites in the supraoptic nucleus but reduced protein levels of it in the terminals of the neurohypophysis, (3) Depolarizing agent released tPA from isolated neurosecretosomes, (4) tPA knockout mice revealed lower ability of osmotic homeostasis and vasopressin release. Thus, it is probable that tPA is participated in regulating structural plasticity of vasopressin neurons by degrading CSPGs. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycans are essential for neuronal morphogenesis, including neural migration, survival and neurite formation in the developing brain. CS chains are modified by various sulfotransferases generating diverse sulfation patterns, which are assumed to be involved in the selective binding to various proteins such as growth factors. In this study, we analyzed the expression patterns of several CS sulfotransferases in the developing mouse cerebrum. Using in situ hybridization analysis, it was revealed that CS sulfotransferase mRNAs (U2ST, GalNAc4-6ST, D4ST) were expressed in various types of cells, especially in the ventricular zone, and the cortical plate neurons just below the marginal zone. Immunohistochemical analysis with anti-CS antibodies revealed that CS were highly expressed in the ventricular zone and the marginal zone. These results suggest that the CS structural domains generated by these CS sulfotransferases are involved in the regulation of the proliferation of neural progenitor cells and neuronal migration.",

Among the epitopes recognized by these antibodies, the expression of MO-225 epitopes, GlcA(2S)\u24241-3GalNAc(6S) (D unit)containing structures, remarkably increased during development. Detailed immunohistochemical analysis indicated that D unit-rich CS was deposited between Purkinje cell surface and the processes of Bergmann glia. Furthermore, it was found that pleiotrophin bound to D unit-rich CS on phosphacan distributed around Purkinje cells.

We previously revealed that PTP associated with Delta/Notchlike EGF-related receptor (DNER), which mediates the PC-Bergmann glia (BG) interaction and regulates morphological differentiation of these cells. Here, we found that PTP was expressed by both PCs and BGs and the expression by PC occurred at relatively late developmental stage. PTP showed patchy distribution in the dendritic shafts of PCs, which partially overlapped with the localization of DNER. Furthermore, we revealed that multiple tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of DNER were phosphorylated and that these tyrosine phosphorylated residues were efficiently dephosphorylated by the PTP catalytic domain.

To investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of dendrite development of Purkinje cells, we cocultured Purkinje cells on a coverslip with other cerebellar cells such as granule cells and astrocytes on the cell culture insert of 3 m pore size. When Purkinje cells were co-cultured with granule cells, dendrite development of Purkinje cells was promoted in comparison with that in control conditions. This co-culture effect was abolished by addition of a glutamate antagonist in the cultures. In contrast, dendrite development of Purkinje cells was inhibited when Purkinje cells were co-cultured with astrocytes. We propose that (i) glutamate secreted by granule cells and diffused through the porous membrane of the cell culture insert promotes the dendrite development of Purkinje cells and (ii) astrocytes inhibit the effect of glutamate through their glutamate transporting activity. Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans regulate neural development through the interaction with cell surface proteins and extracellular matrix molecules. An extracellular endosulfatase, SulfFP1, has been implicated in the regulation of growth factor/morphogen signaling through HS remodeling in vitro, but its physiological roles remain unknown. Here we generated knockout mice lacking the SulfFP1 gene, and examined the motor control. Homozygotes appeared to be normal, showing no sign of ataxia. Performances of the rotarod and beam-walking tests were normal compared with the control mice. Both short-term and long-term adaptations in the optokinetic response were normal, while the gains in optokinetic response and vestibulocular reflex were significantly reduced. Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans regulate a number of developmental signaling through interactions with cell surface proteins and extracellular matrix molecules. These interactions are mediated by the specific sulfation patterns in HS, but the mechanism generating such modifications has not been fully elucidated. Here we show that a new class of HS endosulfatases plays an important role in brain development. The mice deficient in either SulfFP1 or SulfFP2 appeared to be normal, while most of the double knockout mice died soon after birth. Mutant brains had higher content of 6-O-sulfated disaccharide units in HS, suggesting a role of SulfFPs in heparan sulfate remodeling in vivo. The double mutant brains were smaller than the controls and showed some axon guidance defects. These data demonstrate that specific HS modification generated by SulfFPs is important for normal brain development. Recent studies have suggested monoamine affects neural development, but it is unclear which receptor subtypes mediate actions of monoamine. Here, we examined roles of 5-hydroxytryptoamine (5-HT), noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) in the formation of dendrites and synapses by dissociation culture. Embryonic day 16 or 18 rat cerebral cortex was cultured in the presence of 5-HT, NA or DA. After 4 days, we analyzed dendrite formation using anti-MAP2 antibody. After 14-21 days, we analyzed synaptogenesis with anti-PSD-95, anti-synaptophysin, and anti-MAP2 antibodies. The addition of 5-HT (100-10000 nM), NA (100-1000 nM) or DA (10-1000 nM) increased dendritic length of pyramidal neurons. 5-HT (100-1000 nM) also increased the synaptic density. By using receptor agonists and antagonists, it was suggested that dendritic outgrowth may be promoted by 5-HT 1A receptor, \u2423 2A receptor and D 2 receptor, while inhibited by 5-HT 2A and \u2424receptors. In addition, synaptogenesis was promoted by 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors, whereas inhibited by 5-HT 1A receptor.",

However, it is not known whether netrin-1 also exerts chemoattractive effect on ventral-ward migrating dorsal interneurons in the developing spinal cord. To test this hypothesis, we examined dorsal interneuron migration in netrin-1 \u2212/\u2212 background, using Olig3-lacZ knockin allele, which marks most of ventral-ward migrating dorsal interneurons. In the embryonic spinal cord of Olig3 +/lacZ ;netrin-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, ventral migration of Olig3 cells was significantly impaired.

Netrin-G1 and netrin-G2 differentially bind to LRRcontaining proteins, NGL-1 and a related molecule NAG14, in vitro. NGL-1 and NAG14 in the mouse brain are concentrated in distinct dendritic segments, corresponding to lamina-specific termination of axons expressing netrin-G1 and netrin-G2, respectively. Furthermore, in netrin-G1 and netrin-G2 deficient mice, in which axonal pathfinding is normal, there is selective mislocation of individual receptors within dendrites. Together, these results suggest that axonal netrin-G proteins transneuronally regulate the localization of distinct receptors on dendrites, and thereby determine the properties of subdendritic segments.",

Mahya encodes a secretory protein with a follistatin-like domain, two immunoglobulin domains, and a C-terminal novel domain. Mouse Mahya genes (mMahya-1 and mMahya-2) are expressed in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum of the adult brain. We have found that mMahya-1 protein is specifically synthesized in the pre-migratory granule cells and localized at the molecular layer of the postnatal cerebellum. These results suggest that mMahya-1 is involved in either the migration of granule cells or the dendritic maturation of Purkinje cells. We will further report the analysis of the functions of mMahya-1 for the early cerebellum development.",

Although density and thickness of parallel fibers are important information for cerebellar development, few were simple and useful methods. We have proposed a new method for two-dimensional acoustic impedance imaging for developing cerebellar slices. An acoustic impedance microscopy was obtained by mechanically scanning the transducer and the reflection intensity was interpreted into local acoustic impedance of no treated acute slices with no invasion. The developing parallel fibers were clearly observed as the contrast in acoustic impedance, whereas they were cloudy in immature EGL from neonatal rat. The reflection from molecular layer enlarged and floated to deep layer, so that its spatial pattern was changed during cerebellar development. This imaging method is believed to be a powerful tool for observation of neuronal development, as neither fixation nor staining is required.",

In the present study, we examined cerebellar afferent and efferent systems of this mutant mouse by neural tracing methods with a combination of immunohistochemistry. The injection of Fluoro-Gold (FG) into the cbll thalamus resulted in retrograde labeling of neurons in the contralateral cerebellar nuclei. These FG-labeled neurons were glutaminase-positive. After the injection of BDA into the cbll lumbar cord, spinocerebellar terminals projecting to the deep cerebellar nuclei were anterogradely labeled in spite of absence of the cerebellar cortex.

As the muscarinic agonist, pilocarpine, can induce similar morphological changes, hippocampal slices treated with this drug have been widely used as a model of epilepsy. We found that pilocarpine induced a transient retraction and subsequent elongation of the neurites of granule cells in the slice cultures; the retraction was peaked approximately 12 h and the elongation started at approximately 24 h after the drug application. Tetrodotoxin strongly inhibited both the retraction and elongation, while the BDNF sequestering protein, TrkB/FC, retarded only the elongation.

Once this oneway projection is disrupted, the MFs retrogradely innervate granule cell dendrites and make excitatory synapses that induce epileptic neural activities in the DG. To clarify the mechanism that regulates normal, anterograde MF projections, we used a co-culture system of hippocampal slices. When a DG slice from a GFP(+) rat was juxtaposed to the CA3 region of a host hippocampal slice from a wild type rat, the GFP(+) MFs ran through the host CA3 toward the host DG but failed to invade it even after ten days in vitro. Thus the DG seemed to serve as a barrier that blocks retrograde projections of MFs. However, the MFs extended into the DG when forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, was chronically applied. These results suggest that the DG has a mechanism supporting anterograde MF projections to CA3, which is regulated by the levels of adenylate cyclase activation. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a 37 amino acid neuropeptide that is widely distributed in central and peripheral nervous systems. CGRP is expressed from early developmental stage in rat brain, suggesting that CGRP may be involved in not only neurotransmission but also neural development.

Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effect of glucocorticoid (Dexamethasone, DEX) on synaptic maturation and function enhanced by BDNF in early developing hippocampal neurons. We found that BDNF increased the expression of synaptic proteins including glutamate receptor and presynaptic protein, however, pretreatment with DEX significantly inhibited the up-regulation of these proteins by BDNF.

However, no strain difference was not found in vitro in the salivation rate, suggesting exsisting of a negative feedback loop between the central thermoregulation system and evaporation system. On the other hand, body temperature of the FOK rats did not decreased in a extream cold environment as those in control rat strain. Thermogenesis induced by cold in FOK rats was larger than those in control rat strains. The larger increase in thermogenesis was partly attributable to glucagon-induced thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. Blood levels of triglryceride was lower, but polyunsaturated fatty acids were higher in FOK rats than those in control rat strains. These changes can be considered to be results of genetically acquired heat-tolerance. Oxidative stress is involved in the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in Parkinson s disease (PD). Vitamin E is a potent antioxidant, and its retention and secretion are regulated by alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (TTP) in brain. Dysfunction of TTP has been shown to result in systemic deficiency of Vitamin E in human and mice. In the present study, we using the TTP knockout mice, investigated the effect of Vitamin E deficiency in PD development by generating MPTP mouse model of PD. We confirmed that Vitamin E depleted in the brain of TTP knockout mice completely. While the MPTP treatment decreased striatal dopamine in the all three TTP genotypic groups, there were no significant differences among them. Our results suggest that Vitamin E does not play a major protective role in MPTP-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the brain.",

The over expression of CHIP reduces the aggregate formation and cell death mediated by expanded polyglutamine proteins and the suppressive effect is more prominent when CHIP is over expressed along with Hsc70. Finally, we show that the expression of CHIP is increased in the expanded polyglutamine protein expressing cells. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is central to the regulation of stress response.

In the present study, we examined the effect of MS on an array of emotional and socio-sexual behaviors in both sexes of C57BL/6J mice. Pups were separated from mothers daily (3 h) on postnatal days 1 through 14. Starting at 13 weeks of age they were tested for (1) emotionality and anxiety levels in open field (OFT), light-dark transition (LDT), and elevated plus maze tests; (2) responses to social stimuli in social investigation (SIT) and social preference tests; and (3) socio-sexual behaviors in aggressive and sexual behavior tests. Overall, there was no apparent effect of MS on behaviors measured in the OFT and LDT except for higher levels of exploration in the MS group compared to the non-stressed (NS) group in both sexes. During the SIT, social investigation time and general activity in MS females were much lower than those in NS females suggesting MS females may be more fearful to social stimuli. In the present study, we investigated the effect of environmental stress applied during perinatal period on spatial learning activity of mouse evaluated by Morris water maze test. Mice were exposed to the noise of 90 dB (SO), or were forced to swim (SW). These manipulations were performed for 15 min once a day at 2 weeks after birth (from postnatal days 14 to 18) or 3 weeks after birth (from postnatal day 21 to 25). Normal mice were left undisturbed (NO). The spatial learning activity was tested at the age of 6 weeks. It was found that the spatial learning activity of both SO and SW mice manipulated 2 weeks after birth was impaired as compared to NO mice. SO mice manipulated 3 weeks after birth exhibited the same learning behavior as NO mice, while that of SW mice manipulated 3 weeks after birth was impaired. Present results indicated that the effect of the environmental stress on the learning activity of the adolescent mice might be dependent on the period of the stress manipulation.",

In addition, aged mice with masticatory dysfunction show deficits in spatial memory, being due to various pathological changes in the hippocampus, suggesting the link between malocclusion induced by abnormal occlusion and hippocampal pathology. In this study, to prove this hypothesis, we examined the effect of this malocclusion on plasma corticosterone levels, the numbers of hippocampal neurons and spatial performance in water maze in SAMP8 mice. This treatment age-dependently advanced a decline in spatial memory, an increase in plasma corticosterone levels, and a decrease in neuron density in the hippocampal CA3 region. The results suggest that abnormal occlusion may progress hippocampal neuron loss via stress, thereby leading to senile deficits in memory.",

Blood samples were obtained from adult male and female Slc Wistar rats immediately after acute random electrical footshock and also from these animals after chronic social isolation (for 12 weeks after weaning). In na\u00efve, male rats expressed higher densities of platelet PBR than females. Chronic social isolation caused a marked increase in platelet PBR in male rats compared to female.

The rectal temperature of singly housed mice was measured twice at a 10-min interval, to measure the basal temperature (T 1 ) and stress-enhanced temperature (T 2 ), respectively. The difference ( T = T 2 \u2212 T 1 ) gives the SIH. In control mice, T was approximately 1 \u2022 C. Pretreatment with diazepam caused dose-dependent inhibition of the SIH. Similarly, putrescine reduced T, although it caused a dose-dependent decrease in T 1 . Furthermore, spermidine and spermine also lowered T and T 1 at doses lower than that of putrescine.

Of their synthesis, the rate limiting step depends on cyclooxygenase (COX), which has two subtypes, COX-1 and COX-2. It has been known that, under some stressful conditions, COX-2 is induced in some neurons and increases PGs production. But the roles of the increased PGs under stress are not fully elucidated. In this study, we restrained mice in small tubes individually for 6 h and subjected them to the elevated plus maze task 24 h later. These mice showed more anxiety. Immunohistochemistry showed significant induction of COX-2 by restraint in some parts of the brain, such as cerebral cortices and amygdala. Next, we examined the effect of indomethacin on this stress-induced anxiety. Indomethacin is expected to reduce PGs production. Mice treated with indomethacin stayed on open arms longer than control mice. These data suggest that PGs synthesized during stress may have anxiety-increasing effect.",

It is still open question, however, how information of stressor activates the orexinergic neurons. In this study, we examined possible afferent nuclei to activate orexinergic neurons. In urethane-anesthetized mice, a GABA-A receptor antagonist, bicuculline, was microinjected into the amygdala or the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), of which electrical stimulation induced simultaneous increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration. Bicuculline dose-dependently induced cardiorespiratory excitation in both orexin neuron-ablated and wild-type mice. However, dose-response curve was rightward shifted in the former. We conclude that the amygdala and BNST constitute one of the afferent pathways to the orexinergic neurons that involved in the defense response against stressor. In this study, developmental changes of anxiety behavior as well as myelin formation were investigated in male Balb/C mice. The early-weaned mice had lower number of entries to the open arms of elevated plus maze at the age of 3-8 weeks, indicating persistent higher anxiety. High performance thin layer chromatography analysis was conducted for amygdaloid galactosyl ceramide, which is a typical lipid of myelin. The early-weaned mice had higher levels of galactosyl ceramide at the age of 5 weeks, and an electron microscopic study suggested increased number of myelinated axon and reduced diameter of myelinated axon in the basolateral amyglaloid nucleus. These results suggest that the early weaning induces precocious myelin formation in the amygdale between 3 and 5 weeks of age, which would be related to higher anxiety state in the early-weaned mice.",

In three behavioral tests except for open field, sham-operated mice exposed to music showed less anxiety than those exposed to white-noise and silence, while OVX + placebo mice did not show these effects at all. OVX + E2 mice showed the anxiolytic effect of music only in the marble burying test.

The ACe axon terminals, which usually contain small pleomorphic vesicles and occasionally contain both small pleomorphic vesicles and large dense-cored vesicles, formed symmetrical synapses with cell bodies and dendrites of the RFp-projecting RRF neurons.

Similar phenotype was seen in the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) overexpressing mice. This phenotype of YF/YF mice was canceled by the administration of CRF receptor antagonist. As expected, in YF/YF mice, the expression level of CRF in the amygdala was increased compared with that in wild-type mice. In the slice of amygdala from wild-type mice, NMDA application induced de-phosphorylation of Tyr-1472 and up-regulation of CRF mRNA level.

In mice housed in enriched condition for 5 weeks, locomotor activity and longinterval (200, 1000 and 5000 ms) paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) at MF synapses were reduced. In contrast, in mice housed in isolated condition for 5 weeks, there was no detectable change in either the total ambulation distance or the magnitude of PPF. We compared properties of the MF synaptic transmission with the locomotor activity in individual mice used in all experiments and found that the magnitude of synaptic potentiation induced by dopamine was negatively correlated with the ambulation distance. Our results suggest that the modification of the hippocampal mossy fiber synaptic transmission could be involved in the environmental regulation of locomotor activity.",

We have been demonstrated that the inhibition was not induced by thermal effect on the neural function or by muscular fatigue. Furthermore, the inhibition period was significantly decreased by pre-treatment with NS-398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. These observations indicate that the arachidonic acid cascade is involved in inhibition of long-term ICSS and would be in weariness or fatigue sensation. Male bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, is known to display alternative reproductive tactics. \"Parental\" males defend nests and provide parental care, and \"satellites\" or \"sneakers\" are non-nesting, attempting to achieve parasitic fertilizations via sperm competition. In teleost and other non-mammals, arginine vasotocin (AVT), the homologue of mammalian AVP, is known as an important hypothalamic peptide involved in the alteration of reproductive behavior. Behavioral evaluation and immunohistochemical study in preoptic area (POA) were conducted in parental and satellite bluegills to clear the role of AVT in teleost reproductive tactics. Parentals displayed more aggressive and courtship behavior than satellites and satellite males had significantly more cells than parentals, while the size of AVT cells showed no difference between the male morphs. These results suggested that hypothalamic AVT might play some part in the central control of reproductive behavior in teleost.",

Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan Social animals have highly developed communicative abilities. The worker honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) can transmit location of food sources by the dance language. In spite of the simple structure of the honeybee brain and the stereotyped dance behavior, its neural mechanisms remain totally unknown. Previously, we found active brain regions in the dancing workers (dancers) by using a novel immediate early gene, kakusei, as a marker for neural activities and found its prominent expression in the small-type Kenyon cells (sKCs) of the mushroom bodies. Here, we report that kakusei was similarly expressed in the sKCs of the foraging workers (foragers), which do not always show the dance behavior. In contrast, the sKCspreferential kakusei expression was not observed in the brains of the orienting workers, which were flying to learn the hive location. These results imply that the activities of the sKCs in the dancer brain are neither due to dance presentation itself nor sensory inputs during foraging, but complex information processing accompanying the foraging behavior. C. elegans wild type animals are usually attracted to NaCl, but show avoidance behaviors after being conditioned with NaCl and starvation (food\u2212/NaCl+). This behavioral plasticity is not induced under the food\u2212/NaCl\u2212 or food+/NaCl+ conditions.",

Currently, we are trying to dissect the molecular and cellular analysis of aho-3 gene further. We have demonstrated aversive conditioning in Lymnaea using 100 mM sucrose presentation as the appetitive stimulus (CS) and mechanical tactile stimulation to the head as the noxious stimulus (UCS). We measured the feeding response before and after pairing with the aversive stimulus to determine whether learning alters the innate preference for sucrose. We also measured the neuronal activity of B3, located in the buccal ganglion. An associative memory, lasting 24 h, was produced with 20 pairings of CS and UCS. The learning was characterized by a shift in the response to the UCS from a whole body withdrawal response to the cessation of feeding behavior. B3 neuron responded with repetitive impulse discharge regularly as fictive feeding patterns to a sucrose application in naive animals, on the other hand CS application failed to generate regular impulse activity rather it resulted in generation of epsps in the conditioned animal. This can interpret that the conditioning decreased the excitability of B3 neuron activity thus to decrease the fictive feeding behavior.",

By expressing shi ts1 in larval MBs, we demonstrate that disruption of neural output from MBs abolishes both appetitive and aversive memory indicating that both memories are stored before the MB output synapses.

Klg belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and was originally identified as an essential gene for the development of photoreceptor neurons. We report here that klg is necessary for long-term memory as well as early-phase memory. We show that klg expression is dependent on neural activity and functions as a downstream of both the transcription factor, CREB and the cell surface receptor Notch, both of which are well known to function in LTM formation. Transgenic expression of klg improves memory of a klg mutant. Since Klg protein localizes along the surface between neuropil and neuropil glia, we propose that klg mediates an interaction between neurons and glia that is required for memory formation. We have investigated the ability of context-dependent olfactory learning in the cockroach, Periplaneta Americana. We trained one group of cockroaches to associate peppermint odor (conditioned stimulus, CS, P) with sucrose solution (appetitive unconditioned stimulus, US+), and vanilla odor (CS, V) with saline solution (aversive US, US\u2212) under illumination (L), and to associate P with US\u2212 and V with US+ in the dark (D). Another group received training with opposite stimulus setup (L: V+/P\u2212, D: V\u2212/P+). Before training, cockroaches preferred V over P. 1 day after training, the former group significantly preferred P over V under illumination but preferred V over P in the dark, and the latter group displayed the invert odor preference. Result of the control experiment excluded the possibilities that conditioning hours of the day or its order was used as cues to disambiguate the meaning of CSs.

Here, we established antennal classical conditioning of salivation and that of activities of salivary neurons in cockroaches, Periplaneta americana. In insects, antennae are elaborate sense organ that processes many sensory modalities including odor and taste. We found that responses of salivary neurons to an odor was increased after repetitive pairing of the odor with sucrose or saline solution presented to an antenna, but those to an odor paired with water or tactile stimulus presented to an antenna did not changed. The level of salivation to sucrose-associated odor was significantly greater than that to non-associated odor.

We pharmacologically studied the roles of OA and DA in appetitive and aversive forms of visual pattern learning in crickets. Crickets injected with OA receptor antagonists exhibited no significant levels of appetitive visual learning, but aversive one was unaffected. The opposite influences were observed by injection of DA receptor antagonists. Our finding that OA and DA participate in reward and punishment conditioning in visual learning, together with results of previous studies in olfactory learning, suggests ubiquitous roles of the octopaminergic reward system and dopaminergic punishment system in insect learning. This suggests conserved roles of aminergic reinforcing systems among different phyla.",

Cells labeled by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a cell birth marker, appear in the ventricular zone, migrate into HVC, and some of them mature into projection neuron. To assess the role of neurogenesis in adult song plasticity, we deafened adult Bengalese finches, whose songs are disorganized and become plastic within the first month after deafening, and then stabilize. Deafened birds had more BrdU-labeled cells in HVC than control birds within the first month. More TUNEL-stained apoptotic cells also tended to be seen in HVC of deafened birds. However, number of the BrdU-labeled cells decreased 2 months after deafening, when the songs had stabilized. Most of the BrdU-labeled cells in HVC of deafened birds were immunoreactive for a neuron-specific marker, Hu. Additionally, amount of singing in deafened birds, which may affect amount of neurogenesis, did not significantly differ from that in control birds. These results suggest that the amount of neurogenesis is related to adult song plasticity.",

Young male songbirds learn to imitate their tutor's song during a specific time in development, which is referred to as a sensitive period. Many behavioral studies have shown that vocal learning is affected by a song template and social factors. If a young bird is raised without a tutor's song template (father) and/or social contacts with other birds, including its mother and siblings, it produces an abnormal isolated song, meaning that isolation delays the sensitive period for song learning. Here, we investigated for the delayed song learning of socially isolated zebra finches from new tutors. Consequently, isolated birds, exposed to new tutors from day 120, developed the zebra finch-typical song (song syntax), similar to song acquisition in young birds during the sensitive period of song learning. However, they were not able to imitate the syllable phonology from new tutors. The differences between two aspects of song organization suggest that the schedules and processes of the learning of phonology may be different from those of song syntax.",

In a classical conditioning paradigm, young rats show aversion to the odor that has been paired with foot shock. Our studies have shown that plasticity in the OB is critical for this olfactory learning. Pups that received OT infusion into the OB in the presence of citral odor developed an aversion to the odor without shock, suggesting that OT infusion has a facilitatory effect on olfactory learning. Using OB slices, long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced in field EPSPs recorded in the granule cell layer. OT administration also facilitated LTP.

The knowledge on the mouse eyeblink conditioning is far less compared with rabbit's. We examined the role of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) during delay eyeblink conditioning in C57BL/6 mice by using GABA A receptors agonist and antagonist. In the acquisition tests, in which muscimol (MSC) or picrotoxin (PTX) was injected from beginning of training, aCSF-injected control mice learned this task, but both MSC-and PTX-injected mice showed a significant impairment in acquisition of conditioned response (CR). In the retention tests, in which the drug was injected after acquisition of training, CR % in aCSF-injected mice were kept over 80%, while those in the MSCand PTX-injected mice decreased to 30%. These results revealed that GABAA receptors in the DCN play important roles in acquisition and retention of mouse eyeblink conditioning. Various forms of synaptic plasticity are found in cerebellar circuits, but their significance in motor leaning remains unknown. In the cerebellum, Delphilin is expressed selectively in Purkinje cells (PCs) and localized exclusively at parallel fiber (PF) synapses, where it interacts with glutamate receptor \u24262 that is essential for long-term depression (LTD) and motor learning. Here, we showed that ablation of Delphilin proteins facilitated LTD induction at PF-PC synapses and enhanced optokinetic response adaptation without affecting histology. This finding suggests that threshold regulation of LTD at PF-PC synapses is a limiting step for motor learning efficiency.",

It was found that an s-N, d-P potential, at about 40 ms latency from stimulus, in the caudal bank of the left arcuate sulcus (homolog of Broca's area) was related to recognition learning (association of stimulus with movement), and that an s-N, d-P potential in the motor and somatosensory cortices, and areas 5 and 7, contralateral to the operating hand, was related to skill learning (making movements quicker and more appropriate). In visuo-initiated hand movements, the left prefrontal cortex was related to recognition learning; the motor and somatosensory cortices, and area 5 to skill learning, as previously reported. This indicates that motor programming for somatosensory-initiated and visuo-initiated hand movement differs. Computational studies of hippocampal function generally assume that CA1 performs a match-mismatch comparison of memory retrieval with sensory input. Here we investigated this comparator model using an ensemble recording during task behaviors in the rat. We employed directional memory-guided alternation and visual cue discrimination tasks for the same animal. After training, the animals tended to predict a next direction according to the alternation paradigm even in the visual cue discrimination task. During this task, we found that some CA1 neurons showed specific bursts when a predicted event did not occur or along the trajectories of their corrective movements from a wrong cite to a correct cued one. These data suggest that CA1 plays an important role in the mismatch detecting and correcting process of behavior. N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has high permeability to Ca 2+ but is blocked by Mg 2+ in a voltage-dependent manner. This property is a molecular basis of NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation, which is thought to play a central role in learning and memory. We have generated the genetically engineered mice in which mutated NMDA receptors defecting in Mg 2+ binding ability are expressed specifically in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, the entry point to the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit. The mutant mice showed a variety of behavioral abnormalities including hyperactivity, impaired prepulse inhibition. To elucidate the effect of mutation on the information processing in the hippocampus, we recorded the place-related activity from hippocampal CA1 cells, the output stage of hippocampal circuit.

The first fiber system gives rise to projections to the superficial portion of the dentate molecular layer, and the longitudinal axonal trajectory of this system ceased within the range of about 1.5 mm from the injection level. In the second fiber system, axonal terminations began to appear at the level of 1 mm apart from the injection level and were distributed in further full septotemporal extent of the dentate molecular layer. The axonal arborizations of the second system were found in the deepest portion of the dentate molecular layer immediately above the granular cell layer. In the experiment of fluorescent dye injection, several kinds of cells in the hilus were retrogradely labeled.",

BMAL1 functions by forming a heterodimer with either CLOCK or NPAS2, which has been known to play important roles in control of circadian rhythm and memory formation, respectively. To understand roles of BMAL1 in forebrain function, we generated conditional mutant mice that enable to induce the inhibition of BMAL1 function in a forebrain. Using a dominant negative mutant of BMAL1 (BMAL1 R91A) that forms a heterodimer with CLOCK but loses the binding activity with E-box (Hosoda et al., 2004), we generated transgenic mice expressing this mutant under the control of tetracycline-dependent promoter. These mutant mice were crossed to transgenic lines expressing tetracycline-dependent transcription factors (tTA) under the control of alpha CaMKII promoter. We observed the expression of BMAL1 R91A in several double transgenic lines in a tTA-dependent manner. Behavioral analyses showed that these mutant mice showed an impairment of memory formation, indicating crucial roles of BMAL1 in learning and memory. Stress sometimes causes memory deficits. And chewing has been shown to reduce stress. However, the chewing-related mechanism in stress-induced memory deficits is unclear. We thus examined the effects of chewing on spatial memory using Morris water maze and Fos induction in the hippocampus and amygdala in stressed mice. When mice were exposed to restraint stress, reduction in learning ability and density of Fos-positive cells in the DG and the BLA was seen, but not in the mice chewing a thin wooden bar during stress exposure. The results suggest involvement of the amygdaloidmechanism by which chewing may prevent the stress-induced impairment of hippocampus-dependent memory.",

Although BGN increased Fos positive acetylcholinergic neurons (Fos-ChAT) in mesopontine tegmentum (MT) regardless of the intensity, Fos-ChAT in basal forebrain (BF) increased intensity-dependently. In locus coeruleus (LC) and cortex, Fos positive cell increased intensitydependently. Furthermore, 100 dB BGN remarkably enhanced Fos expression in stress-related nuclei, such as paraventricular nucleus and central nucleus of the amygdala. These results suggest that BGN improve spatial performance by enhancing arousal following activation of cholinergic neurons in MT and BF, and LC neurons. However, higher BGN intensity could evoke over-arousal and stress responses, thereby prevent the maze task.",

This is the first study investigating the effects of TDE on cortical AChE activity and neuronal activity in in vivo. We used Fos immunohistochemistry to determine the neuronal activity and the colorimetric method to investigate cortical AChE activity following the single injection of various TDE doses. Mean Fos-positive neurons in cortex were 101 \u00b1 14, 124 \u00b1 19 and 108 \u00b1 22 in the groups administered 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg TDE, respectively. Cortical Fos-positive neurons in all three TDE-treated groups were greater than those in the control group. Percent inhibition of cortical AChE activity was 17.4 \u00b1 6.3, 22.7 \u00b1 6.9 and 16.6 \u00b1 5.0 for 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg TDE, respectively. These AChE inhibitory effects were significantly different from the control. These findings suggest that TDE could be beneficial as a possible novel therapeutic agent for AD. We showed the effects of a 2-h TDE administration in animals on the inhibition of cortical AChE activity and the enhancement of cortical neuronal activity. AChE activity in circulation following a 2-h TDE administration was not different compared to the control. This study investigated that the effects of TDE on circulating AChE activity (cAChE) in animal models was time-dependent. We used the colorimetric method to investigate cAChE activity in rats following the single administration of TDE at various doses at different time courses (10, 60 and 120 min). Percentage inhibition of cAChE activity following a single TDE injection at doses 500 and 1000 mg/kg significantly decreased at 10 and 60 min after TDE injection, but not at 120 min. cAChE inhibitory effects among two doses of TDE administrated groups at various time courses were not significantly different. These findings suggest that TDE may be a short-acting AChE inhibitor. Donepezil, galanthamine and tacrine are acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors used for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We examined the neuroprotective mechanisms of AChE inhibitors against apoptotic glutamate neurotoxicity using cortical neurons. We show that they protect neurons through mechanisms other than AChE inhibition. The protective effects are mediated through nicotinic receptors (nAChRs). Donepezil and galanthamine protect neurons through \u24234and \u24237-nAChR and kinases involved in PI3K-Akt pathway, and increase the levels of phosphorylated Akt and Bcl-2. These results suggest that these AChE inhibitors express their neuroprotective effects against glutamate neurotoxicity through nAChRs and that donepezil and galanthamine protect neurons through PI3K-Akt pathway via \u24234and \u24237-nAChRs.",

Three measures: mobile fraction (Mf), diffusion constant (D), and time constant (\u03c4), were estimated among YC, OC, and OA. Each of these parameters was significantly different between OC and YC, suggesting that membrane fluidity is lower in OC than in YC. In contrast, D and \u03c4 were almost comparable in OA and YC, indicating that hippocampal neuronal membranes supplemented with AA were more fluid than those in OC, whereas the fraction of available molecules remained smaller than in YC.

In vitro, we examined the effects of various form of A\u2424peptide on the proliferation and differentiation of NSC from SVZ of 10-week-old adult mice. In this study, A\u242442 peptide was prepared three forms of aggregating stage, monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar A\u242442 peptide. We found that treatment of NSC with oligomeric form of A\u242442 peptides remarkably increased the number of neurospheres during proliferation and neurons during differentiation in-vitro. We also found that these neurogenesis was accompanied by morphological change of neuron. The number of secondary and tertiary neurites increased at submicromolar concentrations of oligomeric A\u242442 peptide without shrinkage of axonal length. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, the formation of senile plaque with accumulated microglia is observed.

APP has a functional sequence in its cytoplasmic domain, the YENPTY motif, which is involved in trafficking, internalization, and metabolism of APP. X11-like protein (X11L) was identified as a molecule that interacts with the motif and regulates APP metabolism in cultured cells (1999 . J. Biol. Chem. 274, 2243 2003. J. Biol. Chem. 278, 49448) . There is no evidence, however, that endogenous X11L suppresses APP metabolism and A\u2424 generation in vivo. To examine the physiologic role of X11L in APP metabolism in the brain, we generated X11L null mutant mice. The mutant mice developed normally without gross anatomic brain abnormalities. There were increased amounts of Cterminal fractions cleaved at the \u2424-site and A\u2424, but the amount of total APP was unaltered in the mutant mouse brain. These results suggest that X11L suppresses the production of A\u2424 by inhibiting \u2424secretase-induced proteolysis of APP. It is still unknown how human's central nervous system (CNS) controls its body system to keep the body balanced. This study aims to analyze the characteristics of spectral response of body sway in eyes open and in eyes closed during static upright stance based on a PID control model. In this model, body sway in medial-lateral direction is considered, and the body is simply modelled as a multi-link inverted pendulum system. Spectral response analysis showed the gain varied with input frequency and time lag. Peaks of the gain were intensively influenced by controller's parameters (KP, KD and KI). Parameters identification showed that KD is decreased in eye-closed. By simulation, the spectral responses of the PID model quite agreed with the experimental data. The results proved that the spectral characteristics of body sway is determined by the dynamics of body system and its controller's parameters, suggest the balance-keeping control in CNS can be modelled as a PID controller. Nuclear dysfunction is a critical element of the pathology of polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases. Proteome analysis of soluble nuclear proteins in the nuclear matrix of neurons expressing normal or mutant huntingtin or ataxin-1 protein by 2D-electrophoresis and TOF-MASS delineate that mutant AT1 and Htt proteins similarly reduce transcriptional factor X1 and X2. Immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays support interaction between polyQ and factor X1 and X2. Immunohistochemistry of Hela cells and primary neurons reveal sequestration of factor X1 and X2 into inclusion bodies and reduction of them in the nuclear matrix. Compensatory expression of factor X1 and X2 ameliorates poly-Q pathology in Htt-/AT1-expressing neurons and transgenic Drosophila. These results suggest that factor X1 and X2 are critical regulators of polyglutamine disease pathology and could be a target for developing therapeutics.",

Flax 2 1 Phenomenome Discoveries Inc., Saskatoon, Canada; 2 PrecisionMed Inc., San Diego, CA, USA Dementia affects about 10% of the population over the age of 65 and can result from various neuropathological conditions. Currently, there is no way to differentiate specific forms of dementia (Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, etc.) prior to autopsy. PDI has discovered an 8-metabolite biomarker panel within the serum of patients with AD, non-AD dementia and healthy non-demented controls that can simultaneously differentiate the type of dementia and identify cognitive impairment using a non-targeted metabolomics technology based a Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FTICR-MS). The accurate measurement of the metabolite mass is sufficient to elucidate its molecular formula, thereby leading to metabolite identification, explication of biological significance and efficient biomarker validation. The 8-metabolite biomarker panel could provide a non-invasive method to aid in the diagnosis of specific subtypes of dementia. The development of a high throughput assay for these markers will also be presented. Neurons become photosensitive by genetically introducing one of green algae-derived protein, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). In this study, we quantitatively investigated the rapidness of the light-gated current of ChR2 expressed in PC12 cells using blue LED light. The light-gated current consists of two components, inactivating and noninactivating. The magnitude of inactivating component was almost linearly related to the light intensity. The non-inactivating component showed the tendency to saturate at high illumination. We also found that the activation rate is about 10-fold faster than the inactivating rate, but both are linearly dependent on the light intensity. Since the photoactivated current was very rapid in both onset and offset, the neuronal firings were phase-locked to short light pulses in an acute slice of hippocampus. It is suggested that the genetic expression of ChR2 is one of the most ideal photostimulation methods of a genetically identified neuron with defined activity patterns in intact nervous system.",

Proteomics analysis showed different effects of E2 for hypothalamic and cortical cells. In order to relate cellular brain structure to function, it is necessary to manipulate neural circuits at the level of individual cell types. Genetic methods for neuronal inactivation combined with cell-typespecific promoters will achieve this goal. Here, we have developed a genetic method for quickly and reversibly inactivating in vivo mammalian neurons using allatostatin receptor (AlstR), which causes neuronal hyperpolarization when treated with peptide ligand allatostatin (AL). In rat barrel cortex neurons expressing AlstR, AL reversibly inactivated neuronal activity evoked by electrical stimulation of the whisker pad. Both inactivation and recovery were seen within several minutes. We also confirmed the effectiveness of the AL/AlstR system in ferret visual cortex, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and monkey LGN. Therefore, the AL/AlstR system will be a powerful tool to investigate neuronal circuits and function. Prospective purification of neural stem cells (NSC) through the specific cell surface marker is crucial for functional recovery of the damaged brain. In the last meeting, we showed that living NSC were enriched from mouse whole brain as positive cells for erythro-phytohemagglutinin (E-PHA), which binds to complex type Asparagine-linked oligosaccharide (N-glycans). In this study, by using FACS system, we found that high selective affinity of E-PHA binding to the brain cells; E-PHA negative cells were neurons, mid-positive cells were NSC, and highly positive cells were endothelial cells, respectively. Ligand blot analysis revealed the existence of the E-PHA binding proteins different from the known selective NSC markers in E14 days brain homogenate, suggesting that N-glycosylated proteins could be distinctive markers for NSC.",

We examined the efficacy and safety of 17-AAG in a mouse model of SBMA. Administration of 17-AAG significantly ameliorated polyQ-mediated motor neuron degeneration by preferential proteasome degradation of mutant AR. The ability of 17-AAG to preferentially degrade mutant protein would be directly applicable to SBMA and other neurodegenerative diseases. Modulation of Hsp90 function by 17-AAG has emerged as a candidate of molecular targeted therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. The avian embryo has long been a popular and an excellent model for studying vertebrate development because of its classical manipulative advantages. In the present study, we tried to develop regulated gene transfer by using the tet regulatory system in the chick. The reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator was expressed under the control of the motor neuron (MN) specific HB9 promoter. Tetracycline responsive elements were used for inducible GFP expression. After these constructs were introduced into neural tube by in ovo electroporation, GFP expression was induced in spinal MNs in the presence of doxycycline. Approximately 5-20% of MN express GFP very intensely whereas the remaining MNs never express GFP, suggesting that, although the transgene is induced in limited numbers of MNs, once activated, cells express a large amount of the protein product of the experimental gene. Thus, this strategy can be applicable for a variety of experiments that require specially and temporally regulated gene expression in the chicken embryo.",

Most CA neurons are localized in the brainstem and hypothalamic regions and typically make clusters of cells, among which the noradrenergic (A1, A2 and A6) and dopaminergic (A9, A10 and A12) neurons predominate. In order to explore functional roles of these neurons, we collected CA neurons selectively using tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice in which GFP was expressed under the control of TH gene promoter. In fetal mice, most GFP-positive neurons expressed TH-immunoreactivity in limited brain regions including the locus coeruleus (LC). Therefore, LC-containing region was dissected under fluorescent microscopy, and neurons were dispersed by treating with trypsin, then GFP-positive cells were sorted out by flow-cytometry (FACS). RNA was extracted from the GFP-positive (TH) neurons, reverse-transcribed, and analyzed by PCR. Atg4B has been shown to play an important role in the processing of LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Atg8, but the tissue distribution of Atg4B remains unknown. To understand the role of Atg4B in rat tissue cells, we prepared an antibody to Atg4B and PC12 cells in which Atg4B expression was knocked down by RNAi. In RNAitreated PC12 cells where Atg4B expression was 10% of that in the wild-type PC12 cells, the expression of cytosolic LC3-I was similar to that in wild-type cells. The knockdown cell lysates, however, suppressed cleavage of proLC3 to LC3-I. Moreover, the expression of Atg4B mRNA was high in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb, while its protein was evenly distributed in the brain. Immunostaining for Atg4B was intense in neurons, especially in the cerebellum. These results suggest that Atg4B plays a major role in the processing of LC3, while autophagy is deeply associated with the metabolism in neurons, especially in the cerebellum.",

VSV-G achieves a broad transduction spectrum and lentiviral vectors provide an efficient vehicle to integrate transgenes into dividing and non-dividing cells. Thus, VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vectors with ubiquitous promoters, such as human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) promoter, infect and express transgenes in neuronal and glial cells. The purpose in this study is to explore neuron-specific promoters and to quantitatively examine their characteristics. At first, we used five kinds of well-known neuron-specific promoters; hSYN1, rTa1, mCaMKII, rNSE and hPDGF promoters. Then, we developed new hybrid promoters by a combination sequence of hCMV enhancer and neuron-specific promoters listed above. All of the new hybrid promoters dramatically improved expression of reporter gene (GFP), but the specificity deteriorated in the rat striatum, thalamus and neocortex. Although green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a useful tool to label living neurons, neuronal processes are not completely labeled with GFP.",

Myristoylated GFP (myrGFP) was efficiently localized at the plasma membrane of infected neurons, but not palmitoylated GFP. Since myrGFP was located at both dendritic and axonal membranes, we further added the putative dendrite-targeting or basolateral targeting signals, such as C-terminals of telencephalin (TLC), Fc \u2425 II \u2424 receptor (FcR), polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIgR), and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), to C-terminal of myrGFP, and compared their efficiency on dendrite targeting. Recently, we developed recombinant rabies virus vectors which were expected to act as a potential neurotracing tool. The vectors infected neurons specifically from axon terminals and were transported to the downstream neurons trans-synaptically. By using two different recombinant vectors, each of which expresses reporter protein of different kind, we attempted double labeling of a neuron. It was expected that we could detect and visualize the divergence or convergence of a neurocircuit. In the study, we could demonstrate the efficiency of double labeling in vivo. In the present study, we examined the potential of this technique particularly in terms of the quantitative detection of double labeled neurons in complicated neurocircuit.

The glycine-induced current was strychnine-sensitive and reversed in polarity at a membrane potential, close to the equilibrium potential of chloride ions.

Electrophysiological recordings from CA1 hippocampal neurons overexpressing \u2426-catenin demonstrated that \u2426catenin increased the AMPA receptor-mediated EPSC but had no significant effect on the NMDA receptor-medicated EPSC. The effect of \u2426-catenin on the AMPAR-EPSC was medicated by its PDZ ligand.

Here the DA system was investigated in another WM-involved pathway from mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) to PFC. Preliminarily, local perfusion of the D1 antagonist SCH23390 into PFC by using a microdialysis method impaired MD-PFC LTP but the D2 antagonist sulpiride did not. Extracellular DA levels in the PFC robustly increased after the tetanus of MD (by 110-120%). As a result both excitatory synaptic inputs to the PFC involved the WM-related DA profile, implying DA system enables a contrast-emphasis for cooperative crosstalk among several neuroplasticities in the PFC to selectively store intersectional information of multiple brain areas. Neuronal activity is necessary for postnatal maturation of synaptic connections only grossly laid out in the neonatal brain. In sensory cortices, synaptic maturation involves strengthening of sensory-evoked responses and development of receptive field (RF) maps with defined RF size and shape. Evoked activity is thought to shape synaptic maturation in sensory cortices by mechanisms of competitive Hebbian plasticity. Dendritic excitability, mediated by voltage-gated Na + channels, is required for active backpropagation of axosomatic action potentials (APs) and initiation of dendritic spikes; backpropagating APs and dendritic spikes enable forms of synaptic Hebbian plasticity, such as spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Here we examined the role of dendritic excitability in synaptic maturation of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the rat somatosensory barrel cortex. In the present study we compared LTP induction in neocortex of Captreated and normal rats in present of GABA antagonist, Picrotoxin (PTX). The result of present experiment showed that PTX plays an important facilitatory role in the induction of LTP in both normal and Cap-treated group. In Cap-treated group, in present of PTX, the LTP responses significantly were higher than normal group. We conclude that the enhancement of LTP by PTX can be explained by product of competition between excitatory and inhibitory pathways or synapses. These results suggest that GABAergic system has an important role in synaptic plasticity. Also, these results indicated that GABAergic inhibition has been increased in Cap-treated group.",

In the present study, using a minimal stimulation method, we recorded somatic IPSCs from layer 5 pyramidal cells in visual cortical slices prepared from rats at SWS like state under urethane anesthesia and in those prepared from rats at arousal state. The average amplitude of somatic IPSCs recorded in slices from the former group was significantly larger than that recorded in slices from the latter group. The mean rise time, decay time constant of IPSCs and the mean input resistance of the cells were not significantly different between these two groups. The present results further confirmed that the somatic inhibition in neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons is bidirectionally modified in accordance with behavioral state. Corticothalamic fibers (CT), originated from cerebral layer 6 pyramidal cells, make excitatory synapses with both thalamic relay neurons and reticular neurons. Since these pyramidal cells abundantly express kainate receptors (KARs) mRNA, we studied the effect of kainate on the presynaptic function of the two CT synapses in mouse thalamic VB nucleus. Bath application of kainate (200 nM) depressed CT-EPSCs and increased the paired pulse ratio in relay neurons. In contrast, kainate at the same concentration facilitated CT-EPSCs and decreased the paired pulse ratio in reticular neurons. These results suggested that KARs differentially regulated release at the two CT synapses. Furthermore, high frequency stimulation of CT depressed relay cell synapses but facilitated reticular cell synapses. Blocking endogenous KARs abolished these effects. Because reticular cells are the main source of inhibitory input to relay neurons, we suggested that endogenous KARs presynaptically regulate the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to thalamic relay neurons. To examine the involvement of NTR1 in the regulatory mechanisms for LTP in the amygdala, we utilized NTR1-knockout (KO) mice. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from the pyramidal neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), where DA-NT neurons project. We found that the BLA-LTP, induced by LA stimulation, was significantly greater in NTR1-KO mice than in wild-type mice. The BLA-LTP in NTR1-KO mice was attenuated by sulpiride, a D2 receptor antagonist. These results suggest that D2-NTR1 interaction regulates the extent of LTP in the mouse LA-BLA synapses.",

Apart from that, TNF\u2423, an inflammatory cytokine, has also been suggested to serve neuroprotective roles. The present study evaluated motor function recovery after controlled cortical impact (CCI) brain injury, and also the facilitation of plasticity by biotin dextran amine (BDA) axonal tracing in TNF\u2423KO mice and wild type (wt) mice. Mice were subjected to left sided CCI or served as sham controls, and were evaluated by composite neuroscore and rotarod over 28-day period. BDA was injected in right cerebral cortex to observe new axonal connections. So far, we observed recovery of motor function in wt mice, whereas TNF\u2423KO mice showed continuous functional deficit. We also observed greater number of new axonal connections in wt mice. Our results suggest that TNF\u2423 is necessary for functional recovery after brain injury, and axonal plasticity may be the mechanism involved. Disuse of synaptic activity causes homeostatic adaptation presynaptically and/or postsynaptically. Here we show that in hippocampal autaptic cultured neurons tetrodotoxin-induced chronic inactivity increases the fraction of high vesicular release probability pool with the entire readily releasable vesicle pool size remained intact. Kinetics of short-term plasticity and unchanged apparent Ca 2+ sensitivity indicate that TTX-induced presynaptic modification is unlikely due to an increase in the fusion rate crucial for the Ca 2+ at the final fusion step. In addition, analysis of neurons genetically lacked the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin-1, and timing-dependent rescues using two different viruses provide a novel conception, namely, vesicle machinery requires prolonged period so that the fast burst vesicle pool orchestrates presynaptic homeostasis system underlying \"vesicle mobilization\".",

The SpH fluorescence at individual mossy fiber terminal was increased by nerve stimulation and was followed by its reduction which is blocked by bafilomycin A1, a vesicular H+-ATPase inhibitor.

To further establish the functional significance of PSA-NCAM molecule, we have studied the expression of PSA-NCAM on GnRH axon terminals and glial cells in the proestrous phase of cycling rats as well as GABA and PBZ treated proestrous rats by using dual immunohistofluorescent staining. Both GnRH and PSA-NCAM immunostaining was much higher in proestrous phase rats, whereas, GABA and PBZ treatments significantly reduced their expression.

We investigated supragranular LTP and two types of supragranular LTD in the slices obtained from the rat auditory cortex, and compared their properties. Frontal cortical slices were prepared from male Wister rats. Supragranular field potentials elicited by the stimulation applied to layer VI were recorded. LTP was induced by tetanic stimulation (TS, 100 Hz for 1 s) applied to layer VI. LTD was induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS, 1 Hz for 900 s) applied to layer VI. LTD was also induced by TS applied to supragranular layers near the recording site. LFS-induced LTD and TS-induced LTD were completely abolished in the presence of 50 M APV, 3 M bicuculline, but not 500 M MCPG. LFS-induced LTD and TS-induced LTD occluded each other, suggesting that that both types of LTD share cellular and molecular mechanisms.",

Most of the evoked IPSCs were blocked by bicuculline confirming GABAergic identity. When nicotine (5-100 M) or capsaicin (0.1-1 M) was applied to AP neurons, robust appearance of IPSCs with GABAergic identity was induced. After blocking action potential generation in the slice with tetrodotoxin (1 M), nicotine and capsaicin could still induce GABAergic IPSCs. Interestingly, responses to capsaicin of the synaptic facilitation showed marked desensitization even after 5 min of rigorous washout. It is concluded that nicotinic receptors, as well as capsaicin receptors (presumably, TRPV1), are expressed at GABAergic presynaptic terminals in area postrema neurons and play a distinctive role in controlling autonomic neural functions.",

There are mainly two classes of GluRs, containing either GluRIIA or IIB. GluRIIA has a sequence predicted as Ca 2+ -permeable site. When CaMKII was inhibited by the expression of inhibitory peptide, Ala, the content of GluRIIA in synapses was dramatically increased and the mean amplitude of extrajunctional potential (EJP) was enhanced. The expression of constitutively active form of CaMKII (T287D) resulted in decreased GluRIIA content and enhanced GluRIIB content. Although miniature EJP amplitude was reduced, EJP amplitude was normal in T287D expressing larvae, suggesting the existence of some homeostatic mechanisms.

LTP expression can be regulated by previous synaptic activity, a process known as \"metaplasticity.\" We report a novel form of cellwide metaplasticity in hippocampal area CA1. Serine protease, Neuropsin, is involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Neuropsin increased the stability of LTP induced later at the same inputs via L-type VDCC. Moreover, neuropsin-deficient mice impaired L-LTP induction by l-TBS. Our findings have revealed the effects of neuropsin on the conversion of E-LTP to L-LTP. PTP, a form of presynaptic short-term plasticity, is mediated by a transient increase in transmitter release probability caused by tetanic stimulation. Although it has been known that PTP is induced by the elevation of presynaptic Ca 2+ , the molecular mechanism of PTP is poorly understood. In order to elucidate the specific role of presynaptic TrkB receptors in PTP, we analyzed PTP using hippocampal slices from conditionally gene-targeted mice in which the knockout of the trkB gene is restricted to presynaptic sites in the CA1 region. We found that PTP induced by the 100-Hz tetanus was reduced in mutant mice, and that PTP in control mice was partially reduced by an N-type Ca 2+ channel blocker, while PTP in mutant mice was unaltered by the blocker. Thus, these data suggest that the N-type Ca 2+ channel-dependent component of PTP requires TrkB receptor activation.",

Phgdh immunoreactivity was detected in M\u00fcller cell soma in internal nuclear layer, being close to internal plexiform layer. Immunopositive profiles were cellular processes surrounding rod spherules and retinal neurons in internal nuclear layer through nerve fiber layer. It was suggested that M\u00fcller cells contribute in L-Ser synthesis and its transportation to neurons in the retina. Astrocytes frequently show spontaneous intracellular Ca 2+ signals, such as intra-and intercellular Ca 2+ waves; however, their physiological roles remain elusive. The overexpression of an IP 3 -hydrolyzing enzyme, IP 3 5-phosphatase, suppressed the spontaneous Ca 2+ signals in rat hippocampal astrocytes in culture without noticeable effects on their viability. Hippocampal neurons were cultured on a monolayer of astrocytes, and their neurite outgrowth was analyzed.",

To address the role of Pax6 in the astrocytes, we examined the morphology of the astrocytes in the wild type (WT) and Pax6 heterozygote mutant (Sey/+) mice at 8 weeks. Confocal imaging revealed that arborization and extension of the astrocytes were poor in Sey/+ mice as compared with the WT. In primary culture, the astrocytes isolated from Sey/Sey cortex showed no morphological difference. However, 6 and 24 h after dibutyryl-cAMP treatment, the majority of the WT astrocytes had undergone the conversion from a polygonal to stellate shape, while Sey/Sey astrocytes rarely showed this response. These results suggest that Pax6 regulates the morphology of astrocytes, thereby being involved in astroglial functions. We raised mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) DIM21 to study its distribution and function in cell membrane and found not only its preferential reaction with PtdGlc on TLC, but also its labeling in rodent CNS (Yamazaki et al., 2006) . We previously reported a unique expression of DIM21 Ag in developing mouse brain, especially in cell membranes of embryonic radial glia (Kinoshita et al., 2005) . We show here that mAb DIM21 also recognizes adult neural stem cells and glial cells at postnatal period. DIM21, BrdU and GFAP co-expressed in cells of mouse neurogenic subventricular zone. We discuss a possibility that the DIM21 Ag may be expressed in the radial glia/astrocyte lineage cells. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors are thought to have a role in neural patterning of early neuronal development. The BMP receptor is widely expressed throughout the central nervous system (CNS) including cerebellum. However, the physiological roles of BMP signaling in mature brain remains obscure. To understand BMP function in CNS, we generated a transgenic mouse line that conditionally overexpresses BMP signaling through the type I receptor ALK2 (alternatively known as AVCRI) in a Purkinje cell-specific manner using a Cre-loxP system. We bred this mouse line with the Cre transgenic mouse line of which expression was driven by L7 promoter. Tissue specificity of Cre recombination was monitored by a bicistronically expressed EGFP following a constitutively active Alk2 cDNA. Increased BMP signaling was confirmed by ectopic phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 (P-smads) in Purkinje cells. We will discuss functional changes of the purkinje cells which receive excess amount of BMP signaling through ALK2. Lipopolysaccharide component of the cell wall of certain bacteria is pyrogenic whose administration to spinal cord injured animals was found to inhibit glial scar formation. Glial scar being considered as an impediment for axonal growth, it had been proposed in 1950s and 1960s that sub-febrile doses of pyrogen could be considered for spinal cord injury repair research. We tested this ignored hypothesis in paraplegic bonnet monkeys and found that such sub-febrile doses of bacterial pyrogen derived from Salmonella typhi was indeed effective in preventing the glial scar formation in short-term and at least prolong the formation of such scar in long term. Therefore, pyrogen therapy may be considered as an adjunct to other strategies such as transplantation approaches to treat spinal cord injury.",

Here contribution of glial cells in 6-OHDA induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons was investigated. Glial cultures showed significant loss in cell viability after 48 h (34 and 19%) and 72 h (56 and 33%) exposure to 10 \u22124 and 10 \u22125 M 6-OHDA respectively. It was accompanied by morphological changes and induction of GFAP, S-100 and OX42. 6-OHDA (10 \u22126 M, 72 h) was found to cause a significant impairment in 3 H glutamic acid uptake (31%) and GSH levels (27%). Further neurons (in coculture with 6-OHDA pre exposed glial cells) on exposure to 6-OHDA (10 \u22126 M), showed loss of TH expression and significant neuronal cell death (34%). The results of the present study suggest that 6-OHDA may impair glial cell functioning, which eventually affect neuronal fate making them more vulnerable toward toxic insults. Nestin is an embryonic intermediate filament component, which is transiently expressed by the immediate precursors to neurons and glia during brain development. We studied nestin distribution in the olfactory system after injection of diethyldithiocarbamate in adult rats to cause reversible lesion of the olfactory epithelium (OE). The OE presented a near-complete destruction at 1 day after injection, then started to repair at 3 days and returned to the normal levels at 6 weeks. Nestin was expressed in olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) of the olfactory mucosa at 3\u223c7 days, but not in those of the olfactory bulb (OB). Simultaneously strong expression of nestin was detected in certain population of astrocytes in glomeruli. The reversion of astrocytes in glomeruli to immature phenotype may reflect their involvement in reinnervation of glomeruli. (NG2) is currently considered a marker of multipotent progenitor cells in the brain. In the present study, most Iba1+ cells accumulated in stab wounds and ischemic lesions were found to express NG2, of which molecular weight of its core protein was higher by 10 kDa than that of NG2 expressed in contralateral brain region. This was due to the lack of shedding of NG2 in the brain lesions. We found that Iba1+ cells accumulated in stab wounds and ischemic core lesion, most of which were NG2+/PDGFRa+. Furthermore, some of these cells expressed GFAP, nestin, CD163 and von Willebrand factor. NG2+ MG isolated from stab wounds often formed cell aggregates bearing alkaline phosphatase activity turned into cells with neuroectodermal phenotypes in serumfree culture medium. These variety of antigens expressed by NG2+ MG in brain lesions may be related to their multipotentiality to regenerate damaged brain tissue.",

So, in the present study, neural and the connective tissue organization of the extradural part of the ON from 20 cadavers were studied. Light microscopy revealed multi-fascicular nerve with myelinated fibers of various calibers. Small sized myelinated fibers were noted at the junction of the central and the paracentral zone of most of the nerves. Using unbiased stereology techniques the size of myelinated fiber axonal areas showed a multi-modal distribution and presented range from <1 to 40 m 2 . Most of the fibers were myelinated and counts produced a mean of 16,891 (12,000-21,500). Ultrastructurally, difference in the compactness of arrangement of connective tissue was observed with advancing age. The cell junctions of the perineurial cells and the endoneurial capillaries were observed. Myelin thickness ranged from 0.29 to 3.16 m (from fetal age to 60 years age). During the development of the Drosophila visual system, retinal axons project to the optic lobe through the optic stalk. The optic stalk is composed of glial cells and adopts tube-like structure. FAK is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase involved in many aspects of cell behavior including cell migration through the regulation of actin or microtubule dynamics. In Drosophila FAK (Dfak) mutant animals, the optic stalk was abnormally broadened and retinal axons were defasciculated. CdGAPr encodes one of GAPs that regulate Rho-family GTPases. Putative CdGAPr mutants showed Dfak-like phenotype.",

Astrocytes are thought to be active participants in synaptic plasticity in the developing nervous system. Spontaneous GABAergic postsynaptic activity is reported to be decreased in small neurons of the caudal NTS at the end of the first postnatal week. To investigate whether astrocytes might be involved in this phenomenon, we examined developmental expression of GFAP, an astrocytic marker. GFAP began to be immunohistochemically expressed in the caudal NTS at P5-10. Costaining with calbindin, a marker for a certain type of small neurons, showed that GFAP positive processes were thereafter closely apposed to soma of small calbindin neurons. Electron microscopy showed that some astrocytic processes were interposed between orphan GABAergic varicosities and soma of small neurons at the specific developmental stages. These findings indicate that astrocytes may participate actively in regulating the postnatal differentiation of local neural network of the caudal NTS.",

Typical EEG patterns including theta (3-8 Hz) and sharp wave associated fast ripple (120-180 Hz) oscillations were observed in both populations and these patterns were indistinguishable between the WT and KO.

While both populations developed ictal event within 40 min, mean power during the development was significantly smaller in KO mice.

To determine whether the mutation alters the node of Ranvier, we performed morphological analysis of myelinated nerves in Shambling mice. By electron microscopy, we found that paranodal loops were disorganized and septate-like transverse bands were absent in mutant mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed that Caspr was diffusely located at the paranodal region, though the staining was extremely weak in mutant sciatic nerves. Contactin, a component of the paranodal junction, was distributed similar pattern to that of Capsr. Further, K + channels were mislocalized to the paranode, while Na + channels were normally restricted to the node. These findings suggest that the mutation disrupts the paranodal structure and may disturb salutatory conduction of myelinated nerves in Shambling mice.",

MALDI-QIT/TOF MS n analyses revealed that one of molecules was 2 ,3 -cyclic nucleotide 3phosphodiesterase (CNP). Immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical studies showed that Rip-antigen colocalized with CNP in rat cerebellum, cultured rat oligodendrocytes and CG-4 cells. Moreover, the same localization was also observed in rat Cnp1 transfected HEK293T cells. Overall we first demonstrated that the antigen labeled with mAb-Rip is CNP in oligodendrocytes. The expression of BDNF gene is regulated by four promoters (pI-pIV), and is under activity-dependent control. Until now, it has been established that BDNF pI is activated by Ca 2+ signal via CRE. On the other hand, neuron-restrictive silencer cis-element (NRSE), located in BDNF pII, represses BDNF gene expression through binding NRSF and recruiting HDAC in non-neural cells. Here, we found that NRSE repressed the activity of BDNF pI in neuron. Using RT-PCR and ChIP assay, the BDNF exon I expression and the histone acetylation of BDNF pI were increased by the administration of Ca 2+ signals or HDAC inhibitor. In addition, NRSF bound to BDNF pII in neurons but was detached by Ca 2+ signals. These results suggest that BDNF pI activity is regulated by CREB and NRSF through an alteration of chromatin structure. Since CREB and NRSF are playing an important role in neuronal differentiation, it is considered that the BDNF pI is deeply involved in the regulation of neurogenesis.",

This change was in its dose-dependent manner and blocked by co-application of a cholesterol synthesis inhibitors. To understand the molecular relationship between cholesterol content and synapse development, we estimated the amount of cholesterol and SV proteins in lipid raft fractions prepared from cultured cortical neurons. The results indicated that BDNF treatment increased the amount of cholesterol and SV proteins in lipid rafts, but not in non-rafts fraction. These data suggested a possibility that BDNF regulated synapse development by increasing the amount of cholesterol and SV proteins in synaptic rafts.

To ascertain the function of p38 on these cells, we treated the cultured E14 cells with the selective chemical inhibitor for p38 (SB203580) for 7 days, and determined the number of neural progenitor cells.

Recently, we have shown that Cbln1 is secreted from cerebellar granule cells (GC) and controls synaptic structure and plasticity of GC-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses. However, because Cbln1 was previously shown to serve as a precursor of a PC-specific peptide cerebellin, it remains unclear whether Cbln1 needs to be processed before it trans-synaptically activates signaling pathways in PC. Here, we show that purified recombinant Cbln1 proteins, which formed a hexamer, preferentially bound to spines on PC dendrites. Furthermore, Cbln1 mutants that did not form a hexamer lost the binding affinity to PC spines. Although cerebellin peptide may also contribute to different aspects of signaling, these results indicate that Cbln1 released from GC directly bind to postsynaptic PC as a hexamer and activates signaling pathways in PC. Activity-dependent gene expression in neurons contributes to expressing a variety of neuronal functions including a long-lasting neuronal plasticity. Recently, we found that specific kinds of mRNA can be stabilized in an activity-dependent manner. To elucidate the mechanisms for activity-dependent mRNA stabilization, we have focused on BDNF, which is a member of neurotrophin family and plays an important role in exerting neuronal functions. We constructed firefly luciferase gene fused to 3 -untranslated region (UTR) of BDNF mRNA to investigate the effect of the 3 UTR on the calcium signal-mediated mRNA stabilization. In cultured neurons, we found that the degradation of firefly luciferase-BDNF3 UTR mRNA induced by the treatment with actinomycin D was prevented by calcium signals evoked via L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-VDCCs) and NMDA receptors. We are now investigating to identify the cis-regulatory elements involved in the calcium signal-mediated stabilization of BDNF mRNA using a series of mutant BDNF3 UTR. Recently, it has been established that BDNF and PACAP regulate the expression of a group of genes which encode proteins involved in expressing neuronal functions. In this study, we found that the treatment of cultured rat cortical neurons with BDNF or PACAP acutely induced the mRNA expression of the activityregulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) and homer1a, whose products are necessary for the synaptic plasticity. BDNF induced Arc mRNA expression through the activation of TrkB-ERK/MAPK pathway, whereas PACAP induced it partly through the activation of NMDA-receptors. Using Affymetrix GeneChips, we are now investigating a comprehensive profile of gene expression controlled by BDNF or PACAP in cultured rat cortical neurons.",

Although BMP4 expression has been well described in the early development of central nervous system (CNS), little information is available for its expression in the adult CNS. We, thus, investigated BMP4 expression in the adult rat CNS using immunohistochemistry. BMP4 is intensely expressed in most neurons and their dendrites. In addition, intense BMP4 expression was also observed in the neuropil of the gray matters where high plasticity is reported, such as the molecular layer of the cerebellum and the superficial layer of the superior colliculus. Furthermore, we found that astrocytes also express BMP4 protein. These data indicate that BMP4 is more widely expressed throughout the adult CNS than previously reported, and its continued abundant expression in the adult brain strongly supports the idea that BMP4 plays pivotal roles also in the adult brain.",

Med., Osaka, Japan HGF is a novel neurotrophic factor in vitro on DA neurons. However, little is known about expression and biological activities of HGF in nigral-striatal system in vivo. Here we show that HGF is a targetderived trophic factor for rat DA system. Real-time RT-PCR revealed that c-met mRNA was expressed in substantia nigra (SN) and striatum (STR), while HGF mRNA was expressed in STR but not in SN in programmed cell death period. HGF, c-Met, phospho-c-Met, TH, DA transporter immunostaining revealed the presence of concentration gradient of HGF from SN to STR and c-Met was phosphorylated in DA nerve end during early postnatal development. Phospho-c-Metpositive DA neurons decreased at later developmental stage, while it became prominent in oligodendrocytic leanage. HGF application into STR increased DA neuronal number and neurites and modified oligodendrocyte maturation, while opposite effects were observed by the application of blocking antibody for HGF. Therefore, HGF may be a critical trophic factor for nigro-striatal DA system development. The neuroprotective effects of G-CSF were reported in neurological disease models. In the present study, we examined whether G-CSF can protect dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-induced cell death in a PD. The mice were intraperitoneal injected with MPTP for five consecutive days, G-CSF is intraperitoneal administered two days and one day before first MPTP injection, and 30 min before each MPTP injection. In our results, G-CSF significantly prevented MPTPinduced loss of TH-positive neurons, and increased Bcl-2 protein, decreased Bax protein expression. These findings suggest that G-CSF has therapeutic potentiality to protect MPTP-induced cell death through increasing the level of bcl-2 expression, decreasing the level of Bax expression in C57BL/6 mice.",

However, the ability of Ast to produce/secrete NTF has not been accurately known. Thus, in the present study, we investigate the capacity of Ast to produce/secrete various NTF in vitro. Ast were prepared from the mother culture of neonatal rat brain. The NTF in the conditioned medium (CM) were detected by immunoblotting. The analysis of neurotrophins in the CM revealed that Ast produce/secrete NGF, BDNF and NT-3, and promote the production of them by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, TGF\u24242 among TGF\u2424 family was detected in the CM of Ast, and the production was enhanced by stimulation with LPS.

Cultured neurons (12 DIV) exposed to glutamate for 15 min at 100 M. Glutamate exposure led to a decrease in mRNA of ND1 and ND6, which are subunits of NADHubiquinone oxidoreductase, before cell death. Since mtRNAs level is regulated at least in part by RNA degradation mediated by RNase-L, we next examined the effect of glutamate on expression of RNase-L. RT-PCR analysis revealed that glutamate was effective in increasing the level of RNase-L mRNA at least 2-12 h after treatment. The increase in the expression of RNase-L was abolished by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801.

Neurotoxicity of maneb (1 g/ml) on the PC12 cells was elicited through apoptotic cell death. Activation of caspase-3/7 was associated with this process. A fluorescence rationing technique using mitochondrial dye revealed that maneb altered mitochondrial membrane potential of the neural cells.

The C-terminal domain of KIF4 is a module that suppresses the activity of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), a nuclear enzyme known to maintain cell homeostasis by repairing DNA and serving as a transcriptional regulator. When neurons are stimulated by membrane depolarization, calcium signaling mediated by CaMKII induces dissociation of KIF4 from PARP-1, resulting in upregulation of PARP-1 activity, which supports neuron survival. After dissociation from PARP-1, KIF4 enters into the cytoplasm from the nucleus, and moves to the distal part of neurites in a microtubule-dependent manner. We suggested that KIF4 controls the activity-dependent survival of postmitotic neurons by regulating PARP-1 activity in brain development.",

TMT (2.8 mg/kg) was systemically injected into mice, and then an immunohistchemical analysis was performed to identify cells immunoreactive to antibodies against HSPs, NeuN, and GFAP in coronal sections of hippocampus. TMT was effective in enhancing the expression of HSP105, APG-1, and APG-2 in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, but not in CA1-CA3 pyramidal cell layer, 16 h to 2 days later. Double staining of NeuN and these HSPs revealed that these HSPs expressed by TMT almost co-localized with NeuN in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Whereas HSP105 highly expressed in survival neurons in the culture, APG-1 and APG-2 highly expressed in damaged neurons with nuclear condensation. Taken together, the high-molecular-weight HSPs may be involved in neuronal survival and damage caused by TMT. Brain irradiation is often performed in patients with brain tumors. However, little has been known about radiosensitivity of neurons, especially in the developmental stages. In this study, we investigated the effect of irradiation on immature neurons with that on mature neurons. Primary neuronal cultures were prepared from fetal rat hippocampi at embryonic day 18. Thirty gray of X-irradiations were performed on the cultured cells at 7 or 21 days in vitro (DIV). Then the cells were fixed at 24 h after the irradiation with DAPI. At 7-DIV, irradiation significantly increased the number of nuclear pyknosis of neurons. In contrast, radiation did not induce any nuclear pyknosis of neurons at 21-DIV. This indicates that the radiosensitivity of 7-DIV immature neurons is higher than that of 21-DIV mature neurons. Glutamate receptors are believed to be involved in various neurological disorders via its excitotoxicity. Ataxic mice Lurcher (Lc) are caused by a mutation in the \u24262 glutamate receptor (GluR\u24262), which shows constitutive channel activities in Purkinje cells and leads to the cell death. Thus, Lc is the first example of neurodegeneration caused by chronic excitotoxicty. Interestingly, GluR\u24262 is also suggested to regulate autophagy via its association with Beclin. However, it is unclear how excitation caused by constitutive channel activities is related to the autophagic pathway and cell death. Here, using heterologous cells in vitro, we show that continuous influx of Na + , but not Ca 2+ , was necessary and sufficient to induce autophagic cell death.",

We have also found that various NF-kB subunits and IkB-a aberrantly interacts with the expanded polyglutamine proteins and associates with their aggregates. Finally, we have shown several NF-kB-dependent genes are down-regulated in the expanded polyglutamine protein expressing cells. Molecular mechanisms for selective neuronal death in polyglutamine diseases remain to be clarified. By microarray analysis, we compared gene expression profiles in cerebellar granular cells under expression of normal and mutant ataxin-1 and found a novel gene down-regulated in response to mutant ataxin-1 in cerebellar granular neurons. We named the novel gene Maxcell (mutant ataxin-affected gene in the cerebellum). Nothern blot shows that Maxcell mRNA in human brain is expressed in cerebellum and cerebral cortex. Immunohistochemistry with anti-Maxcell antibody shows cytoplasmic stains of neurons but not glial cells in mouse brain. Confocal microscopy shows that Maxell-EGFP is colocalized with ribosomal protein s6 as a ribosomal marker. We are analyzing the function of Maxcell protein that might relate to SCA1 molecular pathology.",

The spinal cord is more traumatized than the brain during the extraction because it takes more time. In order to minimize confounding factors, we induced severe hypothermia in animals prior to removal of tissue and isolation of mitochondria. Sensitivity to Ca 2+ -induced mPT was evaluated in brain and spinal mitochondria in energized and de-energized model of swelling with or without mPT inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA). The present findings imply that the general features of mPT are similar in brain and spinal cord mitochondria and that mPT may be an important pharmacological target in disorders affecting the spinal cord. The role of cyclophosphamide monohydrate (CP), which is known as an immunosuppression drug, in the central nervous system (CNS) has not been elucidated. In the present study, we found that treatment with CP prevented the cultured cortical neurons from cell death induced by serum deprivation. Furthermore, CP exposure induced the activation of both the MAP kinase (MAPK) and PI3 kinase (PI3K) pathways. Interestingly the up-regulation of Bcl-2, a survival promoting molecule was observed after CP treatment. These observations suggest that CP protects CNS neurons from neuronal damage through intracellular signaling pathways. The research of cell death mechanisms has rapidly progressed. However, cell death is an inherently difficult process to measure. To investigate the roles of cell death in vivo, we introduced SCAT3 probe. SCAT3 is an indicator protein for caspase-3 activation that uses FRET between two types of fluorescent protein, ECFP and Venus, linked by a peptide containing the caspase-3 cleavage sequence. Using this probe, we could monitor the activation of caspase-3 at the singleneuron level in culture. We will discuss about neural cell death through the detection of caspase activity.",

In this study, we examined TMT-induced neuronal death in mouse primary cultured cortical neurons in vitro and the frontal cortex in vivo of mice. In vivo analysis using mice revealed that injection of TMT (2.8 mg/kg, i.p.) led to an increase in single-stranded DNA-positive cells, as well as in DNase II-positive cells, in the frontal cortex 2 days later. In cortical neurons, TMT exposure for 48 h led to a marked decrease in the cell viability, as well as to an increase in nuclear condensation and LDH released. TMT exposure was effective in activating DNase II in the nucleus. In addition, caspases 3 and 8, but not caspase 9, were significantly activated by TMT treatment. Cytochrome c release was not affected by TMT treatment. The caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK completely prevented TMT-induced neuronal death. These results suggest that TMT-induced neuronal death is involved in caspases and DNase II activated by mitochondria-independent pathway in cortical neurons. We investigated the pattern of hippocampal damage and the levels of brain polyamines after systemic injections of trimethyltin (TMT) chloride (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) in 3-(3W) and 7-week-old (7W) ICR mice. In addition, we measured the brain tin level following TMT injection. TMT induced marked, localized cell death in granule neurons of the dentate gyrus in 3W mice. By contrast, slight, diffuse neuronal damage was found in the CA1 and CA3 subfields and dentate gyrus of 7W mice. The hippocampal putrescine level was elevated markedly in 3W mice on TMT administration, whereas a minor putrescine increase was detected in 7W mice. There was no difference in the brain tin level between these two age groups. These results revealed the age-dependent vulnerability of mice hippocampal neurons to TMT administration, and suggest that massive activation of polyamine metabolism is associated with TMT-induced neurodegeneration.",

We examined an fMRI to evaluate the brain activation of tools-manipulation in 17 volunteers. Experiment was performed by three tasks, control task is a forearm rotation, Task1 is simulation of tools-manipulation, Task2 is execution of tools-manipulation. We found different brain regions by this experiment. Task2 To investigate the role of synchronous firing in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), we performed cross-corelational analysis of the PFC neurons, while monkeys performed a path-planning task, which required multiple steps of actions to reach goals. First, we analyzed synchrony among PFC neurons during the execution period in comparison with that during the preparatory period. We found that neuronal synchrony was enhanced transiently for each step of movement during the execution period. Next, we examined relationship between neuronal synchrony and task-related activities. We found that the relationship between neuronal synchrony and response selectivity of PFC neurons was more distinct during the preparatory period than during the execution period. We would discuss dynamical roles in neuronal synchrony in planning multiple steps of actions. The functional significance of primate medial prefrontal cortex in the selection of action has been unclear. We studied neuronal activity in this region while monkeys were performing a variant of conflict solving task in which visual cues instructed them to push either the left or right. The location of the cue was either compatible (congruent) or incompatible (incongruent) with the target's location. We found a focus of reaching-related neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex rostral to the pre-SMA. The activity of neurons in this newly identified area was dependent on conflict. Intracortical microstimulation in this area did not evoke eye movements, distinguishing this area from the SEF. We found that the local field potential in this area, but not in other areas, differed when congruent and incongruent trials were intermixed, and when only the congruent trials were presented repeatedly, suggesting the involvement of this area in the selection of actions is dependent on the task demand.",

Two paradigms were used, in Go-Only sessions saccade direction with the cue to move, and in Go/No Go sessions, saccade execution, direction and move. Mutual information (MI) analysis showed the two eyes were most consistently yoked for position than for velocity, but both provided adequate signals. MI showed coupling between the start and end of saccades and the importance of velocity signals in their ballistic nature. Surprisingly leftward movement latency was longer to peak-velocity and showed more complex MI interactions. Comparing Go-Only to Go/No Go saccades, significant differences were longer onset latencies and a higher eye velocity before the end of saccades. A recent MEG study using this protocol, found just before and during the saccade the additional Go/No Go difficulty led to more interaction between left and right brainstem and cerebellum. These could be related to eye velocity changes with the higher cognitive loading. Wriggle Mouse Sagami (WMS) has been presented as a mouse model for dystonia, as it is characterized by postural and motor impairments, such as sever tremor, sustained muscle contractions of the limbs, and wriggling of the neck and trunk without coordination.

In the basal ganglia (globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra pars reticulata), neither rates nor patterns of spike discharges were significantly different as compared to normal mice. On the other hand, the discharge rate of cerebellar Purkinje cells in WMS was markedly decreased.

Muscle voltage recordings confirmed that muscles on both sides of the trunk in beo are likely to receive simultaneous synaptic input from the CNS. Recordings from motor neurons revealed that glycinergic synaptic transmission was missing in beo mutants. Furthermore, immunostaining with GlyR antibody failed to show clusters in beo neurons. These data suggest that clustering defect of GlyRs at synapse causes the impairment of glycinergic transmission and abnormal behavior in beo. Indeed, mutations in the glycine receptor beta subunit were identified in beo. This is the first direct demonstration that GlyR\u2424 is essential for physiologically relevant clustering of GlyRs in vivo. Since glycine receptor mutations in humans lead to hyperekplexia, a motor disorder characterized by startle responses, zebrafish bandoneon mutant should be a useful animal model for this condition. Medium-sized spiny projection neurons in the striatum receive inputs from GABAergic and cholinergic interneurons as well as from extrinsic sources, including the cerebral cortex. In the present study, the effect of GABAergic modulation on striatal projection neuron activity was investigated by infusion of the GABA A receptor blocker gabazine in the vicinity of the recorded neurons in monkeys who performed a memory-guided reaching task. The gabazine infusion enhanced the activity of striatal projection neurons in response to both cortical stimulation and task events, while the neuronal activity specific to the task events was decreased. These results suggest that local GABAergic input may play an important role in fine tuning of striatal projection neuron activity.",

The evidence that the emergence of synchronized oscillatory activity in the network of the two nuclei is relevant to movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease shows temporal structures of the neuronal firings play an important role for the functions. Among possible underlying mechanisms for the abnormal activity, the characteristic membrane properties of STN neurons is likely to be one of the most crucial origins. To clarify the detailed mechanism, we focus on and investigate the dynamical properties of the neuron theoretically and numerically with the model neuron. We apply the phase reduction method to the dynamics of the neuron to analyze the stability of synchronous activity. In particular, how the stability depends on temporal characteristics of afferent inputs to the neurons as well as the intrinsic membrane properties are investigated. During phasic voluntary movement, electromagnetic oscillatory activities of \u223c20 Hz around the central sulcus show decrement and increment (ERD/ERS, respectively), that are assumed to reflect the cortical activation and inhibitory/recovery process respectively. We investigated the correlation between personality and these oscillatory changes. From 35 healthy subjects, high and low scorers (n = 12 each) of novelty seeking dimension on the psychometry were selected. Magnetic fields were recorded while they performed selfpaced movements of their right index fingers, and frequency analysis was carried through the beta band (18-24 Hz). High NS group showed less amount of ERD in the left hemisphere, smaller magnitude, larger latency of ERS in the right hemisphere and smaller amount of baseline activity in both hemispheres than low NS group. It was suggested that individuals with high NS trait may have less inhibition after the movement and higher readiness during resting state. Despite the emerging methodology of combined fMRI and TMS, the quantitative relationship between TMS intensity and BOLD signals is poorly understood. Eight healthy subjects were scanned on a 3-T scanner, with an MRI-compatible figure-of-eight TMS coil attached for eliciting right hand movement. BOLD measurement was performed with the stepping stone sequence (TR = 2.7 s) with online monitoring of MEPs. The intensity of TMS pulses was varied from 30% to 95% at a 5% step (frequency at \u223c0.15 Hz). BOLD signal changes were assessed in the primary motor cortex. A sharp increase in BOLD signals was observed above 80% stimulation. BOLD signals were weakly but significantly correlated with TMS intensity adjusted by the resting motor threshold (R = 0.46, P = 0.001). This finding gives a theoretical background for the application of fMRI with TMS to cognitive brain regions.",

While in MRI, online force feedback was provided by a 2D strain gauge. Twenty repetitions of each condition were performed in 12 s blocks (TR = 2 s). All subjects showed broad activation over the contralateral motor area, and from functional ROIs an average of 661 voxel time series were extracted. Many voxels exhibited continuous cosine-like tuning with movement direction. Decoding using linear SVM revealed that while correct classification rate was only 31.3% (chance: 14.3%), errors were distributed normally about the target such that 80.4% (chance: 59.2%) of the data was classified correctly to within 60 \u2022 . These data demonstrate that non-invasive neuroimaging is sufficiently sensitive to study the problem of coordinate system representation. The behavioral thermoregulation is important for living in various temperature environments. However, the neural mechanism of behavioral thermoregulation is poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to establish a new model to analyze the neural mechanism of behavioral thermoregulation using zebrafish. We investigated whether zebrafish perform behavioral thermoregulation against heating. When water temperature was changed from 28 \u2022 C, fish showed repetition of short time swimming in the range 32.5-40 \u2022 C. The frequency of the heat induced escape behavior was increased with temperature dependant. These results suggest that the heat induced escape behavior is a part of behavioral thermoregulation. The heat induced escape behavior was observed stably in 3-5 days past fertilization, indicating that the neural mechanism which control behavioral thermoregulation is matured in 3 days. In conclusion, we established an effective new model to analyze behavioral thermoregulation.",

First, motor adaptations to reach with a novel force field applied to a limb could not be fully transferred to the same limb across unimanual to bimanual conditions, and vice versa. Second, learning acquired during unimanual reaching could not be fully eliminated by repeated bimanual reaching with no loads, and vice versa. Rather, some learning remained intact (but invisible) until the original context was again performed. Lastly, two conflicting force fields can be learned simultaneously if they are separately associated with unimanual and bimanual reaching.

Recently the optimal feedback control hypothesis has given a significant impact on the motor control community because it produces an optimal behavior for a given task by avoiding offline computation of optimal desired trajectory that would result in suboptimal behavior in the presence of noise. It, however, requires considerable amount of resources and learning to realize multiple tasks on nonlinear system. On the other hand, a desired trajectory enables the brain to share resources with multiple tasks and save learning time by dividing a difficult problem into easier sub-problems of plan and execution. Considering the modularity of the brain and viability for nonlinear system, the hierarchical implementation is a better solution for global optimality as a versatile creature. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the hand variance modulation during multiple via-point tasks supports the existence of a desired trajectory. The purpose of this study is to computationally predict arm-reaching movements and posture controls from neuronal activity of premotor (PM) and primary motor area (MI). The activity was collected with single-unit recording method during the animal performing a visually guided arm-reaching task. Electromyograms (EMGs) and kinematics were also measured. We reconstructed the EMGs from the neuronal data using a linear regression model, and then we estimated the kinematics from the reconstructed EMGs with an artificial neural network model and proportional derivative controller. As a result, these serial processes allowed us to accurately predict the kinematics during both moving and maintaining her posture from the activity. The advantage of our BMI system is to estimate not only the kinematics but also the muscle tension from the neuronal activity. We have recently reported essential role of the tongue in breastfeeding in the hypoglossal (XII) nerve-injured newborn rats. Of particular interest were the findings that the rates of the amounts of milk intake in the unilateral XII nerve-injured P1 pups of the surviving cases increased greatly between P4 (30% of the control value) and P7 (52%), suggesting adaptive tongue movement during development. This study was undertaken to reveal underlying basic mechanisms for such adaptation focusing on neural plasticity allowing effective suckling. After resection of the ipsilateral XII nerve on P1, DiI, a postmortem neuronal tracer, was applied to the contralateral uninjured XII nerve of P4 and P7 pups. DiI-labeled neuronal fibers were successfully traced within the tongue and were found to extend over the XII nerve-injured side with gradual increase from P4 to P7. We show evidence for functional neural plasticity that allows effective suckling in the XII nerve-injured newborns with suckling disturbance. Previously we reported that decorticated rats showed abnormal righting movements in the air when dropped from the supine position, while the air righting reflex (ARR) could be evoked purposefully (180 \u2022 turn around the body axis) in decerebrated ones. Thus, the basal ganglia might send interference signals to the ARR center via the midbrain tegmentum. To clarify its functional roles in ARR control, we examined ARR movements in rats with the midbrain lesioned. Wistar, male rats were prepared; after the posterior cerebral cortex was removed by sucking, the superior colliculus and surrounding structures were ablated in various degrees. ARR movements were examined post-operative 1, 4, and 7 days. In rats with the superior colliculus lesioned extensively on both sides, ARR onset were delayed and body turn around the longitudinal axis was weakened, so that either insufficient or no rotation occurred in the air. Furthermore, coordination between the body and tail rotations was lost in many cases. The ablated region may relay cortical signals that give a top priority to the ARR center.",

In the feeding system of Aplysia kurodai, the LE neuron we identified produces the long-lasting plateau potentials and may be a CPG element. During the feeding-like responses duration of the depolarization of the follower neurons was shortened by hyperpolarization of the LE. In this study we found that the LE plateau potentials had refractory periods and they were turned to activation periods by application of large depolarizing currents. And various depolarizing pulses tended to produce the stable plateau potentials with almost constant depolarizing size and duration, suggesting that the LE can supply the constant long-lasting depolarizing outputs to the follower neurons even when it receives various length and intensity of excitatory inputs from the presynaptic neurons. The LE may be an important CPG element to determine the size and duration of the basic depolarization of many buccal neurons.",

On the other hand, a few animals with the Cortico-Medullary Projection Path can learn a new sound. In this research, we investigated about vocal control in PAG of social rodent, the Degu (Octodon degu). It is known that degus have fifteen kinds of vocal repertoires, and that their courtship song has a complex structure. We verified the hypothesis by electrical stimulation of the PAG that the neural mechanism of degus that enables complex vocalization differs from that of guinea pigs with simple vocalization. Guinea pig is near relation with Degu. As a result, in guinea pigs, each sound is controlled in different area of the PAG. In degus, however, multiple sounds are controlled by the same area, and the different sound was occasionally evoked by the different kind of stimulation. The sound with the time-series specific to the spontaneous vocalization of degu was not emitted. The effects of a heat-and steam-generating sheet (HSG sheet) on autonomic nerve activity and bowel movement were examined in women suffering irregular defecation, The HSG sheet was applied to the lumbar or abdominal regions, causing the temperature between the sheet and skin to increase to about 38.5 \u2022 C. Application of the HSG sheet to either the lumbar or abdominal region significantly increased the rate of miosis in the pupillary light reflex. As for changes in R-R, the HF increased after application, suggesting that the parasympathetic nerve system had become dominant. Bowel movement assessed by electrogastrography increased in amplitude. Based on the above findings, we concluded that the application of an HSG sheet to the lumbar or abdominal region may lead to dominant parasympathetic nerve activity and improve gastrointestinal motility.",

AQP1-immunoreactive (IR) neurons simultaneously expressed a neuronal marker HuC/D. Moderate numbers of AQP1-IR neuronal somata were found in the myenteric plexus, and a very few were found in the submucosal plexus. AQP1-IR neurons can be classified as Dogiel type I cells, which have several short processes and a single long process. Many AQP1-IR fibers were found both in the myenteric and submucosal plexi. Many AQP1-IR varicose fibers were closely associated with neuronal somata in the ganglia, whereas other AQP1-IR fibers penetrated into the muscle layers.

The increase in the volume and frequency setting of the artificial ventilator (FIO2 = 50%, FICO2 = 0%) failed to make the rat apnea. Under this condition, the phrenic nerve showed unstable rhythmic inspiratory bursts, and the tail pinch increased the respiratory frequency. Although the iliohypogastric nerve showed expiratory discharges, their amplitudes and shapes were not consistent. When FICO2 was increased, the cycle period was prolonged and the abdominal expiratory activity was enhanced. In many rats, the iliohypogastric nerve showed biphasic discharges that consisted from the pre-and post-inspiratory discharges. The preinspiratory discharge has larger amplitude and shorter duration than the post-inspiratory discharge. Since the post-inspiratory discharge was usually small or indistinguishable in the adult rat, the present results suggest that the pattern of abdominal expiratory activity will change during the postnatal development. We investigated the role of GABAergic neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVM) in central respiratory control. We used GAD67-GFP knock-in mice in which we could identify GABAergic (i.e., GFP-positive) neurons in a living condition. We recorded GABAergic neuron activities (n = 40) in medullary transverse slices. About 20% of GABAergic neurons were inspiratory, and all of the remaining neurons were non-respiratory. About 50% of GABAergic neurons recorded in the superficial RVM were CO 2 inhibitory, and all of the remaining neurons were CO 2 insensitive. We suggest that GABAergic inhibition in the RVM respiratory neuron network is mediated mainly by inspiratory neurons. GABAergic neurons are also involved in central chemosensitivity. We investigated two groups of people with a different initial level of an emotional tension before Intellectual Loading (IL). First group had the initially increased emotional level, Stressed Group (SG), and the second group had not, Calm Group (CG). Reaction time (RT) of simple visual sensorymotor reaction and asymmetry of Skin Potential Level (SPLa) in two facial zones: forehead and nasal were measured. From Research groups, subgroups with 0 and 10 mV SPLa were extracted. Thus the distinction in the greater RT gain after IL in subgroups with 10 mV forehead SPLa, in comparison to subgroups 0 mV forehead SPLa. Such law was common for both for SG and for CG. In two subgroups of 0 and 5 mV nasal zone SPLa in SG the greater RT gain after IL was in 0 mV nasal SPLa subgroup, and for CG in 5 mV subgroup. It was shown, that individual features of IL performance are related to SPL lateralization. But the low of the relationships of SPL asymmetry in nasal zones depends on the level of emotional tension of investigated groups.",

Wistar male rats were instrumented with electrodes for measurements of renal (RSNA) and lumbar (LSNA) sympathetic nerve activity and catheters for measurements of systemic arterial and central venous pressure. Rats were exposed to 90 dB white-noise for 10 min. 90 dB noise exposure resulted in an immediate and significant increase in RSNA while LSNA did not change significantly during the exposure in sham-operated (SO) rats. There was a significant difference in the response between RSNA and LSNA during the 90 dB noise exposure in SO rats. Sinoaortic denervation attenuated the magnitude of the increase in RSNA while it had no influence on the changes in LSNA observed in SO rats. These data suggest that arterial baroreceptor significantly contribute to the differential control of RSNA and LSNA during freezing behaviour in conscious rats. Here, we first demonstrated that in both the Kolliker-Fuse nucleus (KF) and the rostral ventral respiratory group (rVRG) region, phrenic nucleus (PhN)-projecting neurons were embedded in the plexus of axons originating from the ventrolateral subnucleus of the nucleus of the solitary tract (vlNST) and that the vlNST axon terminals made synaptic contacts with somata and dendrites of the PhNprojecting neurons, using a combined anterograde and retrograde tracing technique. Secondly, we indicated that some of the vlNST neurons innervate both the KF and the rVRG by way of axon collaterals, using the double-labeling method. Using retrograde tracing combined with in situ hybridization for mRNA encoding glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), we finally showed that most of the KF/rVRG-projecting vlNST neurons expressed GAD67 mRNA. These results suggest that vlNST neurons may exert inhibitory influences upon the PhN-projecting KF/rVRG neurons for inspiratory control. We have examined whether the neurons of the DMV have direct synaptic contacts on the myenteric ganglia using WGA-HRP. The myenteric ganglia of the stomach were composed of four types of neurons. The average numbers of axosomatic terminals per profile were 2.0 on the small neurons, 3.1 on the medium-sized neurons, 1.2 on the large neurons, and 4.2 on the elongated neuron. Most of the terminals contained round vesicles and formed asymmetric synaptic contacts on the small, medium-sized and large neurons. About 80% of the axosomatic terminals on the elongated neurons contained pleomorphic vesicles and formed asymmetric synaptic contacts. When WGA-HRP was injected into the DMV, many anterogradely labeled terminals were found around the myenteric neurons. The labeled terminals were large (3.16 m), and contacted exclusively the somata. Most of them contained round vesicles and formed asymmetric synaptic contacts. Serial ultrathin sections revealed that almost all neurons in a ganglion received projections from the DMV.",

To verify this hypothesis, we studied neuronal mechanisms of respiratory rhythm modulation induced by external [K + ] change. We recorded membrane potential of Pre-I neurons, C4 nerve and facial nerve activities. Addition of 4 mM K + to the standard superfusate decreased burst rate of C4 activity. Addition of 6 or 8 mM K + caused initial inhibition of C4 burst and subsequent high frequency C4 burst. The facial nerve burst was depressed. Pre-I neuron was depolarized strongly by application of high K + , and the burst activity was disturbed and action potentials were inactivated.

Whole-cell recording was applied to the postsynaptic neurons in coronal slice preparations of medulla oblongata isolated from infant rat. Bath application of SP (1 M) increased or decreased the frequency of spontaneous activities. Several neurons were clamped at \u221260 mV and recorded EPSCs evoked by electrical stimulation to dorsoventral adjacent area from recording neurons. In several neurons, evoked inward EPSCs were augmented by SP perfusion. I-V curve suggested that voltage dependent current was both augmented and not changed by SP. Our previous studies have shown that administration of neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) antagonist near the NA inhibited gastric and respiratory movement in anesthetized rat. These results indicated that SP affect to both post and presynaptic NK1R and regulate the transmittance efficiency to generate the output signal of certain autonomic reactions.",

When an ambiguous figure is presented continuously for a period of time, we experience spontaneous switching between the alternative interpretations. As this occurs without any changes in the figures themselves, perceptual switching phenomena are eminently suitable to study how perceptual processes are influenced by the intrinsic dynamics of neural activity. We analyzed eye-movement and EEG during perceptual switching in the Necker cube. Blink probability showed a peak about 800 ms before the button press responses. We found that only blinks that appeared around the peak time led to a characteristic spatiotemporal pattern of EEG. Our results indicate that some, but not all, blinks play an active role in perceptual switching processes.",

We investigated power and phase synchronization analyses of MEG signals and compared the spatiotemporal patterns during spontaneous perceptual alternation (rivalry condition) with the externally-triggered alternation (replay condition) to extract the inherent dynamics of perceptual alternation. As results, we detected transient anterior-posterior synchronizations in advance of subjects' reports of perceptual alternation in the rivalry condition.

MEG signals were measured during subjects performing a visual infrequent target detection task. Distributed source model was used to infer the dynamic neural activities at the multiple regions and the structural equation modeling (SEM) was then used to compare two possible causal models underlying the generation of major event-related components, namely P3, related to the target detection. We used Akaike information criteria (AIC) and goodness-of-fit index (GFI) as measures of the goodness of the models. The results of the comparison of two possible SEM models, whose major difference was on the contribution of the activities in the parieto-temporal region to the generation of P3 components, suggested the involvement of frontal and anterior cingulate cortex in the early P3 component (P3a) and the contribution of the parietal and temporal regions to the later component (P3b In our study, we investigate whether or not bilinguals use distinct neural substrates to recognize words in their first and second languages (L1 and L2, respectively). We compared the brain activity of 11 Chinese learners of Japanese as L2 with that of 28 Japanese natives studied in our previous study. We obtained written informed consent from each subjects. In data analysis, we used SPM2. While natives showed specifically greater activation in the left middle temporal gyrus than learners, learners showed specifically greater activation in the bilateral parieto-occipital and left occipito-temporal junction than natives. These results indicate that there are distinct neural substrates for word recognition of L1 and L2. Neural activations for lexical processes were measured using noun, vowel, and pseudo-character decision tasks with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on ten right-handed subjects, and their time courses were analyzed with an fMRI-constrained MEG-multi-dipole method. The average activations rose at latencies around 100 ms in the occipital gyrus or cuneus (OG/Cuneus) and ventral occipito-temporal areas (vOT), and at latencies around 200 ms in the posterior superior temporal and inferior parietal areas (pST/iPL), anterior temporal area (aT), and posterior inferior frontal gyrus (pIFG). The differences in activation between tasks are considered to reflect visual-form process in the OG/Cuneus and R.vOT, phonological process in the L.pST/iPL and L.pIFG, and semantic process in the L.aT. The decay of activation for these areas was found to be well fitted to exponential functions with time constants around 500 ms. The effectiveness of a habituation/dishabituation paradigm for determining the cerebral dominance for language was examined using a 1.5 T fMRI. Healthy right-handed adult volunteers with prior written informed consent were instructed to listen to analysis-synthesized words. After habituated to a single word presented repeatedly, the subject was presented with contrastive words which comprised comparison and habituation words in a pseudo-random order. The two blocks were repeated alternately for 6 times. Comparison words were phonemic or intonational derivative of the habituation word, and presented in respective sessions. The results showed that the left auditory cortex responded more to the phonemic contrast, and the right to the intonational contrast, which is in line with other paradigms/techniques for determining cerebral dominance, while the present paradigm demands little effort on the subject. The issue that whether meaning of kanji words is accessed from orthography, or from both orthography and phonology representations is still debated. The present fMRI study investigated brain areas underlying the use of orthography and/or phonology in kanji reading by engaging subjects in semantic categorization task with homophone and orthographic similarity effects. Fifteen native Japanese volunteers participated. Stimuli were pairs of definitions and their target words, including correct words and foils. The subjects were asked to decide the correct target words of definitions. The results showed that homophone versus non-homophone foils increased activation of the left fusiform and middle frontal gyri. Orthographically similar versus dissimilar foils increased activation of the left middle and inferior frontal gyri. These findings reflected the roles of both orthography and phonology in kanji reading. Moreover, homophone versus non-homophone minus orthographically similar versus dissimilar foils revealed activation of the left fusiform gyrus. This might suggest the role of this area in character-to-sound conversion of kanji words.",

Normal subjects were presented with a picture of a naturalistic situation involving two actors, in which risks related to a tool and the direction of action were modulated in a two-factorial design. After the fMRI, each subject self-evaluated the degree of risk in each picture. Main effects of object-and direction-related risks were observed in the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and dorsolateral parieto-frontal network, respectively, suggesting that the object-and direction-related risk signals are separately processed in these networks. Significant positive correlation between self-evaluated risk and cortical activation was observed in the anterior part of the left superior frontal sulcus, suggesting an involvement of this region in phenomenal risk-perception. In this fMRI study, we identified cortical areas where activation during experience of risky situation is correlated with the Harm Avoidance (HA) scores, subscale of Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). Forty-six healthy subjects performed a rule speculation task in risky, normal, and safe situations in fMRI. Each situation was arranged for subjects to gain 10, 50, 100 points or lose 100, 50, 10 points, respectively. Cortical activation induced by experience of risky situation was estimated. A significant positive correlation with the HA scores, was observed in activated areas in the right anterior insula in Risky versus Safe comparison. The results suggested that activation in this region predicts the individual difference in behavioral response to risky situation. This finding indicates that the right insula underlies individual difference in response to risky situation.",

Before fMRI, subjects encoded two kinds of four-scene comics; the complete version with four scenes and incomplete one without the last scene. After encoding, subjects performed three tasks during fMRI. In the first task, subjects chose a last scene associated with the first scene encoded in the incomplete version (Memory-based Reasoning: MR), whereas in the second task, subjects recognized a last scene encoded in the complete version (Memory: M). In the third task, subjects chose a last scene appropriate to the first scene in the new comics (Reasoning: R). Activations specific to MR was found in a relatively anterior part of the left PFC and right PFC. The common activations between MR and M were identified in the right MTL, whereas a relatively posterior part of the left PFC was activated commonly between MR and R. The findings suggest that the network including bilateral PFC and right MTL may contribute to the experience-based reasoning of future events. To assess neural responses to reciprocal mindreading in socially strained human relationships, we performed an fMRI study in 16 healthy subjects who participated in the Chicken Game. Statistical parametric mapping showed that the counterpart effect (human versus computer) activated the anterior paracingulate cortex (PCC) and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). When we analyzed the data to evaluate whether the subjects made aggressive or reconciliatory choices, the posterior STS showed that the counterpart had a reliable effect regardless of risky or safe decisions. In contrast, a significant opponent x selection interaction was revealed in the anterior PCC. It could be inferred that the posterior STS and the anterior PCC play differential roles in mentalizing; the former serves as a general mechanism for mentalizing, while the latter is exclusively involved in socially risky decisions. Creativity is the ability to generate new and original ideas. The most of studies of creativity used linguistic tasks which involve multiple aspects oflinguistic information processing in addition to creativity. We used new artistic creativity task such as designing new tools, in which we could quantitatively evaluated the creativity by the originality (OS: originality score) of the products. Using fMRI, we observed BOLD signal change during designing task in art students (trained) and non-art students (untrained). We observed clear difference between two groups; in the trained highly creative group, the OS is correlated with the interhemispheric difference of neural activities of the prefrontal cortex with right hemisphere dominance.",

Furthermore, recent studies have shown that chewing causes activation of various brain regions, including prefrontal cortex. We therefore examined the influence of chewing on brain activities using fMRI. The subjects used were 20-30 aged healthy adults, being conducted continuously to two-back task with intermittent gum-chewing. Gum without odors and taste component was used to remove effects other than chewing. The results indicated that chewing tended to increase the BOLD signals in the prefrontal area including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during two-back task.

            "text": "Segmentation of speech stream is a prerequisite for language acquisition. Language learners use the transitional probability between vocal tokens to segment continuous auditory stream into distinctive words. We consider that the ability for statistical learning is not specific to language, but more general cognitive competence. And we ask whether this ability could be considered as innate. In this study, we measured ERPs for 18 neonates within 3 days, in order to examine whether neonates can learn transitional probabilities and statistically segment words. Four three-tonal-words were presented in random order without intervals during recording of the EEG. As a result, only the first tone of each word evoked a significant positive component in the frontal area. Since this potential is not evident during the first session, this is likely to be due to statistical learning. These results suggest that the ability to distinguish words based on statistical information is innately prepared in humans. Using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), changes in concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) in the prefrontal cortex were evaluated while eleven human subjects performed the paintings appreciation task. In this task, subjects were required to appreciate abstract and representational paintings that appear one after another on a computer monitor. Subjects were then required to judge the degrees of interest, beauty, and desirability immediately after the appreciation. It was shown that the peak of averaged oxy-Hb change was higher while subjects appreciated abstract paintings. Average differentiation for each oxy-Hb change revealed that the changes while the appreciation of representational paintings were more accelerated than that while the appreciation of representational paintings. These results suggest the different cortical activity dependent on appreciation of abstract and representational paintings. We used MEG to investigate the spatiotemporal cortical activities during mental calculations and their modulation by arithmetic complexity. Eleven healthy subjects have participated in the study. Three conditions were considered: EASY: Add three (3) to a two-digits number without carry-over; DIFFICULT: Stimuli were the same as EASY, but with carry-over; NOCALC: Add zero to the two digits number. Probe stimuli were presented 1 s after the presentation of task stimuli (a pair of two-digit and one-digit number), and the subjects were required to respond by lifting the right index or middle finger. Root-mean-square values for 12 different MEG sensor groups covering entire cortical area were calculated to evaluate local signal power in each condition. Increased neural activities in the bilateral frontal/prefrontal and the parietal regions during both calculation conditions were observed in the latencies around 700-900 ms. The activities in the bilateral prefrontal and the left parietal areas in the same latencies were found to be complexity-dependent, i.e., increased activities in these regions were observed in DIFFICULT condition compared to EASY condition. We investigated an effect of auditory feedback on self-produced speech in children with and without autism by measuring the Lombard effect. Ten children with autism (9:4-14:11) and 18 agematched typically developing children (9:5-15:2) were instructed to name 50 pictures of objects aloud in Control and Masking conditions. In Masking, weighted-white noise was continuously delivered through a headset. The subjects' speech responses were recorded from a microphone. In typically developed children, the enhancement (Masking/Control) in Masking was significantly greater (duration = 1.2 \u00b1 0.2, loudness = 1.4 \u00b1 0.3) than in the children with autism (duration = 1.1 \u00b1 0.2, loudness = 1.2 \u00b1 0.3) (p < 0.001). The present findings suggest that deficits in speech audio feedback in autistic children and this could be one of the reasons for their delay in speech development. Since the mechanism underlying the effect of low power laser irradiation on the soft tissue is still unknown, we examined whether it can influence the muscle contraction as well as its fatigue in the frog (Xenopus laevis) gastrocnemius or not. Muscle tension continuously induced by a supramaximal stimulus to the sciatic nerve at 0.5/s chronologically attenuated and showed a simple fatigue curve. Direct irradiation of laser (532 nm, 180 mW) to the muscle surface (28.3 mm 2 ) significantly delayed its attenuation (p < 0.05). When the rest period was set between stimulating sessions and the laser irradiation was applied during the rest period, averaged muscle tension during stimulating period for 2 min decreased according to the session sequence. However, comparing with no or cooling application during the rest periods, such laser irradiation case significantly delayed the muscle fatigue (p < 0.05). It is suggested that laser irradiation has a potential to more activate ATP synthesis during as well as after muscle contraction.",

Previous study has shown that NEDL1 is exclusively expressed in neuronal tissues and its expression level is high in favorable neuroblastomas and undetectable in unfavorable ones. Dishevelled-1, a regulatory molecule in the Wnt signaling pathway, was identified as the physiological target of NEDL1 for uniquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. On the other hand, NEDL1 bound and ubiquitinated mutant (but not wild-type) SOD1 in a mutant SOD1 type-dependent manner, which is proportionally related with the FALS severity. In the present study, we show that NEDL1 physically bound p53, and induced apoptosis in a p53-dpendent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that NEDL1 may play a critical role in neuronal cell death occurring in FALS through interacting with mutant SOD1 and p53. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited motor neuron disease caused by the expansion of polyglutamine tract within the androgen receptor (AR). CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70interacting protein), U-box type E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been shown to interact with Hsp90 or Hsp70 and ubiquitylates unfolded proteins trapped by molecular chaperones and degrade them. We demonstrated in a neuronal cell model that transient over-expression of CHIP reduced the monomeric mutant AR more than the wild-type, suggesting that the mutant AR is more sensitive to CHIP than is the wild-type. We also demonstrated high expression of CHIP ameliorated motor impairments in the SBMA transgenic mouse model. These findings suggest that CHIP over-expression ameliorates SBMA phenotypes in mice by reducing nuclear-localized mutant AR, which probably due to enhanced mutant AR degradation. We performed an electrophysiological study demonstrating inhibition of spontaneous muscle action potentials within a co-culture of rat muscle and spinal cord by exposure to patients with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) serum, as well as purified IgG, from selected patients with GBS. Using a whole-cell recording technique, we then investigated the effects of serum and purified IgG from patients with GBS on voltage-dependent calcium currents (VDCC) in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Serum from selected patients with GBS and purified IgG from some serum of patients with GBS inhibited Ca 2+ current in both cells. These results suggest that muscle weakness in some patients with GBS might be induced by changes in P/Q-type calcium channel function within motor nerve terminals. The aim of the present study was to explore the possible role of COX-2 inhibitor, rofecoxib in pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 40 mg/kg, i.p.)induced kindling. Rofecoxib was administered orally daily 45 min before either PTZ or vehicle. Seizure severity was measured according to a prevalidated scoring scale. Biochemical estimations were performed on the 16th day of PTZ treatment. Chronic treatment with rofecoxib (2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg, p.o.) for 15 days showed significant decrease in PTZ-induced kindling score. Chronic treatment with PTZ significantly increased lipid peroxidation, nitrite levels (NO levels), and myeloperoxidase levels and decreased the reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in brain homogenate, which was reversed with rofecoxib treatment.",

Since loss of Nrf2 has been reported to increase neuronal death under increased oxidative stress, Nrf2 seems to play a role for neuroprotection. Administration of kainite, a potent agonist of an excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, to rodents produces epileptiform seizures followed by a delayed loss of pyramidal cells in the CA3 subregion of hippocampus. To unveil the functional significance of Nrf2 in the brain, we compared seizure responses between wild-type and Nrf2-null mice after systemic kainate administration. We found that Nrf2-null mice exhibited an increased susceptibility to the kainate-induced seizure, and their loss of the pyramidal cells and gene expression profiles are now under investigation.",

In the present study, the involvement of the activation of NMDA receptor on the ictogenesis of the 4-AP induced discharges in CA3 region was studied. Ten M 4-AP induced the epileptic discharges with the frequency of 0.33 \u00b1 0.04 Hz (mean \u00b1 S.E.M.; n = 3) and the amplitude of 1.23 \u00b1 0.86 mV. When AP-5, an NMDA receptor blocker, was applied to the pre-established epileptic discharges, the frequency and the amplitude of the discharges did not change significantly. On the other hand, when AP-5 was applied from the ictogenesis period of the discharges, the discharges did not appear. These results suggest that the NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity involves in the ictogenesis of 4-AP-induced epileptic discharges. Chronic exposure of cultured astrocytes to morphine is reported to induce differentiation of the cells. Using primary astrocyte cultures, we observed that under thyroid hormone (TH) deficient conditions, morphine significantly decreased cell viability. Further studies showed that the loss of cell viability was due to apoptosis of the cells. The effect is attenuated by TH supplementation to the culture medium. The observed effect of morphine appears to be mediated through the opioid receptor since the opioid antagonist, naloxone, inhibited the decline in cell viability. 7NI, a specific inhibitor of nNOS, completely blocked loss of cell viability suggesting that morphine induced intracellular NO production, leads to cell death. Studies suggested that NO acts through a cGMP independent pathway. The involvement of NO induced cGMP independent pathway in morphineinduced apoptosis during TH deficiency has been investigated. Collectively, the present study demonstrates that morphine mediated cytotoxicity of astrocyte is critically influence by the level of thyroid hormone in cultured medium.",

A quantitative understanding of the dynamics of different cell types when responding to complex, natural inputs, is an important prerequisite for understanding the cortical network. Neurons compute by transforming excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductance inputs into a spike train output. We have examined the properties of synaptic conductance inputs which are most effective in evoking spikes, by injecting broad-band excitatory and inhibitory conductance inputs, and using spike-triggered reverse correlation and Wiener-kernel estimation to calculate the average conductance input trajectory (ACIT) preceding spikes. The time course of the ACIT provides a general description of a neuron's response to dynamic conductance stimuli. Our analysis showed that the ACIT reflects both previous stimulus history and previous discharge history, and that the relative influences of these two factors depend on the cell type. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive neuromuscular disease caused by the destruction of motor neurons. Our study has investigated the effects of ALS-CSF on voltage-gated calcium P/Q-type channel (\u24231A) expression in pre synaptic terminals of rat spinal motor neurons. CSF from ALS and non-ALS (neurological patients) was injected into the 3-day-old rat pup spinal subarachnoid space at the rate of 1 l/2.5 min. The rats were sacrificed 48 h after CSF injection and spinal cord sections were processed for immunocytochemistry with P/Q-type channel \u24231A antibody and also for cytochrome oxidase labeling. ALS-CSF significantly increased P/Qtype channel expression compared to CSF from Non ALS patients. ALS-CSF significantly decreased cytochrome oxidase activity in the rat spinal motor neurons, which may be a sign of degeneration. It is probable that, toxic factors present in the ALS patients CSF might induce the expression of P/Q-type channel observed in pre synaptic terminals synapsing on the spinal motor neurons.",

To solve this, we visualized rather steady membrane potential change caused by perfusion of high potassium medium. A steep peak in optical signal was seen along stratum pyramidale. An application of TTX diminished this peak, and made the optical signal profile flat along the cell. Thus, we concluded that the specificity of the VSD is small.

Although recent studies have addressed anatomical features of pyramidal cells identified projection regions, little is known about intrinsic membrane properties of these subtypes. Here, we obtained whole cell recordings from rat frontal layer 5 pyramidal cells that project to the striatum (CCS) or pontine nucleus (CPn), identified by injection of fluorescent retrograde tracer to these regions. Firing properties of pyramidal cells had similarity depending on the projection regions. CCS cells showed strong adaptation of successive spike intervals in response to the depolarizing current injection. However, CPn cells exhibited very little spike frequency adaptation during current injection. We also examined synaptic inputs from layer 2/3 neurons to these subtypes by single cell stimulation, and detected excitatory inputs in both subtypes. Our results suggest that physiological properties of layer 5 pyramidal cells are correlated with their subcortical target. This study aimed to clarify expressional changes in types 1 and 2 of ryanodine receptors (RyR1 and RyR2) in the cerebellum of a Ca 2+ channel \u2423 1A subunit mutant, rolling mouse Nagoya. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed altered mRNA signal levels of RyR1 but not RyR2 in the RMN cerebellum: a less RyR1 mRNA signals than in the control cerebellum. Well consistent with the semi-quantitative RT-PCR results, RyR1 immunostaining in soma and primary dendrites of Purkinje cells was less intense in RMN than in control mice. In contrast, RyR2 immunostaining was detected in cerebellar glomeruli but the staining intensity was not different between RMN and controls. The present study suggests that somatodendritic RyR1 expression in Purkinje cells was decreased in the cerebellum of RMN. This may suffer RyR1-mediated Ca 2+ release, contributing altered Ca 2+ homeostasis in the RMN Purkinje cells.",

In this talk, by mathematical analyses and the NEURON simulator, we demonstrate that the balance of inward and outward currents, which can be controlled by down/up-regulation of the A-type K channel induces a divergence of the membrane input resistance, i.e. a singularity, and such super-sensitivity is the fundamental mechanism for boosting amplification of AP paired with EPSP. The balance of Na and A currents is essential for controlling dendritic integration manners. We also show that the down-regulation of the A-type K channel, which modifies the ratio between the inward and outward currents, leads to a drastic change from amplifying AP mode to shunting EPSP mode.",

Therefore, we assumed these family proteins were auxiliary subunits of AMPA receptors. To prove this hypothesis, we generated \u24254 subunit knockout (KO) mice using the Cre/loxP recombination system and analyzed their phenotypes. The \u24254 subunit KO mice were viable, fertile, and displayed no overt phenotype. On the other hand, on Western blot analysis, protein expression levels of AMPA receptor subunits were reduced in KO mice compared with those in wild-type at postnatal day 11, while the reduction was not so significant in adult brain. These results suggested that \u24254 might regulate dynamics of AMPA receptor subunits during early development. In the CNS, neural damages, such as hypoxia, ischemia and degenerating diseases, are often accompanied by disturbances in the pH environments. Ambient pH plays as a significant signal for neural functions. Microglia (brain phagocytes) express abundant voltagegated proton (Hv) channels which have extremely high selectivity for H + and potent H + efflux ability. Exposure to Na-lactate (pH 6.8) induced cell acidosis and activation of the Hv channels. The channel activation was characterized by increased conductance, facilitation of activation kinetics, prolongation of deactivation kinetics and a shift of the activation voltages to negative potentials. Consequently, the Hv channel could open more easily over a wide range of the membrane potential during lactic acidosis, and may contribute to a quick relief of the cell acidosis.",

Voltage-gated proton channel currents have classically been described in snail neurons and recently in mammalian blood cells. However, the molecular basis underlying this channel has been elusive. Here we identify a novel cDNA clone named as mouse voltage-sensor domain only protein (mVSOP1). Cells overexpressing this protein showed depolarization-induced outward currents accompanied by tail currents during repolarization, which reversed at equilibrium potentials for protons. Imaging analysis demonstrated that pHin recovers rapidly after an acid load in mVSOP1-transfected cells. mVSOP1induced currents exhibited two key features of native voltage-gated proton channels: pH-dependent gating and Zn 2+ sensitivity. Neutralization of a positive charge in the S4-like segment caused shift of the voltage-conductance relationship, suggesting that it plays important role in gating. Oscillatory extracellular electric fields have been observed in mammalian brains. The electric fields modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic events. To investigate the effect of the oscillatory electric fields on the CA1 pyramidal neuron, we applied sinusoidal electric fields to the rat hippocampal slice and recorded voltage responses with a voltage sensitive dye (RH414). Application of sinusoidal electric fields induced transmembrane voltage oscillations in all the layers of the CA1 region. In the pyramidal layer, the amplitudes of the responses to the 1-Hz field were the largest. The amplitudes were decreased monotonically when the frequency of the fields became higher. However, in the stratum radiatum, the amplitudes of the responses to the 3-10-Hz fields were larger than those to the other frequencies. The frequency preference in the dendritic region may be an underlying mechanism for the synchronization of the membrane potentials among large population of neurons within the theta frequency range. Acid sensing ion channels 2 (ASIC2) have proposed to constitute mechanoreceptors and nociceptors. We examined the localization and characterization of ASIC2-expressing cells in rat central nervous system (E17-P14) using immunohistochemical techniques. ASIC2positive fiber first appeared in brain stem and spinal cord at E17-18 stage. ASIC2-expresseing cells appeared in white matter of brain stem and spinal cord at E20 stage. In early postnatal stages ASIC2expressing cells appeared in corpus callosum, cerebellar medulla and dorsal horn of spinal cord at P4 stage. These cells were identified as an oligodendroglia by oligodendrocyte specific antibody and immunoelectron microscopy. These results are suggested the hypothesis that the function of ASIC2 mediate the myelin formation in the developmental stages of central and peripheral nervous system.",

In this study, we investigated ionic conductances underlying the long 1st ISI by whole-cell recordings in rat slices. Application of 100 M apamin, an SK-type Ca 2+ -activated K + (Kca) channel blocker, shortened the 1st ISI and decreased the amplitude of the slow AHP. The shortening of the 1st ISI was observed when membrane potentials were depolarized. Moreover, application of 3 M mibefradil, a T-type Ca 2+ channel blocker, shortened the 1st ISI. These suggest that the firing pattern of FIL neurons arises from activation of SK-type Kca channels induced by Ca 2+ influx through T-type Ca 2+ channels.",

PX (0.6 M, within 5 min) increased the frequency of spikes and shortened AHP. Slow waves of depolarization with superimposed bursts were recorded within 20 min. Atropine blocked the depolarization shift but not the other effects of PX. PX was able to reversibly decrease the duration of calcium spikes elicited in a Na + free Ringer. This effect observed in the presence of atropine and was along with a decrease in the duration of Ca 2+ spike AHP and an increase in the spike frequency. The PX blockade of Ca + channels may decrease the activation of Ca 2+ dependent K + channels that underlies AHP. Blockade of these channels possibly makes the neurons susceptible for burst induction, while activation of metabotropic muscarinic receptor by PX underlies the depolarization shift with associated bursts. Dendritic membrane properties are reported to be non-uniformly distributed in a single neuron and the non-uniformity could be important for synaptic integration. However their distribution is still unclear. We estimated distribution of membrane resistance by fitting a compartment model to voltage imaging data of membrane response in hippocampal CA1 slices to perturbation, such as propagating EPSP induced by synaptic inputs and biphasic response to extracellular electric field. By numerical simulations, we found that these imaging data were consistently reproduced if we assume a step function as distribution of membrane resistance. This implies that a steep decrease of membrane resistance exists in distal dendrite of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron.

Since they contribute to various physiological functions including neuronal pacemaking activity, setting of resting membrane potential and generation of paroxysmal discharge, we examined their expressions as well as functions in the PNS using the frog (Xenopus laevis) sciatic nerves. Western blot analyses for HCN1-4 demonstrated that samples from the nerve and the heart showed an HCN2 band whereas those from the dorsal part of skin and the gastrocnemius did not, and that immunoreactivities for HCN1, HCN3 and HCN4 could not be found in those samples. When an HCN channel blocker, ZD7288 was applied on the stimulus portion of sciatic nerve and the nerve was elicited at 0.5/s by a duration of 10 ms pulse with supramaximal intensity, the generation of anode-break-excitation rather than cathode-makeexcitation was significantly blocked (p < 0.01). It is suggested that HCN2 channels exist in the PNS and they contribute to the burst or recurrent discharges. Ifenprodil, a clinically used cerebral vasodilator, interacts with several receptors, such as \u2423 1 adrenergic, N-methyl-d-aspartate, serotonin and receptors. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the various effects of ifenprodil remain to be clarified. Here, we show that ifenprodil inhibited G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K + (GIRK; Kir3) channels, which play an important role in the inhibitory regulation of neuronal excitability in most brain regions and the heart rate, expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In contrast, Kir1.1 and Kir2.1 channels in other Kir channel subfamilies were insensitive to ifenprodil. The GIRK currents induced by -opioid receptors or ethanol were also attenuated in the presence of ifenprodil. The inhibitory effects of ifenprodil were not observed when ifenprodil was applied intracellularly. Our results suggest that inhibition of GIRK channels by ifenprodil, at submicromolar concentrations or more, may contribute to some of its therapeutic effects and adverse side effects.",

An increase in [Na + ] i was revealed by an image processor in C6 cells loaded with a Na + indicator (SBFI), under high [Na + ] o conditions. [Na + ] i elevation was augmented by ouabain or by bumetanide (Na + /K + /Cl \u2212 cotransporter blocker), while it was decreased when Na C expression was inhibited by RNAi techniques. The real-time PCR method revealed that the expression level of the immediate early gene egr-1, which is involved in cell growth, was concomitantly reduced. It is to be noted that similar alterations in cell growth, egr-1 level and [Na + ] i were induced by a Na + ionophore (monensin) without raising [Na + ] o . These data indicate that Na + enters through Na C upon [Na + ] o increase, and [Na + ] i elevation itself is responsible for these phenomena.",

However, little is known about how distribution of Na + channels contributes to the activity and function of single neurons. In avian nucleus laminaris (NL), neurons act as coincidence detectors for sound source localization, and are tuned to both characteristic frequency (CF) and interaural time difference (ITD) of sounds. We show here in the chick that NL neurons have distinct distribution of Na + channels along the axon and optimize the ITD sensitivity depending on their CF. Neurons of high and middle CF (higher than 1 kHz) had small action potentials, and had no Na + currents in the somatic membrane, but clustered only in the axon at some distance from the soma (20-50 m). While, neurons of low CF generated large overshooting spikes, and Na + channels were clustered closer to the soma (5 m) in the axon. Thus, NL neurons had a spike generator on the axon, at a greater distance from the soma with the increase of CF. By computer simulation, these unique distributions of Na + channels were found essential to enhance the coincidence detection.",

Here we report the effect of BPA on GABA A receptors using a conventional whole-cell patch clamp technique from acutely isolated rat CA3 pyramidal neurons. BPA itself elicited a postsynaptic current, which is highly sensitive to bicuculline, in a dose-dependent manner. BPA increased postsynaptic currents induced by GABA at lower concentrations (<10 M), but decreased those induced by GABA at higher concentrations (>100 M). In addition, BPA decreased both the current amplitude and decay time constant of GABAergic mIPSCs. Finally, mechanisms underlying BPA-induced modulation of GABA A receptors will be discussed. We recently generated Nav1.1-deficient mice and showed that these mutant mice developed epileptic seizures and died prematurely. We have now used these Nav1.1-deficient mice as negative controls to examine Nav1.1 distribution in the mouse brain using RNA in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. At low magnification, Nav1.1 expression was higher in the thalamus, superior colliculus, inferior colliculus, pons, medulla and cerebellar nuclei relative to other brain regions. Contrary to previous studies indicating a somato-dendritic Nav1.1 distribution, in the present study, higher magnification analysis revealed that Nav1.1 is predominantly distributed to axons in some brain parts. This apparent discrepancy may reflect the lack of specificity of anti-Nav1.1 antibodies used in these previous studies, none of which utilized Nav1.1-deficient mice. Based on our findings, we propose that Nav1.1 might be involved in propagating action potential to presynapses.",

Because the environment changes over time, the firing rate varies for each interspike interval. We used a novel method of information geometry to estimate the spiking irregularity whatever the functional form of the firing rate is. Our estimator is simple and easily applicable to experimental data. The estimator is useful for characterizing spiking irregularity which varies among neuron types.

The microdialysis analysis showed that the amount of Gln in the dialysate was increased by three times in the colchicine group compared with the control group.

In several types of neurons, including pyramidal cells in the hippocampus and granule cells in the cerebellum, the zfh-5 antisense RNA is expressed prior to the mRNA; as the level of the antisense RNA gradually decreases, zfh-5 mRNA starts to be expressed.

To directly trace the lineages of these OPCs, we employed double transgenic mice that express tamoxifen-sensitive CreER under the control of the Olig2 promoter together with ROSA-EGFP reporter. The GFP positive cells were detected around the injured region, and the almost all of these cells co-expressed GFAP at late phase after injury. Furthermore, we confirmed that the morphological characteristics of these cells were those of the astrocyte by immunoelectron microscopy. Our results clarified that dormant OPCs in vivo differentiate into astrocytes in adult injured brain, and suggested that these cells participate in glia scar formation after brain injury. Olig2 is a bHLH transcription factor, essential for oligodendrocytes (OLs) and motoneurons differentiation in the spinal cord. However, differentiation of Olig2 lineage cells in the forebrain is largely unknown. Here we examined fates of Olig2 expressing cells in the fetal forebrain by tamoxifen (TM)-inducible Cre-loxP system. Olig2-CreER knockin mice were mated with reporter mice, and TM was injected at embryonic day (E) 12.5 or 14.5, when most of Olig2+ cells are observed in the basal forebrain. The Olig2+ cells at E12.5 gave rise to more neuron than glia that included both OLs and astrocytes. Majority of neuronal Olig2 lineage cells differentiated into GABAergic neurons, and a lesser number, into cholinergic neurons. The Olig2+ cells at E14.5 generated more glial cells than neurons. These results indicate that Olig2 lineage cells generate three major types of neural cells with a stage dependent manner, and may have multiple functional roles on neural differentiation in the fetal forebrain.",

In mammals, neuronal Hu expresses in both early postmitotic and mature neurons and has ability to induce neuronal differentiation by binding to the UTRs of specific target mRNAs. To understand the molecular mechanism of Hu induced neuronal differentiation, we purified HuB associated complexes. Among them, NF90 family, a double strand RNA binding protein which is one of Hu associated proteins, is known to bind to UTRs of p21, p27 and tau mRNA known as Hu targets. We generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies against NF90 and NF45, binding partner of NF90, respectively. In mouse embryonic brains, we found that NF45/90 expressed highly in postmitotic neurons where neuronal Hu proteins are highly distributed. Moreover, we found that Hu and NF45/90 formed mRNP complexes in mouse brain extracts. We will discuss the role of Hu binding partners in neuronal differentiation through post-transcriptional regulation.",

However, little is known about how species-specific pallial structures are generated during embryogenesis. To address this issue, we compared several neuronal subtypes and their migration patterns in the developing pallium of the mouse and quail. Cell tracing analysis revealed that neurons born at the dorsal pallium tangentially migrated in the developing quail telencephalon, as in the mammalian cortex. Next we investigated distribution of later-born neurons in the quail telencephalon using laminar specific genes (er81 and Brn2) in the cerebral cortex. In situ hybridization and immunohisitochemical studies indicated that these neuronal markers were expressed in discrete regions of the developing quail telencephalon. Our data suggest that early stages of cortex/pallium development are comparable between the mammalian and avian embryos, whereas neuronal specification in later stages is regulated by distinct mechanisms in each species.",

The anti-nestin immunoreactivity was progressively declined, whereas number of cells expressing anti-\u2424III tubulin immunoreactivity increased through the re-cultivation for 1-4 weeks.

In the adult cortex, NG2 is known as a marker for oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) that retain ability to proliferate and differentiate into new oligodendrocytes. However, it is still unclear whether all NG2 + cells in the neocortex are the OPCs. We investigated about subtypes of NG2 + cells found in the perineuronal regions of the cerebral cortex using cell markers. Two subtypes of perineuronal NG2 + cells could be distinguished by the subcellular localization of GST-protein. One is nuclear type, the other is cytoplasmic type.

Stimulation at sSC induced negative field potential with short latency and short duration (100-200 ms) at the recording site in sSC adjacent to the stimulating site. After application of bath containing 10 M bicuculline, the same stimulus induced a large negative field response with long duration (200-400 ms) that spreads laterally in sSC and ventrally to dSC. These responses disappeared after application of 50 M APV, when only short latency response remained.

To test this possibility, we examined effects of MD on the amount of phosphorylated (activated) ERK (pERK) in the rat visual cortex. By MD, we found a significant decrease in the amount of pERK in V1 receiving deprived eye inputs in both young and adult rats.

To clarify mechanisms underlying the two forms of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in different direction, we examined other characteristics of them, (1) how rapidly the reverse OD shift proceeds and (2) whether the shift is induced only in young animals. We infused the cortex with muscimol in 4-week-old kittens and in adults. The reverse OD shift was observed after 6 days MD, but not significant after 3 days MD. In adults, OD distribution remained unchanged. Morphological change of individual input axons was also examined after 6 days MD.

Brief monocular deprivation (1d MD) rapidly alters both the phosphorylation state and surface expression of GluR1 in visual cortex. Here, we addressed whether these coincidental events are essential for subsequent ocular dominance (OD) plasticity. Mice lacking GluR1 (KO) displayed little LTD in visual cortical slices, while baseline transmission was normal. They also exhibited normal visual receptive field properties in vivo and shifted responsiveness toward the open eye after 4d MD during a typical critical period. The rate of plasticity appeared somewhat slowed, as 20d MD eventually led to full OD shifts. In GluR2 KO mice, even 4d MD robustly activated OD plasticity.

Proportion of SOM cells in GABAergic cells was smaller in the primary visual area (5.3%) than in other areas, such as the prefrontal (10.8%), primary motor (9.8%), somatosensory (10.0%) and secondary visual areas (8.5%), indicating cortical differentiation in GABAergic system of the primate cerebrum. Our recent retrograde labeling studies in mice and cats showed that the neocortical areas are connected not only by excitatory neurons but also by GABAergic projection neurons. In order to address the importance of the GABAergic projection neurons in the neocortical information processing, we need to know the branching pattern and postsynaptic elements of the GABAergic projection axons. Since more than 80% of the GABAergic projection neurons showed NPY immunoreactivity, we used NPY-Cre transgenic mouse that express Cre in NPY neurons and adenovirus that encodes GFP in the downstream of floxed stop to label the GABEergic projection axons. After injection of the adenovirus into deep layers of the NPY-Cre mouse neocortex and immunoperoxidase staining of GFP in the brain section, we could reveal GABAergic neurons in a Golgi-like image with their axons. Also this method seemed to allow us to label GABAergic projection neurons retrogradely.",

Basal dendrites of cells in visual association cortex such as inferior temporal area TE spread more extensively and are more branched than those in the primary visual cortex (V1). Pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex, such as area 12, have even more dendritic branches than those in area TE. Here, we investigated whether a similar regional difference in the dendritic morphology was present in infant monkeys. We stained individual layer III pyramidal cells in V1 (n = 52), area TE (n = 46), and area 12 (n = 43) of a 3-week old monkey (Macaca fascicularis) using intracellular dye-injection techniques in lightly fixed tissues. The number of branches and the tangential extent of dendrites was greatest in area 12, followed by area TE, and V1.

We performed the patch-clamp recording and fura-2 based calcium imaging in cat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Under whole cell clamp conditions, transient sodium currents and action potentials were observed in all of normal or axonal regenerated RGCs. However, these currents and spikes were not observed in the 50% of axotomized RGCs. Bath application of 100 M carbachol, an ACh receptor agonist, rose [Ca 2+ ] i in 22% of normal RGCs. Although the 85% of RGCs responded to carbachol at 3 days after axotomy, no responsive RGCs appeared during 7-15 days. ACh responsiveness recovered in axonal regenerated RGCs (17%). Since pycnotic cells were observed few days after axotomy, ACh may modulate neurotrophic effect in survived RGCs. These results suggest that ACh is an important marker for neuronal degeneration and regeneration in cat RGCs.",

The Gaussian envelope moved at 30 deg/s, while the texture consisting of black and white random-noise pixel blocks remained stationary (drift-balanced stimulus).

Motion consisted of successive steps (100 Hz), each one-fourth of the wavelength of the beat, so that with each step the two components shifted one-fourth of their wavelengths and had opposite directions, the 5f forwards and the 3f backwards. The contrast of the 5f was fixed at 4, 8, or 16%, while the contrast of the 3f was varied from one-fourth to four times the contrast of the 5f. When the contrast of the 3f (5f) was less than about half that of the 5f (3f), the 5f (3f) dominated initial OFR: winner-take-all.

From the above points of view, we investigated independence of visual estimation and motor execution for grasping position of a target object. In this experiment, grasping positions were measured under the following four conditions: visual estimation without grasping, grasping without lift-up movement, grasping and lift-up movement and visual estimation without grasping. As a result, we found that grasping positions of visual estimation are significantly different from grasping positions of motor execution in the second and third conditions (p < 0.05).

Recently, Wallace et al. found that multimodal neurons clustered in deep layers are present near the borders between sensory cortices. Multimodal properties of these neurons may be explained by three types of inputs: overlapped projections from the thalamus, projections from multi-modal sites, or overlapped horizontal projections from the modality-specific sensory cortices. In this study, we tested the third possibility. We prepared the mouse cortical slices including the visual and auditory cortices. The horizontal activity propagation elicited by local electrical stimulation were visualized using flavoprotein fluorescence imaging. These results indicate that cortical areas between the visual and auditory cortices receive horizontal projections originated in the visual and auditory cortices, suggesting that multimodal horizontal connections are important for the multimodal properties of sensory neurons.",

Here, we addressed to what extent these two types of plasticity induced by the same MD share common mechanisms. Adult mice lacking a GABA-synthetic enzyme (GAD65 KO), which do not exhibit ocular dominance (OD) plasticity by brief MD during the critical period, showed normal optomotor acuity and enhancement with 4 day MD. OD shifts did not correlate with optomotor enhancement in these mice. Finally, early MD spanning the entire critical period had no effect on optomotor acuity through the deprived-eye.

To identify the neuronal populations responsible for multisensory enhancement in rats, we have mapped the activation of neurons during an audiovisual integration paradigm (Sakata, et al., 2004) by the expression of c-Fos. A pronounced c-Fos upregulation was found in superior colliculus and in layer IV and deep layer of latero-medial secondary visual area (V2LM). Local injection of GABA agonist muscimol into this region selectively suppressed the behavioral enhancement related to multisensory integration, while no suppression was found by the injection into primary auditory and visual areas.

We studied this double rivalry process based on psychophysical and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measurements. Pattern-motion percept exclusively arose and persisted for a long duration whereas component-motion percept was soon followed by percept of either of left or right eye's single motion direction. Reaction time (RT) measurement showed that the pattern-motion was perceived faster than left or right eye's motion direction. We then compared MEG signals among those perceptual conditions and found a MEG response of interocular rivalry in the latency range expected from the result of RT measurement.

For example, a ball moving in a diagonal trajectory can appear to rise in a frontal plane when the shadow moves along the horizontal trajectory (rising configuration) or to roll in depth when the shadow follows the same trajectory as the ball, while the trajectory of ball is identical. Using fMRI, we found that several visual areas, including human MT and the posterior STS and the posterior parietal cortex, are activated in the comparison between rising configuration and ball only condition. Additional correlation analysis by modifying the slope of the shadow' s trajectory also showed activation in the posterior part of STS and the posterior parietal cortex, including precuneus. These results suggest that cortical areas in the temporal and parietal cortex might be involved in the processing of apparent motion of ball induced by the moving cast shadow.",

In previous in vivo studies, the laser irradiation could focally inactivate neural activities in a few minutes after the irradiation started, while the activities recovered in a few minutes after its cessation. By using this technique, the present study examined corticocotical relationships in the auditory cortex of the Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). CF (constant frequency) and FM (frequency modulated) tones were presented to anesthetized animals, and neural responses were extracellularly recorded contralaterally to the ear of stimulation. When irradiated AAF area and recorded neural responses from AI, the irradiation changed phasic responses into tonic responses, and vice versa. These results indicate that there are functional connections within AI or AAF, and between AI and AAF.",

Moreover, AAF has dense synaptic connections within the area (Budinger et al., 2000) . We made network models based on this structure of AAF and could gain similar responses to the actual responses of directiondependent neurons.

The present study investigated the topographical representation of auditory space in the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx) of anesthetized gerbils. The ICx is the major auditory nucleus that has projections to the SC. The stimuli were 50-ms noise bursts whose azimuths varied on the horizontal plane in the virtual acoustic space. Single-unit responses were recorded from the ICx. The majority of units exhibited some degree of spatial selectivity and preference for the azimuth contralateral to the recorded side. For supra-threshold stimulus only, there were topographical gradients of preferred azimuths in the ICx. However, the spatial tuning width and preferred azimuth of the units depended markedly on stimulus level. The results indicate that in mammals, the formation of a rigorous auditory space map is incomplete at the ICx level.",

Immunohistochemical analysis of the rat brain showed that NB-2 was detected not only in all brain regions of the auditory pathway, but also in substantia nigra (SN), caudate putamen (CPu) and fibers projecting from SN to CPu. The NB-2 immunopositive cells in SN are restricted to GABAergic neurons.

Glutathione (GSH) protects against the hearing loss through scavenging ROS generated by noise. In this study, we investigated the changes in expression of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) gene, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo GSH synthesis, in the cochlea following acoustic stimulation. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the cochlea at various time points after acoustic stimulation (4 kHz octave band, 125 dB, 5 h), and then subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay to determine activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding. AP-1 binding was increased 2-12 h after the exposure. RT-PCR and immunostaining revealed that noise exposure was effective in elevating the expression of GCS in the cochlea 2 h later. Taken together, AP-1 may participate in the expression of GCS gene in the cochlea after acoustic stimulation.",

Small injections of biocytin into the TRN, which were made with guidance of electrophysiological recording of auditory response, resulted in retrograde labeling.

To sing complex sequences, they require auditory feedback during singing. Song nucleus NIf has a projection from primary auditory area Field L and then it projects to sensory/motor nucleus HVC. Moreover, bilateral lesion of NIf cause song deterioration on complex sequences (Hosino and Okanoya, 2000) . We recorded auditory responses by multiunit activity from NIf and Field L. Auditory responses of NIf showed selectivity to Bird's own song (BOS) than its reversed song (REV). Comparing selectivity of NIf and Field L, NIf showed stronger selectivity than Field L. However, NIf did not show sequence dependent selectivity. These results suggest that NIf relays auditory information and enhances BOS selectivity. However, we did not observe a direct evidence that NIf related to generation of complex sequences. We started to record responses extracellularly from AC neurons of guinea pigs. In general, animals show a stereotyped pattern of behaviors; they have a quiet, almost-motionless period, usually for tens of min. During this period, animals do not appear to sleep but be sensitive to the environmental disturbance. Thereafter they usually fall asleep with their eyes closed. During this presleeping period, the best frequency tone was repeatedly presented 100-500 times at a fixed interval, through a speaker at 50-70 dB SPL. Responses to such repetitive tones are apparently irregular, with the occurrence of spikes in most trials but no spikes in some trials. However, if all the trials are accumulated, there was global phase alternation every a few to tens of seconds. One phase constitutes relatively high rates of spike occurrence, while the other very low rates of spike occurrence. We suppose that, unlike a machine, the brain has a unique mechanism that automatically turns on and off the cortical processing of the redundant sensory stimulus.",

The subjects were required to vocalize a and to hold the pitch of a feedback voice constant. In TAF condition, the pitch was altered suddenly two or three times, whereas in non-TAF condition the pitch was not modulated. Under the TAF condition, auditory feedback control is selectively expected to work more strongly than the non-TAF condition. Thus, a comparison between these conditions could neatly extract brain regions involved in auditory feedback control of pitch. As a result, right supramarginal gyrus, right frontal lobe (BA9), right anterior insula, left premotor area and right superior temporal gyrus showed greater activation (12 subjects, p < 0.05 corrected).

An FM sound evoked a strong onset response spreading widely over the cortex, which was followed by a later response moving across the iso-frequency contours in the core fields. The location of the later response was corresponding roughly to the instantaneous frequency input of each FM sweep. On the other hand, a pure tone evoked a wide-spreading onset response followed by strong and long-lasting inhibitory effects. The later response to an FM sound appeared clearly when the frequency of the FM sweep was modulated over a wider range of frequencies, while it was diminished when the sound frequency was less modulated.

If the flavoprotein fluorescence is photobleached, energy metabolisms and neural activities can be inactivated. We applied this photo-inactivation technique to demonstrate auditory signal transmission from the anterior auditory field (AAF) to the primary auditory cortex (AI). Cortical responses in AAF and AI after sound stimuli (5-20 kHz) were visualized using transcranial flavoprotein fluorescence imaging in mice anesthetized with urethane. After determination of tonotopic maps, the auditory cortex was irradiated with strong blue light derived from a xenon lamp for 40 min, while the surface either AAF or AI was covered with a piece of carbon paper for preventing photo-inactivation. Although photoinactivation of AI had almost no effect on the responses in AAF, photo-inactivation of AAF significantly reduced the responses in AI. These results suggest the presence of auditory signal transmission from AAF to AI.",

In vivo intracellular recording from owl's NL cells revealed that sound waveforms are observed in the postsynaptic membrane potentials (Sound Analogue Potential; SAP). We simulated synaptic inputs to the owl's NL neurons by recruiting the convergence of phase-locked excitatory inputs. Several parameters such as the degree of phase-locking, the number of convergence and the time course of a unitary synaptic input affected the amplitude of SAP, the amplitude of DC depolarization and the spectral features of synaptic noise in a complex manner. Biophysical mechanisms for recreating sound waveforms by synaptic potentials will be discussed.",

The subjects responded correctly when the great or fifth toe was touched (cf. Fein, 1987) . Surprisingly, subjects tended to misidentify the second toe as the third (47.2%), and the third toe as the fourth (37.2%), while the reverse misidentification rarely occurred (third as second, 4.5%; fourth as third, 7.1%). This unidirectionality suggests that misidentification arises not only from large overlapping receptive fields associated with the toes, but from some additional factors such as a lack of experience with visuotactile integration, which could be used to reshape the toe receptive fields.",

In this study, we examined whether saccades affect temporal order judgments of tactile stimuli. Right-handed subjects were required to make a visually guided rightward saccade (24 \u2022 ), and to judge the order of successive tactile stimuli that were delivered one to each hand at various timing relative to the onset of the saccade. With a stimulation interval of 100 ms, subjects generally judged the order correctly as long as the stimuli were delivered after the saccade. However, they often misreported (i.e., inverted) the order when the stimuli were delivered just prior to the onset of the saccade (within 300 ms). The results show that the reversal effect of saccades is multimodal and further suggest that multimodal brain areas are involved in ordering sensory events in time.",

In the caudal part of the SpVi, about a half of neurons were mono-whisker-responsive neurons, which are thought as local circuit neurons. Almost all neurons had angular tunings to upward deflection of whiskers in the rostral part of the SpVi, while neurons in the caudal part of the SpVi exhibited various angular tunings to all directions.

In this study, we examined the specific involvement of the lemniscal pathway to the discriminative perception of whisker stimulus direction. Rats were trained to perform a single-whisker directional discrimination task, and the task performance was evaluated before and after the selective electrolytic lesion or muscimol inactivation of each trigeminal and thalamic nucleus.

To examine electrical properties of the array, single motor unit action potentials evoked by the electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve of a rat were recorded in the left tibialis anterior muscle. Signal-to-noise ratio of observed signals decreased with probe impedance, suggesting that lower impedance is better for recording small action potentials. However, lower impedance makes more difficult to record local signals, because signals observed at probes with low impedance were highly correlated (r = 0.91). To record local signals, it is necessary to decrease the area of the recording site of each probe at the expense of an increase in the impedance.",

Concomitant with this observation, Western blot analysis showed that the NMDA receptor subunit NR1 expression significantly decreased in the hippocampus of the hyperthyroid rats, compared to that of normal and the hypothyroid rats.",

In the present study, we examined GFP expression could be used a marker for the SDN-POA.

Both area and number of GFP expressed cells in the SDN-POA were larger in male than in female, however, female GFP cells in the SDN-POA showed concentrated distribution than male. These results suggest that GFP labeled cells in SDN-POA could be useful marker to make clear the function of the SDN-POA. Recent studies on gonadal steroids imply that testosterone and estradiol are involved in learning and memory with modification of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus. Although previous in vivo studies have demonstrated that these steroids increase the number of dendritic spines in neurons, it is still unclear whether each steroid has a direct effect on the modulation of the spatio-temporal patterns of dendritic morphogenesis. In the present study, we investigated steroid-induced morphological changes using cultured hippocampal neurons derived from neonatal or embryonic mice. The neurons were transfected with Venus-actin. Time-lapse images were taken by laser scanning confocal microscope during steroid treatment. Testosterone but not estradiol increased the number of spines/filopodia of the dendrites within 4 h. These results obtained from in vitro studies suggested that testosterone affects dendritic morphogenesis of hippocampal neurons in short term.",

In regulation of GnRH neurons, GABA may be one of the major players, especially in relation to GnRH/LH surge. We, therefore, performed a cell-physiological analysis of GABA action on rat GnRH neurons. Cells were dispersed from adult GnRH-EGFP transgenic rats and cultured overnight. GnRH neurons, were applied to the perforated patch-clamp configuration with gramicidin D. GABA evoked Cl \u2212 conductance, which was almost completely blocked by either picrotoxin or biccuculin. The reversal potential of the response was ranged from \u221240 to -10 mV in identified GnRH neurons in both sexes. There was no difference in the reversal potential among the stages of estrous cycle. In unidentified neurons, however, the reversal potential was more negative than -50 mV and most of them were \u223c\u221280 mV. In conclusion, GnRH neurons isolated from adult rats express GABAA receptor and its reversal potential is more positive than the resting potential. Although the neural activation in the subfornical organ (SFO) by angiotensin II (ANGII) is widely regarded for the increments of ANGII-induced water intake and vasopressin release, galanin (GAL) have been reported to inhibit them. Therefore, GAL may inhibit neural activity of ANGII-sensitive SFO neurons. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated existences of all mRNAs of GAL receptor subtypes, GalR1, GalR2 and GalR3, in the SFO. In extracellular recording on SFO slice preparation, GAL dose-dependently led to inhibition of neural activity. All GAL sensitive neurons showed excitatory response by ANGII. GalR1 selective agonist M617 induced inhibitory responses, as well as GAL. In patch-clamp recordings, GAL induced outward current in some neurons. These results suggest that GAL inhibits neural activity in SFO neurons through, at least partially, outward current following activation of GalR1.",

Enzymes required for the synthesis of estradiol from cholesterol were expressed form PD1 to PD14 with a higher level than in the adulthood.

Recently, we found that hippocampal neurons synthesize E2 (Hojo et al., 2004) , and express estrogen receptor \u2423 (ER\u2423) at synapses. Endocrine disrupters are representative estrogenic industrial compounds. While their disrupting effects on reproductive organs are well documented, their effects in the central nervous system are almost unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of E2 and endocrine disrupters (DES, BPA, NP, OP and TBT) on NMDA-induced LTD in the rat hippocampal CA1, CA3 and DG with a custom made multi-electrode measuring system (MED64). LTD was enhanced by E2 dose-dependently in CA1, CA3 and DG. DES, BPA, NP, OP and TBT had similar or different effects on LTD dose-dependently. Our results suggest that estradiol and endocrine disrupters rapidly modulate synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and that the action of endocrine disrupters can be quantitatively analyzed by measuring the modulation of LTD of the hippocampal neurons. We examined the effects of chronic salt loading on the hypothalamic expressions of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OXT) genes and body fluid balance in AVP-enhanced (e) GFP transgenic rats. Chronic salt loading caused marked increase of the eGFP fluorescence in the hypothalamoneurohypophyseal system in transgenic rats. There were no differences of the AVP and OXT gene expressions in the hypothalamus, plasma AVP and OXT levels and water balance between nontransgenic and transgenic rats under normal condition and after salt loading. Humoral responses to chronic salt loading were maintained in AVP-eGFP transgenic rats.",

Low concentration of salusin-\u2424 stimulates the secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP) from perifused rat hypophysis. Salusin-\u2424 coexists with AVP, but not oxytocin, in the rat magnocellular supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN). To further investigate the physiological role of salusin-\u2424 in body fluid homeostasis, we examined the effects of salt loding for 5 days on salusin-\u2424-like immunoreactivity (LI) in the SON and PVN of rats by immunohistochemistry. The marked increase of salusin-\u2424-LI in the SON and PVN were observed in the salt loaded rats.

Here, we examined the presence of such an afferent pathway in medaka Oryzias latipes. Injections of a DiI crystal into the cluster of GnRH neurons resulted in labeled cells in the midbrain tegmentum, and injections to the midbrain tegmentum resulted in labeled terminals close to the GnRH neurons.

The medial preoptic area (mPOA) is an important neural site for regulation and maintenance of sleep. Studies have indicated that GABAergic neurons and terminals at the mPOA are active during sleep. Present study was carried out to elucidate the contribution of GABA-A receptor at the mPOA in sleep-wakefulness (SW) in male Wistar rats. The SW was assessed by chronically implanted electrodes for EEG, EOG, and EMG. A bilateral guide cannula was also implanted for drug injection into the mPOA. After recovery, three baseline sleep recordings were taken for 4 h on different days. Bicuculline methoiodide (GABA-A receptor antagonist) at a dose of 30, 60, 90 and 120 ng in 200 nl was injected bilaterally into the mPOA in different groups of rats and their SW was studied for subsequent 4 h. The 30 ng dose of bicuculline methoiodide had minimum effect whereas 60 and 90 ng produced arousal. Maximal wakefulness was observed at dose of 90 ng with no further increase in wakefulness at higher dose of 120 ng. The results suggest the involvement of GABA-A receptors at the mPOA in SW.",

Constant light exerts a promoting effect on hepatic carcinogenesis. After the partial hepatectomy, hepatic cell proliferation is regulated by circadian rhythm information (via Wee1). To know the relation of proliferating factor (cell cycle) with circadian rhythmicity, locomotor activity against a diethylnitrosamine (DEN), widely used to initiate the hepatic neoplastic foci, is analyzed in preliminary. DEN was injected (i.p., 200 mg/kg) on rats during the free-running condition under the constant dim light (DD) and constant light (LL). The effects of DEN were gentle under the DD. However, under the LL, phase delay accompanying the elongation of circadian period () was observed. Decrement of an amount of activity in 24 h after the DEN administration was obvious under the LL compared with that under the DD. This study was designed to investigate the central regulating system of hypothermia during maintenance phase of hibernation. Although intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of naloxone (non-selective opioid receptor antagonist) and naloxonazine, (1 antagonist) were effective, naltrindole (\u2426 antagonist) and nor-BNI ( antagonist) did not interrupt the hibernation. The increment of c-Fos expression was observed in arcuate nucleus (ARC) at 1 h after from hibernation onset compared with before hibernation. In addition, a localized \u2424-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (\u2424-End IR) was observed in neuronal perikarya in ARC at 1 h after from hibernation onset. Although \u2424-End IR in ARC got weak, the \u2424-End IR of nerve fibers in preoptic nucleus (PON) got strong with progression of hibernation. These results suggest that the \u2424-endorphin was transported to PON from ARC by axonal flow and then played an important role in maintenance of hypothermia via 1-opioid receptors in hibernation.",

PGDS has two distinct types, the lipocalin-type PGDS (L-PGDS) and hematopoietic PGDS (H-PGDS). Selenium compounds have been reported to decrease sleep by inhibiting PGDS in rats. To clarify what type of PGDS inhibition is involved in sleep reduction by selenium or whether selenium intoxication decreases sleep, we intraperitoneally injected SeCl 4 into L-PGDS and H-PGDS knockout (KO), and their wild-type (WT) mice. In WT mice, SeCl 4 decreased rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep for 5 h after injection and, concomitantly, increased wakefulness. Similar results were observed in H-PGDS KO mice. In contrast, L-PGDS KO mice did not exhibit any significant changes in sleep-wake profiles after SeCl 4 administrations. These findings indicate that PGD 2 plays an essential role in the maintenance of the sleep state under physiological conditions, and L-PGDS is a key enzyme for the production of PGD 2 involved in sleep-wake regulation. Under baseline conditions, H 1 R KO mice showed essentially identical sleep-wakefulness cycles to those of wild-type (WT) mice but with fewer incidents of brief awakening (<16 s epoch), prolonged duration of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep episodes, a decrease in the number of state transitions between NREM sleep and wakefulness, and a shorter latency for initiating NREM sleep after an intraperitoneal injection of saline. The H 1 R antagonist pyrilamine mimicked these effects in WT mice. These results indicate that H 1 R is involved in the regulation of behavioral state transitions from NREM sleep to wakefulness (Huang et al., 2006) .",

Since cytosolic Ca 2+ regulates diverse cellular systems, we have hypothesized that the cytosolic Ca 2+ rhythms may mediate the cellular output from the clock gene oscillations. Here, to address the clock gene functions on the Ca 2+ rhythms, mouse Bmal1 and its dominant negative sequence (mBMF1R5) are transfected into the organotypic culture of SCN with a yellow cameleon Ca 2+ sensor by the gene gun.

In the present study, the effect of epinephrine on the generation of carbachol-induced \u2424 oscillation in CA3 region of rat hippocampal slices. Carbachol (30 M) induced \u2424 oscillation with the frequency and the amplitude of 14.8 \u00b1 0.1 Hz, and 0.7 \u00b1 0.1 mV, respectively (mean \u00b1 S.E.M.; n = 3).

Clonidine (50 M), an \u24232 receptor agonist, alone significantly increased the frequency at the concentration of 50 M (*p < 0.05). Yohimbine, an \u24232 receptor antagonist, suppressed the oscillation.

Peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) of ensemble as well as individual neuronal activity in response to the single-site stimuli applied far from the recording site composed of transient (latency 100-300 ms), oscillatory (2-4 Hz) and sustained responses.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the crosscorrelation between the EEG power changes (EEGPC) of each band and the cortical hemoglobin concentration changes (HbCC) during sleep. We measured optical topography (OT) and EEG simultaneously. The HbCC was measured at eighty-eight positions covering whole head of subject by OT probes. Five females and eight males participated in this measurement. The results showed the high correlation between EEGPC and HbCC at the location of dorsolateral prefrontal area, both in the period of (i) dominance of alpha-wave and (ii) dominance of sleep spindle. The time lag from EEGPC to HbCC was from 1 to 8 s in (i), and from 8 to 15 s in (ii). We examine these differences between (i) and (ii) in detail.

We show herein that nocturnal locomotor activity (LA) was reduced under FC and recovered to normal by carnitine injection in Jvs \u2212/\u2212 mice, a model of systemic carnitine deficiency. As judged from EEG/EMG profiles, Jvs +/+ mice showed prolonged wakefulness under FC, but Jvs \u2212/\u2212 mice revealed disruption of the prolonged wakefulness with a high frequency of non-REM sleep. As the orexinergic arousal system plays an important role in LA, we determined orexin neuronal activity in the fasted mice. Fasted Jvs \u2212/\u2212 mice had fewer c-Fos + orexin neurons in their lateral hypothalamus and a reduced orexin-A content in their CSF, suggesting that the fasted Jvs \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited reduced LA and fragmented of wakefulness due to suppressed orexin neuronal activity.",

Thus, we examined effects of orexin on PPT neurons electrophysiologically using brain slice preparations in rats. Applications of orexin depolarized the membrane potential of PPT neurons dose-dependently, and the depolarization was associated with the increase in membrane resistance. When extracellular K + concentration was increased, the magnitude of the depolarization significantly decreased. When extracellular Na + was replaced by N-methyl-dglucamine, the magnitude of the depolarization also decreased significantly.

This is possibly due to changes in the biological activity of the TNFalpha system. Besides their important function in sleep regulation during acute immune response, cytokines also seem to be involved in physiological sleep regulation. Orexins (hypocretins) are recently identified neuropeptides that are derived from a common precursor peptide. Recent studies suggest that specific degeneration of orexincontaining neurons occurs in brains of human narcolepsy patients, suggesting critical roles of these neurons in the regulation of vigilance states.

These effects might also possibly be involved in the pathophysiology of narcolepsy.",

In this study, the effects of BPA on general motor activity and avoidance response to predator odor and olfactory responses in medial amygdala neurons were examined. The smell of fox predominantly suppressed locomotor activity and enhanced avoidance response by BPA. In the electrophysiological study, male medial amygdala neurons showed selective excitatory responses to predator odors. This type of neurons did not respond to plant odors. In contrast female amygdala neurons did not show such selectivity. The sex difference in this neuronal response pattern was attenuated by BPA exposure. These findings suggest that BPA impairs sexual differentiation of medial amygdala neurons which affect emotional responses to the olfactory cues of predators.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to 1-BP on sexual differentiation of reproductive and non-reproductive behaviors. Pregnant rats were exposed to 700 ppm of 1-BP during prenatal period. The open-field test, Lashley III maze test and sexual behavior were evaluated at adult age. 1-BP significantly reduced the locomotor activity and the number of entries into the center area in female rats but not in males in the open-field test. In sexual behavior, the number of ear wiggles, an index of proceptive behavior, was decreased and the rejection score was increased in female rats. These results suggest that 1-BP is the potential candidate of endocrine disruptors which affect brain development.

But the neurotoxcitiy induced by prenatal exposure has not been well investigated. In this study pregnant rats were exposed to 1-BP (700 ppm) during gestational day 1-20 (6 h/day), and the hippocampal excitability in pregnant rats and their offspring was examined. Basic excitability was enhanced and disinhibition was observed in the hippocampus of pregnant rats. Offspring, however, exhibited an enhancement of averaged S/R curve of PS in the CA1 at the PND 12-15. Conversely, S/R curves of fEPSP as well as PS in the CA1 were inhibited at the age of 6-8 weeks. Our results suggest that 1-BP causes hyperexcitability in pregnant rats, and disrupts basic excitability in the CA1 of the offspring during development.",

Our previous study demonstrated that the autistic model exhibited abnormality of 5-HT system and behavioral impairments related to autism. In the present experiment, we gave a prolonged FST for 60 min in the model rat, which frequently experienced to be drowned after the immobility time during FST. Brain DA and 5-HT levels were measured from samples collected from the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We found a gradual and steady increase in PFC DA level during FST, although 5-HT level showed only transient augmentation.

Developmental Res., Kasugai, Aichi, Japan Neuroligin (NL1-4) is a family of neuronal cell-surface proteins to be involved in intercellular junctional formation and signalling. Recently, several studies have implicated NL3 and NL4 in autistic disorders. NLs have a relative identical structure (\u223c70%); NL1 and NL2 localize in the glutamatergic excitatory, and inhibitory synapses, respectively, while NL3 seems express in the olfactory glia, but NL4 distribution is unknown. Here we have generated antibody against human NL4, and explored its distribution in the post mortem human tissues. In the central and peripheral nervous system, NL4 was expressed exclusively in the neurons, and was especially abundant in particular subsets of neurons, including neurons producing nonapeptides. NL4 was observed in paraneurons and some endocrine cells outside the CNS. These results suggested that NL4 is important for neuroendocrine function. NL4 cDNA was transfected to in neuroblastoma. Formed spine-like structures on the cells expressing NL4 were rough and thicker than those of NL1 or NL3 transformants. It suggested the unique activity of NL4 for synapse formation. Motopsin is a serine protease secreted from pyramidal neurons of cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Recently, the truncation of motopsin gene has been reported to cause non-syndromic mental retardation. However, the underlying mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. We report here that the knockout (KO) mice deficient in the expression of motopsin exhibit morphological abnormality. Golgi-Cox staining revealed that spine density on both apical and basal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in the KO mice significantly decreased than in the wild type mice. Similarly, spine density tended to decrease at cingulate cortex of the KO mice than wild type. Our results suggest that motopsin affects dendritic spine formation and/or stabilization. Mental retardation is a frequent disorder affecting 1-3% of the population. Recently the truncation of motopsin/neurotrypsin gene has been identified in Algerian family in which four out of eight children affected by a severe impairment of cognitive functions with an IQ below 50. Here we report that knockout (KO) mice lacking motopsin gene mildly impaired water maze performance and social behavior. The KO mice significantly delayed the latency to the platform area on a probe test of hidden version of Morris water maze although they showed the similar performance to wild-type mice during training session. In a social memory test, the KO mice showed significant elongation of sniffing time to an intruder, despite of normal performance of social memory. Our results suggest that the KO mice provide insights into the molecular mechanisms important for development of cognitive functions.",

This has been used as an index of impulsive behavior and is known to be susceptible to lesions of brain structures such as the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the nucleus accumbens (NA). It has been shown that the BLA and NA are involved in maintaining reward seeking behavior with a secondary reward when a secondary reinforcer is available. Thus, a question arises as to how the behavioral response on the delayed lever is maintained through functions exerted by these structures when no secondary reinforcer is available. To this end, we implanted cannulae bilaterally and electrodes into the BLA and NA to identify neuronal substances and activities involved in the mediation of 'putative secondary reward' without secondary reinforcer.",

NR1 and NR2 (A-D) subunits harbor the glycine and glutamate binding sites, respectively. NMDARs are localized in both synaptic and extra-synaptic areas, but they are found at higher density within the synapse. After the peak of synaptogenesis, the NR1/NR2A complex, characterized by rapid offset kinetics, dominates at the synapse, while the NR1/NR2B complex, characterized by slow kinetics, predominates in the extra-synaptic area. The activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs by glutamate escaping from the synaptic cleft during episodes of high synaptic activity suggests that they may have a different role. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons from mice (at 12 weeks of age), we found that following induction of ischemia, ifenprodil, a selective NMDAR-NR2B antagonist, reduced the inward current of the isolated NMDAR at extra-synaptic site while it had less effect at the synaptic NMDAR. The molecular mechanisms involved are currently under investigation and these new data will be also presented at the meeting. In the present study, we observed expression and changes of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 region after ischemia. In blood, corticosterone levels increased biphasically at 30 min and 12 h after ischemia, and thereafter its levels decreased. In the sham group, MR and GR immunoreactivities were weakly detected in the CA1 region. By 3 days after ischemia, MR and GR were not significantly altered in the CA1 region. From 4 days after ischemia, MR and GR immunoreactivities were detected in astrocytes and microglia in the CA1 region, and at 7 days after ischemia. The specific distribution of corticosteroid receptors in glia may be associated with the differences of MR and GR functions against ischemic damage. The present study was investigated the effects of early treadmill training after cerebral infarction in rats. We determined whether treadmill exercise changes cellular expression of caspase-3 and midkine in the MCA area. Stroke was induced by a 90-min MCA occlusion using an intraluminal filament. Rats were exercised for 20 min each every day on a treadmill. Brain damage in ischemic rats was evaluated by infarct volume. Exercised and non-exercised rat brains were processed for immunocytochemistry to quantify the areas of caspase-and MKimmunoreactive calls. No significant differences in infarct volume were found between rats trained with treadmill and non-exercised controls. Cellular expressions of MK were significantly increased in striatum (glia) of the exercised rats. Treadmill exercise was shown to suppress the decrease in caspase-3 expression in the penumbra. The present study showed the exercise after cerebral infarction might have important implication for post-ischemic recovery.",

The present study aims to characterize the Ca 2+ paradoxinduced cell injury in neuron/astrocyte co-cultures. Prior exposure of the cultures to a low Ca 2+ solution for 60 min significantly injured only neurons after reperfusion with a normal Ca 2+ medium for 24 h, but astrocytes remained intact. After the onset of reperfusion, the intracellular concentration of Na + in astrocytes increased significantly during the reperfusion episode, resulting in a reversal of the operation of the astrocytic GLT-1. The present findings suggested that Ca 2+ paradox-induced accumulation of Na + in astrocytes was involved in the reperfusion-induced excitotoxic neuronal injury resulting from the reversed operation of astrocytic GLT-1 during the reperfusion episode.

Exons of the Notch3 were amplified by PCR and subsequently analysed for DHPLC and direct sequence. The first patient carried the missense mutation C577T, which results in pro167ser. The second patient carried the missense mutation C302G, which results in arg75pro.

In group-reared mice, an anxiolytic diazepam increased the number of steps climbed to the top step of the staircase, but did not affect the frequency of rearing behavior. The anxiogenic drug \u2424-CCA increased the number of rearing, but did not affect the number of steps climbed. On the other hand, methamphetamine increased the number of steps climbed to the second step.

There are significant differences between the muscimol-and baclofen-treated groups in the avoidance rate, implying that GABA A and GABA B receptors have the opposite action on the performance of avoidance learning. Perfusion with muscimol through the microdialysis probe decreased the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HIAA) concentration in the CA1 area, whereas baclofen perfusion had no effect, suggesting that the GABAergic system may exert to inhibit the serotonin release in the CA1 area through GABA A receptors.",

The previous study suggests that EP1 modulates DA system. To investigate the roles of EP1 in DA system, we examined EP1KO mice with behavioral sensitization induced by cocaine. The administration of cocaine elevated DA concentration in the nucleus accumbens up to \u223c300% in both wild-type and EP1KO mice. However, increase of locomotor activity in EP1KO mice was significantly lower than that in wild-type mice. Because locomotor activity is closely related to dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) signaling, we tested the density of D1R and D1R signaling with phosphorylation of DARPP-32. There were no differences in D1R binding. D1R signaling was significantly attenuated in the striatal slices from EP1KO mice. The effect of D1R agonist on locomotor activity was also attenuated in EP1KO mice. These results indicate that PGE 2 has enhancing effects on locomotor activity via EP1 by potentiating the D1R signaling. Central serotonin (5-HT) function has been implicated in impulsivity. The present study examined rats with 5-HT depletion by parachloroamphetamine (PCA) in simple and reversal go/no-go visual discrimination tasks, and analyzed the relationships between learning performance and focal concentrations of 5-HT and its metabolites (5-HIAA) in the brain. For both tasks, significant negative correlations between learning performance and 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations were observed in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. In contrast, for reversal task only, significant correlations between learning performance and 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations were observed in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala. These data suggest the regional difference of 5-HT roles on selective indices of impulsivity.",

However, in a considerable number of transplant recipients, cyclosporine causes neuropsychological side effects such as confusion, depression, and anxiety. Cyclosporine inhibits calcineurin activity and forebrain-specific calcineurin knockout mice exhibit deficits in social behaviour. It is thus possible that cyclosporine causes psychological side effects via disturbing social interactions. Here, we examined effects of cyclosporine upon anxiety and social behaviour in mice. Calcineurin did not significantly change percent entries into open arms and time spent on open arms in the elevated plus maze test. On the other hand, in the social interaction test in home cage, cyclosporine increased the number of particles in home cage, an index of social activity. All these data suggest that impaired social interaction is a cause of psychological side effects of cyclosporine. To investigate the distribution of functionally activated vestibularrelated brainstem neurons during postnatal development, ombined immuno-/hybridization histochemistry of c-fos expression was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats (P1-21; adult). Conscious animals were subjected to rotational or translational stimulus which activates hair cells of the horizontal semicircular canals or utricle, respectively. Neuronal activation within brainstem nuclei was defined by the expression of c-fos. Labyrinthectomized controls and normal stationary controls showed only a few sporadically scattered Fos-expressing neurons. With rotational stimulation that comprised cycles of constant angular acceleration and deceleration, Fos-labeled neurons were observed by P4 in the vestibular nucleus and downstream relay stations of vestibular pathways, such as the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus and inferior olive (subnuclei DMCC, IOA, IOC, IOK). A later maturation time was evidenced for the utricular system. Fos-labeled neurons were only identifiable in the vestibular nucleus by P7; in the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus and inferior olive (subnuclei DMCC and IO\u2424) by P11. Within the vestibular nucleus of P7-9 rats, neurons activated by canal or utricular inputs were intermingled throughout its rostro-caudal length. In P21 and adult rats, neurons activated by canal or utricular inputs were intermingled in localized regions of the medial and spinal vestibular nuclei. However, neurons in the rostral half of spinal vestibular nucleus were activated only by utricular inputs. Taken together, we have demonstrated that canal-and otolithrelated brainstem neurons that encode rotational and translational movements in the horizontal plane are histologically segregated and exhibit different developmental time frame. To determine whether perineuronal nets (PN) within the vestibular nuclei contribute to plasticity of central connectivity, we studied the presentation of PN within the vestibular nuclei during development (rats, P1 to adult) and after unilateral labyrinthectomy (UL) in the adult. Histochemistry with the lectin Wisteria floribunda agglutinin was used to map PN about NeuN-immunopositive neurons within the vestibular nuclei. In normal postnatal rats, PN was detectable by P3 in the vestibular nucleus as fuzziness about neuronal cell bodies. From P9 onwards, the fuzzy PN progressively consolidated into a network organization. The fuzziness was no longer observable after P12. During postnatal development, the number of neurons showing PN increased with age, reaching the adult level by P21. With UL, the PN network on the lesioned side remained compact until 5 days post-lesion when the fuzziness reminiscent of that in early postnatal rats became evident. By 11 days after UL, the PN of some neurons resumed the network pattern as was observed in normal adult rats. This phenomenon was found in the PN of the remaining neurons by 14 days after UL. The PN on the labyrinth-intact side showed the compact network of uninjured age-matched rats. Taken together, our findings indicate PN changes that suggest possible correlation with vestibular nuclear neuronal function both during postnatal development of normal rats as well as in adult rats following destruction of the ipsilateral inner ear.",

Recordings were made from pyramidal cells and astrocytes in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices, 100 Hz/20 pulse tetanic stimulations were delivered to Schaffer-collaterals, and the evoked currents during the course of tetanic stimulation were isolated. The decay time course of the last isolated STC during the tetanic stimulation was not significantly different from that of the first. While the amplitude of the AMPAR-mediated EPSCs showed significant decay in the presence of cyclothiazide, there was no marked decay of the amplitude of the NMDAR-mediated EPSCs.

As we further depolarized the terminal EPSCs became eventually depressed concomitantly with a marked reduction in the a.p. amplitude. When presynaptic Ca 2+ currents (I pCa ), induced by an a.p.-waveform command pulse, were used to evoke EPSCs, a weak sustained depolarization enhanced I pCa and EPSCs in parallel. This EPSC facilitation was robust at the calyx of Held both in rats and mice, but was almost absent in P/Q-type Ca 2+ channel knockout mice.

Arts & Sci., Iwate Medical Univ., Morioka, Japan Application of dopamine (DA) induces a slow Na + -current response in the identified neurons of Aplysia ganglia under voltage clamp. This type of response is produced by the activation of trimeric G-protein sensitive to cholera toxin (CTX) as previously reported. The Na +current response to DA was gradually and irreversibly depressed after intracellular injection of Clostridium difficile toxin B, which is known to inactivate all types of Rho family G-proteins. Intracellular application of Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3, a specific toxin to RhoA-C, also depressed the DA-induced response irreversibly. Furthermore, the DA-induced current response was significantly depressed by GAP domain of p50RhoGAP applied intracellulary. In contrast, GEF domain of RhoGEF Dbs had a tendency to increase the response. These results suggest that the DA-induced Na + -current response may be regulated by the activation of Rho family G-protein. The \u24262 glutamate receptor (\u24262R) plays a crucial role in cerebellar functions. Although \u24262R has a putative channel pore domain, and \u24262R displayed Ca 2+ -permeable channel activities in lurcher mutant mice, it has been unclear whether wild-type \u24262R functions as a channel. Here we introduced a \u24262R transgene, which had a mutation (Gln618Arg) in the putative channel pore conserved in Ca 2+ -permeable glutamate receptors, into \u24262 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Surprisingly, a mutant \u24262R transgene, as well as a wild-type transgene, rescued all abnormal phenotypes of \u24262 \u2212/\u2212 mice, such as ataxia and loss of long-term depression. These results indicate that Ca 2+ influx through \u24262R is not required for its function in the cerebellum in vivo, and that wild-type \u24262R may not function as a Ca 2+ -permeable ion channel.",

We examined the expression pattern of AMPA and NMDA receptors in RG and CG synapses using SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labeling (SDS-FRL). The SDS-FRL revealed that synaptic size of individual RG synapses was significantly smaller than that of CG synapses. RG synapses expressed 1.7 to 3 times higher density of AMPA receptors than CG synapses. On the other hand, CG synapses expressed 1.6 to 3 times more NMDA receptors than RG synapses.

An mGluR1 antagonist, but not an mGluR5 antagonist, partially blocked the sDEPO. In addition, CGP55845 enlarged the amplitude of fast IPSCs, but not of EPSCs, that were evoked during the repetitive stimulation, suggesting an involvement of presynaptic GABA B receptors in GABA release. These results indicate that synaptically released GABA and glutamate can evoke GABA B receptor-and mGluR1-mediated responses in the GP. Contribution of these responses to the control of GP activity will be discussed.",

However, it still remains unclear how the GABA response is converted from inhibitory to excitatory in the process of afterdischarge induction. Here we traced the time-course of amplitude and reversal potential of GABAergic transmission in pyramidal cells and interneurons entraining the afterdischarge, and examined influence of glutamate on the conversion of GABA response. The GABA reversal potential in pyramidal cells rose to spike-threshold levels for >20 s after the induction. GABA Amediated Cl-influx lasted for 1.5 s, and then glutamate enhanced the conversion effectively in a GABA A -independent manner, which was dependent on an extracellular K increase. Coapplication of GABA and glutamate caused a similar oscillatory activity. The results show GABA and glutamate may cooperatively induce as well as maintain seizure-like activity.",

In the present study, we found that this synaptic strengthening was partially mediated by presynaptic GABA A receptor activation during the developmental period (P < 30), using electrophysiological methods and optical imaging. In immature animals (P10), fiber volley amplitudes were activity-dependently increased during short-train stimulation of mossy fibers. This fiber volley facilitation was significantly decreased by either inhibition of GABA A receptors or suppression of GABA release from interneurons. These results suggest that GABA released from inhibitory interneurons and GABA A receptors on mossy fibers contribute to activity-dependent facilitation of the excitatory synaptic transmission during development.",

During the early postnatal period, the inhibitory synaptic inputs to LSO neurons from medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) change from predominantly GABAergic to glycinergic. We focused on metabotropic GABA B receptor (GABA B R) as the key molecule of difference between GABA and glycine. In immature LSO neurons postsynaptic GABA B R could activate K + channels, but this effect ceased by the third postnatal week. Baclofen, a GABA B R agonist, reduced IPSC amplitude at MNTB-LSO synapses in neonate (<P5) with a significant change in the paired-pulse ratio. The presynaptic effect of baclofen was gradually decreased with development (P2-18). In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry experiment revealed GABA B R expression in MNTB neurons was also gradually decreased. The property of MNTB-LSO synapses in GABA B R knock out mouse remained immature at P14-16 compared with control mouse. Thus, GABA B receptor seems to play an important role in development of synaptic property. Pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 area receive GABAergic input from interneurons, which make synapses on the soma, dendrites and the axon initial segment (AIS). Here, we used the SDSdigested freeze-fracture replica labeling method to visualize the cell surface distribution of the \u24231, \u24232, and \u24242/3 subunits quantitatively on distinct subcellular compartments of pyramidal cells. Labelings for these subunits were accumulated over clusters of intramembrane particles (IMP) on the protoplasmic face (P-face) of the plasma membrane, indicating that many IMP clusters of a certain size represent GABAergic synapses. The synaptic labelling densities for GABA-A receptor subunits were not significantly different on the tested subcellular compartments.

Although functional defects of the mutant channel were relatively mild, we found that synaptic transmission in parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses was considerably impaired. We demonstrated that this impairment was mainly attributable to postsynaptic changes, which included reduction of the number of AMPA receptors in PSD, whereas the presynaptic function remained normal.

The second negative component (N2) became apparent in layers II/III and V. Then the activities spread downward to layer VI and developed as N3 component in a medial-to-lateral direction. We confirmed that functional thalamocingular activities were preserved in our newly developed brain slice preparation.

MSRs were constant in amplitude at 1/15 s, and were depressed completely by CNQX. When stimulus rate was increased to 1/s, MSR amplitudes were greatly reduced initially, and recovered later. This recovery of MSR was eliminated by APV. Non-NMDA component of MSRs was eliminated completely at 1/s, but appeared in constant amplitudes in the presence of cyclothiazide. From these results, Non-NMDA glutamate receptor mediated almost most of MSRs at 1/15 s, but not at 1/s due to desensitization.

Although the details of ITD processing are well investigated, not much is known about ILD. In the barn owl, it is proposed that ILD is calculated in LLDp (posterior part of the dorsal lateral lemniscal nucleus). We confirmed already that in vivo LLDp calculates ILD in the chicken as well. In this work using the patch clamp recording with the brainstem slice preparation, we found that LLDp neurons fire tonically under the regulation of two K + channels activated at low and high voltage, and receive both excitatory and inhibitory inputs representing the contralateral and the ipsilateral sound intensity, respectively. We are intending to clarify the cellular mechanism of ILD calculation as the interaction of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. To understand the functional organization of the CNS, it is essential to know how sensory information is processed within the CNS. We have been approaching this topic by following the ontogenetic patterning of neural circuit formation related to the cranial and spinal sensory inputs using optical imaging. In this study, we surveyed developmental organization of neural networks related to the olfactory nerve in the embryonic chick forebrain. Stimulation applied to the olfactory nerve elicited EPSP-related optical signals in the olfactory bulb from the 7-day old embryonic stage. The EPSP was mediated by glutamate, and NMDA-and non-NMDA-receptor components were identified. In more developed stages, in addition to the responses in the olfactory bulb, another response area was discriminated within the cerebrum, which seemed to correspond to the higher-ordered nucleus of the olfactory pathway. The results suggest that the olfactory pathway is functionally generated at early stages of development when neural networks related to other visceral and general somatic sensory inputs are also in the process of developing.",

It is known that odor stimuli elicit oscillatory events in the olfactory bulb in various species. We found that oscillatory activity was also generated in the chick olfactory bulb during embryogenesis. At early stages of development (E7-E8), postsynaptic responserelated optical signals evoked by olfactory nerve stimulation exhibited a simple monophasic waveform that lasted a few seconds. As development proceeded, the pattern of the optical signal became complicated, and oscillatory activity was observed in a later phase of the postsynaptic response. The oscillation was restricted to the olfactory bulb, and this spatial pattern was different from that of the propagating wave activity termed the depolarization wave. We examined spatio-temporal patterns of the oscillatory activity in different stages, and studied its developmental dynamics.",

Activation of D1 receptors that couple to Golf/PKA signaling leads to DARPP-32 phosphorylation at Thr34. We investigated the effect of SKF83959 on DARPP-32 phosphorylation at Thr34 by using mouse neostriatal slices. Treatment of neostriatal slices with SKF83959 increased Thr34 phosphorylation. The effect of SKF83959 was enhanced by a PLC inhibitor, U73122. In contrast, the effect of SKF83959 was partially blocked by a D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390, and the SCH23390-insensitive increase in Thr34 phosphorylation was completely abolished by an adenosine A 2A receptor antagonist, ZM241385. Thus, analysis of DARPP-32 phosphorylation revealed that SKF83959 activates at least three signaling cascades in the neostriatum: (1) PLC, (2) D1 receptor/Golf/PKA, (3) adenosine A 2A receptors.",

Cortical and hippocampal slices of the C57BL6 mouse were dyed with a voltage-sensitive dye RH414. In cortical slices, electrical single-pulse stimulation to the layer V evoked transient depolarization in the vicinity of stimulated site, and then this excitatory response propagated to the layers II-III and widely expanded in these layers. The excitation propagation in the layers II-III was significantly inhibited by thiamylal (200 mol/l). In hippocampal slices, excitation propagation elicited by the same stimulation to the CA1 stratum radiatum remained without significant changes in the presence of thiamylal at the same dose.

Eng., Osaka, Japan Activation of Akt-mediated signaling pathways is crucial for injured neurons to survive and regenerate. In this study, we attempted to identify novel substrates for Akt by using an antibody, which recognized phosphorylated consensus motif by Akt. Using PC12 cells, which overexpressed constitutively active Akt, we screened protein spots that exhibited increased immunostaining by the antibody, and consequently identified the neuronal intermediate filament protein, peripherin. Using some mutant forms of the recombinant proteins, the phosphorylation site was determined in vitro. We then generated an antibody against phosphorylated peripherin, and demonstrated that peripherin was phosphorylated not only in Akt-activated cultured cells but also in nerve-injured hypoglossal motor neurons. These results suggest that peripherin is a novel substrate for Akt in vivo and that its phosphorylation may play a role in motor nerve regeneration. The truncated TrkB receptor, T1, is involved in the control of cell morphology via the regulation of Rho proteins via Rho GDI1. However, it is unclear whether T1 regulates the downstream of Rho signaling and the actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we investigated this question using C6 rat glioma cells, which express T1 endogenously. Rho GDI1 was dissociated from T1 in a BDNF-dependent manner, which also causes decreases in the activities of Rho-signaling molecules such as RhoA, ROCK, PAK and ERK. Moreover, BDNF resulted in the disappearance of stress fibers in the cells treated with LPA, an activator of RhoA, and in morphological changes in cells. Furthermore, a competitive assay with CFP fusion proteins of T1-specific sequences reduced the effects of BDNF. These results suggest that T1 regulates the Rho signaling pathways and the actin cytoskeleton. ",

The present study was undertaken to identify target genes of JAK/STAT pathway in response to TNF-alpha & IGF-1 in neuronal origin cells. We also looked at the mechanism of activation of these target genes. We saw that JAK/STAT pathway was involved in upregulation of CyclinD1 in response to IGF-1 both at protein & RNA levels but no change was observed in c-Myc, Bcl2 levels. Interestingly, MAPK-erk, which is also known to activate CD1 in other systems, had no effect on the CD1 level in neuronal cells. On the other hand, PI3Kinase not only activated JAK/STAT pathway but also affected on CyclinD1 level. Thus it appears that JAK/STAT is activated by PI3K, which in turn upregulates CyclinD1 level. PI3K also activated erk without changing CD1 level, thus we show that JAK/STAT pathway is important for survival of neurons, activated by PI3K.

By immunoblot analysis, we found that the immunoreactive bands for DGK\u2424, -\u2425 and -were detected in the light membrane/microsome enriched fraction of rat brains, suggesting that these isozymes localize to the internal membrane system. Immunohistochemical examination on rat brain revealed that DGK\u2424 was detected as dot-like structure in the cell membrane, and DGK\u2425 as round-shaped structure in the juxtanuclear region of neurons. DGK was detected in the perinuclear region and in the dendrites of Purkinje cells. These data show that DGK isozymes localize differentially to the internal membrane system in neurons, suggesting that DGK isozymes play unique roles in distinct internal membrane system.",

Haloperidol induced catalepsy in the control mice, but such response was significantly reduced in Fyn-deficient mice. Fyn activation and enhanced tyrosine-phosphorylation of the NMDA-R NR2B subunit were induced after haloperidol injection to the control mice, but both responses were significantly reduced in Fyn-deficient mice. Both NR2B phosphorylation and the NMDA-induced calcium responses increased after dopamine D 2 -R blockade in cultured striatal neurons of the control, but not in Fyn-deficient neurons. Accordingly, D 2 -R antagonist activates striatal Fyn and the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B alters striatal neuronal activity, thereby inducing catalepsy. We also report further proteomics analysis on this molecular pathway.",

Since, there is an important another factor, an environmental factor, for the schizophrenia. Although little attention has been paid to the importance of both factors for the schizophrenia in the nervous system. Therefore, to investigate the mechanism of the onset of the schizophrenia, firstly we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening, using the N-terminal region of DYS-BINDIN as a bait. As a result, we detected several transcriptional factors. Thus, we further examine that these interactions regulate the expression level of particular genes in the neurons.",

In fact, our previous studies have shown that two neuron models with almost identical membrane potential profiles sometimes have quite different phase responses and synchronization properties. Here, we study the phase responses of the Izhikevich model showing fast rhythmic bursting and demonstrate that it exhibits synchronization properties similar to those shown by complex conductance based models. Furthermore, its synchronization properties are consistent with those of realistic models in other firing patterns.

In order to uncover the biological function of this kinase, we first examined its subcellular distribution and found that tagged CLICK-III was concentrated at the tips of filopodia-like processes in cultured hippocampal neurons, in close vicinity of actin cytoskeleton. Phenotypic studies in PC-12 cells expressing various mutants of CaMKK and CLICK-III revealed that depolarization-induced activation of CaMKK-CLICK-III signaling is sufficient to robustly induce neuritogenesis. Interestingly, CLICK-III localization in membrane fractions was regulated via sequential lipidification in an activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, lipidification mutants of CLICK-III were impaired in their ability to facilitate activity-dependent neuritogenesis. Our results thus indicate a novel role of CLICK-III in activity-dependent neurite formation and extension.",

The mRNA expression of NPLP was detected on the cell bodies of neurons meanwhile mRNA of PMP22 resided on the cell bodies of Schwann cells.

This molecule formed a self-assembled monolayer on a glass coverslip, which was used for cell-culture surface. For the neurite outgrowth, PC12 cell was recruited as a model of neuron. By irradiating UV light at small spots on the cell-culture surface, single cells were specifically attached to the corresponding spots with intermediated ECM. To draw narrow paths for neurite outgrowth, new regions were irradiated in adjacent to the cell bodies attached on the spots. NGF stimulated each PC12 cell to extend a neurite along the narrow path: the elongation required both photo-activated path and NGF. The successive irradiation in front of developing neurite achieved bending or branching of the neurite. These results indicate that the timing and direction of neurite outgrowth can be controlled with this functional culture system.",

When PC12 cells were infected with retrovirus expressing LPA 3 and treated with nerve growth factor under serum-free conditions for 3 days, neurite formation was observed in 55% of total infected cells, which was similar to that in control virus-infected PC12 cells. However, the mean length of neurites was increased in PC12 cells expressing LPA3, compared with that in control PC12 cells. Interestingly, multiple neurite sprouts were frequently observed in LPA-treated LPA 3 -expressing cells.

Each glomerulus is formed by specific synaptic connections between olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and projection neurons (PNs). In an attempt to address the question of how these glomeruli are stereotypically organized during development, we identified Wnt5 as a regulatory factor for glomerular patterning. In the Wnt5 mutant, several glomeruli were shifted to ectopic positions, and this phenotype was partially rescued by Wnt5 expression in ORNs. Previous studies in embryos have shown that Wnt5 repels the axons expressing Derailed (Drl). In the ALs of drl mutants, however, some glomeruli were located at incorrect positions, with the pattern different from that in the Wnt5 mutant. This and other genetic data suggest that Drl is an antagonist for Wnt5 signaling.

Sch. Biost., Kyoto Univ., Kyoto, Japan Plexins are cell surface receptors for semaphorins and regulate cell migration in many cell types. We have recently reported that the semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) receptor, Plexin-B1 functions as a GAP for R-Ras, a member of Ras family GTPases implicated in regulation of integrin activity and cell migration. Here we characterized the role of R-Ras downstream of Sema4D/Plexin-B1 in cell migration. Activation of Plexin-B1 by Sema4D suppressed the ECM-dependent R-Ras activation, R-Ras-mediated PI3-K activation, and \u24241 integrin activation through its R-Ras GAP domain, leading to inhibition of cell migration. In addition, inactivation of R-Ras by overexpression of the R-Ras-specific GAP or knockdown of R-Ras by RNA interference was sufficient for suppressing \u24241 integrin activation and cell migration in response to the ECM stimulation. Thus, we conclude that R-Ras activity is critical for ECM-mediated \u24241 integrin activation and cell migration, and that inactivation of R-Ras by Sema4D/Plexin-B1-mediated R-Ras GAP activity control cell migration by modulating the activity of \u24241 integrins.",

The molecular features and synaptic localization of the clustered Pcdhs have raised the possibility that they are synaptic recognition molecules. We have demonstrated that overexpressed Pcdh\u2423 family proteins alone in several cell lines are rarely transported into the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we found that a stretch of about fifty amino acids located at the C-terminus of Pcdh\u2423s interfered the trafficking to the cell surface. In the present study, we compared the transport properties of a series of the cytoplasmic region truncation mutants and found that truncation mutants lacking 34 or more C-terminal residues were detectable at the cellular surface suggesting a role for lysine-rich motif in the C-terminus of Pcdh\u2423s in the intracellular retention. MDGA1 is a novel cell surface glycoprotein similar to Ig-containing cell adhesion molecules (IgCAMs) with functions in migration and process outgrowth. MDGA1 is expressed by layer 2/3 neurons throughout the neocortex at P7 mice, but is absent in adults. Between E15.5 and late P0, stages that span the generation and radial migration of layer 2/3 neurons, MDGA is expressed in patterns consistent with its expression by migrating layer 2/3 neurons, suggesting a role for MDGA1 in controlling their migration and settling in the superficial cortical plate. We performed loss-of-function studies using RNA interference (RNAi) with in utero electroporation into the lateral ventricle at E15.5 to transfect progenitors of superficial layer neurons. We found that an RNAi suppressing MDGA1 protein blocks proper migration of superficial layer neurons to the superficial cortical layer. We conclude that MDGA1 acts cell autonomously to control the migration of superficial layer cortical neurons. In various pathological conditions, activated microglia mediate immune responses to injured CNS neurons. However, it is not clear whether and how activated microglia affect neurons via direct contacts. This study aimed at examining whether direct contacts between microglia and hippocampal neurons increase following CNS injury and whether telencephalin (TLCN), a dendrite specific adhesion molecule, which potentially binds to immune cells, mediates the direct contact. Hippocampal neurons were damaged by local injection of excitotoxin, kainic acid (KA). Compared to control animals, KA-injected mice showed higher density of contacts between activated microglia and dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Contacts with longer interface appeared in KA-injected mice. These results suggest the importance of direct contacts for the immune response of microglia to injured neurons. Similar contact formation was also observed in TLCN-deficient mice, indicating that the direct contacts are mediated by other molecules than TLCN. Kilon is belonging to immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules and contains three IgG-like domains. Western analysis revealed that the expression levels of Kilon is low at early neuronal culture and increased with progress of culture days. Immunocytochemical observation showed that Kilon was localized at elongating axon and growth cones but not at dendrites on 7 days in vitro (DIV), while Kilon was observed at synapses, mainly at presynaptic terminals on 14 DIV. Similar tendency was observed in Kilon immunohistochemistry of brain sections in vivo. Kilon was observed at axonal fibers of the cerebral cortex on postnatal day 2, but it was seen at synapses in adult brains. These results suggest that Kilon is axonal cell adhesion molecule to control axonal guidance and/or extension.",

Both mice were viable and fertile. They did not show obvious abnormalities in gross brain anatomy. To examine their behavioral phenotype precisely, the NGC-knockdown mice were subjected to several kinds of behavioral tests sequentially.

However, the mechanisms of GDNFinduced analgesia remain almost unclear. GDNF binds to GFR\u2423-1, which forms receptor complex and signals intracellularly through RET. Recently, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) has been found to be an alternative signal-transducing receptor for GDNF. Here, we report that NCAM is involved in GDNF-induced analgesia in a rat model of the neuropathic pain. NCAM mRNA expression was decreased in the ipsilateral dorsal horn of the spinal cord after the nerve injury, but GDNF treatment returned its expression to the normal level. Treatment with NCAM antisense oligodeoxynucleotide blocked the analgesic effect of GDNF without affecting RET phosphorylation.

In this study, we examined the involvement of protein kinase A (PKA) in the desensitization of the BK response. When BK (1 nM) was applied twice with a 6-min interval to the cells expressing B2R, the second [Ca 2+ ] i increase by BK was markedly attenuated. However, the pretreatment with a specific inhibitor of PKA, H-89 (1 M) restored the second response. To further confirm cAMP increase by BK, the expression of a cAMP responsive reporter gene was examined. BK (10 pM) treatment for 1 h significantly increased the reporter gene expression. It is likely that BK increases the level of intracellular cAMP, and thus activates PKA, resulting in the desensitization of the BK response.

These findings suggest that 5-HT inhibits excitatory neurons and excites inhibitory neurons in the SG through activation of 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 3 receptors, respectively. The reciprocal postsynaptic actions of 5-HT on SG neurons in addition to presynaptic inhibitory effects on primary afferents might play an important role in descending control of nociceptive transmission by 5-HT. We examined effects of levobupivacaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine and R-bupivacaine on EPSCs in substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons of the spinal dorsal horn evoked by dorsal root stimulation, and on action potentials in dorsal root ganglion neurons generated by the dorsal root stimulation. In SG neurons, levobupivacaine reversibly suppressed the amplitude of monosynaptic A\u2426 and C fiber-evoked EPSCs. However, A\u2424 fiber-evoked EPSCs were slightly inhibited in amplitude. On the other hand, bupivacaine equally suppressed those three fiber-evoked EPSCs. In DRG neurons, IC 50 of bupivacaine and R-bupivacaine were almost equal on A\u2424, A\u2426 and C neurons. However, IC 50 of levobupivacaine and ropivacaine on A\u2426 and C neurons were lower than that on A\u2424 neurons. The present results suggest that pure S (\u2212) enantiomers especially levobupivacaine effectively inhibits noxious transmission to the spinal dorsal horn by the blockade of AP conduction through A\u2426 and C fibers.",

Fukui, Fukui, Japan NO plays an important role in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in spinal dorsal horn, which is believed to underlie hyperalgesia and allodynia. In this study, to elucidate the relationship of NO to LTP, we measured the spatiotemporal distribution of NO signal with the NO-sensitive dye, and neuronal excitation with the voltagesensitive dye, in rat spinal cord slices. In superficial dorsal horn, neuronal excitation evoked by dorsal root stimulation was potentiated for more than 2 h after low-frequency conditioning stimulation (LFS). In the same slices that exhibited LTP, NO was produced and distributed in the superficial dorsal horn during LFS. LTP and production of NO were inhibited in the presence of NO synthase inhibitors and an inhibitor of heme oxygenase, the synthetic enzyme for carbon monoxide (CO).",

In order to further investigate which subtype of glutamate receptors is involved in neurogenic inflammation, effect of NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 or non-NMDA receptor antagonist CNQX was evaluated in hindpaws of pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. Attenuation of skin temperature increase induced by simultaneous MK-801 injection with glutamate was larger than that of skin temperature increase induced by simultaneous CNQX injection with glutamate at the same concentration. On the other hand, inhibition of paw edema formation by CNQX was stronger than by MK-801.

Under these conditions, the immunoreactivities of phosphorylated-Ser-1303 NR2B (p-Ser-1303 NR2B) subunit and phosphorylated-conventional protein kinase C (p-cPKC) were significantly increased in the spinal cord following chronic ethanol consumption, whereas p-Tyr-1472 NR2B subunit immunoreactivity was not changed in this region. The hyperalgesia induced by chronic ethanol consumption was significantly attenuated by repeated i.p. injection of ifenprodil, a selective NR2B-containing NMDA receptor antagonist.

We examined the receptor mechanism underlying this depression of PFC neuron activity. Extracellular neural activities, induced by nociceptive stimulation applied peripherally, were recorded in the rat PFC. Inhibitory effects of HFS delivered to the BL on nociceptive responses were blocked by specific antagonists of a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) or NMDA receptor microinjected locally into the PFC. Dopamine depletion, produced by 6-OHDA injected into the substantia nigra, also reduced the inhibitory effects of HFS.

In this study we hypothesized that, following SCI, neurons in the thalamus undergo similar electrophysiological changes linked to Nav1.3. Four weeks post-SCI, Nav1.3 protein was upregulated within thalamic neurons, where unit recordings revealed increased spontaneous discharge, afterdischarge, hyperresponsiveness to innocuous and noxious peripheral stimuli, expansion of peripheral RFs, and bursting. These properties persisted after interruption of ascending spinal barrage. Lumbar intrathecal administration of specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against Nav1.3 caused a significant reduction in Nav1.3 expression and reversed electrophysiological alterations. These results show, for the first time, a change in sodium channel expression within neurons in the thalamus after injury to the spinal cord, and suggest that these changes contribute to altered processing of somatosensory information after SCI.",

Microglia that were cultured on fibronectin-coated dishes showed a marked increase in P2X4 receptor expression. Western blot examination of the spinal cord from rat with spinal nerve injury indicated that fibronectin was upregulated on the ipsilateral side. Interestingly, intrathecal injection of ATP-stimulated microglia revealed that microglia cultured on fibronectin-coated dishes was more effective in the induction of allodynia than microglia cultured on control dishes.

On the other hand, LPA also caused a decrease in gene expression of various myelin proteins, such as MBP, PMP22, MAG, P0 in cultured fibers. The maximal decrease was observed all at as early as 3 h after the addition of LPA. BoNT/C3 and Y27632 abolished the LPAinduced down-regulation of MBP gene. All these findings suggest that the down-regulation of gene expression of myelin proteins is through RhoA-ROCK pathway underlying LPA-induced demyelination.

Co-injection of morphine and MK-801 decreased cold-and mechanoallodynia, but had slightly effect on heat-hyperalgesia. The present data demonstrate that the SNI procedure result in severe changes in behavioral responses in whether hyperalgesia or allodynia.

From these results we have concluded that the muscle became hyperalgesic after LEC. In the present experiment, we examined whether this hyperalgesia after LEC changes along aging. Male SD rats 8, 80 (81-84) and 130 (131-133) w old were used. The basal mechanical threshold (Randall-Selitto method) of EDL muscle tended to be higher in 80 w old rats, but not significant. After LEC, the threshold started to decrease 1 day after LEC in all three age groups. It returned to the pre-LEC level 4 days after LEC in 8 and 80 w old rats only. Recovery of 130 w old rats delayed up to 7 days after LEC. Increased c-Fos expression in the superficial dorsal horn was observed in L4 as well as in L5 in 130 w old rats. These results suggest that hyperalgesia occurs in larger areas and lasts longer in aged animals.",

When Wistar-Imamichi strain female rats received an infusion of anti-metastin antibody into the third ventricle during days 25-39 of age, they did not show the first estrus before 52 days of age with mean age of 54.7 \u00b1 2.0 day.

Vesl proteins bind and regulate mGluR1/5, IP3 receptor, ryanodine receptor, and TRP channel at the postsynapse. The expression of vesl-1S is upregulated by tetanic stimulation that elicits L-LTP.

In this study we generated vesl-1S gene-targeting mice (KO) and examined whether Vesl-1S plays a role in the LTM formation. Analysis with the contextual fear conditioning revealed a defective in consolidation process, reconsolidation process, and remote memory formation in KO. KO further showed an enhanced freezing decrement within a test session, indicating faster within-session extinction. In contrast, consolidation process of the extinction was normal in KO. These results demonstrate that the Vesl-1S protein plays critical roles in various processes of the LTM formation.

Although most of previous studies have focused on elucidating facilitatory effects of estrogen on learning in females, estrogen is also known to affect various behaviors in males. In the present study, we investigated the effects of different doses of estrogen on fear conditioning (FC) learning in both sexes of mice. Gonadectomized C57BL/6J mice were implanted with a silastic capsule containing 0, 5, 10 or 20 g of estradiol benzoate. Since it is possible that estrogen may indirectly modify learning by affecting general activity, emotionality and anxiety levels, we tested the mice in open-field and light dark transition paradigms prior to FC. Mice were then conditioned for fear responses (freezing) to tone stimulus and tested for both contextual and cued FC responses. We found that estrogen facilitated both types of FC learning in females, whereas it inhibited them in males especially at a higher dose, with a small effect on emotional behaviors.",

In the present study, we combined single cell tracing with immunohistochemistry for mu opioid receptor, which is specifically expressed by patch neurons, to reveal the distribution of thalamostriatal axon terminals in relation to striatal compartments. Recombinant Sindbis virus expressing membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein (palGFP) was injected into the rat thalamus. A single neuron in the thalamic paraventricular nucleus extensively projected to the striatum and preferentially to patch compartment compared with matrix compartment. The axons were also distributed in the thalamic reticular nucleus, accumbens nucleus, amygdala, and cerebral cortex.",

Mol. Genet., Fukushima Medi. Univ., Japan; 3 CREST, JST, Kawaguchi, Japan Dopamine transmission is thought to be important for rodents to perform operant behaviors such as lever pressing. The lever pressing experiment was conducted to examine the effects of 6-OHDA injections into the nucleus accumbens (Acb) in C57BL/6J mice. All mice were trained to press the lever for a food pellet using a fixed ratio 5 (FR5) schedule. The mice were injected with ascorbate vehicle or 6-OHDA into the Acb, and then tested post-surgically using the FR5 schedule again. The 6-OHDA-injected mice showed the acceleration of response speed, which was revealed by the shortening of interresponse time between each of the five lever pressings, and the suppression of the initiation of the response to the next step. This suppression of initiation was revealed by the increase of time from the last presentation of food to the next initiation. These results suggest that the Acb dopamine system is important for the initiation and control of the operant behaviors in rodents.",

Univ., Japan It has been shown previously that the dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) selectively respond to a stimulus repeatedly paired with reward stimuli in a classical conditioning paradigm. Since the VTA receives dense projection from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), such response selectivity of VTA neurons may in part be produced by inputs from the mPFC. However, few studies have compared the firing pattern between these two regions. Our present experiment was designed to make such a comparison in freely moving rats. Two different tones were sequentially presented, one of which (target, 30%) was paired with intracranial simulation of the reward area. The unit activity was recorded from the mPFC and/or the VTA. PFC and VTA neurons exhibited phasic excitation with the peak latency of about 0.1 s to both tones, while only the target tone induced sustained activation of firing activity lasting until presentation of the reward.",

Very recent monkey study (Alvarado et al., 2005) demonstrated that lesion of the hippocampus produced a significant impairment in that task and supported such a theory.

In the present study, we examined effects of lesion of the monkey perirhinal cortex on transverse patterning task using two sets of 2D visual stimuli presented in a WGTA. Our three monkeys with perirhinal lesions failed to attain a learning criterion within a training limit of 75 sessions in phase 3, although they learned easily the four problems in phases 1 and 2. Our results suggest that the perirhinal cortex, but not the hippocampus, is important for learning of transverse patterning task, that is, for formation of relational memory.",

Sch. of Tsukuba Univ., Tsukuba, Japan A recent dopamine D2 receptor study using antisense cDNA showed that D2 receptor in rhinal cortex is crucial for learning associations between visual stimuli and reward schedules. Neuronal responses in the perirhinal cortex differentiate the visual cues only when the cues are associated with the schedule states, while those in area TE are related to physical attributes of the cue independently of the schedule states. To investigate the cellular substrate for D2mediated associative learning, we examined monkey temporal lobe immunohistochemically with a D2 receptor antipeptide antiserum. D2 receptor immunoreactivity was observed in the pyramidal cells in layers II-VI of the rhinal cortex and area TE. The signal was mainly observed in cell bodies, and also in both apical and basal dendrites for some cells. The signal in layers V-VI was stronger in area 36 of the perirhinal cortex than in area TEav. The differential localization between area 36 and TE suggests the differential roles of the two areas in associative learning process. By using axonal transport of Fast Blue, Diamidino yellow and tritiated amino acids, we determined the afferent and efferent connections of the retrosplenial cortex (Rsp) in the macaque monkey. The Rsp receives heavy projections from the subiculum, presubiculum and the caudal entorhinal areas (EC-ECL), and projects back to the presubiculum and the EC-ECL. The supracallosal portion of the Rsp has connections primarily with the caudal half of the subiculum and presubiculum, as well as the lateral zone of the EC-ECL. The caudoventral portion of the Rsp is, in contrast, mainly connected with the rostral half of the subiculum and presubiculum as well as the medial zone of the EC-ECL. The two portions of the Rsp, thus, have access to different portions of the medial temporal lobe. These results indicate that there are two distinct neural systems in the retrosplenial-medial temporal network.",

The result shows that the increase of theta power at F3 and F4 was the highest and suggests that the theta rhythm at F3 and F4 may have a relationship to the process of English rhythm acquisition. Moreover we found the highest increase in theta power when the subjects began to orally reproduce every line of the rhythm materials. This finding was observed in three right handlers except a left handler and a right handler who had just returned after 6-month English study experience in Australia.

The S-cell network of the medicinal leech is a chain of electrically coupled interneurons spanning the nerve cord with distributed sensory input and motor output and is crucial for sensitization of reflex shortening. Its firing increases with sensitization although few additional S-cells initiate impulses during the reflex. We tested the hypothesis that the initial burst of impulses from the S-cell in the stimulated segment suppresses initiations in adjacent segments. Hyperpolarizing the central S-cell to reduce its firing during skin stimulation markedly increased the number of initiations in adjacent S-cells, which corroborated the limited expansion of initiation sites seen in the behaving animal.

To elucidate the mechanism, we have constructed a model of the prefrontal cortical neural circuit for working memory. The neurons in the model are leaky integrate-and-fire model with AMPA, NMDA, GABA, and leak conductances and have dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. The computer simulation with this model shows that D1 receptor activation mainly affect working memory activity itself, while D2 receptor activation affect the termination of working memory, being consistent with the experimental result. The simulation also mimics the hyper-and hypo-dopaminergic states. Under such conditions, like schizophrenia, simulated pharmacological treatments using agonists and antagonists of D1 and D2 receptors indicate efficacies of some these treatments for the restoration of working memory.

However, conventional IEG approaches that use immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization allow to detect neurons only shortly after their activation and does not enable genetic manipulations. Here we have developed transgenic mice that allow selective and long-lasting tagging of neurons that were activated in a given brain region at a given time point. The mice consist of two components; c-fos promoter driven tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) and tetO promoter regulated feedback loop. When strong neuronal activity occurs in the absence of tetracycline analogs such as doxycycline (Dox), c-fos promoter driven tTA initiates the tetO-linked expression of mutant tTA (tTA*) that is not inhibited by Dox. This tetO-linked gene expression is then maintained indefinitely by feedback activation via the tTA* even in the presence of Dox. Using this system, we have examined the expression of bicistronic tetO promoter driven tau-lacZ and EGFP-GluR1.",

Because Hippocampus is an important area for memory formation, the present study is scheduled to investigate the effect of insulin injection in CA1region of hippocampus on memory formation. Fifty male rats were divided into five groups. (1) control (2) sham operation (3) test (4) diabetic/saline (5) diabetic/insulin. Groups 4 and 5 were made diabetic by treatment with STZ (50 mg/kg, i.p.). In all but the control group, two canula were stereotaxically implanted in CA1 region of hippocampus. Learning was tested and compared between groups through passive avoidance test. Results showed that in the test group the latency increased as compared to control and sham groups (p < 0.05). Compared to sham group diabetic/insulin group showed increased latency (p < 0.05) but no significant difference was found between diabetic/saline and diabetic/insulin groups. In conclusion, according to the results obtained in this study, insulin facilitates memory in intact rats but not in diabetic Sex differences in hippocampus-dependent memory formation are well documented, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. The Ca 2+ /calmodulin (CaM) kinase cascade regulates gene transcription in the hippocampus, which is required for long-term memory (LTM) formation. We hypothesized that sex differences in transcriptional regulation may account for the sexual dimorphisms in memory formation. We tested this idea by studying the role of CaM kinase kinases (CaMKKs). Using mouse molecular genetics we found that CaMKK\u2424 is required for spatial, but not contextual LTM. Consistent with the impaired spatial memory formation, CaMKK\u2424 null mutants lacked spatial training-induced CREB activation and had impaired late LTP. In contrast to CaMKK\u2424, CaMKK\u2423 is required for contextual, but not for spatial LTM. Furthermore, female CaMKK mutants had normal spatial and contextual LTM. Thus, we show that there are malespecific mechanisms to regulate gene transcription that may explain sex differences in hippocampus-dependent memory formation.",

Frequency of S/N polymorphism was significantly high suggesting that exchange of serine to asparagine at position 167 of protein affects the secondary structure or hydrophobicity of the protein resulting in pathogenicity.

Activated glia observed in MPTP mouse model and in PD may participate in the cascade of deleterious events that ultimately leads to dopaminergic nigral neuronal death. Estrogen can modify glial expression of inflammatory mediator, such as cytokines and chemokines implicated in neurodegeneration. To determine whether estrogen-elicited neuroprotection in PD is mediated through glia, adult male C57Bl/6 mice were pretreated with 17beta-estradiol (E2), injected with MPTP on the day 6 and brains were collected on day 11. E2 pretreatment decreased nigral neuronal loss and diminished striatal fibers deficit induced by MPTP. The neuroprotective effect of E2 was coincident with an attenuation of a glial response within the SNpc and striatum. These findings propose that E2 neuroprotection in MPTP mouse model may mediate through reactive glia inhibition.",

Compared with the normal state, spontaneous oscillatory discharges were so often observed in the GPe/GPi and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of the parkinsonian monkeys. Microinjections of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists into the vicinity of recorded GPe/GPi neurons reduced their abnormal oscillations. These results suggest that glutamatergic excitatory input from the STN contributes to the oscillatory activity of GPe/GPi neurons, and that intrapallidal injections of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists may ameliorate some of parkinsonian symptoms. One of the pathological features of Parkinson\u01d0s disease (PD) is loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars comapacta (SNpc). And it has been known that \u2423-synuclein is involved in the neuronal loss. During the dopaminergic neuronal loss, activated microglia were centered in SNpc. We hypothesize that \u2423-synuclein may play a role in microglial activation to migrate to the pathological regions and to perform the neuronal cytotoxicity. We demonstrated that \u2423-synuclein induced the CD44 expression on microglia and also enhanced the MT1-MMP expression to shed off CD44 at the cell surface and degrade surrounding ECM to open the migratory way. A53T mutant \u2423-synuclein showed greater level of CD44 shedding and cell migration. Extracellular treated \u2423-synuclein also increased CD44 and MT1-MMP expressions dose-dependently. Among the multiple signaling pathways, ERK pathway was involved in \u2423-synuclein induced cell migration. These induced cell migration were also confirmed in human PD patients.",

Dopamine released from these axons and dendrites is important in the regulation of motor activity. In Parkinson's disease, dopaminergic neurons in the SNC degenerate. L-DOPA is the most effective drug for this disease. We hypothesize that, in Parkinson's disease, a part of administered L-DOPA is converted to dopamine in serotonergic fibers of the ST and SNR. Here we produced parkinsonian model rats by the unilateral injection of 6hydroxydopamine into the SNC, and found that serotonergic fibers in the ST and SNR were immunohistochemically positive for dopamine after L-DOPA administration in the rats. Therefore, it is possible that serotonergic neurons may be involved in the therapeutic effects of L-DOPA for Parkinson's disease. In MPTP-induced PD monkey, reactive microglia are observed around neurons in nigra several years after MPTP treatment and may be related to the progression of PD. To evaluate if reactive microglia in striatum and/or nigra of MPTP-induced PD mice are present for a long time after MPTP administration, like PD monkey. Iba 1-and Tb4distribution in microglia were immunohistochemically investigated at 0 h and 7 days after twice MPTP-treatments (one treatment comprised of 4 intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg MPTP at 2 h interval) to C57BL/6 and BALB/c at 6 months (Mo) interval. The recognizable change of Iba 1-and Tb4-distibution in microglia of both mice strains was observed even 6 Mo after the first treatment. The twice MPTP treatments tended to aggravate the symptoms in both mice strains, compared with once treatment. These results suggest that reactive microglia are present for a long time after the treatment by MPTP and must play a role in the chronic progression of PD.",

We generated Pael-R transgenic mice and crossbred it with parkin knockout mice. Pael-R transgenic mice showed modest alterations in dopamine metabolism and behavioral deficits without displaying obvious dopaminergic neuronal loss at the age of one year. However, when Pael-R transgenic mice were crossbred with parkin knockout mice, the DA neuronal loss was induced in a Pael-R gene dosage-dependant manner. These results strongly support that Pael-R accumulation substantially contributes to dopaminergic neurodegeneration in AR-JP. Parkinson's disease, a common motor disorder, is caused by a degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. After dopamine denervation, an over-activity of glutamatergic pathways has been found and that is implicated in the neuropathology of Parkinson's disease. Previous study (Lai et al., 2004) have found that application of an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide specific for NR1 have successfully knockdown the expression of NR1 gene expression in the striatum of 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats. In the present study, modulation of gene expression of NR1 was re-addressed using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for NR1. In PC12 cells, reductions of NR1 proteins after a single application of NR1 siRNA were found by western blot experiments. And after one single application of NR1 siRNA in the striatum of the lesioned rats, a significant reduction in apomorphine-induced rotation was found. Slight reductions in the levels of NR1 immunofluorescence were found in the striatum after the siRNA treatments. Lai et al., 2004. Neurochem. Int. 45, 11-22.

Chandra, K.P. Mohanakumar Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India Homocysteine (Hcy) is implicated in a number of geriatric multisystem disorders and patients with hyperhomocysteinemia exhibit profound neuropsychological abnormalities. Parkinson\u01d0s disease (PD) patients receiving long-term L-DOPA therapy are reported to have elevated plasma Hcy levels. We studied whether Hcy is neurotoxic to the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA)-ergic system in SD rats. Animals infused unilaterally in substantia nigra pers compacta (SNpc) with Hcy (0.25-1 mol in 1 l) showed dose dependent loss of DA and its metabolites, in the ipsilateral striatum on 19th day. Animals with 1 mol Hcy exhibited significant motor disabilities and spontaneous and DA-ergic drug-induced turning behaviors. In these animals a clear loss of neurons was visible in SNpc, which were shown to be DAergic by tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity. Intra-raphe infusion of Hcy did not alter the neurotransmitter levels in the serotonergic perikarya or terminals. These results indicate the toxic potential of Hcy to the DA-ergic system and suggest that chronic L-DOPA therapy in PD patients may further deteriorate the disease.",

Mol. Pharmacol. Neurosci., Grad. Sch. Biomed. Sci., Hiroshima Univ., Hiroshima, Japan; 2 Lab. Mol. Pharmacol., Biosig. Res. Ctr., Kobe Univ., Kobe, Japan We have previously demonstrated that several mutant protein kinase C gamma (\u2425PKC), found in several families of spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14), are susceptible to cytoplasmic aggregation and cause cell death in CHO cells, indicating that this property is involved in the etiology of SCA14. However, the relationship between the aggregate formation of mutant \u2425PKC and cell death remains unclear. Accumulating evidences indicate that the impairment of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is related to the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, we examined whether the aggregate formation of mutant \u2425PKC affects UPS function. The immunoreactivities for ubiquitin and proteasome were intensely accumulated in the aggregates of mutant \u2425PKC. Decreased proteasome activities were also observed in cells having aggregated mutant \u2425PKC. These results indicate that the aggregation of mutant \u2425PKC exert cytotoxic effect via the impairment of UPS. It is well known that oxidant stress is involved in many pathologic conditions including brain ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, however, another type of stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has also been reported to be associated with such diseases. ER stress is characterized by accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER that is caused by inhibition of protein modification, disturbance of Ca 2+ homeostasis or oxygen deprivation. We recently reported that targeting disruption of Herp, a novel ER stress-related gene, caused F9 cells vulnerable to ER stress. Using these cells, we developed a screening system for molecules that suppress ER stress. Approximately 300 compounds have been screened, and we found some molecules that protect human neuroblastoma cells against ER stress and oxidative stress. We speculate that this system could provide novel therapeutic targets to the ER stress and oxidative stressrelated diseases.",

We previously reported that increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) production by the overexpression of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase1 (Nmnat1) or exogenously applied NAD can protect neurites from degeneration caused by mechanical or neurotoxic injury of neuronal cells. The mammalian NAD biosynthesis is mediated by at least 6 different kinds of enzymes and each enzyme converts different substrate to NAD or its precursors. Here we investigated whether overexpression of these enzymes or exogenous application of NAD precursors protects neurites from degeneration through increased supply of NAD. Cocaine is considered to affect spine morphology and the composition of postsynaptic density (PSD) of medium spiny neurons in nucleus accumbens (NAc). We examined the accumulation of several proteins altered by cocaine challenge after withdrawal of repeated cocaine administration in PSD fraction of rat NAc at different time points. Total PSD protein yield was decreased at 10 min, but next increased at 2 h and returned to basal at 6 h after cocaine challenge. Actin showed a similar pattern but was maintained at high level at 6 h. Both PSD-95 and GluR1 were increased between 2 h and 6 h like actin. By contrast, some proteins such as drebrin were decreased after the peak at 2 h. Interestingly, the 20 S proteasome subunit demonstrated a dramatic upregulation at 2 h. These data suggest that the composition of PSD proteins is regulated by proteasome activity as well as actin cycling. It is possible that some proteins may be removed from PSD by proteasome following transient requirement for organizing PSD in the NAc of chronic cocaine-administrated animals.",

As previously reported, MDMA (0.3-10 M) dose-dependently induced transport-associated, inward current response in the SERTexpressing cells. Interestingly, MDMA-induced current response was also observed in DAT-expressing cells. On the other hand, 5-MeO-DiPT (0.3-300 nM) evoked an outward current response in SERTexpressing cells similarly to that of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors. No current response was observed when 5-MeO-DiPT was applied to DAT-expressing cells. These results suggest that MDMA is transported not only by SERT but also by DAT, and that 5-MeO-DiPT suppresses the spontaneous transport activity of SERT.",

A single administration of morphine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) to male ICR mice induced a hyperlocomotion. The ANOVA analysis revealed statistical significance of a morphine effect (hyperlocomotion) and of a clorgyline pretreatment x morphine interaction effect (inhibition), but not of an effect of clorgyline pretreatment. Clorgyline pretreatment itself did not affect the spontaneous locomotion. Clorgyline at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg but not other doses tested significantly potentiated morphine-induced antinociception evaluated by tail flick but not hot plate test. Clorgyline at the doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg significantly inhibited dopamine and serotonin metabolism. These results suggest that clorgyline showed its inhibitory effect on morphine-induced hyperlocomotion, but not antinociception, through MAO inhibition. Recent studies in our laboratory have shown that methamphetamine (METH)-induced hyperlocomotion and behavioral sensitization in mice were inhibited by clorgyline, an irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor. In this presentation, the effect of clorgyline pretreatment on METH reward was assessed by conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm, using an apparatus developed with Supermex \u00ae sensors. Although intact male ICR mice showed a significant CPP for METH (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), pretreatment with subchronic clorgyline (0.1-10 mg/kg, s.c.) did not affect the magnitude of CPP. Pretreatment with clorgyline significantly decreased apparent dopamine and serotonin turnovers in the striatum in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicated that clorgyline pretreatment did not influence METH reward in mice.",

            "text": "Previously we showed that endogenous nociceptin suppresses drug reward. Here, we examined the effect of blockade of NOP receptors on methamphetamine (METH) induced behavioral sensitization in order to understand the role of endogenous nociceptin in the chronic response to addictive drugs. First, NOP receptor KO and WT mice were treated with 1 mg/kg METH and locomotor activity measured daily for 14 days. WT mice showed gradually increasing sensitivity to METH with repeated treatment of METH, whereas NOP receptor knockout mice did not. Next, 5 nmol UFP-101 (a NOP receptor antagonist) and 1 mg/kg METH were co-administrated to mice and locomotor activity measured daily for eight days. UFP-101 strongly suppressed locomotor activity. Thus, it was unclear if UFP-101 suppressed behavioral sensitization to METH during chronic drug treatment. However, when challenged with METH after four or more days without treatment, UFP-101 co-administrated mice showed a lower locomotor response. These results suggest that endogenous nociceptin facilitates the plastic changes induced by chronic treatment with addictive drugs. The influence of olanzapine (a D2dopamine receptor antagonist) on the morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in male and female mice was investigated in the present study. Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of morphine (1-10 mg/kg, three drug sessions) induced place preference both in male and female mice. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of olanzapine (0.5-5 mg/kg) induced place aversion (CPA) in female mice but not in male mice. Administration of olanzapine (1, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced both the acquisition and expression of morphine-induced CPP in male and female mice. However, olanzapine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) caused more than 80% mortality in female but not male mice. The effects of olanzapine were reversed by l-arginine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) pre-administration. In conclusion, it seems that olanzapine reduced morphine effects in part via a nitric oxide (NO) mechanism. Feed-forward associative learning (FFAL) theory of cerebellar motor learning proposed by the author presumes that higher motor centers have place-coding systems and the same systems are shared by the cerebellum. When a new motor learning proceeds with respect to a certain movement, previous learning results of the movement will turn out to be modified or erased. FFAL theory presumes that transferred memory from the cerebellar cortex to nucleus will serve as the maintenance of the previous learning. From this line, many aspects of saccadic adaptation are successfully demonstrated by computer simulation based on the theory. Another theoretical issue is the credit assignment problem of motor error. A motor error is generally an integrated result of maladjusted multiple learning elements, and is to be decomposed to each element credit. This problem naively leads to an idea of a dual redundant system for movement, one for execution and the other for error decomposition. FFAL theory naturally and simply resolves the credit assignment problem and demonstrates a computer simulation of motor learning of multi joint movement system, using the place-coding hypothesis.",

Transcription factor, cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) in AM and HF plays important roles in memory modulating processes. CREB is a nuclear protein and is wldely accepted as prototypical stimulusinducible transcription factor. CREB is activated in response to a vast array of physiological stimuli and then becames phosphorylated CREB (pCREB). Neurophysiological and neuropharmacological studies said that CREB may regulate gene transcription and protein synthesis to maintain the long term and sustaining changing of synaptic efficiency during the long-term process of synaptic plasticity. But we cannot tell exactly via what kind of neurons in AM and HF CREB regulate these processes. We used the animal model, forced swimming (FS) as emotional stimuli and the experiment methods such as, immunocytochemistry, western-blotting with anti-pCREB antibody. The distributing profiles and changing rules of pCREB immunoreactive nuclei in amygdala and hippocampal formation of both control and experiment groups were investigated. The neuronal types of pCREB immunoreactive nuclei were analyzed by double-labelling immunocytochemistry with anti-pCREB, anti-Glu and anti-PV antibodies. The results were: (1) The number of pCREB immunoreactive neuclei and total amount of pCREB in the subnuclei of rat amygdala, Dentate gyrus (DG) and Cornu Ammonis 3(CA3) were increased after FS. The rule of this kind of changing was of region-and time-specific. (2) pCREB immunoreactive neuclei were expressed in glutamate immunoreactive neurons and were devoid in interneurons. These results suggested that pCREB in limbic system regulated the FS process and the regulation was finished via exciting neurons, glutamate neurons.",

Drebrin is a spine-rich actin-binding protein regulating spine morphogenesis during development. Here we find that chronic blockade of AMPA receptors (AMPAR) inhibits synaptic drebrin clustering during development of hippocampal neurons, but not that of NMDAR. Further, the analysis of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching for EGFP-drebrin A reveals that only 22.7 \u00b1 3.0% of drebrin in the spine is stable, with a turnover time of 5.8 \u00b1 0.4 min. Blockade of AMPAR by 20 M CNQX reduces the population of stable drebrin (8.9 \u00b1 3.6%), and has no effect on a turnover time. On the other hand, blockade of NMDAR by 100 M AP5 has no effect on the population of stable drebrin, whereas shortens a turnover time (4.0 \u00b1 0.3 min). These data suggest that AMPAR activities increase the binding capacity of drebrin in spines, and therefore promote drebrin clustering at spine synapses. Instead, NMDAR activities regulate spine-shaft shuttling of drebrin.",

Synaptopodin (SYNPO), an F-actin-associated protein, increases in the activated synapses following L-LTP induction. Spine volume and F-actin content in the spines also increase during L-LTP. To reveal the roles SYNPO plays in the regulation of spine volume and F-actin content, we examined SYNPO-EGFP (SE) localization and spine volume in the hippocampal neurons using time-lapse confocal imaging techniques. SE-overexpression did not alter spine volume, but the amount of SE in spines positively correlated with the spine volume. Pharmacological activation of the NMDA receptors increased both spine volume and SYNPO content in spines. Furthermore, experiments with PtK2 cells indicated that SYNPO stabilizes F-actin. These results suggest that SYNPO synthesized in soma and transported into the activated spines following L-LTP induction stabilizes spine F-actin that may lead to the maintenance of increased spine volume.",

Using live-imaging techniques, we measured entry of Vesl-1S-EGFP into spines (VE trapping) of rat hippocampal neurons in culture, and found that VE trapping activity serves as the synaptic tag in many criteria. VE trapping required synergistic activation of postsynaptic NO-PKG pathway and an activity abolished by TTX at 1 M, but not 50 nM. Because 50 nM TTX is supposed to suppress Na channels only postsynaptically, we concluded that VE trapping is a Hebbian-like process that requires both pre-and postsynaptic activities. However, their coincidence time window was far wider (hrs) than that of early-phase plasticity, suggesting a requirement of persistently synchronized, rather than transiently coincident, activities, and a possibility of metaplastic states for late-phase plasticity.",

In extreme cases, long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) coexist in the same synaptic pathway with LTP dominating over LTD at higher levels of presynaptic activity.

When chicks were reared in quasi-dark condition, the extent and amplitude of response induced by electrical stimulation were different between at 1 or 4 days post-hatching (P1 or P4), and at P7. This corresponds to behavioral data showing that chicks have high ability of visual learning in imprinting behavior until P4, but they lose this ability at P7. In addition, the light-exposed chick showed larger optical response than the dark-rearing one. The optical response in the VW was partly inhibited by the glutamate-and GABA-receptor antagonists.

Computer simulation reproduced the bistable states of GABA A R phospholyration according to stimulation patterns, which apparently corresponded to whether RP was induced or not.

After pairing slight postsynaptic depolarization with presynaptic stimulation, LTD was reliably induced at both HVC and LMAN inputs in juvenile birds from 35 to 42 days old. This depression required activation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors, and was expressed by decreased transmitter release, which required activation of cannabinoid receptors.

We recently found an apparently mirror-image phenomenon; 3 inductions of LTD led to a long-lasting synaptic decrement coupled with a decrease in the numbers of synaptic structures. To know whether this synaptic decrement also requires protein synthesis, we induced LTD 3 times (24 h intervals) by applications of DHPG (a type I mGluR agonist), during or after which anisomycin (a protein translation blocker) was applied. We found that anisomycin did not block the induction of LTD but blocked the establishment of the long-lasting synaptic decrement.",

The 5-HT 1B receptor agonist CP93129 mimicked the presynaptic inhibitory effect of 5-HT. 5-HT 1B receptor antagonist NAS-181 reversed the 5-HT inhibitory effect, indicating that the 5-HT induced inhibitory effect occurs by mediating 5-HT 1B receptors. The presynaptic inhibitory effect of 5-HT became weaker as animals matured. In whole-cell recordings from calyceal presynaptic terminals, 5-HT attenuated voltage-dependent calcium currents, but had no effect on potassium currents. This 5-HT effect was characterized with a marked desensitization, but sustained under the fast calcium chelating agents, BAPTA. These results suggest that 5-HT, upon activating 5-HT 1B receptors, inhibits presynaptic calcium channels thereby inhibiting transmitter release and induces receptor desensitization by calcium influx at the immature calyceal synapse.",

Med., Osaka Univ., Osaka, Japan Retrograde endocannabinoid signal contributes to activitydependent modulation of synaptic transmissions in various brain regions. Endocannabinoid release is triggered by depolarizationinduced elevation of intracellular calcium level or activation of Gq-coupled receptors. Here we report that NMDA receptors can also contribute to generation of endocannabinoid signal. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were recorded in cultured hippocampal neurons prepared from newborn rats. Application of NMDA induced a transient suppression of cannabinoid-sensitive IPSCs but not cannabinoid-insensitive IPSCs. The NMDA-induced suppression of IPSC was blocked by a cannabinoid receptor antagonist. These results indicate that activation of NMDA receptors induces the endocannabinoid release, and suppresses the inhibitory synaptic transmission through activation of presynaptic cannabinoid receptors. The most caudal region of the rat spinal cord, the conus medullaris has a simple anatomical feature, which lacks ventral as well as dorsal root fibers and somatic motor neurons in the ventral horn. A small number of neurons distribute around the central canal, and some of them are nitric oxide synthase (NOS) positive. A dense distribution of nerve fibers immunoreactive to CGRP, SP, and NPY was found in dorsal part of the conus medullaris similarly to that of other spinal cord levels. In addition, ENK-, 5-HT-, and TH-immunoreactive varicose fibers were richly distributed throughout the sectional plane. To analyze this unique structure may provide valuable information on the basic neural cytoarchitecture and fiber connections of the spinal cord, particularly for the intraspinal circuitry. For this purpose, we made an electron microscopic study using NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry combined with immunohistochemistry for neuronal markers. Adenosine has been known to be a neuro-modulator in the nervous systems and four types of adenosine receptor are identified (A1, A2a, A2b and A3). Adenosine A1 and A3 receptors have been reported to inhibit high-threshold Ca channel currents in neurons. To investigate the interaction between adenosine A1 and A3 receptors in rat striatum neurons in culture, L-type Ca channel currents were recorded by whole-cell clamp method before and after administration of A1 agonist (CPA) and A3 agonist (2-Cl-IB-MECA). Ca currents were decreased after administration of low concentration of CPA and 2-CL-IB-MECA as reported previously. Although Ca currents were decreased by 2-Cl-IB-MECA in the presence of CPA, Ca currents applied with CPA were not decreased on cells in the presence of 2-Cl-IB-MECA. At administration of CPA and 2-Cl-IB-MECA on cells simultaneously, Ca currents were not decreased. These results suggested that adenosine A3 receptor may inhibit adenosine A1 receptor throughout a intracellular pathway in neurons.",

There was no significant difference in distribution of radially migrating cells that was labeled by means of electroporation.

The stimulation of the dorsal raphe promoted longer up-states. Moreover, 60% of the CS were inhibited by 5-HT through 5-HT 1A R and 6% were excited through 5-HT 2A R.

Another inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine could be transported into synaptic vesicles by VGAT, and be co-released with GABA. Several molecules related to GABAergic or glycinergic neurotransmission are expressed in nonneural tissues, suggesting that GABAergic and glycinergic systems exert their activities outside the CNS. VGAT-deficient mice die in the perinatal period, and display omphalocele, defect in ventral body wall closure, suggesting that GABA and/or glycine are involved in body wall formation.

In the present study, we evolved this measurement system to allow observations of spontaneous or GABA-mediated glutamate release from developing postnatal acute cerebellar slices.

The present study aimed to explore what kind of second messengers and the precise site of synaptic membrane, pre-or postsynaptic, is involved in these noradrenergic modulation. The suppressive effect by activation of \u2423 1 -adrenoceptors was mediated by protein kinase C, and excitatory effect by activation of \u2424-adrenoceptors was mediated by cAMP/protein kinase A cascade. Phenylephrine suppressed inward currents evoked by puff application of glutamate, and it decreased mEPSC amplitude and increased mIPSC frequency. Isoproterenol increased mEPSC frequency and decreased mIPSC amplitude. GABA-induced postsynaptic currents were suppressed by isoproterenol. These results suggest that phenylephrine may decrease postsynaptic currents through glutamate receptors and increase the release probability of GABA from presynaptic terminals. On the other hand, isoproterenol may facilitate glutamate release and suppress GABA A receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents.",

Mol. Genetics, Nat'l. Inst. Neurosci., NCNP, Tokyo, Japan; 2 Lab. Pharmacol., Fac. Pharm. Sci., Tokyo Univ. Sci., Chiba, Japan Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), which is a well-known toxic gas and facilitates the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation, has been proposed as a neuromodulator in the brain. The aim of this study is to understand the mechanism of regulation on synaptic transmission by H 2 S. We examined the effect of H 2 S on spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) as well as paired-pulse facilitations using both whole-cell and field potential recordings from rat hippocampal slices. Sodium sulfide (Na 2 S), a donor of H 2 S, reduced the amplitude of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials and increased the ratio of paired-pulse facilitation. The frequency and the amplitude of sEPSC were initially reduced by Na 2 S then gradually increased, while the inward currents elicited by glutamate were not significantly suppressed by Na 2 S. These observations suggest that H 2 S may modulate glutamatergic synaptic transmission by suppressing the release of a transmitter. Several studies show that activation of Locus coeruleus (LC) play an important role in the symptoms of opiate withdrawal. In this study the effects of LC inactivation on self-administration of Morphine and on morphine withdrawal syndrome in rats has been investigated. Male rats were anaesthetized and implanted with silastic catheters inserted in to the right jugular vein. After 5 days animals were fitted and the external end of the catheter was connected with a syringedriven pump, then were placed in the self-administration apparatus. LC was inactivated by (1 l) lidocaein (2%) 5 min before training. Animals were allowed to self administer morphine (1 mg/kg per inf.) ten consecutive daily 2-h session. During all morphine self administration session lever pressing was measured. Our results show that: (1) LC inactivation produced a significant decrease in the initiation of morphine self administration during all session. After the last test session morphine withdrawal symptom signs (MWS) precipitated by naloxone were measured. (2) Most of MWS were decreased by LC inactivation in comparison with morphine group. These results suggest that extracellular ATP plays a dual role in astrocytic Ca 2+ wave propagation with activation of distinct purinergic receptors in the hippocampus of the rats.",

Especially, hippocampus is the largest target of stress. These phenomena are caused by glucocorticoids which are synthesized at adrenal when suffering stress. On the other hand, 17\u2424 estradiol is one of the neuro protective factors and rescues neural death caused by several neurotoxins, such as \u2424-amyloid, glutamate, glucocorticoids. In this study, we focused attention on the acute effects of steroid hormones and researched the effects of glucocorticoids and estradiol on rat hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP), which is the index of learning and memory. The results was that corticosterone (glucocorticoid of rat) acutely reduced LTP via glucocorticoid receptor. 17\u2424 estradiol rescued this reduction via estrogen receptor \u2423 and \u2424. So we found that 17\u2424 estradiol affected not only neuro protection but synaptic protection from stress-induced suppression of synaptic transmission acutely.",

Sch. of Med., Gunma University, Gunma, Japan It is well known that Mg 2+ plays an important role not only in energy metabolism, but also in neural information processing. However, the mechanism of such a role in CNS is not well understood. Previously we reported that neural activity and the intracellular Ca 2+ concentration are largely affected by Mg 2+ removal in cultured cortical neurons of the rat. Transient glutamate release was also detected. In the present study, we investigated effects of the Mg 2+ removal on neural activity in cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons. In particular, we measured the intra-and extracellular Mg 2+ concentration and their actions on neural activity using a Mg 2+ indicator, KMG-20-AM together with Fluo4-AM. We observed different effects of the Mg 2+ removal on GABAergic and non-GABAergic neurons by using GAD67-GFP knock-in mice.",

During development, transiently high levels of synaptic Zn occur in both sensory and nonsensory cortical areas. By injecting the retrograde tracer sodium selenite into barrel cortex, we demonstrated a transient subset of Zn + thalamocortical neurons from P7-P13. Zn + cortical neurons were also labeled, intrinsic and extrinsic, from P5. Unlike in the adult, these were in layer 5, instead of layers 2, 3, and 6. At P9, neurons occurred in layers 2, 3, and 5 and, in some areas, layer 4. At P15, Zn + neurons first appeared in layer 6; and at P22, there is the adult lamination. As whisking and exploratory behavior commences in the second postnatal week, these transient Zn + terminations may play a role in experience-dependent adjustments in cortical circuitry.",

In the present study, we reduced the size and weight and measured dopamine (DA) currents in vivo with the wireless system mounted on the back of the rat. A single-step voltage pulse (100 to 250 mV for DA; 300 to 450 mV for 5HT) was applied at 4 Hz through a carbon electrode that was chronically implanted in the striatum. After administration of L-DOPA, DA currents showed a gradual increase in good agreement with the data measured with conventional systems.

Yeast twohybrid system was conducted with drebrin as bait, and a novel drebrin binding protein was isolated. In neurons, this protein was localized primarily in nucleus and dendritic spines. Hence, we named it Spikar for its unique intracellular localization in spine and karyoplasm. We studied the role of Spikar in spine formation. Hippocampal neurons were transfected with shRNA expression vector for Spikar at several developmental stages. In early stage, Spikar knock down (KD) did not affect the density of dendritic protrusions that were mostly filopodia. In contrast, Spikar KD reduced spine density at the stage of synapse formation. These results suggest that Spikar plays a role in the formation of dendritic spines, without affecting the filopodia formation.",

The in situ hybridization analysis revealed that MAL mRNA was highly and developmentally expressed in hippocampus and broadly expressed in cortex, olfactory bulb.

Although the highly invasive migration of glioblastoma in the brain is known to be influenced by a variety of ion channels, there were a little evidence about the relationships among the morphological changes and ion homeostasis. To clarify it, we have developed a glioma cell culture system for the simultaneous observation of the cell movement and Ca 2+ and Cl \u2212 imaging.

We found that FGF-1 is co-released with S100A13, a Ca 2+ binding protein from cultured rat astrocytes upon the serum-deprivation stress. Here, we report that FGF-1 is co-released with S100A13 from the axon and dendrites in cultured rat hippocampal neurons upon depolarization stimulation, but serum-deprivation stress leads to release, which is seen in neurites as well as in soma. The interaction between FGF-1 and S100A13 required Ca 2+ . The overexpression of S100A13 88-98 mutant lacking an ability of interaction with FGF-1 inhibited the their release, suggesting that S100A13 is a cargo molecule. The release of FGF-1 upon either stimulation was abolished by voltage-dependent N-type Ca 2+ channel blocker. These findings suggest that Ca 2+ influx may be involved in the unpolarized non-vesicular release of FGF-1. In neuron, intracellular calcium involves a large number of physiological phenomena, including cell migration, differentiation, and neurite outgrowth. PC12 cell is a useful model of neural differentiation and neurite outgrowth, and recently we demonstrated that 5-HT has an effect on neurite outgrowth via the increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ) in PC12 cells. However, it is unclear how [Ca 2+ ] i regulates neurite outgrowth via actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we investigated effects of [Ca 2+ ] i on actin dynamics in PC12 cells transfected with YFP-actin. Filopodial growth speed and actin retrograde flow were increased by treatment with calcium ionophore, A23187. Treatment with calcineurin inhibitors decreased the filopodial growth speed, while treatment with CaMK inhibitor did not. These effects could contribute to 5-HT induced enhancement of neurite elongation. The actin cytoskeleton is a complex protein network that not only provides cellular structure but is fundamental for cellular dynamics. On stimulation of PC12 cells by NGF, proteins that directly interact with F-actin such as actinin rapidly translocate to the F-actin-rich cytoskeleton. CLP36 is a PDZ-LIM protein which was originally identified as an actinin-interacting protein in skeletal muscles. Here, we show that CLP36 is endogenously expressed in PC12 cells and plays an important role in actin dynamics during NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Immunofluorescent studies showed that CLP36 is accumulated in irregular cell surface and membrane extrusion soon after NGF-stimulation, where colocalized with actin filaments. We next performed RNAi experiments to explore the role of CLP36 in actin dynamics in growth cones and found that knockdown of CLP36 expression lead to the suppression of NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth. In addition, we revealed using CLP36 deletion mutants that both of PDZ and LIM domains are necessary for the proper function of CLP36.",

In an attempt to identify molecules that regulate the motility of migrating neurons, we focused on migrating cortical interneurons, and performed subtractive hybridization, differential screening and in situ hybridization. Subtraction was done between the embryonic and postnatal interneurons, because they robustly migrate prenatally but not postnatally. Among the 2208 clones tested, two genes, neuronatin and seizure related gene 6 (SEZ-6) attracted our attention. They were expressed in the subventricular zone of the embryonic cortex, implicating that these molecules are expressed in interneuron subpopulations. Postnatally, mRNA signals were hardly detectable.

The migratory behaviour and the underlying molecular mechanisms of tangential migration are poorly understood. We address these issues using the hindbrain precerebellar system as model system. Precerebellar neurons, born dorsally in the lower rhombic lip, migrate in close association with the pial membrane (except inferior olive neurons) ventrally or rostroventrally. We therefore studied the role of pia-secreted chemokine SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4 in the precerebellar migration. We show that CXCR4 is expressed in the migrating precerebellar neurons, and its expression is down-regulated towards the end of migration. In CXCR4 and SDF-1 knock out mice, migrating precerebellar neurons are less confined to the pial surface. More strikingly, the rostrally-directed migration of pontine precerebellar neurons is severely disrupted, leading to a caudalized ectopic pontine-like cluster.",

In this study, we analyze the involvement of NEPH family transmembrane proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily in the migration of precerebellar neurons (PCNs). Postmitotic PCNs derived from the rhombic lip in the hindbrain first migrate tangentially along the pial surface, followed by radial migration to settle at their final positions (Kawauchi, D., Taniguchi, H., Watanabe, H., Saito, T., and Murakami, F., Development, in press ). In situ hybridization analysis showed that among NEPH family members including NEPH1, NEPH2/mKirre, and NEPH3, only NEPH2/mKirre was strongly expressed in PCNs. Expression of NEPH2/mKirre was detected from E13.5 when PCNs migrate tangentially. The expression level became weaker at P1, when PCNs stop the radial migration, raising the possibility that NEPH2/mKirre might be involved in the migration of PCNs. We are currently analyzing the function of NEPH2/mKirre in the migration of PCNs.",

Double-labeling of the centrosome and the whole-cell images by transfecting Centrin2-GFP and RFP enabled us to record dynamic movement of the centrosome during radial migration.

Among various drugs, we found that a protein kinase inhibitor, K252a has the most interesting effect on the lot cell migration. During the normal migration, leading processes and cell bodies of lot cells move forward in a coordinated manner, but K252a blocks the migratory movement of cell bodies without inhibiting the extension of leading processes. We also found that K252a has a similar effect on cerebellar granule cells.

Richmond, VA, USA Neural network develops through regulated guidance of axons and interconnection among them. Despite intensive researches in the past years, genetic mechanisms of axonal development still remain unclear. We have identified the Drosophila homolog of unc51, which encodes a Ser/Thr kinase and is required for axonal formation in C. elegans and mouse. We found that UNC51 is essential for neural development in Drosophila. Loss of function of Drosophila unc51 results in reduced locomotion and axonal transport defects reminiscent of the phenotypes observed in kinesin mutants. We also found that unc51 genetically interacts with Unc-76, an evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic protein that binds to Kinesin Heavy Chain. In unc51 mutants, UNC-76 was separated from Synaptotagmin vesicles. These results suggest that UNC51 coordinates kinesin-cargo interaction via UNC-76 to regulate dynamic axonal transport.",

Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan; 2 Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan Axons and dendrites of neurons differ in the polarity of their microtubules. The mechanism for the difference, however, is not well understood. We found previously that dendrites convert into axons in cultured neurons isolated from rat cerebral cortex. In this study, we examined whether microtubule polarity changes during the conversion. In dendrites of neurons before culture, microtubule polarity was nonuniform. After 24 h of culture, we found that most of microtubules in the original dendrites had their plus ends oriented distal. This indicates that microtubules with their minus-ends distal disappeared during the culture. Microtubule movement along actin filaments is a candidate for this mechanism among several types of microtubule movement reported in neuronal processes so far. However, the change of microtubule polarity within dendrites was observed even in the presence of actin polymerization inhibitors. Our results suggest a rearrangement of microtubules by a yet-unreported movement in neuronal processes.",

Med., Japan Rac1 is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, and assumed to be involved in regulation of neuronal development through actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Nevertheless, physiological role of Rac1 in the CNS is poorly understood because of the embryonic lethality of Rac1 knockout mice. In this study, we generated and analyzed region-specific Rac1-deficient mice (Emx1-Rac1 KO mice) by the Cre-loxP system, in which a promoter for Emx1 homeobox gene induces expression of Cre recombinase exclusively in the dorsal telencephalon, including cerebral cortex, hippocampus and olfactory bulb. Emx1-Rac1 KO mice showed partially abnormal layering of cerebral cortex, indicating impaired migration of neuronal cells during cortical development. Furthermore, Emx1-Rac1 KO mice lacked corpus callosum and anterior commissure, both of which connect the left and right cerebral hemispheres. These results suggest that Rac1 regulates neuronal cell migration and axonal growth in cerebral cortex. Previously we reported overexpression of MAP1B containing Nterminal 126 amino acids promoted neuronal death. To reveal the mechanism of MAP1B N-terminal induced neuronal death, we searched for the proteins that interact with N-terminal of MAP1B by two-hybrid system. Alpha-tubulin was found to interact with MAP1B N-terminal and their in vitro interaction was proved with pull-down assay. The interaction of tubulin and MAP1B N-terminal has not yet been reported. Beta-tubulin was also found to interact with MAP1B N-terminal. When \u2424 tubulin was divided in 2 fragment at between amino acid 213 and 214, there was no interaction between \u2424 tubulin fragments and MAP1B N-terminal. Interaction needs the continuous region over aa 213 and 214. There were much proportion of round formed COS7 cells in N-terminal containing MAP1B transfected cells than in N-terminal lacking MAP1B transfected cells. There might be some interference in interaction between MAP1B and tubulin in cells express MAP1B containing N-terminal.",

It was demonstrated that PM and G treatments, similar to E2, caused a significant decrease in the expression of pERK1/2 levels in both nerve crush and transection injuries. However, transected nerves showed high and sustained levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Following treatments, levels of S-100 were significantly decreased both in crushed and transected nerves with respect to control group at p < 0.05. This estrogenic effect was blocked by ICI182,780.

There is, however, no suitable probe for long-term neural recording and stimulation. One main reason is the death of brain tissues damaged by the probe insertion and implantation. Thus, a new skeleton-like multichannel flexible neural probe coated with hybrid biodegradable polymer was fabricated. The skeleton-like probe was designed to minimize the volume of the flexible probe and buffer injurious micromotion between the probe and the tissues in a post-implantation. The probe was coated with mixed polyethylene glycol and microspheres with nerve growth factor (NGF) to improve the stiffness for the probe insertion, and deliver NGF for an optimal period to promote regrowth of damaged neural tissues around the probe. Damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase (DINE) is a newly identified nerve regeneration-associated molecule. It encodes neuronspecific membrane-spanning metalloprotease and belongs to NEP/ECE family which degrades/processes neuropeptides. Although the precise mechanism of DINE including substrate is still unclear, DINE seems to play a protective role in damaged neurons. The most marked property of DINE is a striking response to various kinds of nerve injury in both central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. To clarify the transcriptional regulation of DINE after nerve injury, we analyzed 5 untranslated region of DINE gene. Previously, we found that LIF treatment and NGF deprivation additively increased DINE mRNA. In this study, promoter analysis showed that DINE promoter activity was cooperatively up-regulated by ATF-3 and Stat3, which were induced after nerve injury and activated at the downstream of LIF treatment and NGF deprivation. This combination of transcription factors may be pivotal to promote gene expression, which is responsible for nerve regeneration.",

Recently, in our laboratory human umbilical cord blood neural stem cell line (HUCB NSC) was established. The aim of the study was to analyze the migratory potential of HUCB NSC transplanted into intact rat brain. HUCB NSC transfected with GFP gene was stereotactically transplanted (tx) into intact brain of CsA immunosuppressed adult Wistar rats. Cell detection was performed 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 7 days after transplantation using Abs anti GFP, HLA class I and NuMa. Analysis of rat brains revealed viable GFP positive HUCB NSC cells migrating from tx site and dispersed through the host brain tissue 1, 2, 3 and 7 days after grafting. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed that these cells were of human origin: HLA class I or NuMa. In future we plan to study their lesion directed migratory potential.

The upregulation of EXT2 mRNA was detected using in situ hybridization in injured hypoglossal motoneurons, and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan was also upregulated in the injured hypoglossal nucleus. We also examined the expression of mRNA for HSPG core protein. The mRNAs for glypican-1 and syndecan-1 were upregulated in injured motoneurons.

DHA increased the number of Tuj1(+) neurons compared with the control, and the newborn neurons in the DHA group were morphologically more mature than in the control. DHA decreased the incorporation ratio of BrdU, the mitotic division marker, during the first 24 h period. Thus, DHA promotes the differentiation of NSCs into neurons by promoting cell cycle exit. Furthermore, dietary administration of DHA significantly increased the number of BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) newborn neurons in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus in adult rats.

Cues for this motion are change in binocular disparity, change in spatial frequency and optical flow. We investigated interactions among these cues by using visual stimuli in which the cues provides opposite depth motion direction. For the stimulus without optical flow component, spatial frequency was changed continuously by presenting uncorrelated random dot patterns filtered by different band-pass filters. When binocular disparity and spatial frequency was oppositely changed, subjects perceived depth motion corresponding to the change in binocular disparity or special frequency. For the stimulus with optical flow component, a random dot pattern filtered by a band-pass filter was expanded or contracted. When binocular disparity and the other two cues were oppositely changed, subjects perceived depth motion corresponding to the change in the other two cues. When depth motion was perceived from binocular disparity, stimulus image was perceived as changing its size. When from the other cues, depth perception from binocular disparity was suppressed.",

To clarify the fundamental mechanism of this motion integration process, we psychophysically examined the influence of directional motion coherency on motion grouping. Moving dots were presented in three apertures that were aligned horizontally. Before presenting these stimuli, subjects were instructed to detect a dot moving in a direction among noise dots presented in the central aperture. The dots moving in the same as or different from the instructed direction were presented in the side apertures. The performance of the subjects was the best when the dots in the side apertures moved in the same direction as the instructed one. The performance kept high when the directional difference was up to \u00b1 10 \u2022 and declined as the difference increased. The high performance would be due to the grouping of the dots presented in the central and side apertures that have the same or similar motion direction. The underlying motion grouping mechanism was suggested to integrate motion signals that have a certain directional variation.",

This phenomenon is called structure-from-motion (SFM). The direction of the rotation is ambiguous. We investigated the influence of spatial context on the perceived direction of the rotation. Three spatially separated stimuli were horizontally aligned. Subjects reported in which direction the central random-dot SFM cylinder rotated. They perceived the same direction of rotation as the side stimuli when the side stimuli were corotating cylinders whose direction of rotation was disambiguated by binocular disparity. This effect was strong when the stimuli consisted of a small number of dots, and was attenuated as the number of dots increased. The perception was also influenced by translational motion stimuli that had front and back planes comprising oppositely moving random-dots whose depth was specified by binocular disparity. These results suggest that the neural mechanism determining the rotation direction of bistable SFM is strongly influenced by the 3D structure of surrounding stimuli defined by binocular disparity.",

This phenomenon is well known as motion aftereffect (MAE). This MAE can be perceived for 3-dimensional motion such as rotating cylinders. We found that adaptation to the rotation of a stereoscopic random-dot cylinder generate MAE like phenomenon in the same positive direction as the rotation of the adaptation stimulus (positive MAE). This positive MAE was strong when cylindrical random-dot was used as a stationary test stimulus. This aftereffect could not be perceived for uniformly distributed non-cylindrical random-dot. Although ordinary MAE declined in a few seconds, this positive MAE remained for a few minutes. This is a new phenomenon that is different from known 3dimensional MAE. This finding suggests that the visual system has a mechanism that detect 3-dimensional rotation direction specifically, and this mechanism has a property that gives a bias to the perception of stereoscopic rotation direction in an adapted direction.",

As a first attempt towards identifying the neural mechanism of crowding, we investigated perceptual crowding using a random-dot kinematogram. Human subjects were required to report the direction of moving dots within a center patch (3 deg) of a center/surround display presented 10 degrees to the left of fixation, and to ignore the dots in the surround. Motion coherence of the dots in the center patch, as well as surround size varied randomly across trials. Motion coherence of the surround was always 0 percent. For each of 11 subjects, we calculated direction discrimination thresholds (at 82% correct) at each surround size. Consistent with crowding, thresholds increased when surround size was 4.5 and 6 degrees, compared to those with no surround. Surprisingly, however, thresholds decreased when surround size was 9 and 12 degrees, relative to 6 degrees. Our results show that the spatial resolution of motion direction discrimination improves when the area we have to ignore exceeds a defined size.",

How do these neurons integrate signals from V1? In particular, does the well-known columnar organization of V1 play a role in determining the shape selectivity of higher-order neurons? To explore these questions, we devised a feed-forward hierarchical model. In our model, higherorder neurons sum the activities of V1 neurons linearly according to a neural receptive field (NRF), a weighting function defined over the cortical surface. The manner a NRF sums over multiple columns determines its shape selectivity. Since there is no physiological data regarding possible forms for NRF, we have tested simple functional prototypes, Gaussians and Gabor functions. Reponses of these model neurons are examined using non-Cartesian gratings and other stimuli, and compared to published physiological data. About 15% of model neurons exhibit responses similar to those of V2 and V4 neurons. Odd-symmetric Gabor NRFs tend to generate more of these neurons.",

Sci., Osaka Univ., Japan Frequency-domain subspace reverse correlation and 2-d spacedomain dynamic dense noise have become increasingly popular for mapping receptive fields (RF) of early visual cortical neurons. However, it is not known whether results from these methods are mutually consistent. To examine this issue, we compared an RF in the space domain measured by 2-d noise stimuli and an RF reconstructed from the response in the spatial frequency (SF) domain measured by flash grating stimuli of various orientation (OR), SF and spatial phase presented in rapid succession. We fitted these two RFs by Gabor functions, and examined the consistency of their parameters. All parameters including SF, OR, spatial phase, and size of the RF agreed well when an expansive nonlinearity is considered for each cell. The optimal SF obtained in the space domain increased over time to the same extent as that obtained in the SF domain. Therefore, responses of a simple cell can be encapsulated in a concise framework of a linear filter followed by expansive nonlinearity.",

Cluster analysis indicated that IT cells were classified into five groups based on inter-spike interval (ISI) histograms of their spontaneous firing. The first two groups showed a single peak at a long or a short ISI in ISI histograms. The other three had multiple peaks, whose positions and relative heights varied among the groups. Principal component analysis and other analyses of visual responses showed that the five groups differed in their stimulus selectivity for a predetermined set of visual stimuli. Stimulus selectivity was sharper in the single-peak groups than in the multiple-peak groups. One of the single-peak groups was modulated by natural images more strongly than the other groups.

First, we found that V1 neurons exhibited shifts of their SF tuning from high to low according to a change in stimulus size from small to large. Second, we measured stimulus-area summation curve of responses and found that a higher SF stimulus caused a reduction of the receptive field (RF) size and an increase of the surround suppression. Similar results were obtained for LGN neurons implying that the relationship between SF and area summation properties observed in V1 has its origin in LGN.

However, little is known about the relationship between the selectivity for different features. Last year, we have reported that there exist many neurons in the posterior part of IT cortex (area TEO) that are selective for both color and shape. To study the relationship between the color selectivity and shape selectivity, we tested the responses of each neuron using all combinations of the sets of colors and shapes, and conducted SVD (singular value decomposition) analysis. We found that some TEO neurons exhibited selectivities for color and shape that were independent (separable) each other, whereas in some other neurons they were not independent (nonseparable).

We examined the distribution of two markers of oxidative phosphorylation (NADH-ubiquinol oxidoreductase and cytochrome C oxidase) in the human retina at different ages. Eyeballs of donors (Age: 50-94 years) were fixed in paraformaldehyde, frozen retinal sections from macular to midperipheral regions cut and immunolabelled for NADH-ubiquinol oxidoreductase (complex I) and cytochrome C oxidase (complex IV; Molecular probe, USA). Complex I-immunoreactivity (IR) was moderately present in photoreceptors, outer plexiform layer and few ganglion cells from 50 to 80 years of age, and showed a decline and lack of IR in older retinas (85-94 years). Complex IV-IR was intensely present in most ganglion cells, outer plexiform layer and photoreceptors from 50 to 91 years of age, and absent at 94 years of age. Thus, complex I and IV-IR decline with age, with the former showing an earlier reduction in its IR. The data signify a reduced mitochondrial activity in the retina with ageing.",

Activity around the CaS consisted of a prominent and a subsequent smaller but still obvious peak (117, 215 ms); the first peak showed no difference between conditions while the second peak was significantly larger in the target-present. Activity around the pFuG had a prominent peak and subsequent small activity (125, 237 ms), whereas the target's presence or not had no influence on either activity. The activity of the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) was significantly larger than that for the left IPS at latencies around 196 ms irrespective of the target's presence or not.

In order to reveal the neurophysiological substrates of this illusion, brain activities measured using magnetoenceohalography (MEG) were compared with the perceived rate of illusory jitter measured psychophysically. The result showed that the perceived rate was around 10 Hz and matched with the alpha frequency of MEG. As 10 Hz MEG responses were enhanced in the presence of illusory jitter relative to the presence of isoluminant motion and physical 10 Hz jitter, we believe that the activity is related to illusory jitter generation rather than to jitter perception or to isoluminant motion per se. These results support our hypothesis that MISC is generated within cortex by the dynamic characteristics of a cortical feedback circuit rather than by any physical stimulus properties.",

In the present study, we used Fourier analysis of flavoprotein fluorescence signals for constructing retinotopic maps in the mouse visual cortex. Periodic bar stimuli that moved across the visual fields produced periodic fluorescence signals in the visual cortex of anesthetized mice. The Fourier components of the signals locked with the periodic stimuli were calculated in each pixel regarding the magnitude and phase. Retinotopic maps were constructed based on these components. Vascular artifacts could be removed when the stimulus frequency was higher than 0.3 Hz, since fluorescence signals but not vascular responses could follow up to these frequencies.

In the present study, we designed a new prism goggle for mice. This goggle was attached on the skull of mice during the critical period. The neural responses in the visual cortex of these mice were investigated using transcranial flavoprotein fluorescence imaging. Preliminary experiments suggested that the responses in the monocular zone of the visual cortex were not affected in the strabismic mice.

Finally, by using this transformation, brain activities were sampled and then displayed as an image spanning visual field dimensions, each pixel of which represents the activity of neurons representing a given position in the visual field.

We studied effects of external pH (pH 0 ) on the control of cell functions. Photoresponses of the cells were recorded intracellularly. Slits of light stimuli simplified the estimation of the current flow in the cellular network into a one-dimensional problem. By lowering pH 0 only 0.2 units from the baseline of 7.60, we found a remarkable reduction of the conduction velocity by 20-30%, an increase of the length constant and a hyperpolarisation of the resting potential. Based on our theoretical model, combined with measurements of conduction velocity and length constants of the receptive field, we could estimate both GJ and plasmamembrane conductances of the cell. Thus, we suggest that protons could contribute to the reduction of conductances, especially at the plasmamembrane but also at GJs.",

To analyze the functional roles of ionic currents in the band-pass properties of rods, a model of the rod network was developed. The model incorporates much of the known parameters in rods, i.e., the phototransduction cascade, ionic currents (I Ca , I Kv , I K(Ca) , I h , I Cl(Ca) ), calcium system and gap junctions between rods. In simulation, the band-pass properties of the rod was analyzed. It was found that single rod itself behaves as a band-pass filter.

This analysis revealed that the pairs with correlated SAs tended to show more similar selectivity than the pairs lacking correlated SAs. In addition, model analysis showed that in 71% (12/17) of the pairs the correlation of SAs reflect synchronous transition between two activity states: periods with high and low mean firing rates.

It is often assumed that the firing rate is the sole carrier of information. However, if fine temporal patterns of spikes would carry information, the system could have large encoding efficiency. The vertebrate retinal ganglion cells fire burst spikes, separated by hundreds of milliseconds of silent periods. Here we show that temporal patterns of spikes within these bursts carry visual information. When three or more spikes are fired, the multiple interspike intervals encode the input in a cooperative, non-redundant manner. This suggests that the spike patterns are not sorely determined by slowly modulating instantaneous firing rates. We also found that millisecond-scale structures in the spike patterns encode light intensity waveforms over 200 ms. We propose that the retina compresses hundreds of milliseconds of light sequences into spike patterns at the scale of milliseconds.",

Activation within right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and right inferior parietal cortex (BA40) was significantly greater (P < 0.001, uncorrected) during rectal distention with analgesic suggestion than with neutral suggestion. On the other hand, activation within right medial frontal cortex (mPFC) was significantly greater (P < 0.001, uncorrected) during rectal distention with hyperalgesic suggestion than with neutral suggestion. This is the first evidence with PET for a modulation of cerebral processing during visceral stimulation by hypnotic suggestion. These results suggest a role of DLPFC and mPFC in the cognitive control of the interoception. The participation of bladder receptors sensitive to cold temperature has been proposed in overactive bladder for decades. Bladder cooling reflex (BCR) which consists of immediate sense of urgency and detrusor contraction in response to ice water infusion may be a neuropathic cause of detrusor overactivity (DO). Recently, urothelial cells display a number of properties similar to sensory neurons and have many sensors including gene for transient receptor potential (TRP). We detected cold sensitive receptor TRPM8 in the urothelial cell by immunofluorescence in an animal model for BOO. Intravesical administration of TRPM8 agonist (L-menthol: 0.06-6 mM) in freely moving rats, increased the micturition pressure (MP) in either normal (n = 7) or BOO rat (n = 8). The micturition interval (MI) did not change in normal rat, but decreased in BOO that have DO. The results suggest that BCR is enhanced in BOO by increasing TRPM8 on the urothelium cell of the urinary bladder.",

In teleosts, an ascending connection that corresponds to the thalamo-telencephalic pathway is present. However, it remained unclear whether or not a hypothalamo-telencephalic pathway exists in teleosts. The medial inferior lobe (mIL), which corresponds to part of the hypothalamus of other vertebrates, is known to receive general visceral sensory inputs from the rhombencephalon in a percomorph teleost Tilapia. Hence, telencephalic connections of the mIL were studied in this study. Tracer injection experiments into the mIL revealed that this hypothalamic zone projects to the preoptic area, the ventral telencephalon (i.e., Vs, Vd, and Vv), and the dorsal telencephalon (i.e., Dm, rDc, and Dl). These findings suggest that the mIL corresponds to hypothalamic relay zones in mammals (e.g. ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus).",

We have previously shown that an icv injection of anti-PrRP antibodies increases food intake. Neurones producing PrRP are activated after peripheral administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide, a satiety factor. It is thus possible that PrRP may mediate satiety signals in the brain. Here we examined effects of anti-PrRP antibodies upon total amounts of food intake and meal patterns. An icv injection of anti-PrRP antibodies increased the total amounts of food intake and amounts of food intake during a meal but did not significantly change meal frequency. These data suggest that PrRP may play an important role in the short-term control of food intake and are consistent with a hypothesis that PrRP is a satiety signal within the brain.",

Circulating concentration of leptin is in proportion to body fat mass, however, in obese humans, elevated concentrations of endogenous leptin cannot prevent the accumulation of the adipose tissue. We previously reported that leptin decreases food intake via the activation of the histaminergic system. In the present study, the effect of leptin on hypothalamic histamine release was compared in normal and high fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Leptin (1.3 mg/kg, ip) reduced food intake in normal mice but not in DIO mice, suggesting that DIO mice have resistance for exogenous leptin like obese humans. The same dose of leptin increased hypothalamic histamine release in normal mice, while it had no effect in DIO mice. These results suggest that the lack of the activation of the histaminergic system partly contributes to obesity in leptin-resistant DIO mice.",

Recent psychological studies implied that shared body representation of self and other might be required in the brain for social interaction. This means other\u00b8s body image is mapped on own body image in the same neuron. In our experiments, we studied visual-tactile receptive field of the bimodal neuron in VIP, then recorded activity during observing the experimenter being touched. Some of neurons that had receptive fields anchored on the monkey\u00b8s body showed visual response while the experimenter was being touched on corresponding body parts.

To identify related neuronal signals, we recorded single insular neurons while two monkeys worked in a reward schedule task in 2 conditions: (1) a cue is picked at random so it is uncertain whether a correctly performed trial will be rewarded [uncertain condition], (2) a cue indicates whether the current trial will be rewarded or not [certain condition]. In the uncertain condition 84/120 neurons responded in all trials. In the certain condition 50/84 neurons responded in the rewarded trials only. 48 of these 50 showed significant differences in firing rate between in the first trials after reward and other trials.

The main purpose of this study is to examine the PFC neuronal mechanism involved in predicting reward using learned associations among groups of stimuli. Monkeys performed a sequential association task with symmetric reward. At first, they learned two sequences of stimuli: A1-B1-C1 and A2-B2-C2. The asymmetric reward rule was instructed by pairing C (C1 or C2) with the reward block by block. Monkeys were also trained with two different orders of stimuli (B-C-A and C-A-B). Out of 202 neurons from the lateral PFC, 31% showed reward-related activity in the first cue period. And one third of them (SR type) predicted reward only when a preferred stimulus was presented as a first cue. Interestingly, the preference was not based on visual properties of stimulus, but on stimulus-group. The results suggest that about 10% of lateral prefrontal neurons predict reward based on stimulus-groups that were formed through the associative learning. Attention evoked by novel stimuli is important for behavioral adaptation to new environment. However, it remains unknown whether the novelty is processed in a specific region of the prefrontal cortex. We trained two monkeys on a Pavlovian conditioning task interleaved with an instrumental conditioning task and recorded cell activity from the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex (LPFC and MPFC). In a block of the Pavlovian task (Pv block), a visual stimulus (CS) was paired with a liquid reward and the trial repeated 3 times. In a following block of the instrumental task, the monkey searched a correct action to obtain the CS as positive feedback. The CS was alternated every 4 Pv blocks. In many LPFC cells, responses to the CS were enhanced immediately after the change of CS, while such enhancement was less popular in MPFC. This result suggests that LPFC more contributes to coding of stimulus-novelty than does MPFC. When an outcome of action is uncertain, a top-down attention is directed to the coming outcome. To clarify the neural mechanisms, we trained two monkeys on a task with secondary reinforcers and recorded single cell activity of the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex (MPFC and LPFC). In a Pavlovian block (Pv block), a visual stimulus was paired with a liquid reward. In a following instrumental block (Inst block), the monkey searched a correct action based on the visual feedback. The same visual stimulus as the one presented in the preceding Pv block followed a correct action, whereas another visual stimulus followed a wrong action. When the monkey made more than 3 consecutive correct trials, a new Pv block started. Both MPFC and LPFC cells gradually increased their firing toward the visual feedback when the outcome was uncertain, while the onset of the activity was significantly earlier in MPFC than in LPFC. These results suggest that the top-down attention first occurs in MPFC and propagates to LPFC in individual trials.",

The instructions activated 3 groups of putamen neurons preferring small reward-(n = 19), large reward-action (n = 3) and both types of action (n = 26). Onset latencies of these putamen neurons and RTs in large-reward-GO trials were shorter than those in small-reward-GO trials by 30-50 and 100-150 ms, respectively. Putamen neuron activation lead that of CM neurons by 50-70 ms. These results suggested that the putamen plays a major roles in both response bias and its complementary process while CM participates in the complementary process in concert with the putamen.",

Durations of both cues, order of cue duration (long-short or short-long), and order of cue color (blue-red or red-blue) were randomized on a trial-by-trial basis. Striatal neurons phasically responded during the first cue (C1), first delay (D1), second cue (C2), second delay (D2), and response periods.

Here we report that the walking direction of another individual elicits a reflexive shift of visuospatial attention in monkeys and humans. We examined how the reaction time to peripheral visual targets was affected by a prior, brief presentation of a walking biological motion (BM) stimulus. During the task, subjects responded to a target point after the disappearance of the BM stimulus and fixation point. The walking direction of the BM stimulus was not predictive of the target direction, and was irrelevant for performing the task. We found that the reaction times in congruent trials, where the walking direction of the BM stimulus and the direction of the target appearance were the same, were significantly shorter than those of incongruent trials.

Visual sensory information (e.g. stimulus features) might be integrated in PPC to form a saliency map that controls spatial attention. To examine this hypothesis, we recorded the neural activity from the lateral intraparietal (LIP) and 7a areas of monkeys performing a multidimensional visual search task. The monkeys had to make a saccade to either shape or color singletons in a stimulus array depending on the instructed search dimension. PPC neurons increased their activity when the receptive field stimulus became the target. Some neurons showed target enhancement depending on the stimulus condition (singleton type and stimulus features), whereas others exhibited it irrespective of the stimulus condition. The mixed existence of these two distinct types of activities suggests that PPC is one of critical stages that integrate feature-dependent signals to produce featureindependent signals identifying the target location toward which spatial attention should be directed. Monkeys utilize visual information in social communication. To elucidate visual function to categorize sexes, (1) performance of visually guided sex discrimination task and (2) neuronal activity during the task in orbitofrontal cortex (OBF), the region could be related to sex recognition and vision processes, were investigated. Monkeys were trained to discriminate the sex of a monkey shown in a picture that was presented on the display. The monkeys pressed the right bar for pictures of males and the left for females to get water reward. As a result, the monkeys were able to discriminate the sexes of monkeys shown in pictures. Extracellular recordings of neurons in OBF during the task showed that some cells responded to the pictures in a sexspecific manner. The present results suggest that visual information alone sufficiently contribute to discriminate sex in monkeys. OBF could be involved in visual categorization of sex.",

Dev. Neurosci., CTAAR, Tohoku Univ. Sch. Med., Sendai, Japan; 2 CREST, JST, Japan Core features of schizophrenia are impairments in certain cognitive functions such as working memory, in which a number of brain regions in the corticolimbic system are involved. Recent studies have revealed abnormality in distribution of interneurons in these regions. We have previously found that Pax6 heterozygous mutant rats show behavioral abnormalities including impairment in fearconditioned memory and sensorimotor gating. In the present study, we thus analyzed distribution of interneurons in several regions of Pax6 heterozygous mutant mouse (Sey/+) brain. We focused on three subpopulations of interneurons: parvalbumin (PV)-, calretinin-, and somatostatin-posive interneurons. Immunohistochemical studies indicated marked decrease in PV-positive interneurons in two brain regions of Sey/+ mice, i.e., the olfactory bulb and the amygdala. Reduced number of PV-positive interneurons was observed in the Sey/+ amygdala at 8 weeks, but not at 4 weeks. Our results suggest that age-dependent decrease of PV-positive interneurons might underlie behavioral abnormalities in Sey/+ mice. Schizophrenia is a complex genetic disorder, characterized by multiple susceptibility genes. Dysbindin (DTNBP1) is a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Genetic evidence for the association between the disorder and the dysbindin gene has repeatedly been reported in various populations world wide. Recently, decreased expression levels of dysbindin mRNA and protein have been reported in postmortem brain in patients with schizophrenia. Thus, we performed behavioral analysis in sandy mouse, which has a deletion in dysbindin gene and expresses no protein. Sandy mouse showed decreased locomotor activity and time in the center in the open field test. And an acute treatment of atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.), improved the decrease in time in the center. Moreover, subtle behavioral abnormality was observed in elevated plus maze test and social interaction test in sandy mouse. Our results suggest that dysbindin might be involved in anxiety-related behavior in novel environment.",

We examined the possible association between genetic variants in the dysbindin gene and memory and IQ in 165 healthy volunteers and 72 patients with schizophrenia. Individuals who did not carry a protective haplotype had lower performance in several memory domains WMS-R, although this haplotype did not affect IQ measured by WAIS-R.

The object of this study was to test that a schizophrenic cohort would show elevated AADC activity in the substantia nigra, midbrain raphe and locus coeruleus compared to normal controls. All subjects and 18 F-Dopa scans were obtained from a database of scans published in McGowan et al. 2004 , Archives General Psychiatry. The 14 schizophrenic patients all met DSM-IV criteria on medication and 10 healthy volunteers were compared. We attempted to improve the quality of the 18 F-DOPA signal by implementing a FBF-realignment movement correction method. Significant increases in 18 F-DOPA uptake were found in the striatum, substantia nigra and raphe nuclei of schizophrenic patients (p > 0.02). Our result suggests that an elevated presynaptic dopamine function is present in dopaminergic neurons that innervate striatal areas associated with enhanced dopamine activity in schizophrenia. In this study, we analyzed the P300 component of the visual eventrelated potential in 14 patients with schizophrenia and 14 healthy controls, and also performed LORETA analysis. The Ethics Committee of Kurume University approved this study. The P300 amplitude for the crying face was significantly smaller in patients than in controls. In controls, the P300 amplitude was significantly larger for the crying face than for the laughing face, while in patients, there was no significant difference in the P300 amplitude between the 2 faces. LORETA analysis demonstrated that there were significant differences in the activity in Brodmann area 10 between the 2 faces in controls, while in patients, there was no significant activity difference between the 2 faces. Stimulation with crying face induced higher activities in the 10 and right 21 areas in controls than in the patients.

In this study, we analyzed in vivo expression of pericentrin in the mouse embryo. In the developing cerebral cortex, pericentrin mRNA was highly expressed in migrating cells of the intermediate zone, though proliferating neuroepithelial cells and mature neurons revealed a low expression level of pericentrin. The pericentrin protein was shown to be localized to the base of primary cilia in the pre-plate of the developing cerebral cortex, in agreement with a recent study demonstrating the involvement of pericentrin in primary cilia formation. Specific subtypes of receptors such as 5-HT6 are known to be localized to the plasma membrane of neuronal primary cilia in certain regions of the brain, and then our results raise the possibility that pericentrin dysfunction may result in perturbed chemosensory function of neuronal primary cilia and increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. Dysregulation of GR has been thought to play an important role in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Two isoforms of human GR-alpha and -beta arise from alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA primary transcripts. Previously, we evaluated these two isoforms mRNA level in the peripheral white blood cells of the patients with mood disorders. We found that the reduced GR-alpha mRNA level in the patients with both bipolar and major depressive disorders, while GR-beta mRNA level was not altered. These results suggest that dysregulation of alternative splicing play an important role in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. To test this, we evaluated mRNA level of alternative splicing-related SR protein family, which regulate alternative splicing in several genes including GR, in the peripheral white blood cells of the patients with mood disorders. We did not find any differences in 7 of the 10 SR protein mRNAs level in the patients compared to healthy controls and now, we are examining other SR family mRNAs level.",

The present experiments examined roles of ECS in inducing LTD at a variety of corticocortical synapses in rat cortex slices by using whole-cell patch clamp. Following ECS, LTD magnitude at layer II/III-to-VI pyramidal cell synapses was significantly reduced in comparison to no-ECS subjects. As described in recent microarray studies, Homer1a/Vesl-1S was identified as one of the most up-regulated molecules after ECS. We therefore injected Homer 1a protein by diffusion from patch pipettes. Homer 1a injection, as well as with ECS treatments, reduced LTD magnitude only at layer II/III-to-VI pyramidal cell synapses, implicating that Homer 1a may be a biological mediator of ECS effects.",

By means of cDNA subtraction, we identified a candidate for EtOH-responsive genes in the hippocampus. cDNA cloning and sequence analysis revealed that this gene encodes a novel homolog of YY1AP (YY1-associated protein) and is well conserved in rats and humans. Homology search for functional domains predicted that the YARP polypeptide contains NLSs', a DNAbinding motif, and a chromatin decondensation domain, as well as YY1-binding and transactivation domains previously demonstrated in YY1AP. In the brain, neurons such as hippocampal pyramidal cells were stained by in situ hybridization, and co-expression of YARP and YY1 genes was demonstrated in the same neurons. Analogous to YY1AP as a co-activator of transcription factor YY1, it is postulated that YARP can regulate cerebral gene expression in response to EtOH treatment.",

We report here that NR2B-selective NMDA antagonists ifenprodil (3 and 10 M) and Ro25-6981 (0.1 and 1 M) markedly inhibited degeneration of orexin neurons induced by 24 h application of NMDA (45 M) or QA (1.5 mM). We also show that stimulation of GABA A receptors by muscimol (10 and 30 M) or isoguvacine (30 and 100 M) potently inhibited QA cytotoxicity. In addition, the protective effect of GABA (100 M) plus a GABA uptake blocker nipecotic acid (1 mM) was abolished by a GABA A antagonist picrotoxin (100 M). Norepinephrine and serotonin did not provide a neuroprotective effect. Thus, GABAergic inhibition may be decisive on survival of orexin neurons under excitotoxic stimuli mediated by NR2B-containing NMDA receptors.",

Bengalese finches (BF) learn highly complex songs that have grammatical structure. The underlying neural mechanisms that allow the birds to learn these songs are however not fully understood. To address this issue, we developed a neural network model of BF's songs that might explain how different regions of the brain work together. To test the model, we also conducted empirical experiments on the brains of BF. The model shows that complex grammatical songs can be replicated by simple interactions between deterministic dynamics of a recurrent neural network and random noise.

Here, we interprets that such neurons emerge as an intermediate representation to generate appropriate value and actions in reinforcement learning by simulation analysis using a model that consists of an artificial recurrent neural network trained by reinforcement learning. The simulation result suggests that the reward expectancy neurons emerge to realize smooth temporal increase of the state value by complementing the neurons that respond only in the reward trial.

The monkey searched a correct action (left or right lever press) on the basis of the two kinds of visual feedback, one (CS+) paired with a liquid reward and the other (CS\u2212) that did not appear in a preceding Pavlovian conditioning. CS+ followed a correct action and CS\u2212 followed a wrong action. When the monkey made more than 3 consecutive correct trials, a new block of Pavlovian conditioning started. We calculated the prediction errors provided by CS+ and CS\u2212 on the basis of a reinforcement learning model of action selection. We found that the neuronal activity corresponds to the prediction error of value of the selected action.

Med., Tokyo, Japan; 5 CREST, JST, Saitama, Japan Our judgment of temporal order of two sensory signals is not always fixed but subject to changes due to prior experiences, such as repeated exposure to a constant stimulus sequence. To date, such perceptual changes occurred so that signals in the order of the most frequent sequence are judged as simultaneous. In this study, we examined temporal order judgment of two tactile stimuli, delivered one to each hand, using stimulation intervals sampled from biased Gaussian distributions (mean = \u00b180 ms, s.d. = 80 ms). Previous studies predict that the point of simultaneity would be shifted toward the peak of the Gaussian, i.e. toward the most frequent interval. However, the point of simultaneity was shifted away from the peak by about 50 ms. Our results disagree with the previous studies, but conforms to a contrasting prediction from a Bayesian integration theory.",

Several experiments have shown that the property of NMDAR EPSC can change within a few weeks after birth, leading to the shortening of its decay time course. Since the calcium current through NMDAR is involved in LTP and LTD induction, it is possible that such change can work as the modulation of the plasticity rule or higher-order plasticity. Here we show by the biophysical compartmental model that the alteration of NMDAR property can modulate the calcium influx into the spine, which finally switches plasticity rule. We also show that this type of plasticity switch can promote synaptic competition and separate postnatal synapses rapidly into two groups of either strong or week ones. Our results suggest that changing NMDAR time course is very useful for the developing animals in order to promote fast and stable formation of the polysynaptic circuit.",

In the present study we investigated changes in lipid composition of membranes isolated from cerebral cortex of rats treated with thioacetamide (TAA), a hepatotoxin which induces FHF and thereon HE. Estimation of phospholipid fatty acid content in cerebral cortex membranes from TAA treated rats revealed a decrease in monounsaturated fatty acid namely oleic acid and the poly unsaturated fatty acids \u2425-linolenic acid, decosa hexanoic acid and arachidonic acid compared to controls. Assesment of membrane fluidity with pyrene, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, and 1-[4 (trimethylammonio)phenyl]-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene revealed a decrease in annular membrane fluidity while the global fluidity was unaffected. The level of thiobarbituric acid reactive species-marker for lipid peroxidation also increased in membranes from TAA treated rats indicating prevalence of oxidative stress.

Immunohistology of chick embryos revealed apical accumulation of Rho, Rac and Cdc42 in neural plate cells, especially in bending hinge points. After neural tube closure, the apical accumulation decreased. Coordinately, activities of Rho-GTPases and myosin II in neural plate cells were higher during neurulation than after neural tube closure. Inhibitions of actin filament formation, myosin II-mediated contraction or Rho-associated kinase activity affected neural tube formation. Inhibition of Rho activity induced the disruption of its apical accumulation and the defects of neural tube formation.

By using in utero electroporation, we show that Sp8 regulates anterior-posterior patterning of the cortex into areas by controlling distinct Fgfs that having opposing effects. Sp8 and Fgf8 exhibit reciprocal induction, indicating that Sp8 is a positive feedback regulator of Fgf8. Surprisingly, though, ectopic expression of both Sp8 and its dominant active form shift cortical areas in the opposite manner to Fgf8, suggesting that Sp8 activates additional targets that overcome Fgf8 function. Our results indicate that Fgf10 is an additional target of Sp8, showing effect on patterning similar to Sp8.

Accordingly, we analyzed the neuronal migration in the mutant neocortex and compared the phenotypes to the changes induced by fak gene-knock down by foreign gene transfer by means of in utero electroporation. Late-generated neocortical neurons exhibited defective radial migration in the mutant and this defect was rescued by the transfer of fyn-expression vector to the neocortical primordium.

These interactions are mediated by the specific HS structures generated by sulfation and epimerization. A recently identified extracellular sulfatase, SulfFP1, has been implicated in the regulation of growth factor/morphogen signaling through HS remodeling in vitro, but its physiological roles remain unknown. Here we generated knockout mice lacking the SulfFP1 gene, and examined the brain development. A previous study showed that the brain-specific disruption of the EXT1 gene, which encode a HS synthesizing enzyme, led to severe brain defects including hypoplasia of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. In this study, we thus examined the morphological changes of the cerebellum in the neonatal and adult SulfFP1-deficient mice. Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans play a crucial role in mediating important signaling by Wnt, Hedgehog and FGF. Recently, novel sulfatases, SulfFP1/Sulfatase-1 and SulfFP2/Sulfatase-2, which have HS 6-O-endosulfatase activity have been isolated. Since these SulfFPs are detected in the extracellular space, SulfFPs are thought to regulate cell surface signaling through HS remodeling. In order to examine the function of SulfFP genes in zebrafish, we isolated zebrafish SulfFP1 and SulfFP2. Here we report the isolation and the characterization of the third homologue, SulfFP3. SulfFP3 has about 56% and 71% overall amino acid homology with SulfFP1 and SulfFP2, respectively. At 24 h postfertilization, SulfFP3 is expressed in the ventral region of spinal cord, whereas SulfFP1 is expressed only in the floor plate and SulfFP2 is expressed in the lateral floor plate and ventral regions of spinal cord.

Teleost relay nuclei, the preglomerular complex (PG), have been assumed to originate from the basal plate (posterior tuberculum, PT) of the diencephalon, whereas relay nuclei in mammals are derived from the alar plate. Our results show, however, that many pax6-or dlx2-positive cells migrate laterally and ventrocaudally from the diencephalic alar plate to the basal plate during development. Massive clusters of the migrated alar cells become localize in the mantle layer lateral to the PT neuroepithelium, from which the PG appear to differentiate. We therefore consider most neurons in the PG are be of alar, not basal origin. Thus, the teleost PG can be regarded as migrated alar nuclei.

We previously demonstrated that misexpression of Ventroptin altered the retinotectal projection along both the DV and AP axes. Here, we show that topographic molecules along the DV axis, together with ephrinA2, are expressed in a double-gradient fashion from E6 on like Ventroptin and BMP2. When BMP2 expression is manipulated by using the gene-specific knockdown and the reagent-inducible gene expression techniques, the expression patterns of these double-gradient molecules are all changed. Moreover, in the BMP2 knockdown and ephrinA2-misexpressing embryos, the retinotectal projection is altered along the two axes. The expressional switching from BMP4 to BMP2 thus appears to play a key role in retinal patterning and consequently in topographic retinotectal projection, by changing the direction of the DV axis toward the posterior side during retinal development.",

The weight of each hemisphere was roughly equal. The M-L was wider in the right side than the left side. The A-P was longer and the width of the medial surface was larger in the left side than in the right side. Because of the longer A-P and the larger width of the medial surface in the left hemisphere, it appeared that the left hemisphere overspreads the medial-dorsal marginal surface of the right hemisphere by the naked eye.

Furthermore, using appropriate training patterns, this network exhibits a context-dependent transition, in which the network switches to multiple patterns from a single pattern depending on the temporal structure of neuronal activity at the onset of incoming spike synchrony.

To clarify this problem, nicotine was intraperitoneally injected into 4 weekold Wistar strain rats in several doses followed by successive injections of BrdU for the next 4 days. Then rats were sacrificed and vertical sections of the hippocampus formation were offered for double immunohistochemical staining of BrdU/PSA-NCAM, BrdU/NeuN or BrdU/GFAP. As the results, numbers of both BrdU(+)/PSA-NCAM(+) cells and BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) cells were much decreased nicotine-dose dependently.

The migration pattern of the eGFP-labeled neural progenitors in the cultured slices is almost same as that at the corresponding age. The expression patterns of the glial differentiation-markers were also in accordance with those at the corresponding age. When slices were cultured with anti-\u24233 integrin antibody, the migration of the neural progenitors inside SVZ was significantly enhanced along the rostrocaudal extent. These results suggest that the organotypic slice culture of postnatal rat forebrain is an efficient experimental system for pharmacological studies about migration and differentiation of neural progenitors. Radial glia is involved in the contact guidance of neuronal migration and also the neuronal and astroglial precursors. To make clearer the role of radial glia, we developed a method for the selective ablation of a subset of radial glia. It has been reported that tenascin-C (TN-C) is one of the markers for radial glia. Accordingly, diphtheria toxin (DT)gene and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-gene both driven by TN-C gene promoter were co-transferred into the ventricular zone cells of the mouse neocortical primordium by means of in utero electroporation. The numbers of EGFP-labeled cells in that TN-C gene promoter and subsequently DT gene are activated selectively decreased by this approach.

Rspo2 is expressed in the developing medial cerebral wall and transgenic mice expressing Rspo2 in the entire neuroepithelium show enlarged lateral ventricle with a slight increase of brain size (Hatanaka et al. 2005) . Since Wnt3a has a role for expansion of caudomedial cortical progenitor cells (Lee et al. 2000) , these findings lead us to the idea that Rspo2 may synergistically promote proliferation of cortical neuroepithlial cells together with Wnt3a. To clarify their role on proliferation of cortical neuroepithelial cells, we first introduced a \u2424-catenin/TCF reporter gene into these cells of embryonic day 11.5 mouse. An application of Wnt3a on these cells increased level of the reporter expression, and an addition of Rspo2 further increased its level.

We analyzed structure and gene expression of cell spheres formed under various culture conditions, in order to elucidate mechanisms of the uni-directional differentiation into neurons. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the neuronal differentiation did not occur in the cell spheres. These results suggest that astrocyte-derived factor and cell-cell communication are necessary for the differentiation. We have previously established ES cell differentiation system, by which we can derive neurospheres containing neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) with the identity of early caudal neural tube. Taking advantage of this culture system, we have recently found conditioned medium of a stromal cell line (CMSC) has the activity to support the formation of neurospheres. This activity was more prominent when cultured at low cell density than when cultured at high cell density, suggesting that it supports the survival of NS/PCs. Moreover, RT-PCR analysis of regional identities of the CMSC treated neurospheres revealed elevated expression of pax3 and pax7 compared with those of untreated neurospheres, indicating that CMSC promotes dorsalization of NS/PCs or selective proliferation of dorsal NS/PCs. Elucidation of underlying mechanisms may provide important tools to derive early NS/PCs which can generate variety of projection neurons and be applicable to regenerative medicine.",

FABP7 expression was also overlapped with Pax6, and expression of FABP7 was down-regulated in the DG of Pax6 deficient rats and mice. Finally, BrdU-labeling analysis revealed decreased cell proliferation in the DG of FABP7 knockout mice. Taking all together, it is concluded that FABP7 is required for maintenance of neural stem/progenitor cells in DG.",

Staining of vascular endothelial cells by FITCtomato lectin and immunohistochemical staining of the surrounding cells were performed on the same cryostat sections of embryos of embryonic day 4-7. Sections were examined under a confocal laser scanning microscope. Capillaries were found in the lateral pallium and seemed to grow from PSA-NCAM-positive outer zone to negative inner zone of the pallium. PSA-NCAM is thought to be expressed in the immature neurons. The rims of capillaries were immunoreactive with PSA-NCAM in both zones. Immunoreaction of doublecortin (neuronal marker) and punctate immunostaining of laminin also were observed on rims of capillaries. By immuno-electron-microscopy it appeared that the endothelium were covered with very thin processes of cells of which outer surface was immunoreactive with PSA-NCAM.

To investigate the pattern of lamin expression during neuronal differentiation, we immunohistochemically analyzed the existence of lamins in two neurogenic regions of rat brain; subgranular zone of dentate gyrus and subventricular zone, with confocal microscopy. GFAP-positive primary progenitor cells possess lamin A/C (++), B1 (++), B2 (++), PSA-NCAM-positive subsequent progenitor cells possess lamin A/C (\u2212), B1 (+++), B2 (+), and mature neurons possess lamin A/C (++), B1 (+), B2 (+++), in both neurogenic regions.

It has been unclear, however, how do adult progenitor cells sense activity signals from surrounding neural circuit. In the hippocampus where new neurons are continuously produced throughout life, nestin + adult progenitor cells received GABAergic inputs. The GABAergic activity depolarized these progenitor cells, and then promoted their neuronal differentiations. Although neuronal production does not readily occur in the adult neocortex, nestin + neural progenitor cells exist in this area too. Interestingly, these progenitor cells also received excitatory GABAergic inputs. This GABAergic inputs inhibited their cell proliferations. From these results, we here propose that adult progenitor cells are a direct target of GABAergic neuronal networks, and that this networkto-progenitor cell interaction influences progenitors development by regulating their cell proliferations and/or neuronal differentiations.",

However, the questions remain how astrocytic progenitors divide and differentiate into neurons, and how the neuroblasts migrate to the GCL. To observe them, we developed a time-lapse imaging system. Retrovirus-GFP was injected into the rat hippocampus at P5. Three days after the injection, the hippocampal slices were prepared for the time-lapse imaging. The present data show that neuroblasts migrate from the hilus to the GCL, changing the direction of their movement.

We further show here that cholecystokinin (CCK) mRNA is expressed in a subset of excitatory neurons in layer 6. By double ISH, layer 6 neurons in monkeys are roughly divisible into CCK(+) and Sema3E(+) subgroups. Each subgroup was further subdivided by other markers. Tracer experiments showed that CCK and Sema3E mRNA expression correlate well with corticocortical and corticothalamic connectivity, respectively, but the correlation was only partial.

To examine involvement of Notch-RBP-J signaling in the cortex laminar formation, we deleted RBP-J from neural progenitors in anatomically restricted areas by in vivo electroporation of Cre-expressing plasmids. Such studies revealed that RBP-J deficiency caused transformation of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in layer II/III to layer IV neurons with concomitant loss of astrocytes. The loss of RBP-J accelerated neuronal differentiation and changed their laminar fates. In addition, time-lapse studies indicated the migration defect of RBP-J-deficient neurons.

We found that fast-spiking (FS) interneurons sent GABAergic inhibitory input to cholinergic interneurons, which were GABA A receptor-mediated and suppressed by GABA B receptor agonist SKF97541. In turn, cholinergic interneurons sent cholinergic excitatory input to FS interneurons. Because the excitatory postsypnatic potentials (PSPs) were blocked by hexamethonium and dihydro-\u2424-erythroidine, the PSPs were nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated.

The result indicates that the visual region where the gain of the visuomotor transmission increased is not limited to a small region near the target but spreads to a larger field. In other words, the anticipation of upcoming SPEMs could affect the generation of OFRs. Furthermore, directionally biased ocular responses to the brief background motion were observed when the animals repeatedly performed SPEMs toward one direction, implying that the prediction of the upcoming SPEM direction might cause the directional asymmetry of the visuomotor transmission gain.",

However, the majority of floccular Purkinje (P-) cells discharged after onset of vergence-pursuit. Cerebellar dorsal vermis is another cerebellar area for frontal pursuit.

Of a total of 77 P-cells that were examined during both frontal and vergence-pursuit, 46% discharged for both, 40% only for vergence, and 14% only for frontal pursuit.

Majority (70%) of these P-cells discharged before onset of vergence eye movements with the typical lead time of 50 ms, suggesting their involvement in the initiation of vergence-pursuit.",

Mustari Division of Sensory-Motor Systems, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta GA, USA The frontal eye field (FEF) cortex is known to play a role in smooth pursuit (SP). This role is supported by FEF projections to the rostral nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (rNRTP) which projects heavily to the vermis. Using multiple linear-regression modeling, we have shown that SP neurons in rNRTP were biased towards eye acceleration. However, the functional characteristics of SP related FEF neurons that project to rNRTP have never been described. Therefore, we used micro-electrical stimulation to deliver single pulses in rNRTP to antidromically activate FEF neurons. The majority of SP related FEF neurons that we identified as projecting to rNRTP were most sensitive to eye acceleration and much less sensitive to eye velocity. The neurons in FEF-rNRTP pathway carry signals that could play a primary role in SP initiation. Our antidromic studies may help address a fundamental question regarding whether basilar pontine nuclei integrate signals from multiple cortical areas or mostly relay signals with little transformation to cerebellum.",

To understand the role of the MST in optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) and afternystagmus (OKAN), we examined the effects of bilateral chemical lesions in the MST in two monkeys. When each monkey was injected with ibotenic acid (15 mg/ml, 36-37 l total), the initial rapid rise in OKN was reduced. Consequently, it took longer for the eye velocity to reach a steady state (i.e., an eye velocity close to the stimulus velocity). By contrast, the steady state OKN was not affected and the OKAN persisted. The initial amplitude and falling time constant of the OKAN increased. The results suggest that the MST is part of the direct pathway for the initial rapid rise in the OKN, but is not involved in the velocity storage mechanism for the steady state OKN and OKAN. Smooth pursuit is performed by coordination of eye and head movements. We have reported that the majority of FEF pursuit neurons in monkeys with their head free to rotate about a vertical axis were modulated not only during eye-and gaze-pursuit but also head-pursuit to a moving reward feeder while the monkeys fixated an earth-stationary spot without gaze movement. To examine the origin of head-pursuit modulation, we moved the reward feeder in a ramp trajectory at 20 \u2022 /s with random intervals. The majority of pursuit neurons discharged before the onset of head movements with the mean lead time of 58 ms. Discharge modulation during head-pursuit and passive whole body rotation was not correlated in most neurons. These results suggest that proprioceptive neck inputs or vestibular inputs are not the main origin of head-pursuit modulation. Rather, our results suggest that the main origin reflects pursuit commands.",

Our data demonstrate that electrical stimulation of the PDB evokes saccades and they always terminate before the end of the stimulus train.

The MFR exhibits similar features to the ocular following response (OFR) elicited by the similar visual stimulus, with respect to the stimulus-response directional characteristics and the spatiotemporal frequency tuning property. This suggests that computational mechanism is shared for both responses. However, the neural basis of the MFR motor command generation remains unclear, while OFR is known to be generated subcortically. Here we show, by using transcranial magnetic (TMS) and electrical (TES) stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M1), that (1) an EMG response evoked by TMS was facilitated during MFR, while that by TES was not, and (2) intracortical inhibition within M1 assessed by paired-pulses TMS was reduced during MFR. These results suggest that MFR is generated through activity of interneuronal networks within M1. Such cortical mechanisms for MFR generation are distinct from the subcortical processes for OFR generation.",

However, the computational mechanism to generate quick adjustment is still unclear. Here we investigated this mechanism from the viewpoint of visuomotor coordinate transformation. We observed the hand responses to the target shifts in 8 radial directions applied during reaching. The data show that the direction of the initial phase (150-200 ms) of hand response acceleration was slightly biased from the corresponding target shift direction, whereas the direction of the late phase (250-300 ms) was little biased. Additionally, when we use a target shift having less-motion energy, the response latency greatly increased and the directional bias significantly decreased. These results suggest that the on-line reaching adjustment would be generated by two different mechanisms: a reflexive controller which is induced by visual motion with short latency and generates spatially inaccurate response, and voluntary controller which generates spatially accurate response with long latency.",

The checker pattern suddenly moved either rightward or leftward brief after reaching start. In the second condition, subjects did the same task with watching the lower marker.

The result was consistent even when the position of the fixation point was changed. The above tendency was considered to occur in eye-or gaze-centered coordinates.

To answer this question, we investigated the dependency of the endpoint errors on the positions of a monitor and the fixation point. The subjects, sitting in front of the monitor, were asked to point a remembered target as accurately as possible using a computer mouse.

These asymmetrical convergence may reflect asymmetries of central control of convergence eye movement. The lateral suprasylvian (LS) areas are extrastriate cortices which receive visual information from V1. The LS has contralateral dominant receptive fields and convergence eye movements evoked from the long latency regions were asymmetrical. Cats (n = 7) were trained to start convergence by an alarm signal (buzzer sound or combination of buzz and blinking of LED), preceding target movement by 4 s. After training, ocular convergence was elicited by the alarm signal before target movement (predictive open-loop convergence) in 60% of trials.

Reward was delivered during or after target-hold period. We found that many SEF cells became active during the period of reward delivery (R-cell).

Here we show that the loss of IMPase causes defects in behavior and localization of synapses in C. elegans. Mutations in ttx-7 gene encoding IMPase exhibit defective thermotaxis behavior, which is attributable to the loss of IMPase activity in the most essential integrative interneuron RIA in the nervous system. The ttx-7 mutations also cause mislocalization of synaptic proteins in RIA. Both behavioral and synaptic defects in ttx-7 mutants were rescued by expression of IMPase at adult stage and Inositol application, and were mimicked by Lithium application in wild type animals. These results suggest that IMPase is required in the mature nervous system for maintaining synapses of the central interneurons in order for animals to behave properly.",

Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT) have been used as the best histological markers to identify glutamatergic neurons. We here studied expressions of two VGLUT isoforms (VGLUT1 and -2) during rat OB development from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P10 by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. At P1 VGLUT1 immunoreactivity (IR) was detected in all layers except the olfactory nerve layer, and thereafter its localization expanded and intensity increased. VGLUT1 mRNA signals were detectable in the mitral cell layer from P1 to P10. In contrast, VGLUT2 IR was prominent in the glomerulus at all days examined, and only at P1 and P3 in mitral cells. Despite mitral VGLUT2 IR disappeared at P10, the mRNA signals were still detectable. These results suggest that glutametergic neurons in the rat OB continue to develop even after birth.",

These V1Rs were not expressed in the VNO, but most of them were expressed in the OE of the middle cavity, which is considered for reception of water-soluble odorants.

Using multichannel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we examined the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) of healthy volunteers (N = 10) while they tasted and encoded the quaternary taste mixtures. The contrast between the cortical activation under encoding conditions and that under control conditions without memory requirement revealed activation in the bilateral ventro-LPFC and the right posterior portion of the LPFC. The activation pattern, which was in line with those that have been associated with intentional encoding of non-verbal materials of other senses, supported an amodal role of LPFC in intentional encoding, at least at a macro structural level. This study also demonstrates that, by using fNIRS, LPFC functions on taste can be examined with experimental paradigms comparable to those used for other senses. Recently, we performed simultaneous respiration and electroencephalographic recordings during odor stimulation. We sought to identify changes in respiratory pattern, inspiratory phase-locked alpha oscillation (I-\u2423) and location of dipoles estimated from the potentials. Electroencephalographic dipole tracing identified the location of dipoles from the I-\u2423 in the limbic area and the cortex; the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, premotor area and orbitofrontal cortex. In this study, we compared the respiratory pattern during odor stimulations, I-\u2423, dipole localizations without habituation with those with habituation of odors. Onset of inspiration was used as a trigger for averaging, and potentials were averaged before and after the habituation period. Habituation of odor caused to return to the normal respiratory pattern, decrease of amplitudes of \u2423, and entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala were less active.",

Replacement of the OR coding regions in the BAC transgene with reporter genes allowed the reporters to be expressed in a small population of OSNs in the transgenic fish. In situ hybridization analysis using OR-specific probes revealed that OR genes expressed in reporter-positive cells were mostly restricted within the same OR subfamilies to which the replaced ORs belonged. Additionally, the reporter-expressing OSNs projected their axons to a topographically fixed cluster of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb.

However cellular mechanisms underlying the integration of multimodality are poorly understood yet. In this study, we examined single-unit spike responses of insular cortical neurons to odor stimulation and intraoral water stimulation in urethane-anesthetized rat. We found that more than 25% of recorded neurons in the insular cortex responded to odors. About half of the odor-responsive neurons were activated by intraoral water stimulation, indicating the convergence of olfactory and oral sensory information onto individual neurons in the insular cortex. When odor stimulation and intraoral water stimulation were simultaneously applied, some neurons showed spike responses larger than the responses evoked by each stimulus. The integration of olfactory and oral sensory information in the insular cortex might contribute to form the flavor sensation.",

However, the manner of integration at the level of individual cortical neurons is not well understood yet. Using single-unit recording method, we examined the response selectivity of individual neurons in a dorsocaudal part of the anterior piriform cortex (aPC) to 8 classes of odorous compounds, each class being present in odors from many different vegetables and fruits. Individual neurons typically responded to more than 2 classes of odorants. Each neuron was uniquely tuned to a specific combination of odorant classes, and different neurons typically showed different odor combination selectivity. Single-unit responses to odor mixtures showed mixture facilitation and mixture suppression. These results suggest that individual neurons in the aPC can be characterized by the odor combination selectivity and that the aPC neurons may integrate signals from different odorant classes.",

This plasticity, called early adaptation, requires AIY interneurons, which receive synaptic inputs from olfactory neurons, indicating that early adaptation depends on neural circuit. The Ras-MAPK pathway is activated by odorant exposure in AIY and plays essential roles for early adaptation. The function of GLR-1, a non-NMDA type glutamate receptor, in AIY is also important for early adaptation. GLR-1 appears to localize at postsynaptic sites in AIY. This localization was changed by odorant exposure in early adaptation. Mutation of the Ras-MAPK pathway impaired localization of GLR-1. in vitro kinase analyses revealed the possibility that MAPK directly phosphorylates GLR-1.

In rodents, some strains prefer NaCl solutions (\u223c1%), but others do not or even avoid them. Although it is reported that the difference is based on the genetic background, the molecular information involved in the difference is not known. In the 26th NS annual meeting, we have shown that NaCl preference in several wild-type strains of Drosophila melanogaster is variable and P-element insertion in a single gene suppressed NaCl preference. Here, we carried out the sequencing analysis and found eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene. Moreover, we found that one of the SNPs was correlated with NaCl preference among wild-type strains. We generated transgenic flies and rescued the low preference phenotype of P-element insertion strain using the GAL4/UAS system. Finally, we examined the expression pattern of the gene and found the gene is expressed in taste organs. Taken together, we suggest that the gene is a novel NaCl receptor gene.",

Single unit recordings from mitral/tufted cells in the mouse olfactory bulb (OB) showed that some neurons continued to discharge for more than 10 s even after the cessation of odorant stimulation. The induction of the sustained spike discharge depended on the intensity of odorant stimulation, and showed an allor-none behavior. Spike discharges during the sustained discharge mode phase-locked to the respiration cycle and the phase-locking pattern during the sustained discharge mode differed from that during odor stimulation. These results suggest that neuronal mechanism in the OB may be responsible for the induction of the post-stimulus sustained discharges.

After REM sleep deprivation the activity increased, while the level of phosphorylated form of Na-K ATPase decreased in the same sample.

Schl. of Med., Ehime, Japan Muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) is critical for the synaptic clustering of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR). MuSK is activated by agrin, which is released from motoneurons, and induces AChR clustering at the postsynaptic membrane. Although autoantibodies against the ectodomain of MuSK have been found in a proportion of patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (MG), it is unclear whether MuSK autoantibodies are the causative agent of generalized MG. In the present study, rabbits immunized with MuSK ectodomain protein manifested MG-like muscle weakness with a reduction of AChR clustering at the NMJ. The autoantibodies activated MuSK and blocked AChR clustering induced by agrin or by mediators that do not activate MuSK. Thus, MuSK autoantibodies rigorously inhibit AChR clustering mediated by multiple pathways, an outcome that broadens our general comprehension of the pathogenesis of MG. (Shigemoto et al., J.

The proteolytic activity and protein expression of CD in the mutant mice were approximately 30% of those in the wild-type mice, while the growth of the mice appeared intact until postnatal day 24. The mice started to show NCL symptoms on P25, and their life span was prolonged for one to three days, compared to that of the CD-null mice.

In this report, we compared the toxicity of polyQ among cells expressing polyQ tracts with a variety of intracellular distribution but at similar expression levels. Damages were most remarkable in cells with cytoplasmic massive aggregate in terms of shrunken cellular and nuclear sizes. Cells with cytoplasmic homogeneous distribution, cytoplasmic punctate distribution and intranuclear inclusion of polyQ tracts were relatively spared.

Due to a deficiency of lysosomal \u2424-galactosidase, excessive lysosomal accumulation of GM1 is observed in patients and animal model brains. However pathogenesisi of this disease is still unclear. Since GM1 is known to be a major sialoglycolipid constituent of plasma membrane (PM) in neuron, we examined the analysis of brain of mouse model. Cerebellar granule cells from this mouse showed GM1 accumulation of lysosome and PM and the membrane fluidity was also reduced. GM1-bound phosphorylated TrkA was markedly decreased in cultured neuron and brain tissues. Subsequent PLC\u2425, known as a downstream signal of TrkA, was also impaired.

Learning is a necessary condition in many experimental models aimed at assessing the rewarding value of a given stimulus. Conversely, reward is often used as an experimental tool to engage mnemonic processes in studies aimed at investigating learning and memory. Recent studies have demonstrated shared neurobiology between memory and reward. A direct behavioral interaction between reward and memory has never been studied. Cognitive impairments observed in psychiatric conditions of dysregulated reward, such as drug abuse and depression, make this issue important, particularly in light of ongoing efforts to investigate higher brain functions. We are developing a rodent behavioral model with which to directly assess the influence of reward processes on learning and memory. We will introduce our recent progress with this new model, including two variations of the procedure designed to study the influence of reward on memory acquisition and memory recall.",

Ts1Cje, a DS mouse model partially trisomic for chromosome 16, shows learning and behavioral abnormalities mimicking DS mental retardation. The trisomic segment, corresponding to parts of human chromosome 21q22, has about 97 genes. Importantly, SOD1 and APP, which may contribute to the DS phenotype, are excluded from the Ts1Cje trisomic segment. Here we report that Ts1Cje brains show hyperphosphorylation of tau in the absence of NFT formation, as well as increased Gsk3\u2424 and Jnk/Sapk activities without alterations in A\u2424PP metabolism. Our results suggest that genes on the trisomic Ts1Cje segment other than APP and SOD1 can cause hyperphosphorylation of tau, which in turn may be critical in the pathogenesis of DS mental retardation.",

Since these mice show learning and behavioral abnormalities mimicking DS mental retardation, Ts1Cjespecific trisomic segment genes may be involved in the DS phenotype. In the present study, we observed increased levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), mitochondrial function impairment in primary cultured astrocytes and hippocampal neurons, and increased cabonylated proteins in Ts1Cje brains.

To model the polyglutamine expansion disease, Huntington Disease (HD), we have established stable, inducible cell lines expressing N-terminal truncated huntingtin fused to EGFP with an expanded (62Q) polyglutamine repeat in a Drosophila larval central nervous system-derived cell line. Induction of expression results in the formation of protein aggregates, characteristic of HD. Utilising RNAi, we have carried out a high-throughput screen for modifiers of aggregate formation in these cells. 7200 genes, encompassing around 50% of the Drosophila genome, were screened, resulting in the identification of 370 candidates that either suppress or enhance aggregation. Most candidates identified have mammalian orthologues, validating the use of Drosophila to screen for genes relevant to human disease. We established in vivo models of HD by expressing polyQ-EGFP in the Drosophila nervous system and are further characterising selected candidates in our model. The rodent model of harmaline-induced tremor has been used as an animal model of essential tremor. The present study investigated effects of harmaline on olivocerebellar systems of mice and rats. Systemic administration of harmaline produced generalized tremors in both types of rodents. Immunohistochemical studies revealed significant degeneration of Purkinje cells that was associated with activated microgliosis in the cerebellar cortex, following administration of harmaline in rats but not in mice. However, in mice but not rats, microgliosis was induced following administration of harmaline in the inferior olivary nucleus (ION). Numbers of neurons in the mouse ION did not decrease, suggesting the possibility that microgliosis in ION might not be a simple neurotoxic effect. Presumably, differences in sensitivity of Purkinje cells between rats and mice may be related to differences in functional alterations in their respective olivocerebellar systems induced by harmaline. Recognition of these species-specific differences is an important consideration for experimental analysis of the rodent model of tremors.",

We have identified \u24244 as an EST that was significantly downregulated in the striatum of HD model mice and found that reduction in \u24244 started at a presymptomatic stage of the HD model mice. In contrast, spinal cord neurons, which generate only negligible levels of expanded polyQ aggregates, maintained normal levels of \u24244 expression even at the symptomatic stage. Expanded polyQ with NLS expression suppressed the promoter activity of \u24244 gene in PC12 cells. Forskolin, an activator of the cAMP/PKA pathway, did not affect b4 promoter activity, indicating that \u24244 is not cAMP-responsive gene.

For the adequate experimental design and interpretation of data, it is essential to know experimental variables which may potentially influence results, and various kinds of factors which underlie many indices measured in the tests. In this study, we investigated the effects of background strains (C57BL/6J, C57BL/6N, C57BL/6C, 129SvEv, BALB/c), body weight, age at test, and start time of test on the results of each test, by analyzing data of more than 1200 mice (, including wild type and mutant mice from 25 strains of genetically engineered mice), which had been tested in our laboratory. Also, we conducted factor analyses of a large set of data to examine the relationship between behavioral indices. The potential implications of our findings for the improvement of the behavioral test battery will be discussed. Calcium-and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) is a protein kinase that activates the transcription factor, cAMP responseelement binding protein (CREB). CaMKIV has been hypothesized to play a significant role in synaptic plasticity and in learning and memory. However, functions of CaMKIV in a variety of behaviors, e.g., motor function, nociception, fear, anxiety, depression, learning and so on, have not yet been fully elucidated. To gain more insight into behavioral significance of CaMKIV, we subjected CaMKIV\u2212/\u2212 mice to a battery of behavioral tests. CaMKIV\u2212/\u2212 mice did not display any deficit in spatial reference memory and working memory tests, but had mild performance deficit in fear conditioning tests. These results indicated selective and specific involvement of CaMKIV in regulating emotional behavior.",

RyR3 is highly expressed in the hippocampus, caudate putamen, and thalamus. To investigate the behavioral effects of RyR3 deficiency, we subjected RyR3 knockoout mice to a battery of behavioral tests. RyR3 knockout mice exhibited hyperactivity and abnormal behavior in social interaction test, while they did not show any deficit in motor function, depression, attention, and working memory tests.

In neurons, NO is produced by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), representing one of three NOS isoforms expressed in most tissues. To elucidate function of nNOS/NO in a variety of behaviors, e.g., activity, motor function, nociception, attention, anxiety, depression, social interaction, learning and so on, we subjected nNOS knockout mice to a battery of behavioral tests. nNOS knockout mice exhibited increased locomotor activity and decreased depressionrelated behavior.

Sch. Human and Environmental Std, Kyoto Univ., Kyoto, Japan; 2 Primate Res. Inst., Kyoto Univ., Inuyama, Japan ADHD is one of the prevalent childhood psychiatric disorders. Children with ADHD show hyperactive behavior and attention problems, suggesting prefrontal (PFC) contribution to ADHD. ADHD is also known as dopamine (DA) related dysfunctions, because methylphenidate is the most effective drug for the treatment of ADHD. PFC is the cortical area where the strongest DA innervation is observed. Injection of DA-related drugs to PFC produces behavioral deficits in cognitive tasks. These suggest that DA-related dysfunction in PFC could be a candidate of biological causes of ADHD. To prove this notion, we injected 6-OHDA into bilateral PFC to destroy DA innervation in infant monkeys and examined whether these monkeys exhibited hyperactivity. 6-OHDA injected monkeys showed significant increase of spontaneous activity in test cages. Oral administration of methylphenidate reduced spontaneous activity in 6-OHDA injected monkeys. These results suggest that monkeys injected 6-OHDA into PFC are good candidates of the primate model of ADHD.",

Interestingly, in the conditional Atg7-knock-out mice where autophagy is absent specifically in the liver, numerous ubiquitinated aggregates are detected in the cytosol of hepatocytes (Komatsu et al., 2005) , suggesting that protein ubiquitination may serve as a signal to the autophagic process. We therefore examined the immunohisto/cytochemical localization of ubiquitin and LC3, and found that in our NCL model mice, positive signals for ubiquitin and LC3 were co-localized on the membranes of granular structures in the neuronal perikarya.

However, receptors mediating such activation are not clearly specified, though several studies indicate the increase of extracellular acetylcholine, dopamine, and glutamate in the mPFC. Here, we examined effects of local application of those antagonists on increased firing activity of mPFC neurons by systemic PCP in anesthetized rats. After tonic activation of mPFC neurons by PCP had been established, CNQX, SCH23390, mecamylamine or scopolamine was locally applied with iontophoresis or gas pressure on the recorded neuron. CNQX reduced PCP-induced augmentation of firing activity to the baseline level, while others gave little changes.

By imaging with EOS, we successfully detected the synaptically released glutamate following axon firings in cultured hippocampal neurons; the spatial distribution of the glutamate release was non-uniforml along dendrites. We also succeeded in monitoring the phorbol ester-induced potentiation of the glutamate release. Furthermore, we found spontaneous and stochastic glutamate release which was confined to small regions. Neither application of tetrodotoxin nor removal of extracellular calcium blocked the release. High concentrations of sucrose increased the frequency of the release. These features are reminiscent of those of miniature EPSC in electrophysiological recordings and thus suggest that the spontaneous release is quantal vesicular release. In conclusion, our probe directly visualizes the presynaptic release.",

A great deal of effort has been made in analyzing the dynamic state of protein synthesis in the living cells, chiefly by quantifying protein level. However, the protein level cannot mirror the spatio-temporal alteration of translation, because it cannot be affected only by protein synthesis but also by other factors like degradation. Therefore, it is problematic to visualize the dynamic state of translation by the present methods. To solve the problem, we applied FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) technique to in situ detection of the assembly and disassembly cycle among a pair of translation initiation factors (eIFs), thereby showing that BDNF and ephrin could potentiate local protein synthesis in the dendrites of hippocampal neurons.",

The key difference in condition B is that a fractal determines the reward but not the action. Subjects had learned the two conditions fully before scanning. At the fractal onset, the putamen, lateral ventral and medial dorsal prefrontal cortices showed stronger activity correlated with the predicted reward (P < 0.01) in A, while it was more prominent in the caudate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cerebellum in B.

The method involves using a patch electrode to perfuse the extracellular space surrounding the neuron of interest with a fluorescent dye, thus allowing the neuron to be visualized as a negative image and identified on the basis of its somatodendritic structure. The same electrode can then be placed on the neuron under visual control to allow gigaseal formation. We demonstrate the reliability and versatility of the method using recordings from principal neurons and interneurons in mouse and rat barrel cortex and cerebellum. We also show that the method can be used for in vivo juxtacellular labelling in identified cell types.

We analyzed the effect of slice cutting and incubation conditions on viability of cortical GABAergic neurons, using GAD67-GFP knock-in mice. We considered GFP positive cells as having survived. We observed more GFP-positive cells in the slices when NaCl in cutting solution was replaced with N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) chloride, choline chloride or sucrose. However, the viability was lower after 3 h incubation in NMDG-based solution than in NaCl-based solution. Cutting at 0 \u2022 C did not reduce the number of GFP-positive cells, but decreased GFP fluorescence in single neurons as compared with cutting at 20 \u2022 C. The viability after 3 h incubation was better kept at 20 \u2022 C than at 0 or 37 \u2022 C. We thus recommend that slices be cut at 20 \u2022 C in Na-free solution, and incubated at 20 \u2022 C in NaCl-based solution. We thank Dr Yanagawa for his generous gift of knock-in mice.",

Through MEGA-PRESS, a single peak of GSH stood out over other signals. In vivo, the brains of healthy volunteers gave similar signals as the in vitro phantom solution, indicating that the signal originated from GSH.

Although we are well aware that it is impossible to accurately estimate the 3-D neural cortical activity using the 2-D EEG/MEG surface potential topography, the upper limit of these techniques is not well described. During the past decades, various inverse approaches based on different criteria have been proposed, from the single dipole or multiple dipoles to the distributed current dipoles. However, it is difficult to systematically evaluate their efficiencies due to the different criteria and regularizations adopted in these methods. In this paper, we ask the question whether there exists an optimal approach based on a systematical criterion. This motivation firstly seems to be conflicted with the primary knowledge that there is no unique solution for the bioelectromagnetic inverse problem. Essentially, here we are trying to find an optimal inverse solution that is closest to the real current distribution.",

Anatomy and Embryology, Univ. Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan The distribution of chondroitin sulfates (CSs) around the optic tract in chick embryos was investigated by using anti-CS monoclonal antibodies with different specificities. The CSs are unbranched polymers composed of repeating disaccharide units of glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). The disaccharide units are classified into O, A, C, D, and E units based on the position(s) of the added sulfate group(s). The MO-225 monoclonal antibody recognizes CSs that are rich in the D-unit; the MO-225 epitopes were distributed in the diencephalotelencephalic boundary and the neuropil encircling the optic tract. In addition, they were distributed on membrane surfaces of the retinal axons running in an interface layer in contact with the neuropil encircling the optic tract. We discuss involvement of the CSs recognized by MO-225 in delimiting the border of the optic tract and in the chronological sorting of the retinal axons.

Numerous TRPV1-positive nerve fibers were distributed in the myenteric plexus throughout the esophagus, and most of them exhibited either SP-or CGRP-immunoreactivity (IR). An injection of Fast blue (FB) into the lower esophagus indicated that some labeled neurons were located in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of C1 to T13, and the majority of them occurred in T 5 to T12 of DRG. Most of the FB neurons that exhibited TRPV1-IR showed either SP-or CGRP-IR. Thus, these findings suggest that TRPV1-positive nerve fibers in the lower esophagus primarily originate from TRPV1/SP-and/or TRPV1/CGRP-positive sensory neurons in the thoracic DRG.Research funds: KAKENHI (15500236) PS1P-G121 Distributional pattern of subfornical organ neurons projecting to the magnocellular and parvocellular parts of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus Hitoshi Kawano, Sadahiko Masuko Dept. of Anat. & Physiol., Saga Univ., Saga, JapanThe subfornical organ (SFO) plays essential roles in osmoregulation and blood pressure control. The SFO projects to the magnocellular part of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVNm) where vasopressin (VP) neurons exist, and stimulation of the SFO causes VP release from the PVNm. The SFO also projects to the parvocellular parts of the PVN (PVNp), which send fibers to the median eminence and brainstem autonomic regions. However, it is unclear which SFO regions project to the PVNm and PVNp. To solve this issue, retrograde and anterograde tracing methods were done. After injection of a retrograde tracer, WGA-HRP-colloidal gold, into the rat PVNm and PVNp, labeled neurons were mostly found in the peripheral and central regions of the SFO, respectively. Iontophoretical injection of an anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine, in the peripheral and central regions of the SFO labeled afferents mostly in the PVNm and PVNp, respectively. This finding suggests that the SFO is divided into at least two subregions, according to the targets of the PVN.

Med., Univ. Tottori, Yonago, JapanThis study was undertaken to investigate firing patterns and spinal projections of respiratory neurons in medullary raphe nuclei of cat. Extracellular spikes of 28 single respiratory neurons were recorded in midline medullary tegmentum in Nembutal anesthetized cats. A total of 28 respiratory neurons was recorded in the raphe obscurus, pallidus and magunus. The cells were classified as Late-inspiratory (I) (n = 5), I-expiratory (E) phase-spanning (n = 5), E-I phase-spanning (n = 8), E-decrementing (n = 4), E-frequency modulated (n = 3), Iconstant (n = 3), based on their firing pattern in relation to the phase of respiration. Out of the 18 respiratory neurons were tested for antidromic activation from the ventrolateral quadrant of the C4-5 spinal cord, two E-frequency modulated, one E-decrementing and one E-I phase-spanning neuron were antidromically activated with the latencies that corresponded to axonal conduction velocities of 12.8-27.3 m/s. These results suggest that some non-serotoninergic respiratory neurons of the caudal raphe nuclei transmit respiratory activity to the spinal cord.",

Although treadmill running and ischemia have been known to activate neurogenesis in DG of hippocampus, it is unknown whether Mash1+ cells in the SGZ are stimulated by treadmill running. The present study examined effects of chronic treadmill running (CTR) on Mash1+ cells in the SGZ of the DG in adult rats. Rats were divided into nonrunning group and running group that perform treadmill running at a speed of 22 m/min, 30 min/days for 7 days, and Mash1+ cells were identified using immunohistochemical techniques. Results indicated that majority of Mash1+ cells in both groups was proliferative state, and that the number of proliferating Mash1+ cells in the SGZ was increased by CTR. These results suggest that running enhances production of new neurons in neurogenesis by increasing the number of proliferating Mash1+ cells.PS2A-C031 Differential regulation of Mash1 and Olig2 by A \u2424 accelerates the death of neurosphere cellsYoko Uchida, Fujiya Gomi RT for Geriatric disorders, TMIG, Tokyo, Japan Neurogenesis is enhanced in AD or a mutant APP transgenic mouse hippocampus. However, A \u2424 action on neural stem cells has been controversial. Mash1 and Olig2 are bHLH factors, which are involved in initiating neurogenesis or gliogenesis. The regulation of these bHLH factors in AD has not known yet. Here we have demonstrated the upregulation of Mash1 and down-regulation of Olig2 in cerebral cortical cultures treated with A \u24241-42. Mash1 was expressed in nestin-positive immature cells but was rarely expressed in postmitotic neurons. Majority of Mash1-positive cells in the cortical culture co-expressed Olig2. A \u2424 increased in the proportion of Olig2-negative/mash1+ cells, which are lineage marker-negative cells. These results indicate that A \u2424 may alter the gene expression of Mash1 and Olig2 in immature cells, possibly neural stem cells. Overexpression of Mash1 in neurosphere cells enhanced neural differentiation. However, co-expression of Mash1 and Olig2 siRNA in neurosphere cells accelerated cell death.",

However, it is still unknown whether purinergic receptor activation can modulate synaptic transmission in spinal motor neurons. By use of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, we investigated the effects of extracellular ATP on ventral horn neurons of rat spinal cord slices. Bath application of ATP (100 M) or ATP\u2425S (100 M), a metabolic stable ATP analog, produced an inward current at \u221270 mV in about 30% of neurons examined. The ATP\u2425S-induced current was resistant to TTX and was mimicked by 2-methylthio ADP (100 M), but not by \u2423,\u2424-methylene ATP, BzATP, UTP, or UDP (each 100 M). These results indicate that extracellular ATP directly excites a subpopulation of ventral horn neurons by activation of purinergic receptors. Thus, purinergic receptor antagonist may constitute a new medication for the treatment of spinal cord injury.

Recently, we determined that retrotransposon with promoter activity induced transcription of nearby non-coding RNAs, which contain the genome-embedded NRSE sequence. The promoter contained DNA regulatory elements for both Sox and TCF/LEF transcription factors. The non-coding RNA expression nearby retrotransposon was repressed in NSCs expressing Sox2. While the silencing effect was depressed in neuroblast cells.

Neuroendocr., Grad. Sch. Compreh. Human Sci., Univ. Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan A previous study revealed that long-term memory trace of motor learning sort to the vestibular nucleus (VN) from the flocculus (FL) using daily optokinetic adaptation paradigm(Shutoh et al., 2006). However, how the memory trace formed in VN is still unclear. In the present study, we studied changes in an excitatory activity of VN neurons following long-term activation of FL by evaluating VGLUT gene expression with in situ hybridization. Train pulses were delivered via microelectrode inserted to unilateral FL for 45 min and repeated for three days. One day after the stimulation, brains were removed for histology. The intensity of VGLUT signals is higher in ipsilateral than contralateral VN of the stimulation site. Since VGLUTs seem to modulate quantal size of synaptic vesicles at glutamatergic terminals, regulation of VGLUT gene expression may take part in the formation of the long-term memory trace in VN.Research funds: Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) 17700320PS1A-H142 Threshold regulation of cerebellar LTD is critical for motor learning efficiencyTomonori Takeuchi 1 , Gen Ohtsuki 2 , Takashi Yoshida 2 , Masahiro Fukaya 3 , Tasuku Wainai 1 , Hisashi Mori 1 , Kenji Sakimura 4 , Susumu Kawamoto 5 , Masahiko Watanabe 3 , Tomoo Hirano 2 , Masayoshi Mishina 1 1 Dept.

This RP induction is suppressed when postsynaptic GABA B R is activated during the depolarization through downregulation of PKA via G i /G o protein. We have examined whether mGluR1 is involved in the regulation of RP. Current responses to GABA or miniature IPSCs were recorded from a cultured rat PN, and RP was induced by direct depolarization. A mGluR1 antagonist CPCCOEt prevented RP, while a mGluR1 agonist DHPG rescued RP from its suppression by GABA B Rs. Neither PLC nor PKC inhibitor was involved in the RP rescue by DHPG. On the other hand, PKA activation abolished the RP suppression by CPCCOEt, and PKA inhibition impaired the RP rescue by DHPG. Further a peptide that competitively inhibit the binding of DARPP-32 and PP-1 disturbed the RP rescue by DHPG, and a PP-1 inhibitor rescued RP from suppression by CPCCOEt. Taken together, mGluR1 regulates RP through PKA, DARPP-32 and PP-1 pathway.PS1P-B016 Comparison of long-term depression induced by low frequency stimulation and tetanic stimulation in the rat auditory cortex Kenji Wtanabe, Daiki Kamatani, Ryuichi Hishida, Masaharu Kudoh, Katsuei Shibuki Dept.

However, mechanisms of [Ca 2+ ] i elevation are still unclear. To understand mechanisms for [Ca 2+] i increase, we studied depolarization-induced Ca 2+ responses from single astrocytes in hippocampal slices. Astrocytes were loaded with Ca 2+ indicator fluo-4 (100 M) by electrophoresis from patch pipettes. Ca 2+ responses were imaged every 30 ms with a CCD camera (EM-CCD C9100-12, Hamamatsu Photonics) attached to an epifluorescent microscope. Depolarizing current was applied from patch pipettes for duration of 1 s. Two different types of [Ca 2+ ] i elevation were induced. Firstly, [Ca 2+ ] i increased during the depolarization (10 cells out of 13). Secondary, additional Ca 2+ elevation was observed after the end of the depolarization with a delay of few seconds (4 cells out of 13). These findings imply that depolarization alone is sufficient to induce Ca 2+ elevation in astrocytes.PS1P-C025 Sodium sensitive sodium channel Na x regulates glial glucose metabolism Hidetada Shimizu, Eiji Watanabe, Takeshi Y.

We previously demonstrated that endogenous neurotrophin-3 (NT3) acting through the TrkC tyrosine kinase receptor enhances migration of premyelinating Schwann cells. This signaling pathway is mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade regulated by the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42. However, missing is the link between TrkC and the GTPases. Here we show that a guaninenucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Dbs couples with TrkC to activate Cdc42 in Schwann cells. Furthermore, TrkC directly phosphorylates Dbs, thereby inducing the Cdc42-GEF activity. Taken together, activation of TrkC triggers Schwann cell migration by regulating Dbs upon direct tyrosine-phosphorylation, providing a mechanism whereby a membrane receptor tyrosine kinase can induce the activation of Rho GTPase-GEFs.

Kocsis Dept. of Neurol, Yale Univ, New Haven, CT, USA Olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC) engrafted into the demyelinated spinal cord can form compact myelin. However, little is known of the expression and organization of ion channels in the remyelinated axons, or whether the exogenous cells provide appropriate signaling for the maturation of nodes of Ranvier. Here we analyzed the remyelinated axons by the transplanted GFP-OECs into chemically induced demyelinated spinal cord. In the remyelinated axons, Nav 1.6 was clustered at nodes, while Kv 1.2 was aggregated in juxtaparanodal regions. Moreover, the recruitment of Nav and Kv channels to specific domains at remyelinated nodes persisted for at least 8 weeks. Electrophysiological recordings showed enhanced conduction velocities. These findings indicate that engrafted OECs provide an environment that supports the development and maturation of nodes of Ranvier and the restoration of impulse conduction in central demyelination.PS1P-C034 Role of sub-febrile doses of bacterial pyrogen in spinal cord injury repair as a glial scar preventing agent Sankar Venkatachalam, Rathinasamy Muthusamy Department of Anatomy, University of Madras, Taramani Campus, Chennai, India",

(KI) PS1P-D046 Synthesis and localization of CNTF in cultured adult rat dorsal root ganglion neurons Kazunori Sango, Hiroko Yanagisawa Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience, Tokyo, JapanCiliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is abundantly expressed in Schwann cells in adult mammalian peripheral nerves, and may play a role in nerve repair after axonal injury. Consistent with previous studies, our immunohistochemical analysis on the sections of adult rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) revealed that the CNTF expression was restricted to Schwann cells and was not found in DRG neurons. In contrast, the intense immunoreactivity for CNTF was detected in the cytoplasm of almost all DRG neurons at any observation period (3 h, 3, 7 or 15 days) in culture. Although the CNTF expression was predominant in neuronal cell bodies, we observed the immunoreactivity in regenerating neurites at 7 and 15 days in culture. Further studies with in situ hybridization showed abundant CNTF mRNA expression in the cytoplasm of cultured DRG neurons. These findings suggest that CNTF is synthesized in cultured DRG neurons and transported to the neurites. Endogenous CNTF may promote DRG neuronal survival and/or neurite regeneration in vitro, as exogenous one has shown such effects.PS1P-D047 Transactivation of TrkB receptor mediated by dopamine D1 receptor in developmental striatal neuronsYuriko Iwakura, Moses Chao Mol. Neurobiol., Skirball Inst. of Biomol. Medicine, New York Univ. School of Medicine, NY, USA BDNF/TrkB signaling mediates trophic effects on both mature and immature striatal neurons. Dopamine is one of main components that regulates striatum function through dopamine receptors work as a Gprotein coupled receptor (GPCR). It has been suggested that not only neurotrophins but neurotransmitters may modulate neurotrophic function in developing neurons. However, the molecular mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we treated striatal culture neurons with dopamine receptor agonists and measured the effects on the transactivation of TrkB and its downstream substrates. The results show that D1 dopamine receptor agonist SKF38393 phosphorylates TrkB, and such receptor activation is mimicked by PKA stimulator. Moreover, this phosphorylation is not inhibited by BDNF neutralize antibody. We hypothesize that the endogenous dopamine can modulate striatal TrkB intracellular signaling through GPCR-mediated transactivation in developing striatum neurons, and thereby this transactivation may influence the neuronal development and function.Research funds: NIH Grant NS21072PS1P-D048 Chronic antidepressants potentiate via sigma-1 receptors the brain-derived neurotrophic factorinduced signaling for glutamate release Tadahiro Numakawa 1 , Yuki Yagasaki 1 , Emi Kumamaru 1 , Teruo Hayashi 2 , Su Tsung Ping 2 , Hiroshi Kunugi 1 1 Dept. of Mental Disorder Research, NIN, NCNP, Tokyo, Japan; 2 NIDA/NIH, USA We examined in this study possible effects of chronic antidepressants on the BDNF signaling through the PLC-\u2425/IP 3 /Ca 2+ pathway. We found that the BDNF-stimulated PLC-\u2425 activation and the ensued increase in intracellular Ca 2+ were potentiated by pretreatment with imipramine or fluvoxamine, so was the BDNF-induced glutamate release. Further, imipramine pretreatment enhanced binding of PLC-\u2425 to TrkB (receptor for BDNF). BD1047, a potent Sig-1R antagonist, blocked the imipramine-dependent potentiation on the BDNF-induced PLC-\u2425 activation and glutamate release. Interestingly, overexpression of Sig-1R per se, without antidepressant pretreatment, also enhances the BDNF-induced PLC-\u2425 activation and glutamate release. These results suggested that chronic antidepressants selectively enhance the BDNF signaling on the PLC-\u2425/IP 3 /Ca 2+ pathway via Sig-1R, and that Sig-1R plays an important role in BDNF signaling leading to glutamate release.Daichi Hara, Toshihide Miyashita, Aya Minamino, Toshifumi Watanabe, Akiko Tabuchi, Masaaki Tsuda Dept.

To explain the quantal nature, it has been hypothesized that a decrease in luminal Ca 2+ attenuates Ca 2+ efflux. However, the mechanism for the attenuation of Ca 2+ efflux remains an enigma. We show that voltageand Ca 2+ -activated potassium channels in Ca 2+ store control Ca 2+ release. The potassium channel was identified as BK-type, activated by positive shifts in luminal potential and luminal Ca 2+ increases. The closing or blockage of store BK channels developed lumennegative potentials and suppressed Ca 2+ release. Ca 2+ uptake by Ca 2+ pumps would reactivate the store BK channels regeneratively with K + entry to allow repetitive Ca 2+ release. Indeed, the luminal potential oscillated bistably \u223c45 mV in amplitude as revealed with an organelle-specific voltage-sensitive dye[DiOC 5 (3)]. Our study suggests that Ca 2+ release-induced closings of store BK channels cause a lumen-negative potential towards the equilibrium potential for Ca 2+ to attenuate Ca 2+ efflux.",

Med., Sendai, JapanThe aim of this study was to investigate the role of histamine H1 receptor (H1R) in cognition in physiological and pathological conditions by using H1R mutant (H1\u2212/\u2212) mice. In normal condition, several behavioral studies indicated H1\u2212/\u2212 mice show impaired object recognition and spatial memory, improved conditioned fear memory. Moreover, hippocampal long-term potentiation was reduced in H1\u2212/\u2212 mice. These results indicate H1 receptor is involved in memory process for which the frontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus interact. In pathological condition, both H1\u2212/\u2212 and control mice were subjected to social isolation, an animal model of schizophrenia. Social isolation impaired locomotion, prepulse inhibition of startle response and water maze performance in control mice, but not in H1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Mutation of H1 receptor decreases isolation-induced hyperactivity of cortical dopaminergic neurons. These findings indicate blockage of H1R attenuates social isolation-induced behavioral changes. In conclusion, blockage of H1R impairs cognition in normal conditions, whereas H1R blocking inversely improves cognition in disease models of schizophrenia.Research funds: KAKENHI (17390156; 14370027) PS3A-H133 5-HT2A receptor gene polymorphism modulates activation in the human ventrolateral frontal lobe during Go/No-go task Michio Nomura 1,2 , Hirohito-M.

We examined whether this 5-HT2A receptor gene polymorphism is involved in impulsive aggression by evaluating a reward-punishment Go/No-go task using fMRI. Participants were required to learn to respond to active stimuli and inhibit their response to passive stimuli both under the reward-only (R) condition and the punishment-only (P) condition. The R condition, compared with the P condition caused right prefrontal activation mainly seen in ventrolateral regions. It has been reported that the possible involvement of the 5-HT2A receptor gene polymorphism in impulsive behavior (Nomura et al., 2005) , together with the present findings, this observation indicates the involvement of 5-HT2A receptor gene polymorphisms in ventrolateral frontal lobe.Research funds: Shimojo Implicit Brain Function Project, ERATO, JST PS3A-H134 Role of cortical thin arterioles in neurovascular coupling; analyses of Kir6.1-containing ATPsensitive potassium channel-deficient mice PS3P-G095 REM sleep deprivation increases serum ceruloplasmin level Manoj Jaiswal 1 , Chinmay K. Mukhopadhyay 2 , Birendra N. Mallick 1 1 School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India; 2 Special Centre of Molecular Medicine, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India Rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) is present across higher species and is essential for life. Its loss predisposes one to several pathophysiological conditions. Continuous loss of REMS leads to several diseases and extreme loss may be fatal. REMS loss is reported to increase metabolism and food intake though associated with hypothermia. Hence, we proposed that the REMS deprivation would affect acute phase response protein. In this study rats were REMS deprived by platform method. Free moving normal, large platform and recovery from REMS loss were used as controls. Blood was collected from the same rat before and after experimental as well as control periods. Level of serum cruloplasmin, a positive acute phase response protein, was detected using Western-Blot analysis. The results showed that REMS deprivation increased the serum ceruloplasmin level suggesting that the REMS deprivation triggers an acute phase response at least in rats.Research funds: Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India and DST, India The indirect cytopathic effect in HIV-1 and the direct infection of HSV-1 are critical in their pathogenesis. We established murine neurosphere and evaluated with cocultivation of HIV-1 JRFL-infected macrophages or with HSV-1. The generation of primary neurospheres did not suppressed by HIV-1-infection or by HSV-1 infection at no more that MOI 10. In the secondary neurospheres, CD133 + neural stem cells were intact in these infections, although beta-3-tubulin + cells were decreased in HIV-1 infection and intact in HSV-1-infection. In the differentiation assay, NeuN + NFP + neurons in HIV-1-infection and GFAP + S100 + astrocytes in HSV-1 infection were significantly decreased. The migration capacity of the neurosphere cells was suppressed in HIV-1 infection and in HSV-1 infection. We conclude that neural stem cells in vitro are resistant to cytopathic effect by HIV-1 and HSV-1 infection and their differentiation capacities are different in these infections. Our assay will be one of the significant methods in neurovirological research.Research funds: KAKENHI 17790579 Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists(B) PS3P-G097 Effects of attraction to favorite opposite gender on nervous, endocrine, and immune systems Masahiro Matsunaga 1,2 , Taeko Yamauchi 2 , Toshihiro Konagaya 2 , Hideki Ohira 1 1 Department of Psychology, Nagoya University, Japan; 2 Department of Internal Medicine, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Japan Everybody can \"fall in love\". Thus everybody knows that attraction to favorite opposite gender invokes positive feelings and often makes us energetic. To investigate effects of this positive emotion on the biological systems, we recorded various parameters, namely mood states, heart rate, skin conductance level (SCL), serum levels of several hormones, and proportions of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in the lymphocytes simultaneously when subjects viewed the video films of their favorite opposite genders. When the subjects were evoked their attraction to favorite opposite gender, they became more vigorous and felt better. As for the biological systems, SCL and the proportion of NK cells in the lymphocytes significantly increased. These results suggest the possibility that attraction to favorite opposite gender may have a role in activating NK cell-related innate immune system by means of the activation of SCL-related sympathetic nervous system.",

We have previously reported that TN is one of the essential molecules for proliferation of the primary culture of astrocytes. From injured mouse brain model with stab wound, GFAP expression was down regulated sharply at earlier stages in TN/KO mouse than in the WT mouse. Some of the inflammatory cytokines are known to be expressed in injured CNS, and also those receptors are expressed in the primary culture of astrocytes. To evaluate immune responses in the CNS, some of the inflammatory cytokine production was determined in the lesioned mouse brain compared with TN/KO and WT mouse. From RT-PCR method, TN seemed to have the possible roles for some of the cytokine prodution at the CNS lesion sites. We are currently investigating the function of tenascin for the cytokine production around the lesion site.",

Sch. of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; 2 Dept. of Information Science and Technology, Osaka Institute of Technology, Osaka, Japan Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of arachidonic acid (AA) evokes fever. This response has been thought to occur simply because AA is converted to prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), the final mediator of fever. However, our recent study suggested that AA might not only be the precursor of PGE 2 but also induce an enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) that catalyses AA to form prostaglandins. We here examined in rats whether i.c.v. injection of AA induces COX-2, and whether COX-2 is involved in AA-induced fever. Two hours after i.c.v. injection of AA, COX-2 was expressed in the perinuclear region of brain endothelial cells. AA-induced fever was partly suppressed with a COX-2 specific inhibitor, NS-398. These results indicate that AA itself or its metabolites induces COX-2 that accelerates the formation of PGE 2 from AA, and, hence, enhances fever.",

However, its cellular mechanism remains unknown. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is a useful tool for measuring microscopic states of the brain tissue by probing water diffusion.We examined changes of DWI following rTMS to further understand its effects. Four healthy volunteers received rTMS at 0.9 Hz (10 min; 90% of the rest motor threshold) applied over the left primary motor area (M1). We scanned 4 sets of DWI (before, and 0 min, 10 min and 20 min after rTMS) using 3-T MR scanner, and calculated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). In 3 out of 4 subjects, the ADC decreased (mean 1.72 \u00d7 10 \u22125 /mm 2 s \u22121 ) in the left M1 just after the rTMS, which recovered at 20 min. It is possible that the rTMS-induced change of ADC might occur as the cellular response. Further examination is needed for confirming this point.",

Ioannides Laboratory for Human Brain Dynamics, Brain Science Institute RIKEN, Wako-shi, JapanRetinotopic areas V6 and V6A in macaques occupy almost the entire extend of the anterior bank of parieto-occipital sulcus (POS). V6A located more dorsal has a larger receptive field size then V6. Both areas lack a foveal magnification. We used MEG to record brain activity while human subjects were viewing stimuli presented at two different eccentricities in each quadrant of visual fields. To verify the reliability of results, for each subject, the experiment was repeated on three different days. Tomographic analysis of MEG signal, in each subject, identified highly reproducible activations throughout visual cortex in accord with the known organization. Two new areas along the POS with a similar retinotopy to that of macaques V6 and V6A were identified. In the ventral one, activations in response to each stimulus were spatially separated. The foveal magnification was much reduced compared to V1 in both areas and in the more dorsal area activations elicited by stimuli in the same quadrant could not be separated. Given the above finding we suggest these areas as possible homologues of macaques V6 and V6A.PS3P-I144 Measurement of magnetic evoked field of ratmeasurement of magnetic evoked field of rat using micro SQUID Naohiro Tsuyuguchi Department of Neurosurgery, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, JapanThe study of neural activity in rodents would be enhanced by the stimulation of neuronal function in vivo. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is used to study brain function in humans, but the limited resolution and sensitivity of conventional instruments have precluded the use of MEG to study neuronal function in rodents. We demonstrate that micro MEG developed for use with small animals, can be used to detect assess neuronal activity in conscious rodent brain. We used a micro 9-channel magnetometer consisting of a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix of superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) with its integrated base of 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 mm to measure the visual evoked magnetic field (VEF) and auditory evoked field (AEF) of rats. We obtained the VEF wave with 60-80 ms peak by the white LED flashing stimulation and the AEF wave with 10-20 ms peak by the tone and burst stimulation. This study demonstrate that micro MEG can be used for serial assessment of neuronal function of individual, live animals with a minimal degree of invasiveness, has the potential for use in the study of brain function and plasticity.",

Lippert, Jian-Young Wu Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA Voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging is used to study visually evoked responses in rat visual cortex, in single trials without averaging. The signal is small, and a diode array with an effective dynamic range of 19 bits was used, along with a \"blue dye\" (RH 1691) with small heartbeat artifact. A subtraction algorithm was used to further remove heartbeat artifact in the data. With the combination of the array, the blue dye and the algorithm, we were able to visualize sensory evoked wave activity with a high signal-to-noise ratio in single trials. The signals were 0.1-0.05% of the resting fluorescence intensity. Spatiotemporally, the evoked response manifested as propagating waves in the visual areas. There were large trial-to-trial variations in the propagating velocity and directions of the waves. The evoked wave apparently interacted with spontaneous waves in the cortex, and varied greatly according to anesthetic regimen. Visualizing evoked waves may contribute to the understanding of cortical dynamics underlying sensory processing.",

Bilateral somatosensory cortices were activated with a stimulus time lag between test stimuli (electrical pulses to contralateral hindpaw) and conditioning stimuli (to a homologous somatosensory region of the contralateral hemisphere). We measured electrophysiological signals (local field potentials and multiunit activity) and optical intrinsic signals (586 and 610 nm, indicators of CBV and oxygenation), and analyzed the dependence of the signals on the time lag. The results showed that both neuronal and hemodynamic signals were suppressed around 20-ms time lag. Average and trial-by-trial correlation analyses suggested that the hemodynamic signals reflected a balance of neuronal excitation and inhibition via callosal connections. We can infer some parts of underlying neural interactions by imaging of the hemodynamic signals.",

We have developed the recording system with longer continuous recording capacity and larger signal-to-noise ratio to detect spontaneous activity in a single sweep. We applied this system to the sensorimotor cortex of rats anesthetized with a mixture of urethane and \u2423-chloralose. The hindlimb region was exposed and stained with RH414, a voltage sensitive dye. Optical records, after compensation for pulsation artifacts, contained deflections time-locked to the high amplitude transient waves, characteristic to \u2423-chloralose anesthesia, recorded with a wire electrode placed in the optically sampling area. As the transient in the electrocorticogram fluctuated, the optical signal also varied. This signal was distributed over a broad region, whose latency, amplitude or shape varied systematically within the region, probably reflecting the regional differences in the transient activity.",

Allen Waggoner, Kenichi Ueno, Keiji Tanaka, Kang Cheng BSI, RIKEN, Saitama, JapanObjective: In this fMRI study, we attempted to identify the brain regions involved in the process completing objects with degraded image information.Method: Fourteen healthy subjects were studied using a 4T MRI scanner while performing a matching-to-sample task with three task conditions. The main condition required the subject to judge in a 4-s trial if a trial-unique, degraded animal image matched a contour image. In the comparison condition, we reversed the order presenting intact and degraded images (ID epoch).Results: Comparing images acquired in DI epochs with those acquired in ID epochs, significant activation was found in the left parietooccipital cortex spanning the cuneus (BA18), superior occipital gyrus around the parieto-occipital sulcus (BA19) and superior parietal lobule (BA7). Other activated foci include the left anterior cingulated cortex, left dorsal frontal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus.Conclusion: These results indicate that the parieto-occipital cortex is critically involved in the object completion with degraded images.PS3P-J155 Influence of task difficulty during meter inspection: An fMRI study Naoki Miura 1,2 , Makoto Takahashi 3 , Jobu Watanabe 2,4 , Shinya Uchida 2,5 , Shigeru Sato 6 , Kaoru Horie 6 , Masaharu Kitamura 2 , Toshio Wakabayashi 2 , Katsuki Nakamura 1,7 , Ryuta Kawashima 2 1 CREST, JST, Kawaguchi, Japan; 2 NICHe, Tohoku Univ.

We compared brain activation during meter inspection tasks with different task difficulty. During the meter inspection tasks, the subjects were instructed to inspect the three meters, and to press the button, if the subject found abnormal state. The task difficulty was devised by controlling the rate of change for the value to be displayed. In the right occipitotemporal area and the left cerebellar posterior lobule, activation during analog meter inspection was greater when the task difficulty was higher case. The results suggest that these regions are related to attention and perception of visual appearance of HMI.PS3P-J156 Neural connectivity among brain areas related to language function Shinya Uchida 1,2,3 , Naoki Miura 2,4 , Jobu Watanabe 5 , Shigeo Kinomura 1 , Kazunori Sato 1 , Yasuyuki Taki 1 , Kentaro Inoue 1 , Ryoi Goto 1 , Ai Fukushima 2 , Kaoru Horie 6 , Shigeru Sato 6 , Katsuki Nakamura 3 , Hiroshi Fukuda 1 , Ryuta Kawashima 2 1 Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiology, IDAC, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; 2 NICHe, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; 3 National Institute of Neuroscience, NCNP, Kodaira, Japan; 4 Japan Science and Technology Agency, Kawaguchi, Japan; 5 BME Institute, ASMeW, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan; 6 Graduate School of International Cultural Studies, Tohoku University, Sendai, JapanThe present study examined the neural connectivity of languagerelated regions using functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging tractography (DTT). Twenty subjects were participated. Functional region of interest (ROI) in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) defined by fMRI during speech production task was used as a seed point for DTT. In more than 80% of subjects, tracts between the ROI and the left thalamus (LTh) were estimated. Post hoc fMRI analysis showed activation in the LTh during speech production tasks. Therefore, cortical connectivity between the LIFG and LTh may have certain functional roles in speech production.",

Healthy subjects judged whether the utterance in a picture such as irony, metaphor, or control expressions was situationally appropriate (S), or literally correct (L). Greater activation during S than L task was analyzed to identify the activation for implicit meanings and neural responses to irony or metaphor were analyzed. The left medial prefrontal cortex showed higher activity during the S than L task. The medial orbitofrontal cortex and the right temporal pole showed responses selective to the irony; the responses in the former were observed during S task only, while the latter in both tasks. No selective response to metaphor was observed.",

We studied the effects of anticipation of positive and negative affective images on neural processes estimated with MEG and event-related fMRI. Participants were presented emotionally positive or negative images with cue stimuli. The cue stimulus indicated the emotional valence of the image which followed a few seconds later. In MEG study, visual evoked field (VEF) was smaller for the anticipatable negative image than the anticipatable positive image. This result suggests that when the presentation of a negative image is anticipated before the event, neural processing for the image is depressed compared to when a positive image is anticipated. Furthermore, we report the difference of brain activation between anticipation of positive images and that of negative images in event-related fMRI study.",

As an example, we compared Iba-1 positive glial cell densities in rats with and without unilateral injection of MPP+. Immunopositive cell density map was automatically created in each animal over a coronal section in the midbrain (bregma \u22125.9 mm). After the map was normalized to a template section, positive cell densities of the two groups were compared in each pixel and a statistical parameter was mapped on each pixel. We were able to detect significant increases of microglias in the side of the injection not only in the substantia nigra pars compacta but also in the white matters. The new method was proven to be useful for detecting significant changes of cell densities over the entire area of immunostained sections.",
