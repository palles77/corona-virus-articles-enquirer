With such great differences, interventions must be targeted to the local situation and population of concern. Since 1988, international cooperation projects have been an important part of China's HIV/AIDS prevention and control efforts. The strategies and experiences of these international cooperation projects are gradually being integrated into China's national HIV/AIDS prevention and control work, while still adapting to the situation at the local level. In this way, an HIV/AIDS prevention model unique to China is being formed, which in turn is having a positive impact on HIV/AIDS prevention and control efforts among the international community. The principle areas of investment have been in  policy advocacy, monitoring, case detection, HIV  prevention  and  intervention,  stigma  and  discrimination reduction, care and support, capacity building, multi-sector cooperation and promotion of community-based organization (CBO) involvement. Yunnan, Henan and Sichuan have been the largest provincial recipients of funds, with each receiving 420 million USD. 1 Across China, these projects have introduced strategies for meeting local needs, exploring innovative methods, promoting international best practices and implementing successful HIV/AIDS control activities. As the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China evolved, 2 international support reflected these changing challenges ( Figure 1 ). (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) In the initial stage of collaboration, the international community helped China build its HIV surveillance system as well as health professionals' trainings and public awareness campaigns.",

WHO initially provided 500 000 USD to support HIV testing reagents and equipment in eight cities in 1988. Then, in 1993, WHO assisted in the planning of the initial HIV/AIDS surveillance program. 3 Following the WHO activities, advocacy, education and surveillance efforts were launched. The first large international project was one million USD from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for training in Yunnan province. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the European Union (EU), the Australian Red Cross, and other international organizations and international NGOs had activities focusing on HIV/AIDS monitoring, advocacy and training in 12 cities. The programmes also supported media campaigns on HIV/AIDS prevention and control. Exploratory work was carried out in the area of stigma and discrimination reduction. For example, UNICEF supported the 'Unite For youth, Unite Against AIDS' global campaign, in which a couple of young students were chosen to be the youth ambassadors to join activities for promoting AIDS awareness in universities.",

This stage saw advancement in the development of HIV/ AIDS prevention, control and care models, and provided a foundation for the establishment of HIV/AIDS policies. As China's HIV/AIDS epidemic became localized in high-prevalence areas, China's comprehensive HIV/ AIDS prevention and control work expanded significantly. The World Bank (WB) supported the Health IX project in China for HIV testing and screening laboratory network capacity construction. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the China-UK AIDS project funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) focused on interventions among high-risk groups were also introduced to China during this period. The US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) Global AIDS Program (GAP) works closely with NCAIDS on surveillance, laboratory methods, interventions for hard-to-reach populations and improving HIV care and treatment (Programme Summary can be found at the website: http://www. uscdc.cn/en/content.jsp?classid\u00bc14&articleid\u00bc28). The programme plays a significant role in improving the effectiveness of national and provincial programmes and piloting innovative methods. The China-Australia AIDS Project, funded by AusAID, advocates for harm reduction strategies has greatly influenced China's policy towards harm reduction. The China-Germany Program provided continuous support on laboratory equipment, training, technical assistance and infrastructure construction. The China-Sweden program provided financial support from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) to help support the Chinese government to achieve the goal of reducing HIV secondary transmission.",

International projects have reduced the shortage of financial and technical support in Yunnan. They have achieved remarkable success in advocating for policy change, building capacity, establishing interventions, conducting surveillance, testing MARPs and providing anti-retroviral treatment to those in need. Studies found that the incidence of HIV dropped among the MARPs from 15.4% in 2004 to 9.8% in 2007, even though risk behaviours still remain in the local population. [9] [10] [11] Introducing advanced concepts, strategies, technologies and best practices International cooperation projects not only bring funding to China, but also introduce advanced theories and strategies. These strategies have been employed in several areas, including using surveillance to promote testing and early diagnosis of HIV infection, increasing universal access to AIDS care and treatment and preventing second-generation HIV transmission, among others. These activities have significantly accelerated the improvement of China's HIV/AIDS surveillance strategy from passive surveillance to active case finding combined with case management. In 2000, China initiated a voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) pilot programme with the support of the WHO, the UNFPA and the China-UK programme. Based on the experiences of the pilot programme, VCT became a national strategy in 2004 and was expanded to 7335 sites by December 2009. The surveillance strategy has also changed from sero-surveillance to behavioural surveillance, and later to comprehensive surveillance, which is the combination of the serology and the behavioural surveillance. The development of surveillance system impacts the determination of AIDS policy and the use of HIV/AIDS resource. 12-14 UNAIDS and WHO have recommended a series of intervention measures for high-risk populations including VCT, health education, condom promotion and social marketing, methadone maintenance treatment and needle exchange. In 2001, with the cooperation of WHO, China launched a condom promotion project in Hubei, Jiangsu, Hunan and Hainan provinces. In Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, the China-UK program also began to explore intervention models among commercial sex workers and condom social marketing. These projects proved to be useful in the Chinese context. Several interventions, including condom promotion, STD clinic-based outreach and intervention among low-fee sex workers and clients, have all been developed and are still improving. These methods have been adopted as national guidelines for HIV/AIDS control and were scaled-up throughout the country. Experiences accumulated in these projects have been very helpful to explore appropriate intervention models for high-risk populations in China. These experiences have established a base for the generalization of best practices and have informed strategies at the national level. For example, condom promotion was adopted in the national HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment Regulation in 2006.",

Several innovative intervention activities were conducted with the cooperation of the MSM community, including hotlines, face-to-face counselling, theme parties, internet-based education and peer education. These intervention methods were widely scaled-up and continue to play a leading role in behavioural interventions among MSM in China. In 2008-09, China conducted a survey among MSM in 61 cities to determine the extent of HIV infection among this population with support from BMGF. 15 International cooperation projects have played a vital role in exploring models for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). Moreover, many international organizations, such as WHO, Global Fund China AIDS Program, CHAI, Improving the social environment surrounding HIV/AIDS Through these collaborations, China has increased the number of government agencies collaborating on the response to AIDS. These agencies have in turn adopted policies emphasizing transparency and the open sharing of data. To some extent, the involvement of international cooperation makes the various levels of government more serious about HIV prevention and pushes to improve the social environment surrounding HIV/AIDS. Advocacy for policy change and the development of strategic plans are a major task in the early stage of most international cooperation projects. Through a series of activities, including training, investigations, study sessions and workshops involving government officials and policy-makers from multiple sectors, an enabling environment has been created promoting cooperation between multiple sectors. This provides strong support for national leadership development and policy advocacy. China's HIV/AIDS comprehensive response mechanism, which is a government-led, multi-sector cooperation and involves participation of the whole society, was created one step at a time. Top national leaders have visited AIDS patients, supervised HIV prevention work and encouraged health workers during the annual World AIDS Day activities. This has set a good example for the whole society to follow. Supported by these programmes, the State Council AIDS Working Committee Office has issued several documents and guidelines such as Mid 16, 17 Strengthening capacity and developing grassroots social organizations With the aid of international cooperation projects, the capacity of staff at HIV prevention and control departments at the national, provincial and local levels has been improved. Improving the capacity of personnel is consistently one of the most important objectives for international projects. Technical documents, developed by different projects, have proven helpful to local health workers in mounting a rapid response to emergencies as well as in improving problem-solving capabilities and technical standardization. Some international cooperation projects have organized training sessions, workshops and study tours to improve abilities in project management, specialized knowledge and research methods. International cooperation projects create a team of HIV/AIDS fighters who are not only familiar with advanced international information and technology, but who also have ample field work experience. They have become the main force in fighting AIDS in China. In addition, programmes support applied research in HIV/AIDS prevention and control. The results of research provide valuable knowledge and scientific evidence for improving China's HIV/AIDS prevention and control work. 18, 19 Training has also been conducted at village and township levels. China has embraced its international obligation to support other developing countries with HIV/AIDS prevention and control assistance by providing financial and technical support. Focuses of assistance have included training HIV/AIDS professionals in African countries; implementing cross-border activities with Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam; having donated 10 million USD to GFATM and just announced donating another 14 million USD in next 3 years; introducing China's HIV/AIDS prevention and control experiences to visitors and study groups from developing countries and actively participating in international and regional HIV/AIDS prevention and control conferences to communicate and share information.",

The centre has trained more than 100 village doctors on HIV/AIDS treatment and care. In 2010, US CDC-GAP established the second training centre in Luzhai County, Guangxi Autonomous Region. Supported by the GFATM Round 3 China AIDS Project, second-line ART regimens were used in seven provinces in central China where AIDS patients have been on treatment the longest. The Clinton Foundation's donation of paediatric ARV drugs and technical inputs greatly supported the implementation of the National Paediatric ART Program. GFATM Round 4 China AIDS Project supported the implementation of paediatric treatment evaluation and drug resistance screening among paediatric patients. Over the past 20 years, China has made use of the flexibility of foreign resource to encourage and emphasize involvement of CBOs in HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities by actively supporting and facilitating CBO development through providing funds and technical support. The professional guidance relationship between China's Ministry of Health and international NGOs, including CHAI and BMGF, was established creating a new aspect of civil cooperation in foreign affairs. With the support of international cooperation projects, domestic CBOs are continually developing, growing and contributing to domestic HIV/AIDS prevention and control work. The number of CBOs has increased dramatically from a dozen in 1990 to several hundred in 2009. There were 357 CBOs registered to participate in the GFATM China Country Coordinating Mechanism development in 2009.ii18 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY Establishing a platform for communication and experience sharing with the international community The implementation of international cooperation projects has established a platform of communication and cooperation between China and other countries. Through the support of international cooperation projects, China's National AIDS Reference Laboratory (NARL) has been strengthened. The reference laboratory passed the international quality control and quality assurance certification tests relating to STI/HIV/ AIDS in 2008. The China Integrated Program for Research on AIDS (CIPRA), a joint collaboration with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH)/ National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) from 2002 to 2008, has pursued research in behavioural interventions, viral immunity, clinical management and vaccine research through research projects in China. The research project has generated 101 articles published in peer-reviewed journals.",
