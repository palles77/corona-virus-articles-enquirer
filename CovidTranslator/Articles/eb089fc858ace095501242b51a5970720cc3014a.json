In April 2016, there were more than 120,000 waiting list candidates and just over 1000 donors. 2 According to the United Network for Organ Sharing website, solid organs in most demand are kidneys, with more than 100,000 patients on the waiting list, closely followed by almost 15,000 people waiting for livers. 2 There are approximately 4000 candidates waiting for a heart transplant and a little over 1000 candidates waiting for lung and pancreas transplants. 2 The number of donors for kidney and liver transplantation has increased over the past 5 years, possibly owing to increased living donor transplants. Five-year survival rates for kidney transplant recipients are roughly 75% and for liver transplant recipients it is around 70%. 3 Transplant recipients are at risk of complications related to surgical procedures, immunosuppressive therapy, and infection. 4 Infection remains the most common complication after SOT. 1, 4, 5 This article discusses infections in SOT recipients including those with kidney, heart, lungs, and pancreas transplants.",

Factors affecting the incidence of infection after SOT include the type of organ transplanted, anatomic region of transplant, incidence of surgical complications, level of immunosuppression, and antirejection therapy. 4 Limited high-level evidence exists about the epidemiology and risk factors for early nosocomial infections in SOT recipients; however, the third edition of the American Society of Transplantation Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Complications of Solid Organ Transplantation offers a guide for clinical practice by providing evidence where it exists and clinical consensus where critically appraised evidence is limited. 4 Many of the classic clinical markers and inflammatory signs and symptoms associated with infection are diminished in SOT recipients owing to immunosuppression; therefore, usual indicators such as fever, leukocytosis, and wound erythema are not always appreciated. 3 Additionally, usual pain pathways may be disrupted owing to altered anatomy and organ denervation affecting recognition of infection, and subsequently delaying diagnosis and increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality. 3 Transplant recipients are particularly susceptible to infection during episodes of increased immunosuppression and should be observed closely for signs of infection. 3 Traditional testing methods to seek infectious sources may be limited in the diagnosis of acute disease after transplant because bacterial and fungal cultures often have lower yields and radiographs are often insufficient for diagnosing infections. 3 ",
