Preparedness efforts are hampered by considerable uncertainty about the nature and intensity of human-to-human transmission, with previous reproduction number estimates ranging from 0.4 to 1.5. Here we synthesize epidemiological data and transmission models for the MERS-CoV outbreak during April-October 2013 to resolve uncertainties in epidemic risk, while considering the impact of observation bias. We match the progression of MERS-CoV cases in 2013 to a dynamic transmission model that incorporates community and hospital compartments, and distinguishes transmission by zoonotic (index) cases and secondary cases. When observation bias is assumed to account for the fact that all reported zoonotic cases are severe, but only \u223c57% of secondary cases are symptomatic, the average reproduction number of MERS-CoV is estimated to be 0.45 (95% CI:0.29-0.61). Alternatively, if these epidemiological observations are taken at face value, index cases are estimated to transmit substantially more effectively than secondary cases, (R i = 0.84 (0.58-1.20) vs R s = 0.36 (0.24-0.51)). In both scenarios the relative contribution of hospital-based transmission is over four times higher than that of community transmission, indicating that disease control should be focused on hospitalized patients.",

More information on the observation process is needed to clarify whether MERS-CoV is intrinsically weakly transmissible between people or whether existing control measures have contributed meaningfully to reducing the transmissibility of secondary cases. Our results could help evaluate the progression of MERS-CoV in recent months in response to changes in disease surveillance, control interventions, or viral adaptation.",

Meanwhile, there is considerable uncertainty about the extent of human-to-human transmission and it is unclear whether MERS-CoV has the potential for epidemic spread.

If R < 1 then infections occur in isolated clusters as self-limited chains of transmission, and persistence of the disease requires continued animal-to-human infections (Anderson and May, 1991) . When averaged over all reported cases, two recent studies have estimated an overall R (denoted R overall ) to be in a range of 0.42-0.92 (Breban et al., 2013; Cauchemez et al., 2014) , thus diminishing the concern of MERS-CoV epidemic spread. In contrast, when R is evaluated for just the index cases originating from animal-to-human transmission, estimates (denoted R i ) can be as high as 1.5 (Cauchemez et al., 2014) , suggesting that epidemic spread is possible.",

One possibility is that secondary (human-to-human) cases transmit less than index cases, either because of intrinsic biological differences, or because of less effective control measures for index cases relative to secondary cases. A second possibility is that the transmission potential of index and secondary cases is similar, but many weakly transmitting index cases are unobserved. The tendency to identify and report larger clusters (whose index case cause a higher than average number of new cases) would lead to an overestimation of R i (Ferguson et al., 2004; Blumberg and Lloyd-Smith, 2013a,b; Farrington et al., 2003; Rimoin et al., 2010) . It is important to evaluate both possibilities, because the optimal utilization of public health resources depends on the relative transmission potential of primary and secondary cases.",

In order to relate case observation to disease severity we also distinguish cases that are sick enough to become hospitalized from those who are treated entirely in the community. We use a Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo estimation technique to match our model with observed MERS-CoV 2013 case data, provide estimates of the reproduction number, and revisit earlier estimates (Breban et al., 2013; Cauchemez et al., 2014) through the lens of reporting bias.

We minimized the \"sum of square errors\" between the corresponding model outputs and observed case counts for each of the three transmission settings (reservoir, community, hospital). We used a delayed rejection adaptive Metropolis-Hastings (DRAM) algorithm in a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) framework which has been previously described in ref. (Haario et al., 2006) (Matlab package available from: http://helios.fmi.fi/\u223clainema/mcmc/). We assumed uniform prior distributions for \u02db, \u02c7 and l with broad ranges (Table 1) . We allowed the algorithm to run for 10,000 iterations with an initial burn-in of 5000 iterations to allow runs to reach a stationary regime. The Geweke diagnostic method was employed to assess convergence of chains (Geweke, 1992) , with values close to 1 deemed satisfactory. Posterior distributions for each parameter were obtained from the underlying joint posterior distribution of resulting Markov chains. Since our study period starts with a large hospital outbreak, the outbreak simulation was initialized with one initial spillover case (i.e., I i (0) = 1) and also included a low number of exposed secondary cases (i.e. E s (0) = 5). Parameter estimates were not sensitive to these initial conditions. Sensitivity analyses were performed by varying parameters defining the natural history of the disease (Table 1 ) and by fitting cumulative numbers of daily cases using interpolated onset dates, instead of final outbreak size data.",

We then adjust previously reported estimates of R i and R overall (Breban et al., 2013; Cauchemez et al., 2014) to incorporate the negligible transmission of unobserved cases (see supporting Text S2 for details). In this framework, setting c,i = 1, corresponds to taking the previous results at face value and is most similar to our differential transmission model (scenario B).

For illustration, Fig. 6 shows the predicted effects of control interventions (targeting community-based or hospital-based transmission, via parameter l), pathogen adaptation to humans (i.e, increase in baseline transmission rate, \u02c7), and potential increases in reservoir spillover rate (via parameter \u02db), relative to the baseline 'surveillance bias' scenario A.",

When these estimates are combined, the 95% confidence interval for these reproduction numbers spans 0.42-0.92. In their model, the inferred value for R i is also 0.42-0.92, because no distinction between R i and R overall is made. Cauchemez et al.

First, although some of the models include the possibility that R i > 1, none of them suggest that R overall > 1. This argues against the possibility that MERS-CoV is self-sustaining in humans. Rather, continual introduction from a non-human reservoir is needed for persistence. However, because some models predict R i > 1, it is unclear whether the lack of endemic spread is due to effective control interventions or intrinsically weak human-to-human transmissibility. Second, when observation bias is incorporated into parameter estimation, the range of possible values for both R i and R overall shift to smaller values. This may appear counter-intuitive because the existence of unobserved cases might suggest that transmission was under-estimated previously. This apparent paradox is a result of our assumption that asymptomatic index cases (rather than secondary cases) are the least likely to be observed. 6 .

However, rather than accepting the possibility of surveillance bias as a limitation of our study, our analysis has explicitly incorporated its potential impact, while also considering an alternative 'transmission bias' scenario where observations are taken at face value. When we incorporate the possibility that less severe index cases are unobserved, the range of possible reproduction numbers in our study and previously published models (Breban et al., 2013; Cauchemez et al., 2014) shifts to smaller values (Fig. 7) . Since convergence of our model to data is high in both the 'surveillance bias' scenario and 'differential transmission' scenarios, further information is needed to tease out the extent to which observation bias operated in 2013 and beyond. For example, targeted serological studies in communities where index cases have been reported could shed light on the fraction of index cases that may be unobserved. Further, it would be helpful to know more about the MERS-CoV surveillance process in Saudi Arabia, and determine whether individual cases were detected because they self-reported to a health center or were actively discovered via contact tracing of a severe case. More information on standards of clinical practice would also be helpful, such as the probability that a patient who presents with milder symptoms to a health care facility would be diagnosed with MERS-CoV.

Besides the two transmission scenarios considered in this study (black and gray dots), the plot includes results of Breban et al. (2013) and Cauchemez et al. (2014) . The key distinction among the models are that Breban et al. (2013) modeled primary and secondary transmission as being similar; Cauchemez et al. (2014) used the timing of cases to estimate R i ; our differential transmission model accounts for the higher observed disease severity of index cases; and our surveillance bias model considers the possibility that all weakly transmitting and asymptomatic index cases are unobserved. A modified version of Breban et al. and Cauchemez et al. are also shown in the plot that compensate for the possibility of unobserved index cases and thus allow direct comparison to our surveillance bias model. Cauchemez et al.' s results are presented as a confidence region because their inference of R overall was separate from their inference of R i . All the other models contain an intrinsic dependence between R overall and R i and so these results are presented as a curve. respiratory tract and cause severe pneumonia (de Wit et al., 2013; Franks et al., 2003) . Both infections are considered severe, especially among older adults with underlying medical conditions (Assiri et al., 2013b; Donnelly et al., 2003) . Our findings indicate that the transmissibility MERS-CoV in secondary cases remained well below the epidemic threshold in Saudi Arabia in 2013, ensuring that all human-to-human transmission chains go extinct (Ferguson et al., 2004) . At the time of this writing, there was not enough resolution in MERS-CoV phylogenetic data to assess whether transmission was only endemic in the animal reservoir or could persist in humans (Cauchemez et al., 2014) . Based on our synthesis of epidemiological data and existing models, we argue that the transmission potential of MERS-CoV is currently low based on the progression of the 2013 outbreak, and on the same order as that of other stage III viral zoonoses such as influenza A/H5N1, monkeypox or Nipah virus, although much higher than that of influenza A/H7N9 (Blumberg and Lloyd-Smith, 2013a,b; Chowell et al., 2013) . In contrast, the reproduction number for SARS was estimated to be \u223c2-3 during the pre-intervention period (Riley et al., 2003; Lipsitch et al., 2003) . Although our study cannot speak to the dynamics of the recent resurgence of cases in Spring 2014, it is reassuring that disease transmission remained limited to the Arabian Peninsula throughout June 2014. Indeed, chains of transmission initiated by infected travelers returning to Europe, Africa, Asia and North America have remained extremely short (Cauchemez et al., 2014) .",

If R i happened to be greater than one, it is then essential to understand why R s was less than one. One possibility is that control interventions around identified secondary cases were particularly effective in 2013. If this were the case, it is imperative to identify which of these interventions were most effective so that they can be rapidly implemented in the event that MERS-CoV spreads to a new geographic region. A similar situation arose in the last days of smallpox eradication, as stringent control measures were put in place once cases were identified, limiting the transmission of secondary cases (Fenner et al., 1988) . Alternatively, it may be that there is an intrinsically biological phenomenon in which humans infected by a zoonotic reservoir experience more clinically severe disease, and in turn a higher transmission potential than those infected by humans. In this case, further adaptation of MERS-CoV to humans would be required for sustainable transmission to occur. A definite identification of the reservoir for MERS-CoV would help to shed light on potential variation in doses and route of exposure between index and secondary cases, which may account for the observed differences in onward transmission.",

A key finding of our analysis was that the number of MERS-CoV cases caused by hospital-based transmission was 4.3 to 4.6-fold higher than community-based transmission and estimates were robust to a variety of sensitivity analysis. These findings are reminiscent of SARS (Varia et al., 2003; Lau et al., 2004; Tambyah et al., 2003) and indicate that more stringent hospital control measures would be particularly effecting at reducing transmission. The reasons for increased hospital transmission could include increased intensity and duration of viral shedding, or increased contacts with particularly vulnerable patients (Seto et al., 2003; Chowell et al., 2004) . Understanding the MERS-CoV transmission process in the hospital is particularly important in light of recent reports of widespread infection among camels in North Africa (Chu et al., 2014) , where low-resources could make surveillance and hospital control measures far harder to implement.",

First, we assumed that the rate of zoonotic introductions into the human populations was constant. This assumption may be reasonable if MERS-CoV prevalence level in the zoonotic reservoir has reached an endemic state and the rate of animal-to-human contacts was stable throughout our study period. Similarly, we have not attempted to quantify changes in the baseline transmission rate or the relative transmissibility of hospitalized cases over time, but we fit our model solely to cases that occurred when pro-active surveillance was implemented in Saudi Arabia (Memish et al., 2014) . Further, we assume that asymptomatic cases do not transmit infection. However, given that MERS-CoV secondary cases have typically been traceable to an index case it seems unlikely that there can be much asymptomatic transmission as this would lead to difficulty in reconstructing transmission chains. Another limitation of our model is that parameters \u02c7 and l were not uniquely identified, although we were able to find reasonably well-bounded estimates of R. This is not entirely surprising, as a similar phenomenon occurs when a simple SIR model is fitted to the early exponential phase of an epidemic. In such a simple model, both \u02c7 (the transmission rate) and (the recovery rate) are not identifiable. Yet, the ratio beta/gamma = R 0 is often identifiable in practice.",

Although our model assumes homogeneous mixing within community and hospital populations, our results did not warrant further model heterogeneity given limited available data. As more data become available, these assumptions could be refined particularly if the pathogen's intrinsic transmissibility increases or if the virus spreads to poor areas where nosocomial transmission may be amplified. An important issue in modeling outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula is the lack of information on age-and gender-specific contact rate patterns, as it has been done for European countries (Lee et al., 2003) . Finally, we did not consider the progression of more recent cases of MERS-CoV reported after October 2013, to maintain comparability with previous transmission studies (Breban et al., 2013; Cauchemez et al., 2014) .",

However, as with all emerging zoonoses, the potential for viral adaptation towards increased transmissibility is a real threat that needs careful monitoring. We have highlighted how observation bias (particularly the difficulty in observing asymptomatic and less severe index cases) can skew the inference and interpretation of transmission parameters. In particular, more data on the surveillance process is needed so that the transmission potential of index cases can be more rigorously ascertained both retrospectively and in the on-going 2014 outbreak. The relative transmissibility of primary and secondary cases has important implications for the efficacy of current control measures and the potential for spread in other regions that are more resource-limited. As a focal point of control, we have found that over 80% of transmission events are likely occurring in a hospital setting. We hope that future surveillance efforts can elucidate specific mechanisms of hospital-based transmission and effective control so that targeted interventions can be rapidly implemented if MERS-CoV spreads globally or adapts to humans.",
