Description Logics (DLs) are suitable, well-known logics for managing structured knowledge that have gained considerable attention the last decade. The current research progress and the existing problems of uncertain or imprecise knowledge representation and reasoning in DLs are analyzed in this paper. An integration between the theories of fuzzy DLs and rough DLs has been attempted by providing fuzzy rough DLs based on fuzzy rough set theory. The syntax, semantics and properties of fuzzy rough DLs are given. It is proved that the satisfiability, subsumption, entailment and ABox consistency reasoning in fuzzy rough DLs may be reduced to the ABox consistency reasoning in the corresponding fuzzy DLs.",

            "text": "Description Logics (DLs) [3] are a class of knowledge representation formalisms in the tradition of semantic networks and frames, which can be used to represent the terminological knowledge of an application domain in a structured and formally well-understood way. DL systems provide their users with inference services (like computing the subsumption hierarchy) that deduce implicit knowledge from the explicitly represented knowledge. They are employed in various application domains, such as semantic Web [56] , ontologies [2] , databases [12] , and software engineering [6] . Because classical DLs [3] can only represent and reason on certain or precise knowledge, and cannot represent and reason on uncertain or imprecise knowledge, therefore, some researchers extend classical DLs allowing to express uncertain or imprecise knowledge [45] . To cope with this problem, a number of extended DLs, e.g., fuzzy DLs [58, 60] , rough DLs [34, 54] , probabilistic DLs [31, 44] and possibilistic DLs [24, 53] , have been put forward which extend classical DLs with uncertainty or imprecision. Some of them deal with the vagueness aspect while others deal with the uncertainty aspect. In this paper we will study fuzzy DLs and rough DLs.",

It has shown enormous promise in handling uncertainties to a reasonable extent, particularly in decision-making models under different kinds of risks, subjective judgment, vagueness, and ambiguity [5] . After nearly 20 years since the introduction of fuzzy sets, Pawlak [50] introduced the notion of a rough set as a new mathematical tool to deal with the approximation of a concept in the context of inexact, or incomplete information [5, 30] . Since the introduction of rough set theory, many attempts to establish the relationships between the two theories, to compare each to the other, and to simultaneously hybridize them have been made, the aim being to develop a model of uncertainty stronger than both of them [13, 18, 19, 38, 43, 52, 67, 68] . For example, Dubois and Prade were one of the first who investigated the problem of fuzzification of a rough set, and presented a kind of fuzzy rough set theory based on a fuzzy similarity relation (i.e., reflexive, symmetric and transitive fuzzy relation) [18] . Pei and Wu et al. presented a kind of generalized fuzzy rough set theory based on an arbitrary fuzzy relation [52, 67] . Liu proposed the notion of generalized rough sets over fuzzy lattices [43] .",

            "text": "At present there are mainly two approaches to the rough set-based extensions of DL, i.e., the RDL approach in [54] and the ROTEL approach in [42] . From the syntax point of view, for the former, the alphabet of RDL is the same as that of the underlying DL and only the formation rules of concepts are extended; however, the latter approach extends the alphabet of the underlying DL with a set of indiscernibility roles {E 1 , E 2 , ... , E k }, and the approximate concepts are defined as [E]C and E C, moreover, new role terms [E]R and E R are also defined, where E is an indiscernibility role, C is a concept, and R is a role term. Therefore, the ROTEL approach will allow much more flexibility and expressivity on the language side than the RDL approach. For example, role terms [E]R and E R are not expressible in the RDL approach. Since there exist new role terms such as [E]R and E R in the ROTEL approach (not included in classical DLs [3] and RDLs [54] ), so a new reasoning algorithm for the ROTEL approach must be provided. That is to say, the algorithm presented in [42] is essentially an extension of tableau algorithm of classical DLs [3] , i.e., the proposed completion rules are extensions of the classical rules. Concretely, [E]C-rule, E C-rule, [E]R-rule, E R-rule, ReflC-rule, ReflR-rule, Tran-rule, and Cong-rule are added to the completion rules. These rules are essentially introduced to deal with properties of equivalence relations and concept terms (or role terms) not included classical DLs [3] . Therefore, we have to implement a new reasoner for the satisfiability of RCT (rough concept theory) in [42] . However, the RDL approach extends classical DLs by two modal-like operators, called the lower and upper approximations. It is proved that the satisfiability reasoning in rough DLs may be reduced to the satisfiability reasoning in classical DLs through a translation function [54] . In this paper we proved that the satisfiability, subsumption, entailment and ABox consistency reasoning in FRDLs may be reduced to the ABox consistency reasoning in the corresponding fuzzy DLs through a translation function defined above in this paper (see Theorems 5 and 6). In other words, we do not provide a new tableau algorithm for the reasoning of rough DLs or fuzzy rough DLs, however, we present a translation function from rough DLs (or FRDLs) to classical DLs (or fuzzy DLs). Lastly, the works of [42, 54] are different from this paper. Concretely, literatures [42, 54] study rough DLs, however, this paper studies FRDLs.",

When constructing a two-dimensional FRDL, a number of design decisions have to be made. For example, one has to choose a concrete FDL and a RDL to be combined. Regarding the FDL part, some important decisions are whether to apply the number restrictions [4, 65] , nominals [11, 65] , inverse roles [11, 27] and concrete domains [46, 47] to DL concepts, and whether to apply the role hierarchies [27] and GCIs [28] to DL TBoxes, and whether to apply the reflexive role axioms, symmetric role axioms and transitive role axioms [25, 27] to DL RBoxes. Regarding the RDL part, an important decision is which fuzzy rough set theory [15, 18, 19, 32, 43, 52, 67] is applied to DLs.

To the best of our knowledge, at present only one DL, i.e., SROIQ [25] , supports the reflexive roles, symmetric roles and transitive roles simultaneously, and no any fuzzy DL supports reflexive fuzzy roles, symmetric fuzzy roles and transitive fuzzy roles. Consequently, in order to present the C-FRDLs, we must extend the DL SROIQ with fuzzy capabilities, i.e., provide the fuzzy DL FSROIQ based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic which was presented by Zadeh [72] firstly.

Technically, FRDLs can be simulated with the corresponding fuzzy DLs without added expressiveness. For example, FRSHIN can be simulated with the fuzzy DL FSHIN without added expressiveness. In other words, our FRDLs are strictly speaking not more expressive than fuzzy DLs such as FSHIN, i.e., the fuzzy DLs are strong enough to cope with notions arising from rough approximations, but the fuzzy approximation concepts that we introduce are useful modeling devices for uncertain or imprecise knowledge (namely non-crisp concepts) such as SARS (see Section 3).",

The reason is that, in rough DLs such as RDL [54] , for every concept C \u2208 RDL, the corresponding lower approximation C and upper approximation C also are concepts of RDL, i.e., C and C are two different separate concepts. Moreover, C and C can be translated into equivalent concepts of classical DLs. Therefore, rough DLs and classical DLs have same expressive power. However, it is well known that when it is impossible to formally define a concept C, we can often make use of the approximations (the lower approximation C and the upper approximation C) together, i.e., approximate concept (or rough set) C, C , to express the concept C in a precise way with explicit formal semantics, in other words, only single lower approximation C or upper approximation C cannot express the concept C in a precise way. In order to deal with this case, approximate concepts (or rough sets) have to be introduced to rough DLs. At this aspect, Jiang et al. [34] present a kind of new rough DL RDL AC based on approximate concepts. Here rough DLs based on approximate concept are the extensions of the corresponding classical DLs. Similarly with the rough DLs, FRDLs can also be extended based on fuzzy approximate concepts (or fuzzy rough sets), i.e., FRDLs based on fuzzy approximate concepts (FRDL AC s for short) can be presented.",

Nevertheless, most of the works such as this paper in fuzzy DLs rely on the semantics of fuzzy set operators proposed by Zadeh [72] : G\u00f6del conjunction and disjunction, Lukasiewicz negation and Kleene-Dienes implication.

Hence, we can use the DeLorean system to implement the reasoning of the FRDLs such as FRSROIQ under Zadeh semantics. On the other hand, Bobillo et al. [7, 8] also show that a fuzzy SROIQ fuzzy knowledge base (KB) can be reduced into a crisp KB, and the procedure preserves reasoning under Zadeh semantics. Therefore, existing reasoners such as FaCT++ [66] and Pellet [57] could also be applied to the reasoning of the FRDLs such as FRSROIQ under Zadeh semantics.",

Although our FRDLs are strictly speaking not more expressive than fuzzy DLs, the fuzzy approximation concepts that we introduce are useful modeling devices for uncertain or imprecise knowledge. We have shown that the satisfiability, subsumption, entailment and ABox consistency reasoning in FRDLs may be reduced to the ABox consistency reasoning in the corresponding fuzzy DLs, which gives us access to reasoning infrastructure.",

Several negation functions have been given in the literature, e.g., Lukasiewicz negation c(a) = 1 \u2212 a and G\u00f6del negation c(0) = 1 and c(a) = 0 if a > 0.

These functions are usually called norm operations referred to as t-norms (t : [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1]), in the case of fuzzy intersection, and t-conorms (or s-norms) (u : [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1]), in the case of fuzzy union",

But, from R B, AB C D, by the interpretation of C D, \u2200d \u2208 I , C I (d I ) D I (d I ). By the proof of Theorem 2, we have (C t ) I (d I ) = C I (d I ) and (D t ) I (d I ) = D I (d I ). Since (C t ) I (a I ) n and (D t ) I (a I ) < n, then we have C I (d I ) n and D I (d I ) < n. This is an obvious contradiction to C I (d I ) D I (d I ).",
