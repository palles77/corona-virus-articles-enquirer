Etiotropic drugs cannot effectively control infectious diseases therefore, there is a dire need to explore alternative strategies especially those based on the regulation of immune system. The review discusses all rational approaches to develop better understanding towards immunotherapeutic strategies based on modulation of immune system in an attempt to curb the elevating risk of infectious diseases such as HIV, HPV and HSV because of their high prevalence. Development of monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and several other immune based treatments are promising alternative strategies that are offering new opportunities to eradicate pathogens.",

Though, antimicrobial drugs have developed rapidly in recent past but these drugs are of narrow spectrum and target certain groups of microbes leading to an increased resistance. Such hindrances in treatment compel scientists to investigate new ways of developing effective and cost-effective treatments especially immunotherapies [1] . The alarming increase in prevalence of immunocompromised people besides booming antimicrobial resistance and lack of novel antimicrobial agents form the basis of development of immunotherapeutic strategies. Frequently used immune-based therapies against infectious diseases span the use of cytokines and growth factors to boost natural immunity, increase effector cell response to restrain infectious diseases, introduction of antibodies against different organisms, use of monoclonal antibodies, hyperimmuneglobulins, cytokines, different interleukins and interferon [2, 3] .",

There are several different types of immune responses evolved qualitatively to avoid infections e.g., different subsets of T helper cells (e.g., TH1, TH2 and TH17), TFH (follicular helper T cells) [12] that secrete IL-21 (interleukin-21) and differentiates B cells to generate memory B cells [13] . In addition, memory T cells consist of distinct populations of effector memory cells and central memory cells both having distinct effector function along with homing capacity [14] . The mammalian immune system includes innate and adaptive components, which cooperate to protect the host against microbial infections. Innate immunity sense microbes using patternrecognition receptors [15] , like C-type lectin-like receptors [16] , toll-like receptors [15] , cytosolic nod-like receptors [17] , and RIG-I-like receptors [18] , which trigger the activation of adaptive immune response and antimicrobial responses. The adaptive immune system, in turn, activates innate effector mechanisms in an antigen-specific manner. Several different subsets of functionally distinct dendritic cells are also present and it has now been proved that pattern-recognition receptors and dendritic cells determine the quality and magnitude of acquired immunity [19, 20] . Foreign agent or microbe is integrated by dendritic cells and translated to antigen specific B and T cells to boost the strength, persistence, and quality of the adaptive immune response [19] .",

Rabbit anti-Rabies virus Glycoprotein G polyclonal antibody (Catalog Number: CSB-PA14899A0Rb) induces the endocytosis of virion because this polyclonal antibody cause attachment of the virus to host cellular receptors. This fusion triggered by acidic pH of endosome leads to conformational changes in the glycoprotein trimer. This transmembrane glycoprotein is the viral attachment protein that promotes uptake of virus by infected cells, and acts as target of the host humoral immune response to infection [36, 37] . Only two individuals developed rabies out of total 7660 Filipino recipients of F (ab 0 )2 equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG), (Favirab, Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France). As per WHO guidelines none of them had given post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) strictly [38, 39] . There are limited therapeutic options available against viruses therefore polyclonal serum therapy will very soon be emerged as potent and effective technique against viral infections based on several researches and clinical studies that have demonstrated the effectiveness of animal-derived polyclonal antibody based treatments targeting different venoms, toxins and infections [40] . Currently, immunoglobulin therapy is targeting HPA1 (highly pathogenic avian influenza) viruses e.g., H7N9 and H5N1 are new targets for polyclonal F(ab 0 )2 immunoglobulin therapy. In mice, in vivo proof-of-concept studies of equine polyclonal F(ab 0 )2 to HPAI H5N1 (Highly pathogenic avian influenze-H5N1) have been found to prevent infection after an intranasal HPAI H5N1 attack [41] . According to another study, both prior (prophylaxis) or post (therapeutic) administration of four pepsin digested immunoglobulin H5N1 avian influenza equine F(ab 0 )2 preparations exhibited cytopathic effect against H5N1 infected cultured MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells and provided protection to mice [42] . In another study, 100% survival rate was observed in influenza-infected-mice that was intravenously infused with high dose 320 lg) of anti-influenza IgG [43] . No serious adverse events were observed in phase 1 clinical trial carried out in 21-40 years old, 16 healthy human males who were injected with polyclonal F(ab 0 )2 to HPAI H5N1 [44] . Likewise, many animal based studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of polyclonal antibody therapy against various neglected tropical viral diseases. Unimmunized hamsters injected with West Nile Virus-immune hamster antisera (1 h before and 24 h after a West Nile Virus challenge) were protected from life-threatening West Nile Virus infection [45] . Decrease in disease and deaths were noticed when Marburg and Ebola filoviruses challenged non-human primates were injected with Marburg and Ebola filoviruses specific polyclonal antibodies obtained from non-human primates who had survived flavoviruses exposure [46] . Likewise, similar results were obtained when Ebola infected mice, guinea pigs, and monkeys were injected with polyclonal sera acquired from Ebola immunized mice [47, 48] . Equine F (ab 0 )2 have been found effective in both hamsters and mice infected with SARS-CoV infection because a significant reduction in lung viral titres was observed compared to controls [49] .",

HIV infection is associated with progressive exhaustion of CD4+ T cells due to their enhanced destruction and diminished production [61] . With CD4+ T cells, HIV replication leads to cell death, syncytium formation and persistent infection thus creating reservoirs for the virus in many cells and tissues [58] . About 78 million people have suffered from HIV virus and 39 million have died since the beginning of this epidemic [62] . It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing world. In 2002, the global prevalence of HIV was 31 million which was increased to 35\u00c13 million in 2012. About 1.5 million deaths were reported in 2013 but the incidence is now decreasing due to expanded access to antiretroviral therapy [61] . Since last many years patients of HIV have been treated with cART (combined antiretroviral therapy) i.e., use of several antiretroviral drugs which suppress the replication of virus but virus is not completely eradicated therefore, trends are now shifting towards practice of immune based treatments. Other limitations associated with combined antiretroviral therapy are transmission of drug resistant HIV strains, emergence of multidrug resistance and cART does not always restore normal CD4+ T cell counts [63] .",

To date, RV144 is the only vaccine that has shown some degree of efficacy [67] . Modest efficacy against HIV acquisition was observed in Thai Phase III clinical trial of RV144. Antibody responses against HIV-1 gp120 envelope (Env) were observed in plasma obtained from HIV-1uninfected individuals administered with ALVAC-HIV (vCP1521) prime and AIDSVAX B/E boost. Peptide microarray analysis from six HIV-1 subtypes and group M consensus exhibited that vaccination triggered antibody responses to the V2 loop or second variable of gp120 of multiple subtypes. V2 responses were further evaluated by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance using linear and cyclic V2 loop peptides. Antibody responses against cyclic V2 at 2 weeks postimmunization were noticed in about 97% of vaccinated individuals. RV144 vaccination triggered antibodies that targeted a region of the second loop consisting of conserved epitopes. Early transmission events of HIV-1 involve second loop interactions and supports the evidence that in RV144 anti-V2 antibodies may contribute to viral inhibition [68] .",

Phase 3 trials are being studied currently. Forty-eight long-term HIV-1 infected people with suppressed viral loads because of antiretroviral therapy (cART) were injected with Tat Oyi vaccine preparation. The clinical outcome of this phase I/IIa trial showed decrease in the extent of HIV RNA rebound after cART interruption. This study shows that Tat vaccine protects and activates HIV-infected cell in vitro [83] . Combined treatment of Tat Oyi vaccine and cART has found to increase CD4+ T-cell numbers. Phase III studies that has been conducted in South Africa (Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01513135) unfolded that Tat vaccination induces cross-clade neutralizing anti-Tat antibodies in patients with different infecting viruses and belonging to different genetic backgrounds [84] .",

A research study based on hematopoietic stem progenitor cell (HSPC) approach reported the use of protective CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) to engineer immunity in HIV infected patients. CAR-modified HSPCs cells (Chimeric antigen receptor modified hematopoietic stem progenitor cell) differentiate into functional T cells along with natural killer cells which were resistant to HIV infection leading to cessation of HIV replication.

            "text": "HIV infection is associated with cytokine production. Such cytokines influence viral replication and regulate immune system thus, contribute towards the progression of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Several cytokines involved in immune regulation exert opposite effects, like some stimulate cellular immune function and others induce production of antibodies. AIDS is characterized by diverse disturbances and imbalances in the regulation of cytokine expression. Different cytokines affect expression and replication of HIV differently [88] . Production of T-helper type 1 (Th1) cytokines e.g., antiviral interferon-c, interleukin-2 (IL-2) are decreased whereas T-helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines e.g., interleukin-1, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, tumor necrosis factor are increased. IFN-a, IFN-b and IL-16, which inhibit HIV-1 replication in T cells and MDM (monocyte derived macrophages), and IL-10 and IL-13, which inhibit HIV-1 in monocyte derived macrophage act as HIV-suppressor cytokines. TNF-a, TNF-p, IL-1 and IL-6, which trigger HIV-1 replication in MDM and T cells, macrophagecolony stimulating factor, which stimulates HIV-1 in MDM and IL2, IL-7 and IL-15 which provoke HIV-1 in T cells act as HIVinductive cytokines. IFN-c, IL-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor act as bifunctional cytokines because of both inhibitory and stimulatory impacts on HIV-1 infection [89] [90] [91] . Therefore, cytokine therapy may suggest new ways to prevent progression to AIDS. HIV-1 patients experience significant decline in CD4 + T cells but IL-2 therapy has been shown to improve CD4 + counts [92] the findings of this study were in contrast to previous studies which suggested that IL-2 had no supplementary benefits in HIV-1 patients [93] . Levy et al. have also demonstrated considerable rise in CD4 cells in HIV-1 infected individuals administered with IL-2 in combination with highly active antiretroviral therapy. Na\u00efve and memory CD4 cells count, natural killer cells, lymphocyte expression of CD25 and CD28 was higher in IL-2 group compared to controls [94] . Administration of IL-7 in HIV-1 infected individuals led to expansion of CD4 + , CD8 + T cells, and IL-7 receptor alpha chain CD127 + . rhIL-7 amplify the numbers of na\u00efve and central memory T cells [95] . Marked decrease in the production of virus-induced interferon (IFN)-a [96] and interferon-a producing cells (IPCs) has been observed in HIV patients. This study suggested a direct link of interferon-a producing cells (IPCs) with control of HIV replication [97] . Phase II/III study showed lower rate of HIV progression in 40 of 122 IFN-a vaccine recipients [98] . Another study involving 34 patients of asymptomatic HIV infection administered with IFN-a showed decrease in HIV load. Of the 32 study patients followed after study (range, 5-33 months), no patients in the IFN-a group developed an AIDS compared with 5 patients in the placebo group [99] .",

Whereas, regulatory (suppressor) T cells and Th2 cytokines (e.g., interleukin-10 [IL-10]) down regulate this immune profile thereby, allowing the establishment of recurrent disease and replication of reactivated virus. Therefore, an efficacious vaccine must stimulate Th1 immunity and be defective in Th2 cytokine production especially IL-10 [157] .
