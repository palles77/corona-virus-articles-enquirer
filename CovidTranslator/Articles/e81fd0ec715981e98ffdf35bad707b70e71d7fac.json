Two groups (A and B), each comprising three dogs, were inoculated with G. duodenalis trophozoites and cysts, respectively. A third group of two dogs was not inoculated and remained as control. After inoculation feces were collected daily to determine the pre-patent period, by flotation in 33% zinc sulfate solution. Blood samples (5 mL) were collected from animals at 15-day intervals during the 165 days of the experimental period and were used to carry out the hemogram and biochemical evaluation of the levels of total protein, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, urea and creatinine. A prepatent period was observed at 5-6 days post-inoculation (p.i.) in the inoculated dogs, with cysts eliminated for approximately 3 months. No alterations were seen in the clinical parameters evaluated. Anemia was observed at 15 p.i. in the inoculated dogs. The mean eosinophil count of inoculated groups was higher than that of the control ( p 0.05) but none of the biochemical parameters analyzed presented significant differences. The results of this study show that G. duodenalis from human isolates is able to infect dogs with minimal systemic manifestations without producing clinical signs of giardiasis. #",

Bemrick (1963) noted that the cysts apparently disappeared spontaneously and this may be characteristic natural behavior of the parasite. This behavior may explain false-negative diagnoses or under-estimations. Bemrick (1963) noted that although some animals may develop persistent infections and the possibility of re-infection cannot be rejected. In this study it should be emphasized that hygiene, water quality, food and environmental conditions were controlled throughout the experimental period, to avoid contamination and re-infection. Zajac et al. (1992) observed experimentally infected dogs to be positive after treatment and suggested that they suppressed parasite levels, with latent potential for recrudescence of infection. However, the possibility of re-infection cannot be rejected. In this case, it is possible that treatment eliminates infection but does not confer immunity.",

However clinical giardiasis is reported and is associated with dogs (Leib and Zajac, 1995) .

There is no information in the literature on deficiencies in iron, Vitamin B12 and folic acid in dogs with giardiasis. The profile of anemia and the lower mean values of group A in relation to the other groups may be related to the type of inoculum administered and/or the numbers of the form inoculated, which could result in the development of pathogenicity. Another possibility is that a physical barrier was created between the intestinal epithelium and lumen, resulting from rapid multiplication of the trophozoites by binary fission and interfering with nutrient absorption (Faubert, 2000) .",

Although our results cannot be characterized as demonstrating absolute eosinophilia, the oscillations observed in groups A and B relative to the control may be associated with the presence of G. duodenalis, principally at 15 p.i., and thus concurrent with observed alterations in the erythrogram.
