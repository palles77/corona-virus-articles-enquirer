The majority of these infections in children are of viral etiology. In this study, we evaluated the incidence of viral ARI among children in Lebanon. Patients and Methods: Children presenting with symptoms of ARI were prospectively recruited between September 2009 to February 2012. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from patients and screened for 11 respiratory viruses using a multiplex Luminex-based PCR assay. Results: Two hundred twenty-one patients were recruited with a median age of 1 year (IQR: 0 -5). Out of 221 patients, 116 (52.5%) were positive for at least one virus, the majority (103/116; 88.8%) of which were in children under 6-year of age. Overall, 188 viruses were detected. Rhinovirus (RhV) was the most common virus detected in 81 (69.8%) patients followed by coxsackie virus and echovirus (CVEV) which were detected as one target in the panel in 45 (38.8%), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV types : 1, 2, 3, 4) in 24 (20.7%) patients. Coinfection with more than one virus was detected in 49 (42.9%) patients. RhV and CVEV were the most common viruses associated with co-infections and higher risk of rhinorrhea. Conclusions: Viral pathogens account for at least half of the ARIs in Lebanon, with a high frequency of co-infections being detected.",

Nair et al. estimated that 111 500 deaths in children <5 years were attributable to influenza-associated lower respiratory tract infections (LRI) in 2008, the vast majority of which occurred in developing countries. 10 RSV was estimated to have caused 33.8 million LRI episode in children under five, of which 3.4 million were severe causing up to 199 000 deaths. 11 In addition to the health burden of viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs), the economic impact is also high if we account for health care costs (direct cost) and loss of productivity (indirect cost). A study by Fendrik et al. estimated the total economic impact of non-influenzarelated viral RTIs in the United States at $40 billion annually. 12 The advancements that have been achieved in developing antiviral drugs, some of which have already been approved, against respiratory viruses allow for targeted therapy of viral ARIs. [13] [14] [15] This possibility calls for better and faster diagnosis of the etiologic agents in ARI patients to benefit from the full potential of these drugs. 6 Furthermore, ARIs are associated with the greatest amount of excess use of antibiotics that has led to unprecedented increase in antimicrobial drug resistance; 16, 17 therefore, proper and timely diagnosis of viral infections can help reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. 5, 6 In Lebanon, studies investigating the viral etiologies of ARIs are very scarce. In this study, we determined the viral etiologies among ARI patients at a tertiary care hospital that serves an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse patient population.",

Streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate was added, and mixtures were incubated at 52\u00b0C for a further 5 min before the addition of stop buffer. The samples were then analyzed on a Luminex Bio-Rad BioPlex 200 System (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using Bio-Rad BioPlex Manager software. The cutoff value for each target was determined, as previously described by Lia et al. 19 Statistical analysis. The data were checked for completeness, and responses were coded and entered into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 23 for Windows, which was later used for statistical analyses. 32 Descriptive statistics were presented to summarize the study variables of interest as counts and percentages for the categorical variables and as medians and Interquartile Range (IQR) for the continuous ones. The Chi-square test was used to calculate the association between two categorical variables. Pearson's chi-square analysis with Bonferroni-Holm p-value correction was used for multiple comparisons to assess infectivity enhancing correlations. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to determine which factors are associated with rhinorrhea. In the regression model, rhinorrhea was used as the dependent variable. Odds ratios and their respective 95% confidence intervals were calculated. For all analysis done, a pvalue of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

Almost half cases of Rhinovirus (50.6%) were positive for at least another virus in the panel. CVEV positive cases also had a high rate of coinfection (73%). Moreover, hMPV and INFB were detected in 9 samples, and all were co-infected. Table 3 summarizes the correlation of different viruses among our patients. Several correlations enhancing infectivity were evident in our analysis. Of note, RhV was the most frequently detected virus in co-infections and was significantly associated with RSVB, INFB, PIV3, hMPV, and CVEV.",

To simplify the analysis, we treated subtypes or genotypes of a virus as a single group (e.g. RSV for RSVA and RSVB, etc.). Having an underlying condition or receiving chemotherapy or a course of antibiotics were not found to be a risk factor for having a viral etiology or co-infection ( Table 2) . Additionally, we investigated the seasonal variation of viruses. Rhinovirus infections were detected throughout the year however the peak rate occurred during the main rainy months (November, December), likely for Coxsackie/Echovirus and RSV. On the other hand,Influenza A virus infections had a peak in the fall (September, October); (Figure 3 ). In terms of clinical symptoms, fever, cough and rhinorrhea were major symptoms observed in most of the patients infected with one or more respiratory virus ( Table 2) . Chisquare analysis revealed a significant correlation between rhinorrhea and INF, CVEV, and RhV and coinfection ( Table 2) . Bivariate logistic regression was then performed to determine the risk associated with these infections. Our analysis revealed that RhV or A multivariate logistic regression model was used to examine the correlates of rhinorrhea in the study patients. Variables were put in the model in order of strength of their correlation with rhinorrhea as per the bivariate analysis. The effect of each variable on the model was assessed, and the variable was kept if it significantly contributed to a better fit of the model. The final model included the following variables: RhV and CVEV. The results of the multivariate model showed that CVEV was independently associated with rhinorrhea (OR: 4.73; CI: 1.59 -14.07). CVEV infected patients were 4.73 times more likely to have rhinorrhea compared to none-CVEV patients controlling for RhV. Unlike the bivariate analysis, RhV was not significantly associated with rhinorrhea (OR: 1.78; CI: 0.91 -3.48). RhV infected patients were 1.78 times more likely to have rhinorrhea compared to none-RhV patients controlling for CVEV; however, this was not statistically significant.",

The effect of coinfections on disease outcomes is not well understood. 28 Patients coinfected with pandemic H1N1 influenza and rhinovirus tended to have milder clinical severity when compared with non-rhinovirus coinfections; 29 while the patients coinfected with HMPV and RSV were prone to a higher risk of severe bronchiolitis. 30 Additionally, the prevalence and severity of obstructive airway disease were higher in patients with coinfections. 31 In our study, coinfection was associated with higher risk of rhinorrhea but not with more severe symptoms like dyspnea. In contrast, some studies showed no correlation between coinfection status and clinical severity. 32, 33 The complexity of viral coinfections and the large number of respiratory viruses involved make challenging to study the effect of coinfection on disease outcome in a clinical setting. Therefore, there is a need for developing in vitro or in vivo models to allow a better understanding of coinfections. For example, dual infection with INF was shown to suppress RSV growth in vitro. 34 The suppression of RSV by INF was suggested to be due to competition for protein synthesis and budding from the cell surface. Further studies are warranted to investigate the interactions among respiratory viruses during coinfection and their effect on the host.",
