The neutral theory 2 maintains that most observed molecular variation -both polymorphism within species and divergence between species -is due to random fixation of selectively neutral mutations. Well established cases of molecular adaptation have been rare 3 . Several tests of neutrality have been developed and applied to real data, and although they are powerful enough to reject strict neutrality in many genes, they rarely provide unequivocal evidence for positive darwinian selection.",

The first class includes over a dozen intuitive methods developed since the early 1980s (Refs 5,9-15). These methods involve the following steps: counting synonymous (S) and nonsynonymous (N) sites in the two sequences, counting synonymous and nonsynonymous differences between the two sequences, and correcting for multiple substitutions at the same site. S and N are defined as the sequence length multiplied by the proportions of synonymous and nonsynonymous changes before selection on the protein 14,16 . Most of these methods make simplistic assumptions about the nucleotide substitution process and also involve ad hoc treatment of the data that cannot be justified 14,15 ; therefore, we refer to these methods of estimating d N and d S as approximate methods. The methods of Miyata and Yasunaga 5 , and Nei and Gojobori 9 , assume an equal rate for transitions (T \u2194 C and A \u2194 G) and transversions (T,C \u2194 A,G), as well as a uniform codon usage. Because transitions at the third 'wobble' position are more likely to be synonymous than transversions, ignoring the transition/ transversion rate ratio leads to underestimation of S and overestimation of N (Ref. 10). Efforts have been taken to incorporate the transition/transversion rate bias (Box 1) when counting sites and differences 10-14 .

Most changes at the third position (before selection at the amino acid level) are transversions between C and G. Thus, the number of synonymous sites is less than half that expected under equal base and codon frequencies. Although, in theory, the bias caused by unequal codon frequencies can be in the opposite direction 15 , we have not encountered a real gene showing that pattern.

Fitch and colleagues 33,34 used parsimony to reconstruct ancestral DNA sequences, and counted changes at each codon site along branches of the tree. They tested whether the proportion of nonsynonymous substitutions at each site is greater than the average over all sites in the sequence. Suzuki and Gojobori 35 took a more systematic approach. For each site in the sequence, they estimated the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites and differences along the tree using reconstructed ancestral sequences, and then tested whether the proportion of nonsynonymous substitutions differed from the neutral expectation ( \u03ed 1). Suzuki and Gojobori's criterion is more stringent than Fitch et al.'s, because the ratio averaged over sites is almost always \u03fd 1. These methods are expected to require many sequences in the data set so that there are enough changes at individual sites. Furthermore, the reliability of significance values produced by these methods might be affected by the use of ancestral reconstruction, which is most unreliable at the positively selected or variable sites 24 , and by codon composition bias, which is most extreme at a single site. In a likelihood model, it is impractical to use one parameter for each site. The standard approach is to use a statistical distribution to describe the variation of among sites; for example, we might assume several classes of sites in the protein with different ratios 36,37 . The test of positive selection then involves two major steps: first, to test whether sites exist where \u03fe 1, which is achieved by a likelihood-ratio test comparing a model that does not allow for such sites with a more general model that does; and second, to use the Bayes theorem to identify positively selected sites when they exist. Sites having high posterior probabilities (Box 1) for site classes with \u03fe 1 are potential targets of diversifying selection. The theory is explained in Box 3 (Refs 20,36,37) .",

Amphisbaenians, in particular, resemble scaly, loose-skinned earthworms, whose shovel-shaped or wedge-like heads function as soil-shunting devices. Specializations shared by snakes (Fig. 1a) , amphisbaenians (Fig. 1b) and dibamids include loss, reduction and consolidation of skull bones; braincase enclosure; dorsal displacement of jaw-closing muscles; loss or reduction of limbs and girdles; and increased uniformity along the vertebral column. Furthermore, differences between the eyes of lizards and snakes are consistent with a model in which structures that were barely useful in a burrower underwent progressive reduction. Thus, whereas lizards, like humans, distort eye lens curvature to focus on objects, snakes lack ciliary muscles and are compelled to move the entire lens back and forth relative to the retina.

            "text": "The identification of sites under positive selection from the sperm lysin genes of 25 abalone species. (a) Posterior probabilities for site classes with different ratios along the sequence. The lysin sequence of the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) is shown below the x-axis. ML estimates under Model M3 (discrete) 37 suggest three site classes with the ratios at 0 \u03ed 0.085 (grey), 1 \u03ed 0.911 (green) and 2 \u03ed 3.065 (red), and with proportions p 0 \u03ed 0.329, p 1 \u03ed 0.402 and p 2 \u03ed 0.269. These proportions are the prior probabilities (Box 1) that any site belongs to the three classes. The data (codon configurations in different species) at a site alter the prior probabilities dramatically, and thus the posterior probabilities might be different from the prior probabilities. For example, the posterior probabilities for Site 1 are 0.944, 0.056 and 0.000, and thus this site is likely to be under strong purifying selection. The posterior probabilities for Site 4 are 0.000, 0.000 and 1.000, and thus this site is almost certainly under diversifying selection. (b) Lysin crystal structure from the red abalone (Protein Data Bank file 1LIS), with sites coloured according to their most likely class inferred in (a). The structure starts from amino acid four (His) at the N-terminus, because the first three amino acids are unresolved. The five \u2423helices are indicated: \u24231 from amino acids 13 to 38, \u24232 from 44 to 74, \u24233 from 82 to 95, \u24234 from 99 to 107 and \u24235 from 116 to 123. Note that sites potentially under positive selection (red) are scattered all over the primary sequence but tend to cluster around the top and bottom of the crystal structure.
