Today the virus is widespread throughout the country and increasingly causes disease in calves and young cattle. During the first few years the mucosal form of the disease (\"mucosal disease\") was mos~ commonly diagnosed, but now the enteritic form (\"viral diarrhoea\") predominates. BVD-MD may generally be diagnosed by clinical and pathological investigation in addition to the isolation of the agent in secretions and excretions, the intestinal mucosa, lymph nodes, spleen and blood. The demonstration of virus neutralising antibodies in paired sera is of little importance because of time reasons. A survey of the methods for diagnosing BVD-MD is shown in",

Such provocation of disease can always occur when the first vaccination, (using vaccines made from inactivated agents), is done either during the incubation of infectious disease or when the animal is infected but shows no clinical signs. When animals are brought together at 2-3 months of age, vaccination With \"Cattle flu vaccine\" should be performed on their have a developing or formed immunity against the most important viral agents when they are crowded together. If necessary revaccination has to be done after they are crowded together. If vaccination with \"Cattle flu vaccine\" is not possible on the animal's farm of origin, it should be carried out as in younger calves; that is paramunization followed by vaccination with \"cattle flu vaccine\". Depending on the method of husbandry, the age of the animals and the disease problem in a population the following vaccination schedules are suggested: Closed herds All animals more than 6 weeks and up to 18 months old should be vaccinated twice with an interval of 4-6 weeks between vaccinations; the first vaccination should be at the end of August/beginning of September. Calves born later should also be vaccinated twice with the first vaccination at 5-6 weeks of age and revaccination at the end of August/beginning of September. In grazing animals the double vaccination should be completed before the animals are stabled in the autumn.",

However, inactivated vaccines are compietely safe and prevent the spread of vaccine virus into populations free from infection or with a low incidence of infection. Live virus vaccines are usually used only when the genital form of the disease occurs in valuable animals, for example at insemination stations, or when breeding damage may be expected. A vaccination campaign has to be supplemented by organizational and preventive measures (e.g. quarantine; hygiene; slaughter etc.), whether inactivated or live virus vaccines are used, and such measures have to be adjusted to the conditions on each farm, according to the epidemiological situation and husbandry methods",

Stomatitis papulosa infections spread enzootically. They are usually subclinical or they may occur as \"teat pox\" in dairy cows. In veal production farms stress and synergistic interactions with other mixed infections may activate these infections and cause clinical disease. In these cases they may be confused with mucosal disease and other mucosal infections. Stomatitis papulosa became apparent in the FRG mainly because of pustular lesions on the hands, arms and legs of persons working with the animals. These lesions have become more common during the last two years. Diagnosis may easily be made by means of the electron microscope and by isolation of the virus in secondary bovine fetal lung cell cultures. No specific control has been carried out in practice, but experimental studies have been performed on the virus in connection with the Orf virus infection of sheep. We have shown, by means of quantitative cross neutralization tests, that there is a close antigenic and immunologic relationship between Orf and Stomatitis papulosa viruses, although the agents can be differentiated on the basis of their nucleic acid structure, by analysis with restriction enzymes. The close immunologic relationship is important because calves can be vaccinated against Stomatitis papulosa with a live Orf virus vaccine. Recently, we have developed an Orf virus cell culture vaccine from an attenuated virus strain (140 alternate passages in secondary cultures from fetal ovine and bovine lungs), which ~s safe for lambs and calves and has good immunogenic properties.",
