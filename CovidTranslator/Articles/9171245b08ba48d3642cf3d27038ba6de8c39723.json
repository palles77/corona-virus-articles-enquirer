The biosensor technique based on imaging ellipsometry was employed directly to detect two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and serial serum samples from 10 SARS patients and 12 volunteers who had not SARS. Further, the kinetic process of interaction between the antibodies and SARS-CoV was studied using the real-time function of the biosensor. The biosensor is consistent with ELISA that the antibody h12 showed a higher affinity in encountering the virus than antibody b1. The affinity of antibody b1 and antibody h12 was 9.5 \u00d7 10 6 M \u22121 and 1.36 \u00d7 10 7 M \u22121 , respectively. As a label free method, the biosensor based on imaging ellipsometry proved to be a more competent mechanism for measuring serum samples from SARS patients and the affinity between these antibodies and the SARS coronavirus.",

            "text": "From November 2002 to July 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel coronavirus, quickly affected many countries and had a highly disruptive impact on people's lives as well as the economy. The most recent SARS outbreaks were reported in Beijing and Anhui Province, China, in April 2004. These indicated that SARS epidemics might recur at any time in the future (Peiris et al., 2003; Lingappa et al., 2004; Poutanen et al., 2003) . Currently, a number of SARS vaccine candidates were being developed, which included inactivated SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) vaccines, DNA vaccines, and attenuated virus vaccines that produced SARS-CoV specific protein (Bisht et al., 2004; . However, their utility in humans remained unclear. Moreover, there had been grave concerns regarding their safety as some antigens to the virus. Some vaccines might elicit antibodies that did not neutralize (Oba et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2003a) . Neutralizing the SARS-CoV infection through passive immunization of the antibodies carried a low level of risk compared with methods involving inactivated viruses or attenuated virus vectors (Wang et al., 2004a; Ter Meulen et al., 2004) . Thus, the screening of new and effective antibodies and a deeper understanding of the antibodies' responses to the viral components of the virus were imperative for more accurate diagnosis of the illness and the development of a vaccine.",

            "text": "After the new neutralizing antibodies were screened, there were various immune methods available to detect their presence and measure their activity levels. The key methods were: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blot (WB) (Wang et al., 2003a) , indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) (Wu et al., 2004) , reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR (Poon et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2003) . These methods exhibited varied strengths and weaknesses. Most of these methods required the samples to be labeled, which occasionally resulted in a high percent of false positives or false negatives, and required expensive equipment (Long et al., 2004) . Moreover, some procedures were a discontinuous method and kinetic information was not readily available by the possibility of mass transport limitations (Yu et al., 2004) . In contrast with these methods, the biosensor with imaging ellipsometry offered several advantages such as it did not require the use of labels; it was rapid, intuitionistic and low cost. Furthermore, it could analyze directly the interactive process. The biosensor technique was developed in 1995 (Jin et al., 1995a) . It was a protein analysis technique that was able to engage in swift, automated, multi-protein analysis simultaneously and which combined high spatial resolution imaging ellipsometry with microarray (Jin et al., 1996 (Jin et al., , 1995b . Previously, the technique had been used successfully in a number of scenarios, for example in, 1) human IgG molecules covalent immobilization (Wang and Jin, 2004b) ; 2) hormone detection (Zhao et al., 1998) ; 3) cell factor and its receptor interaction (Wang and Jin, 2002) ; 4) cancer marker test (Zhang et al., 2005) ; 5) quantitative protein competitive adsorption (Hofmann et al., 2002; Ying et al., 2002 Ying et al., , 2004 ; 6) kinetic detection for multi-protein interaction process (Jin et al., 2003) ; 7) biomolecule interaction (Wang and Jin, 2003b) .",

In this case, each area of the microarray may function as an immune-probe. An immune-probe can capture corresponding antigens (or antibodies) in the solution. When the corresponding antibodies (or antigens) in the solution interact with the immune-probe in the microarray, they form a complex upon their affinity and the layer covering the surface area of the interaction becomes thicker (or surface concentration higher). A significant increase in the attached layer thickness (or surface concentration) indicates that the solution contains the antibody (or antigen). The imaging ellipsometry is used to detect the protein layer pattern on the microarray surface. The distribution of the lateral thickness (or surface concentration) protein layer pattern is simultaneously detected, which may further point to the existence of antibodies in the tested solution for immune tests. During the binding process, the kinetic process of protein interactions also became observable with real-time spectroscopic ellipsometry. Some important kinetic data can be supplied using real-time experiments. Imaging ellipsometry is an enhancement of standard single-beam ellipsometry which combines the power of ellipsometry with microscopy (Jin et al., 1996) . Its technical details could be found in these literatures (Wang and Jin, 2003c; Arwin et al., 1993; Stenberg and Nygren, 1983 ).",

The solution not only removed contaminants of the silicon surface, but also improved the number of silanol groups on the surface, thus making the surface hydrophilic. After being rinsed in deionized water and ethanol, the washed surfaces were incubated in a mixture of 3-Aminopropyltriethoxy-silane (APTES 99%, v/v) and absolute ethanol (3-Aminopropyltriethoxy-silane: absolute ethanol = 1:10 v/v) for 2 h.

Following this, the wafers were rinsed with deionized water and the surface containing immobilized SARS-CoV was then blocked using 10 mg/ml BSA for 30 min.

Some antibody molecules diffused to the sensing surface reacted with the corresponding antigens on the surface, resulting in the formation of their complexes. The concentration distribution of antibody in the cell reached to uniform. The binding process between antigen on the surface and antibodies in the solution was then observed simultaneously. The distribution of lateral thickness (or surface concentration) of protein layer pattern was detected and recorded once every 1.3 s, which corresponded to the speed of the reaction between the antibody and SARS-CoV.

A significant increase in the attached layer thickness found by the biosensor provided a further indication of the interactive process.

Compared with other methods, the advantages of the biosensor based on imaging ellipsometry were evident as it didn't require labeling, and provided rapid, visual image detection. The non-use of labels avoided unnecessary disturbance to any bioactivity of analytes. Detection of neutralizing antibody in 10 serum samples from SARS-infected donors using the biosensor showed different concentration also. ELISA required labeling of the samples, which might affect the activity of the antibodies. The presence of the second antibody and the dye directly might affect OD. ELISA occasionally produced false positives (Wang et al., 2004a) . The biosensor and real-time analysis could detect directly the thickness of the antibodies' layer with no labeling. The biosensor demonstrated the fact that antibodies b1 and h12 had different level of activity in encountering the virus. In addition, the biosensor can performed multiple tests simultaneously, thus the biosensor with a microarray was much more convenient to analyze the two antibodies.",

Clearly defining interaction characteristics ensured that the best antibodies were selected as research tools or assay components. Two antibodies against the SARS-CoV proved to be an effective antidote to the virus and they might have practical application beyond simple clinical diagnosis.
