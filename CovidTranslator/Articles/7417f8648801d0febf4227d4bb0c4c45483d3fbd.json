Methods: Clinical follow-up, adherence to preventive measures and PCR-based pharyngeal bacterial carriage pre-and post-Hajj, were assessed in a cohort of 119 French Hajj pilgrims. Results: 55% had an indication for pneumococcal vaccination. Occurrence of respiratory symptoms was 76.5%, with cough (70.6%) and sore throat (44.5%) being the most frequent; fever was reported by 38.7% pilgrims and 42.0% took antibiotics. Respiratory symptoms, fever and antibiotic intake were significantly more frequent in pilgrims with indication for vaccination against pneumococcal infection. The prevalence of S. pneumoniae carriage (1.8% pre-, 9.8% post-Hajj), H. influenzae carriage (0.9%, 45.4%) and K. pneumoniae (2.8%, 9.8%) significantly increased post-Hajj. Pilgrims vaccinated with conjugate pneumococcal vaccine were seven time less likely to present S. pneumoniae carriage post-Hajj compared to those not vaccinated (3.2% vs. 18.0%, OR = 0.15; 95% CI [0.03-0.74], p = 0.02). Conclusions: Pilgrims at risk for pneumococcal disease are more likely to suffer from febrile respiratory symptoms at the Hajj despite being immunized against pneumococcal disease and despite lowered S. pneumoniae carriage and should be targeted for reinforced prevention against respiratory infections.",

            "text": "The Hajj is one of the largest annual religious mass gatherings in the world. Each year, Saudi Arabia attracts over 2 million pilgrims from more than 180 countries including about 2000 from Marseille, France [1] . The Hajj presents major challenges in public health and infection control and the crowding conditions favor the acquisition, dissemination and transmission of pathogenic microorganisms [2] . Respiratory diseases are particularly common during the pilgrimage, representing a significant cause of morbidity and a major cause of hospitalization with community-acquired pneumonia being a leading cause of serious illness among pilgrims [3] . The etiology of respiratory tract infection is multifactorial and complex. Whereas viruses are likely responsible for mild upper respiratory tract infections [4] , some studies have identified Streptococcus pneumoniae as one of the main etiologic agents associated with severe respiratory infections in Hajj pilgrims [5] . Predisposing factors for pneumococcal infections at the Hajj include older age, chronic diseases, overcrowding conditions and environmental pollution [6] . The natural route of pneumococcal infection is initiated by nasopharyngeal colonization and may progress towards an invasive disease, especially if natural immunological barriers are crossed [7] . The reported rates of S. pneumoniae nasopharyngeal carriage depend on age, geographical area, genetic heritage and socio-economic conditions [7] . This nasopharyngeal carriage is considered as the principal source of person-to-person transmission of S. pneumoniae [7] . In addition to S. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were frequently isolated from Hajj pilgrims suffering from pneumonia [8] [9] [10] . However, available data about the carriage of S. pneumoniae and other respiratory bacteria in the overall population of Hajj pilgrims is limited [3, 5] .",

Potential adult participants were asked to participate in the study on a voluntary basis. They were included and followed up before departing from France and immediately before leaving Saudi Arabia by a medical bilingual (Arabic and French) doctor who traveled with the group. Upon inclusion (August 23rd to 30 th , 2015), the participants were interviewed using a standardized pre-Hajj questionnaire that collected information on demographics, immunization status and medical history. Based on French recommendations [12, 13] , pilgrims with risk factors for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) such as age superior or equal to 60 years, diabetes mellitus, chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, chronic kidney disease and immunodeficiency, were vaccinated with the 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV-13) unless they received the vaccine in the past 5 years. A post-Hajj questionnaire that collected clinical data and information on compliance with face masks use as well as hand washing, use of disinfectant hand gel and disposable handkerchiefs, was completed during a face-to-face interview, 2 days before the pilgrims' return to France. Pharyngeal swabs were collected upon inclusion on August 30 th (pre-Hajj specimens) and 2 days prior to the return of the pilgrims on September 30 th , 2015 (post-Hajj specimens). Influenza-like illness (ILI) was defined as the presence of cough, sore throat and subjective fever [14] . The protocol was approved by the Aix-Marseille University institutional review board (July 23rd, 2013; reference no. 2013-A00961-44). The study was performed in accordance with the good clinical practices recommended by the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments. All participants provided written consent.",

On the other hand, our study showed a significantly increased carriage of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae following participation in Hajj, confirming previous results obtained from cohort studies conducted among French pilgrims [17, 18] and from a large cohort study enrolling pilgrims from 13 countries [15] . Such bacterial acquisition is worrying since these pathogens are frequently responsible for Hajj-associated pneumonia [8] [9] [10] or may be responsible for acute rhinosinusitis [11] . We demonstrate here that vaccination against IPD with a conjugate vaccine had a significant protective effect against pneumococcal carriage following participation in the Hajj. Additionally, none of the pilgrims in our cohort suffered from pneumonia. The impact of vaccination against IPD on the reduction of the acquisition of S. pneumoniae respiratory carriage and on the prevention of pneumococcal disease in adults is well-described in the literature, especially in at-risk patients, including those with bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic heart failure, splenectomy or immunodeficiency [19] . Consistent local or national official recommendations on the use of pneumococcal vaccine for Hajj pilgrims are lacking [6, [20] [21] [22] . The recent recommendations of the Saudi Thoracic Society for pneumococcal vaccination before the Hajj season are to vaccinate all persons aged 50 years and over with combined pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13 and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 23 [23] . 54.6% of the participants in our study had chronic diseases, making them at risk for IPD, or were aged 60 years and over, which is the age cut-off for recommended pneumococcal vaccination in Hajj pilgrims according to French medical authorities [12] . If the Saudi recommendation were to be applied, this proportion would have been 73.3%. In our study, 32.8% of the participants were diabetic. A similar proportion was found in a study conducted in patients hospitalized for severe pneumonia during the 2013 Hajj with a 34.8% prevalence of diabetes mellitus [9] . Respiratory symptoms and antibiotic consumption were more frequent in pilgrims with indication for vaccination against IPD in our survey. This apparently paradoxical result is likely due to the fact that pilgrims with indication for vaccination against IPD were older, more likely to present with chronic respiratory disease, diabetes or other chronic conditions making them at higher risk for respiratory infections due to S. pneumoniae for which they were protected by vaccination or due other respiratory pathogens for which they were not protected. This finding indicates that criteria used to identify pilgrims at risk for IPD could indeed qualify for pre-screening of pilgrims at higher risk for any respiratory infection and help targeting them for reinforced measures against pulmonary communicable diseases including vaccination against influenza, reinforced hand hygiene practice and use of face masks.",

Wearing masks especially when in crowded places, frequent hand washing with soap and water or disinfectant, especially after coughing and sneezing, and the use of disposable handkerchiefs are recommended by the Saudi Ministry of Health [24] . Only 8.4% of the Hajj pilgrims wore masks during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 and less than 1% wore masks during the MERS-CoV epidemic in 2013 [5] . In our survey, cough, fever and antibiotic consumption were significantly more frequent in individuals using face masks, which likely accounts for the high willingness of pilgrims suffering from febrile cough to wear a face mask, with the aim of avoiding spreading diseases. We have no explanation for the positive association between the use of hand gel and the prevalence of S. aureus carriage in post-Hajj throat samples. The negative association between the use of disposable handkerchief and H. influenzae carriage in post-Hajj throat samples may possibly reflect an increased removal of organisms by cleaning of the nasopharynx. The 6-fold increase in K. pneumoniae carriage in post-Hajj samples in individuals who consumed antibiotics during their stay in Saudi Arabia compared to those who did not may possibly be indicative of the high capacity of K. pneumoniae to acquire antibiotic resistance genes under antibiotic selective pressure [25] .",
