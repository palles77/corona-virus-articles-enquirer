Arenavirus infection of cells occurs via a pH dependent endocytic route, but detailed studies of entry pathways have not been done. We investigated the role of cell membrane cholesterol, caveolae, and clathrin coated pits in infection by Lassa virus (LASV), which utilizes alpha-dystroglycan (\u03b1-DG) as a receptor, and Pichind\u00e9 virus (PICV), which does not. Depletion of cellular cholesterol by treatment with methyl betacyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) or nystatin/progesterone inhibited PICV replication and transfer of packaged marker gene by LASV or PICV pseudotyped retroviral particles. In cells lacking caveolae due to silencing of the caveolin-1 gene, no inhibition of PICV infection or LASV pseudotype transduction was observed. However, PICV infection and LASV and PICV pseudotype transduction was inhibited when an Eps15 dominant negative mutant was used to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Altogether, the results indicate that diverse arenaviruses have a common requirement for cell membrane cholesterol and clathrin mediated endocytosis in establishing infection.",

            "text": "Arenaviruses are rodent-borne, enveloped RNA viruses, several of which cause hemorrhagic fever syndromes in humans mainly in areas of tropical Africa and Latin America. Of the arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers, Lassa fever is the most prevalent, affecting approximately a quarter of a million individuals in endemic regions of West Africa annually (Fisher-Hoch and McCormick, 2001; McCormick et al., 1987) . Because of its capacity for person-to-person spread, the lack of practical and readily available diagnostic tests, and limited therapeutic options, Lassa virus is included in the list of category A priority pathogens for biodefense research (Borio et al., 2002) . Like some other highly hazardous viruses, hemorrhagic fevercausing arenaviruses have not been well studied; hence many basic mechanisms of their life cycle in the infected cell have not been elucidated. In particular, significant gaps exist in the knowledge of mechanisms of cellular uptake/viral entry, events which could provide targets for antiviral therapeutic approaches. Cellular entry is initiated when viruses bind cellular receptors via their surface glycoproteins. Arenaviruses possess surface spikes composed of trimeric GP1 subunits non-covalently attached to a transmembrane stalk comprised of trimeric GP2 (Burns and Buchmeier, 1991; Eschli et al., 2006) . GP1 is responsible for receptor binding, whereas GP2 drives fusion of the virion membrane with cellular membranes (Glushakova et al., 1990; Glushakova et al., 1992) . The laminin-binding protein alpha-dystroglycan functions as a receptor for Lassa virus as well as the prototype virus, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) (Cao et al., 1998) . The pathogenic New World arenaviruses Junin, Guanarito, and Machupo have recently been shown to utilize the cellular transferrin 1 receptor (TfR 1) during viral entry (Radoshitzky et al., 2007) . Arenavirus infection is pH-dependent (Glushakova and Lukashevich, 1989) , and may require GP1 dissociation from GP2 at low pH, exposing fusogenic domains of GP2, triggering penetration (Di Simone et al., 1994; Di Simone and Buchmeier, 1995) . Unlike the majority of viruses that exhibit pH-dependent entry, the Old World arenavirus LCMV does not appear to utilize the clathrin-mediated endocytic route as judged by ultra-structural studies showing LCMV internalization into smooth-walled vesicles (Borrow and Oldstone, 1994) . However, recent evidence implicates clathrin-mediated endocytosis for Junin virus entry (Martinez et al., 2007) . Whether the other arenaviruses utilize the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway remains to be determined.",

            "text": "It has recently been shown that depletion of cellular cholesterol inhibits infection by the prototype arenavirus, LCMV (Shah et al., 2006) . Among the cholesterol-dependent entry pathways, those that utilize lipid rafts or caveolae are best studied (Marsh and Helenius, 2006; Pelkmans and Helenius, 2003) . Caveolae and lipid rafts are cholesterol and glycosphingolipid enriched plasma membrane microdomains that are insoluble in non-ionic detergents and have been implicated in modulating cell adhesion, membrane trafficking, pathogen entry, and signal transduction (Brown and London, 1998; Hakomori et al., 2000a; Hakomori et al., 2000b; Simons and Ikonen, 1997) . Caveolae are identifiable as stable invaginations of the plasma membrane which are enriched in caveolin, a cholesterol-binding membrane protein. Expression of caveolin 1 (cav-1) has been shown to be sufficient to produce caveolae in cells (Lipardi et al., 1998 ). An endocytic pathway leading from caveolae at neutral pH to the smooth ER or Golgi is utilized by some viruses such as SV40 (Pietiainen et al., 2005) and Coxsackie virus B4 (Triantafilou and Triantafilou, 2004) . However, there are also examples of pH-dependent viruses that require caveolae/lipid rafts for entry, such as filoviruses (Bavari et al., 2002; Schornberg et al., 2006; Takada et al., 1997) .",

The goal of this study was to clarify the roles of cholesterol, and caveolar or clathrin-mediated endocytic pathways in cellular infection of representative Old World and New World arenaviruses or their pseudotyped surrogates. Two arenaviruses were studied: (1) the guinea pig-passaged Pichind\u00e9 virus (PICV) variant P18, which causes hemorrhagic fever in guinea pigs (Jahrling et al., 1981; Zhang et al., 1999) , and does not utilize alpha-dystroglycan as a receptor (Rojek et al., 2006) , and (2) the Lassa-pseudotyped murine leukemia virus (LASV-MLV), which enters by an alpha-dystroglycan dependent mechanism. We show that cholesterol is required for cellular infection of PICV and the LASV-MLV pseudotype in several relevant cell types in a caveolin-1 independent mechanism and that the effect of cholesterol depletion on infection is at the level of entry. In addition, the data suggests that entry of PICV and the LASV-MLV pseudotype into host cells occurs through the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway.",

When Vero cells were pretreated with M\u03b2CD prior to exposure to PICV, a 90% reduction in plaque numbers was seen ( Figure 1A ). The residual plaques on M\u03b2CD-treated Vero cell were 29% smaller (p < 0.01) than those in untreated Vero cell cultures (data not shown). When M\u03b2CD-treated cells were reconstituted with cholesterol prior to the addition of virus, plaque numbers were restored to control levels. M\u03b2CD treatment of Vero cells did not have a significant effect on Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) plaque formation. Treatment of Vero cells with nystatin/progesterone (nys/prog), which disrupts cholesterol enriched domains by specifically binding to cholesterol and by interfering with cholesterol synthesis, also inhibited PICV infection. Incubating cells with nys/prog resulted in a reduction of plaque numbers similar to that of M\u03b2CD-treated Vero cells, without affecting VSV plaque formation ( Fig 1A) . VSV infection is known to occur via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Sun et al., 2005) and is not sensitive to membrane cholesterol depletion (Danthi and Chow, 2004) . This control also rules out significant drug-induced cytoxicity.",

We used both PICV and LASV-envelope protein pseudotyped particles for these analyses. Retroviral pseudotypes allowed work to be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory setting and isolated the envelope function from other viral components and functions. To characterize the PICV and LASV-MLV pseudotypes, both the DG control hemizygous murine ES DG(+/-) and the DG knockout murine ES DG(-/-) cell lines (Shah et al., 2006; Zhan et al., 2005) were transduced with the PICV and LASV env-MLV pseudotypes ( Fig 4A) . LASV (an Old World arenavirus) has been shown to infect cells in an \u03b1-DG dependent manner, whereas PICV (a New World Clade A arenavirus) infection occurs independently of \u03b1-DG (Rojek et al., 2006; Spiropoulou et al., 2002) . As expected, the LASV-MLV pseudotypes transduced the ES DG(+/-) cells significantly better than the ES DG(-/-), which is in agreement with other published reports (Rojek et al., 2006; Kunz et al., 2005; Kunz et al., 2001) . However, no significant difference was observed among ES DG(+/-) and ES DG (-/-) when transduced with the PICV-MLV pseudotype. This demonstrates that PICV-MLV pseudotypes, similar to the Clade B human pathogenic viruses, do not require \u03b1-DG for infection. No difference was observed in infection of the ES DG(+/-) or ES DG(-/-) cell lines by the control VSV-MLV pseudotype.",

            "text": "It has recently been shown that the Clade B arenaviruses Junin, Machupo, and Guanarito bind to the cellular TfR 1 (Radoshitzky et al., 2007) during viral entry. Uptake of the natural ligand of TfR1, transferrin, occurs via clathrin-coated pits. Therefore, we studied the contribution of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in arenavirus entry. EGFR pathway substrate clone 15 (Eps15) is a constituent of clathrin-coated pits and is required for clathrin-coated pit assembly and function (Benmerah et al., 1999) . We used a dominant negative mutant of Eps15 (E\u039495/295) which encodes a mutant Eps15 and a GFP fusion protein to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Benmerah et al., 1999) . Using the Amaxa Nucleofector II (as described in the materials and methods section), we measured 79.5% \u00b1 1.3% of Vero cells that expressed GFP after transfection with the E\u039495/295 (data not shown). We observed a significant reduction of PICV replication in Vero cells transfected with E\u039495/295 when compared to untreated infected-Vero cells or infected-Vero cells transfected with the empty vector control plasmid ( Fig 6A) . VSV was used as a positive control and showed the expected inhibition of infection in E\u039495/295-transfected cells. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated a reduction of PICV GPC and GP1 in Vero cells transfected with E\u039495/295 when compared to PICV-infected cells transfected with the empty vector control plasmid (Fig 6B) . Expression of marker gene after transduction of cells with the LASV-MLV or PICV-MLV pseudotypes was also reduced in E\u039495/295 transfected cells by approximately 71% and 69.8%, respectively ( Fig 6C) . Examination by fluorescent microscopy revealed that the vast majority (98.3%) of PICV-MLV pseudotype-transduced Vero cells (\u03b2-gal +) did not express GFP from the E\u039495/295 plasmid suggesting that in the presence of the Eps15 DN mutant, viral pseudotype uptake was inhibited.",

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated that cell membrane cholesterol was required for infection of Vero and P388D1 cells by the New World arenavirus PICV, given that viral protein synthesis and viral production were inhibited when cells were treated with M\u03b2CD or nys/prog. These effects were not due to cytoxicity because replication of a control virus, VSV, was unaffected by drug treatments. When cholesterol was restored in target cells, virus replication increased to levels seen in untreated cells. The cholesterol-depleting drug M\u03b2CD has been shown to have additional effects on cells that can influence events downstream of virus entry, such as inhibition of calcium channels (Liu et al., 2006) . Two lines of evidence in our study, suggest that cellular cholesterol is required for early events in the arenavirus life cycle: (1) when cellular cholesterol was depleted 30 minutes after exposure of virus to cells, there was no inhibition of infection and (2) cholesterol depletion inhibited transfer of marker gene by replication defective, PICV and LASV-MLV pseudotyped particles. Altogether, these results demonstrate that arenavirus envelope glycoprotein-mediated entry into host cells is dependent on the presence of cholesterol in cellular membranes. This effect was seen in both primate fibroblast and murine macrophage type cells. These results are in agreement with a previously published study that reported that cellular infection by the prototype arenavirus LCMV could be inhibited by M\u03b2CD treatment (Shah et al., 2006) . We have extended this observation to arenaviruses that are macrophage-tropic and cause primarily hemorrhagic fever syndromes in susceptible hosts. The effect was similar for LASV-MLV pseudotype, which utilizes \u03b1-DG as receptor, and PICV (virus and pseudotype), which does not (Rojek et al., 2006) . We have also shown for the first time that PICV and LASV pseudotypes were capable of infecting cells devoid of caveolin-1, indicating that arenaviruses enter cells by a non-caveolar pathway. This is consistent with previous ultra-structural studies of LCMV entry which suggested that viruscontaining smooth walled endocytic vesicles were 150-300 nm in diameter (Borrow and Oldstone, 1994) , which is typically bigger than caveolae (Razani, et al., 2002) . We cannot rule out the possibility that multiple entry pathways may be used simultaneously by arenaviruses, as has been previously shown for SV40 (Damm et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "Mechanisms by which cholesterol may be involved during viral entry include virus binding to cellular receptor(s) that are localized within lipid raft microdomains, which includes caveolae and non-caveolar cholesterol-enriched domains. For example, the HIV-1 CD4 primary receptor is constitutively associated with lipid rafts and can be detected within detergent insoluble fractions of lysed cells (Kozak et al., 2002; Millan et al., 1999) . The disruption of lipid rafts by cholesterol removal results in the dispersal of the cellular receptor(s) throughout the cellular membrane and reduces the opportunity for multiple receptor interactions that enhance virus uptake. Alternatively, viral receptors may transiently associate with lipid rafts/caveolae after being engaged by viral ligand and this may be important for viral endocytosis (Triantafilou and Triantafilou, 2004) . Although not well studied, there is currently no evidence that arenavirus receptors are localized to lipid rafts. GPI-linked proteins, which tend to be localized and concentrated in lipid rafts, do not serve as viral receptors for the New World arenaviruses (Rojek et al., 2006) . The TfR 1, which has been recently identified as the receptor for some New World arenaviruses, is not constitutively localized to lipid rafts (Harder et al., 1998) . \u03b1-DG (LCMV receptor) or its cellular partner \u03b2-DG are not present in detergent insoluble domains of susceptible cells, even after LCMV binds to cells (Shah et al., 2006) . This conclusion is weakened by the lack of studies using labeled LCMV to show translocation to lipid raft or non-lipid raft fractions. Additional limitations of the study include insufficient sensitivity of the assay to detect small but relevant amounts of \u03b1-DG, variations of proteinlipid raft association depending on the state of the cells (Kusumi and Suzuki, 2006) , and the detergent utilized to isolate detergent insoluble domains (Schuck et al., 2006) . However, our observations that arenavirus infection did not require caveolae supports the conclusions of Shah et al. in that caveolae are normally associated with lipid raft domains.",

We observed substantial inhibition of PICV infection in cells that were transfected with an Eps15 DN mutant (E\u039495/295). Infection with VSV, used as a control to ensure the effective inhibition of the clathrin-mediated uptake by this dominant negative mutant protein, was also diminished in transfected cells. We also observed that transduction of cells by the LASV-MLV or PICV-MLV pseudotypes was significantly reduced in cells which expressed the Eps15 DN mutant. This was demonstrated both by substantially reduced titers of \u03b2-gal expressing pseudotypes in E\u039495/295-transfected Vero cell monolayers, and by the observation that those few cells that did express the marker gene \u03b2-gal generally did not express the mutant Eps15-GFP fusion protein. Therefore, we believe that reduced infection/ transduction in E\u039495/295 transfected cells is largely occurring in cells that maintain functional Eps15. The finding of small number of double positive (\u03b2-gal/GFP) cells suggests that an alternate, non-clathrin pathway may support viral entry to a limited degree. Cellular uptake of labeled transferrin, a marker for clathrin mediated endocytosis and for the trafficking of a putative New World arenavirus receptor, was diminished after cholesterol depletion of cells. However, drug treatment in host cells did not affect total TfR levels as determined by immunoblot analysis. Classically, viruses that utilize the clathrin-mediated endosomal entry pathway are less sensitive to cholesterol depletion than viruses that utilize caveolae or lipid rafts during entry. However, studies have demonstrated that cholesterol depletion of cells affects the morphology of clathrin-coated pits and inhibits the detachment of coated pits from the plasma membrane during clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Subtil et al., 1999) . Overall, this suggests that PICV enters cells through clathrin-coated pits and that cholesterol depletion may inhibit entry by inhibiting clathrin-coated pit internalization. While this manuscript was in review, a new study demonstrated that the New World arenavirus Junin enters cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, in agreement with our findings (Martinez et al., 2007) . However, this study concluded that Junin entry is only moderately inhibited in the presence of nystatin and M\u03b2CD (20-40%). It is possible for Junin virus, a Clade B arenavirus, and PICV, a Clade A arenavirus, to have similar routes of entry but differ in their sensitivity to cholesterol depletion.",

Our data, taken in context with the existing literature, suggests the possibility that different Old World arenaviruses may enter cells through different entry pathways. It is also possible for these arenaviruses to utilize different endosomal mechanisms during entry into different cell types, some of which may lead to non-productive infection. \u03b2-DG, the cytoplasmic partner for the Lassa virus receptor \u03b1-DG, has been shown to interact with the GTPase dynamin at membrane ruffles (Zhan et al., 2005) . The results from that study suggest a role for dystroglycan in regulating the clathrinmediated endocytosis of transferrin. However, LCMV binding and infection of cells is not dependent on \u03b2-DG (Kunz et al., 2003) . These results suggest that although \u03b2-DG is not required for arenavirus entry, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is required. Intermediary events initiated by TfR1 and \u03b1-DG binding by different arenaviruses need to be studied. Altogether, our data demonstrate that PICV and the LASV-MLV pseudotype enter host cells through a cholesterol dependent, caveolin-independent, clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway. The alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV) entry into host cells is mediated by the clathrindependent endocytosis and has been shown to be sensitive to cholesterol depletion (Kolokoltsov et al., 2006) and it has been reported that cholesterol and sphingolipid is required for SFV fusion with host cells independently of lipid rafts (Ahn et al., 2002; Waarts et al., 2002) . We propose that the entry of PICV and the LASV-MLV pseudotype is similar to SFV in that entry of all are sensitive to cholesterol depletion and mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis. These findings may result in the design of therapeutics aimed at blocking the early stages of arenavirus entry.",
