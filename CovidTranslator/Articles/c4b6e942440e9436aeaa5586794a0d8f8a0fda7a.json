Morphological and biochemical alterations typical of apoptosis were analyzed in infected cells using a combination of techniques, including DAPI staining, the sub-G 0 /G 1 technique and the TUNEL assay. The onset of apoptosis was directly proportional to the virus multiplicity of infection. Transient expression experiments showed a direct link between astrovirus ORF1a encoded proteins and apoptosis induction. A computer analysis of the astrovirus genome revealed the presence of a death domain in the nonstructural protein p38 of unknown function, encoded in ORF1a. Apoptosis inhibition experiments suggested the involvement of caspase 8 in the apoptotic response, and led to a reduction in the infectivity of the virus progeny released to the supernatant. We conclude that apoptotic death of host cells seems necessary for efficient human astrovirus replication and particle maturation. D",

The nonstructural proteins of the virus are translated from the genomic viral RNA as two polyproteins; one of them contains only ORF1a (101 kDa) and the other includes ORF1a/1b (160 kDa) and is translated via a \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting event be-tween ORF1a and ORF1b . Both proteins are proteolytically processed giving rise to a variety of proteins, although it is not clear whether the viral protease is responsible for all the cleavages (Geigenm\u00fcller et al., 2002a (Geigenm\u00fcller et al., , 2002b Kiang and Matsui, 2002) .

It is characterized by a series of morphological changes and biochemical processes including cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, cleavage of DNA into oligonucleosomal length fragments and, finally, cell fragmentation into apoptotic bodies which are phagocytosed by neighboring cells without causing inflammatory reaction in the tissue (Saraste and Pulkki, 2000) . On the one hand, it appears that programmed cell death would serve as a host defense mechanism and obstruct virus replication. On the other hand, in later stages of infection and when enough virus progeny has been generated, apoptosis may also facilitate virus propagation to bystander cells avoiding inflammation. Thus, many viruses including both DNA and RNA viruses have developed strategies either to induce or to inhibit apoptosis at different stages of their replication cycle (Hardwick, 1998; Koyama et al., 2000; Roulston et al., 1999) .",

            "text": "The pathways for both induction and prevention of apoptosis are highly complex and still poorly understood. Caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, play a central role in the execution of the apoptotic process (Denecker et al., 2001; Stennicke and Salvesen, 2000) . Caspases are synthesized as inactive proenzymes and activated after cleavage at specific aspartate residues in a self-amplifying cascade. Activation of the upstream caspases such as caspases 2, 8, 9, 10 and 12, by pro-apoptotic signals leads to proteolytic activation of the downstream or effector caspases 3, 6 and 7. Two major pathways of caspase activation during apoptosis have been characterized. First, extrinsic activation is driven by activation of caspase 8 and is mainly initiated in response to ligation of cell surface death receptors, which include Fas and TNF receptors. Recruitment of initiator procaspase 8 to activated receptors with involvement of adaptor molecules such as TRADD or FADD, triggers procaspase autoproteolysis by proximity-induced activation. The second apoptotic initiator pathway, intrinsic activation, is initiated by caspase 9 activation after release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol. Cytochrome c, together with dATP/ATP binds to Apaf-1, and recruits caspase 9 after a conformational change of Apaf-1. It has recently been observed that some viral mechanisms of either induction or inhibition of apoptosis involve a direct interaction with caspases (Thome et al., 1997) . Moreover, some viral proteins have also been described as potential targets for activated caspases (Al-Molawi et al., 2003; Eleouet et al., 2000; Zhirnov et al., 1999) .",

The blocking effects of Z-IETD-FMK were dose-dependent (reduction of apoptosis of 7.3% at 10 AM, 23.8% at 100 AM and 39.1% at 150 AM), while Z-LEHD-FMK could inhibit apoptosis only at the highest concentration (reduction of apoptosis of 42.2%). It should be pointed out, however, that the specificity of this compounds when they are used at high concentrations is not always guaranteed (Thornberry et al., 1997) . Caspases belonging to Group III (6, 8 and 9) tolerate many different amino acids in P 4 position but prefer those with larger aliphatic side chains. Their optimal peptide recognition motif is (X)E(H/T)D, being all of them quite tolerant to substitutions in P 2 . The only exception is caspase 9, which has a stringent specificity for H in P 2 position. Thus, at 150 AM, the blocking effects of Z-LEHD-FMK may be due to a non-specific inhibition of caspase 8, whereas at low concentrations, only the optimal recognition motif may be able to inhibit caspase activation. Consistently, at 10 and 100 AM, only inhibition of caspase 8 had effective effects in reducing the percentage of apoptotic cells after infection, suggesting a relationship between astrovirus infection and caspase 8 activation.",

Viruses in the supernatant of infected cells were titrated using different approaches. Quantification of astrovirus progeny virions by both EIA and RT-PCR gave identical results in the absence or presence of any caspase inhibitors (Table 1) . Infectious titers, obtained by an integrated cell culture RT-PCR procedure (Abad et al., 2001) , were consistently higher than those measured by direct end-point RT-PCR titration. This is a consequence of the lower sensitivity of the end-point RT-PCR detection technique in comparison with the infectivity assay where an in vivo amplification in cell culture provides higher sensitivity. Surprisingly, inhibition of caspase 8 activity caused a 1-log-reduction in the infectious progeny. These results suggest a role of caspase 8-derived apoptosis in the astrovirus capsid maturation process that lead to infectious virion capsids.",

Using the Predict-Protein server, the analysis of the secondary structure of the whole astrovirus protein sequence revealed the presence of an optimal six a-helices structure of 95 amino acids close to the C terminus of ORF1a (from residue 620 to 714, accession number L23513). As a result of the proteolytical processing of ORF1a polyprotein suggested by Kiang and Matsui (2002) , this region would be included in the putative nonstructural protein of unknown function p38. The average percentage of amino acid identity and similarity between this region and several members of the death domain superfamily were 19.1% and 41.7%, respectively. In addition, using the 3D-SSPM web server in search of 3D structural homologies, this region showed structural homology to the death domain found in human Fas (hFasDD). An alignment of all the available astrovirus sequences from this region and hFasDD is shown in Fig.  7 . The presence of a death domain in a nonstructural protein of ORF1a suggests a direct link between this protein and the apoptotic pathway.",

            "text": "In the present report, activation of caspase 8 and caspase 9 was also explored to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of apoptosis induction. Caspases play a key role in the effector phase during apoptotic cell death and, while caspase 8 is an indicator of activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, caspase 9 is an indicator of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Notwithstanding, recent experiments have demonstrated that the hierarchy of caspase activation is not always maintained to promote the amplification of weaker apoptotic signals (Denecker et al., 2001; Kidd et al., 2000) . It is now clear that in some types of cells, during the execution of the apoptotic extrinsic pathway, the deathinducing signaling complex (DISC) is not efficient enough to activate downstream effector caspases and therefore it requires amplification of the apoptotic signal by mitochondrial-mediated events. Caspase 8-mediated cleavage of a protein called Bid, which is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, directs its translocation to the mitochondria, where it induces release of cytochrome c (Luo et al., 1998) . Like in the cases of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (Eleouet et al., 2000) , Sendai virus (Bitzer et al., 2002) , parvovirus B19 (Sol et al., 1999) or Langat flavivirus (Prikhod'ko et al., 2002) , our results, both by Western blot and specific inhibition experiments, suggest that caspase 8 pathway is involved in the apoptotic response during astrovirus infection.",

            "text": "The viral gene product that is responsible for inducing apoptosis in RNA viruses has been characterized in several cases such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Fernandez et al., 2002; Suarez et al., 1996) , murine coronavirus , infectious bursal disease virus (Fernandez-Arias et al., 1997) , HIV (Muthumani et al., 2002; Stewart et al., 2000) , poliovirus (Barco et al., 2000; Goldstaub et al., 2000) , influenza virus (Schultz-Cherry et al., 2001) , Langat flavivirus (Prikhod'ko et al., 2002) or enterovirus 71 (Kuo et al., 2002) . For other RNA virus such as Sindbis virus (Jan and Griffin, 1999) or reovirus (Connolly and Dermody, 2002) , induction of apoptosis does not require virus replication. After transient expression experiments, our observations suggest that an apoptosis inducer may be encoded in ORF1a of astrovirus. Little is known about the biological function of the nonstructural proteins of astrovirus ORF1a, except that they contain a 3C-like serine protease motif (Matsui and Greenberg, 2001) . In addition, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) has also been detected and astrovirus nonstructural proteins have been found in the nuclei of infected cells (Willcocks et al., 1999) . The biological significance of this nuclear involvement in astrovirus life cycle is not fully understood. ORF1a and ORF1b are encoded in two separate reading frames, but are believed to be translated as a polyprotein. None of the proteolytic cleavage sites that are present within ORF1a have been fully characterized by N-terminal sequencing of the processed products. Between the protease motif and the nuclear localization signal, two different cleavage sites have been proposed using different approaches (Geigenm\u00fcller et al., 2002a (Geigenm\u00fcller et al., , 2002b Kiang and Matsui, 2002) . By computer analysis, we have identified a potential death domain motif within the nonstructural protein p38 of astrovirus, based on the proteolytic model proposed by Kiang and Matsui (2002) . The prediction of coiled-coils regions close to the C terminus of ORF1a have also been recently reported in both human and animal astrovirus by Jonassen et al. (2003) . Death domains are one form of the prototypical protein-interacting domains that play important roles in many of the protein -protein interactions that take place both during the initial and the effector phases of apoptosis. A great degree of amino acid conservation is observed among the human astrovirus serotypes which have been sequenced at this region. The presence of a death domain would bring useful information on the role of this nonstructural protein. Further characterization of the p38 nonstructural protein in virus-infected cells and mutagenesis studies of its proapoptotic domain are under way.",

Only when using a high m.o.i. and long times p.i., around 70% of cells underwent apoptosis. Several reasons could explain why not all astrovirus-infected cells undergo apoptosis. One possibility could result from a technical problem, causing that the apoptotic stage of some infected cells would not be detectable by the TUNEL method. Another explanation could be that at a given time p.i., due to different stages of the virus replication cycle, the amount of apoptosis-inducing viral protein produced within some cells would be still too low to induce apoptosis. Even a viral apoptotic inhibitor could also be encoded in a different part of the genome. An intricate balance between both viral and cellular proapoptotic and antiapoptotic stimuli within the cell may decide whether it will die by apoptosis or not. In cell differentiating types such as CaCo-2 cells, this balance may be even more variable depending on the stage of differentiation.",

            "text": "Interestingly, in the presence of a caspase 8 specific inhibitor, there was a significant reduction in the infectivity of the virus progeny, while the titer of physical virions (estimated by EIA and RT-PCR) was not affected. These data are different from those obtained for other viruses such as Sendai virus (Bitzer et al., 1999) , transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (Eleouet et al., 1999) or avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (Liu et al., 2001) , whose virus production was not reduced when inhibiting the apoptotic process. From our results, we conclude that apoptotic death of host cells seems necessary for efficient astrovirus particle maturation. For some viruses, it has been observed that some of their proteins undergo caspase-mediated proteolysis within the host cell (Al-Molawi et al., 2003; Eleouet et al., 2000; Zhirnov et al., 1999) . The astrovirus capsid processing and assembly is still controversial. Recently, different models have been proposed by different authors using different human astrovirus serotypes (Bass and Qiu, 2000; Geigenm\u00fcller et al., 2002a Geigenm\u00fcller et al., , 2002b M\u00e9ndez et al., 2002) , and the action of a cellular protease has been suggested. Sequence analysis of all the available human amino acid sequences of ORF2 reveals the presence of some putative caspase cleavage sites close to the C terminus of the polyprotein. The relationship between a potential role of caspase-dependent capsid maturation and the physiological significance of apoptosis induction by human astrovirus in intestinal cells is currently being investigated.",

Briefly, 3day-old cell monolayers were washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and inoculated with viral stocks pretreated with 10 Ag/ml trypsin (GIX Sigma) for 30 min at 37 jC. After a 1-h adsorption at 37 jC, MEM supplemented with 2% FBS was added. As apoptotic cells usually round up and detach from the surface of the culture flask, a mixed population of both suspended and attached cells was always used. At different times p.i., floating cells were harvested and pooled with the attached cells, which were recovered by trypsin treatment. Supernatant fluids of uninfected CaCo-2 cell lysates were used for mock infections.",

After washing three times with PBS, cells were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 3% BSA (Sigma) and 0.1% Tween 20. For viral antigen detection, an immunofluorescence analysis using the anti-astrovirus monoclonal antibody 8E7 diluted 1:10,000 (kindly provided by J. Herrmann) was performed. At this point, samples were divided in two aliquots and incubated with different secondary anti-mouse antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech): cyanine5-conjugated antibody at a dilution of 1:100, and cyanine3-conjugated antibody at a dilution of 1:5000. All antibodies were diluted in 3% BSA -0.1% Tween 20 in PBS and incubations performed for 1 h at room temperature. After immunofluorescence labeling, cells were washed twice in PBS, prior performing the TUNEL assay as described above. Cyanine5labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Immunotech Coulter XL) and cyanine3-labeled cells were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMRB FLUO).",

First, the amount of astrovirus antigen in dilutions of the supernatant medium was measured by indirect enzyme immunoassay as described by Herrmann et al. (1990) . Second, the titer of astrovirus genomes was measured by end-point dilution RT-PCR, using primers A1 and A2, as previously described (Guix et al., 2002; Willcocks et al., 1994) . Finally, infectious titer was measured by a previously described method (Abad et al., 2001) . Briefly, samples were pretreated with trypsin and 10-fold dilutions were inoculated onto CaCo-2 cells monolayers grown in 24-well plates. Trypsin was added to the p.i. medium and the presence of virus in the supernatant of each dilution was evaluated by RT-PCR using primers A1 and A2, after 6 days of incubation.",
