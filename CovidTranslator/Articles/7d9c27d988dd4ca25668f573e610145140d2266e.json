To reduce the spread of infections, biocides with a proven virucidal efficacy should be readily available. The World Health Organization (WHO) proposed in its 2009 Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care the use of of 2 alcohol-based hand rubs (formulation I and formulation II) for surgical and hygiene hand disinfection in healthcare settings and to reduce the transmission of pathogens by hands [1] . However, limited data exist on the efficacy of disinfectants, including the WHO formulations, against novel viruses that have emerged during recent outbreaks in different parts of the world. Most recently, Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus that was discovered originally in Africa, has raised considerable international concern. In 2013, the largest and most complex outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV), a filovirus that spreads mainly through contact with body fluids of symptomatic patients or contaminated surfaces, occurred in West Africa [2] . One year previously in 2012, a novel Coronavirus (CoV) named Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged, preceded by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003, with both viruses causing acute respiratory diseases in humans and displaying a high case-fatality rate.",

Whereas HCV is a blood-borne virus [10] , transmission of ZIKV occurs mainly through mosquitos, with the most important and common vectors being the Aedes genus. However, other modes of transmission, including sexual transmission, have been reported. To determine the efficacy of WHO formulations I and II against HCV and ZIKV, we incubated the 2 viruses for 30 seconds with the formulations at final concentrations ranging from 10% to 80% ( Figure 1 ). In the case of HCV, viral titers started to decline at a concentration of 30% with WHO formulation II and 40% with WHO formulation I and were reduced to background levels at a concentration of 60% with WHO formulation I and at 40% with WHO formulation II, respectively ( Figure 1A ). As depicted in Figure 1B , a dose-dependent reduction of viral titers was also observed for ZIKV ( Figure 1B) . Importantly, viral titers of 10 6 TCID 50 /mL in the control decreased to undetectable levels with WHO formulation I at a concentration of 40%, whereas a concentration of only 30% was required for complete inactivation with WHO forumulation II.",

            "text": "Based on the obtained virucidal activities of the WHO formulations against the different enveloped viruses, we next analyzed the inactivation profiles in a comparative analysis ( Figure 2C and 2D) . The most susceptible viruses to the WHO formulation I were the bovine and emerging CoVs (BCoV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) and ZIKV ( Figure 2C ). With a shift to increasing WHO forumation I concentration, the more stable viruses included the full infectious EBOV (trVLPs excluded in this analysis) and HCV ( Figure 2C ). The highest alcohol-based concentrations of WHO formulation I (>40%) were required for H1N1 and MVA, which displayed nearly identical inactivation response curves ( Figure 2C ). The results for the isopropanol-based WHO formulation II are depicted in Figure 2D ; it demonstrated a similar pattern of susceptibility for the different enveloped viruses with an obvious shift toward lower concentrations ( Figure 2D ). The CoVs and ZIKV showed the highest susceptibility to WHO formulation II, whereas HCV, EBOV, H1N1 and MVA demonstrated a more resistant inactivation profile ( Figure 2D ). To also directly compare the performance of the 2 WHO formulations, we determined the concentrations at which the products reached the EC 50 (Supplementary Figure 2) . World Health Organization formulation II showed a significantly higher virucidal activity against the different viruses compared with WHO formulation I (P = .008). In summary, CoVs and ZIKV showed the highest susceptibility to WHO formulations. Ebola virus and HCV were observed to be less susceptible than the CoVs, whereas H1N1 and MVA were the most stable viruses. In addition, WHO formulation II demonstrated a higher virucidal effect compared with WHO formulation I. The WHO has recommended 2 formulations in Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care, a document proposing the use of cheap alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce the transmission of pathogens [1] . We aimed in this study to analyze the virucidal efficacies of these products, particularly against emerging or re-emerging viruses that caused severe epidemics in the recent past [2] . Importantly, both WHO formulations inactivated all tested viruses, including ZIKV, EBOV, and emerging CoVs, in a suspension test with 30-second exposure time, implicating the formulations I and II were tested for their efficacy in inactivating EBOV transcription-and replication-competent virus-like particles (trVLPs) (A) and EBOV (B). The biocide concentrations ranged from 0% to 80% with an exposure time of 30 seconds. For this inactivation assay, 1 part virus and 1 part organic load were mixed with 8 parts of biocide. For determination of the EBOV trVLP infectivity, luciferase activity was measured 72 hours later. For EBOV, residual infectivity was determined by a limiting dilution assay. Viral titers are displayed as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) values. The cytotoxicity was calculated in analogy to the determination of virus titer (TCID 50 /mL) and is depicted as a dashed line. The means of 2 independent experiments with standard deviations are shown. Normalized values of percentage inactivation of viral infectivity (y-axis) were plotted against WHO formulations I (C) or II (D) in dose-response curves (x-axis, log representation). Viruses are listed in each panel and are ranked from the most to the least stable. Normalization and nonlinear regression calculation of all data were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.07 for Windows. Abbreviation: nd, not detected. usability of these formulations in viral outbreak situations. In the case of ZIKV, specific viral inactivation data are lacking, and consequently disinfection guidelines are based on data obtained from other members of the flaviviruses. So far, 1 recent study by M\u00fcller et al reported that ZIKV was inactivated by classical inactivation methods including ultraviolet light [11] . Zika virus was readily reduced in viral titers by the WHO formulations, similar to the other member of the family of Flaviviridae, HCV. These findings are supported by earlier analyses of the environmental stability and inactivation profiles of HCV, which showed strong virucidal effects of the main WHO formulation ingredients ethanol and isopropanol [12] . For EBOV, limited data on the efficacy of virucidal products are available because these viruses require high biosafety level laboratories. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises \"suitable disinfectant solutions include 0.5% sodium hypochloride as well as 2% glutaraldehyde and phenolic disinfectants (0.5-3%)\" for EBOV inactivation [13] . The comparative inactivation analyses of all viruses tested revealed that the CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV, were the most susceptible viruses to WHO formulation treatment. The degree of susceptibility of the different viruses to the WHO formulation likely depends on the specific surface properties of the lipophilic envelope of the respective virus. We could show by a comparative inactivation analysis that H1N1 and MVA showed the highest stability against alcohol-based inactivation, with higher concentrations of WHO formulation I and II being required compared with CoVs, ZIKV, and EBOV. These results confirm MVA as the model surrogate virus for all enveloped viruses for testing chemical disinfectants and antiseptics in human medicine [8] . When testing nonenveloped viruses like noro-, polio-, or adenovirus, a far higher level of resistance to both WHO formulations was observed, probably due to the more hydrophilic character of these viruses [3, 6] . Interestingly, WHO formulation I was superior compared with WHO formulation II in inactivating these nonenveloped viruses, whereas in this study the opposite effect occurred, with WHO formulation II showing a higher virucidal activity against enveloped viruses. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of the virus envelope, which likely renders enveloped viruses more susceptible to the isopropanol-based WHO formulation II compared with the ethanol-based WHO formulation I [14] . Furthermore, isopropanol has 1 more carbon than ethanol, giving it greater lipophilic properties and higher virucidal activities against lipophilic viruses [15] .",

A, World Health Organization formulations I and II were tested for their efficacy in inactivating HCV. The biocide concentrations ranged from 0% to 80% with an exposure time of 30 seconds. For this inactivation assay, 1 part virus and 1 part organic load were mixed with 8 parts biocide. Residual infectivity was determined by a limiting dilution assay. Viral titers are displayed as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) values. The cytotoxicity was calculated in analogy to the determination of virus titer (TCID 50 /mL) and is depicted as a dashed line. The means of 2 independent experiments with standard deviations are shown. Efficacy of WHO formulations I and II against ZIKV (B), MERS-CoV (C), and SARS-CoV (D) was addressed by a quantitative suspension assay as described for panel A. Abbreviation: nd, not detected.",
