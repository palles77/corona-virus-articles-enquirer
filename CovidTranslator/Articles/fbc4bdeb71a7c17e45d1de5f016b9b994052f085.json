The high degree of specialization of cell types that comprise the CNS, and their intricate communication, controls both cognitive and vital functions. Disruption of the communication network and poor CNS regenerative properties make this organ vulnerable to microbial as well as physical injury. Although it is known that host responses must be strictly regulated to preserve CNS function and to minimize the incidence of autoimmunity, the factors regulating CNS immune and repair responses are not well understood. In addition to the absence of a dedicated lymphatic drainage system, CNS cells express few, if any, molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1-3 . Therefore, in the quiescent CNS there is little endogenous antigen presentation or potential to activate T cells. Although the underlying basis for this limited immunological activity is not completely understood, interactions between both neurons and the glial population represented by microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (BOX 1), as well as constitutive secretion of neurotrophins and transforming growth factor-\u03b2, might contribute to this quiescent resting state 1,4-7 . The limited expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the presence of tight junctions between these cells also limit or prevent large molecules, such as antibodies, and T cells from entering the CNS 2,8 . Despite this, a few activated/memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells randomly patrol the CNS in the absence of 'danger' signals, and either exit or die in situ in the absence of antigen recognition 2,8 .",

Several viruses that establish chronic infections in the rodent CNS provide useful models to examine both the roles and regulation of immune effectors in this vital organ. Collectively, these models have provided a wealth of information about the genetics of host resistance, acute and chronic viral infection as well as host defence mechanisms. Chronic, viral rodent CNS pathogens that are associated with myelin loss include two well characterized RNA virus models: Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), a member of the non-enveloped Picornaviridae, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the enveloped Coronaviridae. Although CD8 + T cells are important in controlling the acute phase of both infections, these viruses can escape immune surveillance and establish chronic CNS infection with ongoing myelin loss [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

Another distinguishing characteristic during chronic TMEV infection is that chronic inflammation involves activation of self-reactive T cells 20, 21 . By contrast, control of infectious MHV results in a slowly resolving, but chronic, CNS disease that is associated with minimal inflammation [16] [17] [18] . These chronic pathological changes in the absence of overt infectious virus are similar to human CNS diseases with suspected or potential viral aetiologies, such as multiple sclerosis. Therefore, MHV infection of the CNS provides a unique model in which viral replication is controlled by a vigorous immune response but the host is unable to achieve a sterile immunity, resulting in a persistent infection that is associated with ongoing pathology in the apparent absence of infectious virus.",

CNS infection is initially manifested by rapid, dynamic and coordinated expression of chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a tissue inhibitor of MMPs (TIMP-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (FIG. 3b,c; 0-5 days p.i.). Upregulation of these factors has largely been characterized by mRNA analysis of whole organs to reveal overall signal strength and patterns. However, more detailed analysis in a limited number of studies clearly indicates that both virusinfected and uninfected glial cells, most prominently astrocytes, provide early inflammatory signals 41, 47, 48 . Together, these molecules facilitate BBB disruption and attract innate immune effectors, which express inflammatory factors. MMP expression is associated with tissue influx of inflammatory cells, activation of cytokine secretion and CNS damage 49 The earliest chemokines induced in the CNS following MHV infection are CXCL10 and CCL3 (REFS 48, 52) . CXCL10 is expressed by both infected and uninfected glial cells as early as day 1 p.i. (FIGS 2, 3b) and recruits NK cells by signalling through CXCR3 (REF. 53 ). Despite rapid but transient NK-cell recruitment into the CNS, there is little direct evidence for an antiviral role; however, their potential to secrete IFN-\u03b3 might facilitate antigen presentation through upregulation of MHC class I and class II molecules. CCL3 might enhance the adaptive immune response by stimulating T-cell activation and recruitment 52 . Macrophages comprise the largest component of innate CNS infiltrates (FIG. 4a) . Their accumulation is enhanced by CCL5 (REFS 41, 54) , which is induced with slightly delayed kinetics relative to CXCL10 and CCL3 (REF. 48 ). Infection of the CNS with other neurotropic viruses, for example, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, TMEV and measles virus, induces chemokine-gene-expression profiles that are similar to MHV, which indicates that CNS-resident cells respond in a similar manner to viral infection, possibly through the expression of type I interferons (IFNs) [55] [56] [57] [58] .",

Basic tropism and pathogenesis generally reflect the original serotype: MHV-1, MHV-2, MHV-3 and MHV-A59 are generally hepatotropic; whereas the John Howard Mueller (JHMV) and MHV-4 strains are generally neurotropic. Plasticity of MHV pathogenesis has long been apparent, based on plaque-size variants 107 . The most detailed genetic and biological information is available for the relatively neurotropic JHMV and the dual hepato-and neurotropic A59 strains. Data have focused on the spike (S) protein, as JHMV variants with S-protein alterations or deletions show different tropism [24] [25] [26] and spread 34 . Recombinants that express distinct S proteins on heterologous viral backgrounds confirm that the JHMV S protein confers neurovirulence 26 , although JHMV background genes override A59 S protein in determining hepatotropism 108 . Deletion of a dominant CD8 + T-cell epitope from the S protein, characteristic of several less pathogenic strains and variants, further complicates pathogenesis.

The adaptive stage of acute infection is characterized by rapid spread of virus throughout the parenchyma and increased infiltration of virus-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells that secrete IFN-\u03b3, and subsequently increase expression of additional proinflammatory chemokines such as CXCL9, CXCL10 and CCL5 from astrocytes as well as inflammatory cells. Accumulation of virus-specific T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, ultimately results in a decrease in virus replication in glia. As virus replication is controlled, the number of inflammatory cells decreases, but viral persistence is associated with the retention of immune effectors in the CNS.

No detectable JHMV replication occurs at peripheral sites; however, virus-specific T cells are detected in the CLN prior to detection in the CNS or spleen 75 . Although adaptive immunity seems to be initiated in the CLN, whether infectious virus or only viral antigens are present in CLN and the identity and origin of MHV-specific antigen-presenting cells are unclear. Bone-marrow-derived circulating monocytes that are recruited into the CNS as an innate immune component might differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells and present antigen in the CNS 21, 76 . Alternatively, antigen-presenting cells might acquire viral antigens within the CNS and subsequently enter the CLN. The latter possibility is supported by detection of cells with a dendritic-cell-like phenotype in the CNS parenchyma and CLN as early as two days p.i. 77 . Therefore, it is plausible that, following phagocytosis of viral antigens and exit from the CNS, dendritic cells or macrophages in CLN provide an initial source of antigen presentation that is required for activation and expansion of virusspecific T cells.",

Indeed, IL-15, which regulates antigen-independent homeostasis of memory cells in lymphoid organs 93 , is not required for CD8 + T-cell retention in the CNS (C.C.B., unpublished data). Adoptive transfer of CD8 + T cells into persistently infected mice further indicates that there is limited recruitment to the CNS compared with the acute phase (C.C.B., unpublished data). These data are consistent with the recent observations that memory T cells traffic poorly into the CNS 92 and that activated T cells recruited in response to acute infection are only retained within the CNS on cognate antigen recognition 2, 7, 8 . Overall, analysis of persistent MHV infection indicates that CD8 + T-cell turnover within the CNS is limited and does not comprise significant ongoing peripheral recruitment.",

Antibody responses in infected naive animals are delayed relative to the vigorous cell-mediated immune response (FIG. 4c,d) . Serum antibody, including neutralizing antibody, is virtually undetectable and predominantly limited to IgM prior to the complete elimination of infectious virus (FIG. 4c,d) . Furthermore, mice that lack humoral immunity control CNS-infectious virus with kinetics similar to immunocompetent mice, accompanied by a normal inflammatory response during acute infection 97, 98 . These data are consistent with the concept that control of acute infection is independent of humoral immunity 17, 18 . However, in contrast to wild-type mice that recover, mice that are unable to secrete antibody show increased mortality after resolution of acute disease, associated with the re-emergence of infectious virus within the CNS 97, 98 . Interestingly, the A59 strain of MHV, which infects both the liver and CNS, fails to reactivate in the liver in the absence of humoral immunity 99 . Whether this is due to the absence of viral persistence in liver or reflects a fundamental difference in immune control in these two organs is not clear. Passive transfer of neutralizing, but not nonneutralizing, viral-specific antibody into B-cell-deficient mice following initial virus clearance prevents virus reactivation, confirming the crucial role of antibody in regulating CNS viral persistence 100 . The inability of transferred non-neutralizing antibody to prevent virus recrudescence is inconsistent with the apparent protective role for non-neutralizing antibody prior to infection. Interestingly, infectious virus reactivates as passive antibody levels decline, supporting a requirement for CNS retention of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) in providing long-term control of persistence.",

This model supports a paradigm in which cell-mediated immunity affects The direct antiviral role of CD4 + T cells is unclear; however, they enhance CD8 + T-cell survival and function by an unknown mechanism. Whereas perforin-mediated mechanisms, in the absence of IFN-\u03b3, control virus in astrocytes and microglia, IFN-\u03b3 is crucial for reducing infection in oligodendrocytes. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression on astrocytes is postulated, as perforin-mediated cytolysis requires class I expression; however, this has not been demonstrated in vivo. Increased IFN-\u03b3 release by T cells during interaction with virus-infected targets enhances class I expression on all glial cells and induces class II expression on microglia, therefore further enhancing target-T-cell interactions. b | As viral antigen is cleared, CD8 + T cells lose cytolytic function and virus persists predominantly in oligodendrocytes.

Although effective in controlling acute virus replication, T cells are ultimately unable to achieve sterile immunity or suppress virus reactivation, most likely owing to downregulation or inhibition of destructive effector functions in vivo. However, cessation of T-cell function is complemented by a wave of virus-specific ASCs that are recruited into the CNS following resolution of acute infection. In contrast to T cells, ASCs are maintained within the CNS at high frequencies during virus persistence. These data indicate that local secretion of neutralizing antibody within the CNS maintains virus at low levels, thereby providing a protective in situ effector system preventing virus recrudescence (FIG. 5) .",

Distinct MHV isolates, combined with powerful new genetic tools [26] [27] [28] , promise to shed light on these pathways. Differential cell susceptibility to antiviral mechanisms also requires further investigation 38, 39, 46 . Specifically, the ability of mature glial cells to present viral antigens 104 , regulation of ligands affecting lymphocyte function, and factors involved in apoptosis are of interest. Similarly, the responsiveness of resident CNS cells to IFNs in vivo is largely unknown 88 . The role of dendritic cells during virus-induced CNS inflammation, as well as CD4 + T-cell contributions to CD8 + T-cell function within the CNS 82 , also requires evaluation. Last, an intriguing question is how, and in what form, virus persists, although a replication-competent form is implicated by virus recrudescence in the absence of humoral immunity 97, 98 .

MMP-3, MMP-9 and MMP-12 mRNAs decrease either at the peak of JHMV-induced inflammation or rapidly thereafter47,50 , supporting an early role in shaping the CNS environment.
