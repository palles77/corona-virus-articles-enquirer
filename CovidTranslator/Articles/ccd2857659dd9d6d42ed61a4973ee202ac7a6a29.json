Of particular concern is the possibility of terrorist attacks involving chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons (CBRN) (Gilmore Commission 2002) . Organized terrorist groups (such as al-Qaeda) have tried to obtain or develop CBRN weapons and have publicly proclaimed that they consider obtaining them to be a religious duty (Lumpkin 2001 ), but they have not yet demonstrated the capability to effectively acquire, create, or use them. Nonetheless, CBRN weapons remain a substantial concern because of their potential to cause widespread death and destruction.",

Given these differences, we might also expect differences in the emotional and behavioral impact of bioterrorism compared with that of other types of terrorist events. For example, the unfamiliarity of biological weapons, the uncertainty in determining whether an attack has occurred and the scope of that attack, and the possibility of contagion and of being an unknowing victim of the attack may heighten the level of fear and anxiety associated with a bioterrorist attack (Alexander and Klein 2003; Demartino 2002; Holloway et al. 1997) .",

            "text": "But precisely how the public will respond to a bioterrorist event is unclear. Some people are concerned that the demand for health care services by the \"worried well\"-individuals without an organic etiology of their symptoms (Bartholomew and Wessely 2002) -will overwhelm health resources, even in the event of a very small bioterrorist attack. Based on prior terrorist events such as the sarin gas attacks in Tokyo in 1995, the U.S. Department of Defense estimates that an attack from a CBRN weapon would produce five psychological casualties for every one physical casualty (Warwick 2001) ; other estimates of the ratio of psychological casualties to physical casualties range from 4 to 1 to as high as 50 to 1 (Demartino 2002) . Some experts recommend planning for widespread public panic, whereas others believe that such expectations are misguided (Glass and Schoch-Spana 2002; Pastel 2001; Schoch-Spana 2000) . We do not understand under what circumstances people's emotional reactions will differ. These emotional reactions can range from common distress responses such as fear and anxiety to full-blown psychiatric disorders (Institute of Medicine 2003) . Nor can we now confidently predict how individuals' behavioral reactions to a bioterrorist attack (e.g., seeking health care services) may complicate planned public health responses. This article synthesizes the available evidence about the psychological consequences associated with a bioterrorist event to suggest steps that decision makers can take now to improve their response and to identify the research questions that must be addressed to better prepare the nation to cope with such events. We begin by examining a range of psychological consequences of previous bioterrorist-like events for various populations. We categorized these psychological consequences as emotional consequences and behavioral consequences. Emotional consequences include clinical psychiatric disorders like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in which individuals display the full constellation of symptoms and impairment required by clinicians to make a diagnosis. Emotional consequences also include less severe generalized distress and anxiety as well as symptoms of psychiatric disorders that may not meet clinical diagnostic criteria. Behavioral consequences cover such actions as seeking medical services; increasing one's use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs; avoiding an area; or evacuating a community. Next, we summarize our interviews with experts who have conducted research on communitywide trauma and disaster victims or have designed and implemented psychological response strategies for such events. We conclude by reflecting on the evidence and the experts' perspectives to suggest actions to be taken now and to recommend future research and policy priorities.",

Uncertainty about exposure to a biological agent and whether one was directly exposed is likely to increase fear and anxiety among the general public. Similar to what may happen in some chemical events, this uncertainty may occur even in situations with low levels of exposure and not only in the early phases of an attack but even for months or years after an attack (Hyams, Murphy, and Wessely 2002) . The risk of emotional and behavioral consequences for these individuals may mirror those of victims for whom exposure is documented. Similarly, the first responders to a bioterrorist event are likely to encompass more than the traditional emergency response community (fire, emergency medical service [EMS] personnel, police, search and rescue), to include hospital emergency department personnel, primary care physicians, and others working in the public health care system (Benedek, Holloway, and Becker 2002) . In fact, if a covert release of a biological agent does not immediately result in symptoms, the traditional first responders may not be called, and the first responders would be mainly health care workers (Gilmore Commission 1999 . In a covert bioterrorist attack during which the first indication of the event is the increased presentation of affected individuals at health care facilities, health care workers may initially have the highest morbidity rates, as was observed in health care workers in China and other countries in Asia following the outbreak of SARS (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2003) .",

The assessment of disorders such as PTSD offers useful information for predicting the early and longer-term clinical mental health needs of affected populations. This literature does not, however, offer much information about other emotional and behavioral responses and their effect on functioning.

As Table 2 explains, those directly exposed to mass violence and conventional terrorism experience a wide range of emotional and behavioral consequences, such as clinical PTSD, posttraumatic stress symptoms that do not meet the criteria for PTSD, other anxiety disorders, depression, and substance use problems. The documented prevalence of such problems varies widely for different events and may be attributed to differences in study methodologies (including screening methods and timing), as well as to differences in the populations studied and the traumatic events. Most studies screen victims to identify symptoms of posttraumatic stress and to determine whether the victims meet the criteria for PTSD. The severity of symptoms may not meet the criteria for some victims at the first screening, but if left untreated, these symptoms may become more severe in the following months and thus meet the criteria later.",

These studies found that at the time of an event, many individuals may be fearful, anxious, and present for screening related to the noxious agent. In at least one event (e.g., the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union in 1986), the emotional impact may persist for years, manifested as a higher rate of depression and mood disorders (Havenaar et al. 1997) . substantial emotional stress three to five days following the attacks. Individuals experiencing substantial emotional stress engaged in coping strategies (e.g., talking to others, turning to religion, checking on family members and friends) more often than did those without such reactions. Schuster et al. 2001 One to two months after the attacks, estimates of probable PTSD in areas close to the attack ranged from 3% (for the Washington, D.C., metro area) to 11% (for the NYC metro area). Estimate of probable PTSD in rest of country was 4%. Schlenger et al. 2002 One to two months following the attacks, 8% of Manhattan residents reported symptoms consistent with PTSD and 10% consistent with depression. Among Manhattan residents in closest geographic proximity (south of Canal Street near the WTC), the prevalence was as high as 20%. Galea et al. 2002 Seventeen percent of the U.S. population outside New York City had posttraumatic stress symptoms two months after the attack; 6% at six months. Prior depression or anxiety was associated with higher levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Silver et al. 2002 Five to eight weeks after the attacks, increased use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana was found among New York City residents living closest to the affected area and was associated with higher prevalence of current PTSD or current depression. Vlahov et al. 2002 Three to six months after the attacks, 18% of 1,009 individuals interviewed in Manhattan had symptoms severe enough to put them at risk for PTSD. Only 27% of these individuals were receiving counseling or psychiatric treatment. DeLisi et al. 2003 One to three months following the attacks, the three states in closest proximity to the WTC (N.Y., N.J., and Conn.) added a terrorism module to their ongoing Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System. In this survey of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults, they found that 3% reported being direct victims of the attack (7% had relatives and 14% had friends who were victims), and 75% reported having problems that they attributed to the attack.",

Anxiety worsened when isolation procedures changed, staff entered quarantine/ treatment, staff developed fevers, or staff were admitted with an unclear source of infection. Many staff were conflicted between their professional responsibility as health care providers and feeling fearful and guilty about potentially transmitting illness to their loved ones. Nurses on the SARS unit did not refuse work Maunder et al. 2003 assignments, but some professional and nonprofessional staff on general medical floors refused to care for patients with SARS.

The studies just summarized defined the populations of interest in slightly different ways and used different methods to assess emotional and behavioral reactions. Therefore, comparisons across studies must be made with care. Nevertheless, our literature review of the emotional and behavioral consequences of earlier terrorist events, communitywide disasters, and potentially analogous events offered several lessons that can help us prepare for future bioterrorist events. Clinical needs assessment conducted with sixth-to-twelfth-grade students seven weeks after the bombing found that posttraumatic stress symptoms were significantly higher in females, children who knew someone injured or killed, and children who reported watching more bombing-related television news coverage. Pfefferbaum et al. 1999 Seven weeks following the attack, a majority of children in the Oklahoma City area reported fear that a friend or someone in their family would be hurt and reported being nervous or afraid; 40% felt helpless. Fear, arousal, and dissociation at the time of the bombing was the strongest predictor of posttraumatic stress symptoms, more important than physical exposure, relationship to direct victims, bomb-related television viewing, and continued safety concerns. Pfefferbaum et al. 2002 Terrorist attacks on World Trade Center (WTC) and Pentagon, September 2001. Three to five days after the attack, almost one-third of children ages five to 18 in households in a national survey had emotional stress symptoms, and 42% discussed safety fears with their parents. Schuster et al. 2001 One to two months after the attacks, parents in 48% of households with children reported that at least one child in the household was upset by the attacks on Sept. 11. Twenty percent of these children had trouble sleeping; 30% were irritable, grouchy, or easily upset; and 27% were described as fearing separation from their parents. Schlenger et al. 2002 Twenty-two percent of parents living in lower Manhattan surveyed five to eight weeks after the attacks reported that their children had received some form of counseling related to their experiences after the WTC attack. More than half of the counseling was delivered in schools. Stuber et al. 2002 Within two months following the attacks, an increased demand for drug and alcohol treatment was found among individuals with preexisting psychological problems in 13 states and four major cities.",

Several interviewees noted that the plans and preparation for bioterrorism must go well beyond what is currently in place for other types of communitywide disasters. For example, uncertainty about exposure means that individuals across broad geographic areas are likely to perceive themselves as being at risk following a bioterrorist event, even if all confirmed cases are confined to a single state or geographic region. Accordingly, a response plan should extend beyond those areas in which there have been documented infections. Commenting on the experience of the anthrax attacks, one expert observed that a bioterrorist attack anywhere in the country would require public health officials in all 50 states to activate some components (e.g., heightened surveillance) of their response plan.

Such organizations can help educate the public, offering basic knowledge of biological agents and likely public health response plans and thereby enhancing the public's understanding and preparedness. These organizations are also well positioned to give information and support to individuals with particular concerns or needs, thus greatly increasing the effectiveness of the overall response. But several interviewees observed that \"we probably need organized efforts to train ministers, teachers, and others about their potential roles in psychological management\" after a bioterrorist attack. An additional benefit of a broad-based community response noted by several experts is that it would concentrate more on individual and community resiliency and less on emotional reactions and clinical psychiatric disorders.",

The interviewees also recognized the importance of determining how to treat effectively those persons who do develop psychiatric disorders, such as PTSD and major depression, as a result of bioterrorism. However, the experts also felt that relatively few would develop psychiatric disorders such as PTSD and major depression solely as a result of a bioterrorist attack and suggested that efforts to improve services to such individuals should not distract policymakers from the more global issues of managing changes in behavior (e.g., staying home, becoming hypervigilant, demanding more health care information, avoiding community involvement) that could be associated with bioterrorism. Several experts also noted that bioterrorism presents the additional challenge of devising plans to support health care workers, first responders, and others important to an effective public health response to a bioterrorist event, a response that is likely to be characterized by greater uncertainty about the level of risk for longer periods than in most other disasters.",

Many experts noted that this uncertainty requires the modification of many existing disaster response plans. These concerns also were supported by our literature review, which found high rates of emotional distress and behavioral changes stemming from those events that included uncertainty about exposure. Furthermore, in a bioterrorist event, the lag between exposure and the development of symptoms may exacerbate this uncertainty. Inaccurate knowledge about the organism involved may also hamper response plans and should be addressed by public health education programs. For example, for months after the anthrax attacks, many Americans were still not sure whether anthrax was contagious, despite media announcements that it was not (Blendon et al. 2002; Lisa Meredith, personal communication, February 13, 2003) . The public and the health care community should be given basic knowledge of the organisms likely to be used in a bioterrorist event and the planned public health response (Ferguson et al. 2003) . Such efforts would remove some of the uncertainty among the public and first responders and would begin to define some of the risk/benefit issues with regard to a response. One component of response plans about which we know very little is how the behavior of those responsible for coordinating and conducting an effective public health response would be affected by uncertainty about exposure. Not only could these persons be at risk as a result of their professional activities, but in a number of scenarios their families also might be at risk. The actions of the first responders and health care professionals cannot be taken for granted. One survey of physicians reported that more than half would not be willing to put themselves at risk of contracting a deadly illness in order to save the lives of others in the event of a bioterrorist attack (Alexander and Wynla 2003) , and fewer than half of emergency department physicians surveyed were willing to get the smallpox vaccine (Kwon et al. 2003) . Such attitudes and behaviors on the part of health care professionals are not unique to bioterrorism and were expressed during both the SARS outbreak of 2003 and the early years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.",

By its very nature, however, bioterrorism will always carry with it a high level of uncertainty, particularly during the early stages of an attack. Accordingly, response and mitigation plans must be designed with this inherent uncertainty in mind. Robust strategies are needed to address the needs of communities that are unsure of their level of risk and recognize that this uncertainty may also affect the behavior of first responders and health care professionals.",

The applicability of such events to bioterrorism, however, may be limited because of bioterrorism's intentional nature and the relative unfamiliarity of both the public and medical community with the likely agents. It is important to understand how risk communication strategies can best address sociocultural differences. As was apparent in the aftermath of both the anthrax attacks and the smallpox inoculation efforts, different groups in our society have very different life experiences and beliefs through which they view official communications regarding bioterrorism and related health behaviors. The collaborative and multigroup approach that the Institute of Medicine recommends is essential to a public health approach to these issues (Institute of Medicine 2003). Better understanding these issues must be a priority, especially considering the importance of risk communication to mediating, mitigating, or promulgating emotional and behavioral responses in the event of a bioterrorist attack, and given the reality that an effective public health response will likely require communitywide action.",
