The fact that the effect of endogenous and exogenous IFN in experimentally induced viral diseases is very often beneficial led to the idea that IFNs can be considered as natural non-specific antiviral agents (Toy, 1983 ) . These facts, with the recent advent of recombinant DNA technology, have prompted the use of IFNs as new anti-infectious agents with a broad antiviral spectrum and immunomodulatory properties in man (Oldham, 1985 ) and more recently in domestic animals, as demonstrated by several groups in the bovine species (Babiuk et al., 1985; Schwers et al., 1985; Werenne et al., 1985; Bielefeldt-Ohmann et al., 1987 ) .",

This subfamily was localized by in situ hybridization on the long arm of chromosome no. 1 (Yerle et al., 1986) . Class II subfamily contains at least seven loci among which six have been cloned and one pseudogene sequenced. As ~tPolFN-otII 1 is linked to a class I locus (Fig. 2 ) , class II loci are probably also located on chromosome no. 1. The nine upper clones (21 to 223) were isolated using a human IFN-a 1 probe (Mantel et al., 1980) and the six lower clones (2n23 to 2nl 1 ) were isolated using the porcine ~uPolFN-anl probe. Boxes indicate regions of maximal length containing an IFN-a loci as determined by Southern blot analysis. Class I and class II loci are represented by black and grey boxes respectively. Arrows indicate the position and direction of transcription of sequenced genes. Note that some clones contain two distinct loci. Clones 217 and 228 contain a class I locus and a class II locus (~uPolFN-aH 1 ) which is also present in clone ~'TI 10 (in the opposite orientation ). We chose to express PolFN-al gene in E. coli because it was previously shown to encode a protein with IFN-a antiviral activity (Lef6vre and La Bonnardi6re, 1986 ) . The gene introduced in E. coli plasmidic expression vectors was modified by delection of its signal peptide coding sequence in order to obtain intracellular synthesis of mature IFN-al (methionyl IFN-al, MetIFN-a 1: the 166 AA mature protein with an additional N-terminal methionine). Construction of the vectors, using standard recombinant DNA techniques, will be described elsewhere. We designed an expression vector (Fig. 3 ) allowing transcription, from the lambda bacteriophage PR thermoinducible promotor, of a bicistronic mRNA in which the cristron encoding MetIFN-a 1 was preceded by a short cistron encoding a very efficiently translated protein. To obtain a very efficient reinitiation of translation of the MetIFN-a 1 cistron, the two cistrons were placed in a translational coupling configuration allowing their consecutive translation by the same bacterial ribosome: stop and start codons were placed so that the reading frames of the two cistrons slightly overlapped in different phases (Oppenheim and Yanofsky, 1980; Gold, 1988 ). An efficient Shine and Dalgarno (SD) sequence had to be placed in the 3' end of the first cistron to allow translation initiation of the second cistron. SD sequence (see Gold, 1988 ) is a short sequence showing complementarity to the 3' end of the E. coli 16 S ribosomal RNA and essential for translation initiation of a cistron located a few nucleotides downstream. However, as it was impossible to identify a priori the best fitted SD sequence allowing efficient translation of a given cistron, we chose to insert in vitro in the 3' end of the upstream cistron a random synthetic sequence (7successive base pairs) instead of a given SD sequence. After E. coli transformation, clones expressing high amounts of MetIFN-a 1 were selected by a semiquantitative immunodetection technique allowing rapid screening of a large number of clones (Fig. 3) : ampicillin resistant clones were plated at high density, replicated on nitrocellulose filters and induced at 42 \u00b0C for PR dependent expression. Immunodetection of the recombinant protein was performed on in situ lysed colonies using an anti-porcine IFN-a 1 monoclonal antibody and bound antibody was revealed with 35S labeled protein A. The intensity of the autoradiographic spots was used to identify clones producing high amounts of recombinant protein.",

In summary the rlFN-a 1 did not lead to any weight loss in 5-day-old piglets, including those which received five doses of 106 units. In two experiments, no significant hyperthermia was noted. The main pharmacokinetic parameters, measured in the blood after i.m. injection, were as follows: time of maximum concentration (Tmax) < 1 h, maximum serum concentration (Cma x ) = 1700 IU/ml, apparent elimination half-life (T1/e ) = 210 ___ 40 min., measured between 9 and 24 h (Fig. 5B) . The same results hold true for one day-old piglets. Therefore we concluded that rlFN-a 1 exert no detectable toxic effect in the newborn. This is important if treatment or prevention of neonatal viral infections is contemplated using this recombinant molecule. Four adult Large White pigs weighing on average 80 kg, were injected i.m. with the same preparation of purified rIFN-c~l. Two received 10 6 IU/kg of eight, two received 5 X 105 IU/kg. The kinetics of antiviral activity was followed in the blood after aortic puncture ( Figure 5A ). There were two differences from the results with newborn animals: first, whereas the parameters Cma~ and Tmax were roughly identical for the young and the adults, elimination half-life was higher in the adults: apparent T~/2 = 280, and 470 +_ 90 min respectively for the doses of 106 and 2 \u00d7 105 IU, in the time-interval of 8 h to 24 h after injection. Second, there was a significant hyperthermia observed in the two individuals given the highest dose, followed at 32 h by a significant hypothermia. This transient fever, also recognized in human patients administered high IFN dosage, was not observed with the lower dose. The pigs, when observed for several weeks afterwards, did not show any problems.
