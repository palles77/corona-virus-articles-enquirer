Here we provide virological, epidemiological, evolutionary and experimental evidence that a novel HKU2-related bat coronavirus, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), is the aetiological agent that was responsible for a large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs in China that has caused the death of 24,693 piglets across four farms. Notably, the outbreak began in Guangdong province in the vicinity of the origin of the SARS pandemic. Furthermore, we identified SADS-related CoVs with 96-98% sequence identity in 9.8% (58 out of 591) of anal swabs collected from bats in Guangdong province during 2013-2016, predominantly in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) that are known reservoirs of SARS-related CoVs. We found that there were striking similarities between the SADS and SARS outbreaks in geographical, temporal, ecological and aetiological settings. This study highlights the importance of identifying coronavirus diversity and distribution in bats to mitigate future outbreaks that could threaten livestock, public health and economic growth.",

First, it demonstrates that coronaviruses are capable of causing fatal diseases in humans. Second, the identification of bats as the reservoir for SARS-related coronaviruses, and the fact that SARS-CoV 3-10 probably originated in bats, firmly establishes that bats are an important source of highly lethal zoonotic viruses, such as Hendra, Nipah, Ebola and Marburg viruses 16 .",

Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV, a coronavirus) had caused prior outbreaks at this farm, and was detected in the intestines of deceased piglets at the start of the outbreak. However, PEDV could no longer be detected in deceased piglets after 12 January 2017, despite accelerating mortality (Fig. 1a) , and extensive testing for other common swine viruses yielded no results (Extended Data Table 1 ). These findings suggested that this was an outbreak of a novel disease. Clinical signs are similar to those caused by other known swine enteric coronaviruses 17, 18 and include severe and acute diarrhoea and acute vomiting, leading to death due to rapid weight loss in newborn piglets that are less than five days of age. Infected piglets died 2-6 days after disease onset, whereas infected sows suffered only mild diarrhoea and most sows recovered within two days. The disease caused no signs of febrile illness in piglets or sows. The mortality rate was as high as 90% in piglets that were five days or younger, whereas in piglets that were older than eight days, the mortality dropped to 5%. Subsequently, SADS-related outbreaks were found in three additional pig farms within 20-150 km of the index farm (Extended Data Fig. 1a ) and, by 2 May 2017, the disease had caused the death of 24,693 piglets at these four farms (Fig. 1a) . In farm A alone, 64% (4,659 out of 7,268) of all piglets that were born in February died. The outbreak has abated, and measures that were taken to control SADS included separation of sick sows and piglets from the rest of the herd. A qPCR test described below was used as the main diagnostic tool to confirm SADS-CoV infection.",

The virus replicated to higher titres in piglets than in sows (Fig. 1b) . SADS-CoV displayed tissue tropism of the small intestine (Fig. 1c) , as observed for other swine enteric coronaviruses 20 . Retrospective PCR analysis revealed that SADS-CoV was present on farm A during the PEDV epidemic, where the first strongly positive SADS-CoV sample was detected on 6 December 2016. From mid-January onwards, SADS-CoV was the dominant viral agent detected in diseased animals (Extended Data Fig. 1b) . It is possible that the presence of PEDV early in the SADS-CoV outbreak may have somehow facilitated or enhanced spillover and amplification of SADS. However the fact that the vast majority of piglet mortality occurred after PEDV infection had become undetectable suggests that SADS-CoV itself causes a lethal infection in pigs that was responsible for these large-scale outbreaks, and that PEDV does not directly contribute to its severity in individual pigs. This was supported by the absence of PEDV and other known swine diarrhoea viruses during the peak and later phases of the SADS outbreaks in the four farms (Extended Data  Table 1) .",

To test this hypothesis, we developed a SADS-CoV-specific qPCR assay based on its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene (Supplementary Table 2 ) and screened 591 bat anal swabs collected between 2013 and 2016 from seven different locations in Guangdong province (Extended Data Fig. 1a) . A total of 58 samples (9.8%) tested positive (Extended Data Table 2 ), all were from Rhinolophus spp. bats that are also the natural reservoir hosts of SARS-related coronaviruses [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Four complete genome sequences with the highest RdRp PCR-fragment sequence identity to that of SADS-CoV were determined by NGS. They are very similar in size (27.2 kb) compared to SADS-CoV (Fig. 2a) and we tentatively call them SADS-related coronaviruses (SADSr-CoV). Overall sequence identity between SADSr-CoV and SADS-CoV ranges from 96 to 98%. Most importantly, the S protein of SADS-CoV shared more than 98% sequence identity with sequences of two of the SADSr-CoVs (samples 162149 and 141388), compared to 86% with HKU2-CoV. The major sequence differences among the four SADSr-CoV genomes were found in the predicted coding regions of the S and NS7a and NS7b genes (Fig. 2a) . In addition, the coding region Letter reSeArCH of the S protein N-terminal (S1) domain was determined from 19 bat SADSr-CoVs to enable more detailed phylogenetic analysis. The phylogeny of S1 and the full-length genome revealed a high genetic diversity of alphacoronaviruses among bats and strong coevolutionary relationships with their hosts (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2 ), and showed that SADS-CoVs were more closely related to SADSr-CoVs from Rhinolophus affinis than from Rhinolophus sinicus, in which HKU2-CoV was found. Both phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses demonstrated that the viruses from the four farms probably originated from their reservoir hosts independently (Extended Data Fig. 3 ), and that a few viruses might have undergone further genetic recombination (Extended Data Fig. 4 ). However, molecular clock analysis of the 33 SADS-CoV genome sequences failed to establish a positive association between sequence divergence and sampling date. Therefore, we speculate that either the virus was introduced into pigs from bats multiple times, or that the virus was introduced into pigs once, but subsequent genetic recombination disturbed the molecular clock.",

The SADS-CoV S1 gene was codon-optimized for eukaryotic expression, synthesized (GenScript) and cloned in frame with the Renilla luciferase gene (Rluc) and a Flag tag in the pREN2 vector 21 . pREN2-S1 plasmids were transfected into Cos-1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). At 48 h post-transfection, cells were collected, lysed and a luciferase assay was performed to determine Rluc expression for both the empty vector (pREN2) and the pREN2-S1 construct. For testing of unknown pig or human serum samples, 1 \u03bcl of serum was incubated with 10 million units of Rluc alone (vector) or Rluc-S1, respectively, together with 3.5 \u03bcl of a 30% protein A/G UltraLink resin suspension (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific). After extensive washing to remove unbounded luciferase-tagged antigens, the captured luciferase amount was determined using the commercial luciferase substrate kit (Promega). The ratio of Rluc-S1:Rluc (vector) was used to determine the specific S1 reactivity of pig and human sera. Commercial Flag antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as the positive control, and various pig sera (from uninfected animals in China or Singapore; or pigs infected with PEDV, TGEV or Nipah virus) were used as a negative control. Protein expression and antibody production. The N gene from SADSr-CoV 3755 (GenBank accession number MF094702), which shares a 98% amino acid sequence identity to the SADS-CoV N protein, was inserted into pET-28a+ (Novagen) for prokaryotic expression. Transformed Escherichia coli were grown at 37 \u00b0C for 12-18 h in medium containing 1 mM IPTG. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 30 ml of 5 mM imidazole and lysed by sonication. The lysate, from which N protein expression was confirmed with an anti-His-tag antibody, was applied to Ni 2+ resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The purified N protein, at a concentration of 400 \u03bcg ml \u22121 , was used to immunize rabbits for antibody production following published methods 27 . After immunization and two boosts, rabbits were euthanized and sera were collected. Rabbit anti-N protein serum was used 1:10,000 for subsequent western blots. Amplification, cloning and expression of human and swine genes. Construction of expression clones for human ACE2 in pcDNA3.1 has been described previously 5, 28 . Human DPP4 was amplified from human cell lines. Human APN (also known as ANPEP) was commercially synthesized. Swine APN (also known as ANPEP), DPP4 and ACE2 were amplified from piglet intestine. Full-length gene fragments were amplified using specific primers (provided upon request). Human ACE2 was cloned into pCDNA3.1 fused with a His tag. Human APN and DPP4, swine APN, DPP4 and ACE2 were cloned into pCAGGS fused with an S tag. Purified plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells. After 24 h, expression human or swine genes in HeLa cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence assay using mouse anti-His tag or mouse anti-S tag monoclonal antibodies (produced in house) followed by Cy3-labelled goat anti-mouse/rabbit IgG (Proteintech Group). Pseudovirus preparation. The codon-humanized S genes of SADS-CoV or MERS-CoV cloned into pcDNA3.1 were used for pseudovirus construction as described previously 5, 28 . In brief, 15 \u03bcg of each pHIV-Luc plasmid (pNL4.3.Luc.R-E-Luc) and the S-protein-expressing plasmid (or empty vector control) were co-transfected into 4 \u00d7 10 6 HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 4 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection and clarified by centrifugation at 3,000g, then passed through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter (Millipore). The filtered supernatants were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C in aliquots until use. To evaluate the incorporation of S proteins into the core of HIV virions, pseudoviruses in supernatant (20 ml) were concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion (5 ml) at 80,000g for 90 min using a SW41 rotor (Beckman). Pelleted pseudoviruses were dissolved in 50 \u03bcl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and examined by electron microscopy. Pseudovirus infection. HeLa cells transiently expressing APN, ACE2 or DPP4 were prepared using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Pseudoviruses prepared above were added to HeLa cells overexpressing APN, ACE2 or DPP4 24 h after transfection. The unabsorbed viruses were removed and replaced with fresh medium at 3 h after infection. The infection was monitored by measuring the luciferase activity conferred by the reporter gene carried by the pseudovirus, using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) as follows: cells were lysed 48 h after infection, and 20 \u03bcl of the lysates was taken for determining luciferase activity after the addition of 50 \u03bcl of luciferase substrate.",

Tissue from the small intestine of deceased pigs was homogenized and filtered through 0.45-\u03bcm filters before nucleic acid extraction and ribosomal RNA was depleted using the NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit (New England Biolabs). Metagenomics analysis of both RNA and DNA viruses was performed. For RNA virus screening, the sequencing library was constructed using Ion Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For DNA virus screening, NEBNext Fast DNA Fragmentation Letter reSeArCH & Library Prep Set for Ion Torrent (New England Biolabs) was used for library preparation. Both libraries were sequenced on an Ion S5 sequencer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An analysis pipeline was applied to the sequencing data, which included the following analysis steps: (1) raw data quality filtering; (2) host genomic sequence filtering; (3) BLASTn search against the virus nucleotide database using BLAST; (4) BLASTx search against the virus protein database using DIAMOND v.0.9.0; (5) contig assembling and BLASTx search against the virus protein database. For whole viral genome sequencing, amplicon primers (provided upon request) were designed using the Thermo Fisher Scientific online tool with the HKU2-CoV and the SADS-CoV farm A genomes as references, and the sequencing libraries were constructed using NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina and sequenced on an MiSeq sequencer. PCR and Sanger sequencing was performed to fill gaps in the genome. Genome sequences were assembled using CLC Genomic Workbench v.9.0. 5\u2032-RACE was performed to determine the 5\u2032-end of the genomes using SMARTer RACE 5\u2032/3\u2032 Kit (Takara). Genomes were annotated using Clone Manager Professional Suite 8 (Sci-Ed Software). Phylogenetic analysis. SADS-CoV genome sequences and other representative coronavirus sequences (obtained from GenBank) were aligned using MAFFT v.7.221. Phylogenetic analyses with full-length genome, S gene and RdRp were performed using MrBayes v.3.2. Markov chain Monte Carlo was run for 20-50 million steps using the GTR+G+I model (general time reversible model of nucleotide substitution with a proportion of invariant sites and \u03b3-distributed rates among sites). The first 10% was removed as burn-in. The association between phylogenies and phenotypes (for example, host species and farms) was assessed by BaTS beta-build2, with the trees obtained in the previous step used as input. For SADS-CoVs, a median-joining network analysis was performed using PopART v.1.7, with \u03b5 = 0. Phylogenetic analysis of the 33 full-length SADS-CoV genome sequences was performed using RAxML v.8.2.11, with GTRGAMMA as the nucleotide substitution model and 1,000 bootstrap replicates.

In the first experiment, which was conducted before the virus was isolated, we used three-day old specific pathogen-free (SPF) piglets of the same breeding line, cared for at a SPF facility, fed with colostrum (except one). These piglets were bred and reared to be free of PEDV, CSFV, SIV, PCV2 and PPV infections, and were routinely tested for viral infections using PCR. We also conducted NGS to further confirm that these were animals were free of infection of the above viruses before the animal experiment, and to demonstrate that the animals were free of SADS-CoV infection. The intestinal tissue samples from healthy and diseased animals (intestinal samples excised from euthanized piglets, then ground to make slurry for the inoculum and NGS was performed to confirm no other pig pathogens were found in the samples), were used to feed two groups of 5 (control) and 7 (infection) animals, respectively. For the second experiment, isolated SADS-CoV was used to infect healthy piglets from a farm in Guangdong, which had been free of diarrheal disease for a number of weeks. These piglets were from the same breed as those on SADS-affected farms, to eliminate potential host factor differences and to more accurately reproduce the conditions that occurred during the outbreak in the region. Both groups of piglets were cared for at a known pig disease-free facility. Again, qPCR and NGS were used to make sure that there was no other known swine diarrhoea virus present in the virus inoculum or any of the experimental animals. Two groups (6 for each group) of three-day old piglets were inoculated with SADS-CoV culture supernatant or normal cell culture medium as control. NGS and qPCR were used to confirm that there were no other known swine pathogens in the inoculum.",

Slides were blocked by incubating with 10% goat serum (Beyotime) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min, followed by overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C with the rabbit anti-3755 N protein serum (1:1,000) and mouse anti-cytokeratin 8+18+19 monoclonal antibody (Abcam), diluted 1:100 in PBST buffer containing 5% goat serum. After washing, slides were then incubated for 50 min at room temperature with Cy3-conjugated goat-antirabbit IgG (Proteintech) and FITC-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (Proteintech), diluted 1:100 in PBST buffer containing 5% goat serum. Slides were stained with DAPI (Beyotime) and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon). Reporting Summary.

The level of sequence identity of SADSr-CoV to SADS-CoV is illustrated by different patterns of boxes: Solid colour, highly similar; Dotted fill, moderately similar; Dashed fill, least similar. b, Phylogenetic analysis of 57 S1 sequences (33 from SADS-CoV and 24 from SADSr-CoV). Different colours represent different host species as shown on the left. Scale bar, nucleotide substitutions per site. Immunohistopathology of SADS-CoV infected tissues. a-d, Sections of jejunum tissue from control (a, c) and infected (b, d) farm piglets four days after inoculation were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (a, b) or rabbit anti-SADSr-CoV N serum (red), DAPI (blue) and mouse antibodies against epithelial cell markers cytokeratin 8, 18 and 19 (green) in (c, d). SADS-CoV N protein is evident in epithelial cells and deeper in the tissue of infected piglets, which exhibit villus shortening. Scale bars, 200 \u03bcm (a, b) and 50 \u03bcm (c, d). The experiment was conducted three times independently with similar results.",
