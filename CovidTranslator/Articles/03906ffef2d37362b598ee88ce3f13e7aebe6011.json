It has been noted that natural products embody more ''privileged structures'' [11] than purely synthetic chemical libraries and possess the characteristics and therapeutic effects of Chinese herbs [12] . Natural product-based drug discovery research programs represent important avenues for drug development [13] , including antiviral drugs [14, 15] . For example, emodin (1,3,8-tri-hydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an active ingredient sourced from herbs belonging to genera Rheum, Polygonum, Rhamnus and Senna. Extracts from these herbs have been used for the treatment of epidemic-prone diseases [16] . Emodin has been shown to inhibit the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus [17] , hepatitis B (HBV) [18] , and herpes simplex viruses (HSV) [19] .",

Subsequently, these samples were centrifuged at 3000 rounds per minute for 20 min and then the supernatant containing the virus was collected. Intracellular virus and total virus were obtained by centrifugation at 30 000 rounds per minute for three hours with 30% sucrose using a type 70.1 Ti Rotor in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (Optimal L-100XP ultracentrifuge Beckman Coulter). The samples were then collected for Western blot analysis. For determining cyclin A2 and CDK 2 expression, cells were collected at 36 h after EV71 infection and lysed directly in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer [60 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromophenol blue], followed by boiling for 10 min. Whole-cell lysates were further subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and detected with the corresponding primary and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The membranes were then reacted with 5-bromo-4-chloro-39-indolylphosphate (BCIP) and nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT) substrate (Sigma). The anti-CDK 2 (Boster) and anti-cyclin A2 (Proteintech) mouse or rabbit antibodies were used in the Western blot analyses. Anti-VP1 polyclonal antibodies from rabbit were prepared in our laboratory. Rabbit or mouse secondary antibodies were obtained from Proteintech. The intensity of the bands was calculated by ImageJ (NIH ImageJ), and the value of the Con/Drug refers to the intensity of the VP1 protein band from the control group/the intensity of the VP1 protein band of the drug treatment group in the supernatant, intracellular and total virus. Quantitative real-time PCR RNA was extracted from infected cells treated control medium and drugs using the Trizol reagent (Gibco-BRL, Rockville, MD, USA) and isolated as specified by the manufacturer. The RNA was treated with DNAse (DNase I-RNase-Free, Ambion) to remove any contaminating DNA. Then, 200 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with oligo dT primers using the High Capacity cDNA RT Kit (Applied Biosystems) in a 20 \u00b5L cDNA reaction as specified by the manufacturer. For quantitative PCR, the template cDNA was added to a 20 \u00b5L reaction with SYBR GREEN PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 0.2 \u00b5mol/L of primers for VP1 and GAPDH.",

MRC5 are human lung fibroblast cells. Although EV71 infection mainly leads to central nervous system symptoms, the lungs can also be infected by the EV71 virus in vivo [24] , meaning that MRC5 cells can be used as a cell model. The cell inhibitory ratio was detected via MTT analysis at 48 h post-treatment. After 48 h of treatment with 0, 13.69, 27.38, 54.77, 82.15, 109.53, and 136.92 \u00b5mol/L of Rheum emodin, the concentrations with inhibitory ratios below 10% ranged from 0 to 82.15 \u00b5mol/L ( Figure 1A ). After 0, 1, 5, 25, 50, 75, and 85 \u00b5mol/L of Artemisinin or Astragaloside treatment for 48 h, the concentrations of Artemisinin with inhibitory ratios below 10% ranged from 0 to 75 \u00b5mol/L ( Figure 1B ) and the concentration of Astragaloside with inhibitory ratios below 10% ranged from 0 to 85 \u00b5mol/L ( Figure 1C) . Therefore, the range of concentrations for Rheum emodin (0 to 82.15 \u00b5mol/L), Artemisinin (0 to 75 \u00b5mol/L) and Astragaloside (0 to 85 \u00b5mol/L) did not affect cell survival. Based on the results of both a published study [25] [26] [27] and our MTT assay, we chose the following concentrations for further study: 29.60 \u00b5mol/L of Rheum emodin, 50 \u00b5mol/L of Artemisinin or 50 \u00b5mol/L of Astragaloside for anti-EV71 activity.

There were no effects observed for either cell viability or morphology in the infected cells ( Figure  2A2 , 2A3, and 2A4) when compared with mock-infected cells ( Figure 2A1 ). Meanwhile, it was observed that numerous cells were rounded up and detached from the bottom of the dish in the cell morphological analysis ( Figure 2B1 ) compared to the mock-infected cells at 24 h post-infection of EV71 infection at a MOI of 1 ( Figure 2A1 ). While Rheum emodin treatment ( Figure 2B2 ) inhibited cell morphologic changes including being rounded up and detached from the bottom of the dish due to EV71 infection, Artemisinin ( Figure 2B3 ) and Astragaloside ( Figure 2B4 ) did not. Nuclear staining tests were also completed to confirm the effects of Rheum emodin, Artemisinin and Astragaloside on cell death. After the EV71-infected cell nuclei became condensed and bright ( Figure 2C1 ), which indicated cell death, Rheum emodin treatment inhibited the appearance of condensed and bright nuclei induced by EV71 infection (Figure 2C2 ), while neither Artemisinin ( Figure 2C3 ) nor Astragaloside inhibited cell death induced by EV71 infection ( Figure 2C4 ). Therefore, Rheum emodin possessed the ability to protect host cells from EV71 viral damage, while Artemisinin or Astragaloside were unable to achieve the same results.",

To further emphasize the effects of Rheum emodin, Artemisinin and Astragaloside treatment on S phase in EV71-infected cells, we analyzed the percentage of S phase cells after EV71 infection. The percentage of S phase cells after Rheum emodin treatment was 55.78% of that observed in the mock-treated cells ( Figure 5C ). The corresponding S phase percentages in the Astragaloside-and Artemisinin-treated cells were 90.68% ( Figure 5E ) and 88.11% of mock-treated cells ( Figure 5G ), respectively.

Effect of Rheum emodin, Artemisinin and Astragaloside on viral protein expression To further confirm the effects of the drugs on viral protein expression, we assessed EV71 viral protein expression using Western blot at 26 h and 36 h post-infection. Intracellular viral proteins were collected by cell lysis, the supernatant viral proteins by ultracentrifugation of viruses present in the culture medium, and the total viral proteins by ultracentrifugation of the cellular and medium viruses.

Rheum emodin also suppressed viral replication for 36 h. Similar anti-EV71 effects were not observed for either Artemisinin or Astragaloside. It should be noted from practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine that the three natural products Rheum emodin, Artemisinin, and Astragaloside were extracted from Chinese rhubarb (also from Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb.et Zucc; Rumex patientia Linn; Fagopyrum dibotrys (D Don) Hara; Rumex japonicus Houtt; Fallopia multiflora (Thunb) Harald), Artemisia carvifolia and Astragalus, respectively.
