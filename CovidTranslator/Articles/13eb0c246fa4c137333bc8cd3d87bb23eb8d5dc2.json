Skin cells from an odd-eyed, all-white male cat (G0 donor cat) were used to generate a cloned cat (G1 cloned cat). At 6 months of age, skin cells from the G1 cloned cat were used for SCNT to produce second-generation cloned cats. We compared the in vitro and in vivo development of SCNT embryos that were derived from the G0 donor and G1 cloned donor cat's skin fibroblasts. The nuclei from the G0 donor and G1 cloned donor cat's skin fibroblasts fused with enucleated oocytes with equal rates of fusion (60.7% vs. 58.8%, respectively) and cleavage (66.3% vs. 63.4%). The 2-4-cell SCNT embryos were then transferred into recipients. One of the five recipients of G0 donor derived NT embryos (20%) delivered one live male cloned kitten, whereas 4 of 15 recipients of the G1 cloned donor cat derived NT embryos (26%) delivered a total of seven male second-generation cloned kittens (four live kittens from one surrogate, plus two stillborn kittens, and one live kitten that died 2 d after birth from three other surrogate mothers). The four second-generation cloned kittens from the same surrogate all had a white coat color; three of the four second-generation cloned kittens had two blue eyes, and one of the second-generation cloned kittens had an odd-eye color. Despite low cloning efficiency, cloned cats can be used as donor cats to produce second-generation cloned cats. #",

We are striving to improve feline SCNT, with a long-term goal of efficiently producing genetically identical cats. Nuclear transfer has progressed from a novel technology to: (1) a widely used technique for generating identical individuals; (2) a model for understanding the cellular and molecular aspects of nuclear reprogramming; and most recently, (3) a means to produce embryonic stem cells for potential use in cell-based therapies [1] . Nuclear transfer in domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) was first demonstrated by the birth of a cloned kitten following the transfer of embryos that were reconstructed by www.theriojournal.com Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Theriogenology 69 (2008) 1001-1006 inserting cumulus cells into enucleated oocytes [2] . Feline SCNT cloning has a potential application for preserving endangered felids [1, 3] . Most wild felids are threatened, and the feasibility of using this technology to preserve endangered felids was demonstrated with the birth of African wildcat (Felis silivestris lybica) cloned kittens [1] . Moreover, despite the high rates of fetal and newborn mortality, surviving cloned cats are generally normal and healthy [2, 4, 5] . Serial cloning has been successful in several species, including pigs [6, 7] , mice [8] , and bulls [9, 10] .",

Moreover, second-generation cloning of existing cloned fetuses or animals has the distinct advantage of reproducing unique genetic characteristics. For example, transgenic cell populations that were produced by random gene insertion exhibit many different transgene integration sites and copy numbers. Using these transgenic cell populations in SCNT could facilitate production of fetuses or animals derived from a small subset of unique cells that would be difficult to isolate from the transgenic donor fetuses or animals. Although serial cloning of adult mice, cattle, and pigs has been reported [7, 14, 15] , there are no reports on second-generation cloning of felid species. The objective of the present study was to determine the efficiency of second-generation cloning, namely, producing cloned cats using skin cells from an adult cloned cat.",

The protruding first polar body and chromatin plate were removed with a beveled micropipette mounted on micromanipulators (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan), while being viewed with an inverted microscope (Nikon, Kanagawa, Japan) using Hoffman modulation contrast optics. Successful enucleation was confirmed by staining oocytes with 5 mg/mL of Hoechst 33342 and observing them with a fluorescent microscope under ultraviolet light. Donor cells were then dissociated using 1% trypsin-EDTA and placed in Ca 2+ -and Mg 2+free D-PBS supplemented with 0.3% BSA (fatty acid free, A-6003). Micromanipulation was used to place a single donor cell nucleus into the perivitelline space of each enucleated oocyte. The cytoplast/cell couples were equilibrated in 0.3 M mannitol containing 0.1 mM Mg 2+ and transferred to an electrofusion chamber containing the same medium. Cell fusion was induced by applying 2.0 kV/cm and 20 ms DC pulses (2\u00c2) delivered by an electro cell fusion generator (Nepagene, Chiba, Japan). The couples were removed from the fusion chamber, washed and incubated in TCM199 supplemented with 0.3% BSA at 38 8C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in air. One hour after electrofusion, the fused couples were equilibrated in 0.3 M mannitol containing 0.1 mM Ca 2+ and 0.1 mM Mg 2+ , placed into a fusion chamber containing the same medium, and electropulsed by applying 1.0 kV/cm and 20 ms DC pulses, 0.1 s apart (2\u00c2).

Of the seven second-generation cloned kittens, two (from S7 and S8) were stillborn and one (from S9) died a few days after birth because the surrogate mother refused to allow it to suckle. The remaining four kittens were from surrogate S6; photographs of these second-generation kittens at 1 and 4 months of age are shown (Fig. 1b and c) . The S1 from the G0 donor cat was delivered by C-section 66 d after embryo transfer, whereas S6-S9 from the G1 cloned cat were delivered naturally after 60-71 d ( Table 2 ). The pregnancy periods were not significantly different between the G0 and G1 cloned donor derived cloned cats. At 6 months of age, the G1 cloned cat had two blue eyes and an all-white coat. Although all of the secondgeneration cloned cats had an all-white coat at 4 months of age, their eye color varied, with three of the cats having two blue eyes, and one expressing the odd-eye phenotype.

            "text": "The domestic cat has several distinctive characteristics, including a close genetic relationship to the human genome [11, 12] . Cats, like dogs, have had intensive veterinary medical surveillance that has described 200 genetic diseases analogous to human disorders [16] [17] [18] . Feline infectious agents offer powerful natural models of deadly human diseases, including feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-AIDS, feline coronavirus (FeCoV)-SARS, avian influenza, canine distemper virus (CDV)-neurotropic viruses, and feline leukemia and sarcoma virus (FeLV, FeSV)leukemia and sarcoma [17, 19] . Cloning cats may be useful for generating transgenic animals that can serve as models of human diseases. We previously reported that SCNT can be used to produce viable first generation cloned cats [4, 5] . In the current study, we tested whether it was possible to produce viable second-generation cloned cats. In that regard, SCNT using skin cells that were collected from a 6-month-old cloned cat (G1 cloned cat) resulted in seven second-generation cloned cats. Their clonal status was confirmed by nine sets of microsatellite markers. Furthermore, the efficiency of the production of second-generation cloned cats was similar to the clones derived from the G0 donor cat (26 and 20% delivery rate in the cloned and secondgeneration cloned cats, respectively). Similarly, in previous second-generation cloning studies in mice, cumulus cells derived from donor mice and their adult clones produced clones equally as efficiently [8] ; 2.8 and 2.0% of the transferred cloned and re-cloned embryos developed to term. There were no changes in the cloned mice that influenced the subsequent cloning efficiency [8] ; however, the success rate dropped in successive cloned generations, such that re-cloning was no longer successful after the fifth generation [15] . Another re-cloning study using cattle examined embryos that were generated by SCNT using adult cells from a bull and fetal cells from the bull's clone [9] . Regardless of the nucleus donor, 28% of the fused embryos developed to the blastocyst stage. Moreover, based on DNA analysis and morphological observations, the re-cloned fetus that was removed at 56 d of pregnancy appeared to be normal [10] . Our data were consistent with these observations, and indicated that the efficiency of second-generation cloned cat production was similar to that of first-generation cloning.",

We found that the cloned cats that were derived from the odd-eyed cat were not carbon copies of the donor, as they usually lacked its odd-eye phenotype. However, the rationale was unclear. Perhaps the donor cells accumulated spontaneous mutations during cell division in vivo, or, more likely, accumulated mutations during their in vitro propagation [22] , and the mutations happened to occur during the cloning process [23] . Additional studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms responsible for the aberrant eye color of the cloned offspring.",

Therefore, cloned cats can be used as donor cats for the production of second-generation cloned cats by SCNT, although the cloning efficiency was low.",
