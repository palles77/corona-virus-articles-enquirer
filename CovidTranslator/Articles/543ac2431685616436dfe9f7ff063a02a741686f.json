In a recent study of dogs with acute diarrhea in the United Kingdom, the most common treatments were dietary modification (66% of cases) and antimicrobial treatment (63% of cases). 1 Previous studies have reported that up to 71% of dogs with acute diarrhea are treated with antimicrobials 3 despite emerging evidence that antimicrobial treatment is not effective in dogs with hemorrhagic or uncomplicated acute diarrhea. 6, 7 Consequently, acute diarrhea represents a considerable portion of antimicrobial usage in veterinary practice.",

            "text": "Recent evidence suggests that the fecal microbiome is altered in dogs with acute diarrhea, [8] [9] [10] identifying modulation of the microbiome as a potential therapeutic target. Probiotics and prebiotics are defined as live microorganisms that confer a health benefit to the host when delivered in adequate amounts 11 and substrates that selectively promote the growth of microorganisms that confer a health benefit, 12 respectively. There is evidence that probiotics and prebiotics are capable of altering the microbiome of dogs. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Probiotics and prebiotics favorably modulate gastrointestinal health by diverse mechanisms, but few studies have investigated the mechanism of action of putative probiotics in dogs. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] In predominantly in vitro, ex vivo, and rodent studies, probiotics and prebiotics have been shown to inhibit the growth of gastrointestinal pathogens, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] to improve gastrointestinal barrier function, and to favorably modulate the immune system. [33] [34] [35] [36] The extent to which these findings can be extrapolated to dogs is unknown. There is growing evidence in both the human and veterinary medical fields for the therapeutic potential of probiotics and prebiotics in treating and preventing acute diarrhea. A meta-analysis of 63 studies found that the administration of probiotics shortened the duration of clinical signs and decreased stool frequency in acute infectious diarrhea in humans. 37 44 Despite a lack of evidence for strain E. faecium 4b1707 in the treatment of acute diarrhea in dogs, antidiarrheal probiotic pastes (ADPPs) containing this probiotic are available. Our aim was to characterize the effect of a commercially available ADPP containing E. faecium 4b1707 (Pro-Kolin Advanced; PKA) on the clinical outcome of dogs with acute diarrhea. Specifically, we sought to identify whether the ADPP was associated with a shorter duration of acute diarrhea and a decrease in the number of dogs requiring additional medical intervention (AMI).",

The cause of diarrhea was not investigated. Dogs were excluded from the study if their clinical signs were deemed unsuitable for conservative management by the attending veterinary surgeon or if they had received antibiotic or probiotic treatment in the 4 weeks before Day 0 of the study. A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is presented in the Supporting Information S1. Ethical approval was obtained from an independent welfare representative of Charles River Laboratories (Tranent, UK). A sample size of 43 cases per group was required based on the primary objective of identifying a difference in equality of survival curves in the proportion of dogs being free from diarrhea on day 3 using a 2-sided log rank test with a significance level of P < .05 and power of 80%; therefore, a target of 50 cases per group was set. The sample size calculation was based on 80% of dogs in the ADPP group and 50% of dogs in the Placebo group being free from diarrhea on Day 3. One hundred forty-eight dogs that fulfilled the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to receive either the ADPP (ADPP group) or a placebo paste (Placebo group) in a ratio of 1 : 1. The ADPP was a paste for PO administration containing E. faecium 4b1707, Preplex prebiotic, combined kaolin and montmorillonite clay, psyllium, pectin, and beta glucan (PKA; Protexin Veterinary, Somerset, UK). The placebo was indistinguishable in packaging, appearance, and sensory properties from the ADPP to study personnel. The ADPP and placebo were dosed q8h according to the dogs' body weight on Day 0. Details of the ADPP and placebo composition and the dosing regimen can be found in Supporting Information S2. All dogs received concurrent treatment with a highly digestible diet (Hills i/d, Topeka, Kansas) in place of their usual food. Dogs were treated with both the PO administered paste and diet until the dog had either completed or was withdrawn from the study, up to a maximum of 10 days, with completion defined as the passage of 3 consecutive feces of normal consistency.",

Existing evidence suggests that probiotics can exert a beneficial effect on gastrointestinal health in dogs. 16 Probiotics have been shown to accelerate the resolution of nonspecific acute diarrhea, [41] [42] [43] improve the outcome of parvoviral enteritis in puppies, 46 Compliance with the ADPP was high and comparable with the study diet. Fewer than 3% of owners involved in the study were unable to administer either the study diet or the ADPP or placebo pastes. In order for the study to accurately reflect field conditions, dogs that missed doses of the ADPP or placebo were not censored in the analysis, provided they had not missed >2 doses on a single day and providing the dosing interval did not exceed 24 hours. Our results should be interpreted in the context of limitations in the study design. First, it was assumed that the placebo paste would have no effect on the outcome of acute diarrhea, but differences in the macronutrient profile of the ADPP and placebo could have influenced the duration of diarrhea. For example, the fat content of the placebo was slightly lower than that of the ADPP (39% and 42%, respectively). A low-fat diet is commonly recommended in dogs with acute diarrhea because of the effect of dietary fat on gastrointestinal motility and the possibility that undigested fat in the colon could exacerbate diarrhea. [50] [51] [52] [53] However, the small difference in fat content between the ADPP and placebo was deemed unlikely to affect clinical outcome in the context of the total dietary intake of macronutrients.",

Our study provides evidence that a synbiotic containing E. faecium 4b1707 may exert a therapeutic benefit in pet dogs with acute diarrhea.The study population was selected to represent the population of pet dogs that present to veterinarians for acute, nonspecific diarrhea.Diarrhea resolved in the majority of dogs in both treatment groups within 72 hours of enrollment, and with the exception of dogs that were withdrawn because of non-improvement or deterioration, diarrhea resolved in all dogs within 7 days. The 2 treatment groups were comparable at the start of the study in terms of their demographic diversity, disease severity, and product acceptance. The ADPP led to a statistically significant decrease in the duration of diarrhea of 15 hours, which is of questionable clinical relevance. However, the ADPP offered a more convincing clinical benefit in a decrease in AMI Duration of diarrhea was significantly shorter in the ADPP group compared to the Placebo group.

Few studies demonstrate the efficacy of dietary modulation with either proprietary or home-cooked diets, and some evidence suggests that antimicrobial treatment is not effective in dogs with acute diarrhea.6,7 The ADPP could decrease antimicrobial usage both by a shift in prescribing habits away from the use of antimicrobials in favor of the ADPP in dogs with acute diarrhea and by a decrease in antimicrobial use in those dogs given the ADPP that would otherwise have required AMI.",

            "text": ", the effect of management was likely to differentially affect dogs with small bowel and large bowel diarrhea, with dogs having the latter disorder being more likely to defecate indoors than dogs with small bowel diarrhea because of a greater urgency to defecate. The proportion of dogs with small versus large bowel diarrhea in the study was unknown, and therefore differences in this variable between the 2 groups could have confounded the results. Taken together, it is possible that the measurement of duration of diarrhea in terms of hours was overly sensitive, but it was deemed pragmatic in the context of a field study, and measurement with a lower granularity could have adversely impaired the ability to compare the 2 groups. A further limitation of the study design was reliance on owners' recollection of the consistency of the dog's last feces before enrollment to compare disease severity atDay 0 between the 2 groups. Collection of data about the number and duration of episodes of diarrhea before enrollment was not performed because of expected inaccuracies in the recollection of complex data and the possibility that not all carer-givers of the dog were present at enrollment. Consequently, the 2 groups may have differed in disease severity at enrollment. Finally, all dogs were fed a single, proprietary highly digestible diet, and therefore it is unclear how the ADPP would perform in comparison to other control groups (such as dogs in which different dietary modulations are performed) or in the absence of dietary modulation. There also are limitations in the scope of our study. The ADPP contained a number of active ingredients, which confers 2 key restrictions to the interpretation of the study findings. First, it is unclear to what extent each active ingredient contributed to the positive effect identified for the ADPP, and consequently further work is necessary to elucidate the mechanism of action of the ADPP. The ADPP could act by mechanisms such as inhibition of pathogen growth; 29,30 modulation of gastrointestinal immune function, 18,33,35,54-56 the gastrointestinal microbiome, 13,17,18,20,35,56-58 or gastrointestinal motility; 58 the binding of water and toxins; 59-62 or any combination of these factors. Second, the use of a compound formulation limits the extent to which our findings can be extrapolated to other commercially available ADPPs. Because of heterogeneity in the composition of proprietary ADPPs, small differences in either the combination of, quantity of, or source of active ingredients could affect the efficacy of different ADPPs. For example, intraspecies variation in E. faecium could lead to heterogeneity in the behavior of different probiotic strains of E. faecium. 63 Further studies using single active ingredients would provide information about the relative importance of individual components of the ADPP in dogs with acute diarrhea.",
