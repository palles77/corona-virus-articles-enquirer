Many successful pathogens have acquired sophisticated mechanisms to regulate the NF-\u03baB signalling pathways by deploying subversive proteins or hijacking the host signalling molecules.

The mammalian NF-\u03baB proteins are members of the Rel domain-containing protein family: RELA (also known as p65), RELB, c-REL, the NF-\u03baB p105 subunit (also known as NF-\u03baB1; which is cleaved into the p50 subunit) and the NF-\u03baB p100 subunit (also known as NF-\u03baB2; which is cleaved into the p52 subunit); these proteins can homodimerize or heterodimerize through their conserved Rel homology domain to mediate gene transcription 1,2 . NF-\u03baB proteins are activated by a variety of diverse extracellular or intracellular stimuli, including microbial pathogens and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) 3 . The NF-\u03baB signalling pathway is an attractive target for exploitation by microbial pathogens in order to modulate host cell events, as activation of NF-\u03baB is such a rapid response. Cytoplasmic NF-\u03baB complexes are transferred to the nucleus within minutes after exposure to a pathogen or PAMPs, even in the absence of de novo protein synthesis, and induce the expression of a broad spectrum of antimicrobial pro-inflammatory cellular response genes 4,5 . The central role of these transcription factors in pathogen defence is highlighted by the fact that the NF-\u03baB signalling cascade is probably the most frequently targeted intracellular pathway for subversion by anti-immune modulators that are encoded by a wide spectrum of microbial pathogens 4 . In this Review, we describe some of the recent advances in our understanding of the various mechanisms used by pathogens to modulate NF-\u03baB signalling.",

In response to diverse stimuli, various cellular immune receptors (such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs)) and cytokine receptors (such as the interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs), TNF receptors (TNFRs) and other TNFR-like receptors) can rapidly activate the NF-\u03baB complex following the appropriate pro-inflammatory stimulation. This activation is mediated by a signalling cascade that uses multiple adaptors (including TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs), myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MYD88) and TIR domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP)), as well as intermediate transducing molecules and kinases (including IL-1R-associated kinases (IRAKs), receptor-interacting proteins (RIPs; also known as RIPKs) and NF-\u03baB-inducing kinase (NIK; also known as MAP3K14)), to eventually lead to degradation of the inhibitory protein I\u03baB\u03b1, thus liberating the NF-\u03baB complexes for transport to the nucleus, where they undergo further layers of regulation 7 (FIG. 1) .",

Activation of the IKK complex induces phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, followed by ubiquitylation by a specific cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) family SCF \u03b2TRCP complex, which contains SKP1 (S phase kinase-associated protein 1), cullin 1 and the F-box protein \u03b2TRCP as substrate adaptor; this SCF \u03b2TRCP complex specifically recognizes and degrades I\u03baB\u03b1 that is phosphorylated on Ser32 and Ser36. As well as processing I\u03baB\u03b1, the ubiquitylation-proteasome pathway is important for the processing of NF-\u03baB subunits p105 and p100 to p50 and p52, respectively 10 . In addition to the IKK complex, members of the IKK family of kinases -including IKKi (inducible IKK; also known as IKK\u03b5) and TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1) -can activate the NF-\u03baB pathway in response to microbial infection 11 . TBK1 interacts with TANK, a TRAF-binding protein that activates NF-\u03baB by modulating the function of TRAF2 and that also interacts with IKKi. TBK1 enhances the enzymatic activity of IKK\u03b2 by direct phosphorylation, and thus contributes to NF-\u03baB activation 12 . Because of the essential role of IKKs and I\u03baB\u03b1 in the activation and regulation of NF-\u03baB signalling, these proteins (or their post-translational modifications) are often targeted directly by microbial pathogens to control the host immune responses.",

In the classical pathway (for example, triggered by TNFR1 signalling), IKK\u03b2 and NEMO become activated by adaptors (such as TRAFs) and then phosphorylate p105 and I\u03baB\u03b1 to release the prototypical heterodimer p50-RELA. In the alternative pathway (for example, triggered by lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor), IKK\u03b1 is activated by NIK and then phosphorylates p100, which is subsequently cleaved to form p52. p52 then forms a heterodimer with RELB and translocates to the nucleus. This alternative pathway is triggered by a subset of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) family members, including CD40, lymphotoxin-\u03b2, B cell-activating factor (BAFF), receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) and TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK). By contrast, inflammatory cytokines, genotoxic stress, antigens and TLR stimulation tend to activate the classical pathway. Both the classical and alternative pathways are modulated by microbial pathogens, as the two pathways induce coordinated immune responses following diverse infections.",

The presence of a functional NF-\u03baB signalling cascade in the horseshoe crab, a species that is known as a 'living fossil', suggests that the proteins involved are the evolutionarily conserved immune defence molecules 15 , and highlights the central role of NF-\u03baB in upregulating the expression of genes encoding chemokines, cytokines, adhesion molecules (such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1)), enzymes that produce secondary inflammatory mediators, and inhibitors of apoptosis. These molecules are key components of the innate immune response to invading microorganisms and are required for the migration of inflammatory and phagocytic cells to the site of infection, where NF-\u03baB has been activated. The activated phagocytic cells kill, ingest and degrade microbial pathogens and eventually present the antigens to T cells after they re-migrate to secondary lymphoid organs. The secreted cytokines, including TNF and IL-1\u03b2, also start a feedback loop for a second phase of NF-\u03baB activation that continues the induction of robust immune responses. The cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as TLRs, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), which all sense microbial pathogens and PAMPs, use distinct signalling pathways that eventually converge to activate NF-\u03baB 16 , leading to the production of inflammatory mediators.",

The importance of NF-\u03baB in protection against pathogens is also supported by the fact that NF-\u03baB complexes are abundantly expressed in myeloid cells, which are mostly dedicated to innate immunity. The importance of members of the NF-\u03baB family in both the immune response against pathogens and the development and function of other immune cells has been demonstrated by sequentially knocking down the expression levels of these proteins 17 . Mice lacking different NF-\u03baB family members become susceptible to various viral, bacterial and parasitic infections (TABLE 1 ). In addition, IKK and IKK-related kinases also play an important part in regulating antimicrobial responses 11, 18 . As a result, pathogens have developed various mechanisms to alter the activation of NF-\u03baB. Here, we focus on the mechanisms by which viruses and bacteria modulate NF-\u03baB activation.",

For example, some viruses (such as the gammaherpesviruses Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)) activate NF-\u03baB during latency, whereas they tend to suppress NF-\u03baB signalling during the lytic cycle 20 . By contrast, viruses such as Sindbis virus, dengue virus and reoviruses activate NF-\u03baB to facilitate the induction of apoptosis, which increases viral spread via phagocytic myeloid cells. However, more often, viruses inhibit NF-\u03baB primarily to dampen host inflammatory and immune responses, often by encoding multiple proteins that target the pathways at multiple levels [21] [22] [23] . Larger DNA viruses, such as poxviruses, frequently deploy several proteins to regulate NF-\u03baB in cultured cells in a seemingly redundant manner, whereas smaller RNA viruses may encode only a single protein that has multiple roles in regulating NF-\u03baB.

            "text": "Some viruses have evolved mechanisms to pro-actively stimulate NF-\u03baB activation 19, 21, 24 . Viruses such as HIV-1, human T-lymphotrophic virus 1 (HTLV-1), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), rotaviruses, influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs) activate NF-\u03baB to promote viral replication and to pre-empt virus-induced apoptosis (FIG. 2) . These viral genomes all possess strategic gene promoters with NF-\u03baB-binding sites and, thus, activated NF-\u03baB is crucial for viral gene expression, replication and spread. Infections with RSVs, the causative agents of acute respiratory diseases such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia, are associated with excessive inflammation caused by the release of NF-\u03baB-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by airway epithelial cells 25 . This occurs because the infection induces a persistent activation of both classical and alternative NF-\u03baB pathways 25 . The classical NF-\u03baB pathway is activated by the host superoxidegenerating enzyme NOX2-containing NADPH oxidase, which phosphorylates I\u03baB\u03b1 and RELA in airway epithelial cells via RIG-I (also known as DDX58), TRAF6 and IKK\u03b2 26 . However, the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway is activated by the kinases NIK and IKK\u03b1, leading to the nuclear translocation of p52-RELB 27 . This suggests that the redox modification mediated by RSVs might have multiple upstream targets that then lead to the activation of both NF-\u03baB pathways. Two of the RSV proteins, fusion glycoprotein F and M2-1, have been shown to activate NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine induction in monocytic cells 28, 29 .",

In most cases, virus-encoded oncoproteins are directly involved in this activation process. Among the oncoproteins identified so far, the mechanisms of persistent NF-\u03baB activation by Tax1 from HTLV-1 and Tax2 from HTLV-2 during T cell leukaemia are well established 34, 35 . Tax1 primarily activates the IKK complex by directly interacting with the non-catalytic subunit, NEMO 36 . In addition, Tax1 modulates the activity of kinases that activate the IKK complex, such as MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1; also known as MAP3K1), NIK and TGF\u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1; also known as MAP3K7) (REF. 37) . Recently, it was demonstrated that Tax1 sequesters the activated IKK complex in lipid rafts through its interaction with NEMO, providing an optimal microenvironment for kinase activation and thus allowing constitutive activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway 38 . Unlike Tax2, Tax1 also modulates the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway by upregulating IKK\u03b1 in T cells, thereby inducing the processing of p100 (REF. 39 ). Another member of the Retroviridae, bovine foamy virus (BFV), activates the classical and alternative NF-\u03baB pathways using the viral transactivator BTas, which interacts with IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 and persistently activates NF-\u03baB 40 .",

At later stages of EBV infection, B cells are immortalized, in part owing to the activation of NF-\u03baB by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), which mimics a constitutively activated TNFR 42 . LMP1 activates both the alternative and the classical NF-\u03baB pathways using its carboxy-terminal activation region 1 (CTAR1) and CTAR2, respectively 43, 44 .

Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MuHV-68), which establishes long-term latent infection in the mouse spleen, initiates lytic replication using its RTA protein (encoded by ORF50) in latently infected cells. MuHV-68 activates IKK\u03b2 in a MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein)-dependent manner through phosphorylation of RTA, to promote the lytic replication cycle 55 , although a previous study reported that the NF-\u03baB pathway is dispensable for MuHV-68 lytic replication 56 . HBV, which causes hepatocellular carcinoma (the most common form of liver cancer in adults), can persistently activate NF-\u03baB using the transcriptional transactivator protein HBx (also known as protein X) 57 . Several mechanisms have been proposed for the induction of NF-\u03baB target genes by HBx, including direct targeting of the NF-\u03baB components and, as an indirect route, activation of cellular kinases that induce transcription of cellular genes containing \u03baB elements (sequences to which NF-\u03baB binds) in their promoters 58 . A complex consisting of HBx and RELA can activate the gene encoding metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1), which is a master chromatin modifier, and can regulate cancer progression, indicating the importance of NF-\u03baB upregulation 59 . HCV, which causes acute and chronic hepatitis, also persistently activates NF-\u03baB, leading to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The core and NS3 proteins of HCV activate NF-\u03baB by activating TNFR1 and TLRs 60 . Apart from using oncoproteins, viruses use homologues of cellular anti-apoptotic proteins as a survival strategy; for example, the African swine fever virus (ASFV) inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP), A224L, can activate NF-\u03baB using TRAF2 and IKK\u03b2, and can thus prevent apoptosis 61 .",

As mentioned above, some viruses (for example, HSV spp.), maintain a delicate balance between activation and suppression of NF-\u03baB in order to maintain long-term persistence. Activation of NF-\u03baB is required to start the infection and viral replication; however, NF-\u03baB signalling also promotes the expression of inflammatory cytokines, and several viral proteins -the immediate-early proteins of HSV, for example -block NF-\u03baB activation at a later stage to ensure a smooth progression of infection. The HSV immediate-early protein ICP0, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, reduces TLR2-mediated inflammatory responses against the virus by inducing degradation of the adaptor protein MYD88 (REF. 65 ), whereas ICP27, another immediate-early protein, represses NF-\u03baB function by stabilizing I\u03baB\u03b1 through blockade of its phosphorylation and ubiquitylation 66 . This suggests that bifunctional viral proteins such as ICP27, which activate as well as suppress NF-\u03baB, have complex regulatory duties that function to maintain a delicate balance between advantageous and deleterious host responses.",

Vaccinia virus (VACV), the prototypical orthopoxvirus, encodes a remarkable NF-\u03baB tool kit that includes multiple inhibitory proteins -such as A46R, A52R, B14, K1L M2L and N1L -all of which block activation of the IKK complex and inhibit degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, albeit using diverse mechanisms [76] [77] [78] [79] . Among these, B14 inhibits NF-\u03baB by directly targeting IKK\u03b2 of the IKK complex 80 . Interestingly, the B14 counterpart in the attenuated virus modified virus Ankara (MVA), encoded by ORF183 and lacking six amino acids that are present in \u03b1-helix 6 of B14, cannot inhibit NF-\u03baB activation 81 ; as a result, MVA infection activates NF-\u03baB, whereas VACV infection inhibits NF-\u03baB very quickly after activating it. The VACV proteins E3L, K1L and N1L use multiple targets, as they all block both NF-\u03baB and antiviral pathways 82, 83 . Molluscum contagiosum virus (MOCV) protein MC159 is a vFLIP that inhibits FAS-mediated apoptosis and TNF-induced late activation of NF-\u03baB.

The human coxsackievirus B3 protease 3C cleaves I\u03baB\u03b1 to create an aminoterminal fragment that interacts with RELA and translocates with it to the nucleus, where the complex therefore remains inactive 89 . This blockade of NF-\u03baB activation induces apoptosis of infected cells. Another protease, amino-terminal protease (Npro) from classical swine fever virus, also interacts with I\u03baB\u03b1 and modulates NF-\u03baB function 90 .",

NF-\u03baB is activated during the viral entry process, whereas HCMV successfully inhibits the NF-\u03baB pathway after the initial infection. HCMV immediate-early protein IE86 inhibits binding of NF-\u03baB to the promoters of interferon-\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2), cytokines and chemokines in response to TNF stimulation or virus infection 102 . However, IE86 does not block the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB or directly interact with the subunits, suggesting that the protein might target host factors required for the transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB. HCMV can also inhibit the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway that is induced by TNF and IL-1\u03b2 at later times post-infection, by inhibiting IKK activation using a late viral gene product 103, 104 . An HCMV-encoded homologue of human IL-10 also inhibits NF-\u03baB activation 105 . Like HCMV, reoviruses also modulate NF-\u03baB in a manner that promotes the viral life cycle in the infected host. For example, reovirus 3 strain Dearing activates NF-\u03baB to induce NF-\u03baB-dependent apoptosis 106 . However, another strain of reovirus 3 (strain Abney) inhibits NF-\u03baB at a later stage of infection to promote induction of apoptosis in HEK293 and primary cardiac myocytes.

These secretion systems are grouped into seven classes (type I to type VII) according to their protein composition and their mechanism of function 113 . Together, these secretion systems transport hundreds of virulence factors and effector proteins, but only a few of these have been characterized in detail. The known effector proteins that modulate host innate immune responses associated with the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway are primarily delivered by the type III secretion system (T3SS), as found in Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp., or by the type IV secretion system (T4SS), as found in Bartonella spp. Type III effector proteins from Yersinia spp., known as Yops, counteract multiple signalling pathways that are activated in the infected host cells 114 . For example, YopJ (also known as YopP in Yersinia enterocolitica) inhibits NF-\u03baB signalling to block the production of proinflammatory cytokines. However, multiple mechanisms of action were described for YopJ, as it has several protein targets in the NF-\u03baB pathway. YopJ was identified as a cysteine protease that also has deubiquitylating and desumoylating activity; it removes polyubiquitin chains from I\u03baB\u03b1 and therefore inhibits proteasomal degradation of the protein 115 . YopJ can also remove ubiquitin chains from TRAF6 to inhibit TLR-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB signalling 116 . In addition, it acts as an acetyltransferase that acetylates serine and threonine residues in the activation loops of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, thereby blocking phosphorylation and activation of the IKK complex by upstream kinases 117, 118 . Aeromonas salmonicida encodes AopP, a type III effector protein that is related to YopJ. Secretion of this effector prevents the nuclear translocation of RELA, but the direct host target of AopP is unknown. It does not inhibit the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, suggesting that AopP might prevent degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 using a similar mechanism to that used by YopJ 119 . Thus, YopJ (variants of which are encoded by multiple Gram-negative bacterial species) has acquired several mechanisms of inhibiting the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway.",

Another S. Typhimurium type III effector protein, SseL (encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island 2), also possesses a deubiquitylase activity that inhibits degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 124, 125 . S. Typhimurium lacking SseL causes increased NF-\u03baB activation in macrophages as a result of ubiquitin-mediated degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1.",

For example, in the intestine the expression pattern and localization of PRRs and the activation of NF-\u03baB pathways have an important role in maintaining homeostasis 144 . Some commensal bacteria produce proteins that suppress immune activation; for example, Lactobacillus reuteri, a beneficial organism that is exploited for probiotics, can downregulate NF-\u03baB-dependent host proteins that mediate cell proliferation and survival 145 . This species blocks nuclear translocation of RELA by preventing the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in response to TNF stimulation 145 , although, as shown by a recent study using the commensal intestinal bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum, changes in host cell gene expression can depend on the bacterial growth phase 146 . On the other hand, the effects of probiotics in the prevention or treatment of diarrhoea caused by infection with enteric pathogens (for example, Saccharomyces boulardii) are thought to be mediated by immune modulation and the release of proinflammatory cytokines that are regulated by NF-\u03baB 147 .

These pathogen-derived countermeasures have been selected to maintain a delicate balance between the activation and inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway as a survival strategy, and this supervening control has to be exercised throughout the time that the pathogen lives within the host. In fact, single pathogens frequently deploy multiple strategies to modulate the NF-\u03baB circuitry, but it is still a mystery why individual pathogens often need to express so many seemingly redundant regulators of the same pathway (for example, VACV encodes six known distinct NF-\u03baB regulators, and that number is still growing). It is also clear that diverse microbial pathogens have evolved, in parallel, the ability to manipulate common cellular targets to modulate the NF-\u03baB pathway. In fact, the pathogen-derived effector molecules themselves are remarkably diverse. With the continuing identification of ever more cellular mechanisms that regulate NF-\u03baB, it would not be surprising if at least some successful pathogens were shown to subvert these newly found regulatory mechanisms for their benefit. Furthermore, the identification of new pathogen-derived molecules that target NF-\u03baB will undoubtedly increase our appreciation of the most effective ways to manipulate NF-\u03baB therapeutically in uninfected hosts.",

Although the cause-and-effect relationships of NF-\u03baB activation in cancerous tissues are not completely understood, aberrant activation of kinase pathways that feed into the IKK proteins can constitutively activate NF-\u03baB and contribute to the progression of various malignancies 153 . It is not accidental that the major chemical and physical carcinogens that have been implicated in the promotion of cancer can also frequently activate NF-\u03baB. Newer drugs that inhibit NF-\u03baB by targeting upstream kinases in the pathway, and the IKK proteins, have shown promise as anticancer therapeutics in preclinical studies. However, it is worth remembering that successful pathogens are still Mother Nature's master drug chemists, and pathogen-derived molecules themselves (or derivatives of these molecules), such as bioactive peptides, may be developed as both anticancer and anti-inflammatory therapeutics in the future. Newer generations of drugs are needed to treat those immune diseases and cancers that depend on NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory support. Indeed, the 'right' druggable cellular targets have probably already been identified and targeted for exploitation by nature's successful microbial pathogens. Protein levels and activity of signalling molecules can be regulated through posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and acetylation. The activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) ultimately results in the transcription of genes that encode pro-inflammatory factors and factors that influence cell proliferation.
