Based on these data from government sources, we can calculate the exponential fit for these cases, as seen in Appendix, Figure 1 . The parameter values from this fit are shown in Table 1 . For policymakers to get a sense of how quickly the number of cases can grow across time, consider Appendix Figure 2 . As an illustrative example, consider the following. On March 20, 2020, there were 1,087 cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada. One week later, on March 27, 2020, the amount of cases is expected to more than quintuple to over 5,700, based on the exponential model. A week after that, on April 3, 2020, the number of cases is expected to reach 30,131, if current trends do not abate. These numbers will pose significant threats to ICU bed capacity, and the ability of hospitals to provide front-line medical staff with maximum personal protective equipment (PPE). Canada has ten provinces, four of which seem to be driving this exponential trend: British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta, and Quebec. As of March 20, 2020, 92 percent of Canada's COVID-19 cases come from these four provinces. These four provinces also contain 86 percent of Canada's population, and contain a number of other factors that make them more susceptible to disease transmission: densely populated urban areas, international and national travel hubs, and immigration. The same non-linear least squares method was applied to each individual province's number of COVID-19 case numbers, with results shown in Appendix Figure 3 (British Columbia), Figure 4 (Ontario), Figure 5 (Alberta), and Figure 6 (Quebec). In each of these provinces, an exponential fit appears to model the data well, strongly suggesting good prediction.",

However our models are consistent with other models of exponential growth, including those from Italy where the exponential growth pattern continues unabated. 5 Countries in Asia, including Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, have rapidly brought the COVID-19 outbreak under control, and have important lessons to teach European and North American nations struggling with exponential growth rates. Both these nations have used a multitude of early, aggressive interventions including rapid border controls, social distancing, the innovative and population-wide use of smart phone technology and the ubiquitous wearing of surgical masks in healthcare settings as well as the general population. 10 Apart from the late and uncertain adoption of social distancing, Canada has not been willing or able to learn from these countries' experience. In particular, there is not yet any attempt to mobilize smart phone technology or use face masks for all healthcare workers. Face masks have been shown to reduce infection rates in influenza epidemics and WHO officials have been shown in news media to be wearing face masks whilst addressing news 3 .

Smart phone technology adapted to Canadian needs would involve the creation of a national-level app which can be downloaded and used to track COVID-19 cases in real time, provide uniform updates on public policy and announcements; and make simple, consistent messaging available on a national scale. The ubiquitous use of face masks, at least in healthcare settings is a rapid adoption NPI which can have major impacts on COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality in Canada and elsewhere. 11 Policymakers in Canada should also implement a rapid roll out of policies that harness the power of smart phone technology [12] [13] [14] [15] and the wearing of face masks by the public. Unfortunately, the messaging in Canada has been counterproductive and has included various versions of \"face masks don't work unless properly used.\" This is the same as claiming that hand washing does not work, unless properly carried out. Both Taiwan and Hong Kong function as forms of democracies, not unlike Canada and the United States. It should therefore be possible to move with deliberate and urgent speed to implement policies that have been shown to work in these Asian countries. Mandating healthcare workers to wear a mask in work places is a good start. Failure to make bold and rapid moves based on the successful measures that have been implemented in Taiwan and Hong Kong is likely to prove very costly in terms of overloaded ICU resources, public mistrust of health officials and an exponential increase in morbidity and mortality, the latter of which were observed in countries like Italy.",
