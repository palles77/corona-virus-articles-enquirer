Objective : The present report analyse the discrepant results that could be obtained by the commercially available diagnostic tests and that can mask the reliable viral diagnosis. Study design : One fecal sample was collected from a hospitalized child aged 6 months with acute watery diarrhea and dehydration. The fecal specimen was processed the same day for the rotavirus and adenovirus antigen detection. Results : The sample was positive for rotavirus antigen by one-step membrane test based on immunochromatographic assays (ICA) and enzyme immunoassays (EIA) monoclonal test but it was negative by an EIA polyclonal test, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and RT-PCR assays. In the other hand, the sample was positive for adenovirus antigen by ICA and EIA adenovirus type 40/41. Finally, the sample showed by PAGE an electrophoretic profile resembled that of reovirus. Conclusion : The use of a wide repertory of diagnosis tests allowed to reach an unusual reovirus-adenovirus type 40/41 dual infection. This case also point out the potential participation of reovirus in the ethiology of the diarrhea illness.",

They are rotavirus, astrovirus, calicivirus including the Norwalk agent and enteric adenovirus type 40/41; today these viruses are called classic ethiologic agents of childhood diarrhea. On the other hand other viruses such as coronavirus, torovirus and reovirus are found only occasionally in fecal specimens and they are called unusual infectious agents.",

They have become standard methods since they are easy to perform, require no special equipment and provide results in a short turnaround time. Although the performances of these assays have been Abbreviations: RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; EIA, enzyme immunoassays; ICA, immunochromatographic assays improved, false positive results may be observed. On the other hand, electron microscopy (EM) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) are used as references methods for rotavirus detection because their high specificity; however, the equipment required is generally not found in diagnostic laboratories. More recently, probe assay and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were reported as the most sensitive methods but they are not used widely as a diagnostic tool.",

The fecal specimen was processed the same day, following the manufactured instructions, by a one-step membrane test based on immunochromatographic assays (ICA) (Diarlex MB, Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland) for rotavirus and adenovirus antigen detection. The test resulted positive for both viruses therefore it was informed as a rotavirus-adenovirus dual infection. Although manufacturer's instructions indicate that the relative intensities of the lines seen in the result window are irrelevant to the test result, we decided to re-test the stool sample because the rotavirus slightly weak line revealed. The specimen was assayed by two different EIAs (Rotazyme II, Abbot Laboratories, Diagnostics Division, Abbott Park, IL 60064 and Pathfinder TM Rotavirus, Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur, France) rendering negative and low positive photometric results respectively. The discordant results compelled us to restate about the ethiology of the child infection. In order to achieve a more reliable diagnosis, the specimen was assayed by the rotavirus reference assay, that is PAGE, and revealed by silver stain (Herring et al., 1982; Laemmli, 1970) . The electrophoretic pattern showed an RNA migration of 10 double stranded segments (three large, three medium and four small) which the characteristic genomic reovirus profile.",

Nevertheless, it could not be presumed that rotavirus was present in the stool sample at a very low concentration because the two techniques that rendered negative results (Rotazyme II and PAGE) are less sensitive than the monoclonal EIA. Thereby, the sample was assayed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplified directly from stool specimen the rotavirus gene segment coding for the major outer capsid glycoprotein VP 7. Rotavirus double-stranded RNA was extracted from the stool according to Boom's method (Boom et al., 1990) and used as the template for reverse transcription, which was then amplified using the Taq polymerase, according to Gouvea method (Gouvea et al., 1994) .

This unusual diagnostic situation illustrate that the use of different currently viral laboratory test kits could render not only discrepant results but also they could mask the accurate ethiology of viral gastroenteritis. Moreover, it must be taken account the potential participation of reovirus in the ethiology and severity of the diarrhea illness. A few isolated reports associating reovirus with human diarrhea have been presented (Giordano et al., 2002) .
