We confirmed that all of the mosquito populations carried the same DENV4 strain, assembled its full genome, validated infection orthogonally by reverse transcriptase PCR, traced the virus origin, estimated the time period of its introduction to the Caribbean region, as well as explored the viral genetic signatures and mosquito-specific virome associations that potentially mediated DENV4 persistence in mosquitoes. We discuss the significance of prolonged maintenance of these DENV4 infections in Ae. aegypti that occurred in the absence of a DENV4 human index case in Manatee County with respect to the inability of current surveillance paradigms to detect mosquito vector infections prior to a potential local outbreak.",

Since severe disease from DENV infections can manifest as dengue 4 hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome [1] , DENV establishment in the continental United 5 States is a major concern for public health agencies. In the USA, Florida has experienced 6 increases in local DENV transmission since 2009 [3] , driven in part by human and pathogen 7 movement. Ae. aegypti is endemic throughout subtropical Florida and the vector population 8 has resurged recently, following its near displacement by Ae. albopictus [4] . Autochthonous 9 DENV infection occurs sporadically, primarily in Southern Florida with limited local cases 10 elsewhere in the state [3] . In 2019, 16 cases of locally acquired DENV were reported for the 11 state, including an area along the West-Central Florida Gulf Coast. 12 13 Recently, reports have indicated that certain insect-specific viruses (ISVs) can negatively 14 impact or enhance arbovirus (including DENV) infections in insect cells [5, 6] and mosquitoes 15 [7] , respectively. Although the impacts of many ISVs on arboviral competence have yet to be 16 determined, the evidence to date clearly indicates that the mosquito virome cannot be safely 17 ignored and likely influences the risk of autochthonous DENV transmission once the virus is 18 introduced into an area. Therefore, we conducted a metaviromic study of F1 (first-generation, 19 lab-raised mosquitoes from wild parents) Ae. aegypti adult females collected as eggs from 20 ovitraps in 2016-2017 from Manatee County to assess the potential risk of flavivirus 21 transmission outside of Southern Florida.

Comparative selection and mutation analyses 119 revealed NS2A as a relatively strong region of potential selection for the Manatee County 120 genome. HyPhy algorithms were used to estimate non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) 121 codon substitution rate ratios (\u03c9), with \u03c9<1 indicating purifying/negative selection and \u03c9>1 122 indicating diversifying/positive selection [33, 34] . Fast, unconstrained Bayesian approximation 123 (FUBAR) [35] was used for inferring pervasive selection, and the mixed effects model of 124 evolution (MEME) [36] (Fig. 1a) . 151 A full DENV4 genome (MN192436) was constructed with an overall genome coverage of ~11X 152 across the reads (Fig. 2) . We observed that the 2017 DENV4 signal was much lower than 168 After analyzing the metavirome, we investigated the genome of the DENV4 strain to determine 169 its likely source and assess the potential timeframe of introduction into Florida. Our first 170 analysis confirmed the phylogenetic signal and absence of nucleotide substitution saturation 171 ( Fig. S2a-b) . We subsequently explored Manatee County DENV4's phylogeny with a 234-172 genome DENV4 dataset constructed from GenBank sequences (Table S1) by maximum 173 likelihood (ML) phylogenetic inference (Fig. 3a) . The ML phylogeny showed three clades: two 174 Asian clades, and one American clade with two Senegalese strains (MF00438, KF907503) and 175 one Thai (KM190936) at the base (Fig. 3a) . Manatee DENV4 can be classified as DENV4 176 genotype IIb. The DENV4 genome obtained in Florida most closely clustered with two Haitian 177 isolates from 2014 (KT276273, KP140942) and a cluster of Puerto Rican isolates (Fig. 3a) . 178 Further back, a Haitian isolate (JF262782) collected 20 years earlier also clustered with the 179 Manatee-associated clade (Fig. 3a) .",

The protein-coding regions of Manatee DENV4 215 were compared to four Haitian DENV4 genomes from 1994-2015 and a 1981 Senegalese 216 DENV4 genome. These were analyzed for all amino acid substitutions between strains, and a 217 dN/dS analysis was conducted comparing the Senegalese DENV4 genome with Manatee 218 DENV4 ( Fig. 4a and Table S2 ). The highest proportions of amino acid substitution were seen 219 in NS2A and the 2K peptide; simultaneously, the highest dN/dS values occurred for the NS2A 220 gene, to a point of weak positive selection (dN/dS > 1) that covered a V1238T mutation 221 discussed further herein. We then calculated dN/dS ratios for DENV4 altogether, genotype II, 222 genotype IIa, and genotype IIb with all sequences available, as well as within the Haiti-Florida 223 clade and the Haiti-Florida-Puerto-Rico clades (Fig. 4b) . Purifying selection, which occurs 224 when non-synonymous mutations are deleterious, dominated, but we found weaker purifying 225 selection in NS2A and 2K peptide genes, correlating to the Manatee-to-Senegal dN/dS 226 analysis conducted previously. Values of dN/dS for these genes increased relative to those for 227 flanking genes for genotype IIb and Caribbean/Florida-specific groups as well (Fig. 4b) .",

There was only one non-synonymous mutation among the 249 six genomes, which is significant considering the size of the 2K peptide. This was a T2232A 250 mutation present solely in the Manatee DENV4 sequence. (Fig. 4c) . 342 The 1981 Senegalese strain, the closest-clustering strain to the Manatee strain isolated 343 outside the Americas (Fig. 3a-b) , shares none of these mutations with Manatee DENV4.

Although the DENV4 3' UTR lacks one of the two flaviviral nuclease-256 resistant RNAs (fNRs) in Domain I as compared to other DENV 3' UTRs (3' UTRs of other 257 DENV serotypes [1-3]), DENV4 has the same conserved secondary structures in its domain II 258 and III: two dumbbells (DB1 and DB2), and a 3\u2032 end stem-loop (3\u2032 SL) (Fig. S4). The 3'-UTR, 259 through structural conformations, can affect viral replication in hosts [41]. We noted several in the DENV4 IIb lineage prior its arrival to Florida (Node B in Fig. 3b 261 and Fig. S4b). Most of these mapped to either the highly variable region (HVR) or the adenine-262 rich segments that space functional RNA elements in DENV 3' UTRs [42]. The U10318C 263 substitution in fNR2 (fNR1 present only in other DENV serotypes) and the G10588A 264 substitution on the 3' SL mapped to base-pairing positions. However, these mutations have 265 occurred in both directions in other lineages, suggesting they don't imply fitness costs. 266 Conversely, Floridian DENV4 underwent a rare transversion (A10478U) in a conserved 267 position in DB2. This substitution favours formation of a new base-pair in DB2 structure. 268 Additionally, an insertion (10467A) occurred in the adenine-rich segment upstream of DB2; this 269 insertion is common for all lineages.",

The 278 abundance of Palmetto Anphevirus alongside the observed Palmetto 2016-2017 DENV4 279 reduction is consistent with this and suggests that these viruses and their respective 280 abundance or relative proportions within a mosquito impact DENV4 prevalence in the vector 281 population. The role of natural infections by insect-specific flaviruses on the proliferation of 282 pathogenic arboviruses carried by different mosquito vector species is equivocal. A mosquito-we detected known as cell fusing agent virus (CFAV) is of particular interest. 284 Co-infection studies in vitro with DENV2 and CFAV result in enhanced proliferation in both 285 [44]. Following this notion, the presence of CFAV in the same mosquito populations as DENV4 286 may improve viral dissemination and maintenance in mosquitoes. The observed correlation 287 between persistence of DENV4 infection into 2017 in Anna Maria and Cortez mosquitoes with 288 CFAV abundance in 2016 (Fig. 1b) appears to operate in parallel to the research conducted 289 by Zhang et al. showing the enhanced replication of the two viruses [44]. An important caveat 290 is that Zhang et al.'s research was conducted in vitro. Conversely, Baidaliuk, et al. 291 demonstrated in vivo amplification-restrictive interaction between CFAV and DENV1 [7]. How 292 DENV4 genotype X mosquito genotype X CFAV genotype interactions ultimately influence the 293 vector competence of Floridian Ae. aegypti mosquitoes remains to be determined. The 294 observed metavirome patterns sets the stage for follow-up studies to characterize the precise 295 nature of ISV-DENV-mosquito interactions viz. vector competence. 296 297 The absence of an index human DENV4 case does not preclude the possibility that DENV4 298 was transmitted locally. Up to 88% of primary DENV infections are asymptomatic, with DENV4 299 being widely understood to cause primarily subclinical infections [45, 46]. Importantly, clinically 300 inapparent infections could contribute to 84% of DENV transmission events through 301 mosquitoes [45], so the threat of local transmission cannot be ruled out. However, it is 302 noteworthy that DENV4 was detected in adult female mosquitoes reared from wild-captured 303 eggs, implicating transovarial transmission (TOT) in local Ae. aegypti as has been shown for 304 DENV1 in Key West, Florida [47]. However, since the DENV4 signal measured in 2017 was 305 lower than in 2016, with two sites losing DENV4 prevalence, TOT alone may have been and the fact that TOT is an inefficient process. Tertiary mechanisms, beyond 310 ISV composition profile and TOT, could include inapparent human-mosquito infection cycles 311 during the summer transmission (mosquito) season, which may have also contributed to 312 DENV4 persistence in Manatee County aegypti. The exact mechanisms of maintenance in 313 mosquitoes and proof of local transmission are difficult to elucidate at this juncture, considering 314 all mosquito samples were processed for RNASeq and RT-PCR (i.e., no live virus can be 315 isolated). Importantly, a comprehensive serosurvey with subsequent confirmation by gold-316 standard neutralization assay of the population from the four sample collection sites was not 317 possible within the estimated mean half-life of detectable anti-DENV4 virion IgM or IgG. This 318 limitation was unavoidable since (i) the complete viral genome assembly and orthogonal 319 confirmation occurred more than two years following the initial mosquito collections, and (ii) 320 there are significant confounders and logistical obstacles working with transient worker and 321 migrant communities in the sampled area (well outside of the current scope of the study).",

As expected, our analysis 334 suggests a Caribbean origin for the Manatee isolate due to movements of DENV4 into Florida 335 from Haiti, and preceding this, into Haiti from Puerto Rico. These results concur with previous 336 findings depicting the Caribbean as a hotspot for arboviral spread in the Americas [48-50]. 337 Diversifying selective pressure in the NS2A gene and the 2K peptide (Fig. 4a-b) experienced 338 by American/Caribbean DENV4 may have contributed to the fixation of mutations driving the 339 adaptation of DENV4 to environmental/vector conditions in these areas.

Since the \u039415 deletion maps to the HVR, it 350 does not alter the required secondary structures for sfRNA production. However, the HVR is 351 an adenylate-rich unfolded spacer with poor sequence conservation-where no reliable 352 secondary structure can be predicted, as our previous analyses suggested [42]. It has been 353 speculated that these spacers favor the correct folding of adjacent functional structured RNA implications of our findings are profound; especially considering that arboviral 359 surveillance of mosquito populations during the extended Florida mosquito season (April-360 October) is limited.

These data highlight the importance of knowing when 363 and where arboviruses are introduced and point to the potential benefit of surveilling local 364 mosquito populations for arbovirus infections prior to an outbreak. Given the increasing 365 number of travel-related arbovirus introductions into Florida alone and the risk of local 366 establishment in the state, we expect that while our report is seminal, it is likely the tip of the 367 iceberg.
