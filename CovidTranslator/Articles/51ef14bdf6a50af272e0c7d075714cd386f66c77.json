Objective: We sought to determine the presentation and burden of disease caused by HRVCs among young hospitalized children. Methods: We conducted prospective population-based surveillance in 2 US counties among children less than 5 years of age hospitalized with acute respiratory illness or fever from October 2001 through September 2003. Nasal/throat swabs were obtained and tested for HRVs, as determined by means of RT-PCR and then characterized by means of partial sequencing. Results: Of 1052 children enrolled and tested during the 2-year period, 167 (16%) had HRVs detected. Of 147 samples successfully sequenced, 64 were group A HRVs, 6 were group B HRVs, and 77 were HRVCs. Children with HRVCs were significantly more likely than those with group A HRVs to have underlying high-risk conditions, such as asthma (42% vs 23%, P 5 .023) and to have had a discharge diagnosis of asthma (55% vs 36%, P 5 .022). Conclusions: Overall, HRVCs were detected in 7% of children hospitalized for fever or respiratory conditions and constituted almost half of all rhinovirus-associated hospitalizations, suggesting that this novel group causes a substantial burden of pediatric disease.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), members of the family Picornaviridae, were first identified in culture in 1956, and currently, more than 100 serotypes have been identified. [11] [12] [13] [14] Although once thought to cause only the common cold, we and others have shown the association of HRVs with lower respiratory tract infections and asthma exacerbations in adults and children. 5, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Using sensitive molecular methods that markedly enhanced the detection of HRVs, [4] [5] [6] [7] 26, 27 we previously reported that 26% of hospitalizations for acute respiratory illness among children aged less than 5 years were associated with HRVs during 1 year of population-based surveillance. 5 However, the HRVs detected in that study were not sequenced to identify specific HRV serotypes.",

The final tree was visualized and edited with MEGA version 4. 43 Fisher exact tests and x 2 tests were used as appropriate for contingency table analyses of symptoms and signs associated with different groups of HRVs. Prospectively collected demographic and clinical data were compared in children with and without HRVs and among those in different HRV groups. Age was categorized into 3 groups, as assessed in prior New Vaccine Surveillance Network studies (0-5, 6-23, and 24-59 months), with x 2 trend tests performed to evaluate the association between age groups, HRV status, and HRV groups. Age distribution by site was assessed by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Three multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to evaluate predictors of the disease outcome with HRVCs versus HRVAs. The main risk factor of interest, age in months, was treated as a continuous variable. One model adjusted for study year and site, and the other 2 models adjusted for coinfection with any of 4 other viruses (respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], human metapneumovirus [hMPV], influenza [A or B], or parainfluenza virus [PIV] 1-3). Additional multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between coinfections and potential predictors including age, HRVA/HRVC, study year, and site. CIs were calculated for proportions assuming binomial distribution. All analyses were performed with R version 2.6.2 software.",

The HRVC genotypes had a mean nucleotide identity of 72.4% (minimum of 63.9 and maximum of 90.7%). Thus greater diversity was noted among HRVC viruses than among HRVA viruses. Multiple types cocirculated, and HRVC genotypes were detected nearly continuously during the study period (see Table E1 ). When nucleotide identity was compared between our HRVC strains and those reported in the literature, 30-34 5 of our genotypes were greater than 95% identical with the previously identified strains HRVQPM, HRVNY, or HRVX and likely represent the same viruses. Two other HRVCs identified in our study were 86% and 89.7% identical to published HRVC strains. [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] The VP4/VP2 sequences of the 77 HRVC strains did not cluster into either HRVA or HRVB groups (Fig 2) but instead clustered into 30 unique genotypes that were clearly distinct from HRVAs and HRVBs, showing a high degree of diversity within the group. Analyses of the data using maximum-likelihood method (DNAML) or neighbor joining (DNADIST and NEIGHBOR) yielded similar results (data not shown). Interestingly, we also detected a few viruses that clustered within the HRVA group but were less than 90% identical to previously identified HRVA serotypes and likely represent novel HRVA strains. The few HRVB viruses that were detected were all 90% or more identical with previously known strains.",

[30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] Our study is the first comprehensive population-based assessment of this novel group of HRVs with demographic and clinical information collected in the context of a large, prospective, multiyear study. [4] [5] [6] [7] Strikingly, we found that viruses from this new group comprised nearly half of the HRVs detected, with a substantial burden of HRV-related illness attributable to HRVCs. Furthermore, several clinically significant differences were observed in patients with HRVCs compared with patients with HRVAs. Of note, children with HRVCs were significantly older and were twice as likely as children with HRVAs to have underlying high-risk conditions, including asthma (unadjusted odds ratio, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.05-5.23). Children with HRVCs also were twice as likely to have a discharge diagnosis of asthma compared with those with HRVAs (unadjusted odds ratio, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.06-4.62). These data suggest that viruses in the HRVC group are more likely to be associated with asthma.",

In that study 59-NCR sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis, and some of the novel viruses detected were classified as HRVA2s (including the QPM strains), whereas others were classified as HRVCs. Different viral sequences obtained in these studies make direct comparisons problematic, with different phylogenetic methods and use of different outgroup species (or no outgroup) influencing the results of such analyses.

One reason appears to be the difficulty in culturing HRVCs. Similar to other groups, we have been unable to cultivate these viruses despite numerous attempts using classical and nonclassical approaches (data not shown). 33, 35 Although HRVCs might have been detected by means of RT-PCR in our earlier study, 5 we did not sequence those samples. We extensively searched HRV sequences published in GenBank before 2006 and were unable to identify any that belonged to the HRVC group (data not shown). However, Lamson et al 31 reported detecting a genetically similar virus in a specimen taken in New York in 2004, and recent data from our laboratory show that similar viruses have been circulating since at least 2002. We speculate that the increased overall detection of HRVs reported in recent studies might be due primarily to molecular detection of previously unknown HRVCs rather than improved detection of known HRVA and HRVB strains. It seems likely that HRVCs have been circulating for some time rather than being newly emergent, but additional studies in our population and others are needed to definitively address this question.",

However, we performed highly sensitive molecular testing for influenza, RSV, hMPV, PIV 1-3, and human coronavirus, including OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1 (data not shown), with no virus detected in 84.4% of the HRV-positive children, strongly suggesting that HRV was the causative pathogen. Other studies support our findings. 54, 55 A third limitation of our study was that we evaluated only 2 years and 2 geographic sites. By using highly sensitive RT-PCR methods, HRVs were detected less frequently in the 2 surveillance years contained in this report (15% HRVs) when compared with our previously published work (26% HRVs). 5 Whether this represents seasonal variation or sample degradation after multiple freeze-thaw periods in samples tested in the 2 surveillance years contained in this report cannot be determined.",

Children with HRVCs had a higher rate of discharge diagnosis of asthma (55% vs 36%, P 5 .022), suggesting that HRVCs might play an important role in asthma exacerbation. Further studies are required to confirm these interesting observations. ",
