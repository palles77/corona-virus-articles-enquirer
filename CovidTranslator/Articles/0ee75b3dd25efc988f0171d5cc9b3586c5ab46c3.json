            "text": "This paper deals with an advanced analytical epidemic diffusion model which is capable to predict the status of epidemic impacts. This newly propose model well describes an epidemic growth and it could be widely applied into various topics including pathology, epidemiology, business and data sciences. The Advanced Analytical Epidemic Diffusion Model (AAEDM) is a dynamic diffusion prediction model which is theoretically intuitive and its tractable closed formula could be easily adapted into versatile Bigdata driven analytics including the machine learning system. This dynamic model is still an analytical model but the periods of prediction are segmented for adapting the values from the dataset when the data is available. The epidemiologically vital parameters which effect on the AAEDM are also introduced in this paper. The evaluation of this theoretical model based on the Covid-19 data in Korea has been accomplished with relative fair future prediction accuracies. Although this analytical model has been designed from a basic exponential growth model, the performance of the AAEDM is competitive with other Bigdata based simulation models. Since the AAEDM is relatively simple and handy, anyone can use this model into analyzing outbreak situations in his daily life.",

Covid-19) was deeply confirmed as a pandemic [1] which is the 3rd announcement of the pandemic by WHO since 1948 [2] . A pandemic is a disease that is spreading in multiple countries around the world at the same time [1] . The same news has been announced in several Korean newspapers and TVs [2] . On the next day, Korea had reached more than 8,000 persons are infected by the Corona virus [3] . It has been panicking in Korea and still Koreans have panicked. Politicians have started to appeal their opinions about the Covid-19 pandemic for the election on this year. News medias also have been involved to appeal their political opinions even based on scientifically fake information. Many professionals in the field of Epidemiology keep talking about the Covid-19 pandemic issues and strongly insisted their opinions to appeal their existence. Many people who do not have related knowledge could only trust what epidemiologists have said [4] [5] . Although professionals have provided historical (scientific) facts which they might learn from the textbook or statistical data, there are a lot of conflictions even within their documented scientific facts. Many data scientists are working for delivering the valuable insights from the Covid-19 data [3, [6] [7] but most of them are spending their efforts for gathering and visualizing data rather than doing theoretical studies to build up a model which could describe the Covid-19 pandemic situations. Basically, the area of Epidemiology is too complicated to provide solid solution based historical facts without having theoretical thinking at the beginning.",

An exponential growth model insanely fits well in diffusion (or growth) problems including virus generating systems if the proper parameters are pre-defined at the beginning. But the main problem is that these parameters keeps changing in real-world problems like Covid-19 epidemic cases. The AAEDM (Advanced Analytical Epidemic Diffusion Model) is a dynamic diffusion prediction model which is still a theoretical model but the periods of prediction are segmented for adapting the values from the dataset when the data is available. Additionally, two critical parameters are suggested to build this new prediction model. These two parameters have been opted by most of data scientists and epidemiologists. These factors become vital parameters which could impact on the future prediction of a epidemic and give the clear cut to understand the current pandemic situation well.",
