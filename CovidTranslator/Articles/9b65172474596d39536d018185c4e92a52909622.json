IBV induces an acute, highly contagious infectious disease of chicken. IBV is globally distributed and responsible for huge economic losses in the poultry industry. IBV was first reported in North Dakota, USA, as a novel respiratory disease affecting chickens (Schalk and Hawn, 1931) . IBV infects initially the respiratory tract; for some IBV strains further virus spread may involve kidneys and oviduct causing reduction of growth rate, decreased performance and reduction of egg quality and quantity (Cavanagh, 2003) . Also, some strains showing a shift of tissue tropism may cause proventriculitis (Yu et al., 2001) .The infection is spread by aerosols, direct contact and indirectly through contaminated fomites (Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2000) .",

            "text": "IBV harbors an unsegmented RNA genome of positive polarity which is approximately 27.6 kb in size and codes for four structural proteins: the spike (S) glycoprotein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, the nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein, and the envelope (E) protein (Spaan et al., 1988) . The N protein is a major structural protein, and highly conserved among different IBV serotypes The spike (S) glycoprotein, an integral membrane protein, is another major structural protein; it is cleaved post translationally into the S1 (N terminal part) and S2 fragments. Mature S proteins trimerize and form the globular head (S1) and the stalk domain (S2) of the viral peplomer spikes (Belouzard et al., 2012; Cavanagh, 2007) . The S1 protein carries the receptor binding site and thus plays an important role in both tissue tropism and induction of protective immunity (Belouzard et al., 2012; Wickramasinghe et al., 2011) . Numerous distinct serotypes have been described which differ by 20-25% and sometimes up to 50% in the S1 protein sequence (Adzhar et al., 1997) . In particular, three hypervariable regions (HVRs; amino acid residues 38-67, 91-141 and 274-387) along the S1 gene are affected that elicit neutralizing and serotype-specific antibodies Koch et al., 1990; Moore et al., 1997) . Variation in these epitopes has been implicated in escape from vaccine-induced immunity (Belouzard et al., 2012) .Genotypes of IBV are classified based on the genetic variation of the S gene encoding the spike protein, in particular its S1 fragment (Belouzard et al., 2012; Cavanagh, 2007; Valastro et al., 2016) .",

Thus, primers were degenerated at key positions as shown in Fig. S1 to allow broader, yet specific, target hybridization. The specificity of RT-qPCR primer set was evaluated by examining different avian respiratory viruses circulating in poultry in Egypt including AIV H5N1, H9N2 and NDV as well as different coronaviruses including a panel of IBV reference strains as listed in the materials section. This comprises all IBV genotypes reported to be circulating in Egypt. No amplification was detected for H5N1-, H9N2-and NDV-specific RNA ( Table 2) . As predicted by Shannon entropy plots, a distinctly specific amplification of IBV RNA but not of other coronaviruses, with the exception of turkey coronavirus, was observed with the N-specific RT-qPCR primer set. Genomic RNA from IBV isolate (M41) was used as template for initial validation experiments. Analytical specificity and sensitivity of the newly developed RT-qPCR compared favorably with the 5 UTR \u2212specific RT-qPCR of Callison et al. (2006) (Table 2 ) which also does not differentiate between IBV and turkey coronaviruses. Run-off RNA transcripts of the IBV N gene fragment were used to evaluate analytical sensitivity of the IBV-N-specific RT-qPCR. Investigations using copy-based RNA run-off transcripts showed a detection limit of that PCR close to 10 copies per assay. The Cq values corresponding to 10 RNA copies were 37 \u00b1 0.5. The standard curves as shown in Fig. 1 depict a dynamic linear range across at least 6 log units of RNA copies. Linear regression analysis revealed excellent reproducibility characteristics (Fig. 1) . Based on these results the N-specific RT-qPCR was deemed fit as a screening tool for IBV infections in clinical poultry samples from Egypt.",

The specificity of the two HVR primer sets was further confirmed using reference strains compromising different genotypes circulating in Egypt as mentioned in the Material section. An amplificate of 1010 bp was also generated using the forward primer for HVR1-2 and the reverse primer of HVR3; this amplificate covers all three HVRs of the S1 gene (Fig. S2) . A trade-off had to be observed between a shorter PCR product which is less vulnerable to be affected by target RNA degradation in clinical samples and a longer one yielding more sequence information (Moss and Thein, 1998) . Therefore, a decision was taken to generally amplify the three S1 HVRs in two separate PCRs when examining clinical samples. Generally, a sequenceable product was generated with these S1 RT-PCRs from clinical samples if the Cq value obtained by use of the N-specific screening RT-qPCR was lower than 32 (equivalent to approximately 100 RNA target copies). Thus, this method gives maximum flexibility that can be adjusted according to the sample quality (virus isolate versus clinical sample).",

Molecular pathotyping for the H5 viruses revealed presence of highly pathogenic strains of clade 2.2.1 as genetically characterized in a previous study (see also (Naguib et al., 2015) ). For ND, three velogenic viruses all clustering with genotype VII were detected while the remaining eight were lentogenic vaccine strains.

The sequences obtained were added to an alignment that had also been used for the in silico analysis of the HVR primers: The sequences derived from three samples (AR2206, AR2185 and AR2211) revealed a high similarity of about 96.1-97.7% at the amino acid (AA) level with Egyptian IBV variant II (e.g., strain EG/1297B/2012, Genbank accession number: KC533683.1) but only 72.1-72.9% to Egyptian variant I (Eg/Beni-Suef/01, GenBank accession number: AF395531) within their HVRs 1 and 2. The remaining four viruses (AR2189, AR2198, AR2211 and AR2212) showed 83.3-89.7% AA identity in those regions with Egyptian variant II viruses (Table 4a ).

            "text": "Therefore, rapid molecular diagnostic tools covering the broad spectrum of IBV circulating in Egypt are required as well as subsequent genotype identification. The IBV N-specific RT-qPCR and HVR1-3-specific RT-PCR assays developed and adapted in this study are shown to provide a reliable sensitive and specific approach for screening of suspect samples as well as for downstream genetic characterization of viruses. The HVR-specific PCRs allowed for genotyping directly from clinical samples omitting the need to isolate virus, provided a well preserved RNA sample quality and sufficient viral loads. Partial S1 gene analysis of the three HVRs of seven IB viruses detected and characterized in this study showed that they were closely related genetically and phylogenetically to the currently circulating Egyptian variant II. In particular, HVR3 of these viruses formed a monophyletic cluster (Fig. 2B) . Analyses of HVRs 1 and 2, however, revealed two distinct phylogenetic groups ( Fig. 2A) . Thus, there seem to exist two populations of Egyp- Table 4 Comparison of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the S1 HVR1-2 (a) and HVR3 (b) of IBV from Egyptian field samples with reference and vaccine strains of different IBV serotypes. tian variant II viruses which can be distinguished in their HVR1, 2 loci. The molecular mechanisms having caused this split remain to be elucidated. To confirm or rule out recombination full length S1 sequences will be required of a larger panel of Egyptian IB viruses. In addition, it remains to be clarified whether antigenic differences exist between the two clusters within Egyptian variant II. In this set of samples, no IBV of Egyptian variant I was detected; this seems to confirm previously published data from GenBank indicating a dominance of Egyptian variant II. Infectious bronchitis, avian influenza and Newcastle disease are the three major causes of economic losses in the poultry industry; they are able to induce disease independently or in association with each other. Avian influenza H5N1 and H9N2 subtypes continue to circulate in Egypt since 2006 and 2011, respectively, causing many outbreaks in poultry farms (Naguib et al., 2015) . Velogenic NDV circulating among chickens in Egypt resembles genotype VIId (Chicken/China/SDWF07/2011) and is associated with outbreaks in commercial poultry farms despite adherence to strict vaccination regimes (Radwan et al., 2013) . Similar co-infections of avian influenza and velogenic NDV were observed also in neighboring countries such as Jordan and Libya (Kammon et al., 2015; Roussan et al., 2008) . In addition, a recent similar single case was reported in Egypt (Hussein et al., 2014 ). An at least partial but not sterilizing, possibly vaccine-induced, specific immunity against these pathogens is likely to be at the basis of these observations. Continuing clinically disguised virus circulation in the presence of specific immunity not only fosters spread of these agents but also drives the development of viral escape mutants. It should be noted that the mortality rates described for the holdings do not correlate with the presence of IBV, HPAIV H5N1 or velogenic NDV (Table 3 , e.g., holding 34). This investigation focused on IBV, AIV and NDV and did not consider further avian viral or bacterial pathogens. It is highly likely that also various bacterial co-pathogens contribute to and complicate the overall clinical picture.",
