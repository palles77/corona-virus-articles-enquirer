Owing to the high procurement costs and sale prices of the housing products, the prosperity of the industry depends very much on the availability of finance for house building and home purchase. Except for places such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan, house-building industries in most parts of the Asia-Pacific region have a relatively short history as real estate markets in these countries have only become fully formed in the last 20 years or so, and, often, only in major cities. Compared with North America and Western Europe, house-building industries in the Asia-Pacific region have been developing very fast in the past two decades. The growth of these industries has given momentum to economic development in the region because of the eco nomic activities opened for hundreds of upstream and downstream industries.",

For example, the ratio of the total house value to gross domestic product (GDP) in China in 2003 was about 2.3. It increased sharply to 3.3 in 2009. Over the period between 2002 and 2008, the average house price in South Korea increased by almost 60%.

            "text": "The most glorious era for the house-building industry in Japan was the years immediately before the burst of the asset-price bubble in the early 1990s. At that time, the investor's confidence in Japan's economy accelerated business expansion, increased corporate earnings, and boosted personal income pushing up the house prices. However, the country entered its 'Lost Decade' after the bubble burst, and the house-building industry was severely hit. The recession of the industry continued in the 2000s. Construction investment turned sluggish, and the share of construction industry in the GDP decreased gradually from 7.4% in 2000 to 6.1% in 2007. The value of housing construction contracts dropped from 2840 billion yen in 1995 to 2641 billion yen in 2000, and further to 2441 billion yen in 2007. Similar declines were also experienced in the numbers of establishments and employees in the construction indus try. The number of employees in the industry in 2008 was 5.4 million which is 17.8% less than in 2000, and the number of establishments also fell from 607 000 in 2001 to 549 000 in 2006. As shown in Table 2 , housing con struction started in 2009 amounted to 788 410 units or 72.5 million square metres. The market has been recently dominated by private-sector projects. Although reinforced concrete (with and without steel frames) gained popularity in the mid-2000s, wooden structures still remain the most common structural form for housing construction. Given the downturn in the housing market, the con struction business is highly competitive. Yet, the Japanese construction industry is still among the most developed in the world. The industry has been renowned for its innovative construction techniques and designs (e.g., earthquake-resistant and green build ing designs), uncompromising quality control, and zealous commitment to research and development. Owing to their experience and expertise, many large Japanese construction companies have been increasingly placed in the world spotlight. They have built houses in other fast-growing regions in different parts of the world, including Europe, the Middle-east, Southeast Asia, the United States, and Greater China.",

Second, housing construction in South Korea has been shaped, in the context of repressive government financial policy, by speculative investment practices.

For example, in redevelopment projects, developers are required to provide a prescribed minimum amount of small-sized housing units.

Private developers must hold a Housing Developer's License in order to carry out housing developments with more than four dwelling units, pursuant to the 'Housing Developers (Control and Licensing) Act'. To obtain the license, developers have to fulfil certain require ments, like provide a minimum paid-up capital of SGD100 000.

The affluence of households, particularly those in cities, has swelled upon the economic expansion of the country, with improved household consumption power augment ing demand for private housing. The total floor space of commercialised housing sold rose by 3.6 times, from 130.0 million square metres in 1999 to 592.8 million square metres in 2008. The growth is estimated to be 7.6 times in terms of total revenue. In the 1980s, the Chinese construction industry was rather primitive. No building codes governed building product specification, design, and construction. Moreover, nearly all construction enterprises were directly supervised by the central ministries or municipal governments. Construction work projects were assigned by the authorities rather than being acquired through competitive bidding. That is why the construction indus try in mainland China was regarded as a single large enterprise with a centralised hierarchical organisation where factors of production and other resources were almost exclusively realised through administrative chan nels. These conditions were not favourable for the development of the industry and represented a funda mental lack of market competition.",

For example, the May 13 incident in 1969, involving sectarian riots in Kuala Lumpur, revealed the socioeconomic imbalances between different ethnic groups. To encourage homeownership among bumiputera and promote greater interaction among the various ethnic groups living in Malaysia, the Malaysian government introduced the National Economic Policy in the 1970s. Under that policy, housing developers in Malaysia have been required to set aside at least 30% of the completed housing units for the bumiputera and offer a discount of 5-15% to them. In spite of its social objectives, this policy has resulted in large inefficiencies in the local housing delivery system.

            "text": "Taiwan's housing market has been growing steadily since 2003 on account of the relaxation of the rules hindering foreign investment in the region and closer economic linkage between Taiwan and mainland China. The Taiwanese government put forward an ambitious 5-year property development plan worth NT$500 billion in 2003. The construction industry employed around 842 000 people in 2008, correspond ing to 8.1% of the total labour force in Taiwan. However, the industry's contribution to the region's economy was relatively small. It only shared 2.9% of the total GDP, or NT$363.3 billion in 2008.ThailandStarting from the mid-1970s, the economy of Thailand grew very quickly until the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997. At that time, Thailand strived to become an industrialised country and a vast amount of construction works were taken on. In spite of the economic slump between 1997 and 2003, Thailand's construction industry has grown very quickly in recent years. The value of gross output or receipts of construction establishment amounted to 394 billion baht in 2008, increasing by 22.5% from 322 billion baht in 2003. In the same year, the intermediate consumption and value added were 276 and 118 billion baht, respectively. The respective rises were 21.8% and 24.3% in comparison with the figures in 2003. As shown inTable 7, the value of residential construction also increased continuously from 2001 to 2005. In 2006, permits were issued by the authority for construction of a total of 146 229 residential buildings throughout the country, resulting in the addition of 218 767 dwelling units or an increase in floor space of 45.6 million square metres.In the 2009 Construction Industry Survey, the number of building companies in Thailand in 2008 was estimated at 29 360, constituting an increase of around 41.4% since 2003.

However, the survey results also indicate that the majority of construction establishments (83.1%) were small in scale, with not more than 10 persons. On the whole, there was a business concentration in a few large-scale listed construction companies. Apart from local projects, large Thai con struction companies have also started working on construction projects in Bangladesh and other neighbour ing countries like Laos in recent years. Compared with Asian counterparts, the Thai construction industry is still far from mature with a significant absence of professional skills and advanced technologies. In this light, there has been a call for the establishment of a national institution of construction to improve industry standards.",
