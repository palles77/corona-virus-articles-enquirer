When GVHD is prevented in Rt-1 mismatched chimeras, there is good reconstitution with donor lymphocytes, indicating that the atrophy is not caused by a failure of alloantigen recognition by donor cells (38).

While the periarteriolar region in the normal spleen contains predominantly T lymphocytes (40, 41) , we cannot necessarily extrapolate this organization to the early chimeric spleen. The marked depletion which followed shortly thereafter suggests that these immunoblasts were not immediate precursors of normal spleen T lymphocytes.

These spleens were much more atrophic, particularly in the eccentric regions, than in patients $with DiGeorge's syndrome or thymectomized rats reconstituted with syngeneic marrow, suggesting that thymic atrophy alone was not responsible. The good reconstitution ob-BESCHORNER, TUTSCHKA, AND SAN-I-OS served in allogeneic recipients when GVHD was prevented also suggests that GVHD-associated atrophy was not just a failure of alloantigen distinct lymphocytes to recognize the appropriate splenic regions.

The tongue had the earliest injury and was the most sensitive nonlymphoid tissue for monitoring GVHD. Along with the tongue, there was in some rats injury to lobular hepatocytes, intestinal crypt epithelium, conjuctivae epithelium, and exocrine pancreas. Additional tissues consistently injured later than 14 days included skin epithelium and hair follicles, esophagus, urinary bladder, and less frequently, hepatic bile ducts, the bronchial mucosa, salivary and lacrimal gland duct epithelium, and renal pelvis. One cannot exclude a role for infection, such as coronavirus, rat hepatitis virus, or mycoplasma pulmonis contributing to injury of various target tissues (48) (49) (50) . We believe, however, that these tissues are injured by the same mechanism for the following reasons. The lesions were absent in syngeneic recipients, Day 8 radiation controls, and (excluding the intestine) allogeneic recipients before Day 8. The histologic pattern was similar with lymphocytic infiltration, intersitial edema, and vacuolization and necrosis of target cells. Finally, the presence and severity of injury was proportional to the degree of inflammation and injury in the tongue.",

A second contributing factor to mucosal damage would be an associated deficiency of local intestinal immunity in the conventionally raised rat. In contrast to the syngeneic recipients and even radiation controls, there was marked plasma cell depletion by Day 5 and absence after Day 8 in the allogeneic marrow recipients. GVHD has been observed to prevent the normal development of intestinal immunity in newborn mice (58) and to deplete intestinal plasma cells in man (55). The significance of eliminating host plasma cells from the intestine is suggested by studies which observe karyolytic bodies but minimal diarrhea or BESCHORNER, TUTSCHKA, AND SANTOS mortality in germ-free chimeras (59, 60) and increased mortality with defined bacterial contamination (61) . While the infectious agents were not identified in the present model, superinfection was suggested by increased neutrophillic infiltrate and villous flattening in the later periods.",
