In its early years, global sourcing was examined mostly from ''in-house'' development and procurement perspectives; and in the last several years, research focus has shifted to ''outsourcing'' activities. Along with this shift from internal to external focus on global sourcing, many researchers and business practitioners have applied a core competency argument to justify increased levels of outsourcing activities on a global basis. Although the beneficial aspects of outsourcing are assumed in most cases, no consensus exists in reality as to the effect of outsourcing. Furthermore, the increased instability of the exchange rate environment in the last several years has also led to increased difficulties in managing globally scattered operations that were once fashionable in the 1980s-90s under the rubric of global strategy. In this article, the authors explore potential limitations and negative consequences of outsourcing strategy on a global scale. D",

            "text": "Global competition suggests a drastically shortened life cycle for most products and no longer permits companies a polycentric, country-by-country approach to international business. If companies that have developed a new product do follow a country-by-country approach to foreign market entry over time, a globally oriented competitor will likely overcome their initial competitive advantages by blanketing the world markets with similar products in a shorter period of time. Indeed, it is imperative for companies to continuously create and acquire capabilities that would help generate a sustainable competitive advantage over their rivals. Increasingly, how to source globally has become a critical strategic decision that is influenced by the capabilities needed to compete. Barney (1991, p. 102 ) has stressed that a firm possesses sustained competitive advantage when it adopts a strategy that is ''not simultaneously being implemented by any current or potential competitors and when these other firms are unable to duplicate the benefits of this strategy.'' Unfortunately, product innovation alone cannot guarantee that a firm would enjoy sustainable competitive advantage. Instead, it is of utmost importance for a firm to complement its product innovation with strong manufacturing and marketing capabilities. This is primarily because, in today's highly competitive market, legal means of protecting proprietary technology have become ineffective as new product innovations are easily reverse engineered, improved upon, and invented around by competitors without violating patents and other proprietary protections (Baumol, Nelson, & Wolff, 1994; Levin, Klevorick, Nelson, & Winter, 1987) . Production sharing facilitates technology diffusion through official and unofficial channels among competitors. Obviously, the value of owning technology has lessened drastically in recent years as the inventing company's temporary monopoly over its technology has become transitory.",

We emphasize logistical management of the interfaces of R&D, manufacturing, and marketing activities on a global basis-which we call global sourcing strategy-and also the importance of retaining the company's capability and gaining access to suppliers' capabilities to design and develop major components and finished products.

There always exist conflicts in the tug-of-war of differing objectives among R&D, manufacturing, and marketing. Excessive product modification and proliferation for the sake of satisfying the ever-changing customer needs will forsake manufacturing efficiency and have negative cost consequences, barring a perfectly flexible computeraided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) facility. CAD/CAM technology has improved tremendously in recent years, but the full benefit of flexible manufacturing is still many years away. Contrarily, excessive product standardization for the sake of lowering manufacturing costs will also be likely to result in unsatisfied or undersatisfied customers. Similarly, innovative product designs and features as desired by customers may indeed be a technological feat but might not be conducive to manufacturing. Therefore, topics such as product design for manufacturability and components/product standardization have become increasingly important strategic issues. It has become imperative for many companies to develop a sound sourcing strategy in order to exploit most efficiently R&D, manufacturing, and marketing on a global basis.",

Toyota operations that make automobiles in Southeast Asia supply each other with key components to foster increased economies of scale and standardization in those components-gasoline engines in Indonesia, steering components in Malaysia, transmissions in the Philippines, and diesel engines in Thailand. Toyota also started developing vehicles in Australia and Thailand in 2003. These new bases develop passenger cars and trucks for production and sale only in the Asia-Pacific region.

It would purchase necessary, but nonstrategic inputs from independent suppliers on an arm's-length basis to obtain a lower cost for these inputs. Examples would be belts, tires, and batteries that are not customized and do not differentiate its products from its competitors. Strategic inputs that are of high value and provide differentiation (e.g., transmission, engine parts) are sourced from suppliers based on strategic partnerships to gain access to suppliers' capabilities (Dyer, Cho, & Chu, 1998) .

The cost-saving justification for international procurement in the 1970s and 1980s was gradually supplanted by quality and reliability concerns in the 1990s. However, most of the changes have been in the way business executives think of the scope of global sourcing for their companies and exploit various opportunities available from it as a source of competitive advantage. Peter Drucker, a famed management guru and business historian, once said that sourcing and logistics would remain the darkest continent of businessthe least exploited area of business for competitive advantage. Naturally, many companies, regardless of their nationality, that have a limited scope of global sourcing are at a disadvantage over those that exploit it to the fullest extent in a globally competitive marketplace.",

Mature companies are increasingly assigning independent design and other R&D responsibilities to satellite foreign units so as to design a regional or world product.

(1998) have observed that Japanese companies make a distinction of outsourcing as to whether it is based on an arm's length or a strategic partnership basis. In the 1970s, foreign competitors gradually caught up in a productivity race with U.S. companies. This coincided with U.S. corporate strategic emphasis shifting from manufacturing to finance and marketing. This strategic shift was based chiefly on a cost -benefit analysis that manufacturing functions could, and should, be transferred to independent operators and subcontractors, depending on the cost differential between in-house and contractedout production. A company's reliance on domestic suppliers for major components is basically a domestic purchase arrangement. Furthermore, in order to lower production costs under competitive pressure, U.S. companies turned increasingly to outsourcing of components and finished products from abroad, particularly from such countries as China, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Mexico. Initially, subsidiaries were set up for production purposes (i.e., offshore subsidiary sourcing), but gradually, independent foreign suppliers took over component production for U.S. companies. This latter phenomenon is usually called offshore outsourcing (or offshore sourcing, for short).",

Japanese companies differentiate strategic suppliers (kankei kaisha) that fall into the keiretsu category from independent suppliers (dokuritsu kaisha) that do not. In utilizing both types of outsourcing, Japanese companies are able to achieve economies of scale using arm's length transactions. At the same time, they also gain access to their suppliers' capabilities for strategic inputs by using strategic partnerships. In general, ''these inputs are not subject to industry standards and may benefit from customization due to multiple interaction effects with other components in the final product'' (Dyer et al., 1998, p. 71) .

In contrast, U.S. companies tend to rely more on a sequence of new product introductions as a way to maintain their competitive advantage than on well coordinated manufacturing strategy.

Production managers' reduced influence in the organization led to a belief that manufacturing functions could be transferred easily to independent operators and subcontractors, depending on the cost differential between in-house and contracted-out production. Thus, in order to lower production costs (i.e., to improve ROE) under competitive pressure, U.S. multinational companies turned increasingly to outsourcing of components and finished products from such countries as China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Mexico, among others.

Furthermore, those multinational companies tend to promote competition among independent suppliers, ensure continuing availability of materials in the future, and exploit full benefits of changing market conditions. In addition, in an arm's length arrangement, competing firms (e.g., in the United States) tend to share a common set of suppliers (Dyer et al., 1998) , thus diluting the degree of differentiation of these major components to the buying firms. By attempting to maintain various sources of supply and a high degree of relative bargaining power, companies (e.g., in the United States) may have also restricted the size and scale of their suppliers. Furthermore, individual suppliers are forced to operate in an uncertain business environment that inherently necessitates a shorter planning horizon. The uncertainty about the potential loss of orders to competitors often forces individual suppliers to make operating decisions that will likely increase their own long-term production and materials costs.

The benefit of such internalization is likely to be great, particularly when technology is highly idiosyncratic or specific with limited alternative uses, or when it is novel in the marketplace. For such a technology, the market price mechanism is known to break down as a seller and potential buyers of the technology tend to see its value very differ-ently.

Depending on dispersed assets, specialized operations, and interdependent relationships among units of a company, Bartlett and Ghoshal (1989) , for example, described the plausible parent -subsidiary relationships for ''peacetime'' transnational solutions. However, they fell short of offering specific solutions as to how to cope with the world market not so peaceful, characterized by wild and unpredictable currency fluctuations as well as other unfortunate regional events. They developed a very useful conceptual framework to address the climate of the time of the 1980s -1990s. The climate has changed since the Asian financial crisis that wreaked havoc over what could otherwise have been a stable and growing world economy.",

Again, this view is consistent with global marketers' four alternative specifications on global product policy. Modular production generally refers to the process of assembling final products from a number of predetermined and interchangeable modules. The fundamental difference, however, is that modular production could reduce the inherent difficulty in technology transfer, in particular, that of tacit knowledge, between units of a company, thereby making decentralized/localized production feasible without losing the benefits of global integration. Another solution is attaining strategic flexibility in sourcing. Companies should design their structure to include a combination of a quasihierarchical and a pure hierarchical governance structure for different activities or operations in order to ''integrate, build, and configure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments'' (Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997, p. 516) . A combination of a quasi-hierarchical (e.g., strategic partnerships with suppliers) and a pure hierarchical governance structure allows a firm not only to exploit its own capabilities, but also to explore new capabilities or technologies through learning from its partners, sharing risks and gaining synergy.",
