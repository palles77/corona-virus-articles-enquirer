The adaptation of animal viruses to the human host, as recently exemplified by influenza viruses and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, is also a continuous threat. There is a high demand, therefore, for new antiviral lead compounds and novel therapeutic concepts. In this Review, an original therapeutic concept for suppressing enveloped viruses is presented that is based on a specific interaction of carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs) with the glycans present on viral-envelope glycoproteins. This approach may also be extended to other pathogens, including parasites, bacteria and fungi.",

This is mainly due to the inventive immunological escape mechanisms of these viruses 1,2 , as well as a lack of efficient long-term protective vaccines that can be directed against conserved epitopes of viruses that are involved in acute infections (such as the influenza virus) 3 . Instead, a broad range of chemotherapeutic agents is available for the treatment of various viral infections, in particular for HIV 4 . However, the appearance of long-term side effects and, in particular, the eventual emergence of viral resistance under drug pressure, often weakens the therapy and makes the drugs useless and even harmful in the long run. The targets of the currently available antiviral agents are essential virus-encoded enzymes, virus-specific structural proteins or cellular proteins (that is, viral receptors) 4 , but the sometimes-abundant presence of glycans on viral-envelope glycoproteins has never been seriously envisaged as a therapeutic target.",

Moreover, it has been shown that the presence of glycans on the envelope of viruses, such as HIV and HCV, is also of crucial importance for the evasion of the immunological surveillance of the host. Agents that interact with the viral-envelope glycans may, therefore, compromise the efficient entry of the virus into its susceptible target cells. Such agents do not interfere with the glycosylation enzymes from the cell, but rather act by directly binding to the intact glycans on the viral envelope. Perhaps more importantly, such carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs) may force the virus to delete at least part of its glycan shield to escape drug pressure 5 ; this might result in the initiation of an immune response against uncovered immunogenic envelope epitopes.",

In the broader perspective, apart from viruses, other pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori and some parasites may also be susceptible to this novel therapeutic approach. This Review will focus on CBAs and the molecular mechanism of their antiviral activity (FIG. 1) . The escape mechanisms of HIV in response to CBA pressure and how these escape mechanisms might involve the immune system to further combat the viral infection will also be discussed. The interference of CBAs with the dendritic cell (DC)-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3)-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN)-directed capture and transmission of HIV and other pathogens will also be highlighted, and the unique features of the CBA therapeutic concept and its potential pitfalls will be discussed.

            "text": "Glycosylation is a highly diverse co-and post-translational protein-modification reaction that can be broadly divided into two categories; O-linked and N-linked glycosylation. In O-linked glycosylation, which probably occurs in the Golgi apparatus, the carbohydrate moiety is covalently linked to the hydroxyl oxygen of serine and threonine, but it can also be bound to tyrosine, or to 5-hydroxylysine and 4-hydroxyproline 6 . O-glycosylation has various functions, such as providing ligands for selectins, resistance to proteolysis of stem regions of membrane proteins and creating specific recognition phenomena 6 . It can also help to mask immunogenic epitopes on the protein. O-linked glycosylation usually has N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) as the binding sugar but can also involve other sugars, such as fucose, glucose and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Galactose and/or sialic acid are also often found in O-glycans. The covalently N-linked glycans (FIG. 2) are added co-translationally to native polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as blocks of fourteen sugars (Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 ). These glycans are then subject to extensive modification during their transport through the ER and the Golgi complex before reaching their final destinations inside or outside the cell 7 . In the ER and the early secretory pathway, the oligosaccharide repertoire is still small. In the Golgi complex, however, the glycans acquire complex and highly diverse structures by terminal glycosylation, which results in a tremendous heterogeneity. Such diversity differs between cell types, tissues and species, and helps to further increase microheterogeneity in the presence of an identical genetic polypeptide background. This results in the creation of new functionalities and specificities 8, 9 . The N-glycans may also have an important role in proper protein folding and degradation 10 , and solubility, by avoiding the precipitation that is caused by lipophylic aminoacid stretches in the nascent polypeptide 11 . They also control proper peptidic oligomerization and the sorting of the peptides, as well as peptide transport and trafficking (by acting as universal 'tags' for specific cellular lectins and modifying enzymes) 7, 9, 12 . The presence of a glycan shield on the peptides also enables the efficient protection of the glycoproteins against degradation by proteases.",

Exposure of CBAs to the virus in cell culture has also been shown to force the virus to delete part of the protective glycan shield that is present on its envelope glycoprotein gp120. It is assumed that such glycan deletions trigger an enhanced neutralizing antibody response to the previously hidden immunogenic epitopes of gp120 and possibly also a cellular immune response.

The most well-studied CBA is undoubtedly cyanovirin-N (CV-N), an 11-kDa protein (composed of 101 amino acids consisting of two sequence repeats) originally purified from extracts of the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum 18 . The elucidation of CV-N crystal structures revealed the existence of a domain-swapped dimer, with two primary carbohydrate-binding sites and two secondary carbohydrate-binding sites on opposite ends of the dimer [19] [20] [21] . The carbohydrate-recognition sites have a binding geometry of high-mannose glycans, in particular \u03b1(1,2)-linked mannose oligomers 22, 23 . A monomeric 13-kDa protein isolated from the unicellular freshwater bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis viridis NIES-102 strain (Microcystis viridis lectin (MVL)) 24 was also shown to be composed of two tandemly repeated homologous domains, with specificity for \u03b1(1,6)and possibly \u03b1(1,3)-mannose oligomers. Its smallest target is a Man 2 GlcNAc 2 tetrasaccharide core 25 . Scytovirin (SVN), a 9.7-kDa peptide, with 95 amino acids, has most recently been isolated from the cyanobacterium Scytonema varium 26 and was shown to have a pronounced affinity for \u03b1(1,2)-\u03b1(1,6)-mannose trisaccharide units 27 . Both CV-N and SVN inhibit HIV infection in cell culture, at 50% effective concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 nM, respectively. MVL, however, is less inhibitory against HIV 28 .",

Actinohivin 30 , derived from the actinomycete Longisporum alba (a 12.5-kDa protein, with 114 amino acids), and Griffithsin (GRFT) 31 , isolated from the red alga Griffithsin spp. (a 13-kDa protein, with 121 amino acids), were also recently shown to recognize mannose-type glycans. Interestingly, the calcium-independent GRFT, a dimeric protein with four \u03b1(1,2)-mannose carbohydrate-binding domains (CBDs) separated by short linker sequences, has no homology to any other primary amino-acid sequence that has been found so far 31 . GSA showed complete suppression of HIV-1 infection in the H9 cell line at a concentration of 0.2 \u00b5M. At the same concentration, syncytia formation between H9 and HIV-1-persistently infected Jurkat cells was blocked 32 . Actinohivin inhibits both T-cell and macrophage infection by HIV-1 at 60 to 700 nM concentrations in cell culture 33 ; GRFT is exquisitely active against CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-tropic HIV-1 (X4 HIV-1) and CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5)-tropic HIV-1 (R5 HIV-1) isolates, with EC 50 s ranging from 0.04 to 0.63 nM 31 .",

The antiviral activity of CVL against HIV is in the range of 0.004-0.06 \u00b5M 42 ; the anti-HIV activity of Mermaid has not yet been reported. Mammalians also have several types of CBA. MBL is a calcium-dependent multimeric CBA that is found in serum 13, 44 and contains subunits of approximately 31 kDa. Besides mannose, it also binds GlcNAc and fucose. MBL is part of the innate immune system and binds pathogens as the initiating step of the lectin pathway in order to opsonize the pathogen 44, 45 . DC-SIGN is another example of a vertebrate mannose-specific lectin that is predominantly present on immature DCs 46 . It functions in DC recognition and the uptake of pathogens (such as HIV), leading to antigen presentation to T cells 47 . Various other CBAs, apart from MBL or DC-SIGN, are also part of the innate and/or adaptive immune system.

Interestingly, CBAs that are assumed to have a well-defined glycan specificity may still differ considerably in antiviral potency, although this phenomenon is not well understood. It is clear, however, that subtle differences in their three-dimensional conformation, as well as the proper steric availability of the glycans that efficiently interact with CBAs and the presence, or lack, of well-defined glycan conformations on the viral envelope, have an important role in the eventual antiviral efficacy of CBAs.",

It has also been demonstrated that CBAs have a pronounced inhibitory effect on virus capture by cells that express DC-SIGN and on the subsequent transmission of the virus to uninfected T cells 73 . DC-SIGN is a natural C-type lectin that has a pivotal role in innate immune defence 46 (BOX1; FIG. 1) . To eliminate the pathogen from the infected host, DC-SIGN captures pathogens such as HIV through its envelope glycans, and subsequently presents the pathogen or pathogen fragments to appropriate T cells 74 . These observations are potentially important from a microbicide viewpoint, as microbicides aim to prevent virus infection that may occur after the exposure of an individual to the virus through sexual intercourse. Indeed, DC-SIGNmediated virus capture and transmission to T cells is believed to be among the first events that occur during the viral infection process through sexual contact 75, 76 (BOX 1). However, its exact role in HIV transmission remains controversial -Boggiano et al. 77 and Wang et al. 78 Agents that efficiently prevent the first steps of virus propagation may qualify as promising microbicidal agents and have the potential to prevent persistent establishment of infection. The observation that CBAs might compete directly with DC-SIGN to capture HIV deserves further investigation in terms of their impact on the efficiency of virus capture and the subsequent transmission of the virus to T cells. Interestingly, it was recently reported that langerin, a C-type lectin that is present on epithelial Langerhans cells (LCs), prevents HIV-1 transmission by LCs by internalization of captured HIV particles and subsequent intracellular degradation 79 . Although such a mechanism may be efficient for a first-line inactivation of HIV, CBA-exposed HIV strains may decrease the efficiency of LCs to eliminate HIV, but at the same time may compromise the ability of the virus to be efficiently transmitted by DCs.",

In addition, virus particles from which the glycans had been stripped became markedly less infectious. Interestingly, combining CBAs with the mannosidase inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ) led to the expression of synergistic antiviral activity 82 . Exposure of glycandeleted mutant HIV-1 strains to DMJ results in an enhanced suppression of mutant virus-induced cytopathicity in cell culture 82 .

However, one of the next steps during the entry process (which is binding to the co-receptor(s) and/or the subsequent exposure of gp41 to the target-cell membrane) becomes blocked in the presence of the CBA. The exact molecular mechanism of the blockade of virus entry and/or fusion has not yet been determined. However, it can be assumed that the attachment of the CBA to the glycans of gp120 hinders or prevents the conformational changes and flexibility of gp120 that are required to properly interact with the cell-membrane receptor, before or during the fusion process. In a number of cases, it has even been observed that the binding of virus particles to their target cells can be enhanced in the presence of some CBAs 60 . This phenomenon may indicate that some sort of crosslinking between the virus particles and the cell-membrane glycoproteins occurs. Alternatively, CBA-induced conformational changes in gp120 may allow a more optimal interaction of the CD4-binding site on gp120 with the cellular receptor. It should be mentioned that the CD4-binding site on gp120 does not contain N-glycans, and deletion of N-glycans in the vicinity of the CD4-binding site on gp120 (of simian immunodeficiency virus strain SIVmac239) has been reported to increase the binding efficiency of the mutant gp120 with CD4; it was concluded that",

Antiviral drug resistance is usually due to aminoacid mutations and/or deletions in the viral target with which the particular drug directly or indirectly interacts. In many cases, one amino-acid change is sufficient to provoke a marked degree of drug resistance, although sometimes several mutations are required before pronounced phenotypic resistance becomes evident. Viral fitness or infectivity is often compromised in the presence of such resistance mutations. However, compensatory mutations may also occur. These aminoacid mutations do not contribute to drug resistance, but rather are meant to restore the fitness of the virus. For HIV, exposure to CBAs invariably results in the appearance and accumulation of amino-acid mutations, predominantly in the putative N-glycosylation motifs of gp120 (REFS 41, 54, 60, 69, (84) (85) (86) . Either an asparagine, or a serine or threonine, are mutated, leading to the annihilation of the glycosylation site. No glycan deletions were observed, however, in the HIV-1 glycoprotein gp41 of such mutant virus strains. The HIV-1 gp120 consists of approximately 30-40% high-mannose-type glycans (approximately 10 out of 24 glycans in HIV-1/III B ) 87, 88 (FIG. 5a) , which are the preferential sites for glycan deletions that occur under CBA pressure (FIG. 5b) .

However, when the first glycosylation-site deletions occur under CBA pressure in HIV-infected cell cultures, phenotypic resistance is rarely observed. For example, mutant virus strains have been isolated that contain at least three or more glycosylation-site mutations in gp120 without the appearance of visible phenotypic resistance to the GlcNAc-specific UDA 41, 85 . Therefore, there seems to be a threshold for the number of glycan deletions below which no significant phenotypic CBA resistance is evident.",

            "text": "There is much evidence indicating that the glycan shield of HIV-1 prevents the immune system from efficiently neutralizing the virus. HIV-1 strains lacking the highly conserved N-linked glycan at position 306 (designated as 301 in Fig. 5 owing to a different numbering of the amino acids) within the V3 loop of gp120 are highly sensitive to neutralization. Bolmstedt and co-workers 89 also showed that glycosylation at this amino-acid position shields HIV-1 from neutralizing antibodies. Kang and colleagues 90 recently reported that HIV env-encoded proteins, with deleted glycans in the gp120 domains surrounding the CD4 binding site, or in the gp120 variable loop, expose immunogenic epitopes at much higher levels than wild-type virus does, which may provide a tool for novel vaccine immunogens. Specific N-linked glycosylation modifications in the envelope V1 domain of SIV or in a SIV-HIV hybrid variant have also been shown to evolve in the host and alter recognition by neutralizing antibodies 91, 92 . Studies with SIVmac239, which is highly resistant to neutralization by polyclonal antisera or monoclonal antibodies, have shown that elimination of N-glycan attachment sites in the envelope gp120 results in a dramatically increased sensitivity to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies 93 . Importantly, removal of specific N-glycans from V1 and V2 led to an increase in sensitivity to neutralization by antibodies recognizing epitopes from both within and outside the V1-V2 sequence. Indeed, mutations in V1 not only resulted in an increased antibody recognition to epitopes in V1, but also in a redirection of antibody responses to the V3 loop, which is distant in the linear polypeptide sequence 94 . When Rhesus monkeys were infected with mutant SIV strains that were lacking in combinations of the two N-glycosylation sites in gp120, a marked increase in antibody binding to specific peptides derived from the glycan-deleted regions was observed, which resulted in an increased neutralizing activity. These results convincingly demonstrated that the presence of N-glycans limits the neutralizing antibody response to SIV, and helps shield the virus from immune recognition 95 .",

Importantly, the total number of potential N-glycosylation sites did not increase over time, and there was a remarkable degree of conservation in patterns of change in Env glycans. These findings suggest that the configuration of the glycan shield is under considerable constraints, which is in agreement with the findings of Poon et al. 97 , who showed that negative (exclusive) interactions occur more often between co-localized glycans, whereas positive (inclusive) interactions are restricted to more distant glycans. These data imply that the adaptive repertoire of alternative configurations in the HIV-1 glycan shield is limited by functional interactions between the N-glycans 97 . Therefore, it seems likely that CBA exposure to SIV or HIV strains would seriously compromise these constraints, by forcing the AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; DC-SIGN, dendritic-cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin; HCV, human hepatitis C virus; L-SIGN, liver/lymph node-SIGN ; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome.",

In this way, DC-SIGN can be considered to be a universal pathogen receptor. Indeed, the recent identification of the carbohydrate specificity of the SIGN molecules for high-mannose-and/or fucose-containing glycans has led to the identification of various pathogens that are recognized by these receptors (TABLE 1) . DC-SIGN binds and internalizes Dengue virus 99 , human cytomegalovirus 100 , HCV 101 and Ebola virus 102 to allow efficient trans infection of the target cells. It is also well documented that HCV closely interacts with both DC-SIGN and liver/lymph node (L)-SIGN, a close homologue of DC-SIGN that is expressed on specialized liver and lymph-node endothelial cells that have antigen-presenting capacity 98 . The capture of HCV by the SIGN-positive cells, through the highly glycosylated (high-mannose type) envelope glycoprotein E2, facilitates HCV transmission to proximal hepatocytes 102 . DC-SIGN and L-SIGN were also shown to enhance infection mediated by the Marburg virus glycoprotein GP and the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) through pH-dependent endocytosis, and might promote virus dissemination 103 . Although M. tuberculosis primarily infects macrophages, it also binds to DCs through the interaction of its cell-wall component ManLAM (mannosylated lipoarabinomannan) with DC-SIGN 104, 105 . The binding of ManLAM to DC-SIGN on DCs blocks DC maturation and induces the expression of immunosuppressive interleukin-10 (IL-10) 104 . As a result, M. tuberculosis enables the suppression of immune activation signals, which allows immune escape. Probiotic bacteria, such as Lactobacillus spp., also exert immune suppression through DC-SIGN by the induction of IL-10-producing regulatory T cells 106 . It has recently been shown that serotypes 3 and 14 of Streptococcus pneumoniae specifically interact with DC-SIGN through the capsular polysaccharide, but the immunological consequences are unclear 107 . H. pylori and the parasite (protozoa) Schistosoma mansoni were shown to bind to DC-SIGN through non-sialylated Lewis antigens that are expressed on lipopolysaccharides of the bacterium and the cell-wall glycolipids of the parasite, respectively 108, 109 . This results in immune regulation that is to the advantage of the pathogen 110, 111 . Leishmania mexicana has also been shown to express glycoconjugates that are recognized by DC-SIGN 108 .",

The CBA may prevent efficient capture and transmission of the pathogen and/or suppression of an efficient immune response against the pathogen. Therefore, it can be predicted that CBAs may have a more general role in abrogating successful pathogen infection and persistence.

Such a reaction by the immune system may hamper and attenuate the activity of the CBA against the viral carbohydrates (making them less antivirally active). It may also provoke hyperreactivity of the immune system, which would necessitate premature abrogation of the continued administration of the CBA. Obviously, lowmolecular-weight non-peptidic CBAs will not suffer from this potential drawback.",

However, the HIV envelope gp120 carries a higher proportion of high-mannosetype glycans than do mammalian glycoproteins 87 . The three-dimensional configuration of the glycans that are displayed on the glycoproteins of the pathogen has been shown to be important, which may help the CBA to distinguish between 'non-self ' glycans of the pathogen and 'self ' glycans of the host. High-mannose-type glycans contain terminal \u03b1(1,2)-mannose oligomers that are rare on glycans of mammalian glycoproteins. In fact, MBL and DC-SIGN can distinguish between pathogen-derived glycoproteins and cellular glycoproteins, enabling a selective elimination of the pathogen through specific interaction with its carbohydrate configuration 65, 119 . It is also important that the CBA can discriminate between the glycans present on commensal bacteria and the glycans that must be targeted on the viral-envelope glycoproteins. It will be a challenging goal, but one, I believe, which is achievable, to discover or design CBAs that show a marked degree of discriminating selectivity between pathogen glycans and the glycans of the host, including the glycans of commensal bacteria.",

However, much work still has to be done, and more synthetic low-molecular-weight compounds need to be designed or discovered to enable the efficient exploration of this novel functional class of antivirals. This is the only way to enable a careful and rational selection of CBAs that have a high specificity and selectivity for the pathogen and few, if any, side effects in the host, especially when included in long-term treatment modalities. Several synthetic CBA lead compounds are already available 61, 62 , which should trigger the synthesis of structurally related compounds, by organic and medicinal chemists, to allow extensive structure-activity relationship studies. Such investigations could indicate which CBAs are likely to be the most potent and selective candidates for further pre-clinical investigations.",

The concept of interfering with and/or abrogating these protective mechanisms should, therefore, be put into a broader context than solely antiviral therapeutic intervention. Many different microorganisms other than viruses (such as certain bacteria, fungi, yeasts and parasites) should be thoroughly investigated for their potential interactions with CBAs. However, care should be taken to ensure that those microorganisms that have a pivotal role in maintaining the homeostasis of human functions, such as non-pathogenic lactobacilli in the vaginal environment or commensal bacteria in the intestine, are not negatively affected by the CBA. Including such bacterial strains in the screening of CBAs may allow selection of the highest-possible pathogen-selective and specific CBAs in the early stages of drug development.",

They may indeed represent the first agents that combine direct chemotherapeutic activity and an indirect, active involvement of the immune system by triggering a humoral response (by producing neutralizing antibodies) and/or a cellular response (T-cell-based immunity). Although the triggering of a cellular immune response by CBAs is still to be confirmed in vivo, indirect information suggests that an immune response is to be expected after prolonged treatment of the pathogen with CBAs.",
