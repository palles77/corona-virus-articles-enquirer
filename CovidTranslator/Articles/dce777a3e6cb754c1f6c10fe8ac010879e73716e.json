            "text": "The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev protein is essential for the virus because it promotes nuclear export of alternatively processed mRNAs, and Rev is also linked to translation of viral mRNAs and genome encapsidation. Previously, the human DEAD-box helicase DDX1 was suggested to be involved in Rev functions, but this relationship is not well understood. Biochemical studies of DDX1 and its interactions with Rev and model RNA oligonucleotides were carried out to investigate the molecular basis for association of these components. A combination of gel-filtration chromatography and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that recombinant DDX1 expressed in Escherichia coli is a well-behaved folded protein. Binding assays using fluorescently labeled Rev and cell-based immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed a specific RNA-independent DDX1-Rev interaction. Additionally, DDX1 was shown to be an RNAactivated ATPase, wherein Rev-bound RNA was equally effective at stimulating ATPase activity as protein-free RNA. Gel mobility shift assays further demonstrated that DDX1 forms complexes with Rev-bound RNA. RNA silencing of DDX1 provided strong evidence that DDX1 is required for both Rev activity and HIV production from infected cells. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a clear link between DDX1 and HIV-1 Rev in cell-based assays of HIV-1 production and provide the first demonstration that recombinant DDX1 binds Rev and RNA and has RNA-dependent catalytic activity.",

            "text": "After cellular entry and genomic integration by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the HIV-1 Rev protein regulates the timing of viral gene expression that ensures completion of the viral life cycle. [1] [2] [3] Rev functions in part by promoting the nuclear export of unspliced and incompletely spliced viral mRNAs, resulting in the expression of the late-stage genes and providing genomic RNA for incorporation into virions. For this function, Rev overcomes cellular restrictions that prevent the nuclear export of incompletely processed RNA. Promotion of nuclear transport occurs through oligomeric binding of Rev on the Rev response element (RRE) (Fig. 1) , a specific binding site within the viral RNA, which targets the RNA for nuclear export by the CRM-1 export receptor pathway. Specific oligomerization of Rev on the RRE involves well-defined oligomerization domains (OD 1 and OD 2 in Fig. 1a) involving a helix-turn-helix motif. However, it is unknown how viral RNA is released from nuclear retention sites, and it is not certain what other cellular factors are required for nuclear export of viral mRNA. Furthermore, Rev has also been linked to the translation of certain HIV-mRNAs [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] and to encapsidation of the viral genome. 6, [9] [10] [11] [12] The mechanisms of Rev activity in these functions and their required cellular factors are poorly understood. Furthermore, it remains to be determined how these Rev-accessory factors function in uninfected cells and how Rev utilizes their activities during infection.",

Thus, it is not surprising that several DEAD-box proteins have been linked to Rev function in HIV-infected cells. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] However, the diverse cellular activities and biochemical properties of the DEAD-box family of proteins make it difficult to accurately predict the relationships between mechanism and function of its individual members in specific contexts. The human DEAD-box protein DDX1 has been proposed to contribute to viral replication by acting as a cofactor for Rev, and a region of Rev that might functionally interact with DDX1 has been identified. 14 However, little is known about the intermolecular interactions and enzymatic activities of DDX1.",

DEAD-box proteins commonly function as ATP-dependent RNA helicases, but the enzymatic activity of these proteins can vary widely. [24] [25] [26] The typical DEAD-box protein contains a helicase core consisting of nine conserved motifs distributed between N-terminal (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) RecA-like domains. Sequence diversity among DEAD-box proteins is found in N-and C-terminal extensions of the helicase core and in the flexible linker connecting the two RecAlike domains. DEAD-box proteins frequently bind nonspecifically to regions of double-stranded RNA and mediate conformational changes in the RNA in an ATP-dependent manner. RNA binding and conformational changes are coupled with protein conformational changes within the helicase core that are linked to a cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis. While this is a general model for activity, there is significant variability in RNA specificity and catalytic parameters of ATP hydrolysis among DEADbox family members.

As described in the previous section, DDX1 has a salt-sensitive tendency to self-associate above micromolar concentrations. Additionally, Rev has a well-known tendency for aggregation, precipitation, and fibril formation in vitro. 37 These inconvenient properties of both proteins precluded assay of the protein-protein interaction by methods such as isothermal titration calorimetry or surface plasmon resonance. Instead, a direct titration assay was developed that monitored the change in fluorescence anisotropy of an Alexa-488-labeled Rev protein in response to DDX1 binding ( Fig. 3 and Table 1 ). This assay had the distinct advantage of enabling direct detection of Rev protein at nanomolar concentrations that are below the threshold of self-association. Increasing concentrations of DDX1 were titrated into 10 nM Alexa-488-labeled Rev over a range of nanomolar to 1 \u03bcM at 25\u00b0C. The resulting isotherm was analyzed using the quadratic form of a singlesite binding model because the observed binding constant was close to the concentration of labeled Rev protein. Saturable binding was observed in this concentration range, and the dissociation constant (K d ) for the Rev-DDX1 complex was measured as 36 nM using the fluorescence anisotropy method. In contrast, labeled Rev only weakly interacted with bovine serum albumin (BSA), and the binding isotherm did not saturate at concentrations up to 1 \u03bcM BSA. Titrations conducted in the presence of either the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog Adenylyl Imidodiphosphate or ADP revealed modest effects on DDX1 binding, with dissociation constants of 53 nM and 14 nM in the presence of Adenylyl Imidodiphosphate and ADP, respectively.",

Western blotting with anti-Rev and anti-DDX1 clearly demonstrated that DDX1 and Rev were pulled down by anti-V5, whereas IgG did not adsorb either protein. Rev self-associates into higherorder oligomers through a helix-turn-helix oligomerization domain, 38, 39 and oligomerization is proposed to contribute to both nuclear import of Rev from the cytoplasm 1,40 and nuclear export of Rev-RRE complexes via the Crm1 pathway. 2 Additionally, the first helix of the Rev oligomerization domain (OD 1) overlaps with the NIS (Fig. 1) . The effects of mutations of apolar residues to polar residues within OD 1 (V16D and L18T) on the interaction between DDX1 and Rev were determined using the immunoprecipitation assay. The mutation I55N in (OD 2) ( Fig. 1 ) was chosen because it is known to affect Rev oligomerization 41, 42 while being outside of the NIS. The double mutation V16D/I55N was chosen because of its well-characterized effects on Rev oligomerization. 41, 42 The V16D and I55N mutations highly attenuate oligomerization, and the double mutant protein remains primarily monomeric at micromolar concentrations. 43 In contrast, the L18T mutation results in a protein that is less prone to oligomerize than wild-type Rev but is still capable of forming higher-order oligomers. 41 The V16D, I55N, and V16D/I55N variants of Rev did not coimmunoprecipitate a significant quantity of DDX1 in the assay. However, the L18T variant was indistinguishable from wild-type Rev.",

ATP hydrolysis was measured as a function of 351-nt RRE, stem IIB RNA, and yeast tRNA phe at 2.5 mM ATP. tRNA was used as a nonspecific control since it is highly structured and does not contain sequence homology to RRE RNA. Hydrolysis curves presented in Fig. 5 indicate that k max and K app (RNA) values for HIV-1-derived RNAs are similar within error, whereas tRNA phe is the less optimal RNA substrate for stimulating DDX1 ATPase activity than either RRE or stem IIB as k max (tRNA) is 77% of k max (RRE) and the K app (tRNA) was 10-fold larger than K app (RRE). This suggests that the virus-derived RNAs may represent specific RNA targets for DDX1. For all RNAs tested, the observed kinetic parameters are within the published range for other RNAstimulated ATPase activity of DEAD-box proteins, 5, 16, 46 although DDX1 is among the slowest reported. In terms of K app , the values for HIV-1derived RNAs with DDX1 are near the middle values reported for DEAD-box protein-RNA values, while the K app values are near the high extreme values for DDX1-tRNA phe . 5, 16, 46 The ATPase activity of DDX1 was measured in the context of the full 351-nt RRE from HIV-1; RNAs were incubated with DDX1 at three concentrations of Rev. The Rev-RRE interaction has been extensively characterized as Rev oligomers monomers that bind in a stepwise fashion to form oligomers with initial K d values in the sub-nanomolar range. 33, 34, 41, 43, 47, 48 Under the assay conditions, multiple copies of Rev are bound to the RRE at any point where Rev is in excess of the RNA. The k max and K app (RRE) values at the various Rev concentrations are presented in Table 2 . Interestingly, Rev binding to RRE had no effect on DDX1 ATPase activity. This clearly indicates that Rev does not activate DDX1 activity, and this lack of inhibition demonstrates that Rev-bound RRE remains suitable for stimulating the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of DDX1. Furthermore, this implies that DDX1 forms a functional complex with both Rev and RRE.",

The Rev-dependent reporter plasmid (pGag-RRE; Fig. 7a ) encodes the HIV-1 Gag/protease protein under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. Fused to this is a segment from the env gene that contains the RRE. 31 Because the transcript contains a 5\u2032 splice donor site but not a splice acceptor site, it accumulates in the nucleus in the absence of Rev. 31 When cells are cotransfected with pGag-RRE and a plasmid encoding Rev protein, the binding of Rev to the RRE overcomes nuclear retention and specifies export by CRM1, a receptor that exports only a minor fraction of cellular mRNAs. Rev-dependent transactivation is monitored by the level of Gag protein expression. For comparison, a control plasmid was used containing four copies of the constitutive transport element (CTE) instead of the RRE (pGag-CTE). The CTE specifies nuclear export by the NXF-1 receptor that exports most cellular mRNAs and overcomes nuclear retention of the Gag transcript that normally occurs in the absence of Rev. Thus, in cells transfected with pGag-CTE, Gag production is independent of Rev.",

This requires a clear link between DDX1, HIV-1 Rev, and discrete steps of HIV-1 replication. It also requires a validated system for further cell-based studies of DDX1 function and molecular interactions. Both siRNAs used in our experiments inhibited production of HIV in the infection assay. Additionally, these siRNAs inhibited expression of a reporter gene whose production was driven by Rev-RRE but not expression of the same reporter driven by CTE. This effectively rules out off-target effects of the two siRNAs on general features of transcription, RNA metabolism, and translation. This approach, using two independent siRNAs that efficiently target DDX1 and that lack substantial nonspecific effects on gene expression, makes a decisive case for a role of DDX1 for HIV replication in the widely used model of HeLa cells.",

In addition to HIV-1, DDX1 plays a role in the progression of several human diseases. For example, DDX1 is overexpressed in retinoblastoma and has been found co-amplified with neuronal Myc in neuroblastoma cell lines and primary tumor specimens. 30, 51 Overexpression of DDX1 has also been linked with stem cell-associated genes in human testicular germ cell tumors 19 and as a prognostic marker for recurrence of breast cancer. 52 Furthermore, DDX1 contributes to the life cycle of several viruses. It promotes the proliferation of human polyomavirus, 53, 54 and it contributes to coronavirus replication in cell culture. 55 DDX1 is also associated with the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the hepatitis C virus genome in human liver cells. 23 Understanding of DDX1 functions and molecular mechanisms may have implications for the treatment of multiple diseases.

            "text": "When purified from E. coli, recombinant DDX1 is a soluble, folded protein that forms specific complexes with HIV-1 Rev. Under the conditions of the in vitro binding assay, the protein-protein interaction between DDX1 and Rev occurs with a disassociation constant on the order of tens of nanomolar. While this is relatively tight for a protein-protein interaction, it is considerably weaker than oligomeric binding of Rev on the RRE, which occurs in the sub-nanomolar range. 41, 43, 48 The relative difference in these affinities is consistent with previous estimates from cell-based studies of the DDX1-Rev interaction. 14 These observations demonstrate that the purified RRE complexes containing both Rev and DDX1 are mediated through protein-RNA contacts and not protein-protein interactions. The lack of cooperativity between a protein-protein interaction and RNA binding by Rev and DDX1 may result from sequestering the NIS within Rev oligomers on the RRE. Sequestering of proteinprotein interaction domains within the oligomeric and RNA binding interfaces could be a general method of regulating protein cofactor binding to Rev. For instance, the interaction between nuclear import factors and Rev has been observed to occur through interactions within the nuclear localization signal inside arginine-rich domain of RBD/OD 2. 3, 56 There are several possible roles for a DDX1-Rev protein complex that forms independently of RNA. One possibility may be to prevent diffusion of Rev from the nucleus prior to binding on the RRE. At steady state, Rev displays a nuclear and nucleolar distribution in cells. 34, 57 The diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of Rev observed in DDX1 silenced cells is very similar to the distribution that has been observed for double mutants containing the V16D variant of Rev 58 and for Rev variants that have been constructed to lack the NIS sequence. 59 It is possible that the disruption of the DDX1-Rev interaction caused by the V16D mutation results in the same change in Rev localization that is observed in DDX1 silenced cells. Another possible function may be to assist in the formation of complexes containing Rev-RRE RNA and DDX1. In the crowded and compartmentalized environment of the nucleus, a preloaded Rev-RRE complex may have a kinetic advantage in forming the ternary complex. It is conceivable that Rev interaction with DDX1 could prevent other nonproductive interactions with competing cellular components or nonproductive Rev oligomers. The relatively tighter Rev-RRE interaction could assist in disrupting the Rev-DDX1 complex while still allowing for a productive Rev-RRE-DDX1 complex assembled through protein-RNA interactions. In this manner, the Rev-DDX1 complex could serve to specifically target DDX1 to unspliced and incompletely spliced HIV transcripts in the nucleus. This could promote CRM1-mediated export of the RRE-containing transcripts by several mechanisms, which could include hypothetical DDX1-facilitated release of the transcripts from nuclear retention sites. Notwithstanding our findings, it is possible that the in vitro system is missing levels of posttranslational regulation that could influence the relativity dissociation constants of the complex. All of these possibilities warrant further investigation, and the in vitro experiments using recombinant proteins and synthetic RNAs should be considered the first step in this process.",

Both V16D and I55N are highly disruptive of Rev secondary and tertiary structures. 41 It is possible that disruptions of the helical structure of the oligomerization domain in these variants contributes more to the loss of interaction with DDX1 than is due to either the loss of specific residue contacts between Rev and DDX1 or the loss of Rev oligomerization.

            "text": "DDX1 is an RNA-stimulated ATPase that binds viral RNA substrates. DDX1 self-associates to form multiple oligomeric states at 25\u00b0C and concentrations near 10 \u03bcM; however, both the Rev binding thermodynamics and ATPase activities of DDX1 are consistent with monomeric behavior at concentrations below 1 \u03bcM. Previous reports for the ATPase activities of DEAD-box proteins range from k cat values of 1-600 min \u2212 1 and K m (ATP) values from 0.06 to 2.5 mM. 26 When compared to other recombinant DEAD-box proteins, DDX1 hydrolyzes ATP relatively slowly with a moderately high apparent K m . Although well within the range of DEAD-box protein behavior, the particular enzymology of recombinant DDX1 likely contributed to previous reports where the ATPase activity was lacking. 27, 28 Previous enzyme assays were also conducted at 50 \u03bcM ATP concentrations, which would have been too low to provide measurable activity. 27 As recently outlined, 24 several molecular mechanisms may account for the particular enzymatic properties of an individual DEAD-box protein. The simplest source of variability among DEAD-box proteins is differences in the structure and dynamics of the enzyme active sites that affect ATP binding primarily through conserved residues in the NTD. Additional residues in the N-terminal Q-motif also contribute to nucleotide recognition. DDX1 is unique among DEAD-box proteins due to the inclusion of an SPRY domain between the Q-motif and the NTD. It seems reasonable that the SPRY domain could dramatically alter the relationship between the NTD and Q-motif and therefore affect ATPase activity. However, because the rates and K m values for DDX1 are within the range of other DEAD-box proteins, structural differences in the active site are likely to be similar to those of other slow DEAD-box proteins and not due to a gross alteration of the protein conformation. It remains possible that specific protein cofactors could interact with the SPRY domain and induce conformational changes in DDX1 that result in a more optimal enzyme. As the list of possible cellular partners for DDX1 grows, it will be interesting to determine if this mechanism provides a means of regulating activity.",

            "text": "The enzymatic properties of DEAD-box proteins can also be highly dependent on the specificity for a particular RNA target. The most thoroughly studied examples are members of the DbpA subfamily whose optimal ATP hydrolysis occurs only with the 23S rRNA as a substrate. 62 Because it had not been previously determined if RRE RNA was a specific substrate for DDX1, the ATPase activity was compared using two synthetic RNA constructs based on the RRE and tRNA phe as a nonspecific control at a single ATP concentration. There is a modest enhancement of k max and a more significant decrease in K app (RNA) when HIV-1-derived RNAs are compared to the less optimal tRNA phe . tRNA is a highly structured RNA with a compact tertiary structure. In contrast, stem IIB consists only of short stretches of duplex RNA, bulged base pairs, and an unpaired loop. Given the modest k max values for both RRE and stem IIB, it is likely that the enhancements seen for the HIV-1-derived RNAs reflect the difficulty in binding a highly folded tRNA as a substrate. The observed kinetics may also reflect a preference for either double-stranded or partially unpaired double-stranded substrate. Such a preference would be consistent with the recent observation of DDX1 cellular localization at the site of double-stranded DNA breaks that result from ionizing radiation. 28 A sophisticated mechanism for the regulation of DEAD-box proteins also comes from the interaction with protein cofactors. For example, the ATPase activity of the E. coli DEAD-box protein RhlB is highly stimulated by interactions with RNase E. 63 Down-regulation of DEAD-box protein activity by protein cofactors has also been observed, as in the case of the competitive inhibition of DBP5 by the nucleoporin NUP214. 64 The effects of Rev on the ATPase properties of DDX1 were an open question. Rev neither activates nor down-regulates DDX1 in the range of the tested conditions. When compared to highly active DEAD-box proteins, recombinant DDX1 has a relatively low k max and moderate K app (RNA) RRE-stimulated ATPase activity. This may reflect a cellular function that uses catalytic activity for a cycle of binding and release rather than for processive disruption of complex RNA structure. Such cellular function has been suggested for Rok1p and Rrp3p in yeast ribosome biogenesis. 24 Furthermore, eIF4AIII is a well-documented example that does not require ATP hydrolysis for its role as an accessory protein in the Exon Junction Complex. 65, 66 Alternatively, the modest k max value of DDX1 may reflect that of an enzyme requiring posttranslational modification for full activity. This would be consistent with the observation that epitope-tagged DDX1 purified from human cell culture was more active than E. coli purified DDX1. 27 In either case, the enzymatic activity of recombinant DDX1 stimulated by Revbound RRE indicates that the recombinant enzyme retains some functionality of native DDX1. It is therefore reasonable to use recombinant DDX1 as a starting point for future investigations of the specific molecular mechanisms that regulate DDX1 enzymatic activity and to discover how these mechanisms contribute to the HIV-1 lifecycle.",
