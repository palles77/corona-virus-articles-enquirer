            "text": "Purpose: This study aimed to assess the level of posttraumatic stress disorder and to examine the relationship between exposure to war stress and posttraumatic symptoms among health care providers following Israeli offensives against Gaza Strip in 2014. Methodology: A cross-sectional design was used for this study. We targeted all nurses and doctors working in three governmental hospitals in the Gaza Strip and worked with victims of the last war, more specifically, those who were working in emergency departments, intensive care units, operating rooms, surgical departments, and burn units. A demographic sheet and Impact Event Scale-Revised were used in this study. The Impact Event Scale-Revised has three sub-scales; intrusion, avoidance, and hyper-arousal. Results: The results showed that 291 (89.8%) of 324 participants had scores more than 35 (threshold cut-off point) on the Impact Event Scale-Revised. Scores ranged from zero to 80 with a mean of 52.13. Females had higher levels of stress (55.79) than males (51.63) and nurses (54.85) had more stress than physicians (47.38). The most frequent symptoms of trauma subscales was \"avoidance\" (mean = 20.04), followed by \"intrusion\" (mean = 17.83), and then \"hyper-arousal\" (mean = 14.27). Levels of trauma symptoms were not affected by place of living, hospital of work, while level of education had impacted level of trauma. Conclusion: The findings showed that health care providers suffered from severe posttraumatic symptoms after exposure to prolonged war stress. This level of trauma among health care providers warrants intervention programs to reduce stress and trauma among Gaza health care providers after the war.",

Post-traumatic stress leads to a pattern of symptoms that include a delayed response to an acute stressful and a life-threatening event or situation, such as combat exposure during war time (Lavoie, Talbot, & Mathieu, 2011) . These symptoms may appear either during or immediately after the occurrence of the event, or several days later after its occurrence. The symptoms include initially intense fear, helplessness, or horror. Later, the individual develops a response to the stressful event that is characterized by persistently re-experiencing the event, with resultant symptoms of numbness, avoidance and hyper-arousal (Risser, Hetzel-Riggin, Thomsen, & McCanne, 2006) .",

Further, post-traumatic symptoms must be present for more than 1 month and include intrusive recollections of the traumatic event (Criterion B; at least 1 symptom), avoidant symptoms (Criterion C; at least 3 symptoms), and hyperarousal symptoms (Criterion D; at least 2 symptoms) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) . A few years later, the fifth edition of the DSM (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) proposed four distinct diagnostic clusters instead of three: re-experiencing symptoms (at least 1 symptom), avoidant symptoms (at least 1 symptom), negative alterations in cognitions and mood (at least 2 symptoms), and arousal symptoms (at least 2 symptoms). According to both editions of the DSM, symptoms of PTSD must persist for more than 1 month and must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning.",

Another study revealed that 3.3% of those nurses who are still in active duty had PTSD 20 years after the war (Stretch, Vail, & Maloney, 1985) . A more recent study revealed that 10.5% of Israeli physicians and 35.7% of nurses who were working in Ramabm Hospital in Haifa during the war between Israel and Lebanon (July 12, 2006 -August 14, 2006 experienced PTSD (Ben-Ezra et al., 2008) . Nurses who were involved in Vietnam War with chronic PTSD reported abandoning their nursing career, on-going, struggles with anger, involving in relationships in which they could not receive love, and a foreboding sense in their current lives (Buechler, 2007) . Moreover; being under direct threat toward one's life, family members, and friends while treating others is known to enhance emotional distress, burnout, and other negative consequences among mental health workers (Dekel & Baum, 2009) .",

Unfortunately, Dr. Alhajjar himself was a victim of this war as he was killed during Israeli bombardment to Jabalia Camp. In our study, we assessed posttraumatic symptoms among nurses and doctors in three hospitals after 6 weeks of the 2014 Israeli offensives against Gaza Strip in 2014, while Alhajjar assessed posttraumatic symptoms among nurses in all Gaza hospitals after 1 year of the 2012 Israeli war on Gaza. Table 8 compares the results of the two studies. As noticed from Table 8 , in this study, the percentage of nurses (93.64%) who had PTSD is higher than that reported by Alhajjar (69.4%) . Moreover, participants of this study reported higher means in total IES-R scale and its three subscales. These differences can be attributed to the fact that this war left higher numbers of deaths and causalities compared to the war of 2012. The war of 2014 continued for 51 days and left 2191 deaths and 10,895 wounded (Palestinian Center for Human Rights, 2014), while the war of 2012 continued for 8 days and left 158 deaths and 1269 were injured (Caabu, 2013) .",

Ben-Ezra et al. conducted a logistic regression model and found that nurses were 5.28 times more likely to endorse high levels of PTSD symptoms. The prevalence of PTSD among participants of Ben_Ezra et al. is much less than those reported in our study. Both studies revealed that nurses were at higher risks than doctors to develop PTSD.

            "text": "Such differences can be attributed to several reasons. First, as nurses spend more time with their clients than doctors do, they have more sympathy to their patients and they will be subject to more traumatic narratives as part of their duty, which can lead to more identification with their clients (Ben-Ezra et al., 2007) . According to Regehr, Goldberg, and Hughes (2002) , such sympathy and identification are assumed to put nurses at higher risk to develop PTSD. Second, as part of their medical training, doctors are exposed to cadavers and dead bodies which help them to develop coping strategies which resolved in higher resilience during the exposure to victims during war time (Weiniger et al., 2006) . Finally, nurses have different responsibilities while taking care of the health status of their clients with less forensic responsibility and authority compared to doctors. Therefore; there is a higher possibility that doctors will perceive control over the situation in such situations which may reduce their feelings of helplessness in comparison to nurses (Luce et al., 2002) . The high prevalence of PTSD among nurses and other health care providers in this study and other studies (Alhajjar, 2014; Ben-Ezra et al., 2007 may question the common notion of resilience among hospital nurses and other health care providers (Luce et al., 2002) .",

In the three studies, these differences were found to have no statistical significance. The higher scores of PTSD among female participants could be related to the nature of women who shows more sympathy to their clients (Regehr et al., 2002) and to neurobiological factors (Fullerton et al., 2001) as females respond more effectively due to sertraline than males (Brady et al., 2000) . Moreover, these differences could be attributed to the differential response biases in symptom reporting as male participants underreport symptoms due to cultural and societal factors (Kessler, 2000a (Kessler, , 2000b or it is possible that women are at higher risk for PTSD because of exposure to childhood trauma (Orr & Pitman, 1999) .",

Such high prevalence rates will have negative consequences in the coming future on nurses and doctors, who constitute the back bone of the Palestinian health care system. Literature has connected PTSD with negative health outcomes (Wolfe, Schnurr, Brown, & Furey, 1994) and adverse psychological disorders (Gibbons, Hickling, & Watts, 2012) such as the existence of acute depression (Hickling et al., 2011; O'Donnell, Creamer, & Pattison, 2004) , anxiety, and adverse psychosocial impact (Hickling et al., 2011; Weinberg & Creed, 2000) . Similarly, Weinberg and Creed (2000) added that health workers with post traumatic distress are more vulnerable to psychiatric disorders and ongoing social stress outside of work. Furthermore, the analysis of a study conducted by Niiyama et al. (2009) revealed that only 17% of nurses recovered from traumatic stress while the other 83% had persistent traumatic stress. Moreover; studies showed that prevalence of PTSD is associated with burn out syndrome, which together has a great impact on work and non-work related activities and perceptions (Mealer et al., 2009) .",

Health policy makers should adopt special programs that offer counseling and treatment to health care providers.
