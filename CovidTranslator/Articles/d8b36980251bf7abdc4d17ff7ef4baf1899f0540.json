We used realtime PCR to test for these and 12 respiratory viruses in 2,732 nasal wash samples collected during the fi rst year after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation from 222 patients. Specimens were collected weekly until day 100; then at least every 3 months. One year after hematopoietic cell transplantation, the cumulative incidence estimate was 26% for KIPyV and 8% for WUPyV. Age <20 years predicted detection of KIPyV (hazard ratio [HR] 4.6) and WUPyV (HR 4.4), and detection of a respiratory virus in the previous 2 weeks predicted KIPyV detection (HR 3.4). Sputum production and wheezing were associated with detection of KIPyV in the past week and WUPyV in the past month. There were no associations with polyomavirus detection and acute graft versus host disease, cytomegalovirus reactivation, neutropenia, lymphopenia, hospitalization, or death.",

If KIPyV and WUPyV are respiratory pathogens, they may be more likely to cause respiratory illness in immunocompromised persons, either during primary infection or reactivation. Few, mostly retrospective, studies on the prevalence of KIPyV and WUPyV in respiratory specimens have included large numbers of immunocompromised patients (18) (19) (20) (21) . No prospective data are available that comprehensively describe the incidence, symptoms, risk factors, and outcomes associated with detection of KIPyV and WUPyV in respiratory specimens from hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. This question is particularly relevant with the increasing use of multiplex PCR panels for detection of re-spiratory viruses, especially in samples from immunocompromised patients.",

Previous studies reported detection of these viruses in plasma, serum, and peripheral blood samples from patients infected with HIV-1, healthy blood donors, and children and in urine samples from children (1, 2, 38) and immunocompetent and immunocompromised adults (18, 38) . WUPyV was detected in serum and feces of children whose nasopharyngeal aspirate samples contained high viral loads (39) . Both viruses were detected in fecal samples from HCT recipients (18, 40) , and an association was found between KIPyV and diarrhea (40) . However, we did not fi nd an association between virus and diarrhea. Another limitation is that although we report prolonged, uninterrupted KIPyV and WUPyV detection, we did not perform genetic analyses to confi rm whether these detections represent the same or different viral subtypes.",

Prolonged detection episodes and high viral copy numbers in respiratory specimens were also observed. However, we did not observe many associations with acute respiratory symptoms. We found that detection of a respiratory virus was a risk factor for KIPyV detection and that concurrent detection of the polyomaviruses and respiratory viruses was common. Although it has been suggested that KIPyV and WUPyV might be major pathogens in immunosuppressed patients, we did not fi nd a clear role for these viruses as respiratory pathogens with classic upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms. At this time, we do not recommend routine testing for these viruses in immunocompromised patients or inclusion in multiplexed respiratory virus PCR panels. Further investigations examining other specimen types, such as BAL, blood, and urine, from a larger patient cohort over a longer period of time may be necessary to elucidate the role of these viruses in highly immunocompromised patients.
