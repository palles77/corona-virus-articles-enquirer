One group was exposed to constant light (LL) from 26 days of age, and the second group was exposed to 8 h light and 16 h dark per day (LD). Both groups received an 8 mg dose of a chemical carcinogen, dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) at 52 days of age. At 13 weeks post-DMBA, there were signi\u00aecantly fewer mammary tumors in the LL group compared with the LD group. Constant light was clearly demonstrated to have a profound effect on mammary tissue development. Although virgin, the majority of the LL rats (29/50) had gross evidence of lactation at 141 days of age. None of the LD rats (0/50) showed evidence of milk production. These results suggest that constant light not only substantially accelerated mammary gland development, but pushed development of the tissue past the stage normally observed in virgin animals (to the lactation stage). q",

As common as breast cancer is in the industrialized World, risk continues to increase [2] . The historically low rates of breast cancer in Japan have been increasing rapidly in recent decades [3] . The reasons for the increases in breast cancer risk are not well understood [4] . One possible contributor may be`light pollution' during the night, and arti\u00aecial light during the day [5, 6] . In the evolutionary past the environment consisted of dark nights and bright, full spectrum days, whereas the modem environment is comprised of lighted nights in homes, and dim, spectrum-restricted`days' inside buildings where most people now work. Indeed, the`built environment' is the predominant environment in the industrialized world. This change in lighting may change our circadian physiology, in particular normal cycling of melatonin and other hormones, leading to early menarche and elevated circulating estrogen and prolactin [7] . Early menarche and elevated sex hormones are known to increase breast cancer risk [8, 9] .",

In 1964, Jo \u00c8chle reported that the development of spontaneous mammary tumors in C3H-A mice was increased by constant illumination [10] . Early experiments wherein rats were initiated with high doses (20\u00b130 mg) of dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) and exposed to extended or constant-light photoperiods yielded mixed results [11\u00b113] . Later, Shah et al. [14] and Mhatre et al. [15] exposed the animals to continuous light from before birth, through the length of the study. Using a dose of 10 mg DMBA per 100 g body wt. of the rats, they reported that constant light increased DMBA-induced mammary tumorigenesis. At 55 days of age, rats exposed to LL showed a greater concentration of terminal end buds and alveolar buds in mammary tissue than was observed in rats exposed to a 10-h light:14-h dark regimen. Constant light animals also showed greater DNA synthesis activity in the mammary tissue, and higher levels of circulating prolactin. In rats, precocious puberty resulting from light-at-night (LAN) may serve to increase or decrease sensitivity to an acute exposure to carcinogens depending on the timing of that exposure. We embarked on this research effort to examine the effects of various light exposure regimens on mammary tissue development and tumorigenesis.",

Animals were housed \u00aeve per polycarbonate cage (23 HH \u00a3 15 HH \u00a3 8 HH ) on hardwood bedding (P.J. Murphy Forest Products, Montville, NJ). Cages were changed twice weekly and water and NIH-07 open formula pelleted diet (Ziegler Brothers, Inc., Gardners, PA) were available ad libitum. Temperature was maintained between 22^28C, and relative humidity between 50^15%. The light level from 40 W Trimline\u00afuorescent bulbs averaged 178 and 175 lux (SDs: 7.4 and 7.8, respectively) between the two rooms. The irradiance of these bulbs was measured using a spectroradiometer (PhotoResearch, model 650, Chatsworth, CA).

The 8L:16D photoperiod is characterized by an extended nocturnal period and a lengthened duration of melatonin production [16, 17] . Such a scheme was chosen to enhance the light exposure differences between animals in constant light versus those in the cycling (control) photoperiod.

Normally (in 12:12 light-dark cycle and no carcinogen administration), female rats \u00aerst begin estrus at 32\u00b135 days of age. As the mammary gland develops, terminal end buds (TEB) begin to appear and subsequently evolve into alveolar buds (AB) and eventually into terminal ducts (TD); this occurs from 40\u00b160 days of age, with maximum developmental activity at ages 40\u00b146 days [19] . The alveolar buds evolve into lobules of type 1 which are more highly differentiated structures than TEBs, TDs, or ABs, but do not produce milk. If the rat remains virgin, the mammary tissue will remain in this stage. With pregnancy, or a dramatic increase in prolactin, the type 1 lobules differentiate further into type 2 then type 3, the latter of which produce milk. There is a sharp decrease in TEB concentration after age 55 days. This progression of development differs somewhat depending on anatomic region of the gland; in the anterior regions, cervical and thoracic, the transition of TEB to TDs and AB is prolonged compared to the abdominal and inguinal regions [19] .",

There is a sharp decrease in tumor yield if DMBA is given after age 55 days because proliferative activity of the mammary epithelial cells at risk has decreased. A paradigm in carcinogenesis is that mutation is required for malignant transformation. As the rate of cell division decreases, risk of malignant transformation decreases as well, all other factors being similar. The period of 50\u00b155 days in the Sprague\u00b1Dawley rat is toward the end of the high cell cycling activity of the mammary tissue under normal conditions. DMBA is most often given at this time by toxicologists because the historically optimum dose of 20 mg yielded signi\u00aecant toxicity in younger animals. With lower doses, it is feasible to dose at younger ages.",

Our results are consistent with the idea that a greater tumor yield occurred in the mammary tissue of LD animals wherein the TEB to AB transition in the mammary tissue was occurring in the normal window of DMBA sensitivity [19] . On the other hand, the window of sensitivity was missed in the LL animals, where mammary gland differentiation had developed beyond the time of susceptibility to the DMBA (at 52 days of age). The fact that 60% of the LD rats had a tumor in the abdominal and/or inguinal regions, whereas only 11% of the LL group had a tumor in the same region, and the fact that the abdominal/inguinal regions are expected to have a more limited period of TEB differentiation support this interpretation. The appearance of lobular cysts in the LL group is also in agreement with this interpretation.",

            "text": "The results of this study are inconsistent with the results reported by Shah et al. [14] , in which constant light resulted in increased tumor yield. They reported a greater concentration of TEBs at 55 days of age in rats exposed to LL and cited this as the explanation for the greater tumor yield by DMBA delivered at age 55 days. Their results must be considered in the context of the hypothesis that elevated exposure to estrogen in utero will increase lifetime risk of breast cancer [20] by increasing mammary gland mass from the begin- ning of life. Indeed, elevated in utero estrogen has been shown to lead to altered mammary gland development and precocious puberty. Hilakivi-Clarke et al. [21] tested the hypothesis that feeding pregnant rats a diet high in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) would signi\u00aecantly raise circulating 17b-estradiol levels, and would result in increased DMBA-induced mammary tumor yield in their female pup offspring during their adulthood. The results con\u00aermed their prediction wherein the rats exposed in utero to high PUFA, and higher in utero estrogen exposure, not only experienced earlier onset of puberty, but also that their mammary glands contained signi\u00aecantly higher numbers of the epithelial structures as targets for malignant transformation. It is probable that exposure of the rat dams to light in the Shah et al. studies resulted in increased estrogen (in addition to the reported increase in prolactin) and therefore not only accelerated mammary gland development in the pups, but also increased the amount of breast tissue. The Hilakivi-Clarke et al. [21] and Shah et al. [14] results taken together suggest that the constant light exposure of dams while pregnant resulted in a greater mammary tissue mass at the beginning of life. In Hilakivi-Clarke et al., rats with high PUFA in utero and high in utero estradiol exposure did not have elevated estradiol at 4 weeks of age but did have a signi\u00aecantly elevated fat pad area and epithelial density. Differences between the study reported here and the experiments of Shah et al. [14] include differing levels of administered DMBA: 10 mg/100 g body wt. (,l7 mg per rat) vs. 4.7 mg/100g body wt. (8 mg per rat) in our study. In addition, Shah used a different strain of rats: Holtzman vs. Sprague\u00b1Dawley. However, as noted above, the most important difference may be related to the timing of LL exposure. Shah et al. exposed the dams from conception and the female pups continuously from birth. Whereas, in the study reported here, constant light exposure began at 26 days of age, presumably inducing earlier TEB\u00b1AB conversion, but with no increase in levels of TAB-AB, thus taking the timing of TAB\u00b1AB conversion out of a window of sensitivity to DMBA and yielding lower tumor development activity at 52 days of age, compared with the LD rats.",

There are, however, important differences in mammary development and tumorigenesis between rat and human. Normally age is closely related to mammary gland developmental stage and structure concentrations in the rat: it is less clearly related in the human. In the rat, carcinomas arise primarily in TEBs and TDs, and more advanced structures such as lobules can give rise to cysts. In humans, most mammary tumors appear to arise in the terminal ductal lobule unit (TDLU); these structures develop early and persist into the post-menopausal years [23] . While there appears to be a`window of susceptibility' to carcinogen in the rat, there are no data showing this in humans [23] . Therefore, advanced mammary development and elevated hormones in women due to chronic light exposure at night and altered daytime lighting might increase lifetime risk of breast cancer from either spontaneous mechanisms or speci\u00aec toxic exposures.",
