            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause respiratory and enteric disease in a variety of avian and mammalian species, including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, turkeys, dogs, cats, mice, rats, rabbits, and bats (Lai et al., 2006) . On the basis of their serological cross-reactivity and genomic organization, these viruses are divided into three categories: group 1, group 2, and group 3 (Brian and Baric, 2005; Lai et al., 2006) . Recently, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has proposed three genera-Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus-to replace the group 1, group 2, and group 3 nomenclature, respectively (Woo et al., 2009) A new equine coronavirus was isolated from the feces of adult horses with pyrogenic and enteric disease. The disease outbreak was mainly observed among 2-to 4-year-old horses living in stables of a draft-horse racetrack in Japan. On comparing the isolated virus (isolate Tokachi09) with the equine coronavirus NC99 strain, no significant differences were observed in several biological properties such as hemagglutinating activity, antigenicity (in indirect immunofluorescence and neutralization tests), and one-step growth (in cell culture). The sequences of the nucleocapsid and spike genes of isolate Tokachi09 showed identical size (1341 and 4092 nucleotides, 446 and 1363 amino acids, respectively) and high similarity (98.0% and 99.0% at the nucleotides, 97.3% and 99.0% at the amino acids, respectively) to those of strain NC99. However, the isolate had a 185-nucleotide deletion from four bases after the 3 0 -terminal end of the spike gene, resulting in the absence of the open reading frame predicted to encode a 4.7-kDa nonstructural protein in strain NC99. These results suggest that the 4.7-kDa nonstructural protein is not essential for viral replication, at least in cell culture, and that the Japanese strain probably originated from a different lineage to the North American strain. This is the first equine coronavirus to be isolated from adult horses with pyrogenic and enteric disease.",

Coronavirus-like agents have been previously identified by electron microscopy in the feces of foals and adult horses having enteric disease with fever (Bass and Sharpee, 1975; Huang et al., 1983) . A coronavirus antigen detected by antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry in the feces and intestine of a foal suffering from neonatal enterocolitis have also been reported (Davis et al., 2000) ; however, isolation and characterization of the causative agent was not successfully performed. An ECoV was isolated from the feces of a diarrheic foal in 1999 (ECoV-NC99) in North Carolina, USA (Guy et al., 2000) (Zhang et al., 2007) . Antigenic and genomic characterization studies revealed that this virus is a new member of species Betacoronavirus-1. Identification of new coronaviruses in horses and foals will help in understanding the etiologic role and epidemiology of this virus in equine species worldwide.",

Some diseased horses had diarrhea, and most animals recovered in two to four days. The outbreak subsided by the end of August, and 132 of about 600 horses finally became diseased in this period. During the outbreak period, various animal health measures were implemented at the racetrack, including a race ban, movement restriction, and disinfection, resulting in economic losses for the involved parties. Feces and nasal discharge were collected and examined to determine the causative agent.",

The supernatant was inoculated onto confluent monolayers of human rectal adenocarcinoma (HRT-18G) cells in 12-well plates and incubated for 60 min at 37 8C for adsorption. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fresh medium of the same composition except 0.125 mg/ml TPCK trypsin was added. The monolayers were examined daily for a cytopathic effect (CPE) and passaged at 4-to 5-day intervals to fresh monolayers of HRT-18G cells until a distinct CPE appeared.

Differences in the HA patterns of virus strains have also been demonstrated among in BCoVs (Storz et al., 1992) . However, the reason for such differences is unknown. ECoV has been reported to have a close antigenic relationship with BCoV (Davis et al., 2000; Guy et al., 2000) . However, only one of six horses showed antibody positivity against BCoV in the neutralization test whereas all sera showed seroconversion against isolate Tokachi09 (Table 2) . Furthermore, when we performed the neutralization test using cattle sera seropositive against BCoV, all sera showed seropositivity against isolate Tokachi09 (data not shown). This inconsistency was also seen in the cross-neutralization test ( Table 2 ). The neutralization titers of anti-ECoV serum to BCoV were significantly low when compared with those of anti-BCoV serum to ECoV. Although the reason for this difference is unknown, the result suggests that BCoV should not be used as an antigen in neutralization tests for diagnosing equine cases.",

There are ORFs predicted to encode nonstructural proteins between the S and the E genes in Betacoronavirus-1. In this region, BCoV has p4.9-, p4.8-, and p12.7-coding genes, although HCoV-OC43 and PHEV have a deletion leading to the absence of p4.9-(in PHEV, it might be truncated) and p4.8-coding genes (Mounir et al., 1993; Vieler et al., 1995) . The functions of these nonstructural proteins between the S and the E genes in coronaviruses are unknown. However, it can be concluded that the two ORFs coding p4.9 and p4.8 are not essential for the replication of ECoVs as well as in HCoV-OC43 and PHEV in cell culture. Interestingly, an antisense mutation resulting in the truncation of p4.9 has been identified only in respiratory bovine coronaviruses (Gelinas et al., 2001) . From this findings and HCoV-OC43 and PHEV, this protein could be involved in preferential respiratory tropism (Gelinas et al., 2001; Sasseville et al., 2002) . Indeed, the main clinical symptom of the affected Japanese horses was pyrexia, whereas the horse infected with NC99 had diarrhea and pyrexia (Guy et al., 2000) . These symptoms might be related to the different pathogenic properties of NC99 and isolate Tokachi09. Evidence shows that nonstructural proteins in coronaviruses may play a significant role in vivo rather than in vitro. Although the ns2 protein encoded by ORF2 of MHV is not required for viral replication in tissue culture (Schwarz et al., 1990) , deletion of this protein or a single amino acid substitution leads to a significant in vivo attenuation of the virus (de Haan et al., 2002; Sperry et al., 2005) . Whether p4.7 of ECoV plays a role in viral pathogenicity should be elucidated by animal experiments using NC99 and isolate Tokachi09.",

The occurrence of a long deletion, corresponding to the absence of BCoV p4.9 and p4.8, in HCoV-OC43 supports the speculation regarding a bovine-to-human direction of transmission (Vijgen et al., 2005) . To elucidate the evolutionary relationship of Betacoronavirus-1, complete genomic sequence data of isolate Tokachi09 would be required. Moreover, the finding that ECoV in Japan has a 185-nucleotide deletion resulting in the absence of p4.7 suggests that the Japanese strain probably originated from a different lineage to the North American strain. Virus isolation in other areas, especially Europe and Australia, is required to conduct epidemiological studies of this virus in horses.",

Although isolation of the causative agent was unsuccessful, the results of an RT-PCR study using fecal samples suggested that the causative agent has high similarity of the genomic sequence of the N gene (97.8%) to that of NC99 (data not shown). Therefore, it was suspected that an ECoV caused this disease outbreak. However, the agent of 2004 does not have an identical genomic sequence of the N gene (98.4%) to that of isolate Tokachi09 and does not have a 185-nucleotide deletion between the S and the E genes (data not shown), suggesting that the disease in 2009 was not caused by the same virus as that causing the 2004 cases. The reason for disease recurrence is considered to be reduction in herd immunity of horses against ECoV during the 5 years since 2004. This is suggested by the fact that the pre-sera of the horses had low antibody titers against Tokachi09 (Table 3) . For preventing such disease occurrence, and bovine enteritis by BCoV, herd immunity is crucial. Furthermore, considering the economic losses, vaccine development is necessary for biosecurity measures and to curtail this disease especially in the horse-racing field. ",
