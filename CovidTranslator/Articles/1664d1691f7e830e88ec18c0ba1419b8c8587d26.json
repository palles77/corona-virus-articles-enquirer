The fast dynamics of these interactions make necessary the existence of tightly regulated mechanisms to guarantee that each of the organelles involved in these processes retains its own identity. In addition, although often perceived as a terminal compartment, sorting and retrieval from Lys still occurs either for recycling of some of their structural components into newly forming Lys (Saftig and Klumperman, 2009; Yu et al, 2010) , or to accomplish specialized functions such as antigen presentation (Boes et al, 2002; Chow et al, 2002) , plasma membrane (PM) repair (Andrews, 2000) or cholesterol homeostasis (Lange et al, 2012) . Lysosomal identity is often preserved during these processes by the generation of projections or short tubules that emanate and eventually pinch off from the lysosomal compartment carrying the selected sorted materials in their membranes and lumen. This selective efflux of lysosomal contents may be subjected to a tight spatio-temporal regulation to avoid perturbing organelle identity, but the molecular mechanisms behind this regulation remain elusive.",

            "text": "Sorting and retrieval of cargo and constituents and efficient vesicular fusion and fission are often mediated by different protein complexes that bind to the surface of the participating compartments (Saksena et al, 2007; Bonifacino and Hurley, 2008) . The timing and fidelity in the membrane recruitment of these sorting and trafficking protein complexes is often determined by specific modifications in the lipids of the targeted membrane. In this respect, the importance of phosphorylated intermediates of phosphatidylinositol (phosphoinositides or PIPs) in vesicular maturation and trafficking is well documented (Cullen and Carlton, 2012) . For example, PI(4)P is known to participate in the regulation of trafficking in the Golgi apparatus (D'Angelo et al, 2012) and from the Golgi to Lys during lysosomal biogenesis (Salazar et al, 2009; Szentpetery et al, 2010) . PI(4)P synthesis is under the control of four PI-4-Kinases (PI4Ks) in mammalian cells (namely PI4KIIa, PI4KIIb, PI4KIIIa and PI4KIIIb) (Balla and Balla, 2006; Minogue and Waugh, 2012) . Differences in the intracellular location of these kinases determine the trafficking events primarily modulated by each of them. Thus, PI4KIIIa and PI4KIIb are considered responsible for PI(4)P synthesis at the PM whereas PI4KIIa and PI4KIIIb are the major contributors of Golgi PI(4)P (Balla and Balla, 2006; Minogue and Waugh, 2012) . PI4KIIa can also be detected in endosomal-lysosomal compartments where it modulates essential sorting events (Salazar et al, 2009) . In contrast, PI4KIIIb has gained prominence as the PI4K isoform primarily associated with the myriad of Golgi-related functions modulated by PI(4)P, such as membrane trafficking from Golgi-to-cell surface, glycosylation at the Golgi, lipid metabolism and sphingolipid transport and cytokinesis (Polevoy et al, 2009; D'Angelo et al, 2012) . PI4KIIa and PI4KIIIb can act sequentially in Golgi and endosomes, respectively, as for example in the PI(4)P-dependent delivery of the lysosomal membrane protein LIMP2 (Jovic et al, 2012) . To date, only a few extra-Golgi functions have been described for PI4KIIIb such as its participation in regulated exocytosis of secretory granules (de Barry et al, 2006) and virus entry and replication (Yang et al, 2012) .",

In this study, we identify a novel role for PI(4)P in the maintenance of lysosomal identity through the regulation of trafficking and sorting events occurring directly at the lysosomal membrane. We demonstrate that the PI4K isoform PI4KIIIb, likely through generation of lysosomal PI(4)P in situ, contributes to control the lysosomal efflux. This control occurs at two levels: (1) on the regulation of the magnitude of lysosomal vesiculation and efficient excision-likely by preventing random assembly of the clathrin-coat forming machinery at the lysosomal membraneand (2) on the sorting of lysosomal constituents. The sorting function of PI4KIIIb becomes particularly relevant under conditions of high demand for recycling of lysosomal components, such as in the context of lysosomal regeneration after starvation, where we demonstrate that loss of PI4KIIIb leads to exit of lysosomal cargo along with the recycled material.",

As expected from the well-characterized functions of PI4KIIIb at the Golgi, mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3 cells) stably transduced with lentivirus carrying shRNA to knockdown PI4KIIIb (75\u00b18% decrease in protein and mRNA levels) have reduced (1.5\u00b10.4-fold) in-bulk protein secretion (Supplementary Figure S1A ). Live-cell microscopy analysis of cells transfected with monomeric red ( \u00c0 RFP) or yellow ( \u00c0 YFP) fluorescence protein-tagged LAMP1 revealed a striking amount of fluorescent long tubular structures (average length 45 mm) in the PI4KIIIb( \u00c0 ) cells, in clear contrast with the few tubular projections occasionally observed in control cells (o2 mm long) ( Figure 1D -G; Supplementary Figure S1B-D; Supplementary Movie S1). Tubules emanated from LAMP1-positive compartments scattered throughout the cytoplasm and in the perinuclear region ( Figure 1D ; Supplementary Figure S1B). Treatment with nocodazole abrogated both the mobility of the LAMP1-positive components and the formation of tubular projections ( Figure 1H ; Supplementary Movie S1). Although less pronounced, this phenotype of LAMP1 tubulation was also observed in a PI4KIIIb knockdown of lower efficiency (48% decrease in protein levels) (Supplementary Figure S1E and F).",

LAMP1 clusters did not appreciably overlap either with the cis-Golgi marker, GM130 or with the trans-Golgi marker GGA3 ( Figure 3A and C). Knockdown of PI4KIIIb slightly increased colocalization between LAMP1 and the trans-Golgi resident protein Sialyltransferase when compared with control cells ( Figure 3A and C), suggesting that a small fraction of the protein is retained in the Golgi, in agreement with the described contribution of PI4KIIIb to Golgi exit of LAMP1 (Jovic et al, 2012) . However, most of the LAMP1 protein was still efficiently transported out of the Golgi as the LAMP1 clusters were detected in regions devoid of these Golgi markers ( Figure 3A ). Analysis of live cells co-expressing LAMP1-RFP and the fluorescent-tagged trans-Golgi proteins Galactosyltransferase, FAPP-PH or GGA1, also confirmed that LAMP1 tubules originate, for the most part, from regions different from those highlighted by the Golgi proteins ( Figure We then observed that changes in LAMP1 dynamics in PI4KIIIb( \u00c0 ) cells were not directly linked to alterations in Golgi structure or function because LAMP1 clusters were still visible after Golgi disruption by nocodazole and did not cosegregate with GM130-labelled Golgi fragments ( Figure 3D and E). Similar results were observed after treatment of cells with brefeldin A (BFA) that inhibits ER to Golgi transport ( Figure 3D and E). Live-cell imaging confirmed that none of these treatments affected formation of LAMP1 tubules in PI4KIIIb( \u00c0 ) cells ( Figure 3F ; Supplementary Movie S3). These results support that the previously described function of PI4KIIIb in regulating Golgi exit is different from its inhibitory effect on LAMP1 tubulation and that this additional function of PI4KIIIb mainly takes place in a post-Golgi organelle.",

This protein decorates the inner and outer membrane of autophagosomes and is transferred to Lys upon fusion between both compartments. The tandem construct highlights autophagosomes with both fluorophores and Lys only with mCherry since GFP is sensitive to the lysosomal acidic pH. We found that only mCherry-LC3 labelled the tubular projections in PI4KIIIb( \u00c0 ) fibroblasts ( Figure 4B ; Supplementary Movie S5; control cells shown in Supplementary Figure S4B ) indicating that they originate from autolysosomes (red) and not from autophagosomes (red and green).

Immunoblot revealed a significant reduction in the levels of integral membrane proteins (LAMP1, LAMP-2A, LAMP-2B, V-ATPase) and resident lumenal enzymes (Cathepsin B, Cathepsin D, Cathepsin L) ( Figure 4C ). The lower levels of lysosomal constituents in PI4KIIIb( \u00c0 ) cells are not due to their reduced synthesis or stability in this compartment (as has been described in certain pathological conditions before; Kiffin et al, 2007 ; Rodriguez-Navarro et al, 2012) because we did not find significant differences in the mRNA levels of lysosomal proteins between control and knockdown cells ( Figure 4D ) and incubation of intact Lys in an isotonic media did not reveal faster degradation rates for LAMPs in PI4KIIIb( \u00c0 ) cells ( Figure 4E ). We also analysed trafficking of LAMPs from Golgi to Lys and found that LAMP1 was delivered to Lys with similar kinetics in control and PI4KIIIb-deficient cells when released from a trans-Golgi network (TGN) temperature block (Supplementary Figure  S5A ). This preservation of Golgi exit of LAMPs towards the Lys in PI4KIIIb( \u00c0 ) cells contrasted with the marked reduction in the kinetics of Golgi-to-cell surface transport in these cells (B2-fold reduction of VSVG exit from the Golgi shown in Supplementary Figure S5B ). These findings support that the previously described regulatory effect of PI4KIIIb in Golgi exit is selective for a subset of cargo (preferentially the one targeted to the PM) and that a compromise in LAMPs efflux from Golgi was not the main cause for their reduced lysosomal content.",

This enhanced efflux of lysosomal resident proteins and cargo could explain why p62, a cargo receptor for selective autophagy, did not accumulate inside PI4KIIIb( \u00c0 ) fibroblasts ( Figure 4C ). Upon separation of cellular lysates in a continuous sucrose density gradient, lysosomal constituent proteins (LAMP1 and Cathepsin D) revealed a slight shift towards denser regions in the case of PI4KIIIb( \u00c0 ) fibroblasts (Supplementary Figure S5C) , further supporting efflux of these components from Lys.",

            "text": "We next investigated whether PI4KIIIb might regulate lysosomal tubulation by directly acting in this compartment. Immunoblot of different subcellular fractions from rat liver revealed that most of PI4KIIIb is present in cytosol and the Golgi but that a fraction (20 \u00b1 9%) of this protein can be detected in Lys ( Figure 5A ). Immunofluorescence and immunogold staining for PI4KIIIb in the isolated lysosomal fractions demonstrated that most of PI4KIIIb (91 \u00b1 4%) localized in LAMP1-labelled compartments morphologically identified as Lys (Supplementary Figure S5D and E) . Immunofluorescence for PI4KIIIb in cultured cells ( Figure 5B ) confirmed its colocalization with LAMP1 (18.7 \u00b1 5%) and LAMP2 (26.9 \u00b1 1.3%) in agreement with the levels found when Lys were isolated from these cells (Supplementary Figure S6A) . The absence of PI4KIIIb in some of the LAMP-positive compartments could be a result of the characteristic heterogeneity of the lysosomal compartment. However, opposite to typical lysosomal substrates, levels of PI4KIIIb in Lys did not increase upon blockade of lysosomal proteolysis in cultured cells ( Figure S6B ) or in mouse liver ( Figure 5C ) (note that levels of PI4KIIa, also present in Lys, markedly increased (B4-fold) when lysosomal proteolysis was inhibited, suggesting that PI4KIIa is normally degraded in Lys); the decrease in levels of constituent lysosomal proteins in the fractions treated with inhibitors is relative and it results from the increase of undegraded cargo in these fractions. In fact, most Lys-associated PI4KIIIb was located at the lysosomal membrane instead of in the lysosomal matrix ( Figure 5D ; GAPDH is shown as well-characterized lysosomal substrate) and was accessible to degradation by exogenous proteases (trypsin) (Supplementary Figure S6C) , supporting its association with the cytosolic side of the lysosomal membrane. PI4KIIIb could be released from the lysosomal membrane after a high-concentration salt wash (58.6 \u00b1 10.8% released) or alkaline wash (77.2\u00b14.8% released) (Supplementary Figure S6D) and mainly localized outside cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains (Supplementary Figure S6E) supporting dynamic association of this kinase with the lysosomal membrane. Lastly, bidimensional electrophoresis and immunoblot for PI4KIIIb revealed distinctive isoelectric properties for the Lys-associated PI4KIIIb when compared to the cytosolic and the Golgi variants ( Figure 5E ). The lysosomal pool of PI4KIIIb was comprised mainly of a net negatively charged isoform (BpI 3.5), thus, discarding possible Golgi contamination in the lysosomal fraction, and supporting specific characteristics of the Lys-associated form of PI4KIIIb. Treatment of Lys with a serine/threonine/tyrosine l-phosphatase shifted the Lysassociated PI4KIIIb towards a net neutral-positive charge (B7.9-8.8), suggesting that phosphorylation of PI4KIIIb may be a prerequisite for its Lys association ( Figure 5F ).",

We attribute the presence of a high percentage of Lys negative for this kinase to the characteristic morphological and functional heteroge-neity of the lysosomal population and to the fact that LAMP1 will label both Lys but also late endosomes (Cuervo et al, 1997; Koga et al, 2010) . We also found a weak but consistent association of the PI(4)P-binding probe FAPP-PH-GFP to isolated Lys in vitro (Supplementary Figure S6F) . Furthermore, in agreement with recent studies (Rong et al, 2012) , we were able to detect de novo synthesis of PIP species in the range of monophosphoinositides when we subjected isolated Lys to an in vitro kinase assay. Interestingly, levels of de novo PIP synthesis in Lys were only B1.5-fold lesser than those observed in isolated Golgi membranes ( Figure 5H ). The fact that the only other PI4K detected in Lys, PI4KIIa, was mainly presented in the lysosomal lumen where it undergoes rapid degradation ( Figure 5C ), lead us to propose that most of the PI(4)P generated in Lys is a result of PI4KIIIb activity.",

Consequently, we first examined possible changes in the lysosomal association of clathrin and its cognate adaptors in PI4KIIIb-deficient cells and found that levels of clathrin (Clath HC) were markedly increased (B3-fold) in Lys isolated from PI4KIIIb( \u00c0 ) cells ( Figure 6A ).

PI4KIIIb, clathrin and lysosomal membrane proteins (LAMP1 shown here) demonstrated a gradual enrichment towards the smaller sized vesicles ( Figure 6C ). Immunogold for PI4KIIIb in these vesicles confirmed that they were intact vesicular structures of 0.05-0.1 mm diameter (Supplementary Figure S7A) and revealed frequent coincidence of PI4KIIIb and LAMP1 in the same vesicles ( Figure 6D ). The fact that PI4KIIIb was also detectable decorating short LAMP1 tubules emerging from Lys, and that part of PI4KIIIb in the vesicular fraction displayed an isoelectric point similar to that observed for lysosomal PI4KIIIb (Figure 6E ), strongly supported that some of these PI4KIIIb-positive vesicular carriers may normally originate from lysosomes. We propose that some of these small vesicular carriers would be responsible for the discrete exiting and recycling of lysosomal components under normal conditions, and that clearly contrasts with the pronounced PI4KIIIb and lysosomal identity S Sridhar et al loss of lysosomal materials trough the abnormal tubules that form in the absence of PI4KIIIb. Proteomic analysis of the vesicles positive for PI4KIIIb, purified out of the smaller vesicular fraction using anti-PI4KIIIb-conjugated magnetic beads, revealed that the most abundant proteins in these vesicular carriers fall into one of these three categories: clathrin and adaptor molecules, proteins involved in vesicular fusion/fission and",

Comparison of the association of each of these components with carriers isolated from control and PI4KIIIb( \u00c0 ) cells ( Figure 6F ) revealed that loss of PI4KIIIb led to markedly higher association of clathrin (B3.5-fold), the adaptor AP-2 (B2.8-fold) and the plus-end directed motor Kif13b (45-fold) to these vesicles and to higher content of lysosomal constituents (LAMP1 and Cath D shown here) ( Figure 6F ). The increase in AP-2 was in clear contrast to the pronounced (B3-fold) decrease in AP-3. Although more discrete, we also observed enhanced association of Rab7, Rab9 and Rab11 in the PI4KIIIb-defective carriers ( Figure 6F ). Out of the three Rabs, Rab9 colocalized with the LAMP1 tubules ( Figure 6B ; Supplementary Figure S6 ) in PI4KIIIb( \u00c0 ) cells, suggesting its possible involvement in lysosomal tubulation. Pull-down experiments for PI4KIIIb from vesicular fractions demonstrated lack of interaction between this kinase and clathrin, whereas AP-2 and the motor protein Kif13b could be recovered in complex with PI4KIIIb along with lysosomal constituents such as LAMP1 ( Figure 6G ). It is possible that the inability of adaptor and motor proteins to precisely dock onto molecules of PI4KIIIb at the lysosomal membrane and on the surface of the carrier vesicles in cells defective in this protein leads to their random association with the membrane of both structures.",

To start elucidating the possible interplay between PI4KIIIb and these PIP5Ks in the regulation of lysosomal efflux, we performed single and double knockdowns for PIP5K1B or PIP5K1A and PI4KIIIb in fibroblasts (Supplementary Figure S8A) , and analysed changes in LAMP1 dynamics during lysosomal reformation. As previously described, knockdown of PIP5K1B almost completely abolished tubule formation and lead to enlarged autolysosomes ( Figure 8A ; Supplementary Movie S8), whereas cells knocked down for PIP5K1A still formed tubules, which often were longer and with less buds (proposed to be indicative of defective scission at the tip of the tubule due to reduced PI(4,5)P 2 levels) ( Figure 8A ; Supplementary Movie S8). These elongated tubules were even more evident when PI4KIIIb was also knocked down in these cells ( Figure 8B ), supporting that the absence of PI(4)P further reduced the amount of PI(4,5)P 2 available at the tips for vesicular fission. Staining with pepsptain A revealed that in the absence of PIP5K1A, despite hypertubulation, the luminal content was efficiently retained in Lys whereas it gained access to tubules when the PI4KIIIb knockdown was superimposed on those cells ( Figure 8B ). These results highlight the dependence on PI4KIIIb but not on PIP5K1A for proper sorting.",

Furthermore, in about 20% of these double knockdown cells, we found an even more severe phenotype in which most lysosomal compartments seem to be interconnected by very large tubules and the lysosomal content (highlighted by fluorescent pepstatin A) flows through them as a continuum compartment (Supplementary Figure S8B) . These results highlight that persistence of tubulation and inefficient sorting results in loss of lysosomal identity. We conclude that changes in the PI(4)P levels at the lysosomal membrane modulate conversion from vesicular to tubular transport and that conditions that reduce levels of this lipid product (i.e., loss of production by PI4KIIIb or active conversion into PI(4,5)P 2 by PIP5K1B) favour tubulation. The sequential action of PI4KIIIb and PIP5Ks at the lysosomal membrane determines this switch between vesicular and tubular lysosomal efflux. Furthermore, PI4KIIIb prevents undesirable exit of lysosomal constituent proteins under normal conditions and facilitates proper sorting when recycling of lysosomal material is needed, such as in the physiological context of lysosomal reformation after prolonged starvation.",

Exit of molecules from Lys in tubulo-vesicular structures has been described under different conditions, although in all those cases cargo and constitutive lysosomal components are sorted out before the efflux (Yu et al, 2010) . Our finding that loss of PI4KIIIb results in loss of lysosomal contents through uncontrolled tubulation, suggests a dual role for PI4KIIIb in vesicle formation and cargo sorting, and highlights the importance of this enzyme in maintaining the identity of the lysosomal compartment by retaining lysosomal components while lysosomal efflux occurs. Only the catalytically active form of PI4KIIIb can rescue the hypertubulating lysosomal phenotype, supporting that its function is contingent on PI(4)P generation.

It is plausible that PI(4)P at the lysosomal membrane facilitates efficient fission of carrier lysosomal vesicles-presumably by recruiting protein complexes involved in membrane scission-and that, in the absence of PI4KIIIb( \u00c0 ) the inability to perform vesicle fission leads instead to formation of the elongated tubular structures (Figure 9 ). The augmented lysosomal association of clathrin, adaptor proteins and motor molecules when PI4KIIIb is absent could independently contribute to this transformation of vesicles into tubules, by actively stretching the forming vesicles. However, it is also possible that abnormally bound clathrin and adaptors inhibit vesicle fission by occupying the docking sites of scission molecules. The reasons for enhanced binding of AP-2 and clathrin to Lys in the absence of PI4KIIIb require further investigation, but we propose that it may reflect a failure to confine them at specific membrane locations. These molecules usually identify target membranes by recognizing phosphoinositides in combination with at least one other membrane determinant (Carlton and Cullen, 2005) . If PI(4)P or any of its downstream products are part of this dual signal, then their loss would not abrogate membrane Coordinated function of PI4KIIIb and PIP5Ks during lysosomal reformation after prolonged starvation.

Lysosomal PI4KIIIb may contribute the PI(4)P used by these kinases to generate PI(4,5)P 2 , required for specific recruitment of clathrin and adaptor molecules to the sites of lysosomal budding. However, if PI(4)P would be merely serving as a supply for PI(4,5)P 2 generation and this would be the lipid species required for tubule formation, then tubules would not form in PI4KIIIb-deficient cells. The increase in tubule formation that we observe in the absence of PI4KIIIb is independent of presence or absence of PIP5Ks, which suggests that rather than acting as a passive source of PI(4,5)P 2 , PI(4)P actively prevents tubule formation, likely by facilitating vesicle fission. During conditions of massive lysosomal efflux, the active conversion of PI(4)P to PI(4,5)P 2 at specific membrane sites where PIP5K1B localizes may favour conversion of vesicles into elongated tubular carriers by preventing fission. Vesicular fission from the tip of these tubular carriers may still require PI4KIIIb acting sequentially with PIP5K1A, which has been proposed to facilitate recruitment of the scission machinery at the tubules tips (Rong et al, 2012) (in fact when both PI4KIIIb and PIP5K1A are missing we observed the smoothest tubules with the lowest content of buds; see Supplementary Figure S8C ).",

PI4KIIIb functions there in part in a coordinated manner with PIP5K1B and PIP5K1A by providing the substrate that mediates their functions in restrictive clathrin recruitment at the lysosomal membrane and vesicular scission at the tips of the tubules, respectively.

            "text": "Overall, our findings highlight the need for PI(4)P at the lysosomal membrane to control lysosomal efflux at the level of vesicle formation and cargo sorting. Changes in the exquisite balance between PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P 2 in Lys may be used by cells to facilitate massive regulated exit of specific lysosomal components when needed. It is likely that rather than absolute values of each PIP, their gradients in different areas of the membrane are the ones ultimately regulating sorting and carrier formation. We propose that this new function of PI4KIIIb in Lys should have an impact on many aspects of lysosomal biology and on cellular processes requiring efficient recycling of lysosomal material. Figure 9 Hypothetical model for the role of PI4KIIIb in the regulation of lysosomal efflux. Left: Association of PI4KIIIb with lysosomes is necessary for (1) sorting of exiting recycled components and retention of intrinsic lysosomal components and (2) regulated formation of the vesicular carriers involved in this recycling. We propose that PI4KIIIb contributes to completion of vesicle formation/fission from the lysosome in part by regulating the dynamic association/dissociation of clathrin and its adaptor molecules to the sites of vesicle formation. Reduction of lysosomal PI(4)P levels, for example by conversion into PI(4,5)P 2 , favors a switch from vesicular to tubular carriers when abundant lysosomal efflux is needed likely by modifying vesicle fission rates. Right: The absence of PI4KIIIb results in (1) unrestricted association of clathrin-coat components and motor molecules to the lysosomal surface and budding vesicles; (2) abnormal formation of lysosome emanating tubules and (3) missorting of luminal components into exiting tubules. Tubule formation may be a result of failure to recruit the machinery required for vesicular fission (scission molecules) and/or of vesicular stretching by the molecular motors that associate with these vesicles when PI4KIIIb is missing.",
