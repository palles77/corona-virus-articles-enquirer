Further, the conjugates 2, 3, 6, 8 and 10 have been screened for their antiviral activities against HSV, VSV, FIPV, PIV-3, RSV and FHV and the molecules 2 and 3 have shown good results with EC 50 0.011 mM and 0.029 mM against VSV and FIPV/FHV, respectively.

Turmeric, a spice used to provide specific flavor and yellow color to curry, has been used for many centuries as an Indian folklore medicine in Ayurveda -an ancient traditional system of medicine for treatment of wide range of illnesses. Current traditional Indian medicine uses it for biliary disorders, anorexia, cough, diabetic wounds, hepatic disorder, rheumatism, blood purification and rheumatoid arthritis [7] [8] [9] . Recent studies have shown curcumin as a potential molecule in the treatment of different forms of cancer, e.g., cervical cancer caused by HPV [10] [11] [12] .",

Further, blocking of phenolic groups decreases its antioxidant activity since these groups play critical role in enzymatic activity at receptor sites [20, 21] . Studies have revealed that curcumin has very low bioavailability due to its poor absorption and rapid metabolism in the liver and intestinal wall [22, 23] . Curcumin is highly hydrophobic and cannot be administered systemically. On intravenous administration, it disappears rapidly from the blood and quickly appears as metabolites in the bile [10, 24, 25] . Therefore, one of the most appreciable approaches is to make biodegradable conjugates of curcumin molecule with suitable ligands to enhance its cellular uptake. For preparing bioconjugate of curcumin, amino acids and fatty acids -natural components of bacterial cell wall, and folic acid -a cofactor in the synthesis of thymidine and other nucleotides, were selected [26] [27] [28] [29] . These bioconjugates are supposed to enhance cellular uptake, lipophilicity of the molecule and sustained release of drug molecule to improve the half-life and reduce the rate of metabolism of curcumin molecule inside the cell.",

UV measurements were carried out on Hitachi 220S spectrophotometer. 1 H NMR spectra were recorded using DRX 300 Instrument with DMSO as solvent using TMS as an internal standard. 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on Varian XL-300 and Bruker AM-200 spectrometers operating at 75 and 50 MHz, respectively. All solvents were dried and distilled prior to use.",
