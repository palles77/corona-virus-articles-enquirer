Transmission of healthcareassociated pathogens takes place through air, droplets, and hand contact by medical staff [3] [4] [5] [6] . Contamination of equipment has been identified as a major reservoir of pathogens associated with HAI [3] [4] [5] [6] . Relevant studies have shown that surfaces in the rooms of hospitalized patients who have been infected with or colonized by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are more likely to be contaminated with these bacteria than surfaces in rooms housing patients without MRSA or VRE infection [3, 4] . This indicates that pathogens like MRSA or VRE can be transmitted to the environment by patients. Although hand hygiene has already become a focal point at various hospitals worldwide and is expected to have a major effect on reducing the rates of HAI, other measures are needed to reduce the colonization density in the hospital environment so that the chain of infection can be disrupted [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

Bio-Kil molecules have a high-affinity structure and a strong electric field that effectively attracts pathogens [19] . Their strong electrical charge damages the membrane proteins of microorganisms, thereby killing the pathogens [19] . Bio-Kil forms a permanent, covalent bond with the surface of the textile fibers. Even after the textiles have been washed 50 times, the product still retains more than 90 % of its bacteria-killing power [19, 20] . Depending on the frequency with which the textiles are washed, treatment only needs to be repeated every 3 to 6 months in order to maintain a long-term bactericidal effect [19, 20] . In the same ICU environment and its instruments, such as nursing station desktops, workbenches, telephones, computer keyboards, and surfaces close to the patients, the catalyst will directly form a covalent bond with the surface of these objects, where it will have a long-term, bactericidal effect [19] . As it reduces the possibility of contamination of textiles, environments, and instruments, it lowers the environmental bacterial count in the hospital, thus reducing HAI due to bacterial colonization [20] .",

Since cross transmission due to direct physician-patient contact plays a major role in HAI caused by exogenous pathogens [17] , handwashing to break the chain of transmission has remained the most critical and preventing intervention in HAI control ever since the era of Semmelweis [7] .

However, the incidence of MDR outbreaks such as carbapenem-resistant or pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii , or vancomycin-resistant enterococci has increased recently [3, 4, 13, 17, 18] . A series of studies have demonstrated that physician-environment-patient transmission of HAIs was the result of indirect contact with the hospital environment or the patient's surroundings [14, 23] . Ohl et al. suggested a potential link between transmission of pathogens to patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) who do not perform hand hygiene after touching the curtains [15] . As such, environmental disinfection has been emphasized in recent years to compensate for inadequate adherence to hand hygiene. In addition to cleaning on patient's discharge to reduce the chances of MDRO transmission from a previous occupant to a new occupant [16, 22] , environmental disinfection of a patient's bed and surroundings should be performed to control MDR [17, 18] . However, for manual surface cleaning and disinfection there has always been a risk of quality instability due to poorly controlled processes or, arguably, the possibly undertrained and incompetent hands of housekeeping staff [17, 18] .",

Several environment disinfection control models have been developed, including surface coating and photocatalyzing or ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (for surface and air sterilization), and copper and silver nanofilms [9-11, 22, 24, 25] . Yet, there are still barriers to overcome before they are adopted as standard clinical applications, some with long D-values and repopulation of bacteria in a short time. Instead, as we observed in present study, Bio-Kil reacts within seconds and maintains a constant effect for up to 6 months depending on the surfaces to which it is applied. Airborne transmission of hospital pathogens and their contribution to the burden of HAI has been well described [5, 11, 26, 27] . A novel hydroxyl radical air disinfection system (Inov8 unit) has been reported to improve air quality and reduce environmental contamination in health care settings [11, 27] . A previous study in a regional hospital in Taiwan showed that the addition of Bio-Kil apparently reduced the bacteria count by up to 47 % (from 108.8 CFU/h/plate to 68.6 CFU/h/plate) [5] . Similar findings were also observed in the present study.",

These organisms were associated with an increasing incidence of life-threatening infections in hospitalized patients [17, 18, [28] [29] [30] . Furthermore, the low sample size (only two rooms) and the lack of detailed clinical characteristics of patients admitted to these two rooms (infections or contamination) and the following further infection prevention for the next patients admitted to these two rooms were also the limitations of this study. Further work is also required to validate whether reducing the burden of these organisms in the environment will minimize the risk of HAI.",
