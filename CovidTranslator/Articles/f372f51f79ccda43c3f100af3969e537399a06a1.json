            "text": "While hepatitis has been described for centuries, it was only in the 19 th century that a connection was made between jaundice and diseases affecting the hepatocytes. The term hepatitis is Greek, meaning inflammatory disease of the liver. The causes may be numerous, with several types of hepatitis being identified, such as viral (specific or nonspecific), bacterial, toxic (e.g. drugs, herbals, alcohol consumption, food), immunologic (autoimmune), metabolic (Wilson's disease), and vascular compromise of hepatic perfusion. Viral hepatitis affects hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide, particularly in developing countries. However, the incidence can be high in industrialized countries as well.",

            "text": "Seven hepatitis viruses were identified during a thirty year period . The recent discovery of the hepatitis G virus suggests that the list may not be complete as yet. Accepted terminology differentiates hepatitis alphabetically into A, B, C, D (or delta), E, F and G. The viruses causing hepatitis are classified into two groups depending on the route of transmission. Thus, the A, E, and F (still poorly characterized) viruses have an oro-fecal transmission. These viruses can be transmitted by food, shellfish, dirty water, dirty hands, or contaminated stools. They cause epidemics and are characterized by the absence of the risk for chronic infections. The second group is comprised of type B, C, D, and G viruses that are transmitted parenterally by way of contaminated biological fluids like blood and semen. These infections are characterized by the risk of chronicity that evolves to cirrhosis and primary cancer of the liver. Use of contaminated syringes by drug abusers, blood or blood product transfusion, and transplantation of organs and hemodialysis are the most common ways for these viruses to be acquired. Sexual intercourse is a particularly important route of transmission for the type B virus. HBV and, less commonly, HCV may also be transmitted vertically from mother to child during labor. It remains to be determined whether hepatitis G virus is sexually transmitted. Viral hepatitis is an important public health problem. Primary prevention is, therefore, mandatory, if possible. Vaccines exist only for hepatitis A and B, both alone and combined. Young people in particular should be protected against both viruses, especially when traveling to countries with a high incidence of these viruses. High standards of hygiene, meticulous disinfection of instruments in the hospital environment, and non-exchange of syringes between drug addicts are practices that can lower significantly the transmission rate of these viruses. Alcohol consumption, even of moderate quantities, is a risk factor for aggravating the evolution of hepatic lesions.",

Two thirds of the infected adults present with typical flu-like symptoms and soon become jaundiced. In the remaining cases, patients are anicteric, but with elevated serum transaminases. In 1 out of 1000 cases hepatitis will evolve into the fulminant form with a mortality of 90% within 1-3 weeks from the beginning of jaundice. This unfavorable sequel is due to a hyperreaction of the host immune system against HB V. The only therapy is an urgent liver transplantation. Up to 5-10% of the infected adults exposed to HBV develop a persistent infection, while 80% of childhood cases become chronic. The natural history of chronic hepatitis evolves in four stages: 1) active multiplication of the virus; 2) immunologic effort of the host to eliminate HBV, which is usually unsuccessful; 3) HBV integration into the hepatic genome, stop of replication of the virus, and lowering of viral DNA in the serum. HbsAg remains present, although in some patients it is not expressed. Hepatic pathology is consistent either with a pattern of chronic hepatitis or even cirrhosis; 4) reactivation, during which HBV (usually the mutant type) is multiplied aggressively leading to terminal disease.

            "text": "HAV is a small picornavirus and resembles the polioviruses. The viral capsid that contains the RNA has an icosahedral structure and lacks a membrane envelope. HAV is very resistant to the external environment. It penetrates the organism by the oral route and multiplies in the hepatocytes before spreading throughout the intestine from where it is excreted (fecal excretion). HBVis an enveloped DNA virus of the family of Hepadna viruses. Its genes can be integrated in the human hepatocellular genome and be responsible for chronic infections that may progress to cirrhosis and ultimately to hepatic cancer. Three types of viral particles, the virion, the spheres and the filaments, can be identified in the serum of infected humans. The virion, or viral particle, is composed of an envelope with surface proteins and a nucleocapsid carrying the proteins of the capsid and the viral DN A. The spheres and the filaments are empty envelopes that consist of proteins and are synthesized in excess during viral replication. These empty envelopes are not infectious but highly antigenic and activate host immune mechanisms against the virus. Hepatitis B is a very contagious disease because HBV is present in most of the biological fluids of the infected individual, including blood, sexual secretions, saliva, urine, and milk. However, data regarding infectivity are consistent with viral concentrations in serum and semen. Moreover, because the virus is relatively resistant in the environment it survives for days in an external medium or for up to 10 hours at 60 o C and for 5 min at 100 o C. It is very resistant in ether, 90% alcohol, and to extremely cold temperatures. HCV is a small RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family, other members of which are the flaviviruses. Like all RNA viruses it is subject to a high frequency of mutations and exists in the form of ''quasi'' species in the infected individuals Maddrey (2000) . For many of the single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses, most of the viral non-structural proteins and some cellular proteins form a multi-protein complex to direct the replication of the viral RNA genome. Although the mechanisms of HCV template RNA replication are not well defined, it is believed that they may follow a similar pattern. The greatest hindrances to understanding HCV infection is the low level of HCV particles in plasma and the lack of an efficient cell culture system for the virus.To date it has not been possible to grow HCV reliably and efficiently in a laboratory cell culture of cells. This has decelerated critical studies on the biochemical and functional properties of the viral proteins, as well as on understanding the steps of the viral life cycle and its interactions with the host cell. HCV resists immune defenses and can induce chronic infections. It is known that HCV blocks the interferon-induced antiviral host response, which is thought to be responsible for the failure of interferon-based treatment of this disorder. Hepatitis D (HDV)is a viroid, which is a defective or incomplete virus that can multiply only in the presence of HBV virus. HDV borrows the envelope from HBV, which makes it capable of attaching to and to entering hepatocytes. Its genome is a circular RNA molecule that can replicate autonomously. However, in the absence of HBV, that acts as a helper. Delta virus cannot be secreted from the hepatic cell. Hepatitis Eis an RNA single stranded, non-enveloped virus. It shares similarities with the Calciviridae/Alpha super group family, like Norwalk, rubella and plant furoviruses. It is spherical and has a larger volume than HA V. Unlike HAV, it is a very fragile virus, with its conservation requiring storage at-80 o C. Its life in the environment is probably very short. Hepatitis appears in the form of epidemics that are often last long. Geographically, E virus can be found in India, the former Soviet Union, Southeast Asia, and Mexico. The disease manifests similar to very hepatitis A, with symptoms that can last approximately two weeks. HGV,like thehepatitis C virus, is a Flavivirus. The three types of HGV are GBV.A, a virus of the tamarin monkeys transmissible to humans and vice-versa, GBV.B and GBV.C, human viruses isolated from the virus of an African patient. It was discovered in 1995. The HGV virus or viruses are single stranded RNA viruses. HGV has no little clinical significance as the disease caused by this virus appears to be mild and self-limiting. HGV can, however, be associated with HBV and HCV infections. HGV alone, or in association with HCV, has been implicated in fulminant hepatitis.",

Studies coming from Taiwan, a country with a high HBV prevalence, report a decline on hepatocellular carcinoma incidence as a result of a general population vaccination strategy. Over the last years a recombinant HBV vaccine has been put in use worldwide. HBV vaccination is highly effective >95% of individuals. Revaccination works in 30-50% of those who fail to respond to the primary vaccination. Revaccination is not recommended after two series. Protective titters are those over 10 mlu/ml. Vaccination is indicated for new-borns of HBV positive mothers, HBV negative children in high endemic areas, family members of HBV positive patients, dialysis patients, and frequently transfused and HBV negative social workers. There are no significant side effects associated with vaccination. Three different strategies have been used in developing HAV vaccines: a live attenuated virus vaccine, an inactivated virus vaccine, and a recombinant vaccine. All of them are highly effective in promoting the development of protective antibodies. However, the recombinant form appears to be the least expensive and safest. Vaccination is found to be cost-effective when traveling to high HAV incidence countries occurs three or more times in a decade, or if staying there is longer than six months.",

It consists of spherical, enveloped particles 42-47nm diameter containing partially d/s DNA plus an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (i.e., reverse transcriptase): http:// www.tulane.edu/~dmsander/WWW/335/HBV.html Hepatitis Cvirus (HCV) is a small RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. Like all RNA viruses it is subjected to a high frequency of mutations. It resists immune defenses and can induce chronic infections: http://www.tulane.edu/~dmsander/WWW/ 335/HCV.html Hepatitis D virusis a viroid. Similar to plant virus satellite RNAs, it is a defective transmissible pathogen dependent on HBV for replication. Its genome is a circular RNA molecule that can replicate autonomously. However, HDV cannot be secreted from hepatic cells in the absence of HBV: http://www.tulane.edu/~dmsander/WWW/335/ HDV.html Hepatitis E virusis an RNA single strand, non-enveloped virus. It is spherical and of larger volume than the HAV: http://www.tulane.edu/~dmsander/WWW/335/HEV. html Hepatitis F virus was first identified by Deka and Coll in 1994 in patients with non-A and non-B hepatitis.While their findings have not been confirmed, the existence of this virus is probable since there has been at least one epidemic of non-A, non-B hepatitis that was not due to HE V. Infections due to the F virus appear to be very rare. Hepatitis G virus (HGV), like theHepatitis C virus, belongs to the family of Flaviviruses: http://www.tulane.edu/~dmsander/WWW/335/HGV.html Hepatitis A belongs to the family of Polio viruses. Hepatitis B belongs to the family of Hepadna viruses. It is the prototype member of the family Hepadna viridae. Although It contains reverse transcriptase activity, HBV being a DNA virus is not classified as a retrovirus: http://www.tulane.edu/~dmsander/WWW/ 335/Retroviruses.html Hepatitis C, hepaC virus genus, member of the Flaviviridae family. Hepatitis D.The HDV genome is a unique chimeric molecule with some of the properties of a satellite virus and some of a viroid Hepatitis E is classified in the family of Calici viridae. Studies suggest that E virus is very similar to the rubella virus.",
