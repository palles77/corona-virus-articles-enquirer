Unless the patient has bacteraemia or pleural empyema, aetiological diagnostics are limited and antibiotic treatment is empirical. Published data on expected response to therapy are scarce. To determine the clinical response to antibiotic treatment in a developed country in otherwise healthy children with community-acquired pneumonia, we conducted a prospective study of 153 hospitalised children with pneumonia. The role of 17 microbes as potential causative agents was evaluated. The duration of fever (>37.5\u00b0C) and hospitalisation were studied as objective measures of recovery. A potential aetiology was found in 83% of 153 patients: 29% of the patients had sole viral and 26% sole bacterial and 29% mixed viral-bacterial infections. The median duration of fever after the onset of antibiotic treatment (mainly penicillin G) was 14 h and the median duration of hospitalisation was 48 h. Patients with mixed viralbacterial infection became afebrile more slowly than those with either sole viral or sole bacterial infections. Conclusion: The findings indicate that in a developed country, children with pneumonia make a rapid, uneventful recovery needing only a short hospital stay. Expensive and time-consuming microbiological investigations are not required once bacterial sepsis has been excluded.",

Several direct and indirect aetiological studies suggest that Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the most common bacteria causing CAP [14, 21, 33] . Increasing lack of susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to penicillin and macrolides, lack of susceptibility of M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae to betalactams and increasing betalactamase production of H. influenzae suggest that one single antibiotic may not be effective in all cases of pneumonia. Furthermore, in up to 50% of CAP cases in children, there is evidence of viral infection [14, 27] .",

The main causes of hospitalisation were high fever, dyspnoea, malaise/lethargy, vomiting or poor appetite. The diagnosis was based on a simultaneous finding of infiltrates compatible with pneumonia on the chest X-ray film as well as signs and symptoms of acute infection and fever (>37.5\u00b0C). The role of 17 microbes (10 viruses and 7 bacteria) was studied. The details of the methods and microbiological findings have been reported earlier [14] . In brief, antibody tests with acute and convalescent serum samples were used for bacterial diagnosis. Viral diagnosis was based on virus culture, sensitive immunoassay for the antigens of seven viruses and a polymerase-chain-reaction assay for rhinoviruses from nasopharyngeal aspirates and serological tests with acute and convalescent sera. A blood sample for blood culture was taken from 125 patients and only one patient was found positive for S. pneumoniae. Of the 254 patients, 61 had received antibiotic treatment before hospitalisation, 23 patients had no fever on the ward, and at the time of hospitalisation and onset of antibiotic treatment, four patients had complicated pneumonia (two patients had empyema, one patient bronchiectasis and one a cystic malformation of lung). In addition, 13 patients had severe underlying chronic conditions (six had genetic syndromes, six neurocognitive disorders and one astrocytoma). All these 101 patients were excluded from the analysis and thus 153 patients were included in the study. The antibiotic treatment was chosen by the attendant physician. The median age of the 153 patients was 2.3 years (range 0.1-16.7 years). Twenty-one (14%) patients were 0 to 11 months of age, 46 (30%) 12 to 23 months of age, 49 (32%) 2 to 4 years of age and 37 (24%) were 5 years of age or older. Of the patients, 53% were boys. Of the 153 patients, 18 had stable bronchial asthma, 5 atopy, 3 had been premature, 2 had congenital heart disease, 2 had epilepsy in addition to bronchial asthma, 1 had diabetes mellitus, 1 had recovered from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and 123 patients (80%) were healthy.",

In developed countries, independent of aetiology and the type of antibiotics used, 70%-94% of children with uncomplicated CAP have been found to be afebrile and clinically improving within 48 h after the start of antibiotics [7, 27, 30] . The clinical responses are often reportedly good or leading to cure in 84%-98% of CAP patients, without any more detailed daily data on their recovery [2, 10, 28] . Even children with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia have become afebrile within an average of 22 h after onset of antimicrobial therapy. A rapid clinical recovery has been associated with rapid normalisation of WBC and CRP [30] . This is in sharp contrast to data on pneumonia in less-developed countries, where severe pneumonia is common and 5% of the patients die in spite of parenteral antibiotic treatment and treatment failures are not rare in patients with nonsevere pneumonia (18% of patients in one study still had CAP-related symptoms after 5-7 days) [4, 9] . Only 9% of the children with CAP had fever for \u202148 h after onset of antibiotic treatment. Of these patients, 75% had evidence of viral infection, usually with concomitant bacterial infection. Many findings support the view that mixed viral-bacterial infections, which may be more common than earlier recognised, may induce a more severe inflammation and clinical illness than sole bacterial or sole viral infections.",

The same finding was obtained when only sole RSV and sole pneumococcal pneumonia were studied. It can be argued that all our patients with CAP may have had a bacterial pneumonia and the tests used to detect a bacterial infection were too insensitive. This is supported by the finding that pneumolysin PCR analysis of blood samples may detect cases overlooked by serology [18, 31] . Furthermore, serological tests do not detect all blood culture positive cases [12] . On the other hand, our patients with sole bacterial pneumonia differed significantly from those with sole viral pneumonia both in laboratory and chest radiography findings, showing that the serological tests detected a bacterial type infection [15, 32] . Another explanation could be the high spontaneous cure rate of CAP in children, as studies with acute otitis media and acute sinusitis have also shown [24, 25] . Penicillin G is still considered a drug of choice in hospitalised children with CAP in many European countries with low penicillin resistance of pneumococci [11, 19, 26] . Of our patients, 66% were treated with penicillin G and showed a rapid and uneventful recovery. Penicillin G is no longer recommended in the United States as a first-choice drug because of limited supply and the increasing resistance of pneumococci to penicillin [20] , whereas in Finland, 95% of pneumococcal strains remain sensitive to penicillin [22] . Our patients received only 1-2 days of parenteral treatment, after which they were successfully switched to oral treatment. Earlier studies have shown that the majority of children with CAP can be treated as outpatients after one injection of cephalosporin [8] .",
