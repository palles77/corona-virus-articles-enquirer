In the present study this tentative marker of recurrent infections was used to study the pathogenetic background of otitis media with effusion (OME). Altogether 57 consecutive children, aged 2-11 years, who came for tympanostomy and/or adenoidectomy were divided into three subgroups: 25 of them had OME and a history of recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM/OME + ), 20 had OME without an infectious background (inf -/OME + ), and 12 had a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections (inf + /OME -) without OME. All the children were free of acute illness at the time of sampling. Differences between the groups were seen in IFN yields when leukocyte cultures were stimulated with adeno-, rhino-, corona-, respiratory syncytial or influenza A viruses. Leukocytes from inf -/OME + children produced more IFN than those of the other two groups. Though no sex differences in the IFN responses were seen among rAOM/OME + and inf + /OME -children, leukocytes from inf -/OME + girls produced significantly higher amounts of IFN than those of inf -/OME + boys, or rAOM/OME + and inf + /OME -children. These differences between clinically different groups of children support the view that the etiology of OME can be heterogeneous.",

A number of clinical studies suggest an association between OME and upper respiratory tract infections [7, 12] . However, all patients do not have a clear history of respiratory tract infections or otitis media [5, 11, 15] , and it has been suggested that OME is not a single clinical entity [S] . On the other hand, it has also been difficult to evaluate the significance of the different infection-related and other pathogenetic factors in OME. While laboratory studies on the pathogenesis or classification of OME have mainly been based on the analyses or characteristics of the middle ear effusion and middle ear mucosa, also more general immunologic factors may contribute to the genesis of OME [21, 24] . We have previously shown that leukocytes from children prone to respiratory tract infections have a deficiency in their IFN production capacity when exposed in vitro to pathogenic viruses [18] . It is not yet clear, whether the deficiency is a marker of a genetic trend to increased susceptibility to respiratory infections or is secondary to frequent infections. Anyhow, it may serve as a marker for a recent history of recurrent infections. In the present study we investigated whether children suffering from OME with or without a history of recurrent acute otitis media differ with respect to the capacity of their leukocytes to produce virus-induced IFN.",

In this study the OME children were subdivided into a group (N = 20) with an asymptomatic incidentally discovered OME but without an apparent infectious background that is otitis or other respiratory tract infections only occasionally or not at all (inf -/OME + ) and into a group (N= 25) with known recurrent attacks of acute otitis media (rAOM/OME +), Table 1 shows the age and sex distribution of these 57 children. The diagnosis of these children was based on the patients history, pneumatic otoscopy and otomicroscopy. The criteria for diagnosing OME includes the presence of effusion in pneumatic otoscopy, and confirmed in tympanostomy, behind an intact eardrum without sign and symptoms of acute infection. The definition of AOM was that a child had findings suggesting middle ear effusion, and at least one of the following symptoms: otalgia, tugging at or rubbing of the ear, rectal or axillary temperature of at least 38.O\"C, irritability, restless sleep, acute gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting or diarrhea) or other simultaneous respiratory infection. The criteria of rAOM/OME + group were that a child had had at least 4 AOM episodes during the last 6 months. To be included in the inf + /OME -group a child had to have experienced at least 6 episodes of upper respiratory tract infection during the last 6 months. Such infections included rhinitis, pharyngitis or tonsillitis, occasionally combined with sinusitis or otitis, but without any other complications. The infections were mostly accompanied by a moderate fever. Otherwise all the children were healthy and had grown normally. All the children with known allergy or other diseases were excluded. The patients were enrolled in the study after an informed consent of the parents. In all patients the serum levels of immunoglobulins and complement components were measured by immunoturbidometric methods, and none of the children showed any noticeable immunological aberrations. The children had been healthy for at least one week since the last infection. Blood specimens for leukocyte preparation were drawn using the needle inserted for injecting intravenous anaesthetics, but immediately before that.",

A calibrated leukocyte IFN standard (a gift from Dr. Kari Cantell, National Public Health Institute, Helsinki) was included in all assays so that the results could be given in international units (IU). The results given are means of 2 parallel cultures, a maximum of a 2-fold difference was seen between the parallel specimens. A constant donor-specific pattern in the IFN responses has been seen [17] . The subtype of IFN was not specifically assessed in these studies.

            "text": "Etiologic factors that initiate the pathogenetic process leading to otitis media can be summarised by the term multifactorial. Genetic factors are becoming more important, and are likely to contribute to the anatomy and function of the Eustachian tube and the middle ear cleft, and to immune functions. Though viral infections are commonly associated with recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTI) and often provoke recurrent acute otitis media [1, 20] , and may lead to OME, the hypothesis that OME in children is always a manifestation of recurrent or chronic catarrhal infection of the upper respiratory tract has not been proven. Clinically, the course and background of OME varies greatly, and it can be subdivided into a postinfectious (history of rAOM) and a silent (no history of rAOM) form [l 11. However the pathologic events and changes seen in OME often occur as a continuum of events progressing through acute and subacute stages to a chronic phase. Interferons are considered major factors in the host defence against viral infections in humans. The IFN system is essential for antiviral defence, as has been shown by mice lacking the type I IFN receptor [14] . Our study demonstrated an overall difference in the IFN system between the two types of OME showing that virus-induced IFN production by cultured leukocytes from OME children without an apparent infectious background (inf -/OME + ) can differ from that of OME children with a preceding recurrent AOM. Unfortunately healthy children were not included in this study, but we have previously shown that their leukocytes produce more IFN in vitro than those of rAOM and RRTI children [18] . Though we cannot yet be certain, if a deficiency in IFN production is a genetic or acquired property in these children, it anyhow seems to be a marker of both rAOM and RRTI. In accordance with this, OME children of the rAOM group showed in this study this marker but those without a history of recurrent infections did not show it as a group. While we did not determine the type of IFN produced, it is highly likely that most of the IFN measured was IFN-c( since virus-induced leukocyte IFN is mostly a mixture of different c( IFNs. Significantly increased IFN-7 production induced by Concanavalin A has been reported in OME children compared to normal controls 131.",

This finding is difficult to explain. Boys have a significantly higher risk for developing OME and rAOM than girls [9, 19, 22] . This does not, however, explain the differences in IFN production between the inf -/OME + children since no systematic difference between the sexes was seen among rAOM/OME + and inf + /OMEchildren. The independence of IFN production from sex among rAOM/OME + and inf + /OME -children is in accordance with previous reports [3, 18] . Boys with inf -/OME + did not significantly differ from boys with rAOM/OME + or inf + /OME -in IFN production although a trend towards a difference was seen for some of the viruses used. However, because of the small numbers of children far-reaching conclusions based on these findings could not be drawn. Maybe the findings only reflect the fact that infections in general are rarer in young girls than in boys and that IFN production by leukocytes may be one-factor contributing to this difference.",

A large number of studies have shown an age dependence of rAOM and RRTI [19, 23] , and also OME with a background of infections seems to concentrate on younger age groups [l l] though it is well established that several immunologic phenomena depend on the subject's age [10, 21] , the age within the ranges met in this study, probably does not affect the IFN production [6, 18] .",
