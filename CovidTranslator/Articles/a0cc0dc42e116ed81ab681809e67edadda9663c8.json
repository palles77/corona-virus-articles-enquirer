Whereas N-7 methylation is essential for RNA translation and stability 1, the function of 2\u2032-O methylation has remained uncertain since its discovery 35 years ago 2-4. Here, we show that a West Nile virus (WNV) mutant (E218A) that lacks 2\u2032-O MTase activity was attenuated in wild type primary cells and mice but was pathogenic in the absence of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. 2\u2032-O methylation of viral RNA did not affect IFN induction in WNVinfected fibroblasts but instead modulated the antiviral effects of IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT), which are interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) implicated in regulation of protein translation.

Differential methylation of cytoplasmic RNA likely serves as a paradigm for pattern recognition and restriction of propagation of foreign viral RNA in host cells.",

Many viral mRNA also contain Cap 1 and 2 structures, but cap acquisition occurs distinctly among virus families 2,6. RNA and DNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm cannot use the host nuclear capping machinery, and thus, have evolved MTases to facilitate N-7 and 2\u2032-O capping or mechanisms to \"snatch\" the cap from host cell mRNA 1.

            "text": "Since dissemination of WNV-E218A was aborted in vivo we assessed whether 2\u2032-O methylation restricted the protective IFN-induced immune response. IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/mice infected with WNV-WT showed 100% mortality and a mean time to death (MTD) of 3.5 days, as seen previously 9 (Fig 1a) . Remarkably, IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/mice infected with the WNV-E218A exhibited a similar phenotype with only a slightly delayed MTD of 4.5 days. IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/mice infected with WNV-E218A at day 3 sustained tissue titers that approached those of WNV-WT (Fig 1d) . Thus, 2\u2032-O methylation of WNV RNA is required for virulence in vivo, and its absence renders a virus sensitive to the IFN response. Viral growth analysis in primary mouse fibroblasts (MEF) and macrophages (M\u03d5), which both produce and respond to type I IFN after WNV infection 10, confirmed attenuation of WNV-E218A in wild type cells (50-fold lower and 151-fold lower at 72 h, P < 0.05, n = 3 in MEF and M\u03d5, respectively) and restored growth in IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/cells (Fig 1e and f) . Replication of WNV-E218A also was rescued in IRF-3 -/-, IRF-3 -/-\u00d7 IRF-7 -/-, or IPS-1 -/cells that have altered or abolished IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 responses 11 ( Supplementary Fig 2a- c and 3a-d, respectively), but not in IRF-7 -/or TLR3 -/cells, which have normal IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b2 responses after WNV infection, respectively 10,12 ( Supplementary Fig 2d-e) . These experiments confirmed that rescue of WNV-E218A in primary cells requires attenuation of the IFN response.",

However, direct binding assays with recombinant RIG-I and 2\u2032-O unmethylated or methylated WNV RNA (5\u2032 untranslated region) showed no change in binding ( Supplementary Fig 4) . It remained possible that 2\u2032-O methylation of WNV RNA affected other proteins required for transcriptional activation of the IFN-\u03b2 gene. To evaluate this idea, IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/-MEF, which produce IFN-\u03b2 without responding to it, were infected at a high MOI and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was measured. Notably, both WNV-WT and WNV-E218A stimulated IFN-\u03b2 transcription equivalently after infection (Fig 2a) . Thus, a lack of 2\u2032-O methylation does not affect pathogen sensing or IFN induction. To address whether 2\u2032-O methylation of viral RNA serves to antagonize or evade IFN effector functions, IPS-1 -/-MEF, which do not produce type I IFN after WNV infection but can respond to it 11, were exposed to IFN-\u03b2 to induce ISG, and then infected. WNV-E218A displayed increased sensitivity to IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment when compared to WNV-WT (2,400,000 and 20,000-fold inhibition with 500 IU/ml of IFN-\u03b2, respectively) (Fig 2b) .",

To assess whether differential 2\u2032-O methylation of viral RNA might affect suppression by IFIT-1 and/or IFIT-2, we evaluated infection in 3T3 MEF expressing a murine IFIT-1 or IFIT-2 transgene. As observed in primary cells, WNV-E218A replication in control 3T3 cells was reduced (\u223c5 to 60-fold-decrease at 24-72 h, P < 0.05, n = 3) compared to WNV-WT, confirming that 2\u2032-O methylation is required for optimal infectivity (Fig 3a) . Transgenic expression of IFIT-2 reduced infection of WNV-WT (\u223c56 to 100-fold decrease at 24-72 h, P < 0.0005, n = 3) (Fig 3b) when compared to replication in 3T3-GFP cells.

Expression of IFIT-1 in 3T3 cells had minimal inhibitory effects on WNV infection (Fig 3c) . To confirm the linkage between IFIT-2 expression and restriction of infection, siRNA knockdown experiments were performed. Transfection of a sequence-specific siRNA that reduced protein expression of IFIT-2 enhanced replication of WNV-E218A (P < 0.01, n = 3) (Fig 3d) . These experiments demonstrate that mouse IFIT-2 is an antiviral effector of IFN actions, whose inhibitory activity is minimized by 2\u2032-O methylation of viral RNA.",
