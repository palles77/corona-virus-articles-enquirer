Eventually, the fall in incidence leads to a fall in prevalence because infections are 'lost' from the population (due to recovery, death or emigration) faster than they are replaced by the spreading of infection. In the longer term, the infectious agent may be able to persist in the population (i.e. become endemic) if there is a high-enough rate of resupply of susceptible individuals due to birth, immigration, recovery from infection (if there is no lasting immunity) or waning of immunity (if applicable); otherwise the infectious agent will go extinct locally. These population-level effects have important consequences. For example, vaccinating individuals or treating infectious individuals benefits not only the individual patient directly but also benefits others in the population indirectly by reducing their risk of acquiring infection through the reduction in the prevalence of infection in the population. (Quarantine and isolation typically benefit the population more than the affected individuals.) Vaccination against pneumococcus caused the incidence of infection with 'vaccine' serotypes to fall in those who did not receive the vaccine because they were older than the target group for vaccination, as well as in those who were vaccinated. 17 It is important that economic evaluation of potential interventions takes account of infections averted, which benefits health and saves money by averting the need for treatment, by using mathematical models. 8, 14 Insights from Transmission-Dynamic Modeling Importantly, population-level effects due to infectious disease transmission dynamics mean there is typically a complex nonlinear relationship between the size of an intervention and the outcome.",

Vaccinating just a small proportion of the population mostly benefits only those who receive the vaccine because it does little to interrupt transmission. Vaccinating a large-enough proportion of the population to achieve 'herd immunity' prevents epidemics, providing a large 'indirect' benefit to those not vaccinated. Another example is in the control of curable infections (e.g. STIs) through treatment: if treatment capacity is inadequate then there is a 'vicious circle' where failing to control transmission in the present results in more infections in the future, maintaining the inadequacy of treatment capacity. 6 Conversely, making a concerted effort to increase capacity can break this vicious circle and create a virtuous circle, where promptly treating a large-enough proportion of infections reduces transmission, reducing the need for treatment, leading to significant cost savings. 6 However, 'indirect' population-level effects can also be harmful. 18 Whilst reducing levels of infection in the population through vaccination protects those who are not vaccinated as well as those who are vaccinated by reducing the overall rate of infection, those who do still get infected are older on average when they get infected and this can lead to more severe outcomes for some diseases (e.g. congenital rubella syndrome). Therefore, vaccination can increase the overall rate of disease -either transiently, until infection is eliminated from the population, if there is high-enough coverage -or indefinitely, if vaccine coverage is persistently low. 18 Mathematical models can help predict these effects and aid the design of strategies to mitigate them, e.g. ensuring sufficient vaccination coverage and identifying the at-risk age range.",

No single behavior change was sufficient to account for the observed reduction. 15 Models can help set priorities for empirical research by determining the importance of different 'gaps' in knowledge. This is done by testing the 'sensitivity' of a model's behavior to changes in the values of parameters that are poorly estimated by current data to see how much they affect predicted levels of disease or the predicted effectiveness of different interventions.

A related quantity is the basic reproduction number R 0 , 18 which is defined as the mean number of new infections caused by a typical infected individual in a population of wholly susceptible individuals, i.e. R 0 is what the value of R(t) would be if the population were totally-susceptible. It is important to understand that R(t) is specific to the particular infectious agent in the particular population at the particular time, and can be changed by interventions. R(t) depends upon the average rate of transmission from an infectious individual and the average duration of infectiousness. An epidemic requires that R(t)>1, so that the prevalence of infection increases because more than one new infection arises from the average infected person before that person is 'lost' from the infected population. In the typical epidemic described above, depletion of the 'supply' of susceptible individuals causes R(t) to fall, even though R 0 does not change. In fact, R(t) falls even as incidence rises; the initial increase in incidence is driven by the increase in prevalence, with the proportionate increase in prevalence being greater than the proportionate reduction in transmission from the average prevalent case, caused by the reduction in the number who remain susceptible.",

The model consists of a set of differential equations describing the rates that individuals flow between different compartments as they become infected, recover, die (not applicable here), etc. The net rate of change in X(t) is or promoting condom use and reductions in numbers of sexual partners to combat STIs) or using vaccination or prophylaxis to 'remove' people from the susceptible population. Generally, the higher the value of R 0 , the harder an infection will be to control. In a homogeneous population (one where everyone has the same average risk of acquiring and transmitting infection) the relationship between R 0 and R(t) is R(t) = R 0 \u00d7s where s is the proportion of the population that is susceptible. To prevent an epidemic by vaccination requires that s be reduced so that R(t) <1 (i.e. that s be reduced below 1/R 0 ), hence the greater the value of R 0 the smaller s must be. The critical vaccination threshold is the proportion of the population that must be successfully immunized to prevent an epidemic; for childhood infections such as measles, which have high typical R 0 values, this is typically >90% or even >95%.",

SARS spread quickly from China to other parts of Asia, Europe, the Americas and elsewhere, infecting >8000 individuals in 29 countries and killing at least 774 people. Transmission was linked to close contact with cases, mostly in hospital, affecting healthcare workers or patients. 3, 30 Models of SARS transmission provided estimates of the key epidemiological parameters and showed how spreading was controlled by effective intervention. Reproduction number estimates from before the WHO global alert, for Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore and Canada, respectively, were 3.6, 2.4, 3.1 and 2.7, and after were 0.7, 0.3, 0.7 and 1. 31 The reduction in the reproductive number in each country reflects the effectiveness of control measures such as quarantine and travel restrictions in curbing the epidemic.",

The generation time for influenza (4-6 days) is much shorter than for SARS (8-12 days), 3,16 meaning influenza will spread much quicker. Furthermore, SARS transmission occurs after the patient becomes symptomatic 16 making it feasible to use isolation to reduce transmission -whilst influenza can be transmitted in the absence of symptoms.",
