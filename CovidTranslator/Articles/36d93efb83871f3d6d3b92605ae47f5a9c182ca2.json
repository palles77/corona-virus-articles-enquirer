A wide variety of exotic flora and fauna have since been introduced, and major changes to the landscape and ecology have occurred, particularly once European settlers arrived 150 years ago. However, large areas of New Zealand that are representative of a prehuman state still remain, in particular offshore, islands such as Whenua hou (Codfish Island), which is situated off the southern coast of New Zealand. Before human settlement, only 3 species of terrestrial mammals were present, all of which were bats. Why nonvolant mammals have been absent is unknown, but this absence was probably caused by major extinction events and subsequent geographic isolation that prevented recolonization (2, 3) .",

Apart from humans, only 2 other terrestrial mammals have ever inhabited Whenua hou: the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans), both of which were eliminated from the island in the late 1980s (11); neither mammal has been reported as a host of alphacoronaviruses.

Given detection of this coronavirus, more thorough characterization of the ecology of viruses and other microorganisms in native wildlife should be considered to fulfill conservation needs and further safeguard human and domestic animal health against cross-species transmission.",
