Pneumonia continues to be the number one cause of under 5 death despite effective treatments (Wardlaw et al., 2006) . A substantial contributor to this is the largely unknown etiology of most pneumoniae, with both viral and bacterial origin. The patterns of pneumonia and other ARI hospitalizations serves as a proxy for determining the transmission dynamics of viruses and bacteria contributing to these hospitalizations, and is of key importance in understanding and limiting burden of this childhood killer.",

Identification of low incidence seasons would provide a target window for vaccination, with the hope of maximizing population immunity before the onset of the influenza season. Similarly, when respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination becomes available, knowledge of its seasonality will be useful to maximize benefit (Drysdale et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2013) , and in the potential administration of passive immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab to reduce the number of severe outcomes associated with RSV infection among high-risk infants (Committee on Infectious Diseases, 2009 ). Finally, knowledge of seasonal patterns of virus circulation can inform the clinical use of antibiotics, again limiting use when viral circulation is traditionally high to minimize antibiotic resistance ( Van Nguyen et al., 2013; Laxminarayan et al., 2013 Laxminarayan et al., , 2016 Van Boeckel et al., 2014) .",

Information on viral transmission dynamics across seasons in Vietnam is relatively under-explored. Do et al. found seasonality of RSV infections and slight seasonality of HMPV infections in Ho Chi Minh City, but no seasonality of influenza (Do et al., 2011) . Several studies have similarly found high variability in Influenza A & B incidence over the year (Nguyen et al., 2007; Le et al., 2015; Thai et al., 2015) . Yoshida et al. found RSV occurring in the hot months, influenza A in the cool months, and year-round detection of HRV in Nha Trang (Yoshida et al., 2010) .

The hospital based enhanced surveillance of childhood ARI is ongoing. We analyze data from January 29, 2007 to April 26, 2012 which is the only tertiary care facility located in Khanh Hoa Province. According to the field site census survey in July 2006, the study catchment area encompassing the 16 non-touristic of the 27 communes in Nha Trang city, had 198,729 residents including 13,952 children less than 5 years of age. An ARI case was defined as any child presenting to KHGH with cough or/and difficulty in breathing. Before study enrollment, informed consent was obtained from parents of children who presented with ARI and lived in the study catchment area. Clinical and demographic information, chest radiographs (CXR), laboratory data, and nasopharyngeal (NP) samples were collected from all enrolled patients. KHGH is the only hospital in Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa province and the only one accessible for residents of the catchment area. Hence for incidence calculations we assume that all children with ARI are eligible to be hospitalized and enrolled into the study and use the population of the catchment area as denominator. Acute respiratory infection patients with normal CXR were categorized as upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Patients with abnormal CXR were categorized as lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI).",

We excluded hospitalizations with more than one virus detected in the nasopharynx to adjust for a potential bias through inclusion of cases who by virtue of being co-infected may otherwise have been asymptomatic (Althouse and Scarpino, 2015) . This approach underestimates the true incidence of NP carriage among ARI cases but allows estimation of seasonal patterns that are not biased by other circulating viruses; although co-circulation of bacteria was not accounted for.

The cross-wavelet transform identifies regions of high power in phase-space and identifies the relative phases of each time series, i.e., in-phase or out-of-phase (Grinsted et al., 2004) . The wavelet transform can be thought of a Fourier transformation over time that can identify what is the dominant frequency composing a time series as the signal changes in time. The cross-wavelet transform allows us to compare how two time signals co-vary: we can identify if the presence of a particular frequency at a given time in the time series of hospitalizations corresponds to the presence of that same frequency at the same time in a weather covariate (Chaves and Pascual, 2006) . Additionally, we can identify the magnitude by which weather precedes or follows hospitalizations through the phase angle of the two time series. Finally, we can identify the statistical significance of the identified constituent frequencies over time by comparing the observed frequencies to a red-noise process.",

Monthly average rainfall (in inches), temperature (1 F), and dew point (1 F) correlated with the seasonality of some of our endpoints. Figure 4 shows the incidence rate ratios for the three weather effects from the seasonally-adjusted models. Overall hospitalizations for ARI were negatively associated with temperature (IRR 0.92 per 1 degree increase, 95% CI: 0.87, 0.97, p = 0.003) and positively associated with dew point (IRR 1.08 per 1 degree increase, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.13, p < 0.001). Of the few other significant effects, Influenza A and HRV had a negative associations with temperature (IRR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.9, p = 0.0116, and IRR 0.86, 95% CI: 0.79, 0.94, p < 0.001, respectively), and HPIV3 and HRV were positively associated with dew point, with IRRs 1.26 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.52, p = 0.0164) and 1.13 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.21, p = 0.0009), respectively. Logistic regression found that RSV was positively associated with the previous week's rain, with an odds ratio of of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.21, 2.99, p = 0.0053). Previous week's temperature was marginally associated with RSV (OR: 1.14 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.33, p = 0.08) (see supplementary material). Figure 5 shows the cross-wavelet transform of all hospitalizations and the three weather variables in the month of admission. Significant bands of high power around 1 year can be seen for temperature and dew point. This indicates that hospitalizations and temperature and dew point share variability at yearly frequencies over the study period, and the phase relationship indicates that changes in weather slightly precede changes in hospitalizations (arrows point about 45 down). Figure 6 shows the cross-wavelet transform of RSV and the three weather variables with similar significance bands around 1 year for temperature and dew point. The phase indicates temperature and dew point lead RSV incidence. While not significant, RSV was found to be leading rainfall by 90 (3 months) at the one year period band (see supplementary material). Significant bands of power were seen between temperature and dew point with HPIV3 with an indicated phase relationship of nearly completely out-of-phase (Figure 7) . Similar patterns were seen (1 year significant bands between temperature and dew point and virus) for ADV, HBoV, CoV, HPIV1,2&4, HRV, and influenza A, though the phase differences varied across these viruses; HMPV and influenza B had bands lying outside the cone of influence (ie, not statistically significant; see supplementary material). These results in general indicate strong associations between weather covariates and viral hospitalizations at a yearly timescale. ",

By fitting a series of statistical models to the observed data, we allow the data to identify salient features contributing to the seasonality of these viruses. We evaluated seasonal patterns and associations with weather of hospitalizations for several respiratory viruses using three lines of evidence: 1) Poisson regression examining the relative incidence across months of virus detections adjusted for weather covariates, 2) cross-wavelet transforms of hospitalizations with viral detections, and 3) a sensitivity analysis with a logistic regression model finding odds ratio of hospitalizations with viral detections and weather variables. Any viral detection showed distinct seasonality with peaks in May through September, a negative association with temperature, positive association with dew point, and crosswavelets indicating temperature and dew point leading viral detection. Of commonly detected viruses, RSV, Influenza A, and HPIV3 had significant seasonality. RSV peaked in July through December, was positively associated with the week's previous average rainfall. Cross-wavelets showed temperature and dew point to lead RSV, rain was found to non-significantly fall behind RSV at 1 year frequencies, and precede RSV at shorter (<100 day) frequencies. Finally, HPIV3 while not significant, had peaks in January and February, was positively associated with dew point, and was completely out of phase with temperature and dew points in cross-wavelet analyses. These results contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens in South East Asia and Southern Central Vietnam.",

This seasonality is opposite to observed seasonality in temperate climates, where RSV typically peaks in winter (Tang and Loh, 2014; Shek and Lee, 2003) . Recent reviews of RSV seasonality in tropical regions highlights the uncertainty in the effects of weather on RSV transmission. Studies in Brazil (Straliotto et al., 2002) , Hawaii (Reese and Marchette, 1991) , India (Agrawal et al., 2009) , Kenya (Hazlett et al., 1988) , and Malaysia (Chew et al., 1998; Chan et al., 2002; Khor et al., 2012) , have shown negative associations between temperature and RSV, while studies in Hong Kong (Chan et al., 1999) , Mexico (Yusuf et al., 2007) , Singapore (Chew et al., 1998) , and Taiwan (Huang et al., 2001) have shown positive associations. We find strongly positive associations between temperature and RSV hospitalizations with a slight lead of temperature on RSV. This is evident both from the cross-wavelet transform and the regression results indicating a positive effect of the previous week's temperature on RSV.",

We find similar associations, with the mean rainfall and temperature over the previous 7 days having odds ratios for RSV of 1.90 and 1.14, respectively. This association is plausible as the incubation period of RSV is estimated to be between 4 and 5 days (Lessler et al., 2009) .

First, while we have nearly 6 years of data, this is still a relatively short period to assess longterm seasonal trends, or to increase confidence in the estimates of seasonal patterns. However, the length of the analyzed time series is similar to other studies examining seasonal trends in viral respiratory pathogens in the tropics (Chew et al., 1998; Hall, 2001) , and gives indications for areas of future study. Second, we excluded individuals with more than one virus detected. Examination of changes in the seasonality of other viruses and coinfection over this period is worthy of study and is outside the scope of this paper. Third, this study used hospital-based surveillance, necessarily presenting the most ill children. We take as an assumption that hospitalizations are a fraction of all transmission and severity of illness is not related to weather. Finally, this study examines the influence of weather on viral hospitalizations and does not address other drivers of seasonal patterns of transmission, such as school closures (Fine and Clarkson, 1982) , differences in other social behavior such as contact rates (Cook et al., 1990; Dushoff et al., 2004) , susceptible recruitment through births (Metcalf et al., 2012) , or possible seasonal changes in host immune responses (Dowell et al., 2003) .

Similarly, knowing RSV peaks in the late summer/early fall when RCP is at its lowest may help in limiting unnecessary antibiotic (Laxminarayan and Malani, 2007) or antiviral use (Tanaka et al., 2014) .
