Limited information exists on the virology of ARI in LTCFs, where virological testing is reactive. We report on findings of a surveillance feasibility substudy from a larger prospective trial of introducing rapid influenza diagnostic testing (RIDT) at 10 Wisconsin LTCFs. Any resident with symptoms consistent with ARI had a nasal swab specimen collected for RIDT by staff. Following RIDT, the residual swab was placed into viral transport medium and tested for influenza using Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and for 20 pathogens using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction respiratory pathogen panel. Numbers of viruses in each of 7 categories (influenza A, influenza B, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus) across the 3 years were compared using c 2 .

The distribution of viruses varied significantly across the 3 years (c 2 \u00bc 71.663; df \u00bc 12; P < .001).

LTCF residents experience this high burden of respiratory infections, often with significant morbidity and mortality, owing to 3 attributes: high transmissibility of many respiratory viruses, close quartering of residents, and high morbidity and mortality in this population. 6 For example, influenza attack rates of 7.2% to 27% are common in LTCFs and have been associated with mortality rates of 4.4% to 5.2%. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The Rapid Assessment of and Prophylaxis for Influenza in Dwellers of Long-Term Care Facilities (RAPID-LTCF) study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02964871) is a randomized controlled trial with the primary objective to evaluate the potential benefits of using rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) in LTCFs. Nursing staff-initiated testing 12 is triggered by the appearance of acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms and entails collection of a nasal swab specimen for on-site testing. The premise for this feasibility substudy is that nasal swab specimens, collected for point-of-care RIDT testing, in the intervention arm of the study, can be easily repurposed for respiratory virus surveillance within LCTFs. Such an approach would allow for onsite and near real-time diagnosis with RIDT, with the ability to use the residual specimen for broader surveillance efforts. Accordingly, we examined (1) the rate at which residual specimens are sent for expanded testing; (2) the rate of respiratory virus detection from residual specimens; and (3) whether resident characteristics contribute to the detection rate.",

We were unable to detect declines in the rate of virus detection with increasing age or with increasing time from symptom onset. Accordingly, using \"low threshold\" criteria of ARI symptoms to trigger sampling and testing in the absence of a known influenza outbreak (eg, new onset ARI symptoms), as opposed to established criteria (eg, \"When an influenza outbreak has been identified in a long-term care facility or hospital, influenza testing should be done for any resident/ patient with one or more acute respiratory symptoms, with or without fever.\"), 19 holds the potential for early detection and characterization of a number of circulating respiratory viruses.",

First, this assessment is part of a larger study evaluating the potential benefit of RIDT use in LTCF for early identification of influenza. The subsequent handling and transfer of nasal swabs was a secondary outcome, as RAPID-LTCF was not designed to be an epidemiologic assessment of respiratory viruses in such locations. Nevertheless, as the 10 study sites were randomly selected from a pool of 20 sites and had a wide geographic distribution, we do have a generalizable sampling frame. Second, we did not evaluate compliance of individual sites. In each of the first 2 years, personnel at 9 sites collected specimens; this dropped to 8 sites in the third year. The third year, however, was marked by a very late influenza season and manifested lower levels of respiratory virus activity across Wisconsin as evidenced by a 14% decline in ARI cases for patients !65 years of age recorded in electronic health record monitoring of Wisconsin surveillance clinics. 1 Moreover, because of early autumn training and staff turnover, late season testing may be vulnerable to attrition in trained nursing staff. Third, other factors may have created interference with specimen transport. The WSLH changed couriers following the first year; the decline in the number of specimens that were transferred to WSLH for RT-PCR and RPP in the second 2 years was attributable, in part, to courier issues. Fourth, the RPP used in this study had a limited number of pathogens. Accordingly, the rate of virus identification may have been limited by the array of pathogens. The overall rate of virus detection, however, was similar to that found in our other surveillance systems using the same laboratory testing 1 as well as in studies designed primarily to assess the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in LTCF settings. 17, 18 Fifth, we were unable to couple virus identification with clinical outcomes. Consequently, we do not know if there was selection bias in nurse identification of residents for testing. Finally, our study sites were distributed statewide, but were limited to less than 3% of Wisconsin's LTCFs.",

The use of nasal swab specimens, obtained for on-site rapid influenza testing, was associated with a relatively high rate of respiratory virus identification by subsequent influenza RT-PCR and RPP. Detection of respiratory viruses was not significantly affected by resident age or time from symptom onset (up through 4 days). This approach demonstrated a wide variety of viruses and significant variability from year to year. Despite this variability, however, 4 viruses with high potential for morbidity and mortality in LTCF settings were found in nearly 70% of ARI cases. On-site testing of nasal swab specimensdcollected on-site from residents with ARI by nursing staffdwith additional virological testing off-site may not only provide a useful alternative for both respiratory virus diagnostic and surveillance efforts, but may ultimately provide useful information for infection control efforts and justification for prophylactic treatment of LTCF resident populations. This approach is consistent with and enhances existing guidelines that call for collection of specimens early in illness, appropriate testing as soon as possible, and reporting of results to public health and the originating facility. 1 ",
