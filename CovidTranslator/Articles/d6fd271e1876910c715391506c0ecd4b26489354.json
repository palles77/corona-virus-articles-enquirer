In this study, a source (i.e. a patient who generates droplets) and a receiver (i.e. a susceptible object other than the source) are modeled in a mechanically ventilated room. The receiver's exposure to the droplet nuclei is analyzed under two orientations relative to the source. Two droplet nuclei, 0.1 and 10 m, with different emission velocities, are selected to represent large expiratory droplets which can still be inhaled into the human respiratory tracts. The droplet dispersion and mixing characteristics under well-mixed and displacement ventilation schemes are evaluated and compared numerically. Results show that the droplet dispersion and mixing under displacement ventilation is consistently poorer. Very low concentration regions are also observed in the displacement scheme. For both ventilation schemes, the intake dose will be reduced substantially if the droplets are emitted under the face-to-wall orientation rather than the face-to-face orientation. Implications of using engineering strategies for reducing exposure are briefly discussed.",

The dried droplets are called droplet nuclei and are responsible for human-to-human transmission of the airborne infectious pathogens. Although the exact mechanism underlying droplet nuclei infection is not fully understood, it is known that the first step in a series of dose-response relations leading to the infection is the regional deposition of inhaled particles in the lung. Generally speaking, the intake dose (or called the exposure dose) is a function of both temporal and spatial droplet nuclei concentration which depends on the physical characteristics of the nuclei such as droplet sizes and airflow patterns, as well as many environmental factors including relative source-to-receiver locations.",

            "text": "Airflow pattern is the most significant parameter influencing the droplet transport in indoor environments [4, [10] [11] [12] [13] . The choice of ventilation scheme controls the global airflow pattern and thus the ultimate distribution of pollutants. There are two ventilation schemes being widely used in commercial offices, viz. the conventional well-mixed (or ceiling supply and return) ventilation-high velocity cooled air is delivered through high ceiling/side wall supply diffusers, and the displacement ventilation-low momentum cooled air is supplied to the lower part of the space [14] [15] . For both of these schemes, the exhausts are normally located on the high ceilings. A recent study has shown that the uni-directional upward ventilation system is more efficient in removing small droplets while the single floor system is more efficient in removing large droplets [16] . Expiratory droplets can be classified as coarse and fine aerosols. Coarse aerosols do not become truly airborne as they settle onto the floor rapidly after emission, whereas fine aerosols remain airborne for a prolonged period because of their low settling velocity and lead to a high potential for long-range infections [17] . Preliminary studies show that droplet size is one key factor affecting the spread of droplet nuclei. An updated review has summarized three past studies (spanned over the last five decades) on the sizes of particles emitted during coughing or sneezing [6] . It has been reported that for droplets less than 50 m, the dispersion feature is dominant due to the very short evaporation time [18, 19] . Hence, in this work, evaporating was not considered and two droplet nuclei sizes, 0.01 and 10 m, corresponding to fine and coarse nuclei for viral and bacteria infections, respectively, were chosen. Another key factor is the droplet emission velocity. Reportedly, the initial emission velocity can be up to 100 m/s [20] . A recent study on coughed airflows of healthy males showed that the emission velocity was in the range of 6-22 m/s [21] . Based on these results, three velocities namely 20, 50 and 100 m/s were selected for this work. Breathing will also disturb the airflow pattern. However, due to the relatively small airflow volume when breathing, the exhaling process is believed to have little influence on the room airflow pattern [22] . Thus it was not considered in the present work.",

The droplet shape was assumed to be spherical with a density of 1000 kg/m 3 . Simulation times specified for the well-mixed and displacement ventilation schemes were 90 and 240 s, respectively. The displacement scheme required a longer simulation time due to its lower air exchange rate. In either scheme, the droplet concentration decayed to a significantly low level when the specified time was reached and no significant reduction in concentration was found by further increasing the simulation time. A trapped boundary condition was applied for the droplets; once the particle touches any surfaces, it will not resuspend. For the present work, coagulation effect was not taken into account. Fig. 3 . According to these figures it is observed that under the well-mixed scheme a high velocity air jet, approximately equals the supply air whose velocity is 2 m/s, flows above both occupant models and causes a large eddy recirculation in the room. For the displacement scheme, it is noticed that the low velocity cooled air (0.2 m/s) near floor level absorbs heat from the two occupants and creates a dominant vertical thermal plume in the boundary layer around each occupant. The airflow velocity is fairly weak in all regions except at the mid-plane (Fig. 3 ). As will be discussed, this low velocity feature affects the overall droplet dispersion patterns. Fig. 4 shows the concentration profiles at the mid-plane for various emission velocities under the face-to-face orientation. The plots are snapshots at 10 s after emission. Results reveal that there is no significant concentration difference among the three emission velocities in the well-mixed space (c.f. Fig. 4(a)-(c) ).

For the present scenarios, the droplet relaxation time is in the order of 10 \u22124 s which can be neglected. In other words, the droplets decelerate almost instantaneously and that elucidates why the droplets follow the airflow closely-hence the similarity between the airflow and concentration profiles. However, apparent concentration differences can be seen in the displacement ventilated space for various emission velocities. The higher the emission velocity from the source, the greater is the degree of particle impaction around the receiver (c.f. Fig. 4(d)-(f) ). Intuitively, it contradicts with the previous discussion that particles with such a small relaxation time should follow the global airflow pattern closely regardless of the emission velocity. The difference is attributed to the finite emission duration together with low velocity background airflow. For the displacement case, the emission velocity is \"significantly\" higher comparing to the global airflow. This finite and high velocity droplet cloud leads to various impaction patterns around the receiver. If the particles were released instantly, the profiles should not be affected by the emission velocity.",

The (contaminated) vertical thermal plume makes the droplets less likely to disperse within the room. Compared with well-mixed ventilation, displacement ventilation has a much lower average eddy diffusivity (about 1/20 of the well-mixed's). The droplets, largely influenced by buoyant airflow, are less dispersed by the turbulence.

To improve exposure assessment, more accurate predictions on the spatial concentration distribution (or exposure) and the mixing degree are highly desirable. More importantly, engineers can thereby design and implement better control strategies for reducing airborne pollutant concentration.",

In the present work, the sampling points were taken at all of the computational cells; therefore, N is the number of cells. Fig. 9 shows the CVs for both well-mixed and displacement schemes under the face-to-face orientation. In the former scheme, the three emission velocities collapse into a single line and that is consistent with the previous discussion on relaxation time. In the latter scheme, the CV depends on the emission velocity: the higher the emission velocity, the lower the CV (i.e. better mixing). Due to its higher global airflow velocity, as expected, well-mixed ventilation always has a lower (resulting) CV than displacement ventilation. Recent study has also shown that the higher velocity of well-mixed ventilation scheme resulted in faster mixing rate than with the displacement ventilation [37] . Another factor affecting the concentration is droplet deposition. The high airflow rate might also increase the particle deposition onto indoor surfaces [38, 39] but for the particle sizes concerned in the present work, ventilation is still the dominant particle removal mechanisms. Fig. 10 presents the CVs for both face-to-face and face-to-wall orientations under the well-mixed ventilation with an emission Fig. 11 . Comparing Figs. 10 and 11, it can be seen that the CV for the displacement ventilation is almost one order of higher than that for the well-mixed scheme.",

On the contrary, very high concentration gradients will be observed under displacement ventilation. This essential difference between the concentration profiles forms the basis for the implementation of engineering strategies for reducing exposure to airborne particles. Recently, many active devices for the removal of indoor pollutants have been designed and made available commercially. Technologies applied include high efficiency filtration, adsorption onto surfaces, inactivation by UV, and photocatalytic oxidation by titanium oxide. To effectively reduce the pollutants, the device should be installed at the location where high concentration exists. From the present findings, two major inferences can be drawn. First, the location of the active device is not a concern under any well-mixed ventilation schemes. Second, in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal efficacy under any displacement ventilation schemes, the active device should be installed near the exhaust outlet or high ceiling (c.f. Figs.6(a) and (c) and 8(a) and (c)). This can prevent further airborne infection by inactivating the droplets before they (if any) disperse back into the environment.",
