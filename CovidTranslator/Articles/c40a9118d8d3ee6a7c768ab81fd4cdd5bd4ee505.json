Thus, the ANP approach is utilized to solve the evaluation and selection problem. Additionally, this study uses a numerical example to illustrate the steps in the proposed method. Base on results, we conclude that the weights of have a central role when selecting a resort type. The ANP is the generic form of the AHP, and allows for complex interdependent relationships among elements (Saaty, 2001) . The proposed develop analytic network process (ANP) evaluation structure approach generates more informative and accurate results than the conventional ANP for resort type analysis. The ANP-based decision-making approach provides expert decision-makers with a valuable reference for selecting the location for an international resort park type in Taiwan.",

The ANP, which was first developed by Saaty (1980) helps establish decision models for a process containing both qualitative and quantitative components. Qualitatively, ANP decomposes a decision problem from the top overall goal to a set of manageable clusters and sub-clusters, down to the bottom level, which typically contains scenarios or alternatives. The clusters and sub-clusters can be forces, attributes, criteria, activities, or objectives. Quantitatively, ANP uses pair-wise comparisons to assign weights to elements at the cluster and sub-cluster levels, and finally calculates ''global\" weights for assessments at the bottom level. Each pair-wise comparison measures the relative importance or strength of elements within a cluster level using a ratio scale. One of the primary functions of the AHP is to calculate a consistency ratio to determine whether the matrices are appropriate for analysis (Saaty, 1980) . However, AHP models assume that uni-directional relationships exist between elements at different decision levels in a hierarchy and uncorrelated elements within each cluster, as well as between clusters.",

By incorporating interdependencies (i.e., addition of feedback loops in the model), a super-matrix is created. The super-matrix adjusts the relative weights of individual matrices to form a new overall matrix with eigenvectors of the adjusted relative weights (Meade & Sarkis, 1998) . Notably, ANP utilizes a network without needing to specify levels as in a hierarchy. The primary reason for choosing the ANP as the methodology for selecting resort type operations is due to its suitability in offering solutions in a complex multi-criteria decision environment. Fig. 2 presents the structural difference between a hierarchy and network. The elements in a node can influence some or all elements in any other node. A network can have source nodes, intermediate nodes and sink nodes. Relationships in a network are represented by arcs, and the directions of arcs indicate dependence (Saaty, 2001) . Interdependency between two nodes, called outer dependence, is represented by a two-way arrow, and inner dependencies among elements in a node are represented by a looped arc (Sarkis, 2003) . The procedure in the ANP has four principal steps (Meade & Sarkis, 1999; Saaty, 2001) .",

Additionally, when interdependencies exist among elements in a component, pair-wise comparisons must also be performed, and an eigenvector can be derived for each element that indicates the affects of other elements on that element. The relative importance values are determined on a scale of 1-9, where a score of 1 represents equal importance between two elements and a score of 9 indicates extreme importance of one element (row component in the matrix) compared to another element (column component in the matrix) (Meade & Sarkis, 1999) .

An eigenvector can be obtained for a pair-wise comparison matrix of the row components with respect to the column component. This process yields an eigenvector for each column block.

Marketing division (SC 5 ): Traditional seaside resort products are sun, sea and sand. Changing lifestyles, a focus on increasing personal needs, and active travel participation have expanded the notion of value. These have also sparked the growth of all-inclusive packages/ resorts, soft adventure travel, increased numbers of health-related holidays, and an expansion of the concepts of vacation ownership and timesharing. New tourism needs have given rise to major market segments such as the family market and mature travel market and have also changed business travel. 2. Marketing scope (SC 6 ): Marketing scope includes new customers and those displaced through resort competition (improved locations, facilities, standards, prices) and other latent markets whose needs can be serviced (club memberships, convention facilities, and banqueting). 3.

First, the seaside resort have scenic beaches favorable weather conditions, outstanding recreational facilities, or easy accessibility by air or car, unfortunately fall victim to their own excessive popularity and become saturated in terms of development. Examples of saturated resort destinations typically cited by the travel media are Waikiki Beach in Hawaii, Miami Beach in Florida, and the Rivera in Italy and France.

A supermatrix is a partitioned matrix, in which each sub-matrix is composed of vectors obtained from pair-wise comparisons. As discussed in the Appendix and dotted parentheses in Fig. 3 , the supermatrix in this study covers all network elements. Fig. 6 shows the generalized form of the supermatrix. The supermatrix, inserted with respective vectors and matrices obtained prior to before in Table 6 . Because the supermatrix includes interactions between clusters, (e.g. an inter dependence exists among criteria and among sub-criteria), not all columns sums to 1. A weighted supermatrix is transformed first to be stochastic (Table  7) . After entering normalized values into the supermatrix and completing the column stochastic, the supermatrix is then raised to a sufficiently large power until convergence occurs. The current super-matrix reached convergence and attained a unique eigenvector. Table 8 presents the final limit matrix. This limit matrix is column stochastic and represents the final eigenvector. Synthesis, with respect to selection of resort type, obtained the following results, seaside resorts (0.165), lakeside resorts (0.128), casino resorts (0.141) and health/spa resorts (0.111) (Table 8) . Thus, the optimal resort type is seaside resorts. Table 6 The supermatrix Table 7 The weighted supermatrix Table 8 The limit supermatrix",

A case study is also performed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model in selecting among four resort types -seaside resorts, lakeside resorts, casino resorts and health/spa resorts -in which the enters constructs under the construction evaluation pattern. Analytical results suggest that the relative weights changed considerably as the interdependent relationships have a considerable effect on the process model. Finally, by applying the ANP to obtain criteria weight and ranking those results, the seaside resort is the preferred resort type. For the international resort park considered in this case study the four resort types considered are utilized to construct the evaluation model. Analytical results correspond to those for the international resort park. The proposed evaluation method selects resort type for a new international resort park under construction, ensuring that it has competitive advantage once established. This study developed an evaluation criterion for selecting seaside resorts for a new international resort park to be established in Taiwan. Additionally, the proposed evaluation criterion provides policy makers and academics with recommendations for future development.",
