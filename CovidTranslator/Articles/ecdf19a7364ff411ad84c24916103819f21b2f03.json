The clinical presentation can be as cutaneous, inhalational or gastrointestinal forms that are fortuitously not transmissible from person to person. As the October 2001 anthrax cases showed, the insidious nature of anthrax has both a vegetative and spore morphology. The vegetative state, being the growth phase, is typically responsive to most classes of antibiotics, while the spore phase is not. Thus, long treatment modalities with systemic antibiotics for the deadly inhalation form are necessary in order to inhibit all of the organisms that convert from the spore state to the vegetative state [4] .

After inhalation, Bacillus anthracis spores germinate in alveolar macrophages and then migrate to lymph nodes where they propagate. The vegetative bacteria secrete a tripartite toxin, which consists of three proteins: lethal factor (LF, 90 kDa), edema factor (EF, 89 kDa), and protective antigen (PA, 83 kDa), all of which work in concert to kill host cells.

Smallpox is the most feared of all biowarfare pathogens, primarily due to its high transmissibility versus other pathogens whose etiologic affects are episodic (e.g., Y. pestis or M. tuberculosis) [1, 56] . This area has prompted substantial interest in the last several years, especially in the use of vaccinia viruses as surrogates for smallpox. A number of nucleoside analogs were identified that inhibited various stages of viral reproduction by various mechanisms, including (i) inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase inhibitors (EICAR), (ii) S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase inhibitors (5 0 -noraristeromycin, 3-deazaneplanocin A and neplanocin A analogs), (iii) orotidine monophosphate (OMP) decarboxylase inhibitors (pyrazofurin), (iv) cytidine triphosphate (CTP) synthetase inhibitors (cyclopentenyl cytosine), (v) thymidylate synthetase (TS) inhibitors (2 0 -deoxyuridines), (vi) DNA synthetase inhibitors (Ara-A), (vii) acyclic nucleoside (cidofovir), and (viii) polyacrylic acid.",

Further, in some patients, the parenteral formulation shows nephrotoxic events. Lipophosphate prodrugs of cidofovir have been reported to be orally bioavailable [27, 28] . CMX-001 (structure undisclosed) is being studied for the potential treatment of smallpox infections and complications resulting from smallpox vaccination. It is more potent and less toxic than cidofovir. CMX-001 is 100 times more potent than cidofovir, as shown by antiviral assays, and it is active against a variety of pox viruses including smallpox and monkeypox. When given orally, it was fully effective in mouse models of pox virus infection. The development of CMX-001 for smallpox therapy is compelling since earlier clinical data, from the regulatory approval for CMV indications, would facilitate its use for smallpox.",
