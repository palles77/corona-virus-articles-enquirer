Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with MP pneumonia hospitalized between January 2015 and April 2017. Macrolide-unresponsiveness was clinically defined with a persistent fever of \u2265 38.0\u00b0C at \u2265 72 hours after macrolide treatment. The cases were divided into four groups: PMC, CST, DXC, and LFX. We compared the time to defervescence (TTD) after secondary treatment and the TTD after initial macrolide treatment in each group with adjustment using propensity score-matching analysis. Results: Among 1,165 cases of MP pneumonia, 190 (16.3%) were unresponsive to macrolides. The proportion of patients who achieved defervescence within 48 hours in CST, DXC, and LFX groups were 96.9% (31/33), 85.7% (12/14), and 83.3% (5/6), respectively. The TTD after initial macrolide treatment did not differ between PMC and CST groups (5.1 vs. 4.2 days, P = 0.085), PMC and DXC groups (4.9 vs. 5.7 days, P = 0.453), and PMC and LFX groups (4.4 vs. 5.0 days, P = 0.283). No side effects were observed in the CST, DXC, and LFX groups. Conclusion: The change to secondary treatment did not show better efficacy compared to PMC in children with macrolide-unresponsive MP pneumonia. Further studies are needed to guide appropriate treatment in children with MP pneumonia.",

            "text": "Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is one of the most common pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia in children and adolescents. It can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, from mild respiratory symptoms to severe fatal pneumonia with extrapulmonary Given the increase of MRMP, some secondary treatment agents, such as corticosteroids, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones, have been considered for the treatment of MRMP pneumonia, although several studies have suggested that macrolides have clinical efficacy for the treatment of MRMP. [17] [18] [19] Tetracyclines, including minocycline and doxycycline, have been reported as alternative agents for children with MRMP. 20,21 However, they are not recommended for use in patients younger than 8 years of age, because tetracyclines can cause tooth discoloration in children during the periods of osteogenesis and odontogenesis. 22 In addition, fluoroquinolones have been associated with a risk of musculoskeletal toxicities, including tendinitis, arthritis, and growth impairment in children. 23 Although there is still lack of information on their safety in children, it was reported that there were no clinically detectable adverse events for up to 5 years after treatment with levofloxacin (LFX). 24 Some studies have reported the clinical effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids (CST) in the treatment of refractory MP pneumonia, because hyper-reaction of the host immune system may contribute to its pathogenesis. 25, 26 However, CST can also cause several side effects, such as growth disorder, glucose intolerance, and the suppression of the immune system. 27 We aimed to compare the therapeutic efficacy of prolonged macrolides (PMCs), CST, doxycycline (DXC), and LFX against macrolide-unresponsive MP pneumonia in children, and to evaluate the safety of CST, DXC, and LFX.",

We compared the therapeutic efficacy of PMC, CST, DXC, and LFX against macrolide-unresponsive MP pneumonia and collected data about their safety in children. Most of the patient achieved defervescence within 48 hours after the secondary treatment and any side effect was not observed in the CST, DXC, and LFX groups. However, TTD after initial macrolide treatment did not differ significantly between the PMC, CST, DXC, and LFX groups.",

As there was no difference in the clinical manifestation between macrolide-susceptible M. pneumoniae (MSMP) and MRMP, it is difficult to clinically distinguish MRMP from MSMP. However, it has been reported that the duration of fever after the administration of macrolide was longer in MRMP than MSMP in childhood pneumonia and that persistent fever might suggest the possibility of infection with MRMP. The patients with MSMP achieved defervescence within 48-72 hours in more than 80% of cases after treatment with macrolide. 14,15,28 As mycoplasma takes a long time to isolate, antibiotic susceptibility testing is difficult to apply in practical clinical situations. Molecular tests to confirm macrolide resistance are not currently available in Korean hospitals, except in some cases for research purposes. Japanese societies have recommended a change of antibiotics to second-line agents when fever does not subside in 48-72 hours from macrolides administration. 28 In this study, macrolide-unresponsive MP pneumonia was defined as persistent fever of \u2265 38.0\u00b0C at \u2265 72 hours after macrolide treatment.",

Matsubara et al. 19 demonstrated that 22.7% of MRMP cases showed clinical improvement within 3 days after macrolide treatment. In addition, Suzuki et al. 17 reported that fever resolved with the initially prescribed macrolide, without changing antibiotics, for the treatment of MRMP infection, and there was no apparent treatment failure or cases of serious illness. It was suggested that macrolides have anti-inflammatory effects, as well as antimicrobial effects, through the inhibition of the production of cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 in human bronchial epithelial cells. 29, 30 In our data, there were no cases of treatment failure in the PMC group, except for two cases of re-hospitalization. In these two cases, defervescence occurred within 24 hours without a change in antibiotics after rehospitalization.",

Lee et al. 34 reported that 93% of patients with severe MP pneumonia achieved defervescence within 24 hours. In another study, the TTD was approximately 8-48 hours in prednisolone-treated patients. 25 Recently, several studies suggested that tetracycline and fluoroquinolone had a therapeutic effect on MRMP in children. Most patients administered DXC or minocycline achieved defervescence within 24 hours, with a significantly shorter TTD than macrolide in the MRMP group (13.5 \u00b1 4.1 vs. 123.3 \u00b1 59 .0 hours). 21, 35 Miyashita et al. 36 reported that 77% of patients with MRMP in the quinolone group achieved defervescence within 48 hours after the initiation of antibiotics and quinolone was more effective than macrolide for MRMP treatment (P = 0.036). In this study, TTD after DXC and LFX treatment was 27.4 \u00b1 33.2 hours and 16.8 \u00b1 18 .0 hours, respectively. In addition, 85.7% and 83.3% of patients achieved defervescence within 48 hours in the DXC and LFX groups, respectively ( Table 2) . Direct comparison of TTD between the PMC group and the secondary treatment groups was not possible, because all patients were initially treated with macrolide and added on or switched to CST, DXC, and LFX. Therefore, we performed PS matching to adjust differences in baseline characteristics among the groups and compared TTD after initial macrolide treatment between groups. However, the TTDs after initial macrolide treatment of the CST, DXC, LFX groups did not differ from that of each matched PMC group (P = 0.085, P = 0.453, and P = 0.283, respectively). There was no difference in length of hospital stay between the PMC group and the secondary treatment groups ( Table 3) .",

In addition, the risk of cartilage injury with LFX was clinically undetectable in children over 5 years old, or was easily reversible. 24 Of the 1,340 subjects treated with LFX, only one case (0.07%) was 'possibly related' to drug therapy assessed at 5 years, and this was not different from the comparator group (1/893, 0.1%). However, because concerns about the safety of tetracycline and fluoroquinolone in children still exist, it should be cautiously used with the consideration of both the risk and benefit in children with macrolide-unresponsive MP pneumonia. This study has some limitations. Firstly, as this study was performed retrospectively, the clinical information might be uncertain, especially with regard to the use and duration of macrolide prescribed in other clinics. Secondly, the numbers of patients in DXC and LFX groups were small. In the future, it is necessary to carry out prospective randomized studies or to conduct studies involving more subjects through multicenter studies. Lastly, the IgM antibody test was used to diagnose MP infection. Although the patients with a history of MP infection within past year were excluded, some subjects with false positive could be included due to prolonged existence of IgM for several months after past infection. In addition, false negatives could also exist due to a lack of IgM antibodies in early stages. However, other alternative methods, such as isolation or the molecular detection of MP, cannot differentiate asymptomatic carriage of MP in the nasopharynx from infection or MP pneumonia.",
