Innate immunity is composed of resident components, e.g., pulmonary alveolar macrophages, or recruited components, e.g., neutrophils. Unlike parenchymatous organs, the brain depends solely on resident innate immunity to recognize and clear pathogens. In other words, under normal nondisease conditions, the brain does not rely either on adaptive immunity or the recruited components of innate immunity for defense. Innate immunity in the brain is diverse and composed of structural units, e.g., blood-brain barrier (BBB), plus cellular and chemical components.",

One of the most important effiux proteins is P-glycoprotein.",

For example, several neurotropic viruses bypass the BBB and invade the brain via axons (e.g., Rabies virus); intracellular bacteria (e.g., M),cobacterium boris) invade the brain as Trojan horses, hidden in infected leukocytes; and finally some bacteria have a direct cytotoxic effect on the endothelial cells of the BBB (e.g., Histophilus somni).",

For example, all three cell types are rich in macrophage mannose receptor, which is a lectin receptor that recognizes \"nonself\" sugars on the cell wall of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, parasites, and yeasts. Microglia cells also express several tool-like receptors, e.g.,TLR 2 and 6, which have a major role as bridges between innate and adaptive immunity.Activated microglia express several receptors important for phagocytosis, e.g., CR3 and CR4; recognition of pathogens is followed by phagocytosis, largely by microglial cells and to a lesser extent by astrocytes. Finally, glial cells release several cytokines and antimicrobial peptides, for example, interleukin-l]3, tumor necrosis factor-or, and the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin. Inflammation of the brain starts once an infectious agent overcomes the resident innate immunity and recruiting begins of different components of adaptive immunity (leukocytes and humoral immunity), which are more specific and more effective but also more destructive.

Vascular proliferation and fibrous tissue encapsulation may develop only when the inflammatory reaction involves the meninges and the larger blood vessels because these are the only source of reticulin and collagenous tissue. Investigation continues into how viruses spread in nervous tissue; bacteria and fungi can spread rapidly and extensively in the fluid of the ventricular system and meninges. Spread of infection from the ventricular fluid to the periventricular veins occurs readily across the ependyma, and spread from the meninges to the brain, or vice versa, can occur via the Virchow-Robin spaces.

Erysipelas, in which arthritis is a typical lesion, is an exception in that it may produce septicemic and embolic lesions in the brain but it does not cause suppurative meningitis. Several bacteria, such as streptococci and E. coli, cause bacteremia and suppurative meningitis in neonates resulting in an important clinical entity, especially in ruminants and pigs, called neonatal bacterial suppurative meningitis (NBSM) . Streptococcal NBSM in calves, lambs, and piglets (but not in foals), frequently has a combination of polyarthritis, purulent leptomeningitis, choroiditis and, in calves only, endophthalmitis ( Fig. 3.101A, B) . In pigs, Streptococcus suis types 1 and 2 (see Vol. 1, Bones and joints) cause NBSM that is usually accompanied by polyserositis; S. suis meningitis is suppurative in the acute stage, and lymphoplasmacytic in pigs that survive. Streptococcus pneumoniae usually produces fulminating septicemia in calves characterized only by very acute splenitis but, if the course of this infection is less fulminating than usual, polyarthritis and meningitis can be found. E. coli, another cause of NBSM of protracted course, commonly causes well-developed meningitis and polyarthritis in neonatal calves and lambs, but even in fulminating infections the mild changes of early inflammation can be found in these structures. On the other hand, both coliform and streptococcal infections in calves and piglets may avoid the joints and meninges and localize instead in the choroid plexuses and spread from there to the ventricles and brain, or localize in the brain alone. The coliforms and streptococci behave differently in calves with respect to the eyes; a combination of synovial, meningeal, and intraocular localizations is almost invariably of streptococcal origin (and the lesions can be well developed within 12 hours of birth, or even at birth according to farmers); the coliforms can, but only seldom do, cause endophthalmitis. Mannheimia haemolytica and P. multocida are usually regarded only as causes of fibrinous pneumonia and hemorrhagic septicemia, but they are responsible for localized infections in other locations, including the meninges, in ruminants. When polyarthritis is present in septicemic or pulmonary pasteurellosis, fibrinosuppurative leptomeningitis can also be anticipated. Isolated cases and limited outbreaks of pasteurellosis that is entirely meningeal are observed in cattle and sheep, usually young ones. The course is asymptomatic until meningitis develops.",

On careful inspection by naked eye, almost every case of purulent meningitis can be detected but the microscope may be necessary to confirm some cases. The brain is swollen in every acute case of pyogenic meningitis, and the swelling is frequently severe enough to cause displacement with coning of the cerebellum.

It is possible that obstruction of the meningeal orifices of Virchow-Robin spaces by exudate and stasis of flow of meningeal fluid may contribute to the edema.

Most capsules are very distinct and 1-3 mm wide. Their distinctness is due to the paucity of reticulin or collagen spreading out into the surrounding parenchyma or into the abscess cavity. In old abscesses with shrinkage, the core may separate from the capsule, and the capsule may separate extensively from the surrounding cerebral substance. The surrounding tissue is discolored yellow due to edema, the edematous zone often being much larger than the abscess itself. The microscopic structure of the wall of a chronic abscess does not differ much from case to case except in the thickness of the capsule.A narrow zone of histiocytes or gitter cells faces the neutrophilic debris.The next zone is a laminated layer of collagenous fibers between which are rows of gitter cells laden with debris.

Listerial encephalitis may be sporadic or occur in outbreaks in which the morbidity may be 10% or higher. Outbreaks are usually associated with heavy feeding of silage, with disease most likely occurring in winter and early spring when the animals are indoors. This association of outbreaks of cerebral listeriosis with silage feeding is a circumstantial observation, but the association is so common that silage is fed as a calculated risk and removed from the ration when the first case occurs. The association with silage may indicate an acquired susceptibility of the animals or the provision of a growth medium that leads to heavy infection pressure.The organism will multiply in spoiled silage that is incompletely fermented and with a pH of 5.5 or above. Ingested Listeria is likely to breach the oral mucosal barrier through pathological or physiological wounds, e.g., erupted teeth wounds. After invading the oral mucosa, the bacteria invade the trigeminal nerves and travel centripetally via axons to the brain. Listeria can also breach the blood-brain barrier under experimental conditions; however the specific distribution oflisterial encephalitis in the natural disease is inconsistent with a hematogenous infection. In animals, Listeria has a remarkable a~nity for the brain stem, the lesions being most severe in the medulla and pons and less severe rostrally in the thalamus and caudally in the cervical parts of the spinal cord. Intravenous or oral dosing of pregnant ruminants will regularly produce intrauterine infection but seldom produce intracranial infection and probably never produce encephalitis of the specific distribution. Bacteremias with localization in the CNS regularly cause meningitis, choroiditis, and cerebral abscesses, which is what L. monocytogenes does, but only as an experimental hematogenous infection.

H. somni is a fastidious gram-negative coccobacillus, and a facultative anaerobic organism that is considered normal flora of the male and female bovine genital tract and to lesser extent the bovine nasal cavity. Calves are infected by carrier cows in the first months of life, and they in turn disseminate the infection in feedlots. The mechanism, site, and circumstance by which the bacteria invade the bloodstream are not known, but it is possible that organisms in genital discharges or aerosolized urine invade via the respiratory tract. Infection, especially the respiratory form, is usually preceded by stress factors such as transportation. These bacteria have virulent and avirulent strains. Important virulence factors include lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS), immunoglobulin Fc binding proteins, inhibition of oxygen radicals, and intracellular survival. The mechanism of vasculitis in H. somni infection is complex but it can be partially explained by the effect of LSO on endothelial cells. LSO triggers apoptosis of bovine endothelial cells in vitro by caspase-3 activation. This effect is associated with the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. Cerebral blood vessels are particularly vulnerable to damage by the organism, but vasculitis can develop in most organs.",

In inflamed areas, the oliigodendroglia degenerate. Astrocytes degenerate or react depending on how strictly and severely they are injured-the stimuli for astrocytic reaction were discussed earlier in this chapter. The gliosis that is so frequently a feature of nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis is almost solely microglial. The gliosis may be diffuse or focal but is commonly both (see Fig. 3 .17). Diffuse gliosis may be more apparent than real if due more to hypertrophy than to proliferation of these glia. Focal gliosis may occur anywhere in the parenchyma and may be related to small vessels and injury to microvasculature. When there are more than a dozen or so cells in such foci, some of the cells are likely to be lymphocytes, and occasionally there are a few plasma cells. The microglia in the center of a focus are frequently degenerate.There are two specifically named forms of microgliosis: \"neuronophagic nodules\" are foci of microglia about degenerating neurons (see Fig. 3 .2D);\"glial shrubbery\" is an accumulation of these cells in the molecular layer of the cerebellum in relation to degenerating Purkinje cells (Fig. 3.115) . Neuronal changes must be the principal determinants of the outcome of the infection.The distribution of neuronal degeneration is to some slight extent specific, but the extensiveness is nonspecific and varies considerably. The morphological features of the degenerate cells are nonspecific. As a rule, the more severe degrees of neuronal degeneration are caused by viruses that are highly neurotropic, such as Rabies virus, but the severity of neuronal degeneration is not a dependable \"lead\" in differential diagnosis.The fact that Rabies virus can be lethal without morphological change in the CNS raises the possibility that other viruses may cause severe encephalopathy without inflammatory change. The usual form of neuronal degeneration is central chromatolysis, which may extend to completion with the cell then swollen, pale, and devoid of a nucleus. This is typical of the axonal reaction to injury, but the axons are intact. Many neurons appear as if coagulated, being shrunken, rounded, and isolated, and staining darkly with eosin. The nucleus is pyknotic or has disappeared. The coagulated neuron stimulates the formation of the neuronophagic nodule, but not all necrotic neurons elicit the reaction. Usually, intact neurons can be found adjacent to degenerate ones.",

Evolutionary studies based on genes encoding the surface glycoprotein suggest that RAB V evolved first in bats, possibly in vampire bats much more widely distributed than at present, and only later became adapted to terrestrial carnivores.There is a single major antigenic type with minor variations that allow epidemiological surveillance. Seven genotypes are defined by phylogenetic analysis. Type 1 is the classical Rabies virus of animals and vampire bats, and of all other bat lyssaviruses in North America. Type 2 (Lagos bat virus), type 3 (Mokola virus), type 4 (Duvenhage virus) are African genotypes. Types 5 (EBLV-1) and 6 (EBLV-2) are European bat lyssavirus 1 and 2, and type 7 (Ballina virus) is the Australian bat lyssavirus. The seven genotypes may further be allocated into two major phylogroups based on pathogenicity for mice and cross-neutralization. Phylogroup 1 includes genotypes 1, 4-7, and phylogroup 2 includes genotypes 2 and 3. Excepting Mokola virus, bats may be the preferential vector species for genotypes 2-7.",

The causative agent, Suid herpespirus I (SuHV-1; Pseudorabies virus, P1KV), belongs to the genus Varicellovirus, subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, but is unusual for a member of that group in its relative lack of host specificity and by being spread laterally as well as vertically in swine.A number of strains have been identified which exhibit a wide range of virulence. Pseudorabies virus is capable, as are other members of the family Herpesviridae, of establishing latent infection. Trigeminal ganglion, olfactory bulb, and tonsil are the most consistent sites of latency of PRV. In these organs, viral DNA can be detected in the absence of infectious virus. The pig is the only natural host, but the common domestic species are naturally susceptible; there are very few reports in horses and goats. Progressive infections do not occur in humans.The disease is reported worldwide, except for Canada and Australia. Natural infections occur in rats and mice and various species of wildlife and on fur farms. Of the laboratory animals, the rabbit is the most susceptible and is preferred for identification of the virus because of the fairly consistent development of intense local pruritus following subcutaneous inoculation. Guinea pigs are less susceptible and may resist subcutaneous inoculation but succumb to intracerebral and, occasionally, to intraperitoneal inoculation.",

Animals are susceptible to intranasal inoculation and, regardless of the route of infection, the virus can be found in nasal secretions. The virus may also be present in saliva and urine. It is also present in blood, but this is of no significance for epiderniology or transmission. The infection will occur in pigs by contact very readily and probably by direct nose-to-nose transmission, but it does not appear to be contagious between individuals of other species and they probably acquire their infection by contact with swine or, possibly, rats. Pigs may harbor virus for many months in tonsils and nasopharyngeal secretions after exposure, but in other domestic species the virus is fairly strictly neurotropic, and therefore is not excreted unless given experimentally in large doses. Ingestion of infected pig meat is the usual source of infection for dogs and cats.

The virus causes a local reaction at the site of inoculation if percutaneous and then spreads centripetally along the related nerve to the spinal cord; it then spreads outwards again along other peripheral nerves as other segments of cord are progressively invaded by spread within the CNS. Because of the progressive advance of infection along the cord, death may occur before demonstrable amounts of virus reach the brain and before lesions have time to develop there. Intracerebral inoculation produces encephalitis, and virus spreads to the cord and centrifugally along peripheral nerves to an extent that depends on survival time. Because the virus also circulates in the blood, there is some possibility but no evidence that it invades the brain directly, the evidence instead suggesting that it localizes in viscera and invades the nervous system along autonomic nerves. Following nasal or intraocular exposure, the virus spreads along the related nerves. The route of invasion following ingestion is by retrograde transneuronal infection. Transplacental infections occur in pigs causing abortion in about 50% of sows pregnant in the first month, and the delivery of macerated, mummified, and normal fetuses when infection occurs at later stages of gestation.

Most infected dogs seroconvert without developing TBE, but the peracute disease in dogs has a high fatality rate.Affected dogs are usually euthanized due to associated severe convulsions, tremors, and ataxia.The histologic lesions are those of severe necrotizing lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic meningoencephalomyelitis with severe glial nodule formation affecting mostly the basal ganglia, thalamus, mesencephalon, neuroparenchyma surrounding the fourth ventricle, and the medulla oblongata.

In 1999 it was introduced into New York City where it caused a massive outbreak in animals and humans. During the period of 1999 to 2004, the virus spread rapidly to most of the USA and southern parts of Canada. It has been suggested that the virus was imported from the Middle East, due to genetic similarity between strains isolated in the Middle East and NewYork.The virus is now distributed throughout Africa, central and southern Asia, Australia (where it is called Kunjin virus), the USA, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean.The virus is divided genetically into two lineageslineage 1 WNV is present in North America and some other parts of the world, lineage 2 is restricted to enzootic areas in Africa. Lineage 2 WNV strains are either nonpathogenic or occasionally cause mild human and equine disease. Some clades in lineage 1 (e.g., clade l a) are highly virulent and are believed to be responsible for the recent outbreaks in North America. The virus has a wide host range, but is maintained in the environment mainly by a birdmosquito-bird cycle. Wild birds, especially corvids, i.e., crows, are the main amplifying hosts. Wild birds usually develop prolonged viremia and the virus is distributed in almost every organ. In contrast, the viral antigen in infected horses, which is by far the most susceptible species of domestic animal, is sparse and limited to the CNS. Infection between birds or between birds and mammals or reptiles is mainly via mosquitoes. Mosquitoes of the Culex spp. are the main maintenance vectors.The virus is also found in other vectors such as ticks, but the biological importance of these vectors is yet to be determined. Rare methods of virus transmission include direct contact with infected materials and ingestion. Transplacental WNV transmission is only reported in human.",

When naive horses are infected by the virus, mortality can reach up to 50% of affected horses, and clinical signs range from weakness and anorexia to severe acute ataxia or recumbency. However, the mortality rate decreases dramatically in the following seasons. Gross lesions are usually absent, but a few cases may have acute areas of hemorrhage or malacia affecting the thoracic and/or lumbar spinal cord. Histologic lesions are present mainly in the brain stem and thoracolumbar spinal cord, and to a lesser extent in cerebral cortex and cervical cord. The cerebellum is usually spared.

The virus exists worldwide in many vertebrates but most commonly infects horses, sheep, cattle, cats, dogs, and ostriches. The traditional endemic area is central Europe, but antibodies to the virus are found in horses outside Europe, including the USA and Japan. The mortality rate may be high (>80% in horses, 5-40% in sheep); surviving horses may be asymptomatic carriers, or may suffer relapses of disease.The virus has a controversial link to several human neuropsychiatric illnesses. In experimental hosts (tree shrews, rats), infection with BDV not only produces pathoanatomic changes, i.e., nonsuppurative encephalitis, but also behavioral changes and learning deficits. The virus replicates in the nucleolus of the host cell without cytopathic effect, persistently infects cells, and induces brain lesions by immune-mediated mechanisms. In Lewis rats, acute (4-8 weeks postinfection) BDV infection is followed by massive infiltrates in the brain of CD4 + Thl, CD8 + T, and NK cells with a predominance of Thl cytokines that favors cell-mediated immunity. In the chronic stage (beyond 15 weeks of infection), the aforementioned cellular infiltrates significantly decrease and the predominant cytokines are of Th2 type, favoring the shift to a humoral immune response; the resultant antibodies are not protective and have no significant effect on the disease. Due to this unique feature, infection of neonatal or immunocompromised animals does not lead to disease or to encephalitis.",

The earliest sign may be barely perceptible caudal ataxia and fine trembling of the lips. The first sign to be noticed may be extensor paralysis of the hindlimbs. Once paralytic signs are evident, a fatal outcome appears certain. There is no fever and no sign of cerebral dysfunction, and death is due to starvation or secondary infection. The incidence of visna is relatively low. The course of the infection can be followed fairly well by routine examination of the CSF for lymphocytosis.",

Both viruses are widespread in horses, have significant economic impact on the equine industry, and are responsible for several clinical conditions including respiratory disease, pulmonary vasculotropic disease, enteric disease, and abortion. Equine myeloencephalopathy is an important neurological disease characterized clinically by ataxia, paresis, and paralysis, and caused mainly by EHV-1 and incidentally by EHV-4. Almost all recent outbreaks have been associated with EHV-1 infection. Other members of equine alpha-herpesviruses that are pathogenic but do not cause neurologic disease include Equid herpesvirus 3 (Equine coital exanthema virus) and Equid herpesvirus 8 (Asinine herpesvirus 8), which induces interstitial pneumonia in donkeys. Equid herpesvirus 9 (Gazelle herpesvirus) causes severe encephalitis experimentally in several species of domestic animals; the natural outbreak of fulminant encephalitis has been reported in a herd of Thomson's gazelles that were in close association with zebra. The natural reservoir for EHV-9 is unknown, but zebras or other equidae have been suspected. Most horses show serologic evidence of exposure to EHV-1 and EHV-4 but are asymptomatic, and vaccination does not necessarily confer protection from neurologic manifestations. Both viruses contain at least 13 glycoproteins, which are important virulence factors for attachment, entry to the host cell, and cell-to-cell dissemination. The natural spread of EHV-1 is through direct horseto-horse contact, by inhalation of nasal aerosols from infected horses, or through direct contact with an infected aborted fetus or placenta. EHV-1 replicates first in upper respiratory tract epithelium and local lymph nodes, and then induces T-cell and monocyte-associated viremia that ends with invasion of endothelial cells of the CNS and pregnant uterus. This leukocyte-associated viremia protects the virus from humoral immunity. The virus is endotheliotropic, epitheliotropic, and neurotropic, but not neurovirulent. The replication of virus in endothelial cells of the CNS leads to initiation of the inflammatory cascade that ends in thrombo-occlusive necrotizing vasculitis. The resultant myeloencephalopathy is due to destruction of CNS tissue secondary to vasculitis. The vasculitis is either due to direct viral cytotoxic effect or due to an immune-mediated (Arthus-type reaction) mechanism. A similar mechanism is responsible for EHV-1induced abortion and pulmonary vasculotropic disease. There are no genetic or antigenic differences between the EHV strains isolated from neurogenic cases versus abortigenic or respiratory cases.",

The disease is common in late winter and spring, which is also the time of greatest prevalence of EHV-1 abortion outbreaks. The incubation period is 6-10 days and usually occurs in association with abortion and/or respiratory disease but can occur without preceding signs. All ages are susceptible, but pregnant mares and mares nursing foals are over-represented. Clinical signs start with fever and mild rhinitis. Neurologic signs are variable and depend on the part of the CNS affected by vasculitis, however common clinical signs include variable degrees of symmetrical ataxia and paresis that are more severe in pelvic limbs. Fecal and urinary incontinence are common, and clinical signs may end in hemi-or paraplegia. Gross and histologic lesions are sequelae to vasculitis. Gross lesions are not always present, but small (0.2-0.5 cm) random multifocal areas of hemorrhage may be present throughout the meninges, brain, and spinal cord (Fig. 3.127) . In severe cases, multifocal necrohemorrhagic or malacic areas (up to 1.5 cm in diameter) can be present, especially in the white matter of spinal cord or the white or gray matter of the brain. The characteristic histologic lesions are nonsuppurative necrotizing vasculitis and thrombosis, with greater prevalence in the meningeal and parenchymal blood vessels of the brain stem and spinal cord. Perivascular edema, hemorrhage, focal areas of malacia, and infarction are present adjacent to the affected blood vessels. Occasionally, axonal swelling and mild nonsuppurative trigeminal ganglionitis are present. Extraneural lesions include uveal vasculitis and optic neuritis, especially in foals, and testicular and epididymal vasculitis in stallions. ",

Brown, hemorrhagic discoloration depends on the parasite hitting a vein or arteriole, and it appears that some worms have a tendency to migrate along veins.

Occasional mitoses are present in these cells. Transformation to epithelioid cells occurs later. The perivascular aggregates expand in concentric arrangements and displace surrounding parenchyma (Fig. 3.142) . Where the cuffing response is severe, edema and necrosis may occur in the adjacent white matter leading to a spillover of mononuclear cells into the parenchyma and to the usual reactive changes. Large malacic loci are unusual. In cases of prolonged duration, confluence of lesions occurs and reparative responses include the deposition of abundant reticulin and collagen in perivascular arrangements. Involvement of meninges is patchy and often related to lesions of white matter directly underlying. Cytological characterization of the cell aggregates can be difficult. In many, and perhaps most, cases, the cells are easy to classify, being well differentiated as lymphocytes, monocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes ( Fig. 3.143 ). Granulocytes may be present but are not numerous, and histiocytes often show epithelioid transformation and may form small syncytial masses. There may also be in some cases large immature cells of reticulohistiocytic type in which mitoses may be few or many. Differentiation between GME and brain malignant histiocytosis (BMH) can be problematic occasionally; BMH is frequently part of a multisystemic tumor and rarely occurs in isolation. Also, the absence of cellular atypia and the predominance of perivascular orientation should favor the diagnosis of GME. ",

Sylvatic vectors are responsible for most transmissions to man and domestic animals in countries where dog populations are controlled. Oral vaccination of wild carnivores, by using vaccine-laden baits, and routine vaccination of dogs have led to almost complete elimination of canine-transmitted rabies in developed countries. Rarely, vaccination of severely stressed animals with vaccines containing modified-live virus may induce postvaccinal rabies. In tropical areas where domestic and feral dogs are not controlled, these animals are the principal hazards for man and livestock.Bats present a special epidemiologic problem. Fructivorous and insectivorous bats as well as vampires are capable of transmitting RABV. Vampire bats inhabit South and Central America extending into northern Mexico and are, historically, responsible for a high incidence of rabies in mammals, especially cattle but including humans.When clinically affected, vampire bats manifest the disease as the furious form and show unnatural daylight activity.",

Other canids, e.g., coyotes (Canis latrans), may also be important definitive hosts. N. caninum has three infectious stages: tachyzoites, tissue cysts, and oocysts. Tachyzoites and tissue cysts are found both in intermediate hosts and the definitive host. However, oocysts are only present in the definitive host.Tachyzoites have been found in neurons, reticuloendothelial cells, hepatocytes, muscle cells including myocardium, and bovine placenta.Tissue cysts have been found in the CNS, muscles, and retina. The exact modes of transmission are not well understood. Dogs become infected by ingesting tissues contaminated with tissue cysts, and then shed oocysts in their feces.
