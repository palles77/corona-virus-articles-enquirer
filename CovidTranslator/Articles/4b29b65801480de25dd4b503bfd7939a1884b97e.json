Local and national medical staff worked in isolation wards, fever clinics, the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and other related departments. Some medical staff became infected with COVID-19 when they were treating infected patients. Chinese medical staff have shown professionalism and care, but the physical and psychological health of medical staff is at risk when working under such conditions, and anxiety and stress can also adversely affect sleep.",

For clinical staff, good sleep quality not only helps them to work better to treat patients but also maintains optimal immune function to prevent infection [7] . Therefore, sleep quality is an important indicator of health. Also, psychological wellbeing and sleep are affected by many socio-cultural factors [8] . Social support is a significant social factor. Social support refers to the care and support that people feel they get from other people [9] . Adequate social support has previously been reported to have a positive effect on psychological health and sleep function [10, 11] . Also, anxiety is a common negative emotion experienced by medical staff during epidemics of infectious diseases [12] . The COVID-19 epidemic has become a stressor, particularly as this is a new viral infection does not have a vaccine and can only be treated symptomatically at present. Self-efficacy refers to individual judgment on the ability to complete a certain behavior or task [13] . Self-efficacy helps medical staff cope with high-risk and high-intensity work and help them maintain a stable mental state. The effect of emotion such as anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy on sleep quality has been shown by previous studies [14, 15] . These variables of anxiety, self-efficacy, stress, sleep quality, and social support and their interactions can be analyzed by structural equation modeling (SEM), which is a multivariate analysis method to determine the structural relationship between measured variables. Therefore, this observational study, conducted at the Wuhan University School of Medicine, China, aimed to use SEM to determine the effects of social support on sleep quality and function of medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 in January and February 2020. The two assumptions made in this observational study were that the social support given to the medical staff directly affected their sleep quality, and that social support affected sleep quality by reducing anxiety and stress and by increasing self-efficacy as intermediate variables.",

The findings from this study showed that the sleep quality of the medical staff was low with a mean PSQI score of 8.583. Compared with the normal Chinese PSQI score of 7 points, the sleep quality of medical staff who treated COVID-19 was relatively low. There were several factors that may have resulted in reduced sleep quality in the medical staff. Doctors and nurses had to wear protective clothing every day, including hazardous materials (HazMat) suits. The staff worked continuously in the isolation wards with high work intensity and under pressure. Also, some of the patients could not be cured, and infection with COVID-19 is associated with patient mortality [1] [2] [3] .",

Social support can help medical staff reduce anxiety levels, as friends or family members provide social and emotional support and share empathy [21] . Social interactions reduce negative emotions such as anxiety and can improve mood [22] . Currently, with the increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 infection in China, front-line medical staff are required to wear protective masks and protective clothing, which may cause added stress. When medical staff have a wide social network, social support can help to reduce stress by reducing the perception of the threat of stressful events and the physiological response and inappropriate behavior that can result from stress [23] . Social support contributes to improving self-efficacy, leading to more understanding, respect, encouragement, courage, and a sense of professional achievement [24] . Self-efficacy results in increased confidence to do the job well, and when combined with social support, members of the medical profession suffer less from loneliness and might be more optimistic, which improves coping mechanisms when under stress [25, 26] .",

Anxiety affects sleep quality because anxious people often find it difficult to fall asleep and may wake up frequently during sleep [27] . Also, the combination of anxiety with sleep disorders may make it difficult to fall asleep [28] . The fact that stress is closely related to sleep quality has been confirmed by a previous study [29] . Increased stress can increase the levels of vigilance regarding the environment, which will reduce sleep quality [30] . However, self-efficacy is a positive mental state that may enhance sleep quality [31] . People with high self-efficacy can maintain relatively stable emotions even under pressure, and they may experience fewer episodes of night waking, sleep anxiety, and sleep onset delay [32] . Self-efficacy also increases concentration and self-control [33] . Even though all medical staff experience pressure at work, people who have high self-efficacy are able to control their emotions and try to sleep regularly after work. Therefore, with high self-efficacy, medical staff may have good sleep quality. Anxiety has been shown to increase sensitivity to work pressure and the working environment and has a negative effect on self-efficacy because it reduces positive behaviors and initiative [34, 35] .

For example, professional psychotherapy teams should take the initiative to support the mental health of medical staff and provide individually targeted interventions. Hospital managers should provide logistic support for medical staff, and support groups for medical staff should be established. However, this study had several limitations. Firstly, this was a cross-sectional study with a small sample size, and definitive causal relationships remain to be established. For example, anxiety may increase stress, and stress may increase anxiety [36] . However, anxiety has been shown to result in impaired sleep, and poor sleep quality increases anxiety [37] . Therefore, cohort studies with larger samples are needed to investigate the effects of social support on sleep quality and function of medical staff who are working with increased levels of stress and increased workloads, as with the COVID-19 infection epidemic in Wuhan, China. Also, this study used subjective self-reported questionnaires to obtain the data. Future studies should include objective indicators of stress, such as measurements of serum cortisol level with the questionnaire [38] .",
