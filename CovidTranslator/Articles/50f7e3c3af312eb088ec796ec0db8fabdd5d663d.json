            "text": "Background: The widespread nursing shortage is of concern in Mainland China and globally. Factors underpinning the increased mobility of the nursing workforce and their contribution to nurses' turnover thus merit attention. Understanding nurses' job satisfaction is important, as this is a key factor in nurses' turnover. Objective: The study aimed to explore nurses' views and experience regarding different components of their working lives in Mainland China. Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was selected and 512 nurses working in the medical and surgical departments in two teaching hospitals in Beijing completed questionnaires yielding a response rate of 81%. Results: More than half of nurses (53.7%; n \u00bc 275) were satisfied or very satisfied with their jobs and 15% (n \u00bc 77) felt moderate to extreme occupational stress. The majority of the sample reported a high level of organizational commitment (63.7%; n \u00bc 326) and professional commitment (85.9%; n \u00bc 440) and only 5.9% (n \u00bc 30) and 10.0% (n \u00bc 51), respectively reported role conflict and role ambiguity often or very often. Nurses with a diploma or associate degree reported greater professional commitment and a lower level of role conflict than those with a bachelor degree (po0.05), but there were no significant differences in job satisfaction, organizational commitment, occupational stress and role ambiguity by educational programme (p40.05). Conclusions: Hospital nurses' positive feelings regarding their working lives may be influenced by developments in the health care system and the nursing profession in Mainland China. Nurses' educational level is an influencing factor on nurses' views and experiences of their working lives with the findings suggesting the need to develop a clinical career ladder for nursing staff in Mainland China. r",

Job mobility has also been fuelled by more relaxed immigration policies which has meant an increase in the number of Chinese nurses being recruited to western countries where salaries and opportunities are better (Ho, 1995) . Recruitment and retention of nurses are persistent problems associated with job satisfaction. There is an urgent need for rigorous research regarding job satisfaction and related factors to inform the development of good nurse employment strategies in Mainland China.",

Inadequate or confused information about what work the nurse should cover, the limits of the role and other people's expectations of how the nurse's role fits in with their expectations produce role ambiguity (Hingley and Cooper, 1986 ).",

Job mobility has become a reality and pressures are building for higher rewards for the country's health care professional workforce (Ho, 1995) . Additionally, nursing model reforms have impacted on the delivery of health care. The patient-centred holistic nursing care model has gradually replaced the traditional disease-centred nursing care model. However, primary nursing has only been introduced in leading hospitals because of the nurse shortage and a lack of appropriate knowledge and skills in the nursing workforce (Ministry of Health, China, 2003) .",

However, most of the study's respondents expressed their intention to leave their current hospitals. Such ambivalent findings might be explained by the influence of culture. Glazer et al. (2004) have suggested that people's understanding of organizational commitment could be affected by their national culture. Chang (1999) further pointed out that employees in Asian countries are more likely than employees in Western countries to expect job security from their employers as part of their psychological contract of employment. These employees, in turn, are more committed when they feel that their employers have fulfilled this commitment. Therefore, nurses' high level of commitment to their hospitals does not remove the potential of turnover. Indeed, organizational commitment due to the communal nature of a culture may not contribute to nurses' retention, as nurses are encouraged to build up an equally strong commitment to their new organization following a job change.",

Cox (1987) suggested that stress resides in the person's perception of the balance or transaction between the demands on him/her and his/her ability to cope with these. Thus occupational stress exists in people's recognition of their inability to cope with demands relating to work (Cox, 1985) and the findings suggest that the majority of the sample had the abilities to cope with the work demands placed upon them. Hingley and Cooper (1986) pointed out that for all individuals competence is a primary need at work, with incompetence being a major source of job stress due to its thwarting the individual to perform effectively or to feel effective. Nurses' improved professional competence might therefore be associated with their lower occupational stress. In this study, some characteristics of the respondents including age, length of working time and educational level may be a proxy of their higher professional competence. For example, half of respondents had worked in their current hospital for 5 years or more (n \u00bc 324, 63.3%). In general, they were proficient in nursing techniques and skills and were able to resolve problems independently at work. Further, most respondents were 35 years old or younger (n \u00bc 473, 92.4%) and half had an associate degree or bachelor degree (n \u00bc 282, 55.1%). Therefore, it is possible that they had abilities to cope with new situations and technology.",

The nature and quality of relationships at work has been identified as a major source of occupational stress (Greenburg, 1980) . Hingley and Cooper (1986) also suggested that poor relationships with colleagues and superiors are an important source of stress for nurses. This was highlighted in Bradley and Cartwright (2002) study which found that nurses who perceived more support from managers were less likely to experience job stress (r \u00bc \u00c00.12, po0.05) although the extent to which this applies to Mainland China is uncertain as no equivalent research has been published regarding Chinese nurses.",

For example, Blegen's (1993) meta-analysis found that nurses who were older and had longer working experiences were more likely to be satisfied with their job. Yin and Yang (2002) also found that married nurses were more satisfied with their job than those who were unmarried. In this study, nurses with a bachelor degree were significantly older and had more working experience than nurses with a diploma or associate degree (po0.001). Additionally, most of the nurses with a bachelor degree were married (po0.001). It is possible that these respondent characteristics had an impact on the relationship between job satisfaction and educational level.",

Another possibility is that regardless educational level, the staff nurses in the study assumed similar roles and responsibilities, which were clearly described in hospital guideline. In these circumstances a significant difference in nurses' role ambiguity across the three educational programmes would not be expected.",

This may be a reflection of the developments in the health care system and nursing profession. But it is worthwhile to note that nurses' intention to leave is still a serious problem and warrants more attention. International migration of nurses has increased as nurses pursue opportunities for improved pay and opportunities in the wake of global liberalization of trade spurred on by developed countries increasing their international recruitment to meet their health care workforce needs and in doing so creating a 'skills drain' in many developing countries (Kingma, 2001) . One might expect to observe dissatisfaction with changes in education with the influence of American curricula and higher education and limited changes to the nurse's role in the guideline established by the Ministry of Health, China, but it is likely that those experiencing greatest dissonance between the expectations and reality of their role will have entered the global labour market and such individuals would not have been recruited to this study. Further research is needed to test the impact of educational level upon job satisfaction, occupational commitment, occupational stress and role ambiguity using other samples.",

It is suggested that nurses' educational background should be considered an important factor in understanding nurses' working lives and may indicate the need for a clinical career ladder for nursing staff in Mainland China. Such a ladder, which uses a grading structure to facilitate career progression by defining different levels of clinical and professional practice in nursing, has been successfully introduced in other countries such as the UK (Buchan, 1999) . Further, Krugman et al.'s (2000) work in the USA found that the use of a clinical ladder facilitated nurses' professional development, strengthened their organizational commitment and increased their job satisfaction in a study evaluating 10 years of progressive change.",
