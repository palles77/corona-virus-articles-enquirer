PCV-1 is considered apathogenic and ubiquitous throughout the world. PCV-2 on the other hand, has been associated with various disease syndromes in pigs, including congenital tremors, post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and recently also dermatitis/nephropathy syndrome (Allan et al., 2000b; Rosell et al., 2000; Thomson et al., 2000) . The syndrome PMWS was \u00aerst identi\u00aeed in 1991 in a Canadian SPF-herd and PCV-2 was subsequently associated with the disease . PCV-2 has since been identi\u00aeed in association with cases of PMWS from other countries in Northern America, Europe and Asia Choi et al., 2000; Fenaux et al., 2000; Mankertz et al., 2000; Mori et al., 2000; Wellenberg et al., 2000) but to date information on sero-prevalence and modes of virus transmission is limited. However, serum antibodies to PCV-2 seem to be widespread in the swine populations of those countries where testing has been carried out . In the case of PMWS, other viruses such as porcine parvovirus (PPV) or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV; Allan and Ellis, 2000) as well as non-speci\u00aec activation of the immune system (Allan et al., 2000a; Krakowka et al., 2001) have been demonstrated as cofactors in the full expression of disease syndromes.",

Due to the risk of PPV transmission via AI semen, sows were vaccinated against this virus and due to conventional handling of feed and straw sows were also vaccinated against the bacteria Erysipelothrix rhusiopatie. The herd is tested free from a number of pathogens 1 (Wallgren and Vallga \u00carda, 1993; Wallgren et al., 1999) and the overall pathogen load is considered to be low indicated by a high weight gain, a low incidence of medical treatments and a low mortality (Wallgren, 1994 (Wallgren, , 2000 .

The percentage of small litters (<6 piglets) and repeat breeders were also on a fairly low and uniform level. During the second quarter of 1993 pre-weaning piglet mortality increased due to the EE outbreak. The number of stillborn piglets and the percentage of small litters were also unusually high during this quarter. Further, aborting sows and sows found non-pregnant during late stage gestation was increased for animals covered during the \u00aerst three quarters of 1993. Despite a previous normal fertility of the heard teaser boar, none of the sows covered by him during the \u00aerst two quarters of 1993 n 5 farrowed.

            "text": "Among viruses, PPV has been put forward as causing skin lesions (Kresse et al., 1985; Choi et al., 1987; Whitaker et al., 1990) , but this virus was not present in the herd in question. Interestingly, PCV-2 has also been associated with skin lesions in the porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (Allan et al., 2000b; Rosell et al., 2000; Thomson et al., 2000) . The PCV-2 serology revealed that the SPF-herd was sero-negative at least until February 1993. Two months lather, around the EE outbreak, the pigs showed varying levels of antibodies to PCV-2. All the monitored piglets sero-converted later that year and the herd has remained sero-positive since. The serological evidence thus reveal an active infection with PCV-2. Further, the presence of serum IFN-a in the young pigs also indicates viral activity amid the piglets. We therefore hypothesise that PCV-2 replicating in the na\u00f5 \u00c8ve piglets caused the skin lesions necessary for S. hyicus to gain access to the dermis, and thereby predisposed for the EE outbreak. Indeed, PCV-2 was also isolated from one of the EE affected piglets which is the \u00aerst time this virus has been isolated in Sweden. Moreover, the introduction of PCV-2 in the herd coincided with the most pronounced reproductive disturbance ever recorded in the herd. Indeed, PCV-2 has been associated with reproductive problems (West et al., 1999) , and the observed increases in number of stillborn piglets, percentage of small litters and repeat breeders may therefore have been caused by the introduction of the virus into the herd. Further, it is likely that the fertility problems were due to PCV-2 infection of na\u00f5 \u00c8ve or insuf\u00aeciently immune pregnant sows and gilts as this type of reproductive signs at least became less evident when PCV-2 became established in the herd.",
