For example, if a laboratory works with samples of human or animal tissues and/or fluids, then precautions to minimize the exposure of all laboratory personnel to blood-borne human pathogens are required. Most countries and provinces have regulations related to safety precautions that may need to be followed by laboratories. In the USA, regulations specify approaches necessary to protect employees from blood-borne pathogens, general laboratory chemicals and specific chemicals such as formaldehyde. In contrast, if no radioactive material is stored or used in a laboratory, a component of a safety plan focused on radiological safety may be unnecessary. Safety issues related to fire, electrical, and physical safety must be considered by all laboratories; however, regulatory requirements related to these areas of safety are usually promulgated by regional and local governments. Each laboratory should determine which areas of safety are relevant and develop a safety program to protect its employees from exposure to all laboratory hazards. This includes following local, regional, national, and international regulations related to safety as well as education in safety issues that may apply to a specific laboratory/organization.",

For example, web-based resources which may help in understanding the regulations in the USA and some other countries concerning safety are listed in Table 39 .1, while general informational resources, such as review articles (Beekmann and Doebbeling, 1997; Cardo and Bell, 1997; Grizzle and Fredenburgh, 2001; Grizzle and Polt, 1988; Padhye et al., 1998; Richmond et al., 1996; Sewell, 1995) and books (Table 39. 2) are available that may aid in developing a safety program.

As a first step, the likelihood and potential sources of specific injuries for each employee must be determined separately. These risks will depend upon the procedures/activities that an employee performs (i.e. his job) as well as all locations in which the employee is likely to spend time. For example, while office personnel usually would not be expected to be exposed to biohazards, such exposure might occur if the secretary/office personnel pick up contaminated material to be typed, filed, or transferred in a room in which biohazards are present or come into direct contact with surfaces (e.g. benches) or equipment (e.g. computers) which might be contaminated. When these conditions exist for office personnel a safety plan must be written to address specific work hazards that might impose a danger to these employees.",

Training in each area of safety that is important to a specific employee should be provided before the employee begins work in the laboratory. Training must be provided by trainers who are knowledgeable in the area of safety and should be presented in a language and at an educational level that is appropriate for the employees being trained. The training also should be appropriate for the risks to which each employee may be exposed (e.g. for sites not using or storing radioactive material, no training in radiological safety may be required). Thus there will be a need for different levels of training in safety based upon the needs and requirements of each specific employee. This is especially important for employees or contractual personnel who may not be performing risky tasks, but are exposed to risky environments. An example is janitorial personnel who may clean areas of the laboratory. They must be educated as to safety issues associated with the spaces they clean. The training should be updated periodically for each employee according to governmental regulations; in the USA, training of employees in specific areas of safety (e.g. blood-borne pathogens) must be updated annually and a record of the training must be documented in the records of each employee. Records of employee training should be maintained according to regulations; in the USA records must be kept for at least three years.",

The CEO usually appoints a safety committee (SC) which is responsible for developing and implementing and periodically reviewing the overall safety plan (SP) of the institution. The periodic review of the safety plan includes evaluation of the success of the safety plan and required modifications of the safety plan to correct problems with safety or training in safety. The SC appoints a safety officer to administer the safety program. Very large organizations that have many separate large divisions may have separate divisional safety committees and safety officers, especially when specific hazards are limited to only one division (e.g. formaldehyde may be used in only one small area of one of multiple buildings. Specifically, a large clinical laboratory that is part of a university may frequently have a separate safety committee, safety officer, and safety plan. Usually, the administrator responsible for areas with increased safety concerns appoint these separate safety officers; however, the safety committee, officer, and safety plan are always subordinate to the principal safety committee, officer, and safety plan.",

Organizations that provide tissues for research usually will not have permission to test patients and/or their tissue for such agents. A negative test does not ensure safety of the tissues for that pathogen and also there are no tests for some pathogens. Recipients of tissue specimens must agree to educate employees as to the dangers of tissues with which they come into contact, and not to test tissues for human pathogens. When an employee is exposed (cut or needle stick) to human biohazards, immediate medical care is necessary. If the hepatitis B titer is low, a re-vaccination should be considered.

For laboratories requiring a radiological safety plan, the personnel who utilize or come into contact with radioactive material require extensive training as well as the availability of specific equipment to monitor for the extent of radiation and radioactive contamination. As with other areas of safety, the training must be periodically updated and should be appropriate for language and education of personnel. Everyone who has access to the areas where radiation is used or stored should have appropriate training. Depending on the danger of the radioisotopes used, some employees, usually those with professional degrees, may hold a local ''license'' to use specific isotopes and these licensed personnel are responsible for the direction and supervision of all employees who work under their supervision and all spaces to which they are assigned.",

Surveys of all laboratory areas which can detect types of radioactive material being used in the laboratory should be performed periodically. Gamma survey meters are an aid indicating contamination by strong \ue062and \ue067-emitters but periodic surveys of work, floor, and storage areas using swipes are critical to laboratory safety. Contamination is easily spread throughout a building and even to the homes of laboratory personnel. When occupying unsurveyed laboratory space or using unsurveyed equipment (e.g. refrigerators and freezers), these should be certified as radiation free before occupancy or use.",
