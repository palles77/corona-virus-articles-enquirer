The main microbial agents responsible for ALRTI are either bacterial agents (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Mycoplasma pneumoniae) or viruses (respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, also known as human orthopneumovirus), Myxovirus influenzae, Myxovirus parainfluenzae, adenovirus) [1]. More recently, other viruses (rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, bocavirus) have been implicated in ALRTI; their identification has been facilitated by new molecular biology techniques such as real-time PCR. To our knowledge, these emerging viruses have never been the subject of epidemiologic studies in our country.",

Acute respiratory infections are also associated with high morbidity. The incidence is estimated at 0.29 cases per child per year in developing countries, or about 151 million new ALRTI cases each year in developing countries. Among these ALRTI, acute viral bronchiolitis remains a major public health problem, affecting millions of children every year.

Hospitalization criteria are based on the presence of at least one of the following signs: rapid breathing (>60 breaths per minute), chest recession, cyanosis, disturbance of consciousness and eating disorders. Respiratory distress was considered as mild, moderate or severe depending on the intensity of the following parameters: respiratory rate, labored breathing, cyanosis, wheezing or crackles.

The sample was taken at the time of hospitalization and stored at 4\u00b0C until it was sent to the influenza and respiratory virus laboratory of the Pasteur Institute in Sidi Fredj. Each swab was collected and placed in a tube containing 2 mL of virus transport medium (Becton Dickinson, USA). All samples were tested by real-time PCR and conventional PCR. An aliquot of 450 \u03bcL was tested for the presence of the influenza virus, then for RSV and HMPV. Another aliquot was used for conventional multiplex PCR for rhinovirus, coronavirus (OC43, 229E) and parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3. The rest of the sample was stored at \u221280\u00b0C for 1 year.

We studied two main criteria. The first criterion was the proportion of children with identified respiratory tropism virus, both overall and according to different age groups. The second criterion was the proportion of children in whom the following were identified: influenza virus, RSV, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, HMPV and parainfluenza virus.

[14] found a comparable positivity rate (85.5%) in 407 children younger than 5 with acute upper or lower respiratory tract infection. The high rate observed in our study was partly due to the fact that this was a prospective study conducted by nasal sampling with good cost-effectiveness [15] , most often in infants with severe ALRTI during the season corresponding to the peak of viral respiratory infections. This high virus detection rate may reflect the environment in which these children live, where viruses circulate in abundance as a result of family size and promiscuity. The viruses most frequently detected are RSV (48%), HRV (23%), HMPV (22%), adenovirus (7.5%) and influenza (5%). RSV is the most frequently implicated, regardless of the clinical picture, followed by HRV, then HMPV.

The majority of positive RSV cases are concentrated in the period from late January to late March, which corresponds to the coldest months in our region. Thanks to improved molecular biology techniques, the detection of HRV infection has increased considerably, making it possible to link many ALRTI, including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, influenza syndromes and asthma exacerbations, to this virus. HRV (of the Picornaviridae family, like enteroviruses) was detected here only by multiplex PCR in 23.1% of cases, which is within the range found in several studies. The detection rate of HRV ranges from 24% to 48%, and it is generally associated with mild to moderate acute respiratory tract infections [24] [25] [26] . Therefore, it is a widespread viral infection and a frequent cause of care seeking. Miller et al. [27] showed that HRV is detected in nearly 26% of children younger than 5 years hospitalized for respiratory symptoms and fever. Its involvement in severe ALRTI in young children is also important [28] .",

This variability gives a definite advantage to molecular biology techniques versus cell culture [29] , which made it possible to highlight the serotypes in this study. HRV group A and B are the most common groups. HRV group C seems to be responsible for more severe clinical forms [30] . The incidence of HRV in ALRTI in young children has never been studied in Algeria. In our study, HRV was isolated in 23% of children. The average age of the children was 5 months. The clinical picture was not different between HRV-positive and HRV-negative children, or with children in the overall study sample. Smuts et al. [31] found HRV in 58% of young South African children evaluated for wheezing and concluded that HRV is the first viral agent at this age in these children. They did not note a clinical difference between the HRVpositive and HRV-negative groups.",

Nevertheless, most authors have clearly demonstrated that HRV infection is much more frequent in sick children than in asymptomatic children [25, 34] . Metapneumovirus was the last paramyxovirus to be identified in the Netherlands in 2001 [35] . It belongs to the subfamily Pneumovirinae, which also includes RSV and had never been described before in Algeria; this finding is therefore novel. In this study, HMPV was responsible for infections in 22.2% of children. This rate of HMPV infection is high in our study population compared to what has been reported for hospitalized children in other studies. The incidence of HMPV infections is estimated at 5% to 10% of hospitalized ALRTI [36, 37] . In one Dutch study carried out over 17 months on samples from hospitalized patients of all ages, HMPV was found in 6.5% of patients with respiratory infections. Most HMPVs were detected in children under 5 years of age, with a peak observed in children between 4 and 6 months of age [38] . A Greek study found HMPV in 16.5% of samples, followed by HRV (14.3%) [39] . In the same country, a more recent study found HMPV infection in 6% of cases in 127 hospitalized infants under 12 months of age, all with a moderate clinical picture [40] . In our sample, the average age of children was 7.5 months. Van den Hoogen et al. [38] noted, as do we, that patients infected with HMPV are older than those infected with RSV.",
