We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded field trial to determine the efficacy of a commercial M. bovis vaccine for the prevention of M. bovis-associated disease in calves. Calves (n = 373) on 3 Florida dairies with a history of M. bovis infection received an M. bovis bacterin or a placebo, administered subcutaneously at 3, 14 and 35 days of age. One of the herds did not experience M. bovis-associated disease; for calves in the remaining 2 herds, the incidence risk for respiratory disease, otitis media and arthritis from 3 to 90 days of age was 0.64, 0.28 and 0.02, respectively. Vaccination had no effect on the age at first treatment for M. bovis-associated disease, incidence of respiratory disease, mortality, weight gain, or nasal colonization with M. bovis in the first 90 days of life. In one herd, vaccination was associated with an increased risk of otitis media. There was no association between M. bovis-specific serum antibody titers and morbidity in vaccinated calves. Under the field conditions in this study, this vaccine was not efficacious for the prevention of M. bovis-associated disease in young dairy calves.",

Clinical disease caused by M. bovis tends to be chronic, debilitating and unresponsive to antimicrobial therapy [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Disease outbreaks with high morbidity rates occur [1, 2, 10, 15, 16] and can be economically devastating for the affected farm. The costs of infection are primarily associated with intensive treatment of affected calves coupled with culling of animals that are unresponsive to therapy [6] . M. bovis-associated disease is also important from an animal welfare perspective as it often results in calves that are subject to severe, chronic illness for which the producer or veterinarian can provide only limited relief. There is therefore a critical need to develop improved preventative and treatment strategies for M. bovis-associated disease.",

Colonization of the upper respiratory tract of calves with M. bovis often occurs within the first few weeks of life [1, 17] as a result of feeding of milk from cows infected with M. bovis or, probably, by direct or indirect transmission from other calves shedding M. bovis in nasal secretions. Removal of infected milk from the diet by pasteurization or feeding of milk replacer has been successfully applied to reduce infection [1, 15, 16, 18, 19] . Breaks in pasteurization have been associated with subsequent infection outbreaks. Management practices to reduce stocking density and improve ventilation are examples of changes that can reduce undifferentiated respiratory disease in housed calves and have been recommended for M. bovis control [20] [21] [22] . Similarly, control of other pathogens that are involved in the bovine respiratory disease complex is likely to reduce M. bovis infections. Management techniques that improve general immune function, such as improving nutritional status and minimizing environmental stress, have also been suggested as beneficial [21, 22] .",

Vaccines against M. bovis have afforded some protection from respiratory disease in European field trials [23] [24] [25] . Other vaccines have been efficacious against respiratory disease [26, 27] and arthritis [26, 28, 29] in experimental challenge studies. However, in some cases vaccination against M. bovis has significantly exacerbated clinical disease [30, 31] . In addition, most experimental challenge studies have been performed in calves that are substantially older than the age at which natural colonization with M. bovis is typically first observed. Young calves are often colonized by M. bovis within the first few weeks of life [1, 2, 15, 16, 32] , during which time the immune system is undergoing rapid changes associated with maturation [33, 34] . Therefore, agespecific features of the immune system are likely to be important in determining the susceptibility of the young calf to mycoplasmal disease and the efficacy of particular vaccines.",

The paucity of studies that critically evaluate currently marketed M. bovis vaccines and autogenous bacterins in well-designed, independent efficacy studies in an appropriate age group is a major gap in understanding the potential of currently available vaccines as a management strategy to control M. bovis infections in young calves. In part to address this gap, we conducted a field trial using a commercial M. bovis bacterin that was approved for use in feeder and stocker calves. The objective of this field trial was to determine the efficacy of this commercially produced M. bovis bacterin for the prevention of M. bovis-associated disease (respiratory disease, otitis media, arthritis) and mortality in dairy calves up to 90 days of age. Additional objectives were to compare vaccinated and placebo-treated calves with respect to (1) weight gain from birth to 90 days of age, (2) rates of nasal colonization by M. bovis, and (3) M. bovis-specific serum immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrations.",

All necropsies included collection of swabs of the palatine tonsils, tympanic bullae and primary bronchi for mycoplasmal culture. Additionally, if the animal had previously been diagnosed with respiratory disease, arthritis or otitis media, or if any macroscopic lung pathology was observed, appropriate samples were collected from the lesion site(s) to determine the involvement of M. bovis as well as other viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. Further samples were collected when deemed necessary to determine the cause of death by the veterinarian performing the necropsy. All swabs and fresh tissue samples were transported on ice to the laboratory as soon as possible and were processed within 24 h after collection.

In a study of an apparently efficacious vaccine in young calves, Nicholas et al. [26] vaccinated 3-week-old dairy calves with a single dose of inactivated saponin-adjuvanated bacterin. Calves received an aerosol challenge with live M. bovis 3 weeks after vaccination. Vaccinated calves had fewer numbers of M. bovis at colonized sites, fewer body sites colonized by M. bovis, and reduced severity and incidence of clinical disease and lesions as compared to control calves. There was also a significant decrease in body weight gain in control calves compared with vaccinates. Additionally, no vaccinated calves and two of seven control calves developed arthritis. Vaccinated calves produced a strong IgG response prior to challenge, but IgG subtypes were not reported. No adverse events associated with vaccination were reported.",

Calves were vaccinated subcutaneously and received two boosters at 3-week intervals. In one study [24] , three groups of beef calves aged 12, 7 and 3 weeks at the time of first vaccination were used, and calves were followed for 6 months. Respiratory disease occurred in a significantly higher (P < 0.05) proportion of the control calves (27%) compared with the vaccinates (16.3%). In a second study [23] using the same vaccination protocol, M. bovis and BRSV were implicated in outbreaks of respiratory disease during the trial period. Morbidity due to respiratory disease was significantly reduced in vaccinated calves (25%) compared with controls (32%), and mortality in the vaccinated group was similarly reduced (2% and 9% for vaccinates and controls, respectively).

            "text": "There are a number of key differences between the studies reported above and our study that may have influenced vaccine efficacy. Firstly, the strain of bacteria, the antigen concentration, the method of bacterial inactivation and the adjuvant used are all factors that influence the efficacy of bacterial vaccines, although there are limited data on how these affect M. bovis vaccines in particular. Although some of these data are not reported in the above studies, and some are not available for our vaccine (e.g. the adjuvant used is proprietary), it is likely that all these factors varied among our study and those listed above. Secondly, calves in the above studies were first vaccinated at a substantially older age than the calves in our study. Immune responses of the newborn calf have unique characteristics and undergo rapid changes during the first few weeks of life [33] . Vaccination at 3, 14 and 35 days of age (as was performed in our study) may not elicit the same type of immune response as vaccination at 3 weeks of age (as in the Nicholas et al. [26] study, above). Our vaccination protocol was chosen based on (a) protocols that were being applied on dairies in Florida, and (b) the early age of infection that had been observed in previous studies [1] . Thirdly, calves in endemically infected herds in our study became colonized at a very early age, meaning that infection was likely well established before a vaccine-induced immune response could develop. Adaptive immune responses that develop after infection are very inefficient at clearing mycoplasmal infections and often result in detrimental chronic inflammatory responses, and this could contribute to vaccine failure when animals are already infected at the time of vaccination. Lastly, the challenge load of M. bovis that calves are exposed to can affect the efficacy of vaccination. Given the high incidence of clinical mycoplasmal disease (60% of calves treated for M. bovis-associated disease) and the early age of colonization observed in our endemically infected herds, the level of M. bovis challenge that calves were exposed to may have been significantly greater than that of the calves in other vaccine studies [23, 26, 27] .",

A tendency towards Th2-biased IgG 1 -dominated humoral responses has also been reported after infection of calves with M. bovis [39, 40] . As IgG 2 is a much more effective opsonin for phagocytosis of M. bovis than is IgG 1 , an IgG 1 response may be relatively ineffective for control of M. bovis respiratory infections [41] . It is somewhat puzzling that a humoral response to infection was not obvious in control calves in Herd B where there was a high incidence of M. bovis-associated disease. Statistical comparison of IgG 1 responses in control groups in Herds A and B was not conducted. However, it appears that in the control group in Herd A, post-colostral IgG 1 antibody levels continued to decline throughout the study period (see Fig. 2 ), whereas in the control group in Herd B, they did not decline after 7 weeks of age. This result may reflect continued stimulation of the immune response as a result of the endemic nature of M. bovis in this herd. Additionally, M. bovis infection can result in local mucosal antibody responses without eliciting a substantial systemic humoral response [27] . Other investigators have also noted a poor correlation between serum antibody responses and M. bovis infection in individual calves during the first 3 months of life [42] .",

Vaccination was not efficacious in preventing M. bovis-associated disease in pre-weaned calves in two endemically infected Florida dairy herds, nor was it effective at preventing colonization of the upper respiratory tract in older calves in a third herd. The vaccine did stimulate a systemic IgG 1 response that was detectable after the third vaccination, but most clinical disease occurred prior to this response. Calves in these endemically infected herds were colonized with M. bovis at a very young age, and it is likely that this represents the greatest impediment to successful vaccination in this age group. The vaccine used in this field trial was formulated for use in much older cattle (stocker and feeder calves) for the prevention of respiratory disease, and the results of this study should not be extrapolated to infer whether vaccination is efficacious in that age group. Our findings highlight the importance of targeting vaccines for use in young calves specifically to this age group, and illustrate some of the challenges to the development of an efficacious vaccine against M. bovis for use in very young calves, if vaccination of this age group is even possible.",
