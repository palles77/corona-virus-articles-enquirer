AGI was defined as a malfunction of the gastrointestinal tract due to acute illness and was categorized into four grades according to its severity (10) . This AGI grading system was based mainly on gastrointestinal symptoms, intra-abdominal pressure, feeding tolerance or not. AGI grade I was defined as an increased risk of developing gastrointestinal dysfunction or failure (a self-limiting condition); AGI grade II was defined as gastrointestinal dysfunction (a condition that requires interventions); AGI grade III was defined as gastrointestinal failure (GI function cannot be restored with interventions); AGI grade IV was defined as dramatically manifesting gastrointestinal failure (a condition that is immediately life-threatening) (10) . Sepsis was defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, septic shock was defined as a subset of sepsis with circulatory and cellular/metabolic dysfunction associated with a higher risk of mortality (11) .

Categorical variables were presented as absolute numbers or percentages and were analyzed using the \u03c7 2 test or Fisher's exact test. To take into account the repeated nature of the variables, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measurements of the general linear model was implemented. Pearson test was used to analyze the correlation between two variables. To determine the risk factors associated with AGI grade II and above, we performed a series of several univariate logistic regression analyses using the above-mentioned variables. Variables with P <0.1 in univariate analyses were tested in further multivariate logistic regression analyses. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the associations between AGI and MODS, septic shock, and 28-day mortality. Survival curves for up to 28 days after admission and 60 days from disease onset were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared by the log-rank test.

The high MODS incidence (69.9%) and hospital mortality (48.2%) of critically ill patients in this study also confirmed this conclusion. Moreover, we found that the hospital days of patients without AGI were significantly longer than that of patients with AGI. It could be explained by the high 28-d mortality in patients with AGI, because the median hospital stay of non-survivors was only 12.0 (IQR, 8.0-17.8) days, ranging from 3 days to 27 days.",
