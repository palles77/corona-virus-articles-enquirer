No significant difference in radiolabeled virus binding between control and IL-1-, IFN-a-, and IFN-g-treated cells could be observed. Because many of the purified rotavirus particles may not be capable of initiating infection, it was possible that IFN reduced the binding of the infectious fraction of rotavirus particles. Therefore, the binding of infectious particles of both RRV and Wa rotavirus was also measured using previously described methods. 12 As can be seen from Table 2 , this approach failed to show any ",
