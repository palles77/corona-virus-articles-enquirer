In this study, swine enteric caliciviruses were detected in ten samples of intestinal contents from 24 piglets in Japan by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using a broadly reactive primer pair (P290/289) that targeted the highly conserved RNA polymerase regions of the enteric caliciviruses. From the positive samples, the entire viral genome of strain K7/JP and 3 -end parts of the genomes of strains K5/JP and K10/JP were cloned and sequenced. K7/JP had an RNA genome of 7144 bases, excluding its 3 poly (A) tail. The K7/JP genome possessed two open reading frames and characteristics common to sapoviruses. In phylogenetic analysis using amino acid sequences of VP1, K5/JP was demonstrated to be close to the noroviruses previously detected in pigs, and K7/JP and K10/JP were considered to be classified as a new genogroup of sapoviruses.",

The family Caliciviridae is divided into four genera, Norovirus (NV), Sapovirus (SV), Lagovirus (LV), and Vesivirus (VV) [9] . They possess a single-stranded, plus-sense genomic RNA of approximately 7.3 to 8.3 kb [10] . The VVs and NVs have three separate open reading frames (ORFs) in their genomes, whereas the LVs and SVs have genomic organizations composed of two ORFs. The three ORFs of NVs encodes the non-structural proteins (ORF1), the capsid protein (VP1) (ORF2), and a minor structural protein (VP2) (ORF3), respectively. In contrast, the SVs capsid gene is fused to the non-structural gene, while its ORF2 encodes a small protein, considered to be similar to VP2 of NVs [17] .",

NVs were also detected in mice, pigs, and cattle [3, 15, 18, 28, 30] .

AB221132 and AB221131, respectively). We compared the aa sequence identities of K7/JP with those of other caliciviruses, including K5/JP and K10/JP ( Table 2 ). The non-structural protein in K7/JP ORF1 showed 20-33% aa identity with the other viruses examined; the highest identity was shown with the SVs (30-33%), and the lowest identity was with the NVs (20%). K7/JP shared a higher aa identity in the VP1 region with PEC Cowden (37%) than with other SVs (32-36%), VVs (30% and 35%), NVs (25-34%), LVs (23% and 24%), and NB (27%). The VP2 region also showed the highest aa sequence identity (27-34%) with SVs.A phylogenetic tree generated from theVP1 sequences showed that K7/JP and K10/JP were more closely related genetically to the SVs than to the other human and animal caliciviruses (Fig. 3) . K5/JP was Fig. 3 . Unrooted phylogenetic tree of calicivirus VP1s constructed by the neighbor-joining method. The sequences of the strains used in this analysis were either from GenBank or our unpublished data. Trees were prepared using the Treeview programs and are based on 100 bootstrapped data sets. The viruses analyzed in this study are boxed clearly shown to belong to the NVs and to be closely related to SW43 [29] . Similar results were obtained for phylogenetic trees generated from non-structural proteins and VP2 sequences (data not shown). The 5 termini of the genomic and predicted subgenomic RNAs of K7/JP had leader sequences possessing a Kozak structure (G/A NN ATGG), similar to that of PEC Cowden [11] , which is favorable for translation initiation of eukaryotic mRNA [16] (Fig. 2C) . The analysis of the aligned SV sequences showed that a nucleotide stretch located at the junction of the RNA polymerase and VP1 genes was genogroup-specific (GI to GIII) [25] . The junction of K7/JP had a unique sequence compared with those of other SVs, including GIV, which were recently proposed by Farkas et al. [7] (Fig. 2D) . The VP1 regions (544 aa) of K7/JP and K10/JP were the same length as that of PEC and slightly smaller than those of SVs of human origin. The GI, GIV, and GV strains of SVs were found to have an additional ORF overlapping with the VP1 gene [7] . K7/JP and K10/JP did not possess the overlapping frame, resembling instead the SV GII and GIII groups. In the genus SV, the ORF1/2 junction (OOJ) consists of a 1-or 4-nt overlap between the stop codon of ORF1 and the first AUG codon of ORF2 [10] . MV (GI), PEC (GIII), and Arg39 (GV) have 4 nt, but Ln92 (GII) and Hou7 (GIV) have only 1 nt in the OOJ. The OOJs of K7/JP and K10/JP consisted of 4 nt (Fig. 2B) , which differed from the OOJ of LVs (frame-shifted \u221220) and NB (not overlapping, frame-shifted +2).",

By molecular detection and analysis in this study, strains K7/JP and K10/JP were shown to have not only genetic characteristics common to SVs but also unique positions in the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that K7/JP and K10/JP comprise a new SV genogroup. This is the first report to show the existence of SVs other than PEC in a pig population. The sequence identity of VP1 between K7/JP and K10/JP was 88%, and the two new swine SVs were considered to be in the same genetic cluster. We detected pol genes in the other samples, which showed 59-97% identity with K7/JP. According to the phylogenetic analysis, the pol genes were grouped in a branch independent of the four genera of caliciviruses (Fig. 1) . The amplification of the VP1 regions of such samples has been unsuccessful or is ongoing, but the genetic diversity of swine enteric caliciviruses may be confirmed by analyzing the samples.",

[28] first detected the NV genes SW43 and SW913 in 1117 cecum samples from healthy pigs on 26 farms in Shizuoka prefecture, Japan, in 1997. Five years later, we found an additional swine calicivirus strain, K5/JP, which was genetically related to the original swine strains, in the intestinal contents of piglets from a southwestern prefecture of Japan, situated more than 800 km from Shizuoka prefecture. In The Netherlands, NVs were detected in two stool samples from pig farms; partial pol gene sequences of these NVs strongly resembled (100% for aa) those of SW43, although the VP1 sequences were unknown [30] . As similar NV strains were detected from pigs in apparently unrelated situations and were grouped into a similar cluster, it was suggested that the NV in this cluster of GII might be unique to pigs. Recently, high prevalence of antibodies against swine NV SW918 in pigs in Japan and the United States was shown by an enzyme immunoassay based on baculovirus-expressed SW918 virus-like particles [6] . In that study, antibodies against human NVs of GI as well as GII were also detected in pigs in the US, indicating that not only GII NVs but also GI NVs may exist in pigs. Further research is required to show the epidemiological significance of swine NVs detected in the pig population.",

In Japan, caliciviruslike particles, as well as coronavirus-and astrovirus-like particles, were detected in acute porcine gastroenteritis by electron microscopy [26] . However, the relationship between the enteric caliciviruses detected in this study and diseases manifested by the piglets from which the samples were obtained is unclear at present. To elucidate the role of swine enteric caliciviruses other than PEC, intensive clinical and virological monitoring will be needed. The nucleotide sequence data on enteric caliciviruses obtained in the present study will be useful for such monitoring in the future. In addition, the positive samples in this survey may have a use in experimental infections using specific-pathogen-free pigs, although it is necessary to establish monitoring methods for virus shedding and antibody response, as well as to eliminate other enteropathogenic agents that may exist in the inoculum.",

Phylogenetic tree analysis, based on the sequence data ofVP1, suggests that K7/JP and K10/JP belong to a new SV genogroup and that K5/JP belongs to a cluster of swine NVs. It is speculated that several genetic types of enteric caliciviruses may circulate simultaneously in pigs. As the VP1 genes of these new swine caliciviruses were isolated as cDNA clones, virus-like particles can be produced by recombinant expression of VP1 using the baculovirus expression system. These particles may be used in further studies, such as serological surveys of the swine population and antigenic comparison with related viruses of human origin.",
