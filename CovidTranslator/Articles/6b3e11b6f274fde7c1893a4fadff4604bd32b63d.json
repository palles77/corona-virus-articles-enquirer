Such functions are frequently mediated by the sequestration or release of nucleolar proteins. Our understanding of protein targeting to the nucleolus is much less complete than our knowledge of membrane-spanning translocation systems-such as those involved in nuclear targetingand the experimental evidence reveals that few parallels exist with these better-characterized systems. Here, we discuss the current understanding of nucleolar targeting, explore the types of sequence that control the localization of a protein to the nucleolus, and speculate that certain subsets of nucleolar proteins might act as hub proteins that are able to bind to multiple protein targets. In parallel to other subnuclear structures, such as PML bodies, the proteins that are involved in the formation and maintenance of the nucleolus are inexorably linked to nucleolar trafficking.

            "text": "our understanding of nucleolar function changed markedly with the formulation of the plurifunctional nucleolus hypothesis (pederson, 1998) , which has now been underpinned by proteomic analysis (Boisvert et al, 2007) , and proposes that the nucleolus has multiple functions in health and disease (Matthews & olson, 2006; Stark & taliansky, 2009 ). For example, there is extensive evidence that the nucleolus is involved in the response to cellular stress (Mayer & grummt, 2005; rubbi & Milner, 2003) , and in the regulation of the cell cycle and cell growth (Martindill & riley, 2008) . the nucleolus can also be a target for virus infection (Hiscox, 2007) and perturbations to the nucleolus have been observed in a wide range of cellular diseases, from auto-immunity to cancer (Montanaro et al, 2008) . the regulation of many nucleolar roles is mediated by the sequestration or release of specific proteins, thereby providing insight into one of the mechanisms by which the nucleolus operates. this is illustrated by the sequestration of nF-\u03baB (rela) to the nucleolus in colo rectal cancer cell lines in the presence of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, which induces apoptosis (thoms et al, 2007) . another implication of continuous protein sequestration and release is that the nucleolar proteome is contin uously changing in response to metabolic cond itions and driving metabolic change (lam et al, 2007) . For example, the ribosomal-and part nucleolar-protein l23 is retained in the nucleolus by npM, thereby enhancing Miz1-mediated cell-cycle arrest (Wanzel et al, 2008) . npM also sequesters the ribosomal protein S9 in nucleoli and directly affects ribosome biogenesis (lindstrom & zhang, 2008) . the localization and stability of nucleolinone of the most abundant nucleolar proteins-can also change in response to differing metabolic conditions such as osmotic changes (yang et al, 2008) and developmental stages (Bicknell et al, 2005) . Similarly, alterations in cellular pH-for example, reviews concept owing to hypoxia or acid osis-have been shown to cause the nucleo lar sequestration of the VHl protein (Mekhail et al, 2004) , one function of which is to degrade HiF, which activates genes involved in tumour vascularization and oxygen homeo stasis. therefore, the sequestration of VHl to the nucleolus during hypoxia or acidosis-which is mediated by a H + -responsive nucleolar localization signal (nolS)-allows the activation of HiF until normal cellular conditions are reached, which results in the release of VHl from the nucleolus and the subsequent inhibition of HiF function (Mekhail et al, 2004) . the continuous exchange of nucleolar proteins with the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm in response to fluctuating cellular conditions indicates that nucleolar proteins might have specific signals or pathways that determine nucleolar sequestration or release.",

            "text": "the nucleolus consists of complex protein-protein and proteinnucleic acid interactions, and, although it is imaged as a steadystate structure, high-throughput proteomic analysis of purified nucleoli coupled with live-cell imaging of fluorescently labelled nucleolar proteins has revealed a dynamic nuclear compartment, the components of which undergo continuous exchange with the nucleoplasm (andersen et al, 2005; Hernandez-Verdun, 2006) . the current human nucleolar proteome database-which has an estimated 80% coverage-consists of more than 4,500 proteins (ahmad et al, 2009 ). Many nucleolar proteins interact with one another, and with other nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins depending on trafficking and the cell-cycle stage (Fig 2) , and perturbations to certain proteins in the nucleolus-either enrichment or ablation-have a knock-on effect on partner proteins and, hence, function. the nucleolus is assembled in mitosis, when nucleolin, npM, fibrillarin and other factors form nucleolus-derived foci (Hernandez-Verdun et al, 2002) . therefore, members of a subset of the nucleolar proteome act as building blocks of the nucleolus around rDna repeats, and it is formed in an incremental manner (Dundr et al, 2000) . For assembly to occur in this way, these blocks must bind to multiple partner molecules, thereby probably functioning as so-called hub proteins. a common characteristic of hub proteins is the ability to bind to 10 or more distinct proteins (Krasowski et al, 2008) . Hub proteins have been extensively studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which two types have been identified (Ekman et al, 2006) . Dynamic hub proteins are proposed to bind to different partner molecules at different times or subcellular locations, whereas static hubs interact with most partners simultaneously. traditionally, hub proteins have been thought to be important components of protein-protein inter action networks; however, the possibility that their capacity to interact with large numbers of target proteins could also have a structural role has so far been neglected. the nucleolus and other nuclear structures without membranes are dynamic, with their constituent proteins in constant flux. therefore, if a hub protein is present in one compartment in sufficient quantity, we speculate that sequential trans ient interactions between the targeted protein and multiple hub proteins could be sufficient to induce a period of residence within the compartment. Hub proteins are known to facilitate interactions with a wide range of partner proteins (Kim et al, 2008) , while retaining the ability to distinguish between suitable partners. in this case, localization works through the recognition of structural or sequence-based motifs within a protein, which make possible its identification as a protein that must be retained within a specific subcellular localization.",

Whether such proteins are dynamic or static hubs is difficult to elucidate, and they might share characteristics of the two types. For example, both proteins can form multiple stable interactions throughout the cell cycle (Fig 2) , which is a characteristic of static hubs; however, given the transitory nature of a subset of the nucleolar proteome-including ribosomal proteins, which are exported to the cytoplasm (andersen et al, 2005)-they also show characteristics of a dynamic hub protein.",

Disordered proteins tend to have larger surface-to-volume ratios than ordered ones (gunasekaran et al, 2003) , and extensive surface areas are advantageous for binding to different ligands. Disordered proteins have been shown to interact with multiple protein or nucleic-acid partners, while maintaining an overall size that is two to three times smaller than ordered proteins (gunasekaran et al, 2003) ; this characteristic is also advantageous for proteins that act as scaffolds for dense compartments such as the nucleolus, which would otherwise be considerably larger. Furthermore, disordered domains have been proposed to be involved in nucleolar protein-rna interactions (yiu et al, 2006) . the known importance of nucleolin and npM for the formation of nucleoli also supports their roles as hub proteins. as nucleoli breakdown and reform during M phase, the idea that such disruption could be controlled by affecting a small number of proteins that are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of nucleoli has obvious advantages . the ablation of either nucleolin or npM using rna interference is sufficient to disrupt the nucleolar structure, although the exact nature of the disruption varies between the two proteins (amin et al, 2008; Ma et al, 2007; ugrinova et al, 2007) . the depletion of npM results in an accumulation of SuMoylated proteins within nucleoli (yun nucleolar proteins, and other nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. This interaction map was generated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Ingenuity Systems, Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA), and shows the complexity of the interactions-many of which are interlinked-and how perturbations to one protein might affect the function of another. Examples of proteins that can traffic to the nucleolus and that are discussed in the text, such as VHL, are also shown.

            "text": "the localization of proteins to membrane-bound compartments such as the nucleus is mediated by dedicated targeting systems that recognize specific protein motifs and vary depending on protein size, hydrodynamic radius and concentration. Many proteins that traffic to and from the nucleus by the nuclear-pore complex contain one or more nuclear localization signals (nlSs) and, if necessary, also nuclear export signals (nESs). these motifs are well characterized and moderately conserved, and can therefore be predicted by suitable algorithms (cokol et al, 2000; la cour et al, 2004) . However, the motifs that are involved in regulating nucleolar localization are not well defined and it is believed that nucleolar localization of a protein results from either direct or indirect interaction with one of the nucleolar building blocks-that is, with rDna, its transcripts or protein components (carmo- Fonseca  et al, 2000) . therefore, rather than a targeting signal that acts as a recognition motif for the binding to import machinery, such signals would be responsible for high-affinity interactions with proteins or nucleic acids that reside within the nucleolus and thereby impart localization. initial support for this hypothesis came from early studies of nucleolar proteins (Schmidt-zachmann & nigg, 1993) ; for example, although nucleolin was shown to contain a nlS, no defined nolS could be identified, and it was therefore postulated that rna-binding domains that were present within nucleolin were responsible for nucleolar accumulation. Similarly, other proteins that localize to the nucleolus might do so by binding directly to dsrna, such as the nrF (niedick et al, 2004) . nucleolin has been shown to associate with npM-which contains a nolS-and therefore probably transports nucleolin to the nucleolus (li et al, 1996) . npM can also associate with the arF tumour-suppressor protein and retarget it to the nucleolus, where its function is inhibited (Korgaonkar et al, 2005) . another example of a protein that can localize to the nucleolus in the absence of a specific nolS is pp1. in this case, nucleolar localization is driven by the nolS-containing nucleolar protein noM1 (gunawardena et al, 2008) . the association with npM and other nucleolar proteins is also necessary for the trafficking and function of several viral proteins (Hiscox, 2007) such as the orF3 protein of the plant umbravirus groundnut rosette virus, which associates with fibrillarin for the formation of viral ribonucleoprotein particles, the nucleolar translocation of which is essential for infection (Kim et al, 2007) .",

Such motifs can range in size from short sequences of seven or eight amino acids to approx imately 30 residues (table 1; Birbach et al, 2004; reed et al, 2006) . For example, studies of the nolS of the human la protein and sequence alignment with other motifs indicated that the (r/K)(r/K)X(r/K) motif appeared once or as multiple copies in peptides that were targeted to the nucleolus (Horke et al, 2004) ; such motifs had been known since the discovery of nolSs in HiV-1 and cellular proteins (Hatanaka, 1990; Dang & lee, 1989) . the conjugation of defined nolSs to fluorescent proteins such as EgFp indicates that the motifs responsible for the function of a protein within the nucleolus can be distinct from those involved in nucleolar localization. For example, the nucleocapsid protein of the prrSV-which binds to viral rna-travels between the nucleolus and the cytoplasm (rowland et al, 1999; you et al, 2008) , and has separate motifs that are responsible for nolS activity and fibrillarin binding, the association to which might cause defects in rrna production (rowland et al, 2003; yoo et al, 2003) . presumably, nucleolar proteins that are above the size exclusion limit of the nuclear pore complex might also require a nlS for active transport through the nuclear envelope. this might explain why many nlSs and nolSs contain shared motifs, as genetic stability and the availability of interfaces that are accessible for interaction with the trafficking machinery would drive the selection for proximal motifs.",

            "text": "nolSs might be targets for other nucleolar proteins or rnas. in this regard, npM has been shown to interact with an artificial nolS to direct exogenous proteins to specific compartments within the nucleo lus (lechertier et al, 2007) . indeed, the fusion of the same artificial nolS with another nucleolar protein, fibrillarin-which contains its own nolS-showed that it could be retargeted from the DFc to the gc by conferring on fibrillarin high affinity for npM (lechertier et al, 2007) . this suggests that nolSs might have a hierarchal dominance in terms of directing proteins to the nucleolus and its subcompartments. Swapping nolSs between viral proteins that have different nucleolar localization and trafficking rates has certainly illustrated that the nolS can determine both of these properties, although different nolS sequences might confer the same biological activity (Emmott et al, 2008) . For example, abolishing the nolS of the orF57 protein of reviews concept HVS prevented the trafficking of intronless HVS rna from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm, yet this activity was rescued by the addition of the nolS of the HiV-1 rev protein (Boyne & Whitehouse, 2006) . Several factors might be responsible for determining the activity of nolSs. Similar to the positioning of nESs, nolSs might be situated on the exterior of the parent protein, making them available for inter action with other molecules that are thereby also targeted to the nucleo lus (Horke et al, 2004) . the activity of nolSs might also be regulated by post-translational modifications; a notable example of this is found in the nolS and nES of the HSV-1 uS11 protein, which comprises a single shared proline-rich motif the activity of whichto mediate nucleolar localization or nuclear export-is regulated by phosphoryl ation (catez et al, 2002) . this finding also emphasizes the fact that arg and lys residues are not the sole functional residues of nolSs, as is the case with npM, for which trp residues were reported to be important (nishimura et al, 2002) . the subcellular localization of npM is also controlled by SuMoylation, which occurs in close proximity to the nolS motif (liu et al, 2007) and can affect the role of npM in 28S rrna maturation (Haindl et al, 2008) .",
