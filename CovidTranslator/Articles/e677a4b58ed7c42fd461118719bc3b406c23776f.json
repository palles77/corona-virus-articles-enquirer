A pseudoknot has two stems that form a quasi-continuous helix and two connecting loops. A 1.6 \u00c5 crystal structure of the beet western yellow virus (BWYV) pseudoknot reveals rotation and a bend at the junction of the two stems. A loop base is inserted in the major groove of one stem with quadruple-base interactions. The second loop forms a new minor-groove triplex motif with the other stem, involving 2'-OH and triple-base interactions, as well as sodium ion coordination. Overall, the number of hydrogen bonds stabilizing the tertiary interactions exceeds the number involved in Watson-Crick base pairs. This structure will aid mechanistic analyses of ribosomal frameshifting.",

            "text": "In many viruses, including both tumor viruses and retroviruses, the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting of polycistronic mRNA regulates the relative level of structural and enzymatic proteins important for efficient viral assembly 1, 2 . Because of the -1 shift in reading frames, the stop codon is avoided, and a single fusion protein is produced. For example, in the Rous sarcoma retrovirus, the pol gene that encodes integrase, protease and reverse transcriptase is expressed with the upstream gag gene (encoding virus core proteins) through a gag-pol fusion protein. The mature products are later obtained by processing the poly-protein precursor 1 . The -1 frameshifting is found not only in retroviruses [3] [4] [5] but also in coronaviruses 6 , in yeast 7 and in plant viruses 8 , as well as in bacterial systems 1 . Frameshifting levels can range from 1% to over 30% in different systems to produce gene products in a functionally appropriate ratio. However, the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting is not understood. It is postulated that a complex mRNA structure six to eight nucleotides downstream from the 'slippery sequence', in many cases a pseudoknot, leads to ribosomal pausing and the simultaneous slippage of both aminoacyl and peptidyl tRNAs toward the 5' direction by one base 3 . The slippery shift site on the messenger RNA has an X XXY YYN consensus sequence (the initial reading frame is indicated, and bases X and Y can be identical). This homopolymeric sequence can maintain at least two out of three base pairs with the anticodons upon slippage 3 .",

The pseudoknot conformation originates from a hairpin structure, in which a single-stranded region folds back to pair with residues in the hairpin-loop region. The stem at the 5' end is named stem 1, and the 3' stem is stem 2. Loop 1 and loop 2 are unpaired regions that cross the major groove of stem 2 and the minor groove of stem 1, respectively 10 . Many mutational studies have been performed on frameshifting pseudoknots to correlate structure and function [4] [5] [6] [7] , and certain mutations at the junction of the two stems or loop regions can have deleterious effects on frameshifting efficiencies 11, 12 . These findings suggest that there are special structural features involving tertiary interactions in a frameshifting pseudoknot that are important for function.",

Continuous stacking of loop 2 onto A25 (magenta) of stem 2 (Fig. 2d ) and the short length of loop 1 induce the rotation of stem 2 in relation to stem 1 (Fig. 2c ). There is a 48\u00b0rotation between the bottom base of stem 2 (A25) and the top base of stem 1 (G7); therefore, they are not stacked (Fig. 2c) . The helical axes of the two stems are shifted in relation to one another and displaced by ~5 \u00c5, and the average tilt angle between the two stems is ~25\u00b0. It has been previously suggested that pseudoknots with loop lengths shorter than the minimum length required for crossing the grooves of an A-form helix may impose distortion in the stem regions 10 . The length of loop 1 is relatively short for stretching across a major groove opening between stem 1 and stem 2 that is enlarged by their relative rotation and bend (Fig. 2a,c,d) .

However, the adjacent residue (A20) is 30\u00b0out of plane from the G4-C17 base pair (Fig. 2a) , leading to a stabilizing stacking interaction with the ribose O4' of residue C5, as found in many nucleic acid structures (reviewed in ref. 22 ). This anchorlike adenosine spans the minor groove and interacts with both strands of stem 1. It is held in this position by an extensive network of seven hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3b) , using both base and sugar interactions. The 2'-OH of A20 contributes four of the hydrogen bonds by interacting with two layers of bases ( Table 2) . Two of the hydrogen bonds are bifurcated, involving O2 atoms of residues C5 and C17, resulting in the tilt of these bases (Fig. 2c) . Some of these adenosine interactions have also been seen in the crystal structures of the hammerhead ribozyme 23 and group I intron 24 . In both cases, the adenosine in an RNA tetraloop contacts the minor-groove side of a G-C base pair to form four of the seven hydrogen bonds observed here. In contrast to A20, the adenines there are not tilted and are largely in the plane of the base pair. The next two residues A21 and C22 (Fig. 2a) are somewhat rotated away from the minor groove but the bases are stacked. The backbone conformation is extended and appears to be stabilized by hydrogen bonding between bases to the 2'-OH of G16 ( Fig. 3c) and by a sodium ion that mediates base-base interactions (Fig. 5c ). The adjacent A23 is stacked on the exocyclic amino group of C22 (Fig. 3a) and utilizes its Watson-Crick face to interact with the neighboring C15 (Fig. 3d) . A24, the last base of loop 2, stacks on A23 (Fig. 3a) and interacts with guanosine G7 through three hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3e ). This minor groovespecific interaction is unlike other G-A interactions described previously [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . The junction between A24 and A25 is stabilized by a 2.82 \u00c5 hydrogen bond between the 2'-OH of A24 and the O4' of A25 (not shown). With the exception of A20, loop 2 is not involved in lattice contacts.",

In the BWYV pseudoknot, a C8-A9 sequence crosses the major groove, and the C residue is conserved in some luteovirus pseudoknots 8 . In the BWYV structure, C8 is inserted into the major groove of stem 2, forming a quadruple-base interaction with G12, A25 and C26 (Figs 2a,4a) . This is the first example of one base hydrogen bonding to three other bases, two of which form a base pair. The G12-C26 base pair has a strong propeller twist, which is needed for C26 to stack upon the tilted A25 (Figs 2c,4a) . As noted by the asterisk in Fig. 4a , the distance between N3 of C8 and O6 of G12 is 2.82 \u00c5, and it is likely that C8 is protonated in the N3 position to form a hydrogen bond. Protonation of cytosines is also found in other nucleic acid structures [31] [32] [33] . Two water molecules stabilize this core interaction by mediating the 2'-OH of C8 to base contacts (A25 and C26) (Fig. 5b) . Overall, these major groove interactions and the consecutive minorgroove triplex appear to drive the rotation and bend at the stem 1-stem 2 junction.",

In the BWYV structure, we have named the loop 1 to stem 2 transition a 'C turn' (Fig. 5a) , which has some features in common with the U turn. The 'C turn' involves the change in direction between loop 1 and the top of stem 2, through three nucleotides (C8, A9 and C10), the last C being base paired. The turn is less sharp than the 180\u00b0U turn, but is stabilized by a hydrogen bond from N4 of C10 to the phosphate oxygen of A9, which is the second phosphate in the 5' direction. In comparison, the U turn uses a uracil N3 hydrogen-bonded to the fourth phosphate group in the 3' direction. In addition, adenine 9 is partially stacked at an angle on cytosine 10, which is associated with a parallel tilting of C10, propeller twisted in relation to its base-paired G28 (Fig. 2c ). An organized network of water molecules facilitates the turn by bridging phosphate or base contacts (Fig. 5a) . The array of water molecules on the other side of loop 1 stabilizes its conformation in the major groove (Fig. 5b) .",

Pseudoknots are usually in some type of equilibrium between the folded and the unfolded form 34 , and it is likely that frameshifting occurs when the pseudoknot does not unravel during translocation. Therefore, features that stabilize the compact form of the pseudoknot may be important for function. It is notable in this regard that the BWYV pseudoknot is stabilized by more hydrogen bonds involved in tertiary interactions (26 total, Table 2 ) than those engaged in Watson-Crick base pairs (24 total). As the pseudoknot barrier induces ribosomal pausing, it is likely that the ribosome contacts both the slippery site and the pseudoknot simultaneously 36 . Continued activity of the mRNA translocation machinery probably induces deformation of the pseudoknot, transmitting the \"tug\" through stem 1 into loop 1. Understanding how the tertiary stabilized pseudoknot dynamically responds to deformation in this process may shed light on the -1 slippage mechanism.",

C8 seems to play an organizing role in assembling the junction between the stems. The junctional A25 base not only provides a continuous stacking platform into stem 2 but also plays an important role in stabilizing the C8 base-specific quadruple interactions. Probable unpairing of a junctional base pair in frameshifting pseudoknots as observed here with U13 has also been reported in several biochemical 11, 37 and NMR studies 14 . The ribosomal frameshifting efficiency of the luteovirus pseudoknot is relatively low compared to those that have different junctional sequences [4] [5] [6] . While the stabilization in loop 2 appears to be a general feature utilized by frameshifting pseudoknots, the junctional interactions may be different in high-efficiency frameshifting systems 6, 11, 12 . In those systems, the identity of the loop 1 base analogous to C8 is not crucial for frameshifting activity. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that a certain bent conformation induced by an adenosine wedged base between the two stems may also be important for high-level frameshifting 17 . Recently, a 4.8 \u00c5 crystal structure of a synthetic SELEX pseudoknot complexed with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was analyzed.

For example, three hydrogen-bonding contacts between loop 2 and stem 1 have been reported in the NMR study of a pseudoknot formed by the turnip yellow mosaic virus genomic RNA 18 . In the BWYV loop 2 conformation, the 2'-OH and certain hydrogen bond donor/acceptor groups of the adenine bases are positioned on the outside surface where they are available for higher order contact (Fig. 3a) . It is possible that this interface is recognized by proteins or can have dynamic interactions with the ribosome. An interface of this kind could also be involved in domain organization for packing of large RNA molecules 40 .

Native I data were collected at Brookhaven beamline X4A. Multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) data for the bromine and osmium derivative crystals were collected at the Brookhaven X4A and CHESS F2 beamlines, respectively. All data were collected at 100 K, and crystals were soaked in mother liquor containing 25% MPD as a cryoprotectant for 1 min before freezing. Data were processed using the programs DENZO, SCALEPACK 43 , and the CCP4 suite 44 .",

The single bromine site was located from the 2.1 \u00c5 isomorphous-dif-ference Patterson map of native II and the bromine derivative data. Five Os sites were located in the Os derivative data collected at the absorption edge by difference Fourier techniques, using the bromine phases. These sites were also confirmed in the Os anomalous-difference Patterson maps. We used a combination of multiple isomorphous-replacement and anomalous-scattering (MIRAS) methods for phasing with the program SHARP 45 . The Residual maps from SHARP revealed other characteristics of the heavy-atom sites, and the space group enantiomorph was determined. The electron density maps were greatly improved through the addition of an alternative position for the major osmium-binding site along with refinement of anisotropic temperature factors for the bromine site and the major osmium site. Using the program O (ref. 46 ), a poly(rC) model with appropriate sugar puckers was built into the solvent-flattened electron density maps generated from native II and the bromine/osmium derivative data. Using SHARP, an excellent 1.9 \u00c5 electron density map was also generated from native I and the bromine/osmium derivative data, confirming the trace, clarifying the identity of bases and revealing the position of the 5'-end \u03b2-phosphate. Initial refinement cycles were performed with X-PLOR 47 ; early observation of unaccounted density in the MIRAS maps and the later appearance of connected density in the simulated-annealing omit maps suggested two conformations of nucleotide U13 and part of the phosphate backbone of residue C14. The two conformations were included in refinement and relative occupancies calculated (C2'-endo/C3'-endo 60% : 40%). Final rounds of refinement to 1.6 \u00c5 were performed using CNS 48 , which rapidly decreased both the R-factor and R free . Bulk solvent and anisotropic temperature factor corrections were carried out in the final process. Statistics are presented in Table 1 . A high-density peak that appeared in the solvent-flattened maps was tentatively identified as a sodium ion, with the coordination distance criteria to water molecules or donors of the RNA as 2.4-2.8 \u00c5. The magnesium ion was identified by its strict octahedral coordination with ligand distances between 2.1 and 2.3 \u00c5. Helical parameters for the structure were generated by the program CURVES 49 .",
