The protein also plays roles in viral RNA transcription and/or replication and possibly viral mRNA translation. Phosphorylation is one of the most common post-translation modifications that plays important regulatory roles in modulating protein functions. It has been speculated for sometime that phosphorylation could play an important role in regulation of coronavirus N protein functions. As a first step toward positioning to address this we have identified the amino acids that are phosphorylated on the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) A59 N protein. High performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) was used to identify phosphorylated sites on the N protein from both infected cells and purified extracellular virions. A total of six phosphorylated sites (S162, S170, T177, S389, S424 and T428) were identified on the protein from infected cells. The same six sites were also phosphorylated on the extracellular mature virion N protein. This is the first identification of phosphorylated sites for a group II coronavirus N protein.",

The survey scan was acquired using the Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass analyzer, which offers high mass accuracy and resolution. A list of potential phosphorylated peptides was generated based on detected serine/threoninecontaining peptides from the N protein. For localization of phosphorylation sites a scan protocol of 1 survey scan (FTICR), followed by 7 targeted MS/MS scans (CID spectra of specified m/z values were acquired using the LTQ mass analyzer). All uninterpreted tandem MS data were searched using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK). Assignments of the phosphopeptides were confirmed by manual comparison of the tandem mass spectra with the predicted fragmentation generated in silico by the MS-Product component of ProteinProspector (http://prospector.ucsf.edu). In the case of phosphopeptides containing more than one serine or threonine, we localized phosphorylation to particular residues by assigning fragment ion masses from the mass spectra that were unique to the fragmentation of a peptide phosphorylated at said residue. Western blot analysis of parallel lanes was used to verify the identity of the N protein (right panel). A rabbit polyclonal N antibody was used to identify the N protein (Cologna et al., 2000) . (B) Sequence coverage of peptides that identified phosphorylated resides is shown. Double lines indicate coverage for both intracellular and extracellular N protein fractions. Single lines identify additional coverage of the intracellular fraction. Dots mark predicted phosphorylation sites.",

            "text": "Recently structural information became available for IBV and SARS-CoV N proteins. The three-dimensional structures are based on NMR analysis of amino acids 45-181 (Huang et al., 2004 ) and X-ray crystal structures of the amino-terminal residues of IBV 19/29-160/162 (Fan et al., 2005; Jayaram et al., 2006) and SARS-CoV 47-175 (Saikatendu et al., 2007) . Crystal structures have also been determined for carboxy-terminal residues 219-349 of IBV N (Jayaram et al., 2006) and residues 270-370 of SARS-CoV N (Yu et al., 2006) . Based solely on amino acid alignments, this corresponds to the region encompassing roughly R45-N195 in the MHV A59 N protein (Parker and Masters, 1990) . The relative positions of the phosphorylated sites identified on intracellular and extracellular virion N are shown. The positions of the RNA binding domain (Nelson et al., 2000) and putative dimerization domain (Yu et al., 2006) are noted. Eukaryotic kinases that may phosphorylate the identified sites were predicted by NetPhosK 1.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhosK/) are shown in the table below the schematic. (Fig. 8) . No structural information is yet available for MHV N, but based on the sequence alignments we can speculate about the potential positions of the phosphorylated sites on MHV N. The sites in the amino terminal region (S162, S170, T177) potentially fall within a large loop between \u2424-strands (\u24246 and \u24247 of SARS amino-terminus) (Saikatendu et al., 2007) . These sites are adjacent to the previously identified MHV RNA binding domain that extends from T177 to P231 (Figs. 7 and 8) (Nelson et al., 2000) . Localization of the phosphorylation sites near this domain could influence presentation of the RNA binding domain and in turn interaction with the RNA. Clearly, much remains to be understood about, not only the structure of the MHV N protein, but also its functional domains compared with other coronavirus nucleocapsids. RNA binding domains for IBV and SARS-CoV are located in the amino-terminal domain preceding the serine-rich domain (Fan et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2004; Saikatendu et al., 2007) . Mutagenesis of a positively charged \u2424-hairpin within the amino-terminus of IBV N identified residues involved in RNA-binding in vitro, and when introduced into an infectious clone virus replication Fig. 8 . Alignment of representative coronavirus N protein amino acid sequences. Positions of the phosphorylated sites on MHV N, conserved resides in the group II viruses BCoV, HCoV OC43 and SARS CoV, and recently identified sites on IBV (Chen et al., 2005) and TGEV (Calvo et al., 2005) N proteins are highlighted. The conserved S/R rich domains are boxed in each sequence. Sequences for MHV A59 (P03416), BCoV (P10527), HCov OC43 (Q696P4), SARS CoV (P59595), TGEV (P04134), HCoV 229E (P15130) and IBV CoV (P69596) were obtained from Swiss-Prot. The alignment was generated using ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1994). was attenuated (Tan et al., 2006) . Kinetic analysis of the amino-terminus of IBV N showed that the domain binds viral RNA, but the full length protein exhibits stronger binding, suggesting that interactions with other regions of the protein are also important (Spencer and Hiscox, 2006) . The conserved SR domain has been proposed to link the amino-terminal RNA binding and carboxy-terminal multimerization domains of IBV and SAR-CoV (Fan et al., 2005; Saikatendu et al., 2007) . All of the identified phosphorylation sites on the IBV N protein are located on the carboxy side of its SR domain. The presence of phosphorylated residues in close proximity to the MHV SR domain may uniquely influence how the surrounding domains interact with viral RNA. Modeling of other coronavirus N proteins based on the crystal forms of SARS-CoV and IBV amino-terminal domains indicate that the proteins are similar in the overall organization of \u2424-strands, but since the proteins dif-fer in their surface charge distribution patterns, it was speculated that the residues involved in RNA binding and how they interact with the RNA is different (Saikatendu et al., 2007) . In the case of MHV N, the presence of phosphorylated residues between the amino-end and the SR domain may contribute to this difference.",

The results are consistent with earlier suggestions for a potential role of N phosphorylation (Laude and Masters, 1995; Nelson et al., 2000) . Affinity for viral RNA could play a role in assembly or uncoating. Dephosphorylation of MHV N protein has been suggested to facilitate infection (Mohandas and Dales, 1991) . Virion associated kinase activity has been reported for MHV JHM, but whether it plays any role during infection is not known (Siddell et al., 1981) . Phosphorylation of N could be important in whatever role the protein plays in viral RNA transcription and/or replication. Phosphorylation may alter the structure of the N protein and in turn presentation of RNA binding domain(s) that is important for recognition of the packaging signal, transcription regulatory sequences or other signature sequences in the viral RNA(s). It was recently demonstrated that TGEV and SARS-CoV N proteins have RNA chaperone activity (Zuniga et al., 2007) . We fully agree with the suggestion that phosphorylation may have a role in this activity.",

            "text": "Samples analyzed in this study reflect steady state levels of phosphorylation for the N protein present in virus infected cells at 18 h p.i. We did not detect any difference in phosphorylation of the protein from the infected cells and that in extracellular virions. It should be noted that coronaviruses assemble at intracellular membranes in the region of the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi complex (ERGIC) (Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994) . The details of virus release are not fully understood, but virions are thought to transport through the constitutive secretory pathway after budding. Thus, the intracellular fraction in our study no doubt contained some assembled virions that had not been secreted, which would contribute to the profile of sites that were identified. Our identification of the same sites on both intracellular and virion N differs from the results from recent analysis of TGEV N as discussed above. Four sites were found to be phosphorylated on the protein from infected cells, while only two of these were identified on extracellular virion N (Calvo et al., 2005) . What accounts for the difference is not known. It may reflect a basic difference between MHV and TGEV. Calvo et al. (2005) suggested the possibility that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation could play a role in TGEV assembly. We previously suggested that a more highly phosphorylated isoform of the N protein exists in BCoV (Hogue, 1995) and MHV infected cells (Hogue, unpublished data) . We also hypothesized that nucleocapsids might undergo dephosphorylation during assembly into virions. We did not attempt to identify phosphorylation sites on different isoforms in the present study. Excised gel pieces included both forms of the protein that we previously suggested might be differentially phosphorylated based solely on phosphatase digestion results. Others have reported differences in the phosphorylation status of intracellular and virions N proteins. IBV virion N protein was reported to be more phosphorylated than the protein in virus infected cells (Jayaram et al., 2005) .",
