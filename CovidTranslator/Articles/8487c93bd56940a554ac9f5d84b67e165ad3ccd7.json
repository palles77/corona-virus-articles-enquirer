The basic principle for disease control and prevention is the same no matter where it is acquired. But target groups who need to know differ. The precautionary information should be communicated to travelers with the risk assessed properly. Of course rapid detection of cases can lead to rapid response and early containment and finally to prevention of indigenous transmission of exotic pathogens. In this respect, effective infectious disease surveillance is essential. In this study it was not difficult to overview the situation of imported infectious diseases because the current Japanese surveillance system requires the presumptive place of infection including the specified country if possible. But there have been no studies on the evaluation of reporting rate. Before April 1999 when the infectious disease control law was revised, 50e80 cases of malaria were reported annually in the framework of the old infectious disease prevention law, but the Research Group on Chemotherapy of Tropical Diseases reported by their field investigation that approximately 120 patients have been confirmed with malaria annually. 12 It means that cases notified to the Ministry of Health and Welfare were about 50% in those days. Reports of malaria peaked in 2000 one year after the new law enactment and steadily decreased to the same level before 1999. On the other hand, Dengue fever is increasing. It is not possible to determine whether the reporting rate of malaria has decreased recently or not, it will be necessary to evaluate the surveillance system including assessment of missed opportunity for diagnosis and treatment. It might be better to report febrile illness with travel history abroad for effective detection and evaluation.",
