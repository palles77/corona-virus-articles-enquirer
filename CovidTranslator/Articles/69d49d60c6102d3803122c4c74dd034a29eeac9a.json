In Singapore, 49% healthcare workers during the SARS outbreak experienced social stigmatization because of their jobs (Koh et al., 2005) . In a similar vein, Korean nurses working at hospitals with MERS-CoV patients were distanced by from their significant others (e.g., family or friends) and prohibited from using elevators at their apartments, and even their children were not allowed to attend kindergartens and schools (Jung & Cho, 2015) .",

There is also rare empirical evidence of stigma among primary healthcare providers during the SARS outbreak in Singapore (Verma et al., 2004) . Stigma was also considered as a source of perceived stress (Crocker, Major, & Steele, 1998; R\u0171sch et al., 2009) . Consistent with this, previous studies have found stigma to be related to stress not only in people living with infectious disease (Charles et al., 2012) but also in the nurses caring for them (Hernandez, Morgan, & Parshall, 2016) . Considering that perceived stress is well known to a predictor of mental health (Gomes, Faria, & Lopes, 2016; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) , stigma may indirectly influence mental health via stress. With a similar perspective, Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, and Link (2013) noticed that stress might mediate the linkage of stigma to health outcomes. Based on all of these findings, it was proposed in the present study that stigma exerts both direct effects on mental health and also indirect (mediated) effects on mental health via stress in nurses caring for patients with MERS-CoV.",

Previous studies have found, hardy nurses to have better mental health (Gito, Ihara, & Ogata, 2013; Woo & Suh, 2008) , and that hardiness is inversely related to stress (McCalister, Dolbier, Webster, Mallon, & Steinhardt, 2006; Soderstrom, Dolbier, Leiferman, & Steinhardt, 2000) . It might therefore also be conjectured that the personal characteristic of hardiness influences mental health directly and also indirectly via stress.

Nurses working at these hospitals were required to care for patients diagnosed with the disease or suspected of having the disease. Previous studies have found that staff nurses working at hospitals treating patients with infectious diseases (e.g., SARS and MERS-CoV) suffer from deteriorated mental health (Chen et al., 2005; Khalid et al., 2016) . In a similar vein, the mental health score in the present study was worse than those of shift-work nurses (Kim, 2004) and scrub nurses (Jung, 2002) working at university hospitals not associated with a novel infectious disease in South Korea when their mental health was measured using the same instrument.",

The present study has identified how stigma is linked to the mental health of nurses working at a hospital treating patients with the MERS-CoV-stigma was related to mental health not only directly but also indirectly via stress. The direct linkage between stigma and mental health was Fig. 1 . Statistical diagram of a simple mediation model with two independent variables. a 1 , a 2 , b, c 1 , and c 2 : unstandardized regression coefficients; e 1 and e 2 : unexplained parts of stress and mental health, respectively. Two regression models: stress = constrant 1 + a 1 \u00b7stigma + a 2 \u00b7hardiness + e 1 ; mental health = constrant 2 + c 1 \u00b7stigma + c 2 \u00b7hardiness + b\u00b7stress + e 2 Indirect effect of stigma on mental health through stress was a 1 \u00d7 b, and the direct effect was c 1 ; indirect effect of hardiness on mental health through stress was a 2 \u00d7 b, and the direct effect was c 2 . congruent with the findings of an investigation of a SARS outbreak (Verma et al., 2004) . The indirect linkage was similarly supported by stigma having a mediation effect on depression through stress in people with disabilities (Shin, Lee, Kim, & Lee, 2011) . From these findings, it is suggested that hospital administrators and policymakers should make efforts to ensure that nurses do not suffer from infectious-disease-related stigma (e.g., social rejection, prejudice, or discrimination) during the early stages of an epidemic. This might result in the nurses perceiving less stress and maintaining better mental health, enabling them to concentrate on caring for their patients.",

The hardiness of nurses working in such settings was reported as an important direct predictor of their mental health (Harrison, Loiselle, Duquette, & Semenic, 2002; Lambert, Lambert, Petrini, Mei, & Zhang, 2007) . This is consistent with the findings of the present study involving nurses working at hospitals treating patients with the MERS-CoV; this study is the first to investigate the hardiness of nurses working at hospitals treating patients with novel contagious diseases. In this study hardiness was also found to indirectly influence mental health via stress. Such a partial mediation effect of hardiness on a health outcome via stress was also found in a study of employees working in a corporate environment in the USA (Soderstrom et al., 2000) . This personal trait of hardiness can be enhanced by ongoing education (Judkins, Massey, & Huff, 2006) . It is therefore recommended to develop an educational program that strengthens the personal characteristics of commitment, control, and challenge among nurses.",

A mediation effect refers to how an independent variable influences a dependent variable through a mediator (Field, 2013) . The first strength of this study was therefore in identifying the mechanism underlying how stigma and hardiness influence the mental health of nurses working at hospitals treating patients with the MERS-CoV. The second strength was that a simple partial-mediation model of the influences of stigma and hardiness on mental health via stress was assessed using the powerful approach of bootstrapping. The most widely used approach is that suggested by Baron and Kenny (1986) , but that approach has been criticized as having a low statistical power (Field, 2013; MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, & Sheets, 2002 ). An alternative is the Sobel test, which requires the assumption that the indirect effect is normally distributed (Hays, 2009 ). However, the distribution actually tends to exhibit skewness and kurtosis (Edwards & Lambert, 2007) . Currently the most powerful approach for a mediating-effect model involves the application of bootstrapping, which provides the advantage of not needing to make any assumptions about the sampling distribution (Hays, 2009) .",

However, there is no such instrument related to the MERS-CoV for nurses. The present study is the first to develop a scale for the stigma perceived by nurses related to the MERS-CoV, and the scale satisfies content validity, factorial-construct validity, and internal consistency reliability. Future studies should evaluate other psychometric properties of the scale, such as its convergent/discriminant validity, knowngroups validity, and test-retest reliability. This instrument may also be suitable for application by infection control nurses or other healthcare providers at community health centers.",
