We demonstrate this principle with the detection of five viral pathogens; Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis C virus, West Nile Virus, Human Immune Deficiency virus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus. Oligonucleotides are designed complementary to a target sequence of interest containing a 3\u2032 universal fluorescence dye. A 5\u2032 thiol causes the oligonucleotides to self-assemble onto the metal nanowire. The single-stranded oligonucleotide contains a self-complementary hairpin stem sequence of 10 bases that forces the 3\u2032 fluorophore to come into contact with the metallic nanowire surface, thereby quenching the fluorescence. Upon addition of target DNA, there is hybridization with the complementary oligonucleotides. The resulting DNA hybrid is rigid, unfolds the hairpin structure, and causes the fluorophore to be moved away from the surface such that it is no longer quenched. By using differently encoded nanowires, each conjugated with a different oligonucleotide sequence, multiplexed DNA assays are possible using a single fluorophore, from a multiplexed RT-PCR reaction.",

            "text": "Molecular beacons (1) , which comprise looped DNA structures with fluorophores and quenchers attached to each end of a sequence, have proven extremely valuable for real-time sensing of DNA in solution, including the detection of pathogens (2) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (3). In the \"dark\" state, the loop-induced proximity of the DNA termini lead to fluorescence quenching; the presence of DNA complementary to the loop sequence leads to an extended, \"bright\" conformation. Multiplexed DNA detection is possible with molecular beacons (3, 4) , but is limited by the number of spectrally distinct fluorophores available, as well as by the need to synchronize the optical properties of the fluorophore and quencher. Encoded substrates used to immobilize molecular beacons for multiplexing have also been reported; however, a quencher is still required in these systems (5) (6) (7) . Gold nanoparticles, which have novel and tunable optical properties, can serve as quenchers (8, 9) , and recently this approach has been extended to macroscopic gold surfaces (10) (11) (12) . However, these approaches do not obviate the need for multiple fluorophores. We describe herein a powerful new approach to multiplexed beacons based on the use of striped, encoded gold and silver nanowires (13) (14) (15) as quenchers, thereby allowing both encoding and quenching to be achieved using a nanoparticle This method allows multiplexed DNA assays to be carried out using a single fluorophore without the need for a quencher. In this paper we demonstrate feasibility via the simultaneous detection of five pathogens from a multiplexed RT-PCR reaction. Moreover, the availability of over 1000 different uniquely identifiable striping patterns would allow beacon-based detection of DNA sequences to be extended to arbitrarily high levels of multiplexing, using this nanowire system.",

In this seminal paper the molecular beacon comprised a fluorophore reporter dye and a nonfluorescent quencher chromophore. In close proximity, the fluorophore is quenched by the energy transfer to the nonfluorescent chromophore. Separating the fluorophore and the quencher results in a fluorescent signal. Molecular beacons have been attached to various supports for biosensor applications (6, 16, 17) . For example, Steemers et al. (6) demonstrated a fiber optic bead array for parallel detection of three DNA targets, while Wang et al. (17) arrayed five molecular beacon probes having various degrees of complementarity to a single target sequence. Tan and co-workers (16) have used an array format to optimize surface probe attachment chemistry and other experimental variables.",

Therefore, when molecular beacon probes are attached to metallic surfaces, the surface can provide fluorescence quenching, and no organic quencher dye is required. The presence of metals provides alternative nonradiative energy decay paths that can change the fluorescence quantum yield of a fluorophore. At close distances (<50 \u00c5) fluorescence is quenched and at intermediate distances (75-100 \u00c5), it is enhanced (19) . A number of groups have used this phenomenon in a biological assay. Perez-Luna et al. (12) have used a gold surface to quench fluorescence of bound molecules and detected emission after displacement in a competitive immunoassay. Others have attached fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides to gold and silver surfaces, to demonstrate proof of principle for nucleic acid assays. Du et al. (10) demonstrated quenching of hairpin DNA sequences attached to a planar gold surface, to mimic a microarray experiment, and successfully distinguished two DNA sequences, and more recently expanded this work to investigate the thermodynamic and kinetic response of the sensor (11) . Dubretret et al. (9) used a hairpin loop beacon probe structure on 1.4 nm gold particles, while Maxwell et al. (8) showed that even unstructured oligonucleotide probes could be employed. Fluorescence from the unstructured probes could be quenched because, when oligonucleotides are single stranded, they have flexibility and can form looped structures due to their attraction to the gold surface. In addition, the fluorescent dyes will reversibly absorb onto colloidal silver and gold (22, 23) . Upon hybridization the double-stranded DNA is rigid such that the fluorescent dye cannot reach the surface.",

The fluorescence from each nanowire is the mean of the pixels constituting that region of that particle in an image. Typically 25 images are taken in a single well of a microplate. Data analysis of multiplexed assays, which are comprised of multiple nanowire striping patterns for each molecular beacon probe, is done by analyzing the log-mean fluorescence across nanowires of the same striping pattern. For all assays, a single or duplicate well is reserved for ascertaining background fluorescence values for each nanowire striping pattern conjugated to its respective molecular beacon probe. A multiple of this value is subtracted from the log-normal mean fluorescence in each target assay. Error bars in all barplots correspond to confidence intervals at p = 0.95 and are representative of interassay error. Specifically, Cox's method (25) was used to determine confidence intervals from log-normal fit distributions across histograms of mean-fluorescence intensity of nanowires of the same striping pattern. In the case of duplicate assay wells, the log-normal histogram was generated by combining nanowires of the same striping pattern across duplicate wells. Figure 1A shows a cartoon representation of the molecular beacon assay, while Fig. 1B shows representative experimental images. The assay works as follows: Oligonucleotides are designed that are complementary to the target sequence, and contain a self-complementary hairpin stem sequence of 10 bases. They are labeled with a universal fluorescence dye at the 3\u2032 end (in this case TAMRA), and a thiol at the 5\u2032 end. The 5\u2032 thiol will cause the oligonucleotides to self-assemble onto the metal nanowire. Each nanowire library member is functionalized with a different oligonucleotide sequence. The single-stranded oligonucleotide contains a hairpin stem sequence that forces the 3\u2032 fluorophore to come into contact with the metallic nanowire surface, thereby quenching the fluorescence. Upon addition of target DNA, there is hybridization with the complementary oligonucleotides.",

Upon analysis with a fluorescence microscope one nanowire library member will appear fluorescent and the other nanowire will be dark. Decoding of the nanowire striping pattern indicates which DNA sequence was present. 1. (A) Cartoon description of assay. Oligonucleotides are designed with a 3\u2032 fluorophore and a 5\u2032 thiol modification. Nanowire library member # 1 is conjugated with oligonucleotide sequence A, via the thiol modification. Nanowire library member # 2 is conjugated with oligonucleotide sequence B, via the thiol modification. The oligonucleotides contain a 10 base hairpin structure, which forces the fluorophore in contact with the metallic nanowire, quenching the dye. Upon addition of target DNA complementary to sequence A, there is hybridization with the complementary oligonucleotides conjugated to nanowire library member # 1.The resulting DNA hybrid causes the fluorophore to be moved away from the surface, such that it is no longer quenched. Upon analysis with a fluorescence microscope, nanowire library member # 1 appears fluorescent and nanowire library member # 2 is not. While this assay is conceptually straightforward and elegant, a number of fundamental measurements were required to determine the optimum design for the assay. Preliminary results into the investigation of thiol position on the probe indicated that 5\u2032 thiol gave superior results over a 3\u2032 thiol. We believe this may be due to the higher purity of 5\u2032 thiol oligonucleotides, because they are easier to synthesize. In addition, during the course of these experiments we chose to work with nanowires containing similar amounts of gold and silver; however, experiments showed minimal difference in the quenching with different striped particles (results not shown).

We designed an oligonucleotide sequence complementary to the HCV 5\u2032 UTR region, and varied the 3\u2032 fluorophore, using Cy5, FITC, Texas Red, Rhodamine 6G (R6G), and TAMRA. Complementary target oligonucleotides was added to determine the quenching efficiency, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 . Quenching efficiency is calculated as (1 -[signal from negative control/signal with added target]) %. FITC and R6G had the poorest quenching efficiency at 62% and 72%, respectively. Cy5 had a quenching efficiency of 87%, Texas Red had a quenching efficiency of 94%, and TAMRA had a quenching efficiency of 89%. Dubretret et al. (9) reported quenching efficiencies for FITC, R6G, Texas Red, and Cy5 when using 1.4 nm gold nanoparticles, which all quenched with greater than 98% efficiency. We postulate that the slight quenching efficiency differences between our results and those of Dubretret et al. (9) are due to the nanowires being more representative of a planar surface, such that steric hindrance is likely a greater issue than on small (1.4 nm) spherical nanoparticles. In addition, we are using a fluorescence microscope with filters to collect data (rather than a spectrometer), such that any shift in wavelengths of absorbance or emission would impact our data, compared to data collected using a fluorimeter. While both Texas Red and TAMRA gave good results in the nanowire experiments, we selected TAMRA as the candidate for all subsequent experiments due to commercial availability.",

Three probes were designed to the HCV 5\u2032 UTR region, which were 34, 44, and 54 bases in length. They each contained a common 10 base \"stem\" sequence such that the pathogen sequence composed 24, 34, and 44 bases of the entire probe sequences. Three corresponding target oligonucleotides were designed that were 24, 34, and 44 bases in length and were complete matches to the three oligonucleotide probes (but did not contain the 10 base stem sequence). In Fig. 3 , open diamonds represent signal from experiments in which each of the three different length probe sequences were hybridized with the 24mer target sequence. The filled triangles represent signal from the negative controls, in which no target was added. The results show that, under the assembly conditions used for this experiment, the shortest probe (34mer) gave the greatest signal and discrimination between on and off. To rule out the possibility that the target length and not the probe length was a factor in the quenching efficiency, an assay was performed in which the probe and target lengths were equal. These data are represented in Fig. 3 by filled square symbols. In this experiment 34mer probe was hybridized with 24mer target, 44mer probe was hybridized with 34mer target, and 54mer probe was hybridized with 44mer target. Again, the shortest probe:target combination was found to give the best discrimination between on and off. Note that all probes were attached under identical conditions; therefore, while we anticipate some differences in probe surface density and hybridization efficiency between these samples based on steric considerations (26) , the trend indicates that the shortest probe:target combination gives the best discrimination. Interestingly the shortest probe:target comination also gave the largest signal, possibly due to the ability of the longer hybrids being able to interact with the surface in some manner. It is also important to note that it is likely both probe length and probe secondary structure play a part in the data. All subsequent experiments were performed with 34mer probes (of which the 10 base stem was included in the 34 bases).",

Single-stranded PCR material was generated by incorporating a phosphate on the 5\u2032 end of the 5\u2032 PCR primer and using lambda exonuclease to digest away the phosphorylated 5\u2032 strand, leaving the nonphosphorylated 3\u2032 strand for hybridization to the sequence specific oligonucleotide probe.

This assay offers high selectivity due to the leveraging of DNA secondary structure, and requires no instrumentation beyond a fluorescence microscope that is already present in many laboratories and first responder units. We have applied this approach to the simultaneous detection of five pathogens; HAV, HCV, WNV, HIV, and SARS, from a multiplexed RT-PCR reaction. It should be noted that this assay can be adapted to a plate format for use in a high-throughput setting. The ability to multiplex beyond the 5-plex assay presented in this paper is attainable; we have recently completed the synthesis of a 1000-member nanowire library. In addition, work continues on this assay format, to improve sensitivity and specificity and to increase multiplexing.
