An ultrasonic nebulizer was used to produce virus-containing droplets from artificial saliva to emulate those from coughing and sneezing. The operating conditions were determined by adjusting various parameters to achieve loading density and uniformity requirements. The count median diameter and mass median diameter were 0.5-2 and 3-4 mm, respectively, around the loading location when 35% relative humidity was applied. The average loading density was $ 2 \u00c2 10 3 plaque-forming units/cm 2 for 5-min loading time with a virus titer of 10 7 plaque-forming units/mL. Six different filtering facepiece respirators from commercial sources were loaded to evaluate uniform distribution. For each of the six FFRs, the virus loading uniformity within a sample and across numerous samples was 19.21% and 12.20%, respectively. This system supports a standard method for loading viable bioaerosols onto specimen surfaces when different decontamination techniques are to be compared.",

However, using medical masks and N95 FFRs as countermeasures for bioaerosols has not been demonstrated to provide a complete response: (1) although using surgical masks and N95 FFRs for tuberculosis has been shown to meet CDC guidelines, the same is not true for viral agents such as the swine flu virus.",

To qualify a method to decontaminate an FFR for reuse, one must provide a statistically robust demonstration that the technologies applied do not alter the mechanical properties of the FFR, do not leave any toxic byproduct on the FFR, and achieve at least four-log virucidal efficacy on the materials of construction of the FFR. However, no protocol has been reported for such decontamination testing, a consequence of two main limitations. First, no standard test method has been reported for simulating bioaerosol contamination of the FFRs. Second, the unique properties of bioaerosols generated by respiratory secretions can be expected to affect the efficacy of the decontamination process, and the window of operating conditions affording controlled and consistent properties is not known. Therefore, development and validation of methods that are representative of human respiratory secretions is a necessary condition before one can realistically evaluate techniques for decontamination.",

            "text": "Influenza is commonly thought to be transmitted by three mechanisms (droplet, contact, and aerosol (droplet nuclei)) (CDRF, 2006) . Some diseases (e.g., tuberculosis) are known to be mainly transmitted by the droplet nuclei route, whereas droplet transmission is considered by many to be the dominant route for some other diseases (e.g., mumps), although the actual routes are still being debated (Fiegel, Clarke, & Edwards, 2006; Tellier, 2006; Yang et al., 2007) . Salgado, Farr, Hall, and Hayden (2002) suggested different roles in influenza between droplet and aerosol transmission. Influenza is mainly spread through droplet transmission by coughing and sneezing from infectious people, while aerosol transmission is important for long-distance and sporadic infection. An infected human can be a source of large droplets generated by coughing and sneezing. During airborne transmission, these droplets will shrink in size with the consequence that both droplets and droplet nuclei contact surfaces. Although many researchers have examined the droplet size generated from humans, the actual size is not clear. Yang et al. (2007) reported that most droplets from coughing, sneezing, and talking have diameter between 1 and 20 mm, and these droplets may contract depending on the humidity and medium generated. Viruses in these droplets can aggregate with each other or be encased by the saliva component, both enhancing persistence of viability. Meanwhile, viability of viruses in saliva can be attenuated by an enzyme action (Diaz-Arnold & Marek, 2002) . Therefore, it is important that the transmission medium be factored into the design of the test method.",

The titer was prepared by adding 0.3 mL virus stock suspension into 30 mL artificial saliva. The droplets from the ultrasonic nebulizer after passing the distributor entered the chamber through six inlets.

For this study, the frequency of the generator was 2.4 MHz and the environmental conditions were 20 72 1C and 35 75%. Low RH was chosen because the survivability of MS2 is high under this condition.

The loading density was controlled by adjusting the loading time and the titer of the virus suspension. To evaluate how viability of the virus is influenced by the ultrasonic process, bioaerosols produced at different times were collected by a Biosampler and their viability was compared. The turntable speed was varied to determine its relationship with uniformity. Flow rate and mucin loading were also varied to investigate their effects on the consistency of delivered droplets. Three runs were carried out for each set of conditions. After loading with virus, each filter sample was cut into four equal quarters. Each quarter was immersed in 25 mL of extraction medium in a 50-mL conical tube. A 0.25 M glycine solution was applied to extract MS2 from the quarter sample with agitation by a wrist-action shaker (Model 75, Burrell Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa.) at a 101 angle for 15 min to analyze the loading density (these conditions showed the best extraction efficiency in preliminary testing).

The results present no significant difference in virus viability between 0 and 30 min (p = 0.10) (data not shown). Apparently, the heat shock from ultrasonic vibration did not cause damage to the MS2 in the reservoir during droplet generation. To determine the effect of ultrasonication on virus during droplet generation, viability of the viruses collected in the BioSampler after 5 and 10 min of generation was examined. The theoretical concentration in the BioSampler after 5 min of nebulization is 3 \u00c2 10 5 PFU/mL when the virus titer in the reservoir is 1.0 \u00c2 10 7 PFU/mL. The 5-min time-weighted (0-5 and 5-10 min) average concentration of collected viruses in the BioSampler was approximately 3.2 \u00c2 10 5 PFU/mL, which is similar to the theoretical value. As demonstrated, the ultrasonic nebulizer can be used to produce droplets containing MS2 virus without adverse effects on viability. Fig. 2a displays the virus loading density as a function of loading time and Fig. 2b shows the loading density as a function of the viral titer. As shown, the loading density had a linear relationship with time and with virus titer in the nebulization medium, as expected based on the initial viability tests. The results show that these two parameters can be adjusted to acquire a desired loading density. It should be noted that in determining the loading density the extracted fraction was assumed to be 1; however, different types of FFRs will have different values that depend on the material property and structure.",

The difference among the six positions was not statistically significant (p = 0.73) for flat-sheet glass-fiber filters. The reason for this uniformity is likely because settling is the dominant mechanism for large droplets in our system and a six-port distributor delivered the bioaerosols. A straight fog stream was observed through the front window during the loading. Therefore, the turntable speed was not an important parameter to meet the uniformity criteria when the flatsheet filter was employed.

As shown, the droplet size is independent of the flow rate. The gentle airflow within 1-3 Lpm just carries the aerosol away from the liquid surface. However, at a higher flow rate, the larger volume of dry dilution air promotes evaporation, and therefore results in a smaller droplet size. To generate droplets of other sizes, the frequency can be adjusted. For example, droplets are expected to be 12.1 and 6.6 times larger, respectively, when lower frequencies of 60 or 150 kHz are used instead of 2.4 MHz (Lang, 1962) . The mucin concentration also plays an important role in determining the initial droplet size because it affects surface tension and density of the artificial saliva used. Mucin at 0.3% was chosen for the artificial saliva in this study to match the protein content in human saliva. Increasing the mucin concentration threefold would reduce the median size to 40% of its original size because of the decrease in surface tension. In summary, the droplet size can be controlled by adjusting the composition of the spray medium, the frequency of the ultrasonic generator, and the flow rate.",

The MMDs for droplets generated and loaded were 9.2 and 3.2 mm, respectively, with corresponding CMDs of 3.4 and 1.8 mm, which are similar to the droplet size reported in the literature (Yang et al., 2007; Morawska et al. 2009 ) to have been generated by humans. The droplet's residence time is 0.13 s when settling is considered the main mechanism acting in this chamber. The droplet's theoretical lifetime at 35% RH is around 0.15 s, which means that droplets just reaching the FFR are almost completely evaporated. The size of a completely evaporated droplet can be calculated according to Eq. (3) where d p is the diameter of the aerosol particle and F v is the volume fraction of solid material in the suspension in the nebulizer. For 0.3% mucin, the volume fraction is 2.08 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 2 , so d p is calculated to be 2.6 mm when d d is 9.2 mm. The reason the measured value is higher than the theoretical value is an incomplete evaporation. After running the experiment, we noted that the filter surface was slightly damp, which is consistent with the above interpretation. Fig. 6 .

The flexible nature of the FFRs makes it difficult to achieve deposition on the same spot with the same shape each time. Therefore, a holding medium is necessary to achieve low CV values. Even for fixed-form FFRs, some inherently cannot produce equal quarters because the shape is not symmetric. Operational variation while cutting the sample (e.g., uneven quarters) can also contribute to larger CV values. Consequently, the CV for Q-T-Q was higher than that for S-T-S over all FFRs. It is possible to use circular areas punched from an FFR so that the difference in shape will not influence the results. However, this was outside the scope of the study, which aimed to evaluate decontamination effectiveness using an entire FFR. Nevertheless, the average CVs for both Q-T-Q and S-T-S for all FFRs were lower than the criteria -20% and 40%, respectivelydemonstrating the system's ability to consistently load the test agents. Table 2 also displays the results of the loading densities. As shown, all sets had sufficient quantity to meet the threshold criteria.",

Fig. 7 shows the extraction efficiency of three different FFRs at various extraction times. Different layer structures and properties of the FFRs are responsible for the differences as discussed. The shape of the FFR is another reason for differences in loading density. The loading density reported in Table 2 was calculated based on the FFR's projected area. The FFR, having a duck-bill shape, showed a lower loading density owing to its different curvature. As shown, both factors can affect loading density. Nevertheless, the loading density can be easily met in a controlled fashion using the specified conditions, and can be conveniently increased by adjusting the loading time, virus titer, or both.",

The respective CVs for S-T-S and Q-T-Q for the six NIOSH-certified FFRs tested were 8.57 and 13.89, lower than the criteria -20% and 40%, respectively. The droplet size can be altered by tuning the frequency of the ultrasonic nebulizer, by changing the composition of the dispersion aerosolized, and by adjusting the temperature and RH inside the chamber. Droplets emulating bioaerosols released during coughing and sneezing can be produced using specific conditions and the loading density can be achieved by controlling the loading time and the virus titer in the nebulization medium. This system allows for development and validation of a standard method for loading bioaerosol challenges when different decontamination techniques are to be compared. It also has utility for loading surfaces to study fomite transmission and reaerosolization of particles from surfaces. It can be further applied to generate and load droplets and aerosols of different sizes and to load onto materials other than FFRs. valuable comments on the design of the delivery chamber and to the Major Analytical Instrumentation Center, Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Florida for providing the SEM.
