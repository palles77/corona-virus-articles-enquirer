            "text": "Arbidol is a potent broad-spectrum antiviral molecule for the treatment and prophylaxis of many viral infections. Viruses that can be inhibited by arbidol include enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, RNA and DNA viruses, as well as pH-independent and pH-dependent ones. These differences in viral types highlight the broad spectrum of Arb antiviral activity and, therefore, it must affect a common viral critical step. Arbidol incorporates rapidly into biological membranes, and some of its antiviral effects might be related to its capacity to interact with and locate into the membrane. However, no information is available of the molecular basis of its antiviral mechanism/s. We have aimed to locate the protonated (Arp) and unprotonated (Arb) forms of arbidol in a model membrane system. Both Arb and Arp locate in between the hydrocarbon acyl chains of the phospholipids but its specific location and molecular interactions differ from each other. Whereas both Arb and Arp average location in the membrane palisade is a similar one, Arb tends to be perpendicular to the membrane surface, whereas Arp tends to be parallel to it. Furthermore, Arp, in contrast to Arb, seems to interact stronger with POPG than with POPC, implying the existence of a specific interaction between Arp, the protonated from, with negatively charged phospholipids. This data would suggest that the active molecule of arbidol in the membrane is the protonated one, i.e., the positively charged molecule. The broad antiviral activity of arbidol would be defined by the perturbation it exerts on membrane structure and therefore membrane functioning.",

Arbidol is also licensed for the treatment of rotavirus infection. Viruses that can be inhibited by arbidol include enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, RNA and DNA viruses, as well as pH-independent and pH-dependent ones. Arbidol therefore exhibits a broad and potent antiviral activity against a number of viruses which include viruses such as adenovirus, avian coronavirus, avian viruses, Chikungunya virus, Coxsackie virus B5, Hantaan virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, infectious bronchitis virus, influenza, poliovirus, and reovirus, among others (Brooks et al. 2012; Delogu et al. 2011; Deng et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2013; Perfetto et al. 2014; Shi et al. 2007; Zhong et al. 2009 ). Very recently other viruses such as Ebola virus, Tacarive arenavirus and human herpes virus 8 have been also shown to be inhibited in vitro by Arbidol (Pecheur et al. 2016 ). These differences in viral types undoubtedly highlight the broad spectrum of arbidol antiviral activity as well as that it must affect a common critical step in viral entry, fusion, and/or replication.",

It has been found previously that arbidol displays interfacial properties in membranes and intercalates in the phospholipid palisade structure of the membrane (Teissier et al. 2011b; Villalain 2010) . Interestingly, arbidol interaction with membranes is more pronounced at acidic pH, i.e., the pH required for the crucial fusion step of several enveloped viruses (Pecheur et al. 2007; Teissier et al. 2011a ). The molecule of arbidol has the capacity of forming hydrogen bonds with phospholipid molecules, having four possible acceptor groups and one possible donor group. At the same time, arbidol is a weak base which could be protonated when inserted in the membrane giving place to a positively charged molecule ( Fig. 1) (Boriskin et al. 2008; Pecheur et al. 2007 ). Therefore, arbidol could be present in the membrane in two different species, protonated (Arp), and un-protonated (Arb). Arb/Arp interacts and modifies the physico-chemical properties of membrane phospholipids, more significantly on negatively charged phospholipids than on zwitterionic ones, suggesting that the active molecule of arbidol in the membrane is the protonated one, i.e., the positively charged molecule (Villalain 2010) . Therefore, Arb/Arp could perturb membrane structure depending on the relative proportion of the protonated and un-protonated forms in the membrane.",

Molecular dynamics can be used to probe the dynamics, interaction, structure, and location of different types of molecules inserted in biological model membranes (Ingolfsson et al. 2014) . The fact that Arb/Arp mode of action is most likely through membrane interaction, it seems reasonable to think that its mode of action might be at least partly attributable to its specific effect on the membrane structure, its specific interactions with particular lipid molecules and, last but not least, its location and orientation inside the membrane. Therefore, we have used a model membrane composed of two different phospholipids, a zwitterionic one, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and a negatively charged one, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-snglycero-3-phospho-(1 0 -rac-glycerol (POPG). Our results support an interfacial location of Arb/Arp in the membrane, the existence of specific interactions with phospholipids and interestingly, Arb and Arp orientate differently in the membrane, facts that could explain, at least in part, some of its very interesting biological effects.",

The TIP3P model was used for water (Ozu et al. 2013) . All simulations were carried out with a constant number of particles as an NPT ensemble at 1.0 atm and 310 K. The time step was 2 fs. Constant pressure was maintained by the Nos\u00e9-Hoover Langevin piston method (Feller et al. 1995; Martyna et al. 1994) . Constant temperature was maintained by Langevin dynamics with a damping coefficient c of 0.5 ps -1 . The standard particle mesh Ewald method was used with periodic boundary conditions to calculate the long-range electrostatic interaction of the systems. Non-bonded interactions were cut-off after 12 \u00c5 with a smoothing function applied after 10 \u00c5 (Patra et al. 2003) . Prior to simulation and in order to remove unfavorable atomic contacts, the membrane model systems were previously equilibrated for 1 ns after 50,000 steps of minimization. The production trajectory of the lipid systems was calculated for 175 ns. All simulations were conducted under electrostatically neutral environment with an appropriate number of sodium ions.",

            "text": "We have used a lipid bilayer model composed of 128 lipid molecules (64 lipids in each leaflet) in a rectangular box. It was comprised 16 molecules of cholesterol, 80 molecules of POPC, and 32 molecules of POPG surrounded by 5559 molecules of water. Thus the relationship POPC/POPG/ Chol was 5:2:1. The solvent-to-lipid ratio was *43, i.e., excess water (Murzyn et al. 2001) . Figure 1 presents the structures and carbon numbering of the molecules considered in this study, the un-protonated form of arbidol, Arb, the protonated from of arbidol, Arp, POPC, and POPG. The bilayer lied in the xy plane, and the bilayer normal was parallel to the z-axis. Initially the simulation box had the dimensions of 8.9 nm in the x-and y-directions and 8 nm in the z-direction. The height of the simulation box and the cross-sectional area were allowed to vary independently of each other. Each water layer had an average dimension of 5.4 \u00c5 between membranes due to periodic boundary conditions. Arb/Arp was generated and minimized using Discovery Studio 4.0 software (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, USA). As it is well known, phosphatidylcholine is the dominant lipid species in biological membranes, cholesterol is omnipresent in many types of membranes giving them unique biophysical properties, and phosphatidylglycerol provides negative charge at the membrane surface (van Meer et al. 2008) . From the negatively charged diacylglycerol-phospholipids that could be selected, i.e., PA, PG, and PS, we have chosen PG. PG's have almost identical phase transition properties as zwitterionic PC's with the same length fatty acid chains. Moreover, PG's are one of the most studied negatively charged phospholipids by biophysical methods. PA, similarly to PG, has one negative charge but its biophysical properties are significantly different. PS, in contrast to both PG and PA, has three charges, two negative and one positive, and its biophysical properties, compared to PC, are different. Being POPC and POPG the phospholipid molecules used in this work, the palmitoyl chain located in the sn-1 position is completely saturated, whereas the oleoyl chain located in the sn-2 position contains a cis double bond between the C9 and C10 carbons (see Fig. 1 for acyl chain numbering). The presence of the oleoyl chain in the sn-2 position increases the overall mobility of the hydrocarbon chains of the phospholipids and hence fluidity in the xy plane of the membrane. The lipid membrane models, including water, POPC, POPG, and cholesterol, were prepared using the Charmm-Gui web server (http://www.charmm-gui.org, Wu et al. 2014 ). ParamChem (https://cgenff.paramchem.org, Vanommeslaeghe et al. 2010) was used to obtain the CHARMM general force field (CGenFF) compatible stream file of Arb/ Arp which contained the optimized parameter and topology data of the molecule (for the optimization guide see http:// mackerell.umaryland.edu/*kenno/cgenff/). The automatic PSF generation plugin for VMD (Humphrey et al. 1996) utilized the Arb/Arp stream file data to obtain the psf and pdb files of Arb/Arp required by VMD/NAMD to build the complete system. Since Arb/Arp have a highly hydrophobic character and a high phospholipid/water partition coefficient (Villalain 2010) , at the beginning of the simulation the Arb/Arp molecules were embedded at the center of the lipid bilayer in order to quickly reach convergence (Galiano and Villalain 2015; Kosinova et al. 2012 ).",

The center-of-mass z-distance of the Arb/Arp molecule relative to the center of the bilayer was used to study its spatial distribution in the membrane. The Arb/Arp membrane relative orientation was measured by the angle defined by the z-axis and the vector defined by carbons C4 and C4 0 of the molecule of Arb/Arp (see Fig. 1 for numbering). The analysis was performed over the whole MD simulation unless stated otherwise. VMD (Humphrey et al. 1996) and Pymol were used for visualization and analysis.

The time traces of the area per molecule for the system POPC/POPG/Chol/ Arb corresponding to the z? and z-leaflets are shown in Fig. S1A and S1C, respectively. As expected, no significant changes were found in the general bilayer properties in this diluted system, i.e., system having 128 lipid molecules and only 1 molecule of Arb. The data show that phospholipids and cholesterol were equilibrated early on the course of the simulation, either at the z? or at the z-bilayer leaflets, indicating that the system reached a steady state after 1500 ps of simulation. The time traces of the molecular area for the system POPC/POPG/Chol/Arp and corresponding to the z? and z-leaflets are shown in Fig. S1B and S1D, respectively.

The center-of-mass dispersion of Arb was also significantly lower than Arb, since along the whole simulation time it varied from about 8-17 \u00c5 . The histograms corresponding to the Arb and Arp center-of-mass for the last 2 ps of the simulation are shown in Fig. 2c , d, respectively. There was a small difference in the final location of the center-of-mass of both molecules, since that pertaining to Arb was located at about 10-11 \u00c5 from the center of the bilayer, whereas that corresponding to Arp was located at about 12.5-13.5 \u00c5 . The center-of-mass dispersion was larger for Arb, about 6 \u00c5 , than for Arp, about 3.5 \u00c5 . In a similarly way to the behavior of the area versus time trend commented above, membrane thickness, measured as the average distance between the center-ofmass of the phosphate atoms of opposite leaflets, was held relatively constant after 12 and 20 ns for the systems POPC/ POPG/Chol/Arb and POPC/POPG/Chol/Arp, respectively (Fig. 2e, f) . These data would indicate again a rapid equilibration of both systems.",

As seen in Fig. 4a , Arb is located at a lower depth than the phosphate groups of both phospholipids, POPC and POPG, reaching as low as the center of the bilayer, where the cholesterol tail is located. However, Arp, being located at a lower depth than the phosphate groups of both phospholipids, has a membrane depth similar to that of the OH group of cholesterol (Fig. 4b) . The mass density profile of the phospholipid phosphate atoms in both systems was rather symmetric. In the case of the POPC/POPG/Chol/Arb system, the half bandwidths were about 5.7 and 5.9 \u00c5 for the z? and zleaflets, respectively. For the POPC/POPG/Chol/Arp system, the half bandwidths were of about 5.8 and 5.2 \u00c5 for the z? and z-leaflets, respectively. However, there were significant differences in the mass density profile of the phosphate atoms in both systems for each type of phospholipid, i.e., POPC and POPG. For the POPC/POPG/ Chol/Arb system (Fig. 4c) , the maximum of the POPC phosphate atoms mass density was found at 21.47 and 20.98 \u00c5 for the z? and z-leaflets, respectively, whereas for the POPG phosphate atoms they were 20.93 and 20.48 \u00c5 , respectively. The difference between the POPC and POPG maxima were therefore 0.54 and 0.5 \u00c5 for the z? and z-leaflets, respectively. For the POPC/POPG/ Chol/Arp system (Fig. 4d) , the maximum of the POPC phosphate atoms mass density was found at 21.38 and 21.17 \u00c5 for the z? and z-leaflets, respectively, whereas for the POPG phosphate atoms they were 20.05 and 20.52 \u00c5 , respectively. The difference between the POPC and POPG maxima were therefore 1.33 and 0.65 \u00c5 for the z? and z-leaflets, respectively. This data would imply the Fig. 2 Time variation of the center-of-mass of Arb and Arp for the membrane systems containing a POPC/POPG/Chol/ Arb and b POPC/POPG/Chol/ Arp, respectively. The average center-of-mass of Arb/Arp (black), the z? leaflet phosphate atoms (blue), and the z?/zleaflets phosphate atoms (red) are visible. The last 2 ps histograms of Arb and Arp center-of-masses are shown in c and d, respectively. The total membrane thickness for the POPC/POPG/Chol/Arb and POPC/POPG/Chol/Arp are shown in e and f, respectively (Color figure online) existence of differences in the location of the phosphate atoms depending on phospholipid type. Furthermore, the location and/or orientation of Arp in the bilayer induced a larger distortion on the phosphate atoms of the phospholipids than Arb. This can be easily observed on the of the Arb/Arp mass density profile expansion shown on Fig. 4e . The Arb mass density profile is a broad one, with a half bandwidth of about 9.35 \u00c5 , whereas the mass density profile half bandwidth of Arp is about 6.4 \u00c5 . This data show us that the orientation of Arp in the membrane is nearly parallel to the membrane z-axis, whereas Arp tends to be perpendicular to it. This difference in molecule location and orientation in the membrane is the cause of the different effects commented above.",

With that aim, we have obtained the deuterium order parameter, -S CD , for the saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon acyl chains of both POPC and POPG phospholipids in the POPC/POPG/Chol/ Arb and POPC/POPG/Chol/Arp systems. When there is full order along the normal bilayer, -S CD has a value of 0.5, but when there is full order along the bilayer plane, -S CD has a value of -0.25 (Tieleman et al. 1997 ). An isotropic orientation is given by a -S CD value of 0. The average -S CD values of the sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains of POPC for the POPC/POPG/Chol/Arb system are relatively similar in both leaflets, z? and z-( Fig. S2A and S2B , respectively), in agreement with the profiles observed earlier for experimental and simulated data (Bockmann et al. 2003; Klauda et al. 2010; Tsai et al. 2015) . The same can be said for the average -S CD values of the sn-1 of POPG in the same system (Fig. S2E) . However, small but significant differences could be observed for the -S CD values of the sn-2 of POPG when comparing leaflets z? and z- (Fig. S2F) , indicating that Arb modifies the order parameter of the hydrocarbon chains in the leaflet it resides. Since there is only one molecule of Arb per system, we have also calculated the -S CD values of the hydrocarbon acyl chains of POPC and POPG molecules that are within 7 \u00c5 of the molecule of Arb. The presence of Arb gives place to minor differences in the -S CD values, particularly on carbons 5-10 of the sn-1 chain of POPC (Fig. S2A) , 10-14 of the sn-1 chain of POPG (Fig. S2E) , and 12-16 of the sn-2 chain of POPG (Fig. S2F) .",

The -S CD values of the sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains of POPC molecules that are within 7 \u00c5 of the molecule of Arb are similar to the global -S CD values ( Fig. S2C and  S2D ). There were no significant differences between the -S CD values of POPG in the POPC/POPG/Chol/Arp system of both leaflets z? and z-, either in the sn-1 chain or in the sn-2 one ( Fig. S2G and S2H ). However, differences in the -S CD values of POPG within 7 \u00c5 of the molecule of Arp could be observed, more apparent on the sn-1 chain than on the sn-2 one. As observed in Fig. S2G , carbons 3-13 of the sn-1 chain have greatly reduced -S CD values when compared to the global -S CD values, indicating the specific interaction of Arp with the sn-1 chain of POPG. Although some differences were observed for the sn-2 chain of POPG, these were not as significant as those observed for the sn-1 chain (compare Fig. 3g, h) .",

In this work, we have studied the location and orientation of arbidol in the membrane by molecular dynamics simulations. The final configurations for both POPC/POPG/Chol/Arb and POPC/POPG/Chol/ Arp membrane model systems are shown in Fig. 5a , b. At the start of the simulation, both Arb/Arp molecules were located in the middle of the palisade structure of the bilayer and at the same coordinates. At the end of the simulation, Arb locates in the middle of the palisade structure of the monolayer in a perpendicular orientation to the membrane surface. However, Arp locates near the surface in vicinity to the phospholipid interfacial region and nearly parallel to the membrane surface. Therefore, both Arb and Arp tend to locate preferentially in a definite part of the membrane, with a specific and completely different orientation. The different disposition of both molecules in the membrane could differently perturb the membrane structure depending on the relative proportion of the protonated and unprotonated forms in the membrane. Moreover, since Arp, positively charged, seems to interact stronger with POPG, negatively charged, than with POPC, it would be possible that the active molecule of arbidol in the membrane would be the protonated positively charged molecule. The broad antiviral activity of arbidol would rely on the effects it exerts on the membrane structure in general and in negatively charged phospholipids in particular.",
