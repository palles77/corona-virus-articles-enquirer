Using the vector autoregression (VAR) model, this study analyzes the impact of urbanization on pollution-related agricultural input intensity in Hubei, China. Results of an impulse response function analysis reveal that pesticide use intensity continues to rise following shocks from the urban population proportion and the secondary and tertiary industry proportion. Responses of chemical fertilizer intensity first decrease and then increase subjected to the shocks from the urban population proportion and secondary and tertiary industry proportion. The intensity of agricultural plastic film use first increases and then decreases when receives the shocks from the urban population proportion which is the opposite to the response to the shock from the secondary and tertiary industry proportion. In addition, the responses of pesticide use intensity, chemical fertilizer use intensity and agricultural plastic film use intensity trend decrease following their own shocks after positive initial responses. The variance decomposition results demonstrate that the shocks due to pesticide use intensity, chemical fertilizer use intensity and agricultural plastic film use intensity generally explain the largest proportion of their own variation over the 10-year horizon. However, an increase in the urban population proportion plays a critical role in determining the variations of pesticide use intensity in late periods, it account for 56.88% the variations in the tenth period. And the contribution of the urban population proportion to the variations in agricultural plastic film use intensity increases consistently, it account for 33.74% of the variations in the tenth period. Therefore, the hidden drivers of these phenomena need to be further understood regarding the relationships between urbanization and diffuse pollution from agricultural production.",

            "text": "Agricultural pollution is one of the urgent national priorities in China considering the wide-ranging occurrence and serious consequences (Saysel et al., 2002; Su et al., 2011) . Rapid urbanization promotes excessive farmland conversion and the rapid development of highly polluting industries, which pose a serious threat to the eco-environment in China (Su et al., 2014b) . Agricultural pollution consistently emerges in step with economic growth (Fischer et al., 2012) . It is argued that China's agricultural pollution is closely linked to the large inputs of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and plastic films (Ma et al., 2014; Smith and Siciliano, 2015; Yang et al., 2014) . It is estimated that China has become the largest user of agricultural chemicals in the world (Huang et al., 2002) . Although Chinese government has taken actions through technology advancement and policy intervention, it is still in the struggle to find the best and most effective solutions to control the pollution-related agricultural input (chemical fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural plastic film) (Valipour, 2015b; Valipour et al., http://dx.doi.org/10.1016 Valipour et al., http://dx.doi.org/10. /j.ecolind.2015 .002 1470-160X/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 2015). Besides, the booming urbanization should accelerate the agricultural land conversion in the rural areas, and the farmers may increase the pollution-related input intensity to maintain and enhance productivity. Consequently, in order to tackle with the agricultural pollution in the rapid urbanization owing to the great pollution-related agricultural input intensity, it requires elaborate efforts to quantify the relationship between urbanization and pollution-related agricultural input intensity.",

Many factors can lead to the variations in the pollution-related agricultural input intensity. Brasselle et al.

Phimister and Roberts (2006) found that off-farm work has significant impacts on input intensity; and the intensity of fertilizer use declines as the amount of off-farm labor increases. Udry (1996) reported the gender-related differences in sub-Saharan Africa, which found that the intensity of manure use and labor inputs in plots farmed by women is lower than in similar plots farmed by men. Jorgenson (2007) reported that pesticide input intensity in 40 less-developed countries rose in correspondence with the growth of direct foreign investment. Chibwana et al. (2014) found that the Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP) in Malawi, whose purpose is to stimulate the production of food crops, has increased fertilizer use intensity among smallholder farmers. However, the relationship between urbanization and pollution-related agricultural input intensity has not yet been clearly defined.",

Therefore, the general assumption for OLS is that the independent variable should not be correlated with the error term. Violating this assumption, when applying OLS on time series data, the endogeneity problem would causes bias in coefficients estimation. In this study, there may be a loop of causality between urbanization variables and the intensity variables of the pollution-related agricultural inputs which is one important cause of endogeneity. The VAR model proposed by Sims (1980) allows for the potential endogeneity in the multiple time series (Phillips, 1995) . It is widely used to analyze linear interdependencies among multiple time series. The VAR model is a theory-free method for assessing the relationships between variables. It provides a flexible and computationally tractable method to capture the effects of structural shocks between variables by treating all of the selected variables as endogenous (Kumar et al., 2012) . In this regard, the VAR model is appropriate for analyzing the temporal variations in pollution-related agricultural input intensity caused by urbanization. In this study, I specifically attempt to (1) develop the VAR model for analyzing the impact of urbanization on pollution-related agricultural input intensity; (2) discuss the dynamic relationships between urbanization and agricultural pollution-related input intensity in Hubei, China.",

Therefore unit-root test should be conducted to check the time series.

But these VAR models have not been perfectly proved the feasibility for impulse response function analysis in the current analysis procedure. They only play a role in selecting the lag lengths. The alternative statistical criteria for the selection of the lag length of the VAR model under consideration are the sequentially modified LR test statistic (LR), the final prediction error (FPE), the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Schwarz information criterion (SC), the Hannan-Quinn information criterion (HQ), etc. (Zhang and Cheng, 2009 ).

The number of observations affects the accuracy of alternative statistical criteria, but the differences in accuracy are small given the number of observations. Consequently, in order to improve the robustness, the lag length selected by the most criteria is the optimal number of lags in this study. It appears that the optimal number of lags in the VAR model for analyzing the relationships among UP, STP and PUI is 1. The optimal number for analyzing the relationships among UP, STP and CUI is 2, and the optimal number for analyzing the relationships among UP, STP and AUI is 1.

The VAR model was applied to analyze the impact of urbanization on pollution-related agricultural input intensity using variables that are connected by long-run equilibria. Generally, impulse response function analysis is used to track the dynamic effects on endogenous variables when the VAR model receives a one-time residual shock. The preliminary step in impulse response function analysis is the estimation of several three-variable VAR specifications for urbanization and pollution-related agricultural input intensity. The criteria presented in Table 5 were employed to establish the VAR model. I assume that the VAR model with three variables including UP, STP and PUI using 1 lag is VAR a , the VAR model with three variables including UP, STP and CUI using 2 lags is VAR b , and the VAR model with three variables including UP, STP and AUI using 1 lag is VAR c . To test the fit of the developed VAR specifications, stability tests are performed to examine whether further implementation of the VAR model will yield an invalid conclusion. The stability test can be actualized by calculating the inverse roots of the AR characteristic polynomial. On condition that all the inverse roots lie inside the circle, the estimated VAR model satisfies the condition for stability. Fig. 3 shows that all of the inverse roots of the VAR a , VAR b and VAR c models lie inside the circle. Therefore, the results of the impulse response analysis based on the VAR model established in this study are valid. Fig. 4 plots the response of pollution-related agricultural input intensity variables, which consist of PUI, CUI and AUI returning to a one-time positive shock from changes in urbanization. The data in Fig. 4 (a)-(c) were analyzed by the VAR a model, and Fig. 4(a) shows the response of pesticide use intensity to the proportion of the urban population. The positive response of pesticide use intensity continues to rise after the shock and reaches its highest level in the seventh period; it then remains relatively stable for 4 years. The increasing urban population proportion represents the shift in the population from rural to urban areas (You, 2015) . The population reduction in the rural areas implies labor transfer from agriculture to industry and service employment in urban areas. Due to the decreases in agricultural labor, the peasant households have to increase pesticide use per unit of agricultural land to prevent, destroy, or repel pests and to protect plants from damage caused by weeds and plant diseases in Hubei (Ntow et al., 2006) . Fig. 4(b) shows the response of pesticide use intensity to the secondary and tertiary industry proportion. The shock from the secondary and tertiary industry proportion causes an initial reduction in pesticide use intensity at a rate of 1.25%, but the response trend returns back to zero after 4 years. However, the increase in pesticide use intensity is relatively weak and never exceeds 0.40%. The development of secondary and tertiary industry provides opportunities to earn wealth and comfort and raises the standard of living (Zheng et al., 2007) . People, especially those in mediumhigh to high income groups, begin to pursue healthier lifestyles and pay more attention to the factors that may harm their health. For example, organic food that is produced with reduced pesticide use, which coincides with lower instances of pesticide residues, is becoming more and more popular. People are willing to pay more for organic than conventional food to avoid potential health risks. Peasant households catering to this current trend decrease pesticide use intensity on their agricultural lands. However, they may find that the reduction in pesticide use intensity may have serious negative impacts on agricultural production in Hubei and have no choice but to increase pesticide use to obtain higher incomes. Fig. 4(c) shows the response of pesticide use intensity to pesticide use intensity. After an initial shock, the response peaks at 2.77% in the first period, but the positive effect of pesticide use intensity continues to decay and becomes negative after 8 years. This reveals that pesticide use intensity has the momentum to grow continually in the early period, but there are limits to its growth as pesticide use intensity is particularly high in Hubei.",

            "text": "The data in Fig. 4 (d)-(f) were analyzed by the VAR b model. Fig. 4(d) shows the response of chemical fertilizer use intensity to a one-time positive shock from the urban population proportion. The response is 1.95% in the first period, and it reaches its lowest point after 1 year. However, chemical fertilizer use intensity then swings from a reduction to an increase over time and peaks in the fifth period. The subsequent response is positive until the tenth period. Currently, machines cannot be widely used to spread chemical fertilizer in Hubei, and the farmers in many areas are primarily the elderly, children and women, who spread chemical fertilizer by hand (Liu et al., 2012) . During urbanization, young labor forces leave from the rural areas into the urban cities. Therefore, the remaining old and female labor tends to apply more chemical fertilizer (Aregay and Minjuan, 2012) . However, most peasant households do not have enough labor to spread chemical fertilizer by hand, so use intensity is decreased after a short time. In contrast, off-farm employment, which reduces livelihood risks in peasant households, has a positive effect on the rise in fixed agricultural investment (Takahashi and Otsuka, 2009) . As a result, the peasant households in Hubei increase their chemical fertilizer use intensity for a long time into the future. Fig. 4(e) shows the response of chemical fertilizer use intensity to a one-time positive shock from the secondary and tertiary industry proportion, which causes an initial reduction in chemical fertilizer use intensity by approximately 11.29%. The response in chemical fertilizer use intensity reaches its nadir after 1 year, and then continues to rise and peaks at 18.63% in the sixth period. It subsequently decreases rapidly in the last 4 years. The development of secondary and tertiary industry increases the amount of land required for construction (Su et al., 2014a,c) , and the process of agricultural land conversion is driven by the local government to finance urban infrastructure and transportation (Tan et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2015) . The expansion of construction land increases the insecurity of the agricultural land because it is held publically under a household responsibility system. Insecure land tenure means that the peasant households have no incentive to invest in the agricultural land, such as through the use of organic manure and phosphate fertilizer (Li et al., 1998) . So the growth of secondary and tertiary industry reduces the use of chemical fertilizer per unit of agricultural land. However, long-term land use will improve land tenure security. Chemical fertilizer use intensity therefore presents a rising trend in the long term as the peasant households in Hubei increase their investment. Fig. 4(f) shows the response in chemical fertilizer use intensity to a one-time positive shock from chemical fertilizer use intensity. The shock causes an initial increase in chemical fertilizer use intensity at a rate of 24.92%, but the response declines until the fifth period before starting to tame off. Finally, chemical fertilizer use intensity increases by 15.33% after 5 years. This response demonstrates that the intensity of chemical fertilizer use has momentum to keep growing, which is accompanied by a decreasing trend in the early period when the use of chemical fertilizer begins to increase in Hubei. However, peasant households tend to control the rate of growth of chemical fertilizer use intensity due to existing high levels of fertilizer use and rising prices (Huang et al., 2013) .",

The urban population proportion has a positive impact on the spread of agricultural plastic film use, and the response peaks at 0.63% in the second period; thereafter, the response weakens. The growth of the urban population proportion changes the plantation pattern in China as people consume more vegetables, melons and fruits (Hao et al., 2011) . Peasant households can enhance the output of these crash crops with extensive coverage by agricultural plastic film. The application of agricultural plastic film increases as a consequence. Fig. 4(h) shows the response of agricultural plastic film use intensity to a one-time positive shock from the secondary and tertiary industry proportion. The secondary and tertiary industry proportion has a negative impact on the spread of agricultural plastic film use. There is an initial reduction of approximately 0.21% in chemical fertilizer use intensity, but it rises to approximately zero in subsequent periods. The main reason for this is that the development of secondary and tertiary industry in China raises the prices of agricultural chemical inputs, such as agricultural plastic film (Huang et al., 2013) . The rising production costs impose an additional strain on peasant households, so they choose to reduce their use of agricultural plastic film. Fig. 4 (i) shows the response of agricultural plastic film use intensity to a one-time positive shock from agricultural plastic film use intensity. The shock has a positive impact on agricultural plastic film use intensity, which peaks at 1.69% in the first period. However, it decreases rapidly after 1 year to become stable at a rate of approximately 0.12% thereafter. This result reveals that the rapid growth in agricultural plastic film use does not persist. While large quantities of agricultural plastic film have been used on agricultural land to increase crop yields and improve water retention efficiency in Hubei, large amounts of agricultural plastic film residue have been generated and have not degraded. Plastic film residues seriously reduce crop yields because they damage the physical structure of the soil and lead to poor water flow (Wang et al., 2015) . Accordingly, the use of agricultural plastic film cannot continue to increase in Hubei.",

However, the shocks from the secondary and tertiary industry proportion do not explain more than 4% of the variations in the intensity of agricultural plastic film use over the 10-year period.",

The initial response of chemical fertilizer use intensity following shocks from the urban population proportion and the secondary and tertiary industry proportion are positive and negative, respectively; these responses first decrease and then increase. The response of agricultural plastic film use intensity first increases and then decreases after shocks from the urban population proportion, but the opposite response to the shock from the secondary and tertiary industry proportion is observed. In addition, the responses of pesticide use intensity, chemical fertilizer use intensity and agricultural plastic film use intensity show a downward trend following their own shocks after initial positive responses. Based on variance decomposition using the VAR model, most of the forecast error variance in pesticide use intensity is explained by its own shock during the initial period, but an increase in the proportion of the urban population plays an important role in explaining the variation in pesticide use intensity during the last period. The shock from chemical fertilizer use intensity explained the largest proportion of its variations over the 10-year period, and the shock from agricultural plastic film use intensity also explains 98.39% of its variations in the first period. Afterward, the contribution of the urban population proportion gains strength, but the contribution of the secondary and tertiary industry proportion remains negligible.",

The hidden reasons behind the phenomena analyzed in this study should be further addressed to better coordinate the relationships between urbanization and increasing pollution from agricultural production. Moreover, increasing agricultural outputs should be realized with little or even no growth in the pollution-related agricultural input intensity.",
