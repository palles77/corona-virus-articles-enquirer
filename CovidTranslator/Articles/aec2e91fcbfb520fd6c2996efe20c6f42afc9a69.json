Objectives: The pooled efficacy data of two similar randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials were analyzed. Safety was evaluated on the basis of the individual trials. Methods: The efficacy analysis was based on 589 patients. Treatment was performed orally with either 3 \u00c2 160 mg BNO 1016 (n = 294) or 3 \u00c2 placebo (n = 295) for 15 days. In both trials patients underwent five visits to the investigational sites. Symptoms were evaluated according to the EPOS 2012 guideline. Ultrasonography was used to confirm the diagnosis at onset of treatment and the remission of symptoms at the last visit. Efficacy was evaluated by the investigator as the mean major symptom score (MSS) at the end of treatment (visit 5, day 14). Patients reported symptoms and social/ emotional consequences of rhinosinusitis using a quality of life questionnaire (SNOT-20 GAV). Results: MSS improved during the treatment period by a mean of 10.02 \u00b1 1.61 score points to 2.47 \u00b1 2.55 for BNO 1016 and of 9.87 \u00b1 1.52 to 3.63 \u00b1 3.63 for placebo. Differences between treatment groups at end of therapy (1.16 \u00b1 3.14 score points; p < 0.0001) and patient-assessed quality of life (p = 0.0015) were statistically significant in favor of BNO 1016.",

A rhinosinusitis usually involves one or several paranasal sinuses. It might be confirmed by ultrasonography or as an opacification in X-ray investigation. According to the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS 2012) acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is definedbesides as an inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinusesby two or more of the following characteristic symptoms: nasal congestion or secretion combined with facial pain or pressure or loss/reduction of smell [1] .",

The demarcation of acute and chronic rhinosinusitis is mainly defined by length of the disease and not by specific symptoms. According to the definitions in EPOS 2012 an ARS is completely healed without remaining symptoms after 12 weeks, while in a chronic rhinosinusitis one or several symptoms still remain after that period. An acute viral rhinosinusitis lasts less than 10 days while an acute post-viral rhinosinusitis persists after 10 days. In the latter case there is often a biphasic symptom pattern with persisting or impairing symptoms by the end of the 10-day period. ARS is predominantly caused by a number of viruses (rhinovirus, parainfluenza-1 and -2, coronavirus, and influenza viruses), which all induce an increase of proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophils [2] . A similar type of reaction occurs also in a bacterial infection. Thus, an ARS can easily be misdiagnosed as a bacterial infection and is therefore treated with antibiotics, which at this stage of the disease does not improve healing.",

Thus, the mode of action rationalizes its therapeutic use in the treatment of sinusitis and other viral/microbial nasal infections that are associated with inflammation.
