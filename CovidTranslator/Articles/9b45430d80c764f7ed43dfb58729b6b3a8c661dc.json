            "text": "To increase immune responses of plant-based vaccines in intestine mucosal immune systems, a synthetic neutralizing epitope (sCOE) gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was fused with M cell-targeting ligand (Co1) and introduced into a plant expression vector under the control of rice amylase 3D promoter. The sCOE-Co1 fusion gene was introduced into rice calli via the particle bombardment-mediated transformation method. The stable integration and transcriptional expression of the sCOE-Co1 fusion gene was confirmed by genomic DNA PCR amplification and Northern blot analysis, respectively. The expression of the COE-Co1 fusion protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. The highest expression level of the COE-Co1 fusion protein reached 0.083 % of the total soluble protein according to quantitative densitometry of Western blot analysis. Mice immunized with transgenic rice calli protein extracts induced significant serum IgG and fecal IgA antibody levels against purified bacterial COE. The systemic and mucosal immune responses were confirmed by measuring COE-specific IgG and IgA antibody-secreting cells in the lymphocytes extracted from the spleen and COE-specific IgA antibody-secreting cells in the Peyer's patches from immunized mice. These results indicated that oral immunization of plant-produced COE-Co1 fusion protein could elicit efficient systemic and mucosal immune responses against the COE antigen. Key message Neutralizing epitope from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-M cell targeting ligand fusion protein was produced in transgenic rice calli and elicited systemic and mucosal immune responses by oral administration in mice.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is classified as a member of Group I of the genus Coronaviruses, the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales (Cavanagh and Britton 2008) . PEDV is an etiologic agent of diarrhea in pigs, especially newborn pigs (Cavanagh 2005; Cavanagh et al. 1993) . PEDV disrupts villus enterocytes and causes villious atrophy within the jejunum and ileum, leading to a mortality rate of up to 95 % in infected piglets (Ducatelle et al. 1981) . The genome consists of a single molecule of linear positive-sense, single-stranded RNA. The complete sequence of the entire genome of strain CV777 was found to be 28,033 nucleotides in length excluding the poly A-tail (Kocherhans et al. 2001) . The viral encoded-proteins from the PEDV genome have four structural proteins: a large spike glycoprotein or peplomer (S, 180-220 kDa), an integral membrane glycoprotein (M, 27-32 kDa), a small envelope protein with a small amount of virions, and a phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N, 55-58 kDa) (Cavanagh and Britton 2008; Egberink et al. 1988) . Spike proteins attach viral particles to receptors on the host cells and subsequently penetrate into the cells by membrane fusion. The S glycoprotein also stimulates induction of neutralizing antibodies in the host (Duarte and Laude 1994; Yeo et al. 2003) . The S glycoprotein is, therefore, essential for the development of a vaccine against PEDV. The predicted polypeptide was 1,383 amino acids long containing 29 potential N-linked glycosylation sites and showed structural features similar to those of the coronavirus spike protein (Duarte and Laude 1994) . The S glycoprotein of PEDV lacks a proteolytic site to yield cleaved amino and carboxy subunits, S1 and S2, but can be divided into the S1 domain (1-789 amino acids) and the S2 domain (790-1,383 amino acids) based on the presence of the conserved nonamer and GxCx motifs at the proteolytic cleavage site of S protein in other members of coronavirus, Group II (Follis et al. 2006) . Based on the sequence information for the neutralizing epitope of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus, Chang et al. identified the neutralizing epitope region of PEDV (CO-26 K equivalent, COE gene) as containing 139 amino acids spanning the region of 499-638 amino acids within the S1 domain (Chang et al. 2002) . In previous studies, the synthetic COE (sCOE) gene of PEDV, which was modified based on the plant-optimized codon usage, was expressed in tobacco plants (Bae et al. 2003; Kang et al. 2004 Kang et al. , 2005 . The sCOE gene fused with an Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin B subunit (LTB) gene was expressed in transgenic tobacco plants (Kang et al. 2006) , rice seeds (Oszvald et al. 2007 ) and lettuce plants (Huy et al. 2009 ). Alternatively, the sCOE gene fused with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) was expressed in lettuce plants (Huy et al. 2011) . The COE gene is, therefore, considered to be an important target in the development of subunit vaccine against PEDV infection.",

However, the low expression level of antigens in transgenic plants induces low immune responses and immune tolerances in animal models. This limitation is an important bottleneck that stands in the way of developing plant-based edible vaccines. One solution is to increase antigen delivery into mucosal immune systems via ligands, such as cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heatlabile enterotoxin B subunit (LTB) and a variety of B subunits of toxins. Recently, Kim et al. (2010a) showed that the M celltarget peptide ligand, Co1, in orally treated mice enhanced the uptake of fused antigen into the effective sites of mucosal immune systems and immune responses against fused antigen as compared to antigens alone.",

            "text": "PEDV causes acute enteritis with a death rate greater than 95 % in infected piglets, leading to significant economic losses in swine husbandry (Kang et al. 2005) . PED is one of the most devastating diseases in suckling piglets, and it frequently occurs in Korea (Lee and Yeo 2003) . Therefore, it is important to develop an effective vaccine to protect pigs against PEDV infection. The COE epitope of PEDV spike glycoprotein showed neutralizing activities against PEDV (Chang et al. 2002) ; the COE epitope alone or fusion proteins with mucosal carriers have been expressed in various kinds of plants, including tobacco (Kang et al. 2005 (Kang et al. , 2006 , lettuce (Huy et al. 2009 (Huy et al. , 2011 and rice endosperm (Oszvald et al. 2007) . Rice is one of the most important food crops and the staple food for more than half the world's population, particularly in Asian countries (Khush 2005) . Recently, a transgenic rice grain has been developed for use as a mucosal vaccine, which possesses several advantages (Takagi et al. 2005; Takaiwa 2007; Tokuhara et al. 2010 ). In the present experiment, prior to development of transgenic rice, the synthetic COE-Co1 fusion protein was produced in transgenic rice calli, and its immunogenicity was tested in mice. Transgenic plants have been widely used as production system to express heterologous proteins for vaccine antigens. These plants should decrease the required amount of plant-based edible vaccine because it is often painful for animals to consume a large amount of plant material during a short period of time. A lower expression level of antigen protein in transgenic plants means that the feed amount has to be increased, which can be painful and stressful to 1933-1942 1939 animals. In addition, oral immunization of a vaccine with low expression level of antigens in transgenic plants induces low immune responses and immune tolerances. The improvement of the expression level of antigen genes in transgenic plants and the delivery of plant-produced antigens into the mucosal immune system could result in enhancement of immune responses. The COE gene, which has been modified based on the plant-optimized codon usage, produces fivefold higher levels of antigens than that expressed with the native gene (Kang et al. 2005) . The expression level of recombinant protein under the control of RAmy3D expression system showed a 1,000-fold enhanced expression level in a rice suspension culture system (Shin et al. 2003 ). In the present study, codon optimization of the target gene and RAmy3D promoter expression system were applied, and the expression level of the COE-Co1 fusion protein was approximately to 0.083 % of TSP in transgenic rice calli at day 3 after induction. Plant-based oral vaccines elicited immune tolerance and low immune responses against the antigen due to the low expression level of antigen proteins in transgenic plants. The use of ligands to deliver vaccine antigens into mucosal immune systems should be considered to overcome the low immune response in plant-based edible vaccines. The cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli enterotoxin B subunit (LTB) have been used to deliver fused antigens into mucosal immune systems and have efficiently induced immune responses. However, these ligands have a size limitation of fused antigen proteins for assembling biologically active ligand-fusion proteins and cannot be used repeatedly in mice previously immunized with CTB and LTB fusion proteins. The M cell-target peptide ligand Co1 (with 12 amino acids) has been shown to be an effective delivery method of Co1fused antigen to mucosal immune inductive sites through M cell targeting without a size limitation of fused proteins and induces the enhanced immune responses against the fused antigen as compared to those of the antigen without a ligand (Kim et al. 2010a ).",
