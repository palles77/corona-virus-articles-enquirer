These live vaccine strains have a high safety record and can stimulate both cellular and humoral immune responses. As both of these factors are critical characteristics of a good vaccine, we aimed to modify the oral PV vaccines to create a powerful vaccine vector for extraneous antigen expression. In this study, we amplified three separate fragments from the Sabin 1 virus genome by RT-PCR and cloned them into the pGEM-TEasy vector. A cassette containing engineered protease cleavage sites and a polylinker was introduced into one of these fragments (f1) in front of the translation start site. This construction facilitated the insertion of foreign genes into the vector and the subsequent release of their co-translated antigens after digestion by endogenous protease. We also placed a ribozyme (Rz) sequence between the T7 promoter and viral genomic DNA so that in vitro transcription and Rz cleavage recreated the authentic 5 0 end of the PV genome RNA. Poly(A) 40 tails were added to the 3 0 end of the genome to stabilize the transcribed RNA. The three PV genome fragments and their derivatives were cloned into various types of vectors that were transfected into Vero cells. Virus rescue experiments demonstrated that both the Rz and poly(A) 40 elements were required for high transfection efficiency of the vector-derived RNAs.",

Small epitopes can be conjugated to one of the neutralizing domains of the capsid proteins (Burke et al. 1989; Dedieu et al. 1992) , but the usefulness of this hybrid virion strategy is greatly decreased by restrictions on the size of the attached epitope (normally < 25 amino acids). Another strategy, in which one of the structural protein genes is replaced with the foreign gene (Bledsoe et al. 2000; Novak et al. 1999) , results in recombinant viruses that are defective in replication and require a helper virus to provide the necessary structural protein. In the most frequently adopted strategy, polyprotein fusion, the foreign antigen is fused at either the N-terminus of the polyprotein or at the junction between the capsid proteins and the nonstructural proteins in the PV polyprotein, along with an artificial protease site. Thus, after co-translation with the viral polyprotein, the foreign antigen is easily removed by one of the endogenous proteases and is released into the cytoplasm (Andino et al. 1994; Mattion et al. 1995) .",

Although the value of the oral live PV vaccines (Sabin vaccines types 1, 2, and 3) is widely recognized, these vaccines do have an inherent risk; even though the likelihood is very low, the attenuated live virus can revert to the neurovirulent phenotype. Indeed, a very small number of cases of vaccineassociated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) have occurred in recipients of oral PV vaccine (Melnick 1984) . Experimental evidence strongly suggests that most of these cases are caused by Sabin vaccines types 2 and 3 (Kew et al 1981; Minor 1982) . In an enquiry made by the World Health Organization, VAPP cases due to type 3 virus were found to be the most common in both vaccine recipients and their contacts. Type 2-induced VAPP occurred more often in contacts than in vaccinees, and Sabin 1 was rarely implicated (Esteves 1988) . Given that a human vaccine must be safe for use in human immunization, we selected the Sabin 1 virus as posing the least risk to its recipients. We cloned the whole genome of Sabin 1 PV by RT-PCR. Sequence comparisons of the resulting clone and the Sabin 1 genome sequence (GenBank accession no. AY184219) revealed only three, singlebase mutations. Two mutations were silent, whereas the third one resulted in a Lys 250 (our sequence)?Arg change in polymerase 3D. A mutation at this third site was also found in another Sabin 1 genome sequence (Genbank accession no. V01150), with a Lys 250 (our sequence)?Glu change in polymerase 3D. These observations suggest that this site is a mutation ''hot spot'' in Sabin 1 strains, and the resulting mutations have no significant effect on the function of polymerase 3D.",

            "text": "Two foreign inserts, CTBM2e (450 bp) and SARS-RBD (560 bp), were cloned into the pPV1RzA vector in frame, and the recombinant viruses were rescued using the same procedure as that used for the vectors. The successful rescue of both recombinant viruses in this study indicated that the established vectors still worked well when carrying the foreign genes. Both recombinant viruses expressed significant amounts of foreign antigen in the Vero cell cytoplasm, as confirmed by immunofluorescence detection. This observation is consistent with the PV life cycle, as PV completes its replication cycles in the cytoplasm. The gene fragment was expressed with the rest of the PV genome as part of the polyprotein and was cleaved away from the polyprotein by PV-encoded proteases, which cleaved at engineered proteolysis sites flanking the gene insert. The foreign antigens, as well as the viral proteins, released into the cytoplasm could be processed further and presented by the infected cells to stimulate an immune response against the recombinant virus, which is the basis of the polyprotein strategy for modifying PV to be a vaccine vector (Mattion et al. 1994) . However, the immune responses against the foreign proteins need further investigation in transgenic mice carrying the human PV receptor (Tang et al. 1997) or in cynomolgus macaques (Crotty et al. 1999) .",

Previous reports have suggested that this genetic instability is associated with a limitation on insert size and/or genetic recombination within (Tang et al. 1997) or between sequences during minus-strand synthesis (Muller and Wimmer 1998). Nevertheless, a clear molecular mechanism for the control of insert stability has not been well established.",

Even plaque-purified rPV-SARS-RBD with the intact insert remained unstable over three further passages, suggesting that this foreign gene has inherently destabilizing attributes. Lee et al. (2002 ) reported that the genetic stability of recombinant PV is strongly associated with the G/C content and G/C distribution pattern in foreign inserts of less than 450 bp, and that the genetic instability of foreign inserts can be promoted by increasing the G/C content and/or replacing the local A/T-rich region with a G/C-rich codon. In our study, however, rPV-CTBM2e remained stable, although the G/C content of CTBM2e is low (36.9%). Both the large size (600 bp) and low G/C content (38%) of the SARS-RBD may contribute to the instability of the rPV-SARS-RBD virus. Further work is needed to increase the stability of this recombinant virus.",
