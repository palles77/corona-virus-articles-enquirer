The number of MERS-CoV infection cases in the world has sharply increased since mid-March 2014 and the infections have spread from the Middle East to Europe, North Africa, Asia, and America. The World Health Organization (WHO) has encouraged all countries to monitor MRES-CoV and to carefully review any unusual patterns. However, for mild or unusual symptomatic infection, it is not always possible to identify the infection with MERS-CoV using PCR assay. Hence, it is important to perform seroepidemiological studies in natural populations to analyze HCoVs' epidemiologic spectrum.",

A recent study showed that BtCoV HKU5 and BtCoV HKU4 N proteins within the 2c subgroups share cross-reactive epitopes with MERS-CoV. In addition, BtCoV HKU3 and BtCoV 279 N proteins within the 2b subgroups share cross-reactive epitopes with SARS-CoV. 5 To evaluate the cross-reactivities among HCoVs, we developed a competitive ELISA (cELISA) as previously described for detecting anti-N IgG antibodies of six HCoVs. 6 To this end, we first identify HCoV-positive (including HCoV-229E, -OC43 -NL63, -HKU1, and SARS-CoV) and -negative human serum samples by Western blot analysis. Using these positive controls, we found that 1.0 mg/ml of competing N protein was sufficient for the competition assays in cELISA (Fig. 1AeE ).",

However, no cross-reactivity was observed between the N proteins across groups or subgroups. Therefore, cELISA assays were performed with N proteins between HCoV-NL63 and -229E, and HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 to minimize the cross-reactivity for seroprevalence determination. Since we did not have access to the positive human serum against MERS-CoV, the cross-reactivity of MERS-CoV antibodies with other HCoV N proteins could not be determined.

A tested sample was considered positive if its A450 was above the cut-off value. Then we tested anti-N IgG in sera from 695 healthy adults !15 yr by cELISA (Fig. 1F) .
