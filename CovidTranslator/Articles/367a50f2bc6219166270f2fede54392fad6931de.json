Then, anesthesiologists wore a disposable surgical gown and sterile gloves to complete the internal jugular vein cannulation, and connect to the pressure measuring device (Figure 1 ).

In particular, aortic dissection repair is a long and complicated operation 14 Considering the complexity and high risk of aortic dissection repair, direct hemodynamic monitoring with arterial and central lines is necessary. However, wearing multiple heavy protective equipment make these procedures difficult to perform. Real time ultrasound guidance should be used to improve the efficiency and safety. The ultrasound probe should be covered with a disposable cover to prevent probe contamination, which may lead to cross infection.",

Applying anti-fog agents on the goggles in advance can effectively reduce the fogging and water accumulation from breath and sweat evaporation. Long cases increases the risk of perioperative aerosol infections; therefore, we recommend to use medical adhesive tapes to strengthen the connection between the goggles and the mask, between the goggles and the protective clothing cap, and between the mouth and nose of the protective clothing to effectively prevent insufficient seal. Additionally, protective equipment should be replaced frequently in to maintain the best protective function.",

Considering SARS-CoV-2's strong transmissibility of and a substantial number of patients who are either asymptomatic or only with mild symptoms 2,3,12 , this brings great challenges to anesthesiologists for anesthetic management, infection prevention and control.

In our study, we reported four successful cases of aortic dissection repair in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and provided anesthetic management and precaution measures in these patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).SARS-CoV-2 proved to be transmitted through aerosol or fluid from human secretions or discharges, as well as cough, sneeze and surface contact6,11,15 . These modalities of transmission pose high exposure risk for healthcare providers in the operating room, especially anesthesiologists. In addition, COVID-19 patients may present with mild symptoms or nonspecific signs in the early stage of disease and are still infectious12,16 . Therefore, all perioperative healthcare providers need to adopt the third level of medical protection measures, including medical degree eye-protective goggles, medical degree mask, face shield, gloves, disposable protective clothing, and disposable shoe covers outside13 . Training of personnel for correct use of these precautions is important, and incorrect use may cause potential nosocomial infections and exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2.",
