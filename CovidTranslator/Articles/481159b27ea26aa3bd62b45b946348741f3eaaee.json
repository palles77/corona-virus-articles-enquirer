            "text": ". The most recent epidemic of SARS occurred in Beijing and Anhui in China in April 2004 and originated from laboratory contamination (WHO update 7; see Further information). Since then, no new case of SARS has been reported, possibly because of continued global vigilance and surveillance and laboratory bio-safety practices, as well as the euthanizing or quarantining of animals that may have been exposed to SARS-CoV 13, 14 . Although the outbreaks of SARS seem to be over, SARS is still a safety concern because of the possible reintroduction of a SL-CoV into humans and the risk of an escape of SARS-CoV from laboratories 15, 16 .",

Specific antibodies against SARS-CoV (immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM) were detectable approximately 2 weeks postinfection, reaching a peak 60 days post-infection and remaining at high levels until 180 days post-infection (ref. 17) . High titres of neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses were detected in patients who had recovered from SARS 18, 19 , and the levels of the responses correlated well with the disease outcome 20 . This suggests that both humoral and cellular immune responses are crucial for the clearance of infection by SARS-CoV.",

The SARS-CoV S protein encodes a surface glycoprotein precursor that is predicted to be 1,255 amino acids in length, and the amino terminus and most of the protein is predicted to be on the outside of the cell surface or the virus particles 3 . The predicted S protein consists of a signal peptide (amino acids 1-12) located at the N terminus, an extracellular domain (amino acids 195 ), a transmembrane domain (amino acids 1, 215) and an intracellular domain (amino acids 1,216-1,255) [29] [30] [31] [32] ( fig. 2a ). Similarly to other coronaviruses, the S protein of SARS-CoV can be cleaved into the S1 and S2 subunits by proteases, such as trypsin 33 , factor Xa 34 and cathepsin L 35 . The trypsin cleavage site occurs at R667-S668 (ref. 36) , whereas cathepsin L cleavage is mapped to T678-M679 in the S protein 35 . Cathepsin L cleaves the S protein of SARS-CoV upstream of, rather than adjacent to, the fusion peptide, and the cleavage is required for activation of the membrane fusion domain of the S protein following entry into target cells 35 .",

A fragment that is located in the S1 subunit and spans amino acids 318-510 is the minimal receptor-binding domain (RBD) 30, 38, 39 . Crystallographic studies have shown the structure of RBD complexed with its receptor ACE2 (refS 29,40) . During the interaction of RBD with the receptor, RBD presents a concave surface for the N terminus of the receptor peptidase, on which amino acids 445-460 anchor the entire receptor-binding loop of the RBD core ( fig. 2b ). This loop (amino acids 424-494 of the RBD), which makes complete contact with the receptor ACE2, was referred to as receptor-binding motif (RBM) (fig. 2a) . The RBM region is tyrosine rich. Among the 14 residues of RBM that are in direct contact with ACE2, six are tyrosine, representing both the hydroxyl group and hydrophobic ring. The RBD region also contains multiple cysteine residues that are linked by disulphide bonds 29 (fig. 2c ). Two residues in particular, those at positions 479 and 487, determine SARS disease progression and SARS-CoV tropism (host range) 41, 42 . Any residue changes in these two positions might therefore enhance animal-to-human or human-to-human transmission 29 .",

For example, a chimeric recombinant SARS-CoV that bears the S protein of civet SARS-CoV (icSZ16-S) can adapt to human airway epithelial cells and displays enhanced affinity for human ACE2 (ref. 43) . Changes of only a few residues in the RBD of the civet SARS-CoV S protein, which is responsible for binding with the peptidase domain of ACE2, result in enhanced human ACE2-binding affinity of SARS-CoVs from animals, including civets, mice and rats, facilitating efficient cross-species infections 29 . However, the SL-CoV from bats does not infect ACE2-expressing cells 7, 8 , suggesting that, unlike SARS-CoVs from human and civets, the SL-CoV from bats does not use ACE2 as a cellular receptor.

After the virus enters into the body, it binds to primary target cells that express abundant virus receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), including pneumocytes and enterocytes in the respiratory system. The virus enters and replicates in these cells. The matured virions are then released to infect new target cells 121 (fig. 1 ). SARS-CoV can also infect mucosal cells of intestines, tubular epithelial cells of kidneys, epithelial cells of renal tubules, cerebral neurons and immune cells 122, 123 . Infectious viral particles in patients with SARS can be excreted through respiratory secretions, stool, urine and sweat. SARS-CoV infection damages lung tissues owing to elevated levels of production and activation of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines 124 , resulting in atypical pneumonia with rapid respiratory deterioration and failure. SARS-CoV can also bind to host cells through alternative receptors, such as DC-SIGN (dendritic cellspecific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin) and/or L-SIGN (liver/lymph node-SIGN) 50, 51 . Seven asparagine-linked glycosylation sites in the S protein, including residues at positions 109, 118, 119, 158, 227, 589 and 699, are crucial for DC-SIGNor L-SIGN-mediated virus entry. These residues differ from those of the ACE2-binding domain located at amino acids 318-510 (ref. 52 ). This would suggest that S protein can also use DC-SIGN or L-SIGN as a receptor, independently of ACE2. However, the actual function of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN needs to be further verified.",

S2 contains heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and HR2 domains, which play an important part in SARS-CoV fusion with target cells. Binding of the RBD of S1 to the receptor ACE2 triggers a conformational change of the S2 from a pre-fusion form to a post-fusion form, resulting in insertion of the putative fusion peptide (amino acids 770-788) 31 into the target cell membrane and association of HR1 113, 121, [125] [126] [127] . S protein first binds to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 129 , and the ACE2-virus complex is then translocated to endosomes, where S protein is cleaved by the endosomal acid proteases (cathepsin L) 105 to activate its fusion activity. The viral genome is released and translated into viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and 1ab, which are then cleaved into small products by viral proteinases. Subgenomic negative-strand templates are synthesized from discontinuous transcription on the plus-strand genome and serve as templates for mRNA synthesis. The full-length negative-strand template is made as a template for genomic RNA. Viral nucleocapsids are assembled from genomic RNA and N protein in the cytoplasm, followed by budding into the lumen of the ERGIC (endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment) 128 . Virions are then released from the cell through exocytosis. ",

This brings the viral envelope and target cell membrane into close proximity for fusion. The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV fusion core is described in detail in ref. 55 ( fig. 3 ). Similarly to the S protein of MHV, but not gp41 of HIV-1, SARS-CoV S protein has a longer HR1 region than HR2 region. The six-helix bundle fusion core has a rod-shaped structure with a length of ~70 \u00c5 and a diameter of ~28 \u00c5. Three HR1 helices form a parallel trimeric coiled-coil that is surrounded by three HR2 helices in an oblique, antiparallel manner 55 ( fig. 3) . A synthetic peptide derived from the HR2 region could interact with an HR1 peptide to form a stable six-helix bundle and inhibit SARS-CoV infection in a dose-dependent manner 53 . Consequently, both the HR1 and HR2 regions in the S2 domains are expected to participate in the viral fusion and entry processes and will serve as attractive targets for the development of anti-SARS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines.",

S protein has therefore been selected as an important target for vaccine and antiviral development. A comparison of these approaches is provided in TABLe 1.

Other groups have also shown that vaccination of mice or monkeys with highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), which encodes the full-length S protein of the SARS-CoV urbani strain or HKu39849 strain, elicited S-specific neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity, as evidenced by decreased virus titres in the respiratory tracts of animals after homologous SARS-CoV challenge 60, 61 .

In addition, vaccination of mice or hamsters with a full-length S protein trimer protected these animals from infection by homologous SARS-CoV (HKu39849 strain) 62 . Furthermore, a recombinant baculovirus-expressed full-length S protein of the urbani strain and its trimer could induce sufficient neutralizing antibodies against human and palm civet SArS pseudoviruses that bore S proteins of homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV variants (for example, Tor2, GD03T13 and SZ3 strains) in vaccinated mice 63 .

The RBD strongly reacts with the antisera from patients with SARS in the convalescent phase, and depletion of the RBD-specific antibodies from patients with SARS results in significant elimination of the neu ralizing activity 69 . Chen et al. 61 have also shown that most neutralizing antibodies of antisera of mice, rabbits and monkeys induced by a live-attenuated MVA virus that expressed the full-length S protein could be absorbed and removed by rRBD. using a fusion protein that contained the RBD linked to human IgG1 Fc fragment (designated RBD-Fc) as an immunogen, we have successfully induced highly potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV BJ01 strain in immunized rabbits with neutralizing titres greater than 1:10,000 (ref. It should be noted that the efficacy of these vaccine candidates is mainly tested in young-mouse and primate animal models. These models are usually less robust, providing virus replication but lacking clinical symptoms and diseases. It is necessary, therefore, to develop more-robust animal models of human diseases for evaluation of vaccine efficacy. Baric and colleagues 78,79 have recently reported several lethal SARS-CoV challenge models in BALB/c mice that recapitulated the agerelated SARS disease by using recombinant SARS-CoV that bore the S protein of early human and zoonotic strains (GZ02 and HC/SZ/61/03, respectively). They also developed another pathogenic model for young mice after 15 passages of the urbani isolate in BALB/c mice, which resulted in a lethal virus, MA15, that replicates to high titres in the lungs of mice, causing clinical disease of SARS 78,79 . Other reports 80,81 list examples for the use of senescent mouse models for vaccine evaluation. One candidate vaccine, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles, that expressed the urbani SARS-CoV S protein partially protected the aged mice from challenge with a recombinant heterologous SARS-CoV that bore epidemic and zoonotic S proteins (icGDO3-S), providing a model to mimic the age-related susceptibility observed in the elder population 80 .

One of the HR2 peptides, T20 (enfuvirtide), was approved by the uS Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with HIV or AIDS, especially those who have failed to respond to the current antiretroviral drugs. These HR2 peptides could interact with the viral gp41 HR1 region at fusion-intermediate conformation and block six-helix bundle formation, resulting in the inhibition of HIV fusion at the nanomolar level 87,88 . Because the SARS-CoV S protein S2 domain also contains HR1 and HR2 sequences, we anticipated that peptides derived from the HR2 region of the SARS-CoV S protein S2 domain would also have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV. We designed and synthesized several peptides that overlapped the HR2 sequence and found that one of these, designated CP-1, could interact with an HR1 peptide to form a stable six-helix bundle and inhibited infection by SARS-CoV WHu strain in Vero E6 cells with an IC 50 of approximately 20 \u03bcM 53 . Later, several other research groups also identified anti-SARS-CoV peptides from the S2 domain HR2 region that had viral fusion inhibitory activity at the micromolar level 84,89,90 . An NMR study has shown that in the pre-fusion intermediate state, the HR2 region forms a symmetric coiled-coil trimer, which has not been observed for other class I viral fusion proteins. The poor antiviral activity of anti-SARS-CoV peptides, compared with the anti-HIV peptides, could be attributed to the tendency of the SARS-CoV S protein HR2 region to form the trimeric coiled-coil. Replacement of the key residues in the HR2 peptide to reduce its ability to form the trimer, but increase its affinity of binding with the HR1 region, to form the six-helix bundle could lead to improvement of its antiviral efficacy. The peptidic antiviral drugs for SARS and other emerging infectious diseases with short incubation periods could have more advantages than the anti-HIV drug enfuvirtide, as enfuvirtide must be injected twice per day for the patient's lifetime. This results in an intolerable injection-site reaction and a high cost to patients, whereas a few injections of the peptidic drugs against SARS-CoV in the early stage of the acute phase could be enough to save patients' lives.",

Yi et al. 108 identified two small molecules, tetra-o-galloyl-beta-d-glucose (TGG) and luteolin, which have inhibitory activity, that blocked SARS-CoV or SARS pseudovirus entry into Vero E6 cells. Kao et al. 109 identified 18 small molecules that targeted S protein-ACE2-mediated viral entry. One of these, VE607, exhibits potent inhibitory activity on SARS pseudovirus entry into ACE2-expressing 293T cells. These reports suggest that the small molecules discussed above can function as effective antiviral inhibitors against S protein-mediated viral entry. However, further studies are needed to determine the in vivo efficacy of these antiviral agents in animal models and select optimal formulations to deliver effective concentrations of the drugs to the target tissues.",

It has been demonstrated that siRNAs directed against S sequences of SARS-CoV inhibited SARS-CoV replication in virus-infected Vero E6 cells 112 . Several research groups [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] reported that S-specific siRNAs could reduce S protein expression by blocking S mRNA accumulation or reducing the number of copies of the viral genome in FRhK4 cells, indicating that S gene expression in SARS-CoV-infected cells can be effectively silenced by S-specific siRNAs. The in vivo study used a rhesus macaque model to indicate that siRNA duplexes (siSC2-5) that targeted the S protein and ORF1b of SARS-CoV could suppress SARS-like symptoms, inhibit virus replication in the monkey respiratory tract and protect lungs from acute damage 118 . The findings discussed above reveal the function of siRNA in the inhibition of SARS-CoV infection, replication and/or interruption of S gene expression, raising hopes for the development of effective, novel antiviral agents against SARS-CoV.",

Many class I fusion proteins, such as HIV Env, influenza HA and MHV S, are posttranslationally cleaved at the N-proximal region of the fusion peptide by specific proteases into the surface and transmembrane subunits. By contrast, cleavage of the SARS-CoV S protein may occur far upstream of the predicted fusion peptide (fig. 2a) . unlike the S proteins of coronaviruses cleaved by furin-like proteases, the S protein of SARS-CoV can be cleaved by cathepsin L at position T678 or by trypsin at R667. In contrast to the entrance mechanism of HIV, SARS-CoV can enter cells from an acidic environment of the endosome 119 . Nevertheless, SARS-CoV can also enter the target cell surface, which is mediated by proteases on the cell surface through a non-endosomal-dependent pathway 120 .",

Further understanding of the tropism of the virus and the mechanism of the SARS-CoV S protein in receptor binding and entry is therefore important for the development of anti-SARS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines.",

Owing to the absence of human SARS cases in recent years, future SARS epidemics will probably originate from zoonotic transmission. SARS vaccines should therefore protect against not only human SARS-CoV strains, including those from early, middle and late phases of the epidemic, but also those of zoonotic origin. Although current vaccine candidates effectively neutralize SARS-CoV in young-animal replication models without clinical symptoms, they may not protect an elderly population against SARS-CoV infection. Thus, it is essential to test the vaccine candidates in robust lethal-challenge models using aged animals. Future vaccines should effectively protect both the young and the elderly populations from infection by either human or animal SARS-CoV strains that may cause future SARS epidemics.",

Furthermore, the possibility of enhancing viral entry might restrict mAbs as immunotherapeutics for long-term use. It is likely, however, that S protein-based vaccines will bear fruit in the near future, as they have been proven to induce long-term and potent neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV. But the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in elderly and lethal-challenge models, and their protection against zoonotic virus infection, should be determined before a clinical study is initiated. To take these factors into full consideration, a combination of different strategies with multiple vaccines and antiviral therapeutics may be needed to induce broad and cross protection against various virus strains, especially isolates that have mutated quickly. Early clinical studies that were based on such strategies have been carried out, but it is difficult to push the clinical trials of these candidate vaccines and therapeutics forwards owing to a lack of SARS-CoV-infected subjects and insufficient financial support. Thus, most big pharmaceutical companies have no interest in developing SARS vaccines and therapeutics because of the concern of profitability. However, studies on SARS will provide important information for designing novel strategies for prophylaxis and therapies of other newly emerging infections caused by enveloped viruses with class I fusion proteins.",
