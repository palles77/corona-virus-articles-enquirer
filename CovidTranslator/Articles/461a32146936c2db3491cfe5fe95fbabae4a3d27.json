The name COVID-19 (acronym for \"coronavirus disease 2019\") was coined on the 11 th of February 2020 to describe presentation with severe acute respiratory disease (2). COVID-19 is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus belongs to the family of single stranded RNA viruses some of which have been previously described to be responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (3, 4) . Although the symptoms and clinical presentation of COVID-19 is similar to SARS and MERS, the rate of spread is greater (5) . As of 25 th of March 2020, the total number of confirmed case of COVID-19 stands at 459,419 with 20,818 deaths globally and the number is projected to increase (6) .",

COPD is a complex disease associated with abnormalities of the airway and/ or alveoli which is predominantly caused by exposure to noxious gases and particulates over a long period (7). With a global prevalence of 251 million cases in 2016, and 3.17 million (5%) deaths in 2015 alone, COPD was ranked by the WHO as the third leading cause of death especially with a particular burden in low-and middle-income countries (8, 9) . This burden is predicted to grow due mainly to increased global exposure to tobacco, aging populations, poor awareness and inadequate access to diagnosis (10) . COPD exacerbations are a major event in the natural history of the disease associated with worsening of symptoms often resulting in hospitalisation and poor prognosis (11) . Various factors have been described to contribute to acute worsening of COPD, however, viral infection remains the main trigger, including seasonal coronaviruses (12) (13) (14) .",

This concurs with pre-print studies that found similarly high mortality rates (35, (44) (45) (46) (47) . Despite the small number of patients that were analysed, this increases concerns about the prognosis of this vulnerable population. However, this high mortality rate could be attributed to several factors. The majority of COPD patients have various comorbidities that may also be associated with mortality and related conditions may have been underreported because of the difficulties finding the specific cause of mortality (48) . Moreover, in patients with severe COPD, respiratory failure is the principal cause of mortality and this demands ICU intervention. It is possible that limited access to respiratory support as part of COVID-19 management may be contributing to this mortality, dependent on critical care capacity in each hospital or region. According to a recent COVID-19 report from Italy, the surge in patients requiring intensive care has been unmanageable, with 12% of positive cases requiring ICU admission (49) , more than that reported in China (18, 28). As a consequence, patients were dying because mechanical ventilation could not be offered, on top of acute shortage of clinicians who were able to manage those patients (50, 51) . Until now, the particular mechanisms of how COVID-19 increases COPD severity and mortality is .

A recent systematic review on COVID-19 and smoking including five studies found that smoking was most likely associated with the negative outcomes. This recommended further research to explore this in more detail due to limited studies (32) . Evidence from other respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, has shown that inhaled tobacco smoke raises the transmission rate and severity of viral respiratory tract infections (53) . It seems there is underlying mechanisms behind this prevalence, as smoking has been related to higher expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) (pre-print) (54) . However, as more reports globally from diverse racial and genetic contexts become available, differences in the production of ACE2 can be further evaluated and linked to how they lead to COVID-19 vulnerability in different groups (55) .",
