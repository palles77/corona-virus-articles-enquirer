            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease of human beings in more developed countries. In the USA, for example, there are 250 000-350 000 people with MS, resulting in more than 3000 deaths per year, with an estimated annual morbidity cost of over US$2\u00b75 billion. Most patients with MS are young. A relapsing-remitting course that begins between the ages of 15 years and 50 years is common, although a substantial proportion of patients eventually develop chronic progressive disorder. The plaque, an area of white-matter demyelination, is the pathological hallmark of MS; early in the course of the disorder it is accompanied by inflammation and later by astrogliosis. Active plaques consist of mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates concentrated in perivascular spaces. The inflammatory infiltrates have features consistent with an active infection: T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages or microglia. IgG is found primarily at the periphery of plaques. 1 Although inflammation is generally believed to be a primary feature of demyelination in MS, myelin destruction has recently been reported to occur before inflammation. 2 Thus, endogenous glia, such as microglia or astrocytes, might be a source of injury mediators. 3",

For example, paramyxovirus nucleocapsids were found in brains of patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of both grey and white matter. 4 Shortly after this study, high concentrations of antibody to measles virus were found in the serum and CSF of patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. 5 Within a few years, measles virus was isolated in tissue culture from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis brain explants. 6 Another important discovery was that progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML), a fatal human demyelinating disease characterised by rapidly progressive dementia and motor deficit, was also caused by a virus. Human papovavirus (JC virus) was found in the oligodendrocytes of a patient with PML. JC virus was isolated from PML brain by cocultivation of explanted brain cells with normal human fetal brain. 7 However, infection of rodents with JC virus produced tumours instead of demyelination. PML is the only human demyelinating disease for which a viral cause is known.",

The most likely cause is a virus because more than 90% of patients with MS have high concentrations of IgG, manifest as oligoclonal bands, in the brain and CSF. Most chronic inflammatory CNS disorders are infectious. More indirect evidence that MS is caused by a virus is the association of several viruses with demyelinating encephalomyelitis in human beings, and the induction of demyelination in animals infected with viruses in research. Nevertheless, no virus has been isolated from the brains of patients who had MS. Molecular analysis of IgG gene specificity in the brain and CSF of those with MS has shown features of an antigen-driven response: clonal amplification and extensive somatic mutations.

Epidemiological studies of MS have found a geographical pattern of increasing prevalence with increasing latitude north and south of the equator. This pattern of prevalence led to the question of whether MS would be affected by migration between regions with high and low prevalence. Earlier migration studies suggested that the risk of acquiring MS is largely established before age 15 years, but more recent studies suggest that the risk may happen over many years and is not restricted to childhood and early adult life. 12, 13 Analysis of the data on MS from the Faroe Islands suggested a point-source epidemic acquired over a wide age range, 14 but the data have been challenged. 15 Two possibilities explain the epidemiological data. The \"prevalence\" hypothesis of MS suggests that the disease is most common where the causative agent is most widespread. By contrast, the \"polio\" hypothesis suggests that acquisition of early in life (eg, maternal antibody or that produced after infection in infancy) reduces the likelihood that the agent will ever reach the CNS, but that primary infection after puberty or in adult life results in a small incidence of CNS infection, leading to MS. 16 ",

Dyment and colleagues 21 incorrectly rejected the hypothesis that MS could be viral; they reasoned that, because the frequency of MS in adopted relatives was no higher than would be expected, the disorder is not caused by a virus. First, in almost all viral infections of the CNS, the ratio of cases to infections is low. For example, poliomyelitis and postinfectious measles encephalomyelitis occur in one person per 500-2000 people infected. The risk of acquiring MS in an environment shared with adopted (non-biological) relatives would be expected to be the same as in the general population (1 in 1000) because the disorder to infection ratio of MS is likely to be low, and the period over which MS is acquired is probably decades. 13 Accordingly, the frequency of MS in adopted relatives would not be expected to rise above that in the general population if the disease were caused by a virus. Indeed, that is what Dyment and colleagues 21 found. Thus, their interpretation that MS is not infectious because there was no difference between adoptees and their relatives is flawed. The high risk of MS in siblings and twins is most probably due to a combination of virus infection superimposed on a predisposing genetic background. Even in models of demyelination in mice produced by Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, there is a crucial genetic component. For example, after infection with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus caused by injection of the virus into the brain, demyelination develops in SJL/J mice, but not in C57 black mice. Therefore, there seems to be a genetic predisposition to MS, but there is no genetic disorder in which the brain and CSF contain oligoclonal bands.",

However, many viruses might produce demyelination, as suggested by the temporal association of postinfectious encephalomyelitis after smallpox vaccination, or after measles, and also varicella or rubella infection.

The most studied experimental demyelination is infection of mice with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, 22 but CNS demyelination in the host occurs after infection of mice with JHM or MHV-4 (coronaviruses), dogs with canine distemper virus, and sheep and goats with Visna virus and caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus. Each of these viruses is capable of establishing a persistent infection in their host, such that there is continuous virus replication over a long period without killing the host. The replicative capacity of such viruses could be attenuated or restricted in the cells they infect to prevent elimination by the immune system. These RNA viruses are under intense study by many laboratories to elucidate the relation of virus persistence to demyelination. Figure 2 shows a possible mechanism of demyelination produced by persistence of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. 23 Some researchers have argued that more than one infectious agent might cause MS because there are various degrees of inflammation and demyelination. However, some chronic infectious disorders of the CNS that are caused by a single agent also have different pathologies. For example, in neurosyphilis, patients can have diffuse parenchymatous disease (general paresis), infection and inflammation restricted to cerebral arteries (meningovascular syphilis), isolated involvement of the optic nerve (syphilitic optic atrophy), lesions in only the posterior roots and columns (tabes dorsalis), or a solitary mass lesion (a syphilitic gumma). The same organism, Treponema pallidum, causes all these forms of neurosyphilis. Similarly, in some patients with MS perivascular inflammation is prominent; others have little more than optic atrophy, or may even develop a solitary demyelinating lesion that mimics tumour. Besides T pallidum, other organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and various fungi can produce chronic CNS disease with differing pathologies. Thus, a more reasonable hypothesis is that a single infectious agent causes MS.",

The lack of MS-brain IgG specificity for abnormal or healthy brain seems inconsistent with autoantigen involvement in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Although the viral hypothesis is not supported by binding inability, the putative MS virus might be latent and of low abundance in the brain. During virus latency in the nervous system, infectious virus is not produced, and viral gene expression is limited. For example, herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus are both latent in human ganglia, and antibody against either virus does not bind to human ganglia. However, latent virus can produce clinical disease on reactivation by unknown stimuli.

Both measles and papovavirus had been identified from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and PML brain, and the transmissibility of two degenerative neurological diseases (kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) have been shown. Brain cells from patients with MS were propagated in tissue culture by the same techniques as are used to grow ganglia and to rescue herpes simplex virus from human trigeminal, 24 nodose, and vagus ganglia. 25 Although only glial cells and brain fibroblasts, but not neurons, in tissue culture survived subcultivation, 26,27 sufficient quantities of brain cells from patients with MS were generated. Initially, these cells were mixed with indicator cells (lung fibroblasts and kidney cells) in tissue culture, because the latter cells allow many viruses and other microorganisms to propagate readily and might permit replication and eventual isolation even if replication of an infectious agent in MS brain cells in tissue culture is restricted. However, cocultivation of MS brain cells in tissue culture with indicator cells did not lead to a cytopathic effect characteristic of any infectious agent.",

In cell fusion, a fusing agent brings the membranes of two cells together to produce a heterokaryon (a cell containing different nuclei inside a common cytoplasm). Use of inactivated Sendai virus (a parainfluenza virus) as the fusing agent and pH 7\u00b70, which had been shown to be optimum for heterokaryon production, led to the isolation of a parainfluenza virus (6/94 virus) from brains from patients with MS. 28 However, 6/94 virus did not prove to be the cause of MS. Furthermore, because Sendai virus is a parainfluenza virus, it might not have been completely inactivated. Lysolecithin and eventually polyethylene glycol were tried as the fusing agent. Cells from the brains of many patients with MS were fused with indicator cells. The explanted MS brain cells were assessed before and after cell fusion, not only for a spontaneous cytopathic effect, but also for binding to measles virus, herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus), coxsackie and ECHO viruses, rubella, influenza A and B, and coronaviruses by indirect immunofluorescence with various antisera. Explanted and fused MS brain cells were also inoculated into embryonated hen eggs, in which influenza and parainfluenza viruses are readily propagated, and into rodent species and chimpanzees in an attempt to produce neurological disease. Although no agent specific for MS was found, an endogenous mouse picornavirus (the WW strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus) that produces demyelination was isolated. 27 In addition, one chimpanzee inoculated intracerebrally with MS brain cells developed demyelinating disease, and cytomegalovirus was subsequently isolated from the brain of this animal; 29 the virus was identified as a chimpanzee strain of cytomegalovirus. 30 Inoculation of both chimpanzee and mouse with brain xenografts (MS cells) induced reactivation of an endogenous virus that can cause demyelination. Overall, virus was not found in the brain of any of the patients analysed. 31 A pseudotype virus might be latent in the brain in MS. Weiss and co-workers 32 showed that cells in tissue culture containing an enveloped virus and superinfected with vesicular stomatitis virus (varicella zoster virus) produced a pseudotype virus. The pseudotype or \"transvestite\" virus contained the genome of one virus and the protein coat of the second. The pseudotype virus was shown by a small virus fraction resistant to antibody against varicella zoster virus that was completely neutralised by antiserum to the second virus. To investigate the possibility of a latent enveloped virus in the brain in MS, brain cells from patients with MS in culture were infected with varicella zoster virus. When a cytopathic effect appeared, the cells were harvested and assayed for a varicella zoster virus non-neutralisable fraction, however, no enveloped virus latent in MS brain cells was found.",

However, high titres of antibody to C pneumoniae in the CSF of patients with MS were not significantly correlated with disease duration, disease course, clinical or MRI disease activity, disability, or presence of oligoclonal IgG. 34 Overall, many studies have assessed a possible relation between C pneumoniae and MS but none have found one. 35 Further, an organism larger than a virus (eg, a rickettsial agent or a bacterium) is unlikely to have been missed by the many electron microscopists who have assessed MS plaques ultrastructurally.",

Interestingly, when cellular, instead of cell-free CSF was analysed, HHV-6 DNA was detected in 29% of controls with other neurological diseases, 41% of patients with HIV infection, and 39% of patients with MS. 36 This finding suggests that any association between HHV-6 and MS is attributable to virus in cells that were part of the inflammatory infiltrate. Support for this notion comes from analyses of 36 patients with MS, 27 with AIDSrelated neurological disease, and 24 with noninflammatory disease, which found HHV-6 DNA in 30-40% of CSF in all groups in which pleiocytosis was present, but no difference in HHV-6 antibody titres between patients with MS (including those in different disease stages) and controls. 47 Further studies applied in-situ hybridisation combined with PCR to tissue sections fixed with formalin. HHV-6 DNA, but not antigen-positive cells, was found in 11 of 13 sections from eight brain specimens, mostly in oligodendrocytes. 48 Laser microdissection was used to isolate tissue from plaques and normal-appearing white matter from the brains of 13 patients with MS, after which nested PCR amplified the HHV-6 major capsid protein gene. The HHV genome was detected in 16-27% of normal-appearing white matter from patients with MS, samples from healthy people, and samples from patients with other neurological disorders, whereas the HHV-6 genome was detected in 57% of plaques from patients with MS, a difference that was highly significant. There were no statistically significant differences among the groups when only HHV-6-positive patients were included. 49 Overall, HHV-6 DNA and increased concentrations of antibody to HHV-6 in blood and CSF have been found in only a minority of patients with MS. Furthermore, HHV-6 DNA and increased concentrations of HHV-6 antibody occur in patients with other neurological diseases.

The summary odds ratio for patients with MS comparing EBV-seropositive with EBV-seronegative individuals was 13\u00b75 (95% CI 6\u00b73-31\u00b74), a finding that the investigators believed supported a role for EBV in the cause of MS. 51 Bray and colleagues 52 found antibodies to the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen in 85% of patients with MS compared with 13% of EBV-seropositive controls. Furthermore, a prospective serological study of 62 439 women 53 found substantial increases in serum titres of anti-EBV before the onset of MS, particularly antibody to the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2. An unexpected finding was the late onset of disease in most of the women who developed MS (median age 52 years). Unfortunately, no CSF data were available; such data are important because the IgG in MS brain and CSF is synthesised intrathecally and might reflect the immune response at the site of disease. The strongest predictors of MS were serum concentrations of IgG antibodies to the EBV viral capsid antigen or the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen complex. 54 Finally, because strong associations between EBV antibodies and the risk of MS were already apparent from samples collected from patients with MS 5 years or more before onset of disease, late EBV infection could have a role in MS. 55 Overall, the neurotropism of EBV and its ability to produce serious neurological disease at all parts of the human nervous system have been documented. 56 However, no studies have attempted to show that the oligoclonal IgG in brain and CSF in MS is directed against EBV, and in-situ hybridisation did not find EBVspecific RNA in brains from ten individuals with MS. 57",

A relation between sexual permissiveness and MS prevalence has been proposed, and infection with HTLV-1, a disorder with some features in common with MS, can be transmitted sexually. The sexual transmission hypothesis could be assessed with a casecontrol study of patients with MS and their partners, and by studies of MS in social groups adhering to a strict moral code, such as Mormons or nuns. 58 Many researchers have searched for retrovirus sequences in MS brain. Jocher and co-workers 59 found no HTLV-1 sequences in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells or brain of patients with MS, and a large masked PCR study of several populations did not find HTLV-1. 60 Concentrations of antibody to reverse transcriptase of human retroviruses have been found to differ substantially between patients with MS and controls, 61 but Rozenberg and colleagues 62 used three sets of oligonucleotides, which detect all known human oncoretroviruses or lentiviruses, and found none in patients with MS or controls. Further studies did not find retrovirus in serum, CSF, or blood mononuclear cells of patients with MS. 63 However, Rasmussen and coworkers 64 compared peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from 22 patients with MS with those of matched healthy donors and five patients with other CNS disease; samples of brain were also studied. Several endogenous retrovirus sequences were transcribed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and brain from patients with MS and controls. The significance of these findings is unknown. At the same time, Perron and co-workers 65 repeatedly isolated a novel retrovirus (LM7) from the leptomeninges, choroid plexus, and EBV-immortalised B cells of patients with MS. The same sequences were also detected in non-cellular RNA from plasma of patients with MS and in CSF from untreated patients with MS. Further epidemiological studies are needed to elucidate the apparent association of retroviruses with MS.",

We know that DNA is transcribed into RNA, and that RNA becomes protein. The continuous production of increased amounts of IgG in the brain (figure 1) and CSF in MS suggest the presence of an antigen (probably a protein) against which the IgG is directed. The RNA from which this protein was translated could be used to identify the putative unique MS antigen. RNA can be readily extracted from the brain of patients with MS. Although RNA degrades quickly, it can be reverse-transcribed into cDNA, which are stable molecules. There are many methods by which cDNA libraries of a brain, containing all genes expressed in that brain, can be used to identify genes and RNA unique to disease. For example, the ability to prepare and characterise libraries of genes from human tissue has allowed the isolation of cDNA clones derived from hepatitis C virus (HCV) without prior knowledge of the virus, the viral genome, or the presence of circulating viral antibodies. 73 Abundance of HCV-specific RNA in total liver RNA of infected animals is 0\u00b700001%. 73 Combined cloning in expression vectors (even without subtraction hybridisation) and immunological screening of about a million recombinant phages (prepared from a cDNA library derived from infectious material and constructed in bacteriophage) led to the identification of an HCV-specific antigen.",

Cloning of IgG in brain and CSF in MS has shown over-represented (identical) heavy-chain sequences expressed at many plaque sites. 74 Normally, the sequence of every heavy-chain and light-chain antibody is different. Alignment of the heavy-chain sequences to their closest germline counterparts showed clonal amplification and extensive somatic mutationfeatures of an antigen-driven response. 74, 75 Comparison of the IgG heavy-chain sequences in MS and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis again showed features of an antigen-driven response in both diseases. Because the antigen in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is known to be measles virus, the parallel findings in MS suggest an antigen-driven immune response 76 rather than a non-conventional mechanism of B-cell activation. Furthermore, the antigen-driven clonal B-lymphocyte and plasma-cell response has been found after a single clinically isolated syndrome, 77, 78 which suggests that detection of the disease-relevant antigens in early CNS demyelination may bear on the inciting antigens in MS. Further analysis of the specificity of IgG in brain and CSF has the potential to identify an infectious agent in MS.",

TMEV infection of oligodendrocytes is productive, resulting in cell lysis and liberation of more virions (bottom). By contrast, TMEV infection in macrophages is restricted, and results in apoptosis of macrophages.23 TMEV antigen is abundant in the cytoplasm of apoptotic macrophages (top centre). Small amounts of TMEV are liberated from persistently infected macrophages leading to infection of more macrophages as well as oligodendrocytes. A persistent CNS infection is established as virus spreads from macrophage to macrophage (across top). Virus released from macrophages can infect and kill more oligodendrocytes, thus adding to immunopathological destruction of myelin.",
