The complex structure of GspSA(C59A)_ADP_Gsp is a homodimer, and each monomer contains the N-terminal amidase and C-terminal synthetase domains connected by a linker in between. The overall structure shares nearly identical folding with the previously reported GspSA (wild-type) structure (with the RMSD value of 2.0 \u00c5 ), 11 and the relative orientation of the two separate domains does not show obvious difference. Interestingly, the GspSA_Gsp complex was formed during crystal growth by addition of the substrates for the synthetase domain, that is, GSH, spermidine, ATP, and Mg 2\u00fe . The resulting structure contained GSP in the GspA domain active site and the product ADP in the GspS domain active site [ Fig. 1(B) ]. On the other hand, the amidase domain structure, GspA(C59A)_Gsp, is a monomer showing similar folding to the amidase domain of the GspSA-(C59A)_ADP_Gsp structure with the RMSD value of 0.36 \u00c5 (Supporting Information Fig. S1 ) and contains the substrate, Gsp, bound in the active site [ Fig. 1(A) ].

These residues of catalytic triad interact with each other, that is, NE2 of His131 forms the hydrogen bond Fig. 1(A) ]. This region is somewhat disordered and appears with high B factors, suggesting its flexibility and the possibility of regulating the substrate entry. In the substrate binding structure (GspA(C59A)_Gsp), this helix-loop region appears to adopt a ''more closed'' form than the closed form of the apo GspSA structure (Fig. 3) , and additional interactions were thus observed. Hydroxyl group of Tyr30 interacts with the Nd atom of Asn149 and the Ne atom of Gln58, and a water molecule also interacts with the Oe atom of Gln58. In addition, the OH group of Tyr38 forms a hydrogen bond with the Ne atom of Gln58 [ Fig. 2 ",

The distances between the Sc atom of Cys59 and the side chains of Val132, Val60, and Ala81 are 3.8, 3.9, and 4.2 \u00c5 , respectively. Like papain, the catalytic Cys, Cys580, of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protease Ulp1 can be oxidized to sulfenic, sulfinic, and sulfonic acids. 19 According to the structural comparison of GspA-sulfenic acid and Ulp1-sulfenic acid, obviously the space around the sulfenic acid of Ulp1 is wider than that of GspA, and there is no hydrophobic patch near Cys580 of Ulp1 unlike GspA (Supporting Information Figs. S5B vs. S5D). This evidence accounts for the limited oxidation occurring in the Cys59 of GspA. Superimposing the Ulp1 structures with cysteine-sulfenic and cysteine-sulfonic acids reveals that both Trp448 and His514 shift closer to the cysteine-sulfonic acid than to the cysteine-sulfenic acid (Supporting Information Figs.

            "text": "The bifunctional E. coli GspSA, which catalyzes both the synthesis and hydrolysis of Gsp, has been of interest for its implications in human disease and bacterial cell maintenance and metabolism. 1 Importantly, we have identified an essential role of the amidase domain in the hydrolysis of Gsp that ultimately enables the reduction of Gsp-S-S-Gsp and Gsp-S-protein adducts, 12 Gsp part (in the Gsp-mixed disulfide) hanging outside the Gsp-binding cavity. In this way, any larger Gsp-S-protein adducts would be able to fit into the GspA binding cavity without major disruption to the rest of its structure. In E. coli, the two activity domains of GspSA are regulated to avoid the futile consumption of ATP. The structures of GspSA and GspA clearly indicate that the entrance of the amidase active site, which is near the synthetase domain, is more accessible when the synthetase domain is absent [ Fig. 1(A) vs.  1(B) ]. Therefore, this observation suggests the synthetase domain plays a role in negatively regulating the amidase activity and supports the previous study by Lin et al. 20 In contrast, a significant conformational change was noticed in the helix-loop region of GspA at sequence 30-42 in comparison with the apo form of GspSA (Fig. 3) . This helix-loop region of GspA is near the substrate binding cavity and thus narrows the substrate entry upon binding to the substrate, that is, Gsp; this ''more closed form'' would probably increase binding affinity to Gsp. In particular, the residues of this helix-loop are mostly negatively charged [ Fig. 1(A) , right), which attract and facilitate binding with positively charged spermidine that holds the helix-loop and substrate tunnel in the arrangement observed [ Fig. 1(A) ]. These indicate that this helix-loop plays a role in regulating the substrate entry and thus possibly affects the binding affinity to the substrate and finally its activity. Furthermore, Tyr30 and Tyr38, both in the helix-loop, participate in hydrogen bonding with Asn149 and Gln58 [ Fig. 2(A) , right]. It appears that on binding of the substrate the helix-loop region moves in to interact with the substrate; most likely facilitating catalysis via the additional interactions. Because of the functional role of Asn149 and Gln58 in the catalysis (see below), these observations suggest that the mobile helix-loop region is likely in association with the regulation of the amidase activity, in addition to the aforementioned regulation caused by the synthetase domain. As the helix-loop plays a role in regulation of the amidase activity, mutating Tyr30 and/or Tyr38 or removing the flexible helix-loop would probably abolish the interaction with the substrate then decrease binding affinity to the substrate and finally decrease the amidase's catalysis. Certainly, this analysis would be a great experimental support to our hypotheses. Surprisingly, this helix is absent in the closely related structure of L. major TryS amidase domain [Figs. 3, Supporting Information Fig. S3 vs. 4(A) and Fig. 4(B) ], explaining that such regulation by a helix of the amidase activity is unique to E. coli GspA. In contrast, in L. major trypanothione synthetase-amidase (TSA) the C-terminus, which blocks the amidase active site, provides the mechanism to regulate its activity whereby a conformational change is required to vacate the active site for substrate binding. 14 Our complex structures provide further insight explaining how the catalytic machinery operates to hydrolytically cleave the amide bond. Cys59, His131, and Glu147 form the catalytic triad; the resulting Cys59-His131 thiolate-imidazolium pair is oriented by a hydrogen bond to the Glu147 carboxylate (Fig. 2) . Such interactions enhance the nucleophilicity of Cys59 to attack the isopeptide bond between GSH and spermidine to yield a tetrahedral intermediate, followed by formation of the acyl-S-enzyme intermediate (covalent catalysis) as do serine and cysteine proteases [ Fig. 2(B) ]. The high reactivity of Cys59 is further supported by its low pKa value of 3.05 that is calculated and predicted by using the PROPKA (web interface 2.0, http://propka.ki.ku.dk/). 21, 22 Spermidine is liberated upon formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. The subsequent hydrolysis of the acylenzyme intermediate releases GSH from the enzyme and, thus, completes the catalytic reaction [ Fig. 2(B) ]. The catalytic-related residues, Gln58, Cys59, and Asn149, are highly conserved in the CHAP family. 23 In this aspect, both Asn149 and Gln58 have dual roles in the catalysis. First, they form H-bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of the cleaved amide bond to make the amide a better electrophile, that is, more vulnerable to the nucleophilic attack by the thiol of Cys59. Second, Asn149 and Gln58 also form an oxyanion hole, which refers to the accommodation of the negative potential formed on the carbonyl oxygen atom at the scissile bond on binding to the substrate to stabilize the tetrahedral intermediate before the formation of an acyl-enzyme adduct.",

This explains how the substrate specificity defines in spite of similar active sites. Taken together, a variety of cysteine proteases share a common catalytic mechanism that involves the conserved catalytic triad, indicating a convergent evolution of their active sites, but with development of their own substrate specificity.",

            "text": "We reported previously that a sulfenic acid forms in the thiol of Cys59 of GspA by H 2 O 2 oxidation. 12 Because sulfenic acid is labile and easily undergoes further oxidation to generate irreversible higher oxidation states, including sulfinic and sulfonic acids, it is interesting to identify what distinct features of GspA are correlated with the stability of Cys59-sulfenic acid. The comparison of the active site of GspA with those of papain cysteine protease (PDB: 9PAP) and SUMO protease Ulp1 shows how GspA functions to operate during oxidative stress. The electrostatic surface shows that the entry of substrate channel of GspA formed by the hydrophobic residues is narrower than those of papain and Ulp1 (Supporting Information Figs. S5A, S5B vs. S5C, S5D, and S5E). Interestingly, the space around the sulfonic acid of Cys580 of Ulp1 is more limited than that of the sulfenic acid of Cys580 (Supporting Information Figs. S5D vs. S5E), indicating that the environment of Cys59-sulfenic acid mimics that of Cys508-sulfonic acid. Therefore, the hydrophobicity and the crowded space likely make it difficult for the excessive access of H 2 O 2 , revealing a correlation between the surrounding environment of cysteine and the corresponding oxidation state. Meanwhile, the life of Cys59-sulfenic acid is sustained by these steric and intramolecular-bonding factors, 26 which impede further oxidation on the Sc atom of Cys59. More importantly, the unusually short hydrogen bonding interaction that is contributed by an adjacent water molecule stabilizes the Cys59-sulfenic acid in GspA and makes it stable enough to resist further oxidation. 12 The structural data demonstrated that GspA has more interactions with the GSH moiety of Gsp than it does with the spermidine moiety [ Fig. 2(A) and Table II] ; as a result, it would be better to mimic the former interactions when developing GspA inhibitors. This is supported by the previous study that c-Glu-Ala-Gly-aldehyde is a potent timedependent specific inhibitor of the amidase activity. 27 Intriguingly, the sulfhydryl group of Gsp faces outward and does not form any interactions with GspA [ Figs. 1(A) and 2(A) , left]. Therefore, we can modify this group (e.g., replacement of Cys with Ala) without disrupting any interaction with the enzyme.",
