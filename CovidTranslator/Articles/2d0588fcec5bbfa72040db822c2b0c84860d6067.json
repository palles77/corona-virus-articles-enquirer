For the paramyxoviruses, the fusion (F) protein catalyses this membrane merger and entry step, and it has been postulated that the F protein undergoes complex refolding during this process. Here we report the crystal structure of the parainfluenza virus 5 F protein in its prefusion conformation, stabilized by the addition of a carboxy-terminal trimerization domain. The structure of the F protein shows that there are profound conformational differences between the pre-and postfusion states, involving transformations in secondary and tertiary structure. The positions and structural transitions of key parts of the fusion machinery, including the hydrophobic fusion peptide and two helical heptad repeat regions, clarify the mechanism of membrane fusion mediated by the F protein.",

The attachment proteins interact with different cellular receptors. For example, SV5 HN protein binds sialic acid, measles virus H protein interacts with CD46 or CDw150/SLAM (refs 4, 5) , Nipah and Hendra virus G proteins bind to Ephrin B2 (refs 6, 7) and RSV G protein binds heparin sulphate 8 .

The uncleaved precursor (F 0 ) is processed into a larger carboxy-terminal fragment (F 1 ) and a smaller amino-terminal fragment (F 2 ).

Subsequent refolding and assembly of HRA and HRB into a six-helix bundle (6HB) occurs, placing the fusion peptides and the transmembrane domains in proximity 13, 17 . Formation of the 6HB and the associated free-energy change are tightly linked to merger of the viral and cellular membranes 16, 18 . The isolated F 6HB structure, generated from HRA and HRB peptides 17, 19 , is stable up to 100 8C and is thought to represent the lowest-energy conformation of the protein after membrane fusion. We previously reported the structure of the uncleaved, secreted hPIV3 F 0 ectodomain (solF0), truncated before the transmembrane domain 20 . Unexpectedly, this structure contains the postfusion 6HB, indicating that F protein cleavage is not required to attain the postfusion conformation and that the F transmembrane domain and/or the cytoplasmic tail are important for the folding to, or stability of, the prefusion metastable state 20 . It remained unclear to what extent the F pre-and postfusion conformations differ 21, 22 and how these are linked to membrane fusion.",

The structure contains a globular head attached to a trimeric coiled-coil stalk formed by the C-terminal HRB region. The globular head contains three domains (DI-DIII) identified previously 20, 21 . DI and DII reposition as rigid modules during the conformational transition, and the main refolding occurs in DIII. Core structural elements of DIII act as a scaffold for the folding of HRA, preventing its assembly into the postfusion helical conformation. The fusion peptides at the N termini of HRA segments are sequestered between adjacent subunits, and cleavage/ activation sites are exposed at the protein surface. None of the intersubunit contacts are conserved in the pre-and postfusion forms. The SV5 F structure provides a model for the stepwise induction of membrane fusion by paramyxoviruses and shows how several sequence elements have distinct structural roles in the preand postfusion conformations.",

In the prefusion conformation, HRA is folded around the DIII core. The globular form of the prefusion DIII suggests that the HRA conformation is trapped as monomeric subunits fold during F biosynthesis. In the prefusion form, HRA helical segments cover both sides of the DIII core b-strands (Fig. 3b) , which also form a mixed parallel/ antiparallel five-stranded sheet with the two HRA b-strands, b1 and b2 (Fig. 3c, e) . In the postfusion form, the HRA b1 and b2 b-strands are replaced by a b-strand from the HRB linker of a neighbouring subunit. The HRB linker also forms an additional two-stranded b-sheet with DIII residues preceding HRC (Fig. 3d, f) .

This pre-hairpin intermediate has been trapped and co-precipitated with HRB-peptides 16 . Removal of the fusion peptide from the intersubunit interfaces would enable an inward swing of DII and the formation of new contacts with DI of a neighbouring subunit, compacting the head. The refolding of DIII HRA would also expose its core b-sheet and, together with the inward movement of DII, enable the HRB linker (at the C terminus of DII) to form parallel b-strands with the DIII core, probably preceding and initiating the final positioning of HRB (Fig. 5) . The assembly of the final 6HB completes the conformational change and membrane merger. Although proteolytic cleavage of the F protein is required for membrane fusion activity, it is apparently not required for formation of the postfusion conformation. The role of the HN or H protein in stimulating the F conformational change remains to be elucidated, but it could exert effects by, for example, influencing the stability of the F prefusion stalk in a receptor-dependent manner.",

The folding of metastable proteins, as well as their activation, is not well understood but is a hallmark of class I viral fusion proteins such as F, influenza virus HA and HIV Env 12 . The F structural changes are very different from those observed in influenza virus HA 12 , which is the only other class I viral fusion protein for which we have both pre-and postfusion structures 37, 38 . However, new and potentially general concepts for these protein machines emerge from a comparison of the F and HA fusion proteins: first, in the metastable state, the N-terminal (fusionpeptide-proximal) HRA segment is prevented from assembling into the postfusion coiled-coil structure; second, the fusion peptide is initially buried at subunit interfaces that undergo considerable reorganization between the pre-and postfusion states; third, refolding of HRA projects the fusion peptide away from the initial positions of the transmembrane anchors and viral membrane; and last, the C-terminal HRB region is prevented from adopting its final state both by the absence of the HRA coiled coil and by other inhibitory structural elements present in the prefusion conformation. For HIV Env, it is tempting to speculate that the gp120 'inner' domain, which switches conformation between the free and receptor-bound states, could act similarly to the F DIII core by regulating the folding of the HRA segment of HIV gp41 (refs 39, 40) . The strategy of stabilizing the prefusion F conformation with GCNt may prove to be important for the elucidation of other viral fusion protein mechanisms.",

In brief, complementary DNA encoding a form of the SV5 (W3A strain) F protein (FR3) in which the furin cleavage site had been mutated to prevent intracellular processing 41 was cloned into pMelBac (Invitrogen) by standard PCR protocols. A soluble form of F was generated that contained the honeybee melittin signal sequence in place of the F signal sequence and, at the C terminus, an isoleucine zipper domain (GCNt) 23, 42 in heptad repeat phase with HRB, followed by a factor Xa cleavage site and a His 6 tag. The nucleotide sequence of the construct was obtained with a 3100-Avant sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Recombinant baculovirus was generated with a Bac-N-Blue transfection kit (Invitrogen).

HRB is blue, HRA is green, and DI, DII and DIII are yellow, red and magenta, respectively. b, 'Open stalk' conformation, in which the HRB stalk melts and separates from the prefusion head region. HRB is shown as three extended chains because the individual segments are unlikely to be helical. This conformation is consistent with a lowtemperature intermediate that is inhibited by HRA peptides, but not HRB peptides. Mutations of the switch peptide residues 443, 447 and 449 would influence the formation of this intermediate by affecting stabilizing interactions between the prefusion stalk and head domains (see Fig. 4 ). c, A pre-hairpin intermediate can form by refolding of DIII, facilitating formation of the HRA coiled coil and insertion of the fusion peptide into the target cell membrane. This intermediate can be inhibited by peptides derived from both HRA and HRB regions. d, Before formation of the final 6HB, folding of the HRB linker onto the newly exposed DIII core, with the formation of additional b-strands (see Fig. 3d , f), may stabilize the juxtaposition of viral and cellular membranes. e, The formation of the postfusion 6HB is tightly linked to membrane fusion and pore formation, juxtaposing the membrane-interacting fusion peptides and transmembrane domains. at 20 8C by the hanging-drop, vapour-diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of protein solution (10 mg ml 21 ) and precipitant (0.9 M sodium potassium tartrate and 0.1 M imidazole; pH 8.0).
