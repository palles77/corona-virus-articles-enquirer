Sequence databases, such as GenBank and EMBL, have been growing at an exponential rate (Venter et al., 1996; Chou, 2002; Chou, 2004) . In general, gene sequences are stored in the computer database system in the form of long character strings. It would act like a snail's pace for human beings to read these sequences with the naked eyes. Also, it is very hard to extract any key features by directly reading these sequences. However, if they can be converted to some diagrams (see, e.g., Chou and Zhang, 1992; Zhang and Chou, 1994) , some important features can automatically manifested and become easily visible.",

Previous effort in biological sequence visualization was focused on single sequence representations. About 20 years ago, the first 3D (dimensional) H curve was proposed to represent a DNA sequence (Hamori, 1985; Hamori and Ruskin, 1983) . Subsequently, a graphic representation of DNA sequences was suggested using Barnsley's iterative function (Jeffrey, 1990) . Later, a different method was proposed thru the iterative function system (Roman-Roldan et al., 1994; Tino, 1999) . By extrapolating the work of Hamori and Jeffrey, a different iterative method called W-curves was presented (Wu et al., 1993) . Meanwhile, a diagrammatical approach for codon usage were also proposed (Chou and Zhang, 1992; Zhang and Chou, 1994) . Gates (1985) proposed a 2D graphical representation that is simpler than the H curve. However, Gates's graphical representation has high degeneracy. Guo took an ulterior step and proposed a novel 2D graphical representation of DNA sequences of low degeneracy (Guo et al., 2001) . In 2003, Yau presented a representation without degeneracy (Yau et al., 2003) .",

The properties of a protein's amino acids may also be visualized in the form of a line graph, for example, protein rhodopsin is showed using the hydropathic scale (Alston et al., 2003) . Chou et al.

A cellular automaton can be thought of as a stylised universe consisting of a regular grid of cells, each of which can be in one of a finite number of k possible states, updated synchronously in discrete time steps according to a local, identical interaction rule (Wolfram, 1986) . Cellular automata provide us an access to model complex dynamical phenomena by reformulating the macroscopic behavior into microscopic and mesoscopic rules that are discrete in space and time. A set of rules specifies the time and space evolution of the system, which is discrete in both variables. These systems have attracted a great deal of interest in recent years because even with very simple rules cellular automata can show very complex evolution patterns. It is recognized that repeated applications of simple rules can lead to extremely complex behavior that can emulate physical, social and biological systems.",

That is to say, 256 different images can be created for a same sequence based on cellular automata. These images can fall into 4 classes. The first class is named balanced, the states of cells been quickly resolved into boring configurations, e.g., all 0 or all 1. The second class is periodic. The third class is of chaos. The fourth class is not disordered, but complex and sometimes long-lived.

Illustration of a one-dimensional, binary-state, nearest-neighbor (r \u00bc 1) cellular automata with N \u00bc 10. Both the lattice and the rule table F for updating the lattice are illustrated. The lattice configuration is shown at two successive time steps. The cellular automaton has spatially periodic boundary conditions: the lattice is viewed as a circle, with the leftmost cell being the right neighbor of the rightmost cell, and vice versa other. By this way, the bases in a gene or residues in a protein must be coupled with each other as an entity. During the process of producing the gene image, the state of cell corresponding to a certain nucleic acid is colligated with both the base prior to it and bases behind it. Because of above-mentioned characteristics, the gene image can reveal some implicit sequence features, and these features are difficult to be displayed by other gene visualizations. We have found that among the 256 evolving rules some is better than the others in building gene image for a given gene.

The images obtained directly by the aforementioned procedures are generally too large for analysis. After the images are zoomed out with the compression ratio 14:2 as showed in Fig. 4 , the images of SARS-CoVs are mainly with the V-shaped cross-lines pattern, whereas those of non-SARS virus RNA sequences are mainly with the parallel slashlines pattern. By analyzing the different parts of the fulllength RNA sequence visualized images, a remarkable fingerprint for the SARS-CoV has been found. It is in some regions of the SARS-CoV sequences near 5 0 -terminal Zhang and Chou, 1996) that the occurrence frequencies of repeated character 'A' (i.e., 'AA', 'AAA', and 'AAAA') are obviously greater than those of repeated character 'U' (i.e., 'UU', 'UUU', and 'UUUU'), respectively. However, for all other coronaviruses, the situation is just opposite in the same region; i.e., the occurrence frequencies of 'AA', 'AAA', and 'AAAA' are obviously less than those of 'UU', 'UUU', and 'UUUU'. Therefore, such a unique feature of SARS-CoV can be defined as its fingerprint. Actually, it was found that the number of individual 'A' in the V-shape region of some SARS gene sequences is approximately equal to the number of individual 'U' according to the statistic result. These segments are from 3232 to 5624 nt, 5703 to 7195 nt, 12128 to 14470 nt, 16444 to 19231 nt, and 17928 to 21803 nt in the SARS-CoV sequence near 5-terminal.
