Through careful inspection of the spleens and lymph nodes (LNs) from six cases with postmortem examinations, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 could directly infect secondary lymphoid organs to induce cell death. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), the potential receptor of SARS-CoV-2, expresses on tissue-resident CD169 + macrophages in spleens and LNs. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed that viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) can be found in ACE2 + cells, CD169 + macrophages, but not in CD3 + T cells or B220 + B cells in spleens and LNs. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces severe tissue damage including lymph follicle depletion, splenic nodule atrophy, histiocyte hyperplasia and lymphocyte reductions.",

Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 also triggers macrophages to produce IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine that directly promotes lymphocyte necrosis.

This novel coronavirus was renamed as the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the consequent disease was designated as coronavirus disease 2019 . 3, 4 According to the daily report of the WHO, the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 has so far caused 81961 laboratory confirmed cases and 3293 death in China. Meanwhile, the number of confirmed COVID-19 and fatalities around the world are 465315 and 21031, respectively, by 26 th March 2020. 5 The importance of the secondary lymphoid organs, including spleen and lymph nodes (LNs), for resistance against infection is well established. Tissue-resident macrophages positioned in the splenic marginal zone (MZ) that are among the first cell types to encounter invading pathogens. 6, 7 Similarly, the resident macrophages of the subcapsular sinus and hilar lymph nodes have been shown to play a protective role against viral infections by capturing viral particles. 8, 9 These macrophages present viral antigens to activate specific T cells, to induce activation, clonal proliferation, and subsequent killing of infected target cells through secretion of perforin, granzyme B, and interferon-\u03b3 etc. [10] [11] [12] Moreover, these activated T cells also egress from spleen and LNs into blood circulation and play immune surveillance roles. 13 Unfortunately, our previous work has shown that lymphocytopenia is prevalent in COVID-19 patients, especially in aged and critically ill cases, suggesting that the immune system from COVID-19 patients might be neutralized by infection. 14 Therefore, understanding the destinies of lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs is critical for understanding SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, and the identification of methods to boost lymphocytes and enhance the host immunity in vivo.",

Moreover, immunofluorescent double staining showed that IL-6 is primarily produced by infected macrophages (Figure 5B ). Increased transcription of several cytokines in macrophages has been described to be activated by SARS-Spike protein. 22, 23 Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS share a highly similar Spike protein based on amino acid sequence, we reasoned that a similar phenomenon might occur with SARS-CoV-2 Spike. We thus treated human macrophage line-THP1 cells with Spike protein in vitro, and found that SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein can trigger increased Il6 expression independently of changes in Il1b and Tnfa gene transcription ( Figure 5C) . Collectively, these results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 viruses and the Spike protein, can trigger macrophages to secrete IL-6, which may accelerate lymphocytopenia.",

From our in situ immunohistochemistry, we showed that viral NP antigen was restricted to the macrophages of the infected tissues, while, human T cells and B cells were negative for viral NP antigen, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 cannot directly infect T and B cells ( Figure 2B ). Most importantly, viral NP + CD68 + macrophages were observed in capillaries of spleens and LNs, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 migrates into spleens and LNs through macrophages. An interesting finding is that overwhelming numbers of NP + cells are observed in red pulp of spleens and within marginal sinus of lymph nodes (Figure 2A) . Previous work have showed that tissue-resident CD169 + macrophages are positioned in the splenic MZ and reside in the subcapsular sinus of LNs. 7, 16 The strategic anatomical positioning of CD169 + macrophages in the spleen and LNs suggest these cells are the first to interact with invading pathogen. Here, we also found that most CD169 + macrophages are positive for viral NP antigens ( Figure 2B) . We therefore reasoned that the CD169 + macrophages play a central role in mediating SARS-CoV-2 translocation in spleens and LNs, and thus contribute to viral growth and spread.",

In addition to antigen persistence stimulation, some proinflammatory cytokines like IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 can also can mediate cellular apoptosis and necrosis. 20, 21 We focused here on IL-6 because it contributes to host defense against to several kinds of pathogen infections. 21, 29 We also reported that the serum concentration of IL-6 is negative to blood CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in COVID-19 patients. 14 Interestingly, exposure to viral Spike protein can trigger Il6 gene transcription in macrophages in vitro, and SARS-CoV-2 infected macrophage also manifested high levels of IL-6 in vivo ( Figure   5 ). 22, 23 We thereby conjecture that macrophages-derived IL-6 would trigger lymphocyte apoptosis and necrosis, while also enhancing Fas expression. Tocilizumab, a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, has been developed and approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 30, 31 Tocilizumab has also been shown to be effective against cytokine release syndrome resulting from CAR-T cell infusion against B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 32 Since Tocilizumab has now been approved for use in clinical therapy for COVID-19 patients, whether tocilizumab can restore spleen and LN functions in COVID-19 patients by suppressing IL-6 signaling is an area requiring further investigation.",
