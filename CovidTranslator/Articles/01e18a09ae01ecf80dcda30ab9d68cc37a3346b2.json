Here we show that this loop, when fused to the constitutively secreted protein \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin (AT), is sufficient to direct the fusion protein to secretory granules. Importantly, the sorting efficiency of the AT reporter protein bearing two loops (E2/3-AT-E2/3) is much higher compared with that of AT with a single disulfide-bonded loop. In contrast to endogenous CgB, E2/3-AT-E2/3 does not undergo Ca 2\u03e9 /pH-dependent aggregation in the TGN. Furthermore, the disulfide-bonded loop of CgB mediates membrane binding in the TGN and does so with 5-fold higher efficiency if two loops are present on the reporter protein. The latter finding supports the concept that under physiological conditions, aggregates of CgB are the sorted units of cargo which have multiple loops on their surface leading to high membrane binding and sorting efficiency of CgB in the TGN.",

Constitutive secretory proteins exit the TGN in CVs which continuously fuse with the plasma membrane (PM) to release their content. Regulated secretory proteins are sorted into ISGs which undergo maturation. During maturation, a subset of proteins is removed from ISGs in a process termed constitutive-like secretion (Arvan and Castle, 1998) .

For chromogranin B (CgB) and secretogranin II (SgII) this aggregation depends on millimolar Ca 2\u03e9 concentrations and on a mildly acidic pH, conditions which are present in the lumen of the TGN. Ca 2\u03e9 /pH-dependent aggregation of proteins is thought to be mediated by a structural feature composed of numerous acidic amino acids distributed over large parts of the polypeptide chain (Gerdes et al., 1989) . Whether other motifs of regulated secretory proteins, comprised by short stretches of amino acids and often referred to as sorting signals, are also involved in sorting at the level of the TGN by a mechanism distinct from aggregation, is poorly understood.",

            "text": "The first indication for the existence of a specific sorting signal functioning at the level of the TGN was obtained for CgB, a regulated secretory protein of the granin family of proteins with widespread distribution in neuroendocrine cells. Near the N-terminus, CgB contains a disulfidebonded loop which is highly conserved across species, and between CgB and chromogranin A (CgA) (Huttner et al., 1995) , another member of the granin family. This loop motif is encoded by a separate exon, exon 3, for both CgB and CgA. Two lines of evidence show that the loop structure is necessary for sorting of CgB to the regulated pathway of protein secretion. First, reductive cleavage of the disulfide bond led to constitutive secretion of CgB (Chanat et al., 1993) but did not interfere with its aggregative properties in the TGN (Chanat et al., 1994) . Secondly, vaccinia-based expression of a loop-deleted form of CgB, i.e. expression of the mutant in the absence of endogenous granin synthesis by infection with a recombinant virus, revealed that the 22 amino acids comprising the loop are necessary for sorting of CgB from the TGN to ISGs (Kroemer et al., 1998) . The finding that the loopdeleted mutant of CgB is sorted to ISGs in the presence but not in the absence of full-length CgB highlighted the function of aggregative processes at the level of the TGN during sorting to the regulated pathway. The disulfide bond in this sequence is indicated by a bracket. The two double arrows indicate the sequence tested in reporter constructs (E2/3, E3). Note that E3 refers to aa 10-12 encoded by the end of exon 2 and to aa 13-43 encoded by exon 3. Numbers indicate position of amino acids in mature rat CgB. (B) Different recombinant proteins tested in this study. The constitutive reporter molecule AT was fused to the C-terminus of full length rat CgB (CgB-AT). E2/3 and E3 were inserted both at the N-terminus of AT (E2/3-AT and E3-AT, respectively). E2/3 was fused to the C-terminus of AT (AT-E2/3). E2/3 or E3 were inserted at the N-and C-terminus of AT (E2/3-AT-E2/3 and E3-AT-E3, respectively).",

First, we characterized the type of vesicle in which E2/ 3-AT-E2/3 left the TGN using a 5 min [ 35 S]sulfate pulse followed by a 12 min chase. At this time point [ 35 S]sulfatelabelled secretory proteins have left the TGN in secretory vesicles. CVs and ISGs were separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described previously (Tooze and Huttner, 1990) . In addition to E2/3-AT-E2/3, AT and E2/3-AT, both with a low S eff ( Figure 3B ), were analysed in parallel. On the equilibrium gradient AT comigrated with heparan sulfate proteoglycan (hsPG), a marker for constitutive vesicles in PC12 cells (CV, Figure 4A ). This result is consistent with the low S eff obtained for AT ( Figure 3B ) and confirms its secretion by the constitutive pathway. As expected from its slightly higher S eff , E2/3-AT largely comigrated with CVs ( Figure 4B ) and only a shoulder was present at the position of ISGs. In contrast, most of E2/3-AT-E2/3 comigrated with endogenous SgII, a marker protein for ISGs, whereas a minor portion comigrated with the marker for CVs, endogenous hsPG ( Figure 4C ). These data clearly show that the majority of E2/3-AT-E2/3 had entered the ISGs, whereas a minor portion exited the TGN in CVs. Determination of the sorting efficiency of E2/3-AT-E2/3 (see Materials and methods) revealed that at the level of the TGN~60% of E2/3-AT-E2/3 is sorted to ISGs. This sorting value is significantly higher than the storage value determined at the level of mature secretory granules after 90 min of chase ( Figure 3B ).",

After 90 min of chase, equal aliquots of cell lysates and media were analysed either directly for SgII or by immuno-precipitation for recombinant proteins, followed by SDS-PAGE and phosphoimaging.

Error bars, standard deviation. granules. We used this approach to analyse whether disulfide bond formation is important for the sorting of E2/3-AT-E2/3. The S eff of E2/3-AT-E2/3 was determined after pulse-chase labelling with [ 35 S]sulfate in the absence and presence of 2 mM DTT. As a control, AT of transfected PC12 cells was analysed in parallel. Figure 7 shows that storage of E2/3-AT-E2/3 dropped significantly from 33.3% \u03ee 3.9 SD in the absence of DTT to 7.0% \u03ee 1.6 SD in the presence of DTT. Importantly, this value is very similar to that obtained for AT (S eff \u03ed 7.9% \u03ee 2.3 SD in the absence of DTT; S eff \u03ed 9.4% \u03ee 0.1 SD in the presence of DTT). This S eff reflects the background level of the constitutive reporter (see also Figure 3 ). In contrast, endogenous SgII with a S eff of 91.7% \u03ee 3.6 SD in the absence of DTT was still stored efficiently in DTT-treated transfected PC12 cells (S eff \u03ed 68.8% \u03ee 2.9 SD, Figure  7 ), as found previously by Chanat et al. (1993) for DTTtreated non-transfected PC12 cells. This indicates that the sorting machinery for the regulated pathway of secretion was still functioning in the presence of DTT. Therefore the lack of storage of E2/3-AT-E2/3 indicates that disulfide bond formation is necessary for sorting of E2/3-AT-E2/3 to the regulated pathway of protein secretion.",

From this it has been proposed that selective aggregation of CgB in the TGN is an important step for its sorting to ISGs (Chanat and Huttner, 1991) . To test whether the disulfide-bonded loop of CgB is involved in Ca 2\u03e9 /pH-mediated aggregation, we analysed in isolated TGN vesicles (Chanat and Huttner, 1991) the aggregative properties of AT bearing two loops. PC12 cells transfected with E2/3-AT-E2/3 were pulse-labelled for 5 min with [ 35 S]sulfate. After subcellular fractionation TGN vesicle preparations were perforated with 0.1% Supernatants and pellets were divided into two equal aliquots.

They were sedimented and supernatants and pellets were analysed for recombinant E2/3-AT-E2/3 and endogenous CgB. Under aggregative conditions 94.9% of full-length CgB and its fragments were obtained in the pellet, whereas under non-aggregative conditions endogenous CgB appeared almost completely in the supernatant and only 4.9% were found in the pellet (Figure 9 ). However, E2/3-AT-E2/3 was only detectable in the supernatant even in the presence of Ca 2\u03e9 /pH 6.4 ( Figure 9 ). Thus, the disulfide-bonded loop does not confer the Ca 2\u03e9 / pH-dependent aggregative properties to the reporter and probably functions independently of Ca 2\u03e9 and mildly acidic pH.",

Similarly, missorting of endogenous CgB in PC12 cells was observed upon DTT treatment (Chanat et al., 1993) .",

This is in agreement with the concept proposed previously (Gerdes et al., 1989 ) that the highly negatively charged region of CgB encoded by exon 4 is the structure responsible for Ca 2\u03e9 /pH-dependent aggregation. The inability of E2/3-AT-E2/3 to form Ca 2\u03e9 /pHdependent aggregates may explain the observation that the sorting efficiency of E2/3-AT-E2/3 to ISGs (S eff~6 0% after 12 min of chase as determined by gradient analysis; Figure 4 ) was significantly higher than the storage efficiency (33% as determined after 90 min of chase; Figure  3B ). This result suggests that constitutive-like secretion may have occurred during maturation of ISGs. This pathway was originally proposed by Arvan and Castle (1992) and is thought to remove secretory proteins which stay soluble during ongoing condensation in the maturation process. If constitutive-like vesicles budded from ISGs, they seem to have fused directly (and not via the endosome) with the PM, because the secretion kinetics of E2/3-AT-E2/3 are rapid and very similar to that of AT (Figure 2 ). The fact that E2/3-AT-E2/3 is only partially removed by constitutive-like secretion may be explained at least in part by the membrane binding of E2/3-AT-E2/3. Whether in addition loop-loop interactions, as observed in vitro (Corti et al., 1997; Thiele and Huttner, 1998) , play a role in retention of E2/3-AT-E2/3 in ISGs remains to be investigated. As an alternative explanation for the difference between the sorting and the storage efficiency of E2/3-AT-E2/3, stimulus-independent exocytosis of secretory granules may have occurred. Fig. 11 . Membrane binding of E2/3-AT-E2/3 after depolarization-induced exocytosis of secretory granules. PC12 cells transfected with E2/3-AT-E2/3 were incubated in non-stimulating media either 5K/Ca medium (A) or 55K/Mg medium (B) or stimulated for exocytosis 55K/Ca medium (C). As a control, cells transfected with AT were stimulated in parallel with 55K/Ca medium (D). Thereafter cells were probed for surface-staining of E2/3-AT-E2/3 or AT with an antiserum against AT and analysed by confocal microscopy. Single sections midway up the cell are shown.

This result is consistent with the concept that both loops of E2/3-AT-E2/3 bind directly and synergistically to the membrane resulting in more membrane-bound E2/3-AT-E2/3 than E2/3-AT. Alternatively, the higher signal of E2/3-AT-E2/ 3 in the membrane pellet might not result from single molecules of E2/3-AT-E2/3 that are directly bound to the membrane but from chains of E2/3-AT-E2/3 molecules, with one or both ends attached to the membrane in the TGN. E2/3-AT-E2/3 chains may have formed by looploop interactions which are known to promote dimerization of CgA in vitro (Thiele and Huttner, 1998) . However, we did not detect oligomeric forms of E2/3-AT-E2/3 by sedimentation of cell lysates on sucrose gradients (not shown). If chains existed in vivo (high concentration of E2/3-AT-E2/3 at pH 6.4) they presumably would be unstable under our experimental conditions (high protein dilution at pH 7.3). Thus, our membrane binding assay most likely detects E2/3-AT-E2/3 molecules directly bound to components of the membrane. In addition to membrane binding in the TGN, membrane-bound E2/3-AT-E2/3 was detected at the PM after exocytosis of SGs.",

Two lines of evidence argue against CPE as the binding partner for the disulfidebonded loop of CgB in the TGN. First, in Neuro2A cells expressing CPE-antisense RNA, CgA with a disulfidebonded loop highly homologous to that of CgB was not missorted to constitutive vesicles, whereas proinsulin and proenkephalin exhibited an increased basal release (Normant and Loh, 1998) . Secondly, despite the absence of CPE in exocrine tissue, CgB expressed in transgenic mice is sorted into amylase containing exocrine granules (Natori et al., 1998) .

First, it is conceivable that the percentage of membrane-bound E2/3-AT-E2/3 in living cells is higher than detected in our assay. Directly membrane-bound E2/ 3-AT-E2/3 may have been lost due to the mechanical stress during the isolation procedure. In addition, a loss of membrane-linked E2/3-AT-E2/3 chains may have occurred upon dilution due to a similarly modest homodimerization affinity as obtained for full-length CgA (K D \u03ed 1.6 \u00b5M) or CgA 1-60 (K D \u03ed 85 nM). Secondly, a contribution to the high sorting value of E2/3-AT-E2/3 may result from the direct interaction of E2/3-AT-E2/3 to loops of CgB aggregates and not to the membrane. However, binding to endogenous cargo is not supported by our data, showing that E2/3-AT-E2/3 did not sediment together with aggregates of CgB in vitro. We therefore favour the explanation that the different extents of sorting and membrane binding of E2/3-AT-E2/3 as determined in our assays is due to a loss of the membrane-bound fusion protein during the analysis.",

            "text": "Our results demonstrate that sorting to ISGs of AT bearing two loops is much more efficient than AT with only one loop. How can this be explained? Several lines of evidence indicate that the Ca 2\u03e9 /pH-mediated aggregation is an essential step in chromogranin sorting to the regulated pathway of secretion (Huttner et al., 1995) . Protein aggregates have been detected in the TGN by electron microscopy (Tooze et al., 1987) . Furthermore, aggregates of CgB and SgII were found biochemically in perforated TGN vesicle preparations (Chanat and Huttner, 1991) . The importance of aggregate formation for sorting of regulated secretory proteins was demonstrated by preventing aggregation upon neutralization of the pH in the TGN with NH 4 Cl in vivo (Gerdes et al., 1989) and by missorting loopless CgB in the absence of endogenous granins (Kroemer et al., 1998) . Therefore, under physiological conditions most likely not single molecules but aggregates of regulated secretory proteins exit the TGN into ISGs. Our working hypothesis is that aggregates represent the sorting units and have exposed many sorting signals at their surface. According to this model we suggest that, in addition to segregation of regulated from constitutive secretory proteins and concentration of the former, aggregation in the TGN has a third function which is multimerization of sorting signals for the regulated pathway of protein secretion. To generate a sorting unit carrying multiple sorting signals with a nonaggregative reporter, we expressed AT with two disulfidebonded loops. The finding that this recombinant protein was sorted and stored much more efficiently than AT bearing only one loop is in agreement with our model that multiple signals are necessary for efficient sorting to ISGs (Figure 12) . Furthermore, the finding that E3-AT-E3 and E2/3-AT-E2/3 were stored with nearly the maximal efficiency possible in our reporter system, suggests that two sorting signals on a reporter suffice to mimic sorting of an aggregate (Figure 12 ). Evidence in favour of such a model is provided by the higher binding efficiency to TGN membranes of E2/3-AT-E2/3 as compared with E2/3-AT.",

Rat CgB cDNA (Forss-Petter et al., 1989) was used in PCRs as a template to generate cDNA fragments encoding amino acid sequences with the disulfide-bonded loop. The loop-encoding sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. The different fragments (E2/3, E3; Figure 1 ) were inserted either at the 5\u0408-or 3\u0408-end of the AT cDNA. All insertions into the 5\u0408 end were cloned using the unique BamHI restriction site.

(A) Fusion proteins consisting of AT and the disulfide-bonded loop do not undergo Ca 2\u03e9 /pH-mediated aggregation in the TGN. Single molecules are the sorting units. Efficient loop-mediated membrane-binding in the TGN occurs only when more than one loop is fused to AT. (B) CgB undergoes Ca 2\u03e9 / pH-mediated aggregation in the TGN.The formed CgB aggregates are the sorting units to ISGs which have exposed multiple loops at their surface. More than one loop interacts with the membrane in the TGN leading to high binding efficiency.",
