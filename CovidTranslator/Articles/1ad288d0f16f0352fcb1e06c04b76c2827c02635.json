In vivo immuno-histochemical studies of the liver from infected mice have demonstrated that mechanisms other than direct viral injury are in operation. To examine potential mechanisms, the interaction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Kupffer cells with MHV 3 was studied. We first observed a dramatic inhibition in viral replication in LPS-treated Kupffer cells explanted from A/J resistant mice. Second, we demonstrated that MHV 3 induced a dose-dependent interleukin 1 (IL-1) activity in the supernatants of infected Kupffer cells of both strains. These results led us finally to examine the antigenprocessing function of the Kupffer cells of both strains of mice. No striking differences were observed in the ability of Kupffer ceils from resistant or sensitive mice to collaborate with immuno-competent lymphocytes. Our data suggest that Kupffer cells play a double role which is crucial in the pathogenesis of MHV 3-induced hepatitis. First, they act directly as the genetically determined sensitivity of mice to MHV 3 infection is correlated with the efficiency of the antiviral activity induced in Kupffer cells by LPS. Second, they act indirectly through the synthesis of different amounts of IL-1 induced by MHV 3. This hypothesis is further borne out by the effects of indomethacin treatment on the course of MHV 3 infection in A/J resistant mice in vivo.",

An investigation was thus made concerning the induction of IL-1 synthesis in Kupffer cells infected with MHV 3. Fig. 3A shows that MHV 3 induces the synthesis of IL-1 in Kupffer cells. Accordingly, supernatant fluids derived from normal non-activated Balb/c Kupffer cells, whether infected or not with MHV 3, did not contain any detectable amounts of IL-1 activity as measured by the standard mouse thymocyte proliferation assay. However, pretreatment of Kupffer cells with indomethacin shows them to display a virus dose-dependent increase in IL-1 synthesis. Finally, treatment of Kupffer cells with endotoxin in the presence of indomethacin still further increases the amount of IL-1 activity detected in the supernatants of infected Kupffer cells. Pretreatment of Kupffer cells with LPS in the absence of indomethacin led to variable results concerning the amount of detectable IL-1 activity but this effect was regularly virus dose dependent. Similar results were observed with Kupffer cells from A/J mice who also responded with a virus dose-dependent increase in IL-1 synthesis after treatment with indomethacin (Fig. 3B ). MHV 3 induces an IL-1 activity detectable in the supernatant of Kupffer cells pretreated with indomethacin. Indomethacin is known to block the synthesis of prostaglandin E 2 which acts as an inhibitor of IL-1. Given the crucial role of the Kupffer ceils in the resistance of the A/J mice to MHV 3, it was of interest to check the effect of indomethacin treatment on the course of MHV 3 infection in A/J mice (Table 1) . Indomethacin alone had no deleterious effects on control animals when used at the dosages mentioned above. Animals infected with 2 \u2022 103 pfu of MHV 3 were fully resistant to the virus and showed no mortality. 92% of the animals that were treated with indomethacin and infected with MHV 3 died within 8 days of infection.",

Although such high doses of LPS are never reached in vivo it must be kept in mind that, in the organism, other mediators such as interferon (released during the primary stages of viral infection) may decrease the threshold of sensitivity to LPS in the Kupffer cells.

However, infection with MHV 3 does not impair the ability of the Kupffer cells to synthesize IL-1. More surprisingly, our data demonstrate that MHV 3 stimulates IL-1 production by Kupffer cells in vitro. Although viruses have long been considered to be effective inducers of IL-1, the data regarding virus-induced IL-1 production have been almost entirely derived from early animal studies [16] . To our knowledge, the only report of the ability of viruses to stimulate IL-1 production in vitro comes from Roberts et al. [17] 93 who demonstrated the capacity of influenza virus to stimulate human IL-1 production in human macrophages. The finding that MHV 3 induces the synthesis of IL-1 in a dose-dependent manner is intriguing. IL-1 in the surrounding tissues is known to contribute to acute pathological changes such as cellular infiltration and hyperemia [16, 18] . Recently, it has been shown to act directly and selectively on cultured vascular endothelial cells [18, 19] : first, IL-1 induced endothelial biosynthesis and surface expression of a tissue factor-like procoagulant activity; second, IL-1 dramatically increases the adhesiveness of the endothelial cell surface for peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes.",

We report that indomethacin treatment alters the innate resistance of A/J mice. Results recently published by Abecassis et al. [20] have demonstrated that prostaglandin E 2 prevents fulminant hepatitis in susceptible Balb/c mice. Since indomethacin is known to block the synthesis of prostaglandin E 2, which is an inhibitor of IL-1 activity, these data further bear out the role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of MHV 3 infection of mice. Thus, resistance to an acute infection appears to depend to a large extent on the replication potential of MHV 3 in cells of the reticuloendothelial system. Le Prevost et al. [21] [22] [23] have shown that various manipulations affecting the host defence system may drastically enhance the susceptibility of genetically resistant mice. When the cellular or the humoral immune system is crippled by such non-selective methods as whole body irradiation or treatment with anitilymphocyte serum, resistance can be abrogated. Under these conditions mice die with specific lesions of the liver and high virus titers. It is known that X-irradiation causes a lymphoid depletion but also an impairment of the macrophage immunogenic function. It does not suppress the antigen uptake by macrophages but interferes with the processing stage. However, our results do in fact demonstrate that in genetically susceptible mice the Kupffer cells are perfectly able to process the MHV 3-Ag in a way which efficiently triggers off splenic lymphocyte proliferation. These data emphasize the role of the resistance of Kupffer cells to MHV 3 replication: a delayed viral replication in A/J resistant mice opens the way for the induction of the immune response to take place.",

Treatment of Balb/c Kupffer cells with LPS failed to induce any noticeable restriction in the virus growth. The multiplication of MHV 3 in Kupffer cells isolated from A/J resistant mice is shown in Fig. lB. In nonactivated Kupffer cells from A/J mice, although the final yield of virus is the same as that found in Kupffer cells from Balb/c mice, there is a delay of 24-36 h in the onset of viral growth. In addition, activation of the A/J Kupffer cells with LPS lengthened the lag phase of viral growth and decreased the final virus yield.",
