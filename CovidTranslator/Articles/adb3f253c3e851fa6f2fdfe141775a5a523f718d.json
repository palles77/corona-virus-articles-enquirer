Acutely ill and injured patients seeking evaluation and treatment in the emergency department (ED) not only have the potential to spread communicable infectious diseases to healthcare personnel and other patients, but are vulnerable to acquiring new infections associated with the care they receive. This article will evaluate these risks and review the existing literature for infection prevention practices in the ED, ranging from hand hygiene, standard and transmission-based precautions, healthcare personnel vaccination, and environmental controls to strategies for preventing healthcare-associated infections. We will conclude by examining what can be done to optimize infection prevention in the ED and identify gaps in knowledge where further research is needed. Successful implementation of evidence-based practices coupled with innovation of novel approaches and technologies tailored specifically to the complex and dynamic environment of the ED are the keys to raising the standard for infection prevention and patient safety in emergency care.",

            "text": "Infection prevention is a major challenge in the rapid-paced, high-volume setting of emergency care. The emergency department (ED) is a complex and dynamic healthcare environment. Patients present with undifferentiated illnesses and variable acuity, ranging from the otherwise healthy to the critically ill. Risk recognition and medical decisionmaking are often based on limited and evolving data, under significant time and resource constraints. Patients await diagnosis, intervention, and disposition in close proximity of one another. With more than 129.8 million patient visits made to U.S. EDs in 2010 alone, the ED is a busy place subject to rapid patient turnover and even overcrowding. 1 The ED is a major gateway to inpatient medical care, contributing nearly half of all hospital admissions. 2 It also constitutes our healthcare system's frontline in the response to public health emergencies and disasters. Amidst these diverse roles and competing demands, infection prevention can easily be overlooked or superseded by other immediate and life-threatening issues. Yet, significant infectious disease risks exist in emergency care that can carry substantial clinical consequences for both patients and healthcare personnel (HCP). This article will address infection prevention in the ED through two central themes: 1) preventing the transmission of infectious diseases from ill patients to HCP and to other patients, and 2) reducing the risk of infection associated with receiving emergency care. We will review the existing literature behind ED hand hygiene, standard and transmission-based isolation precautions, HCP vaccination, and environmental controls. Next, we will examine the threat of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) related to central venous catheters, urinary catheters, mechanical ventilation, and other medical devices commonly used in the ED. We will conclude by identifying areas in which we can improve infection prevention in the ED today, as well as highlight gaps in knowledge that would benefit from further investigation as we look to the future.",

            "text": "Ignaz Semmelweis first recognized the fundamental role of hand hygiene in curbing the spread of contagion more than a century and half ago while working in the obstetrics wards of Vienna General Hospital. At a time when puerperal fever was common and often fatal, Semmelweis demonstrated that physician hand disinfection with a chlorinated lime solution could lead to a significant decline in the incidence and mortality of this disease. To this day, hand hygiene remains the cornerstone of modern infection prevention and is the single most important strategy for curbing transmission of infectious microorganisms between patients, HCP, and the healthcare environment. 3 While normal human skin is routinely colonized with resident bacterial flora (e.g., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus), transient flora can contaminate the skin of HCP through direct patient contact or contact with the patient's immediate environment. 3, 4 Transient flora can include Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, Gram-negative bacilli, and C. difficile, all of which have been associated with HAIs, as well as a host of respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses. When performed regularly and correctly, hand hygiene eliminates transient flora, thereby disrupting transmission of these microorganisms. 3 Alcohol-based gel and foam products are superior to regular and antimicrobial soap in reducing bacterial counts, and are therefore recommended for most routine hand hygiene. They also incur less of a time burden than soap and water, which may improve adherence to their use. 5, 6 Hospital-wide hand hygiene programs employing alcohol-based hand rubs have been credited with dramatic reductions in HAIs. 7, 8 However, scrubbing and rinsing with soap and water is still preferred when caring for patients with C. difficile infection, as alcohol-based products are not effective against C. difficile spores, or when there is visible soiling of the hands. Hand hygiene should be performed anytime HCP enter the 3-foot space around a patient, as the immediate environment and equipment surrounding the patient can be readily contaminated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) provide valuable guidance on effective hand hygiene practices. 3, 9 Hand hygiene adherence has been shown to be lower in settings with high patient activity, such as the intensive care unit (ICU), and among physicians. 10 Early studies of ED hand hygiene echo these trends. [11] [12] [13] [14] More recently, ED hand hygiene adherence rates have ranged anywhere from 10% to 90%. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Variable adherence with hand hygiene in the ED has been attributed to lack of time, urgent clinical situations, and high patient workload. Lower hand hygiene adherence has also been associated with caring for patients in ED hallways, a marker for high ED visit volume and a surrogate for overcrowding. 18 Much of the existing literature on hand hygiene implementation is comprised of quasiexperimental studies. Interventions addressing ED hand hygiene practices have been met with differing success (Table 1) . At the level of the individual provider, interventions have ranged from posting high visibility signs promoting hand hygiene and circulating educational materials to staff to trialing touch-free as well as personal wearable hand sanitizer dispensers. 14, 20, 21 Workflow optimization and standardization have also been examined as a means of streamlining bedside procedures and reducing extraneous hand hygiene events in the course of patient care. 22 Larger, multifaceted interventions incorporating group and one-on-one education, a shared culture of patient safety, designated clinician champions to promote and model proper hand hygiene, improved access to alcohol-based hand rub, and routine hand hygiene monitoring through direct observation have led to sustained improvements in ED hand hygiene adherence. 23-25 Immediate feedback about hand hygiene performance as well as regular reporting and dissemination of HCP adherence rates foster accountability and provide concrete benchmarks by which improvement can be measured. These studies align with a general consensus based on existing evidence that bundled interventions incorporating education, reminders, feedback, administrative support, and access to alcohol-based hand rub are our most effective means for improving hand hygiene adherence. 26, 27 Standard precautions ED HCP routinely come in contact with blood and other potentially infectious body fluids (e.g., cerebrospinal, pleural, peritoneal, pericardial, synovial, amniotic) during patient care. 28, 29 Up to two-thirds of procedures performed in the ED result in some form of HCP exposure to blood or other body fluid. 30 Most exposures involve the hands. Exposures to the face are more likely to occur during tube thoracostomy, lumbar puncture, or examination of a hemorrhaging patient.",

            "text": "First introduced by the CDC in the 1980s due to the growing epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, standard precautions mandate the use of barriers (e.g., gloves, protective gowns, masks, and eye wear) to protect HCP from bloodborne pathogens such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, 31-33 as well as to prevent transmission of other infectious microorganisms. They are indicated when contact with blood or other body fluids, mucous membranes, non-intact skin, or potentially infectious material is anticipated. Face and eye protection are recommended for procedures and examinations where splashes or sprays of blood or other body fluids are likely. Eye wear must consist of a face shield, goggles, or glasses with side shields in order to be considered protective. Standard precautions also encompass hand and respiratory hygiene as well as the safe handling of potentially contaminated equipment and environmental surfaces. 34 Previously referred to as universal precautions, standard precautions are one of the most extensively studied infection prevention strategies in emergency care. Despite CDC guidelines and a mandate from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) since 1991, 35 the day-to-day practice of standard precautions and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the ED remains highly variable. Several studies performed in U.S. academic medical centers have employed either direct observation or video recording during trauma and medical resuscitations to measure adherence, 36-42 and have reported rates ranging from 38% to 89%. In some cases, HCP adherence to standard precautions improved if a patient was visibly bleeding. 39, 43 Yet, other studies have demonstrated the opposite, underscoring how clinical urgency can compete with infection prevention practices in acute situations. 37, 40, 44 During resuscitations, ED HCP are more likely to wear gloves than a gown, mask, or protective eye wear. The same holds true during non-emergent clinical encounters, despite the potential for exposure to blood and other body fluids. 12, 43, 45, 46 In surveys of ED HCP, commonly cited barriers to adherence to standard precautions have included lack of time, a perception that a patient is at low risk for being infected with HIV or another bloodborne pathogen, interference with dexterity and technical skills, and poor access to PPE at the bedside. 47-51 In some cases, HCP also report uncertainty of which protective barriers to use and when, reflecting inadequate training or knowledge retention. 52, 53 Several intervention studies have sought to improve HCP adherence to standard precautions in the ED (Table 2) . 44, 54-58 Educational programs have employed in-service lectures, smallgroup discussions, and written materials highlighting the risks posed by bloodborne pathogens. 54, 56-58 One study also incorporated group review of a resuscitation video recording showing poor adherence to standard precautions. 58 Visual cues at the patient bedside in the form of posters along with verbal reminders from supervising staff have helped to reinforce adherence. 44, 56, 58 Bundling of supplies in designated supply carts or pre-organized packs provides immediate access to PPE and facilitates their use in resuscitation settings. 44, 57 Adherence monitoring through \"environmental safety\" rounds 55 or less formal means 57 accompanied by the threat of disciplinary action with repeated lapses in adherence has likewise been shown to be effective. Although not studied as an intervention, pre-notification and assembly of the trauma team in the resuscitation area prior to the arrival of a patient has also been associated with improved adherence to standard precautions. 38",

Varicella (including disseminated zoster), highly pathogenic influenza, and smallpox may also be transmitted in this manner. Rapid identification and isolation of ED patients suspected of harboring an airborne disease hinges greatly upon heightened clinical suspicion, as in the case of tuberculosis. 71 Screening tools and clinical decision-making instruments can help inform this process. 72, 73 Proper HCP protection against airborne droplet nuclei requires use of either an N95 or powered air purifying respirator. 62 In a survey of emergency medicine residents, selfreported adherence with respirator use during encounters with patients at risk for tuberculosis was low due to poor availability of masks and lack of appropriate fit testing. 74 Likewise, during the SARS epidemic, many HCP infections were associated with inadequate use of PPE including respirators. 75, 76 Engineering controls aimed at mitigating or eliminating workplace hazards factor prominently in preventing airborne transmission of pathogens in the ED. 62 Singleoccupancy airborne infection isolation rooms equipped with special air handling and ventilation systems (capable of \u226512 air changes per hour) to generate negative room pressure have been associated with significant reductions in tuberculosis conversion rates among urban ED HCP caring for high-risk populations. 77 Yet, the availability of such isolation facilities varies among EDs. 78 Increased respirator availability, education, and fit testing combined with the construction, certification, and regular maintenance of airborne infection isolation rooms are necessary measures to assure the adequacy of ED airborne precautions.",

While a single occupancy patient room is preferred, spatial distancing (\u22643 feet) and separation of patient beds by curtains are also acceptable methods of droplet isolation. Patient cohorting during outbreaks and peak respiratory virus season has also been shown feasible in the ED in order to limit transmission and increase surge capacity. 81 When surveyed about patients presenting with influenza-like illness, emergency physicians and nurses report less than optimal adherence with surgical mask or glove use. 82 As with airborne precautions, limited training and availability of respiratory PPE may be partly to blame. Lack of reminders about droplet precautions may also contribute. To this end, the electronic health record (EHR) can be a useful tool for improving ED HCP adherence. Electronic notification of physicians and nurses about the need for droplet precautions when placing an order for influenza testing in the EHR can effect modest improvements in adherence. 83 Some of the challenges with HCP adherence to airborne and droplet precautions may also tie into how respiratory PPE impacts the therapeutic interaction between HCP and patients. 84 Respirators and surgical masks form a highly visible physical barrier between the two that may not only interfere with clear communication but promote social distancing and isolation, further compounded when physical isolation of the patient is necessary. How much this actually influences HCP adherence to airborne and droplet precautions has not been well-studied.",

Transmission of these pathogens and others, including SARS and highly pathogenic influenza, can occur through direct contact with patients or their immediate surroundings. Contact precautions entail the use of protective gowns and gloves during patient care to prevent HCP acquisition and transmission of these pathogens to other patients. 62 With the exception of patients presenting with diarrhea or bowel incontinence, the decision to initiate contact precautions in the ED can be difficult. Policies guiding their use vary widely among EDs. 96 Many hospital EHRs now automatically flag established patients with a past history of MDRO infection or colonization, 97, 98 allowing ED HCP to identify these patients and initiate contact precautions early on in their care. Others have implemented selective screening for MDROs and empiric use of contact precautions for any patient coming from a nursing home or long-term care facility. 99 The extent of HCP adherence to contact precautions once the need has been identified is not yet known.",

            "text": "Historically, ED CLABSI studies have focused on aseptic technique during CVC insertion. Video-based assessments have reported HCP adherence ranging from 33% to 88%, with lower rates among senior physicians. 132, 133 Simulation-based training improves adherence to aseptic technique and has been associated with a reduction in CLABSI rates. 134 Successful strategies to prevent CLABSI in the ICU revolve around comprehensive bundles incorporating education, hand hygiene, use of maximal sterile barrier precautions (surgical gown, sterile gloves, mask, cap, and large sheet drape), chlorhexidine-alcohol skin antisepsis, and avoidance of the femoral vein due to the high infection rate associated with CVC insertion at this site. 135, 136 Standardized CVC kits and equipment carts provide easy access to supplies needed to conform to these practices. Universal CVC insertion checklists provide cues for each of the components and facilitate documentation of adherence to CLABSI prevention measures during the procedure. An observer is designated to review the checklist, monitor aseptic technique, and terminate the procedure should a protocol violation occur. Such systems-based prevention strategies have significantly reduced CLABSI rates in ICUs. 137, 138 Among EDs that have adopted this approach to CVC insertion, successful bundle implementation has been tied to recruitment of clinician champions, staff engagement, clear staff responsibilities, workflow redesign, observer empowerment, and feedback through adherence and CLABSI surveillance data. 139 As of yet, there are no published data on the effects of the checklist and bundle approach on ED CLABSI rates. Formal surveillance of CVCs placed in the ED remains a challenge. The impact of early discontinuation of ED CVCs once they are no longer needed on ED CLABSI rates has not been evaluated. 126 Peripheral venous catheters (PVC) are a mainstay of medical therapy in the ED. While PVC infections are uncommon, bloodstream infection 140, 141 and even septic thrombophlebitis may occur in rare instances. At one academic institution, the estimated incidence of PVCrelated S. aureus bacteremia was 0.07 per 1,000 PVC-days, with more than half of all infected PVCs originating in the ED. 141 Overall adherence to aseptic technique during PVC insertion and line care during infusions have been shown to be poor in the ED. 142 Educational programs paired with direct observation during insertions and feedback on performance can improve adherence and reduce infections associated with PVCs. 142 Avoidance of unnecessary ED PVCs may also reduce infection rates although this has not been formally studied. For patients with difficult vascular access, ultrasound-guided PVCs have emerged as an alternative to CVCs in non-critically ill patients. 143 With proper aseptic technique, infection rates associated with ultrasound-guided PVCs do not differ significantly from that of traditional PVCs. 144",

Another study also reported significant reductions in catheter utilization after guidelines were established for catheter insertion and reinforced by an educational program consisting of lectures and distribution of pocket cards listing appropriate indications. 154 Efforts to reduce catheter utilization among resident physicians using an educational intervention have been less successful. 155 Other efforts have sought to improve procedural knowledge and technique among ED nurses and other staff directly involved in catheter insertion. 156 Outside the ED, multidisciplinary strategies promoting guidelines for appropriate indications for ED catheter placement, a nurse-driven protocol for early catheter removal, and routine monitoring of inpatient urinary catheter prevalence rates have led to sustained hospital-wide reductions in catheter use 157 that have been replicated on a population scale. 158",

Defined as pneumonia acquired in the hospital after more than 48 hours of mechanical ventilation that was not present at the time of intubation, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) carries significant morbidity and variable mortality. 159, 160 Several studies have shown that trauma patients requiring intubation in the ED or prehospital setting may be predisposed to VAP for a variety of reasons, ranging from injury severity, hemodynamic instability, and depressed mental status to suboptimal intubation conditions resulting in aspiration. [161] [162] [163] [164] [165] Increased ED length of stay has also been identified as an independent risk factor for pneumonia in emergently intubated trauma patients. 166 With at least half of all cases of VAP considered preventable, 145 several guidelines exist outlining simple and low-cost strategies to minimize aspiration of secretions, reduce colonization of the patient's respiratory tract with pathogenic bacteria, and prevent contamination of mechanical ventilation equipment. 167, 168 Studies have demonstrated that multifaceted interventions based on these guidelines may be associated with reductions in VAP rates, 169, 170 although controversy still exists. Nursing interventions including routine suctioning above the endotracheal cuff, elevating the head of the bed at least 30 degrees, and providing oral hygiene with 1.5% hydrogen peroxide solution can be readily implemented in the ED with appropriate education, testing, and adherence monitoring. 171 Limiting the duration of mechanical ventilation in carefully selected ED patients through early extubation has been shown to be safe, 172 although the impact of this on VAP rates has not yet been studied.",

While essential to increasing HCP knowledge about established infection prevention practices, education alone does not maintain high levels of adherence. Policies and guidelines will not have an impact unless they are observed. 177 Obstacles to ED infection prevention need to be understood, addressed, and overcome. Readily accessible PPE, alcohol-based hand rub dispensers, and other critical infection prevention supplies increase the likelihood that HCP will routinely use them in the course of patient care. Frequent reminders and feedback reinforce education and prompt HCP to perform key infection prevention practices at the bedside where competing clinical demands are high. Open communication among HCP about breaches in these practices foster accountability, trust, and a team mentality. Checklists and bundles ease our dependence on memory alone to complete complex tasks and promote high reliability care. Formal adherence monitoring and HAI surveillance provide concrete metrics by which performance improvement can be measured and relayed back to HCP. Finally, commitment and support from ED clinical and administrative leaders seal the foundation for a shared culture of safety. In this environment, ED infection prevention becomes both an organizational as well as an individual responsibility. While fewer studies have targeted infection prevention practices in the ED than in other healthcare settings, there is evidence that this comprehensive, multifaceted approach can be successful.",

As many hospitals transition to electronic documentation and computerized provider order entry, the EHR can serve as a powerful tool for implementing infection prevention strategies. Adherence to transmission-based precautions can be enhanced through automated HCP notifications and alerts. 83 Bundled interventions to prevent CLABSI, CAUTI, and VAP can be directed through standardized electronic order sets. Innovations in automated technology to track the performance of hand hygiene and other infection prevention practices could soon replace the need for time-consuming direct observations, making it easier to measure adherence throughout the ED. Involvement of ED HCP and infection prevention specialists in the planning and design of future EDs can also greatly enhance the feasibility of many basic practices and ensure that sufficient engineering controls are incorporated (e.g., single patient rooms, airborne infection isolation rooms). 178 Optimization of the built environment may not only minimize environmental contamination but facilitate cleaning and disinfection of hospital surfaces in the ED.",

Advances in molecular diagnostics are revolutionizing the way we screen for and diagnose infectious diseases.

Such technology could also be applied to targeted surveillance of high-risk populations for colonization with MDROs (e.g., patients awaiting admission to the ICU or transferred from another healthcare facility or a nursing home). In hospitals with a high prevalence of MDROs, the ED could play a role in active surveillance, although the costs, benefits, and implications of ED-based surveillance have yet to be studied. Admitted patients needing contact isolation often wait longer in the ED until a suitable hospital room is available, 180 which can contribute to overcrowding and even enhanced MDRO transmission if infection prevention practices are not well-adhered to. Strategies such as cohorting patients with MDROs or expediting their admission to an inpatient bed need to be explored.

The impact of new technologies, such as antibiotic impregnated catheters, require validation in chaotic and time-sensitive settings such as the ED.
