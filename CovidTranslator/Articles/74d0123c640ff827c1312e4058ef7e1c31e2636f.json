            "text": "Virtually every diagnostic and researchoriented test in virology begins with an antigen that has been specially prepared for that test. For some tests, the antigen can simply be the supernatant fluid from the cell culture the virus was propagated in, with no regard to the maintenance medium used in culture or the storage conditions for the final product. For others, intact virus is required at the highest titers achievable, so that several freeze-thaw or sonication cycles are applied to the virus culture at complete (4 +) CPE to thoroughly disrupt all remaining cells containing virus; or, a particular viral product needs to be enriched in proportion to other products, but not purified in the biochemical sense. For still others, only a specific viral protein can be used in the test, so that it has to be purified, concentrated, and preserved while all other interfering viral products and medium components are removed. The procedures described in this chapter will accomplish all of these tasks.",

Wherever possible, laboratories should be equipped with recirculating laminar-flow safety cabinets; all operations likely to produce aerosols of infectious materials should be carried out in the cabinet. Minimum requirements for protective clothing include a lab coat or gown and, for more hazardous operations, gloves and masks. During operations involving infectious materials, the workbench would be covered Virology Methods Manual ISBN 0-12-465330-8 with disposable plastic-lined table soakers to prevent contamination. All work areas should be decontaminated with 0.5% hypochlorite solution. All discarded materials must be placed in discard pans and sterilised by standard procedures. One product should be worked with at a time in a very clean environment. All virus products should be certified to be free of viable bacterial, fungal, and mycoplasmal contamination by appropriate culturing in thioglycollate broth, trypticase soy broth, 5% sheep blood agar pour/streak plates, Sabouraud dextrose slants for yeasts, and mycoplasma biphasic medium. While these concepts may seem basic, many a lengthy piece of work has been erroneously interpreted or had to be discarded because the starting culture was contaminated and the test results were obfuscated by the contaminant.",

For some viruses (e.g. herpes viruses) the majority of antigens may remain intracellularly bound and a centrifugation step is necessary in order to remove infected cells from the supernatant. Low speed centrifugation is used to pellet the cells which are washed in PBS before resuspending in an appropriate volume of buffer. The cells/medium/virus mixture is then sonicated at sufficient energy to disrupt all the cells and release the virus, or with additional energy to disrupt the virions to release particular antigens. The energy level must be determined by pilot trials for the test procedure in use. Usually, 30-70 watts for 1-3 min with multiple pulses per minute will break the cells. For labile viruses such as CMV and RSV, a 60second sonication at 60 watts output is sufficient to produce an enhanced antigen. Note: The manufacturer's instructions for the sonicator must be followed carefully, and all sonication steps must be done in an ice bath and in vessels which will not shatter. It is absolutely essential that the antigen does not become heated.",

Viruses which agglutinate red blood cells can be partially purified by adsorbing them to the appropriate erythrocytes at low temperatures, thoroughly washing the cells to remove all non-virion and non-HA antigen components, and then eluting the virus into a simple buffer at higher temperatures. The method has been used effectively for partial purification of intact, infectious influenza, parainfluenza, mumps, measles, and coronaviruses, for removing hemagglutinins from CF antigens, and for obtaining reagents enriched in hemagglutinins (Chappell et al 1984; Hierholzer and Dowdle 1970; Hierholzer et al 1972; Schmidt and Emmons 1989) . Because of the number of washes the cells must undergo, the success of the procedure depends on being able to use one of the 'tougher' species of erythrocytes, such as human, monkey, or chicken, rather than rat, mouse, or guinea pig red blood cells which tend to disintegrate from the physical trauma incurred by the procedure.

Antigens are separated by the process of selective retention, when a 'mobile' phase (liquid) moves through a liquid or solid 'stationary' phase, the retention being based on the size and chemical or immunological attributes of the individual antigens. Gel filtration separates molecules according to their size and the choice of pore size selected in the stationery gel. Small molecules enter the pores and are retained, whereas larger molecules elute through the gel very quickly thus giving rise to a differential elution of antigens, collected in small volume fractions from the gel column. Ion exchange chromatography utilizes the intrinsic ionic charge of a molecule as the differentiating property, in this case the stationary phase of a column contains groups of chemicals with various anionic or cationic charges, these retaining ions from the mobile phase of virus antigens as they pass through the column. Ions that react strongly with the exchange are retained and eluted much later than those with weaker attachment kinetics. Elution is achieved by slowly increasing, with time, the salt concentration of the eluting buffer. More recently this technique has been refined by the introduction of highperformance liquid chromatography (Chicz and Regnier 1990) . For the purpose of antigen separation in this chapter we have chosen to describe, in detail, the method of affinity chromatography, using a monoclonal antibody as the ligand which is immobilized onto the stationary matrix.",

Purification of single virus proteins of 1000-10,000 fold are common practice with such procedures.

            "text": "The advent of advanced techniques in molecular biology and biotechnology has lent itself to the production of more refined systems for both the in vitro expression and purification of viral antigens. These may comprise several amino acids or a larger sequence complete with the post-translational modifications of the authentic protein. The nature of the desired end-product determines the system of choice (i.e. prokaryotic or eukaryotic). Whilst prokaryotic systems are convenient, with the availability of inexpensive scale-up reagents, there are distinct disadvantages in their use for protein expression. This is due to differences in processing pathways which lead to the absence of both amino terminal modifications and di-sulphide bond formation, a lack of glycosylation, and an inability to facilitate the proteolytic cleavage of signal sequence from mature polypeptide chains. In addition, because vertebrate viruses replicate in cells of eukaryotic origin, in some instances it is more feasible to produce the relevant antigen in one of the many eukaryotic systems available where any post-translational modifications can be ensured. Ultimately, the choice of the expression system will be dependent on the role the antigen is to play. Thus it may be required for either diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Diagnostic tests often involve the detection of anti-viral antibodies in body fluids such as serum, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid or synovial fluid which indicate prior exposure to an agent. The diagnostic tests which are used extensively include the ELISA, Western blotting, radioimmunoprecipitation, indirect immunofluorescence, single radial haemolysis-in-gel, and radio-immunoassay. For each of these systems, a different form of the antigen may be required. For therapeutic purposes, the antigen may be required as a subunit vaccine and extensive purification steps may have to be carried out before the antigen can be of use.",

            "text": "The prototype baculovirus Autographa california nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV)is commonly used for the production of recombinant baculoviruses which are engineered for high-level protein expression. The production of the recombinant first involves the cloning of the gene into one of the many baculovirus E x p r e s s i o n of a n t i g e n s in vitro expression vectors available. The most commonly used vectors employ one of two very late baculovirus gene promoters, although studies have been carried out to stably transfect insect cells with plasmids containing genes under the control of one of the immediate early promoters (Jarvis 1991) . The former include the polyhedrin or the p l0 promoters. The polyhedrin gene encodes the polyhedrin protein which surrounds newly synthesized virus particles in the nucleus of the cell. The p l0 promoter is thought to be involved in the assembly of occlusion bodies. Such promoters are flanked by sequences which allow recombination into the baculovirus genome to occur, and unique restriction endonuclease sites are incorporated downstream of them for the insertion of coding sequences. Further modifications to baculovirus vectors include the insertion of the beta-galactosidase gene which is of use for the screening of recombinant viruses by blue colour selection (Vialard et al 1990) or the addition of a histidine tag (i.e. pBlue Bac His ABC) which can be used for the purification of the expressed protein on nickel columns. Vectors are also commercially available which allow for the insertion of multiple coding sequences (i.e. p2Bac). Careful consideration must be given when selecting the vector and designing the insert. The vector may be such that the insert is fused to the polyhedrin gene, in which case the translation initiation codon of the novel gene is not required but subsequent amino acids are inserted in-frame (i.e. pAC360). In non-fusion vectors (i.e. pVL1392 and pVL1393) there is a mutation (ATG to ATI')in the initiation codon of the polyhedrin gene, resulting in a requirement for an ATG codon in the inserted gene. The baculovirus transfer vector pV-I-bac (Tessier et al 1991) contains the honeybee mellitin signal sequence under the control of the polyhedrin promoter; this construct has been used successfully by Sisk et al (1994) to substitute for the signal sequence of HSV-1 gD, enabling up to 25 mg of protein to be purified from one litre of culture medium.",

Further, raccoon poxvirus has been used to express the rabies virus glycoprotein which has been used to vaccinate sheep (DeMartini et al 1993) . Cytotoxic T-cells have been induced by inoculation with such viruses expressing the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Cox et al 1993) . Pox viruses have the advantage of having a large genome which can accommodate additional genes, high levels of expression, and a cytoplasmic site of transcription. For their construction, the gene of interest is cloned into a non-essential gene locus such as thymidine kinase. Recombinants are selected on the basis of their growth in TK-cells in the presence of the toxic analogue BUdR. Vaccinia virus recombinants have been used extensively for the study of both cellular and humoral immune responses to virus infection. For a review on the use of vaccinia virus on T-cell studies see Bennink and Yewdell (1990) . The vaccinia T7 system has been used extensively to transcribe and translate proteins that are encoded under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Cells are infected with the vaccinia virus recombinant expressing the T7 enzyme which are then transfected with the plasmid containing the gene under the control of T7.

Placing the bottle with packed, washed cells in an ice bath, slowly add ice-cold virus supernatant (from ) to the cells at the final ratio of 60 ml of virus to 40 ml of packed erythrocytes. [Note: For influenza and mumps viruses grown in embryonated eggs, 95 ml of cold fluid harvest per 10 ml of packed chicken red cells is generally sufficient.] Mix gently and frequently over a 2 h adsorption period. 6. Pack the red cells by centrifugation at 1000 g for 15 min at 0~ If removing hemagglutinins from a CF, EIA, or other antigen preparation, save the supernatant and stop here. If preparing an HA antigen, discard the supernatant and proceed as follows. 7. Wash the cells three times under the same centrifugation conditions, always discarding the supernatant. It is critical to re-suspend the cells as gently as possible at each wash step, preferably using a wooden applicator stick. 8. Elute the virus or hemagglutinins from the red cells by two successive incubations, each with 10 ml of PBS for 40-60 rain at 38~ with frequent gentle agitation, followed by centrifugation as above but at ambient temperature. Collect the supernatant, now containing the virus or hemagglutinins. 9. Pool the two eluates and test for virus or antigen titer, as appropriate. Thimerosal may be added to 0.01% final concentration as a preservative. Assuming a starting volume of 60 ml of virus, this yields a 3x concentration of virus that is free of all cell and medium components and all nonintact virus, non-HA antigen viral components. Some erythrocyte membranes and proteins, however, may be picked up in the elutions by disintegration of some red blood cells.",
