Cytopathic effects (CPE) induced by DENV-2 New Guinea C strain (including degenerative morphological changes, detachment, membrane degradation and death of host cells), were reflected by drastic decrease in impedance signal response detected as early as $ 30 hours post-infection (hpi). In contrast, distinct CPE by conventional microscopy was evident only at $ 72 hpi at the corresponding multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. A parameter that describes the kinetics of cytopathogenesis, CIT 50 , which refers to the time taken for 50% reduction in impedance signal response, revealed an inverse linear relationship with virus titer and MOI. CIT 50 values were also delayed by 31.5 h for each order of magnitude decrease in MOI. Therefore, based on the analysis of CIT 50 , the virus titer of a given sample can be determined from the measured impedance signal response. Furthermore, consistent impedance results were also obtained with clinical isolates of the four DENV serotypes verified by RT-PCR and cycle sequencing. This impedimetric cell-based biosensor represents a label-free and continuous approach for the dynamic measurement of cellular responses toward DENV infection, and for detecting the presence of infectious viral particles.",

In confronting these infectious diseases that spread well beyond the initial affected regions, their surveillance and control often create serious challenges for public health organizations. Hence, the development of rapid, effective and safe virus detection tools has become a major priority of the global community. Current clinical laboratory virus detection tests based on real-time and multiplex PCR techniques, provide a promising platform for simultaneous nucleic acid amplification and detection of multiple target sequences in a single test (Caliendo, 2011; Gullett and Nolte, 2015) . However, these molecular techniques are incapable of identifying live infectious viral particles since they detect the nucleic acids originating from both infectious and noninfectious viruses. Virus samples usually comprise high viral particle-to-plaque-forming unit or PFU ratio , which may indicate that the minority of viruses in a given sample is infectious, or the presence of non-infectious viruses with mutated or damaged genomes, or failure of most of the viruses to successfully infect due to the complexity of the infection cycle (van der Schaar et al., 2007) . Proof of infectious viral particles is highly important and can only be accomplished by conventional cell culture assays, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Clearly, it is essential to develop an effective and simple virus detection tool for the assessment of virulence and identification of infectious viral particles to aid in the control of an epidemic.",

Cell-based assays using adherent mammalian cell cultures such as fibroblast and endothelial cells have been utilized in toxicological and virological studies (Peters et al., 2012; Hofmann et al., 2013) . Since the first reported application of EIS in cell culture study (Giaever Contents and Keese, 1984) , this technique has been widely employed for in vitro monitoring of dynamic responses of cells toward drugs, toxic agents and pathogens (Kiilerich-Pedersen et al., 2011; Asphahani et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2012) . Principally, the EIS cell-based analytical system involves quantitative monitoring of the spreading, morphology and viability of adhered cell cultures in real-time, by applying a constant alternating current (AC) electric field. Due to the low conductivity of cellular membrane, formation of a confluent cell monolayer on the electrode surface often constricts current flow. The corresponding change in impedance signal response can be continuously monitored to obtain information on cellular growth or coverage on the electrode surface (Cheung et al., 2005) . Ultrasensitive impedimetric methods have recently reported non-invasive cell-based analyses of viral infections including herpes simplex virus infection of Vero cells (Cho et al., 2007) , human cytomegalovirus infection of human fibroblasts (Kiilerich-Pedersen et al., 2011) , and bluetongue virus infection of bovine endothelial cells (Drew et al., 2010) . The direct, real-time investigation of DENV-induced cytopathogenesis in mammalian fibroblast cells using the EIS cell-based analytical system is first reported in this study.",

            "text": "Mosquito-borne dengue infections are caused by single-stranded RNA-containing DENV which is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. DENV exists as four antigenically distinct serotypes designated DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4 (Teles, 2011) . Among the serotypes, secondary infection with DENV-2 has proven to be responsible for the more severe symptoms of dengue fever (Vaughn et al., 2000) . Invasion of host cells by lytic viruses such as DENV will ultimately result in degenerative changes and damage to host cells, known as cytopathic or cytopathogenic effects (CPE). Such effects are generally characterized by degenerative morphological changes, detachment, membrane degradation and eventual death of cells. In general, decreased tight junctions between cells, and increased separation between cells and electrode arising from CPE may lead to decreased impedance signal response. In comparison to conventional inspection methods such as microscopy and plaque assay that rely on observable changes in the morphology and surface coverage of cells, the EIS technique offers a more promising platform for studying virus-host interactions based on the real-time measurement of CPE-induced impedance response (Cho et al., 2007) .",

The sensitivity of the biosensing system is enhanced using SPCE, which constricts the current to flow within a small area of working electrode (Campbell et al., 2007; Alonso-Lomillo et al., 2010) . Furthermore, adherence of a cationic polymeric film (PLL) onto SPCE significantly improves the attachment and spreading of cells (Mazia et al., 1975; Sanders et al., 1975; Frey and Corn, 1996; Carrier and P\u00e9zolet, 1984; Khademhosseini et al., 2004; Sitterley, 2008) .

The configuration of PLL in solution changes from random coil to \u03b1-helix at about pH 10. Subsequent heating to 80\u00b0C promotes the transformation of the PLL film into the \u03b2-sheet configuration, which is believed to comprise chains that are partially cross-linked by hydrogen bonding. The cyclic voltammograms of the PLL-modified SPCE obtained in the presence of 1.0 mM Fe(CN) 6 3 \u00c0 /4 \u00c0 in 1 \u00c2 PBS, pH 7.4 ( Fig. 2(A) ) indicated fairly constant CV peak current responses for 100 repetitive potential cycles with RSD values of 5.71% and 2.90% for anodic and cathodic peak currents, respectively. This excellent stability of current response reflected strong adherence of the PLL film to the carbon working electrode surface. In comparison to other electrode surfaces such as platinum and glassy carbon, PLL has been shown to be more resilient and strongly adhered onto the rough surface of screen-printed carbon (Fogg et al., 1995) . The contrasting behavior of a bare SPCE and a SPCE modified with 0.01% (w/v) PLL toward the redox couple Fe(CN) 6 3 \u00c0 /4 \u00c0 is shown in Fig. 2(B) . The cyclic voltammograms of the PLL-modified SPCE exhibited a more reversible current response. Coating of electrode surface with a layer of cationic polymer PLL reduces the electrode overpotential and facilitates the redox reaction of anionic redox probes such as Fe(CN) 6 3 \u00c0 /4 \u00c0 at the electrode surface. This enhanced anionic exchange capability of the cationic polymer-modified electrode is indicated by a 60.65% increase in CV peak current response compared to a bare electrode (Fig. 2(B) ).",

Despite their good biocompatibility, the utility of these methods is limited by the instability, weak adherence to the electrode surface, and poor cell capture capability. In this study, the positively charged PLL coating was adopted owing to its excellent cell capture capability and strong adherence to carbon electrode surface. Various studies have documented that adherent cell lines such as fibroblast and endothelial cells possess an overall negative surface charge, which facilitates their adhesion to positively charged surface (Somosy et al., 1986; Singh et al., 1992; Hamdan et al., 2006) . This negative surface charge may be attributed to the carboxylic groups of aspartic and glutamic acid (pKa \u00bc3.9-4.2) of proteins, carboxylic groups of sialic acid (pKa \u00bc2.8) of glycoproteins, phosphate groups (pKa\u00bc 2.0), and sulfate groups (pKa\u00bc 1.9) of sulphated proteoglycans or glycoproteins (Singh et al., 1992) . Another explanation is that their extracellular matrix is rich in negatively charged glucosaminoglycans (Somosy et al., 1986) , thus suggesting that the observed cell adhesion behavior is mainly electrostatic in nature. The enhanced cationic properties of PLL-modified carbon electrode are therefore responsible for the strong adhesion of BHK-21 cells.",

BHK-21 cells constitute a type of adherent fibroblast cells, derived by single-cell isolation from the kidneys of five Syrian golden hamsters, Mesocricetus auratus (Stoker and Macpherson, 1964) . This cell line is susceptible to infection by DENV, vesicular stomatitis virus, reovirus, and human adenovirus. The Bode diagram shown in Fig. 3(A) was generated from EIS spectra recorded at a frequency ranging from 100 Hz to 1 MHz. In the absence of electron mediator or redox probe, the electrode impedance of cells is limited by stray capacitance at high frequency and electrode polarization at low frequency. Moderate frequency (1-10 kHz) is well-suited for probing the cellular morphological changes induced by viral infection or cytotoxicants (McCoy and Wang, 2005; Campbell et al., 2007; Cho et al., 2007) . The intermediate frequency at which the impedance signal was most affected by the change in cellular morphology was $ 4 kHz ( Fig. 3(A) ), where the impedance signals measured between cells prior to virus inoculation and during day 5 of viral infection (at MOI\u00bc5) were considerably different from each other. Thus, the EIS data recorded at 4 kHz appear to provide meaningful results which may correlate with the morphological dynamics of cells and the kinetics of DENV-induced cytopathogenesis. This finding was further extended to the infection monitoring experiments where the impedance readings of cell adhesion and subsequent DENV infection were monitored at 4 kHz every 30 min up to 160 h.",

            "text": "The DENV infection process involves several stages: attachment of viral envelope glycoprotein to cellular receptors such as dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), heparin sulfate or cell surface immunoglobulin (Chen et al., 1997; Tassaneetrithep et al., 2003) . After fusion with the plasma membrane, viruses are enveloped in an acidified endocytic vesicle known as endosome, and subsequently release RNA into cytoplasm. Virus replication would eventually trigger membrane degradation and release viral progeny into the extracellular environment. In general, viral invasion of host cells induces a series of intra-and inter-cellular remodeling processes, which ultimately lead to changes in tight junctions between cells, and the distance between cells and electrode. Fig. 3(B) shows the normalized impedance signal response as a function of viral infection time at different MOI. This plot reveals information on the attachment and growth of cells on the electrode surface, morphological dynamics of cells, and kinetics of viral-induced cytopathogenesis. Due to the low conductivity of cell membranes, the flow of moderate frequency current at the cellelectrode or cell-cell interface is sensitively influenced by nanometer changes in the adhesion regions or tight junctions between cells (Cheung et al., 2005) . Thus, a gradual increase in the electrode impedance observed during cell culture indicates that cells are actively propagating and densely populating onto the PLL-modified carbon electrode surface. Impedance signal keeps on increasing after virus inoculation as cells continue to grow until cytopathogenesis induces a series of cellular remodeling processes that influence the morphology and adhesion of cells on the electrode surface. Viral-induced cytopathogenesis often results in severe morphological and physical changes, detachment of cells from surface, and eventual cell death (Campbell et al., 2007) . In Fig. 3(B) , fluctuation of the normalized impedance signal signifies the onset of CPE induced by DENV-2 NGC strain, followed by a drastic reduction in impedance signal response, which could be detected as early as $30 hpi at MOI of 10. Moreover, after the observed CPE, the normalized impedance signal of the cell-based biosensor declined by 50% at $ 69 hpi. Technically, this particular time taken for 50% reduction in the cell impedance response is termed CIT 50, a kinetic parameter typically used to characterize the viral-induced cytopathic events (Fang et al., 2011) . To further characterize the viral-induced cytopathogenesis, CIT 50 was regressed as a function of virus titer in the logarithm of MOI. Fig. 3 (C) displays an inverse linear relationship between virus titers and CIT 50 values (R 2 \u00bc0.955). The resultant regression indicates that CIT 50 was delayed by 31.5 h for each order of magnitude decrease in MOI. Therefore, the dependence of the CPE-induced impedance signal response on the viral infectious dose permits the estimation of virus titers of viral samples based on the measured impedance signals.",

A control experiment using BHK-21 cells in the absence of DENV (represented by the black line in Fig. 3 (B) produced a gradual increment in impedance signal with time. Clearly, BHK-21 cells cultured in growth medium remain viable and actively propagate on the electrode surface. The normalized impedance signal reaches its maximum after $ 5 days of incubation with growth medium where the electrode surface is fully covered with cells. Another control experiment using a PLLmodified SPCE immersed in growth medium in the absence of BHK-21 cells and DENV gave a fairly constant impedance signal over a period of 6 days (data not shown). Fig. 4 shows the control experiments using different host cells infected with DENV-2 NGC strain at MOI of 5. In the control using biosensor prepared with Vero cells, a commonly used mammalian cell line, the electrode impedance increased initially as the Vero cells grew and reached a plateau from days 3 to 6. Another control using the C6/36 Aedes albopictus mosquito cell line produced a fairly constant impedance signal from days 0 to 5, thus revealing poor attachment and spreading of C6/36 cells on the PLL-modified carbon electrode surface. In summary, DENV-induced CPE could not be observed with Vero and C6/36 cell lines even at a relatively high MOI of 5. This suggests that the impedance response is specific to BHK-21 cells and may not relevant to other cell lines. In summary, decrease in impedance signal could only be detected with the occurrence of DENV-induced cytopathogenesis of the BHK-21 fibroblast cell line.",

Their nucleotide sequences exhibit high identities to isolates RR121 (92%), 1046DN/1976 (97%), TB16 (97%), and 475A (99%), respectively. Infection of BHK-21 cells with the four clinical isolates of DENV was monitored by using the procedures described for the NGC strain. Fig. 6 (B) displays similar CPEinduced impedance signals for the four clinical isolates (at MOI of 5). Slight variation in CPE detection time may possibly be attributed to the varying degrees of CPE induced by these clinical DENV strains. In summary, CPE induced by the four clinical isolates of DENV could be detected within 1-2 days post-infection. The performance of this impedimetric cell-based biosensor underscores its utility for the analysis of clinical DENV isolates. Future studies are warranted to evaluate this biosensor for the analysis of actual clinical specimens from dengue patients, e.g. blood samples (Seah et al., 1995b; Phanthanawiboon et al., 2014) .",

This impedimetric biosensing system outperforms conventional microscopic inspection that requires 3-5 days of DENV infection to conclusively observe the changes in morphology and surface coverage of cells. Other attractive features of this cell-based biosensor include the possibility of automation, non-invasive measurement, reduced timeframe for the diagnosis of live DENV infection, mediatorless and label-free monitoring procedure, and capability of detecting the presence of infectious dengue viral particles to complement existing diagnostic tests such as RT-PCR and serology. In addition, virus titers of given viral samples can be estimated from the measured impedance signals by analysis of CIT 50 values. The utility of this impedimetric cell-based biosensor for detecting clinical infectious viral isolates also demonstrates its potential application in the clinical setting.",
