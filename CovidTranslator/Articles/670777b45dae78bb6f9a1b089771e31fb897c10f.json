An individual that has contracted the two-stage contagious disease will initially show no symptoms of the disease but is capable of spreading it. If the initial stages are not detected which could lead to complications eventually, then symptoms start appearing in the latter stage when it would be necessary to perform expensive treatment. Under a constrained budget situation, policymakers are faced with the decision of how to allocate budget for prevention (via vaccinations), subsidizing treatment, and examination to detect the presence of initial stages of the contagious disease. These decisions need to be performed in each period of a given time horizon. To aid this decision-making exercise, we formulate a stochastic dynamic optimal control problem with feedback which can be modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). However, solving the MDP is computationally intractable due to the large state space as the embedded stochastic network cannot be decomposed. Hence we propose an asymptotically optimal solution based on a fluid model of the dynamics in the stochastic network. We heuristically fine-tune the asymptotically optimal solution for the non-asymptotic case, and test it extensively for several numerical cases. In particular we investigate the effect of budget, length of planning horizon, type of disease, population size, and ratio of costs on the policy for budget allocation.",

Although the description pertains to humans, the models can be suitably extended to other living beings as well. We state the problem in an abstract manner and do not concentrate on any specific disease, however we restrict our study to two-phase contagious diseases. These diseases are such that when a person contracts the disease, he or she does not show any symptoms in the initial phase but can spread the disease. This initial phase is called the latent stage. In the latter phase of the disease, symptoms may appear and the individual may need to be treated, typically using expensive treatments. The latter phase is usually referred to as the symptomatic stage. If an individual is healthy, shots (usually vaccines) can be administered so that he or she does not contract the contagious disease at least for a period of time. If an individual is in the initial phase of the disease, he or she can be treated inexpensively (as opposed to when the symptoms appear) and can be cautious about not spreading the disease. Notice that individuals that are healthy cannot be distinguished from those that are in the initial stages of the disease, unless tested. The spread of such contagious diseases can be contained by testing individuals, giving shots to healthy individuals and treatment to individuals known to have the disease. The objective of this paper is to devise an algorithm to optimally allocate financial resources for testing, vaccination, and treatment by evaluating their trade-offs across a finite planning horizon.",

            "text": "The main goal of this paper is to present an analytic framework that can be used for a wide range of two-phase contagious diseases. However, for the sake of clarity in exposition, we present a few examples. In particular, AIDS and cervical cancer can be modeled as two-stage contagious diseases where the first stage is contracting the virus and the second stage is getting AIDS or cervical cancer, respectively. Since cervical cancer has received a lot of attention in the media recently, there is a reasonable amount of data available for it and hence we use it for model illustration as well as numerical analysis in this paper. In that light, it is worthwhile to further describe cervical cancer briefly. The cause for almost all patients suffering from cervical cancer is Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) which can be controlled using vaccinations that lasts four years. When a healthy person contracts HPV, there are no symptoms until the person actually gets cancer, a process which may take many years (Cervical-Cancer 2006) . Therefore the two-stages of cervical cancer can be thought of as: (a) having HPV but not cancer; (b) having cancer for which treatment is required (such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy (Cervical-Cancer-Center 2006) ). On the brighter side, treatments for cervical cancer are fairly successful (AICR 2006) . However the cost of treatment is significantly higher than many other cancers, such as breast cancer, hence not all patients can afford the treatment (Wolstenholme and Whynes 1998) .",

However, it is worthwhile noting that policies from a management standpoint in terms of the spread of these diseases mentioned above have been well established. Where there is a serious shortcoming is in being prepared against newly emerging disease outbreaks in which human beings are infected by agents (such as bacteria or viruses) that spread even before any symptoms are observed. These agents could have a long incubation period (i.e. the time between when an individual is infected to when symptoms appear). In addition, the disease could be communicable (i.e. the agent spreads to other individuals) even during the incubation period. Under these circumstances there is a need to perform quick what-if analysis with limited data to make policy decisions. The major concern is the impact in terms of large-scale testing, vaccination, and treatment that would overwhelm existing resources.",

Modeling and analyzing this problem deals with multi-dimensional decision variables under a stochasticnetwork environment. Thus, it difficult to analyze the system using dynamic programming. There are a relatively large number of states in this system and the transition rates are also dependent upon the state of the system. In essence, the budget allocation problem over a finite horizon is a complex stochastic dynamic program where the objective is to determine the optimal set of actions in each stage of the horizon which is a dynamic control problem with feedback. The contribution of this paper is in not only providing a tool for policymakers to effectively divide a given budget for a specific two-stage disease in healthcare, but also to develop a methodology to handle complex dynamic control problems effectively.",

            "text": "Mathematical modeling of epidemic diseases has been an active area of research since the 1920s. A number of statistical models have been developed in order to be able to predict various factors, such as the spread rate of the disease, the number of infected people, mortality rate, etc. within a given time horizon. Early research was mainly devoted to developing deterministic models. This is mainly due to the fact that these models are simpler. Anderson and May (1991) studied various existing deterministic models, along with several applications based on real data. Stochastic epidemic models started to come around with the one proposed by McKendrick (1926) . This work was a stochastic continuous time version of the deterministic model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick (1927) . Reed and Frost introduced the chain-binomial model (Andersson and Britton 2000) . Barlett (1949) studied the stochastic version of the Kermack-McKendrick model. Since then, a substantial amount of research has been done in this field. For example, Gabriel et al. (1990) , Bailey (1975) and Anderson and May (1991) are excellent resources that have covered stochastic as well as deterministic models. These sources also discuss the statistical inference and a large number of applications to real data. Further, Daley and Ganni (1999) reviewed the existing stochastic and deterministic models and included statistical inference. Andersson and Britton (2000) provided a summary of stochastic models that are being used in the area. In addition, Diekmann and Heesterbeek (2000) focused on mathematical epidemiology of infectious diseases and used real data for illustrations.",

Different researchers use different methods to obtain this probability, e.g., the contact number as defined by Hethcote (2000) . If a susceptible person has contact with the infectious person, he/she becomes infectious and is immediately able to infect other individuals. There is usually a distribution assigned to the duration of the infectious period. An individual is considered removed (R) when he/she becomes immune to the disease after his/her infectious period is over, and plays no further part in the spread of the disease.

They used stochastic simulation to show the robustness of outcomes of the model, such as reproductive numbers. Elbasha et al. (2007) developed a model to investigate the transmission dynamics of HPV.

The results showed that the vaccination age plays an important role in the overall immunity of the society but including boys is not cost-efficient. Garnett et al.

In Sect. 4, we leveraged upon the results of these works to restrict the set of possible actions. Gray et al. (2003) studied the dynamic of HIV transmission in Rakai, Uganda. They used a stochastic simulation model to observe the effect of vaccination and antiviral treatment. They showed that antiviral treatment can reduce the number of infected people, however the treatment alone cannot stop the epidemic since it will result in more infected people in future. They found vaccination to be more effective in controlling the virus transmission than the treatment. Therefore, combination of two may achieve a promising result.",

Notice that the MDP formulation in Sect. 4.2, is a stochastic optimal control problem with feedback and the corresponding fluid model can be thought of as an optimal control problem without feedback (as there is no uncertainty in terms of the state of the system in the deterministic case). The feedback would not provide any new information in the decision-making process since the dynamics are deterministic. However, in the real system the feedback would be somewhat different than what is predicted and hence we need an algorithm to adjust based on the feedback. In summary, we consider a fluid model where the aim is to obtain a dynamic control without feedback. In other words, the set of control actions A = (X, Y, Z) can be set a priori and they depend only on the knowledge of the initial system state W 0 (and other states W n for n = 1, 2, . . . , T are known only probabilistically). A major portion of the approximate analysis description would revolve around this dynamic control problem without feedback. However toward the end of this section we describe how to extend this to the case of dynamic control with feedback as a sequential approximation (see Sect. 5.3).",

We take advantage of this observation to Fig. 1 Meta-heuristic and objective function evaluation engine develop our approximate algorithm. In particular, we select a meta-heuristic to efficiently search through the space of all possible values of X, Y , and Z. One of the key requirements for the meta-heuristic is an engine that would evaluate the objective function for a given (X, Y, Z). This is depicted in Fig. 1 . Our goal in this paper is to select an appropriate metaheuristic and to develop alternative methodologies to evaluate the objective function (i.e. objective function evaluating engine) for a given set of X, Y and Z values.

We arbitrarily assume the recovery probabilities as p r2 = 0.02, p r3 = 0.04, p y1 = 0.6, p y2 = 0.3, p y3 = 0.1. Note that the latter probabilities are relatively high, due to the high chance of recovering from HPV and success of surgical treatment of cervical cancer (Cervical-Cancer-Treatment 2006) . We would like to particularly emphasize that we consider a wide range for the population of women with HPV to account for the inherent uncertainties in this number, mostly due to the declining rate of diagnosis of cervical cancer and the declining rate of cancerrelated mortality.",

We seek to evaluate the effect on the objective function by comparing that for our model versus the state of the literature. It is crucial to notice that the choice of objective function will not affect the validity of the developed methodologies. Figure 10 illustrates a comparison of the objective function where static policy refers to the state of the literature and dynamic policy refers to our proposed policy. There is over 30% improvement in the objective function by incorporating our proposed policy which is by all means extremely significant. Although we do not present the budget allocation, our results suggest a more balanced allocation for testing, vaccination and treatment subsidy as opposed to investing only in vaccination.

It is critical to understand a few nuances with respect to HIV. First of all there is not a 100% effective vaccine against HIV (efficiency is 25-75% (Gray et al. 2003) ). Secondly, although we have kept several model parameters similar (population, budget, etc.) , there still are differences between HPV/Cervical-Cancer and HIV/AIDS. The main differences are: There is higher chance getting AIDS after having the HIV than getting cervical cancer after being infected by HPV; The most common treatment for cervical cancer is by surgery (more costly) which is a onetime action, however in the case of AIDS the treatment is over time and by using drugs (less costly); The HPV vaccine is effective for 4 years and after that it should be repeated, but for HIV the chance of immunity is low but it remains for longer time.

In order to address that issue we consider two planning horizons and compare the policies for them: 20 years and 5 years. An interesting result from a modeling standpoint that is that as the planning horizon becomes shorter, the difference between having feedback and not having the feedback in dynamic policy becomes more significant (since in a long horizon we anticipate deviations from predicted states to average out). We evaluate by comparing the Fig. 12 which shows the effect of length of planning horizon on the policy. Note that only the first five bars in the charts since that is the place the two policies can be compared.",

In other words, longer horizon emphasizes on the value of future, which is exactly the reason for vaccinating. We compare the graphs, in the first 5 periods the short horizon model assigns most of the money to treatment whereas in long term horizon a significant portion of the budget was allocated to vaccination in the first 5 periods.",

We use the ratio of examination cost to the vaccination cost. As illustrated in Fig. 13 , the ratio increases to 0.8 (meaning the cost of examination is close to vaccination cost), there are more vaccination. Since the basic reason of having examination is preventing the cost We observe in Fig. 13 that the effect of the ratio is not smooth. Instead of fixing the vaccination cost and just changing the examination cost (which would have resulted in a smooth curve), we emphasize that besides the ratio, the individual cost parameters are also crucial. Therefore the figure shows the effect on number of vaccination and examination as the cost ratio (exam/vaccine) increases. The reason that the number of examination does not converge to zero even when it costs more than vaccination is that examination has two other advantages in our model: the people who know they have the virus have a smaller chance of getting cancer (they can take better care) and also a better chance of recovering.",

However, when the population size is not as large (small is still over 50,000) it appears as if it would make more sense to spend more on treatment than either of the other two options.

The methodologies developed in this paper, are independent of the choice of objective functions and can be adapted to variety of real world policy making decisions. The decision-support tool would also need appropriate parameters as well as model for disease spread which would typically be provided by epidemiologists. Further, to make our recommendations, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) problem to obtain the optimal dynamic control with feedback. However since solving the MDP is computationally intractable, we use an asymptotic optimal policy based on a fluid model of the stochastic network dynamics. This results in dynamic policies without feedback that we iteratively solve for the feedback case as information rolls in. The paper uses a genetic algorithm which heuristically searches through the space of possible actions and evaluates the objective function value for each candidate action. One of the contributions is the development of methods to characterize the objective function value for a given action vector.",

In our experiments the static policy took an average of 13 seconds using the deterministic methodology whereas 25 seconds on average with simulations. The dynamic policy without feedback was only fractionally slower. For that the deterministic version took 15 seconds and the simulation methodology took 27 seconds on average. However, the dynamic policy with feedback which only runs as a simulation took about 8300 seconds on average, although it could take up to a day in the worst case. Further, we ran several sensitivity analysis experiments and they indicate that the results are fairly robust.

In particular, by comparing against existing HPV vaccination policy of vaccinating 70% of eligible population, our policy seems to perform much better in improving the objective function. In essence it would be worthwhile using the budget for examinations (essentially incentives) and treatment. Further, to study how the policies differ between HIV-AIDS and HPV. Since HIV vaccination is not as effective, it is natural to devote more of the budget to examination and treatment as compared to HPV. We also find that since the impact of vaccinations cannot be realized in a short time-horizon, the decisions are significantly different for both HPV and HIV. In addition, for both HIV and HPV as the population size becomes small it is more effective to use a larger fraction of the budget for treatment (as opposed to the large population where the budget is spent more-or-less evenly between testing, vaccination and treatment). Returning to the HPV incentives for examinations, it appears that using a weak incentive would favor more examinations versus vaccinations and vice versa (contradicting human behavior) forces policymakers to consider this issue more closely.",

This is critical and would have to be considered while building a decisionsupport tool where the eventual solution should be checked for robustness with respect to perturbation of the model parameters.

In fact one could also include herd immunity which is gaining a lot of importance in large-scale vaccinations. Although we have not explicitly considered herd immunity, there is an implicit provision for that in our proposed framework. In particular, our model considers spread of disease as a function of the number of individuals who are not being vaccinated. This way, herd immunity can be incorporated into our proposed framework. However, considering the focus of this paper and space limitations, we feel herd immunity is best left as a limitation of our study.",
