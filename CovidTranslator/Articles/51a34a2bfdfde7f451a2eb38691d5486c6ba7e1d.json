Cell culture media is an intricate mixture of numerous chemical constituents and cells that collectively produce complicated mass spectra. Cholesterol and free fatty acids were identified and attributed to lipid sources in the media (blood serum supplement and plasma membranes of host cells). These lipid moieties could be utilized as signature markers for rapidly detecting the cell culture media. Viruses are intracellular parasites and are dependent upon host cells in order to exist. Therefore, it is highly probable that significant quantities of media needed to grow and maintain viable host cells would be present if a viral agent were disseminated as an aerosol into the environment. Cholesterol was also detected from a purified virus sample, further substantiating its use as a target compound for detection. Implications of this research for detection of viral bioaerosols, using a field-portable pyrolysis mass spectrometer, is described. (J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 1999, 10, 502-511) ",

Mass spectrometry coupled with pyrolysis is a well established method for the elucidation of biomarkers [9 -12] and the differentiation of whole cell bacteria [5, 13] and fungi [14, 15] . Viruses, however, have not been extensively studied by Py-MS. To our knowledge, only two reports describing the application of Py-MS to the study and characterization of viruses have been published. Tas and co-workers, in one of these reports, evaluated the use of Py-MS for differentiating cell culture media infected with viruses from blank media not infected with a virus [16] . In the other report, Windig et al. utilized Py-MS for testing poliovirus suspensions separated by column chromatography for DEAE-sephadex impurity [17] . The focus of both papers was on the use of pattern recognition techniques for differentiating pyrolysis mass spectra, but neither paper identified mass spectral peaks of taxonomic significance to either the virus or the cell culture media. A more thorough investigation of media containing viruses is therefore required in order to evaluate the potential use of Py-MS for detecting aerosolized viral media.",

Several groups of viruses that are transmissible in aerosolized form are suspected agents for biological weaponry [18, 19] . These viral agents might not be purified prior to use, therefore detection schemes must account for situations in which only a small amount of the virus is present in a large quantity of culture media. The media in these samples would likely overwhelm any signal generated by the viruses and thus make direct detection of the viruses extremely difficult, if not impossible. On the other hand, the culture media itself should be amenable to detection. Detection of aerosolized culture media in the environment would strongly suggest the presence of a viral agent.",

Growth and maintenance media are isotonic solutions that furnish cells with nutrients and vitamins while regulating the pH and electrolyte balance [21] . The growth media is also routinely supplemented with blood serum (5%-20% v/v) which provides the cells with additional nutrients and growth factors such as hormones, trace elements, minerals, and lipids [21] . Antibiotics are also added to the culture to inhibit bacterial contamination. Viruses are usually harvested by physical lysis of the infected host cells, a practice which further complicates the culture milieu by releasing intracellular biochemical constituents. Figure 1a , b displays the mass spectra of supernatants recovered from a Vero cell culture infected with VEE and media from a Vero cell culture that was not infected. Many of the peaks observed in the two spectra are fragment ions generally attributed to the pyrolysis of proteins and free amino acids [22, 23] . In addition, ion fragments from the other classes of biomolecules (lipids, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates) also contribute to the spectral peaks observed for the cell culture media [24] . The two mass spectra are similar both qualitatively and quantitatively. The relative proportions of biomolecules apparently remains constant between the two cell cultures despite one being infected with the VEE virus.",

Because the two mass spectra in Figure 1a , b are nearly identical it is presumed that the contribution of the virus is negligible, otherwise a noticeable difference in peak ratios between the two spectra would be visibly apparent. This result was not unexpected, considering that the yield of viral mass from infected cells is small (\u03f30.1% w/w) relative to the overall masses of the host cells and growth media. The chemical signal originating from the cell culture media dominates the spectra of the unpurified viral media overwhelming the peaks generated from the viruses.

Cholesterol, in particular, is an excellent candi-date biomarker for the detection of cell culture media by Py-MS because it produces intense molecular and fragment ions. The corresponding mass spectral peaks of cholesterol are easily discernable and provide a rapid scheme for differentiating eukaryotic cell cultures from prokaryotic culture media. Cholesterol is not generally found in media used to cultivate bacteria or in the bacteria themselves. Figure 6b shows the spectrum of Yersinia pestis grown in trypticase soy broth. No cholesterol ions are observed in this mass spectrum.",

We believe that these biomarkers will allow detection of aerosolized viral media in real time using a field-portable, ion trap Py-MS. To substantiate this proposal, an extensive examination of aerosolized viral media using the field-portable unit will need to be conducted in the near future. As part of this study, limits of detection and potential interferents such as diesel fuels, cleaning reagents, pesticides, automobile exhausts, and other common background constituents will also need to be evaluated. The concentration of aerosolized cholesterol is not expected to be high for normal atmospheric samples, thus validating its use as a targeted marker for detection of culture media.",
