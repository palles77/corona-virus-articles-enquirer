            "text": "The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad is particularly useful in situations where a rapid clinical syndromic diagnosis is needed, ie, during an H1N1 pandemic. (Heart Lung\u00d2 2010;39:249-259.) L egionnaire's disease is the term given to pneumonias caused by any Legionella spp. Legionella pneumophila is the most common Legionella sp. causing pneumonia in humans. Six Legionella species account for the majority of pneumonias in humans. Legionnaires' disease is a systemic infection involving the lungs, and is accompanied by a variety of extrapulmonary manifestations. 1, 2 Legionnaires' disease is the cause of communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) as well as nursing homeacquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia, ie, nosocomial pneumonias. [3] [4] [5] The Legionella sp. CAP occurs sporadically in communities where Legionella is in the aqueous environment. 3 Legionnaire's disease as a cause of nursing home-acquired or nosocomial pneumonias occur in outbreaks. 4 Outbreaks in nursing homes or hospitals are invariably related to the aerosolization of Legionella-contaminated water, eg, cooling towers, air-conditioning units, ice cubes, showers, or water in general. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Legionella are small, aerobic, Gram-negative bacilli that do not stain well using a Gram stain. In tissue, they appear as coccobacillary forms, and in a solidculture medium are filamentous. Legionella spp. require L-cysteine for growth, and iron salts enhance growth. Legionella cannot be cultured on standard solid media, and are best cultured on buffered yeast charcoal extract agar. 3 A diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease may be rendered through culturing respiratory secretions or lung specimens. Legionella may also be demonstrated in respiratory secretions by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) techniques, using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies. The positivity of DFAs decreases rapidly after treatment, but the DFAs of respiratory secretions, when positive, allow for the most rapid diagnostic test available early in Legionnaires' disease. More commonly, Legionnaires' disease is diagnosed serologically by demonstrating a single high titer or rising titers between acute and convalescent specimens. Legionella seroconversion commonly takes 4 to 6 weeks. For this reason, many patients with Legionnaires' disease often have negative initial titers, making early diagnosis difficult. Very few patients have repeat titers at 4 to 6 weeks after discharge. Legionnaires' disease attributable to Legionella pneumophila (serotypes 01-06) may also be diagnosed using the Legionella antigen test. Legionella antigenuria takes 2 to 3 weeks to become detectable in urine, but persists for months after an infection. The main value of the Legionella urinary antigen test involves its persistent positivity for weeks or months, permitting a retrospective diagnosis, particularly in cases where Legionella titers were initially negative. However, the Legionella antigen test is positive only when Legionnaires' disease is caused by Legionella pneumophila (serotypes 01-06). 3, 5 Since the first description of Legionnaires' disease after the Philadelphia outbreak of 1976, physicians have sought to determine whether any clinical or nonclinical laboratory features of Legionnaires' disease would permit differentiation of Legionnaires' disease from typical bacterial CAPs. 1 Typical bacterial CAPs are most commonly attributable to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or M. catarrhalis, and are infections confined to the lungs, without extrapulmonary findings. Legionnaire's disease, like other atypical CAP pathogens, is a systemic infection with pneumonia. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] The most common atypical CAPs are associated with extrapulmonary findings, ie, zoonotic and nonzoonotic atypical CAPs. The most common atypical zoonotic CAPs are attributable to Q fever, psittacosis, or tularemia. The most common nonzoonotic atypical pneumonias are M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and Legionnaires' disease (Tables I and II) .",

The presumptive clinical diagnosis of CAPs takes into account this critically important clinical concept. The clinical features related to organ involvement in each atypical pneumonia permit a presumptive clinical diagnosis. Because the pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement is different and characteristic of each atypical CAP pathogen, clinicians can easily differentiate not only typical from atypical CAPs, but also zoonotic from nonzoonotic atypical CAP pathogens. 5, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] In the literature, studies sought to identify individual markers to differentiate Legionnaires' disease from typical CAPs. Invariably, this approach has been unsuccessful, because studies used individual parameters with no diagnostic specificity, eg, fever or hyponatremia, which may be present in both typical and atypical CAPs. 3,16-18 A presumptive clinical diagnosis of Legionnaire's disease is optimally based on a clinical syndromic diagnosis. Key extrapulmonary findings are associated with Legionnaires' disease, and by virtue of this fact, are diagnostically more useful in clinical syndromic diagnoses. 5, 15, [19] [20] [21] To take into account the differing diagnostic significance of various clinical signs and symptoms as well as nonspecific laboratory findings, a diagnostic weighted point score system was developed at ",

            "text": "The need to develop a rapid, presumptive clinical diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease arose during the ''herald wave'' of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic in New York. Winthrop-University Hospital was at the epicenter of the H1N1 pandemic in New York. The Emergency Department (ED) of the hospital was inundated with hundreds of patients with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) who presented for H1N1 testing and evaluation. The Quick Vue (A/B) test (Quidel, San Diego) for influenza A was the primary screening test for H1N1 pneumonia used in the ED. Because H1N1 is a variant of influenza A, it was hoped the rapid influenza A screening test would be a useful screening test for H1N1. Patients who were rapid influenza A test-positive were also reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive for H1N1. It was soon realized that 30% of patients who clinically had H1N1 pneumonia had negative rapid influenza A tests in the ED. Other tests, eg, respiratory fluorescent antibody (FA) viral panel tests, were ordered to increase the diagnostic yield. Unfortunately, these rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) did not correlate well with RT-PCR testing for H1N1 pneumonia. Accordingly, there was an urgent need to develop clinical criteria for the probable diagnosis of H1N1 pneumonia in patients with negative RIDTs. 23 The Infectious Disease Division of Winthrop-University Hospital developed a diagnostic weighted point score system for the probable diagnosis of H1N1 pneumonia in a hospitalized adult with negative RIDTs, based on the previous Legionnaires' disease clinical diagnostic weighted point score system. At the end of July 2009, the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA) acknowledged that the designation of probable H1N1 was equivalent to definite H1N1 via RT-PCR testing. This was announced because health departments restricted RT-PCR testing, leaving physicians with no definitive way to rule in or rule out H1N1 pneumonias in those with negative RIDTs whose specimens for RT-PCR testing were restricted.",
