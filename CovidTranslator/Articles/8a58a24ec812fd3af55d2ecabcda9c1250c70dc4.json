            "text": "Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a life-threatening form of pneumonia caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). From late 2002 to mid 2003, it infected more than 8000 people worldwide, of which a majority of cases were found in China. Owing to the absence of definitive therapeutic Western medicines, Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae) (HC) was shortlisted by Chinese scientists to tackle SARS problem as it is conventionally used to treat pneumonia. Aim of the study: The present study aimed to explore the SARS-preventing mechanisms of HC in the immunological and anti-viral aspects. Results: Results showed that HC water extract could stimulate the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes significantly and dose-dependently. By flow cytometry, it was revealed that HC increased the proportion of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Moreover, it caused a significant increase in the secretion of IL-2 and IL-10 by mouse splenic lymphocytes. In the anti-viral aspect, HC exhibited significant inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). On the other hand, oral acute toxicity test demonstrated that HC was non-toxic to laboratory animals following oral administration at 16 g/kg. Conclusion: The results of this study provided scientific data to support the efficient and safe use of HC to combat SARS.",

Anti-viral CD4 + helper T cells (Th) help the production of virus-specific antibodies by B cells, while CD8 + cytotoxic T cells (Tc) can kill virus-infected host cells. Lymphopenia was usually observed in SARS patients at the initial phase of infection (Li et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2003; He et al., 2005) . Virus-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes has been suggested as a cause for lymphopenia seen in SARS patients (O'Donnell et al., 2003) . Since monocytes and T cells are involved in both the innate and adaptive immune response, destruction of these cells may result in a compromised immune response and the development of disease. Our results demonstrated that HC extract could exhibit immunostimulatory effect ( Fig. 1; Tables 1 and 2) . It was found to stimulate the proliferation of CD4 + helper T cells and CD8 + cytotoxic T cells, which may help to prevent SARS-CoV infection. CD4 + helper T cells can be divided into different subtypes, based on the specific profiles of cytokines that they release. Th1 cells have been found to produce IL-2, IFN-\u2425 and lymphotoxin-\u2423, whereas Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 (Romagnani, 2006) . Th1 cells assist in activating macrophages and Tc cells, which are particularly useful for eliminating intracellular infections; Th2 cells mediate anti-helminth and allergic responses. Type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells are distinct from the classical Th1 or Th2 cells. They produce high levels of IL-10, with or without TGF-\u2424, IFN-\u2425 and IL-5, and low or no IL-2 and IL-4 (Veldman et al., 2006) . IL-10 has a key effect on the suppression of Th1 cell responses and has a role in host protection against harmful effects of an exacerbated cellular immune response during acute infection. In order to investigate how HC extract affect the T cell differentiation, we measured the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-\u2425 secreted by mouse splenic lymphocytes. From our results, IFN-\u2425 and IL-4 that are secreted by Th1 and Th2, respectively, did not increase. On the contrary, IL-10 that is secreted by Tr1 increased significantly after treatment. We speculated that HC extract caused the induction of Tr1. In the 3 H-thymidine incorporation assay, the stimulatory response in 72 h is lower than that of 48 h (Fig. 1 ). This may due to the negative feedback by Tr1 cells that suppress Th cells response. Induction of Tr1 cells can assist in turning off immune response after pathogen elimination and prevent harmful effect. However, further in-depth studies are needed to confirm the induction of Tr1 by HC extract.",

This functional importance of 3CL pro in the life cycle of virus makes it a key target for the development of drugs directed against SARS (Anand et al., 2003; Gan et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2006) and for screening the anti-SARS effect of traditional Chinese medicines (Lin et al., 2005) . In order to study the effect of HC extract on SARS-CoV 3CL pro , a convenient protein-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay system was set up for measuring the enzyme activity. The substrate for assay is a recombinant protein that has a cleavable linker sequence (TSAVLQ\u2193SGFRK) between two fluorescent proteins, viz CFP and YFP. The former one is the donor protein of which the emission spectrum overlaps with the excitation spectrum of the latter acceptor protein. If these two fluorophores are very close to each other, FRET will occur. When excited at 430 nm, CFP will emit fluorescent at 486 nm that will in turn excite YFP and cause it to emit fluorescent at 530 nm. If the SARS-CoV 3CL pro is active, the linker sequence will be cleaved, two fluorophores separated and the fluorescence ratio at 530/486 decreased. HC extract, at 200 g/ml or above, could effectively inhibit the decrease in fluorescence ratio of the substrate, implying that it could inactivate the SARS-CoV 3CL pro .",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is a key enzyme responsible for both positive and negative strand RNA synthesis. It is the essential enzyme in a replicase complex that is expected to contain additional viral and cellular proteins (Thiel et al., 2003) . Given the crucial role of RdRp in the virus life cycle and the success obtained with polymerase inhibitors in the treatment of viral infections including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), human hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Korba et al., 2006) , HCV and herpes virus, SARS-CoV RdRp is an attractive target for the development of anti-SARS drugs. At present, there are no structural and very limited biochemical data on coronavirus polymerase. Thus, study on the polymerization mechanisms is likely to aid the development of anti-SARS agent. It is reported that during purification, the full-length enzyme is found to be hydrolytically cleaved into three main fragments: an N-terminal p12 fragment, a middle p30 fragment, and a C-terminal p64 fragment which comprises the polymerase catalytic domain (Cheng et al., 2005) . Currently, the recombinant SARS-RdRp expressed in E. coli is characterized by radioactive assay Yamashita et al., 1998; Cheng et al., 2005) and we demonstrated that radiolabeled nucleotides incorporation increased with increasing SARS-CoV RdRp protein (Data not shown). HC extract, at 50 g/ml or above, could effectively inhibit [\u2423-32 P] UTP incorporation, implying that it can inactivate the SARS-CoV RdRp activity.",
