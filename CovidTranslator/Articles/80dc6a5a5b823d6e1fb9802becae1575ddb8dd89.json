Ebola spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) or indirect contact with infected materials, such as clothing. [5] [6] [7] As other infectious diseases, healthcare workers are at risk of infection because they have to work at the frontline, often without protections. 8, 9 Cases of contamination while treating Ebola patients rose rapidly during the current outbreak, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the new personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines for healthcare providers treating Ebola patients. [10] [11] [12] However, even with protective clothing, a healthcare worker can be contaminated if removal is not done in a manner that prevents exposure. [13] [14] [15] A limited numbers of studies have been performed regarding contamination with PPE usage. In this study, our primary aim was to evaluate contamination during doffing. The secondary purpose was to describe errors and delays during donning and doffing.",

Each person was allowed to watch the protocol and to consult their partners. Though the 2014 CDC protocol was close to level D (level of PPE is divided A to D and level D is the lowest protection), we modified the airway protection by upgrading the N95 mask (particulate filtering face-piece respirators) to a gas mask. We also modified the 2014 CDC leg cover process. Fig. 1 demonstrates the overall look of our study PPE. Table 1 shows the difference between the CDC guideline and study protocol.",

All processes were videotaped during PPE donning and doffing. Afterward, a trained examiner reviewed all video recordings and coded timer intervals and errors. Time stamps were determined according to a 2014 CDC protocol. Each procedure was initiated when the participant picked up the equipment. The procedure ended when the next procedure was initiated. Errors were determined when the participants violated the order of procedures even with the help of their partners. For example, if a participant skipped putting on a second glove and proceeded to the next procedure, this was counted as an error. Errors during the process were explained by partners and instructors, so participants could resume the normal process.",
