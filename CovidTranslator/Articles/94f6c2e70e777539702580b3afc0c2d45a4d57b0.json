However, elucidation of these complex roles requires targeted characterization of microbial communities present in relevant spatial niche(s) during critical periods of pathogenesis. The focus of this study is the respiratory tract, in particular the nasopharynx (NP), which is an accessible source of airway microbial communities (Hilty et al., 2010) and serves as a conduit for pathogens associated with lower respiratory illnesses (LRIs) that are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide.",

It is now recognized that the hallmark persistent wheeze of asthma is consolidated in childhood and, further, may progress to chronic asthma in adulthood Sly et al., 2008) and potentially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Tai et al., 2014) . We and others have previously shown that development of persistent atopic (allergic) wheeze in children is linked to the number of virus-associated febrile and/or wheezy LRIs experienced during infancy (Jackson et al., 2008; Kusel et al., 2007 Kusel et al., , 2012 Oddy et al., 2002) . The principal virus type of current interest is human rhinoviruses (HRVs), particularly subtype C (HRV-C) (Bochkov and Gern, 2012) ; however, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is also recognized as a major cause of infant LRI (Wu and Hartert, 2011) . The relative contributions of these viral pathogens in asthma initiation remain controversial (Stein and Martinez, 2010) . Further complicating the picture, recent studies have also implicated bacterial pathogens as potential independent causal factors in infant LRIs and their long-term sequelae. Notably, culture of S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, or H. influenzae from NP samples taken at 1 month of age has been linked to increased risk for subsequent diagnosis of asthma at 5 years of age (Bisgaard et al., 2007) . These findings have fuelled debate around the use of antibiotics and vaccine strategies for respiratory illness in children (Penders et al., 2011; Rollins et al., 2010) .",

Despite the inclusion of diverse OTUs of these genera in the reference database, our sequences were dominated by one OTU per genus ( Figure S1 ), consistent with culture-based studies reporting NP colonization with the species Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Alloiococcus otitidis. Hierarchical clustering of NP microbiomes based on relative abundance of the six major genera identified six microbiome profile groups (MPGs, Figure 1B ). Each MPG was dominated by one of the six genera, although some samples in the Alloiococcus MPG also had relatively high abundance of Corynebacterium ( Figure 1B ).",

In contrast, the prevalence of Alloiococcus and Moraxella MPGs in healthy samples increased with age (14% and 9% at 2 months, 26% and 41% at 12 months, respectively). Analysis of MPG transitions among consecutive healthy NP samples from the same individuals (Figures S3A and S3B) suggested that Staphylococcus carriage was unstable or transient, particularly where an ARI had occurred in the intervening period between sampling. Alloiococcus was a stable colonizer, but less so if an ARI occurred between sampling. Where an ARI occurred in the intervening period between healthy samples, the most common transitions were to the Moraxella MPG from other MPGs or the maintenance of stable colonization with Moraxella ( Figure S3B ). Almost all Moraxella-colonized infants experienced subsequent ARI before the next healthy sample was taken (explored further below). Haemophilus was very rarely detected in healthy NP microbiomes, while Streptococcus was present in 14% of healthy samples at each sampling time ( Figure 1C ). Similar age-related patterns were observed among infection samples, with a decline in Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium MPGs and increase in Moraxella, Haemophilus, and Streptococcus MPGs in older children (Figure 1D) . Interestingly, males had significantly more Moraxella in healthy samples (OR 1.3 for log abundance; 95% CI 1.1-1.5, p = 0.0014, adjusted for age); no other gender effects were detected.",

Children attending day care had significantly higher relative abundances of Haemophilus and Moraxella and lower relative abundances of Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus (Figure 2A) in both healthy and infection samples (note that very few children had commenced day care by 6 months of age, hence the impact of day care attendance was assessed at the 12-month time point only). Co-habiting with siblings was also associated with higher abundances of Haemophilus, Streptococcus, and Moraxella and lower abundance of Staphylococcus during health and ARI (adjusted for age at sampling, Figure 2B ). Importantly, among healthy samples, antibiotic usage in the four weeks prior to sampling was associated with higher abundances of Haemophilus, Streptococcus, and Moraxella and lower abundances of Alloiococcus and Corynebacterium (adjusted for age at sampling, Figure 2C ). The composition of the healthy NP microbiome was also affected by the number of prior respiratory infections experienced, with higher abundance of Moraxella and lower abundances of Alloiococcus or Corynebacterium in samples following increasing numbers of ARIs ( Figure 2E) . At the MPG level, ARIs dominated by Haemophilus increased in spring-summer, while those dominated by Moraxella peaked in autumn-winter ( Figure 2F ). We therefore tested for differences in relative abundance in autumn-winter and spring-summer, adjusting for age and number of prior infections; this confirmed significant seasonal effects on the abundance of Haemophilus (summer associated) and Moraxella (winter associated) among ARI samples and a similar but non-significant trend among healthy NP samples ( Figure 2D ).",

The Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Alloiococcus MPGs were significantly less frequent in ARI ( Figure 1E ). The rare genus Neisseria was more common in infection samples, especially LRIs (of 28 NP samples with > 5% relative abundance of Neisseria, 4 were from URI and 20 were from LRI, though all were co-colonized with Streptococcus). It was not possible to confirm species from the 16S sequences; however, it is well known that the respiratory pathogens S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and N. meningitidis are frequently cultured from respiratory infections in children. We have previously measured IgG to species-specific surface proteins of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae at 12 months of age in the CAS cohort (Hales et al., 2012) . Here we found that H. influenzae-specific IgG was significantly associated with the number of prior ARI samples testing positive for either of the two most common Haemophilus OTUs (Figures S2A-S2C); similar results were obtained for S. pneumoniae-specific IgG antibodies and the dominant Streptococcus OTU ( Figures  S2D-S2F ). Healthy colonization with these genera was not associated with species-specific IgG.",

All samples analyzed here were previously screened for a panel of viruses (Kusel et al., 2006) . This screen detected viruses in 21% of healthy samples, 68% of URIs, and 69% of LRIs. The most common viruses detected were RSV (11% of ARI) and HRV (40% of ARI) ( Figure S4 ), although subsequent expanded screening and subtyping of HRV in LRI samples suggests this is an underestimate (see below). For all virus groups except adenovirus and coronavirus, virus detection was significantly positively associated with ARI symptoms (i.e., ARI versus healthy samples, Figure S4 ). The association between ARI and Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Moraxella MPGs remained after adjusting for detection of virus (OR 7.0, p < 1 3 10 \u00c015 for any of these MPGs; individual ORs in Figure 1E ), indicating both viruses and bacteria contribute to ARI symptoms. Among the viruses analyzed, only RSV was significantly more frequent in LRIs versus URIs (16% versus 8.3%, OR 2.3; Figure S4 , Table 1 ). The illness-associated MPGs Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Moraxella were significantly associated with LRIs versus URIs (OR > 2), individually and collectively, adjusting for the effect of RSV (Table 1) . As a group, the illness-associated MPGs increased in frequency from healthy to URI to LRI samples, regardless of the presence of RSV ( Figure S5 ). Taken together, these analyses indicate that both viruses and bacteria independently contribute to ARI and that bacteria and RSV independently increase the risk of infection spread to the lower airways.",

Thus we investigated the association of viruses and bacteria with the presence of fever and wheeze symptoms during LRI. To enable more accurate assessment of the role of HRV in this critical sample group, we performed an expanded screen for detection and subtyping of HRV within LRI samples (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This assay proved more sensitive than the first screen and detected HRV in 66% of LRI samples (twice that in the earlier screen), with equal amounts of HRV-A and HRV-C ( Figure S4 ). During LRI, the presence of any HRV, or HRV-C specifically, was negatively associated with fever ( Figure S4 ) and influenza (8 influenza-positive fever LRI events only, all with illness-associated MPGs, thus not considered further). Among LRIs, the illness-associated MPGs were associated with fever, even after adjusting for RSV, HRV, age, season, and gender (Table 1) . Interestingly, Moraxella MPG was also significantly positively associated with fever among RSV-positive LRIs (OR 9.2, 95% CI 1.1-73, p = 0.037; Figure S5 ), suggesting a possible interaction between Moraxella and RSV whereby their co-presence further enhances risk of fever. Overall, only 10 febrile LRIs (9.5%) could not be explained by the presence of RSV or illness-associated MPGs. Across the cohort, the presence of wheeze during LRI was not significantly associated with any viral or bacterial groups (Table 1) , including HRV or HRV-C specifically. Of all ARIs analyzed, there were 61 with concomitant otitis media (OM) affecting 47 infants; however, ARIs with accompanying OM had similar NP microbiome profiles to those of LRIs with no OM diagnosis (Table S2) .",

Further, at the level of individual children, the frequency of chronic wheeze at 5 years was elevated among those with either one of febrile LRI (36%) or wheezy HRV-C LRI (30%) but was greatest among children who experienced both (58%, Figure 3D ).",

Using Cox proportional hazards models, infants whose earliest healthy NP sample was of the Moraxella or Streptococcus MPG tended to experience ARI at a younger age than those with other MPGs ( Figure 4B ; note that Haemophilus MPGs were extremely rare in early healthy samples). When examining URIs and LRIs separately, we found that early Moraxella colonization was associated with earlier first URI, whereas early Streptococcus colonization was strongly associated with earlier first LRI (Figures 4C and  4D ).

High Streptococcus abundance in the first pre-ARI healthy NP sample was more frequent in infants who later displayed wheeze at 5 years, and this association was stronger when restricting the analysis to earlier NP samples ( Figure 5B , Table 2 ). The same trend was evident for wheeze at 10 years of age, despite reduced sample size due to loss to follow-up (Table 2) .

            "text": "Our data provide a detailed prospective characterization of bacterial communities within the human NP microbiome during the first year of life. The NP microbiome was qualitatively simple (Figure 1) , dominated by six common genera: Haemophilus, Streptococcus, Moraxella (each more common in ARI), Staphylococcus, Alloiococcus, and Corynebacterium (more common in healthy samples). This is consistent with previous studies of NP microbiome composition in children aged 12-14 months (Biesbroek et al., 2014; Bogaert et al., 2011) and adults (Hilty et al., 2010) , although intra-and inter-sample diversity was greater in these older groups, likely due in part to extreme seasonal variation in those study locations. In contrast, our study site in Perth, Australia has a very moderate climate, and we detected only limited seasonal effects ( Figure 2D ) that were readily adjusted for, enabling us to assess the dynamics of the NP microbiome at different stages of infancy and to examine its association with other factors. We found that early NP colonization typically involved Staphylococcus or Corynebacterium, which was later replaced by Moraxella or Alloiococcus. Staphylococcus was the dominant colonizing bacteria in the early healthy NP microbiomes, but its presence declined rapidly with age ( Figure 1 ). S. aureus is a common cause of neonatal sepsis, and high rates of S. aureus nasal colonization in the first months of life have been reported (Bisgaard et al., 2007 (Bisgaard et al., , 2010 . Few studies have examined longitudinal colonization; however, a recent study in African children reported S. aureus colonization in 42% of infants at 1 month and 12% at 12 months of age, a trend that was mirrored in maternal colonization rates (Schaumburg et al., 2014) and is strikingly similar to the patterns we observed (41% at 2 months, 11% at 12 months). Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium are both common components of the human skin microbiome, and in our data they showed a comparable temporal pattern, with high rates in the early NP microbiome declining with age (Figure 1) . We speculate that infants tend to be colonized initially with skin-dwelling bacteria (acquired from parents and others), which is replaced over time by stable colonization with Moraxella or Alloiococcus and punctuated by transient acquisition of Streptococcus or Haemophilus that is frequently accompanied by ARI symptoms. Our data further suggest the transition to Moraxella is associated with exposure to other children (in the home or at day care) and episodes of ARI, and that colonization with Moraxella, Streptococcus, and Haemophilus are selected for by antibiotic exposure (Figure 2) . Moraxella was the most common genus in our study population, dominating 21% of all healthy NP microbiomes and 38% of infection samples. Moraxella was represented in our sequence data by a single OTU matching that of M. catarrhalis, a human-restricted, unencapsulated, Gram-negative bacterium previously associated with both commensal NP colonization and pathogenicity in the respiratory tract and inner ear (de Vries et al., 2009) . Increased rates of NP colonization with M. catarrhalis have been reported in children following pneumococcal vaccination (Revai et al., 2006) ; however, the samples in our study predate introduction of this vaccine. In our cohort the presence of Moraxella increased with age, and Moraxella was a particularly stable component of the NP microbiome during both health and disease ( Figure S3 ). These findings are consistent with Moraxella's known ability to form biofilms (de Vries et al., 2009) , which offer protection from antibiotics and promote co-colonization with other common bacteria such as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae (Verhaegh et al., 2011) . Moraxella was more abundant during the cooler months (Figure 2) , a seasonal trend consistent with recent reports that cold shock at 26 C stimulates growth, colonization, and expression of virulence-associated traits in M. cattarhalis (Spaniol et al., 2011) . These data are consistent with a Dutch culture-based study of M. catarrhalis carriage in young children (Verhaegh et al., 2011) , which found increasing prevalence of M. catarrhalis during the first year of life, with a strong seasonal effect (also observed in a Swedish cohort [Gisselsson-Sol\u00e9 n et al., 2014] ) and a significant positive association with day care attendance and siblings. However, these studies did not examine the stability of Moraxella colonization within individuals over time. Importantly, our data show that the presence of Moraxella contributes to severity of RSV respiratory infections in infants (Figure S5 , Table S3 ), which may be mechanistically related to RSV-Moraxella interactions reported in OM pathogenesis (Brockson et al., 2012) . Alloiococcus was a common and stable component of healthy NP samples and demonstrated enhanced stability in healthy NP microbiomes ( Figure S3 ). Alloiococcus is a Gram-positive bacterium with one named species, A. otitidis, frequently detected in the ear canals of children with OM. Little is known about its mechanisms of colonization; however, the stable colonization patterns we observed may reflect a propensity to form stable biofilms, similar to Moraxella. The Alloiococcus MPG included some samples with high abundances of both Alloiococcus and Corynebacterium, indicating compatibility between these bacteria somewhat reminiscent of that between the Moraxella biofilm and Streptococcus or Haemophilus. Whether Alloiococcus is involved in OM pathology or is merely a healthy component of the microbiome is controversial (Tano et al., 2008) ; in our data, Alloiococcus was not associated with ARI or OM (Figure 1, Table S2 ). (B) Adjusted odds ratio (OR, squares) and 95% confidence intervals (bars) for association between chronic wheeze at age 5 and high (> 20%) abundance of Streptococcus in the first healthy NP sample; p values and sample sizes (n) are indicated; individuals who experienced an infection prior to first healthy NP sample collection were excluded.",

In both these study populations, the susceptible subgroup of children were those who developed early allergic sensitization (Gern, 2009; Holt et al., 2010 Holt et al., , 2014 Jackson et al., 2008; Kusel et al., 2007 Kusel et al., , 2012 Oddy et al., 2002) , and a variety of evidence suggests that the underlying mechanism involves synergistic interactions between atopic and anti-viral inflammatory pathways triggered within the infected airway mucosa . Of note, ARIs that remain restricted to the upper respiratory tract, and infections resulting in only mild LRI without wheezing or febrile symptoms, are relatively benign with respect to asthma risk in this cohort (Holt et al., 2010; Kusel et al., 2007 Kusel et al., , 2012 ( Table S3 ).

Febrile LRI was common, occurring in one-third of all children and half of atopic chronic wheezers at age 5 ( Figure 3 and Figure 5) . Notably, the presence of illness-associated bacteria within the NP microbiome at the time of ARI increased both the risk for progression to the lower respiratory tract and the development of fever (Table 1) . These mechanisms likely include myriad bacterial-viral interactions (recently reviewed by Vissers et al., 2014) . In contrast, neither specific virus groups nor bacterial MPGs were associated with wheezy versus non-wheezy LRI within the overall population (Table 1) , and the impact of wheezy LRI on later chronic wheeze was limited to LRI with HRV-C (Table 2) , which occurred in just 11% of children. Re-examination of wheeze symptoms during LRI stratified by atopic status identified a positive association between HRV-C and wheeze during LRI among those children who later became sensitized (by 2 years of age), consistent with observations that HRV-C can induce wheeze in high-risk individuals (Lee et al., 2012) . However, the presence of wheezy LRI alone, without further stratification by HRV-C detection and later atopic status, was not a significant predictor of later chronic wheeze, while febrile LRI per se was a significant predictor of chronic wheeze at 5 and 10 years, both among atopics and across the whole cohort ( Figure 5 , Table 2 ).",

Early Streptococcus colonization was not associated with incidence of infections with Streptococcus MPG, nor with detection of S. pneumoniae-specific antibodies at 12 months, suggesting that the mechanism is independent of innate immune response to Streptococcus. Rather, early Streptococcus colonization was associated with younger age of first LRI, and the level of subsequent asthma risk appears inversely related to age at initial Streptococcus colonization (Figure 4 and Figure 5 ).

In that study, associations were not reported individually for the three species and colonization was measured as positive or negative by microbiological culture. In our cohort, wheeze at 5 years was not associated with early colonization with Haemophilus or Moraxella; however, Haemophilus was very rare in healthy NP samples, and Moraxella colonization was established later during infancy, which may be related to the warmer climate in Perth; these associations may differ in populations where asymptomatic carriage of these organisms is higher.",

            "text": "These findings collectively suggest that bacterial pathogens present in the NP microbiome at the time of upper respiratory viral infections during infancy are significant determinants of risk for the spread of infection to the lower airways and for the resultant expression of inflammatory symptoms marked by fever, and further, they may contribute directly and indirectly to the ensuing risk for development of persistent asthma, which itself is linked to these prior infectious episodes. Prevention of RSV or HRV infections in high-risk children, using immunoprophylaxis or vaccines, has been proposed as a mechanism for preventing the development and/or exacerbation of childhood asthma (Gern, 2009; Wu and Hartert, 2011) . Our data suggest that in the absence of effective anti-viral therapies, targeting pathogenic bacteria present within the NP microbiome in this age group could represent an alternative approach toward the same goal. The pneumococcal vaccine, currently recommended from 2 months of age, could play a role; however, the niche created by eliminating vaccinetargeted S. pneumoniae serotypes can be readily filled by other serotypes and other bacteria such as H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis (Biesbroek et al., 2014; Revai et al., 2006) . Manipulation of the microbiome by antibiotics may appear attractive; however, the association between antibiotic use in early childhood and subsequent asthma is controversial. In the CAS cohort (Kusel et al., 2008) and others (Semic-Jusufagic et al., 2014) , this association has been proposed to arise through confounding and reverse causation, whereby genetic or clinical factors increase the likelihood of both antibiotic prescription (e.g., via genetic susceptibility to viral infection [Semic-Jusufagic et al., 2014] ) and asthma development; others have proposed that antibiotic-induced disruption of the gut microbiota could explain the link (Arrieta and Finlay, 2014) . Our analyses provide a potential causal pathway linking antibiotics to later asthma, whereby antibiotic use in infants selects for illness-associated bacteria in the NP microbiome, leading to increased risk of febrile LRI and later asthma development. Genetic analysis of the infants in our cohort could potentially help to unravel this in the future. Importantly, further studies are required to prospectively assess the impact of antibiotic use on NP bacterial colonization during health and infection, and the subsequent development of ARI, atopy, and wheeze.",

Briefly, healthy NP aspirates (NPAs) were collected from subjects at planned visits at 2, 6, and 12 months of age. NPAs were also collected within 48 hr from the onset of an ARI; these were classified as either lower respiratory infection (LRI, if wheeze or rattly chest detected) or upper respiratory infection (URI, otherwise). NPAs were divided into four aliquots and stored at \u00c080 C. One aliquot was used for bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing via Illumina MiSeq and another to screen for viruses including RSV, HRV, and other picornaviruses, influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). For LRI, a third aliquot was used in an expanded screen for detection and subtyping of HRV. Study ethics were approved by the ethics committees of King Edward Memorial and Princess Margaret Hospitals in Western Australia. Fully informed parental consent was obtained for all subjects. Details of sample and data collection, viral screening, DNA extraction, and sequencing are in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.",

These were assigned to OTUs using the closed reference method in QIIME v1.8 (Caporaso et al., 2010) with the Greengenes 99% OTU reference set, version 13_5 (McDonald et al., 2012) (which consists of > 200,000 representative sequences obtained from clustering all sequences from the Greengenes reference database at 99% sequence similarity). Briefly, this method uses UCLUST (Edgar, 2010) to search each sequence against the reference set and assigns it to an OTU based on the best hit at R 99% sequence identity. Sequences not matching the reference database (3%) were excluded from analysis; these sequences could be chimeras, sequencing errors, or novel sequences that are not well characterized in the database. This left > 200,000 taxonomyassigned sequences on average for each NPA (interquartile range: 108,000-255,000; eight samples with < 1,000 reads).
