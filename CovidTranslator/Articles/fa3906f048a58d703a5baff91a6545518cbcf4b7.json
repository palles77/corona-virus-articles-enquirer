Clearly, if and when such changes are identified, candidate viruses possessing novel potential pandemic traits would be sent to vaccine laboratories for further development, prior to their appearance in nature. Because it is unlikely that such traits would be unique, and because the natural appearance of any particular trait is unpredictable, a stable of multiple potentially pandemic virus lineages, and artificial hybrids thereof, could enter the vaccine development laboratories, multiplying the opportunities for novel GoF viruses to escape. This emphasizes rather than diminishes the implications of the 1977 H1N1 escape, since the 1949-1950 H1N1 virus progenitor of the 1977 virus was likely in vaccine development preemptively because of the unrealized 1976 threat of a swine flu pandemic.",
