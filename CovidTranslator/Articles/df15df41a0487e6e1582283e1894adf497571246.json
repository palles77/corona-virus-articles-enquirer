            "text": "One of the most important topics that occupy public health problems is the air quality. That is the reason why mechanical ventilation and air handling units (AHU) were imposed by the different governments in the collective or individual buildings. Many buildings create an artificial climate using heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems. Among the existing aerosols in the indoor air, we can distinguish the bioaerosol with biological nature such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Respiratory viral infections are a major public health issue because they are usually highly infective. We spend about 90% of our time in closed environments such as homes, workplaces, or transport. Some studies have shown that AHU contribute to the spread and transport of viral particles within buildings. The aim of this work is to study the characterization of viral bioaerosols in indoor environments and to understand the fate of mengovirus eukaryote RNA virus on glass fiber filter F7 used in AHU. In this study, a set-up close to reality of AHU system was used. The mengovirus aerosolized was characterized and measured with the electrical low pressure impact and the scanner mobility particle size and detected with RT-qPCR. The results about quantification and the level of infectivity of mengovirus on the filter and in the biosampler showed that mengovirus can pass through the filter and remain infectious upstream and downstream the system. Regarding the virus infectivity on the filter under a constant air flow, mengovirus was remained infectious during 10 h after aerosolization.",

These systems manage and deliver fresh air with a well-controlled temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) and a reduction in the concentration of particles from the outside air (Sepp\u00e4nen and Fisk 2004) . Good maintenance of air handling units (AHUs) leads to health benefits and better productivity. Some individualized biological elements like spores, bacterial cells, and viruses are present in the indoor air and included in the term ''bioaerosol'' (Douwes et al. 2003) . Particles can be classified on a scale of 0.005-100 lm. Closed environments are 5-10 times more polluted than outside (Jones 1999) . A few studies have provided the number of hours that people spend in closed environments like offices, homes, shops, and gyms. In 2014, Export Enterprises SA published the number of hours spent indoors per day in different countries in the world. They estimated an average of 8.12 h per day, equivalent to 34% of the day (Export Enterprises SA 2014). According to neuroscience research, people sleep for 29-33% of their day (Aritake et al. 2004; Siegel 2003) while another sociological study revealed that people spend 14% of their day at home (Turcotte 2005) .",

Most of them are easily transmitted by direct contact, droplets, or aerosolization. These infections can evolve from an ordinary viral infection to an outbreak (Tellier 2006) . All particles smaller than 30 lm in size can invade a room very rapidly (Morawska 2006) . It is estimated that 7 mg of particles less than 2 lm in size can be emitted by coughing (Zhu et al. 2006) . The study of Fabian et al. (2011) demonstrated that a person infected with influenza can exhale 3-20 influenza viruses per min with just normal breathing. Another study of Coxsackie virus explained that 160 viral particles are emitted during sneezing and coughing (Couch et al. 1966; Downie et al. 1965 ). On average, 480 L of air are breathed by an adult in 1 h (Hermann and Cier 1973) . The studies of Couch et al. (1966) and Downie et al. (1965) observed that infected people can generate 0.1-10 viruses L -1 h -1 and proved that two infected people simply breathing (without coughing or sneezing) and occupying an office of 40 m 3 for 4 h can contaminate indoor air with 0.24 virus L -1 m -3 (with no renewal of air).",

Some studies have shown that ventilation systems and AHUs spread and transport viral particles inside buildings (Ezratty and Squinazi 2008; Fabian et al. 2008; Tang et al. 2006) . In a meta-analysis, 22 studies out of 40 proved the direct contribution of ventilation and airflow to spreading indoor infectious airborne viruses in office buildings during the SARS outbreak and other viral outbreaks (Li et al. 2007) . Some recent studies have detected airborne bacteria and some specific viruses on HVAC filters in a daycare center (Prussin et al. 2016 ) and large public buildings (Goyal et al. 2011) . Myatt et al. (2004) analyzed 181 filters of AHUs used for 47 h and showed that 58 filters were contaminated with 59% picornavirus, 24% corona virus, and 17% parainfluenza virus. The temperature and the relative humidity (% RH) in the AHU can have an effect on the persistence of viral particles; as temperature and humidity decreases, the persistence of influenza viruses increases. For example, with a temperature of 20-25\u00b0C and 20% RH, the persistence of the influenza virus is higher than at 50% RH. The persistence decreases when humidity increases to 80% (Harper 1961; Lowen et al. 2007; Schaffer et al. 1976 ). The mengovirus exhibits rapid inactivation at RH between 40 and 60% (Songer 1967) .",

This filter is made of fiberglass felt with a developed surface area of 3500 \u00b1 500 cm 2 . The F7 is a highly ventilated multi-layered medium. The filtration velocity is 0.2 m s -1 and the median fiber diameter is 1 \u00b1 0.2 lm. In this study, a circular filter of 17.72 cm 2 was used in each output (Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2016) . The experimental design consists of a vertical column made of polymethyl methacrylate where the viruses will be generated and homogenized in the upward air flow. This generation is carried out by the medical nebulizer (Omron C29-CompAir Pro, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands) which ensures an air flow of 4.5 L min -1 supplied by compressed air. At the end of the cylinder, four circular outputs of Food Environ Virol (2017) 9:464-472 465 diameter 4 cm, which accommodate the filters, are arranged perpendicular to the flow. Three of the four outputs are equipped with the filter to be studied. Downstream of the filters, the BioSampler (SKC Inc., Pennsylvania, USA) samples the particles passing through the filters. The sampling rate is 13 L min -1 at the entry of each BioSampler (SKC Inc., Pennsylvania, USA). Two volumetric pumps are set downstream of the device to ensure the flow of air treated through the filters. The frontal filtration velocity at each filter is 0.16 m s -1 and is representative of the velocity observable in the AHUs on a pleated F7 filter. The device is positioned under a laminar flow hood with clean and sterile air.",

This validation was carried out in triplicate.

The average quantification of 4 experiments showed that from 6.68 9 10 7 GU L -1 air of mengovirus aerosolized for 25 min, 9.20 9 10 6 GU cm -2 was collected on three filters and 1.19 9 10 6 GU of mengovirus per liter of air passed through the filters.

The experimental set-up used in this study represents a model of the real-life functioning of an air handling unit. The pilot was validated using fluorescein and then confirmed with mengovirus showing an efficiency between 78.8 and 81%. The loss observed in the pilot validation is due to viruses that are retained on the walls of the pipes and the column (difficult to extract), the efficiency of the BioSampler collector (78%) and of the filter extraction (74%). The filter used in this study (F7-CompAir) is commonly used in AHUs and shows the same filtration speeds (0.16 m s -1 ) and an effectiveness of between 83.8 and 98.5%. This calculated effectiveness was confirmed in the study of Bailly (2001) on the efficiency of the air filter resulting from curves of the four filtration phenomena. The dynamics and characteristics of bioaerosols are an important topic. The size of mengovirus was determined by the study of Faulkner et al. (1961) as 27 nm. In this study, some hypotheses can be made: The nebulized mengovirus cannot be aerosolized as a single virus as no virus was detected on the ELPI TM stage with the specific size of the virus. The aerosol could be constituted of groups of viruses (more than 3 viruses). The virus could be associated with proteins or debris cells present in the centrifuged medium. This can be confirmed in real life as infectious respiratory viruses are expelled with cell debris and mucus.",

            "text": "Based on the quantification and detection of infectivity in the system by RT-qPCR and TCID 50 measurement, the study shows that viruses stopped by the filter and those that passed through the filters remained infectious. This loss of infectivity confirms the study of Songer (1967) who showed the rapid inactivation of the mengovirus due to the RH% between 40 and 60% measured in this study during the 25 min of aerosolization. Goyal et al. (2011) did not detect any infectious virus in used ventilation filters from two large public buildings but they were able to detect viruses by PCR. Farnsworth et al. (2006) showed the difficulty of detecting the persistence of viruses in AHUs since most viruses present on AHU filters are deactivated within a day. The study of Vasickova et al. (2010) focused on the inactivation rate of viruses on different supports. The review of Gerba (2013) revealed different inactivations between viruses. They pointed out differences in inactivation between enveloped and nonenveloped respiratory viruses. For example, they found that the inactivation rate was 0.25 log 10 . h -1 for rhinovirus and 0.625 log 10 h -1 for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). They concluded that non-enveloped respiratory viruses can survive longer than enveloped viruses. This shows the importance of using mengovirus in this study, which is a model of non-enveloped rhinoviruses. The WHO review about the potential transmission of Avian Influenza (H5N1) through Water and Sewage (2017b) reports that, in general, virus half-lives are of the order of hours. The literature states that the virus support, for example, here the filter samples, can play a role in reducing infectivity. The WHO report on the stability and resistance of the SARS coronavirus (2017a) indicates that the persistence of this virus on wood and cotton cloth is only 12 h. Other studies like Sizun et al. (2000) have proved that human coronavirus can persist for only 3-6 h on sterile sponges while the study of Hall et al. (1980) pointed out that RSV can persist for 2.5 h on cloth gowns and 1 h on paper towels.",
