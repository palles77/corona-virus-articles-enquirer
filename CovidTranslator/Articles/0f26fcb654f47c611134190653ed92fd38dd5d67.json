The safety and stability of recombinant Salmonella vaccine were evaluated. Following oral and nasal administration to chickens, the serum and mucosal samples were collected and antibodies against IBV were measured. Chickens were then challenged with IBV strain M41 by the nasal-ocular route 3 weeks after boosting. The results showed that oral and nasal immunization with coadministered SL/pV-S1 and SL/pV-N elicited significant IBV-specific humoral and mucosal immune responses and conferred protective efficacy against IBV challenge higher than that in chickens immunized only with SL/pV-S1. The current study shows that novel DNA vaccines delivered by attenuated S. Typhimurium may be promising candidates for the prevention of infectious bronchitis (IB).These vaccines are efficacious, easily produced economically, and able to be delivered orally and nasally rather than injected. Coadministration of SL/pV-S1 and SL/pV-N may represent an effective mucosal vaccination regimen.",

Of these, S1 glycoprotein and N protein can elicit protective immune responses in chickens. S1 glycoprotein is reported to attach to the host cell membrane and induce neutralizing and hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies (2, 5, 14) . N protein is the most abundant virus-derived protein produced throughout infection and is conserved across various IBV strains. This protein is also highly immunogenic and carries epitopes that induce cross-reactive antibodies (26) . Furthermore, N protein may act as a relevant target for immune recognition in both mice and chickens (1, 27, 40, 41) .",

Studies showed that vaccination with IBV DNA vaccines is able to induce protective immune responses in some cases (1, 10, 29, 41) . Compared to traditional vaccines, DNA vaccines for avian species offer many advantages. DNA vaccines may be useful in immunizing avian chicks by overcoming the limitations of an immature immune system and produce minimal interference from passive maternal antibodies (24, 28) . DNA vaccination requires the injection of naked DNA, which is not suitable for vaccinating large numbers of commercial chickens. To overcome this limitation, an attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain has been used as a DNA vaccine delivery system in multiple studies, whereby recombinant antigens of pathogens are delivered orally or na-sally to induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses (23, 25) . The aim of the present study was to develop DNA vaccines carrying the S1 and N genes of IBV to be delivered by the attenuated S. Typhimurium strains SL/pV-S1 and SL/ pV-N. The immune responses and protective efficacy of oral and nasal immunization with SL/pV-S1 and the coadministration of SL/pV-S1 and SL/pV-N were also evaluated to provide information about DNA vaccines against IBV in chickens.",

Recently, several studies have shown that DNA vaccines can elicit protective immune responses against IBV (1, 14, 18, 42) , with the intramuscular route of injection being the most common route of DNA vaccination in avian species. However, the cost constraints involved with livestock production and the need for mass immunization have limited the application of DNA vaccines to the commercial poultry industry. Such limitations may be overcome by using attenuated Salmonella as a carrier of DNA vaccines. It has been reported that attenuated Salmonella has been used most extensively to deliver orally or nasally target antigens to the mucosal and systemic immune system (21) . Salmonella-based vaccines are stable, convenient, and relatively inexpensive to produce. Currently, Salmonella-based DNA vaccines have been used to express foreign antigens in animals and to induce protective efficacy against a variety of pathogens, especially those invading via the respiratory or genital tract (16, 19, 23, 25) . Therefore, we have constructed recombinant Salmonella vaccine strains against IBV and evaluated their immune efficacy.",

A lower percentage of challenge virus was isolated from the SL/pV-S1 group, the coadministered SL/ pV-S1 and SL/pV-N group, and the H120 group than from the control and SL/pV groups. The eradication of challenge virus in the group coadministered SL/pV-S1 and SL/pV-N was earlier than that in the SL/pV-S1 group. By day 10, the challenge virus was almost fully cleared from the group coadministered SL/pV-S1 and SL/pV-N and the H120 group and was partly cleared from the SL/pV-S1 group. The protection levels obtained with an oral vaccine in our study were very similar to the values obtained with vaccines administrated by parenteral routes (38) .
