Here, we expand our investigation of the immunogenic properties of these bivalent vaccines in mice. Both live and killed vaccines induced primary EBOV GP-specific T-cells and a robust recall response as measured by interferon-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay. In addition to cellular immunity, an effective filovirus vaccine will likely require a multivalent humoral immune response against multiple virus species. As a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrated that inactivated RV-GP could be formulated with another inactivated RABV vaccine expressing the nontoxic fragment of botulinum neurotoxin A heavy chain (HC50) without a reduction in immunity to each component. Finally, we demonstrated that humoral immunity to GP could be induced by immunization of mice with inactivated RV-GP in the presence of pre-existing immunity to RABV. The ability of these novel vaccines to induce strong humoral and cellular immunity indicates that they should be further evaluated in additional animal models of infection.",

The search for a multivalent filovirus vaccine that confers protection from the Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus species of public health concern continues as no candidate is approaching licensure [2, 3] . The high case fatality rate, public health threat in Africa, and biodefense concerns associated with these viruses drive vaccine development. Several vaccination strategies have been developed over the past decade that confer protection in animal models but issues of safety, preexisting vector immunity, manufacturing, or a lack of commercial interest have slowed progress [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] . Recent studies and literature reviews have attempted to determine correlates of protection for filovirus vaccines and to define the ability of humoral or cellular immunity to ameliorate disease [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Not surprisingly, it appears that both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune response can contribute to protection.",

The recombinant RABV vaccine vector (RVA) is derived from the SAD B19 strain which is used for wildlife vaccination in Europe and has previously been used as a safe and efficacious platform to generate vaccine candidates against several pathogens [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Two live vaccine candidates, RV-GP and RV\u0394G-GP, which has a deletion removing the entire RABV glycoprotein (G) gene, were found to be avirulent upon peripheral administration in mice. Based on the efficient incorporation of GP into the virion, an inactivated vaccine, INAC-RV-GP, was also produced by treatment with beta-propiolactone, the standard method utilized for the current human RABV vaccine. Each bivalent vaccine candidate induced strong humoral immunity to RABV G and EBOV GP, and conferred protection from both lethal RABV and mouse-adapted EBOV challenge in mice [13] . Our primary focus is the development of an inactivated vaccine for use in humans based on the potential for superior safety and the history of the successful existing RABV vaccine that is widely used in humans, but we are also pursuing the live attenuated vaccine candidates for use in nonhuman primate populations in Africa at risk for lethal EBOV infection [19, 20] .",

As indicated in Figure 3A , each vaccination approach induced strong antibody responses against RABV G as expected since RABV G was present in each immunogen. Either a single dose or two doses of INAC-RV-HC50 induced botulinum HC50-specific antibodies, and interestingly, combined administration with INAC-RV-GP resulted in a slightly stronger HC50-specific response ( Figure 3B ). Finally, analysis of the GP-specific antibody response indicated that single or boosted immunization with INAC-RV-GP induced strong immunity as expected ( Figure 3C ). Importantly, co-administration of INAC-RV-GP and INAC-RV-HC50 induced antibody levels that were nearly identical to INAC-RV-GP immunization.

            "text": "The contribution of T-cell mediated immunity to protection from EBOV challenge in mice and macaques has been recently reviewed and appears to vary among the vaccine candidates [11, 12] . The cellular immune response has been suggested to contribute to protection in mice for virus-like particle vaccines, but not for vesicular stomatitis virus based vaccines [29, 30] . Recently, protection in macaques mediated by adenovirus vectored GP was attributed to CD8 + T-cells by depletion prior to challenge [10] . However, some protective vaccines in macaques are not believed to induce strong cellular immunity [12] . Here, investigation of the T-cell response to the RVA-vectored GP vaccines was pursued for comparison to other candidates. Both live and killed vaccines induced primary T-cell mediated responses as measured by interferon-\u03b3 ELISPOT with the response to RV-GP being the most robust. As a means to study the memory recall response in the absence of a BSL-4 facility, we used a vaccinia virus expressing EBOV GP as a surrogate challenge virus. Again, each vaccine candidate induced high levels of recalled GP-specific T-cells upon challenge, and a two doses regime of INAC-RV-GP was found to induce T-cells on par with RV-GP. As inactivated vaccines are commonly believed to be weak inducers of Tcell immunity, these data were very encouraging; particularly, since we are focusing on INAC-RV-GP for human vaccine development. It is important to note that INAC-RV-GP is inactivated by the same method as the RABV vaccine currently used for humans and requires no adjuvant. These results indicate that both live and killed vaccines induce T cell responses indicating that each of our vaccination strategies induces a potent humoral and cell mediated immune response.",

For epidemiological and commercial considerations, an effective filovirus vaccine will likely require induction of multivalent immunity to Ebola virus (Zaire), Sudan Ebola virus, and Marburg virus. As cross-reactivity amongst the filoviruses is limited and not well-defined, vaccination with multiple immunogens is likely required and has been achieved with the DNA/adenovirus platform and the vesicular stomatitis virus platform [5, 31] . Here, as a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrated that co-administration of INAC-RV-GP with INAC-RV-HC50, an inactivated RABV vaccine which expresses a fragment of the botulinum neurotoxin, induced humoral immunity to RABV G, botulinum HC50, and EBOV GP that was comparable to single administration. Thus, the inactivated RABV vaccine platform appears to be well-suited for induction of multivalent immunity, and additional RABV vaccines expressing various filovirus GPs are being pursued.",

The ability to effectively immunize mice in the presence of RABV G-specific antibodies suggests that our vaccination strategy may be effective in previously RABV-vaccinated humans and that boosting with various RABV vectored vaccines may be successful. This finding is important as many laboratory workers, first responders, or soldiers who might receive EBOV vaccination may be previously immunized with RABV vaccine. Although pre-existing immunity to VSV vectored vaccines would presumably be low and not an issue, pre-existing immunity in the general population to adenovirus and paramyxovirus vectored vaccines has been raised as a potential concern [2] .",

Three critical parameters were demonstrated: induction of cell-mediated immunity, the ability to induce a multivalent humoral response, and the ability to immunize in the presence of vector immunity. Further definition of the immune response to these vaccine candidates will now shift to study in macaques. Should immunogenicity and efficacy studies in nonhuman primates result in positive outcomes, we believe that the RABV vaccine platform may be a superior strategy for filovirus vaccination based on consideration of safety, manufacturing, cost, and the ability to also confer protection from RABV which is still a major public health problem in Africa [32, 33] .",

A fourth group was immunized with 10 \u03bcg inactivated INAC-RV-HC50 on day 0 followed by 10 \u03bcg inactivated INAC-RV-GP on day 28. Four weeks after immunization, serum from each group was assayed by ELISA against (A) RABV G, (B) HC50, and (C) EBOV GP. As expected, each vaccination approach induced strong antibody responses against RABV G (Figure 4A) and vaccination with INAC-RV-HC50 or INAC-RV-HC50 followed by INAC-RV-GP induced potent HC50-specific antibodies (Figure 4B). Interestingly, vaccination with INAC-RV-HC50 followed by INAC-RV-GP induced similar levels of GP-specific antibodies to vaccination with INAC-GP alone (Figure 4C). These results indicate that immunization with INAC-RV-GP can induce GP-specific antibodies in the presence of pre-existing RABV immunity. The presence of a potent RABV G-specific antibody response at day 28 prior to immunization with INAC-RV-GP was confirmed (data not shown).",
