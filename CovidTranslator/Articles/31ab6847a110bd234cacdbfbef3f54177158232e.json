Methods: This was a nested case-control study. A questionnaire was distributed to the study cohort two weeks after the Hajj period and was self-administered by all recruited subjects. In addition, the medical records of study subjects were reviewed at Al-Hada Hospital for the same period in order to document ARI. Results: The attack rate for ARI among study subjects during Hajj season or within two weeks of returning was 25.6% (64/250). Logistic regression analysis of factors related to acquiring ARI revealed that contact with pilgrims imposed an extremely high risk of infection (adjusted OR 13.2, 95% CI 1.5-117.6). Moreover, non-use of alcohol-based hand disinfection carried a more than 8-fold risk of acquiring ARI compared to those who always used alcohol for hand disinfection (adjusted OR 8.4, 95% CI 2.2-32.2). Smoking was also a predictor of ARI in our cohort and influenza vaccination was associated with a 30% reduction in ARI compared to unvaccinated subjects, although this finding was not statistically significant. Unexpectedly, the logistic regression model showed that Saudi nationals were three times more likely to acquire ARI than non-Saudis (adjusted OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2-8.4). Conclusions: The common practice among pilgrims and medical personnel of using surgical facemasks to protect themselves against ARI should be discontinued and regular use of alcohol-based hand scrubs should be more vigorously encouraged. Further research is needed to evaluate the protective value of N95 facemasks against ARI during the Hajj period. #",

            "text": "Influenza virus is a common respiratory agent that often requires outpatient healthcare visits or hospitalization. Influenza rapidly spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics and imposes a considerable economic burden in the form of hospital and other healthcare costs and lost productivity. Recent studies have shown a high incidence of influenza infections during the Muslim Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. 1, 2 Hajj is the largest annual gathering of its kind in the world that brings over two million people together in a small, geographically-confined area. All adult Muslims who are physically and financially able to do so, have a religious obligation to make the pilgrimage once in their lifetime and over two million from around the world gather in Mecca each year. 3 Around 41 091 pilgrims from Europe attended the 2005 Hajj season. 4 Attack rates vary during outbreak cycles of influenza but have been reported as high as 20-40% during the peak period of activity. 5 Information regarding the magnitude of ARI during Hajj season is generally lacking, which hinders efforts for prevention and control. One study has reported a cumulative incidence of ARI of 40% among a group of pilgrims, coinciding with the above-mentioned attack rate for influenza during pandemics. 6 Although a number of non-immunization and non-pharmacologic interventions like personal hygiene, the wearing of facemasks, and screening and quarantine of travelers to slow international spread were tested during the emergency global response to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), their use during the differing conditions of an influenza pandemic has not been systematically evaluated. 7 This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of ARI among personnel serving in two Hajj mission hospitals in Saudi Arabia during the 2004 season, as well as to determine the effectiveness of protective measures against ARI.",

Saudi nationals represented 48.8% of the study subjects ( Table 1 ). The attack rate for ARI among members of the mission during Hajj season or within two weeks of returning was estimated as 25.6% (64/ 250). Table 2 and Figure 1 , show that 36.1% of Saudi mission members had ARI compared to 15.6% of non-Saudi staff, representing a 3-fold higher risk for Saudi nationals (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.6-5.8). Subjects over 45 years of age were 91% less likely to contract ARI compared to the youngest age group ( 30 years old) (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.4). There was a trend showing the overall risk of developing ARI decreasing with advancing age (x 2 for trend = 11.6, p = 0.001). Furthermore, smokers were found to have 2.5-fold greater risk of developing ARI compared to non-smokers (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.02-6.2). Direct contact with pilgrims during healthcare services carried an extremely high risk of acquiring ARI (OR 12.0, 95% CI 1.6-92.7). No statistically significant association was found between ARI and occupation or vaccination against influenza (either more than two weeks or less than two weeks or not immunized at all). Using facemasks intermittently carried more risk of acquiring ARI than using facemasks all the time (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4-5.0). Medical personnel who never used alcohol for hand disinfection developed ARI five times more often compared to those who practiced regular alcohol hand disinfection (OR 5.1, 95% CI 2.2-11.8). In addition, there was a statistically significant negative trend for alcohol use in hand disinfection. Alcohol use for hand disinfection was found to be protective against ARI comparing those who regularly used alcohol to those who used alcohol intermittently (with nearly double the risk), and to those who never used alcohol (with nearly five times the risk) (x 2 for trend = 19.1, p < 0.001).",

With the hope of potentially helping the Saudi government design a rational control program for ARI during the Hajj season, the present study examined possible risk and protective factors for ARI among Hajj medical mission personnel. We found the ARI attack rate (25.6%) among medical mission members in our Saudi hospitals within the range estimated by Conly and Johnston (20-40%) during influenza pandemics. 5 This figure is also consistent with the 39% incidence of ARI among pilgrims from Riyadh. 6 In another survey, 10.8% of 500 Hajj pilgrims presenting with upper respiratory tract symptoms had a positive viral throat culture. 1 Our finding that ARI were less frequent among older age groups is in contrast to the study by Khalid and coworkers. 6 A possible explanation for our results could be that the older age groups are usually higher-ranked officers or employees who are less involved in pilgrim care, while younger staff are more frequently in direct contact with pilgrims, and thus have greater exposure and risk of infection. Neither we nor Khalid and colleagues could determine an association between infection and gender. 6 Unlike the above-mentioned report of ARI among Hajj pilgrims from Riyadh, 6 in our study regular use of facemasks offered no significant protection against ARI. Our finding is in agreement, however, with the conclusion of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA which stated that surgical masks are not designed for use as particulate respirators and do not provide much protection against airborne diseases because they do not effectively filter small particles from the air or prevent leakage around the edge of the mask when the user inhales. 9 Furthermore, we found that intermittent use of surgical-type masks was actually associated with more than a 2.5-fold greater risk of infection. It is possible that once a facemask is worn in the presence of an infected patient, the mask could become contaminated with infectious material and touching the outside of the device could result in hand transmission of the infection to the respiratory tract during nose-rubbing. 9 We found cigarette smoking to be a strong predictor of ARI in our cohort, although previous reports regarding the association between smoking and respiratory infection, including influenza, have been conflicting. 6, 10 The use of alcohol-based hand rub as an effective infection control measure against ARI has been recommended by the World Health Association (WHO). 11 We noted a 5-fold greater risk of infection among those who never used alcohol-based hand disinfection compared to regular users.",
