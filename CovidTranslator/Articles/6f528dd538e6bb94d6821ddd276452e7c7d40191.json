The use of facial protective equipment (FPE) is an important strategy to prevent occupational transmission. Methods: A 2-phased study was conducted to examine nurse's adherence to recommended use of FPE. Phase 1 was a cross-sectional survey of nurses in selected units of 6 acute care hospitals in Toronto, Canada. Phase 2 was a direct observational study of critical care nurses. Results: Of the 1,074 nurses who completed surveys (82% response rate), 44% reported adherence to recommended use of FPE. Multivariable analysis revealed 6 predictors of adherence: unit type, frequency of equipment use, equipment availability, training, organizational support, and communication. Following the survey, 100 observations in 14 intensive care units were conducted that revealed a 44% competence rate with proper use of N95 respirators and knowledge as a significant predictor of competence.",

            "text": "With the recent decade of health threats from respiratory infections (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] , avian influenza, bioterrorism events, H1N1), there is heightened concern about occupational transmission of communicable respiratory illnesses in health care. Important primary prevention efforts include vaccination, hand hygiene, and use of personal protective equipment. Protection efforts are hindered by a lack of data on modes of transmission of respiratory pathogens such as influenza, on effectiveness of protection provided by different types of equipment, and on how to ensure adherence to safe work practices. 1 Adherence to personal protective equipment generally has been identified as a long-standing problem in the health sector, and most proposed solutions have either had minimal impact or been unsustainable. Adherence to personal protective equipment (such as gloves) to prevent the spread of bloodborne disease is an area that has been well studied. 2 Adherence to facial protective equipment (FPE) (respirators, surgical masks, eye/face protection) to prevent the spread of communicable respiratory illness has only recently become the focus of research. Studies have shown that adherence to FPE was the most problematic of all types of personal protective equipment in health care. [3] [4] [5] Recent survey-based studies of adherence used contextual models that examined the environment within which the person operates. 6 A revised version of the PRECEDE (Predisposing, Reinforcing and Enabling Constructs in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation) model, 7 Moore et al's theoretical framework 8 was used in a pilot study to examine nurse's adherence to recommended use of FPE and categorized factors influencing adherence as individual, environmental, and organizational. Results from the pilot study suggested that environmental and organizational factors were the most significant predictors of nurse's adherence. 9 We report the results of a larger and more comprehensive study of nurse's adherence to recommended use of FPE to identify determinants of adherence that can be used to implement interventions to improve adherence, reduce illness, and enhance the work and health of nurses.",

Although this relationship may have some inherent contributory bias, it may have implications for policy and practice. If organizations could designate a relatively limited number of staff to care for patients with communicable respiratory illness, this might result in better staff adherence to FPE. Other benefits of such cohorting could include the following: concentrating resources in 1 area, making it possible to designate certain equipment for use with patients and thereby reduce the risk of possible fomite transmission; facilitation of concentrated infection control activities; and the physical separation of patients from others in the hospital. 39 However, limiting the number of experienced workers could also be a problem if the regular cohort of workers were to be depleted through absences because of illness or redeployment. In addition, less experienced workers caring for patients mistakenly thought to be low risk might also result in an overall increase in transmission risk.",

Because competence was measured outside of the work environment, it makes sense that it would be influenced by an individual level factor such as knowledge. Measuring competence through worker demonstration eliminates the interaction between the worker and the work environment that is so critical when measuring adherence. Of interest, the organizational variable \"absence of job hindrances,\" although of borderline statistical significance, is quite a strong predictor of competence, with an odds ratio of 2.3.",

Self-selection bias was likely minimized by the high participation rate. Subject recall and social desirability bias may have been a problem given the reliance on self-report data but would have been mitigated through survey anonymity. Survey results were based on subjective data. Reliability testing for 3 of the explanatory measures fell below the acceptable range (<.70). Similar results were reported in the pilot study and are likely due to variables inherently representing multiple content domains (types of illness, modes of transmission, and types of equipment). Because of a low number of patients on respiratory precautions, adherence could not be evaluated in the observational study. Multivariable analysis of the predictors of competence found knowledge to be a significant predictor, but a wide confidence interval suggested that a larger sample size was needed.",

The most important determinants of adherence to recommended use of FPE were found to be the organizational characteristics of the workplace. As a follow-up to this study, intervention studies testing different strategies targeting these organizational dimensions are needed. Competence with recommended use of an N95 respirator for a patient on airborne precautions was examined in phase 2 of this study, and knowledge was found to be the primary determinant of competence. No relationship between self-reported adherence and observed competence was found in this study, but one could hypothesize that, whereas competence does not always lead to effective performance or adherence, it could be seen as one of its many determinants. Further research examining the relationship between competence and adherence would be valuable. This area of research is particularly important because studies of observed adherence to recommended use of FPE are logistically difficult in the acute health care sector. Finally, the examination of different methodologies for investigating adherence to FPE could be part of future research studies. Using the current methodology, we were unable to measure observed adherence but were able to measure competence. The future areas of research generated by this study provide exciting opportunities for researchers to advance the current body of knowledge on adherence to important infection control practices. It also provides opportunities to merge fields of study that have traditionally not been linked.",

Findings demonstrated that, despite the SARS experience and the resulting investment in worker protection, nurse's adherence to recommended use of FPE and competence with recommended use of an N95 respirator remains suboptimal. Whereas knowledge was found to predict competence, organizational factors and other safety climate dimensions were the primary determinants of adherence to recommended use of FPE. Interventions targeting these determinants should support the reduction of occupational transmission of communicable respiratory illness, better protect health care workers, and strengthen the workforce that is so critical to the success of our Canadian public health system.",
