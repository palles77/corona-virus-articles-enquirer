In addition to being regarded as an NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitor, apocynin (APO) exhibits an anti-apoptotic effect in various cells. The present study aimed to identify the protective role of apocynin in ER stress-mediated EC apoptosis and the underlying mechanisms. We found that ER stress resulted in a significant increase in c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation, and elicited caspase 3 cleavage and apoptosis. However, apocynin obviously attenuated EC apoptosis and this effect was partly dependent on ER stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1). Importantly, apocynin upregulated IRE1\u03b1 expression in both protein and mRNA levels and promoted the pro-survival XBP1 splicing. Our results suggest that apocynin protects ECs against ER stress-induced apoptosis via IRE1\u03b1 involvement. These findings may provide a novel mechanistic explanation for the anti-apoptotic effect of apocynin in ER stress.",

Perturbations of ER homeostasis lead to accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins, thus triggering ER stress. To restore the ER homeostasis, adaptive signaling cascade known as unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated. Among the three UPR branches, inositol-requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1) is the most sensitive arm. As we have reviewed previously [1] , IRE1\u03b1 functions as an intriguing cell fate switch. IRE1\u03b1 contains a kinase domain and an endoribonuclease (RNase) domain. The best characterized substrate for the RNase domain of IRE1\u03b1 is X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). Upon ER stress, XBP1 is spliced by IRE1\u03b1, thereby generating XBP1s, an active transcription factor encoding various adaptive genes. The IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 axis exerts adaptive and pro-survival effect, while other signaling pathways such as IRE1\u03b1-TRAF2-JNK axis evoke pro-apoptotic effect.",

Influenced by the elevation or reduction of blood nutrients, ECs are very metabolically active cells. With a high amount of protein synthesis, ECs are predisposed to ER stress [2] . Stressors such as hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia may cause ER stress. In response, the ECs initiate UPR to promote survival. However, in the case of unresolved and sustained ER stress, the UPR can result in EC apoptosis [3, 4] . Accumulating evidence showed that ER stress-induced EC apoptosis is implicated in a variety of human diseases, including diabetes [5] , atherosclerosis [6] , and neurodegeneration [7] . Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of ER stress-elicited EC apoptosis remain elusive. Thus, it is important to clarify the mechanisms and find potential therapeutic agents for these diseases.",

Moreover, the anti-apoptotic effect of apocynin was demonstrated in recent studies as well.

Until now, most of the studies have attributed the protective effect of apocynin to the inhibition of NOX activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.

            "text": "First, we wondered whether apocynin can alleviate ER stress-induced EC apoptosis. In order to induce ER stress in ECs, we applied thapsigargin (TG), a specific irreversible inhibitor of ER calcium-ATPase, for the following experiments. Given that JNK signaling pathway participates in ER stress-induced cell apoptosis [17] , we detected the phosphorylation levels of JNK. As revealed in Fig. 1a , TG application caused a significant increase in JNK phosphorylation, while apocynin pretreatment at the concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 mmol/L strongly mitigated this effect. This result reveals that apocynin may protect EC from ER stress-induced apoptosis. Then, to further investigate the anti-apoptotic role of apocynin, we evaluated the cleavage of caspase 3. We found that TG evoked a significant increase in cleaved caspase 3 expression (Fig. 1b) . Nevertheless, apocynin pretreatment diminished this effect robustly (Fig. 1b) . Subsequently, annexin V-FITC/PI staining was conducted to verify the anti-apoptotic role of apocynin. Consistent with the western blot results, TG induced an obvious increase in EC apoptosis, while apocynin significantly alleviated ER stress-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1c, d) . Hence, these data clearly highlight the anti-apoptotic role of apocynin in ER stress-mediated EC apoptosis.",

As revealed in Fig. 2c , d, in comparison to Control siRNA+APO+TG group, the IRE1\u03b1 siRNA+APO+TG group showed an increased level of apoptosis significantly.

To further validate the effects of apocynin on IRE1\u03b1 expression, qRT-PCR assays were performed. As a result, the mRNA expression of IRE1\u03b1 was obviously increased after the application of apocynin (0.5 mmol/L) for 8 h (Fig. 3c) .

In the present study, we found that the degree of XBP1 splicing, characterized by an increase in XBP1s and a decrease in XBP1u, was higher in TG-stimulated ECs with apocynin pretreatment when compared with TG stimulation alone. This result can be explained that apocynin enhances IRE1\u03b1 expression and thus promotes the adaptability of ECs. Therefore, when ER stress occurs, XBP1 splicing process can be intensified in condition of the high-level IRE1\u03b1 deposit, tilting the balance of IRE1\u03b1 signaling toward EC survival.

            "text": "Besides the research findings, there are also some limitations in this study. For example, the exact mechanism by which apocynin upregulates the expression of IRE1\u03b1 is still yet to be explored in the future. It also remains to be further investigated on whether and how apocynin affects dimerization and autotransphosphorylation of IRE1\u03b1. IRE1\u03b1 exists as a monomer in basal conditions, while the luminal domain of IRE1\u03b1 undergoes dimerization upon activation. The dimerization promotes autotransphosphorylation and leads to the activation of RNase domain which is responsible for XBP1s generation. Accordingly, the detection for IRE1\u03b1 dimerization and autotransphosphorylation is important to clarify the activation behavior of IRE1\u03b1. IRE1\u03b1 dimerization can be evaluated by detecting the foci formation of IRE1\u03b1-GFP [26] and BiFC assay [27] . Recently, Amin-Wetzel et al. also established a new method to measure the endogenous IRE1\u03b1 dimerization in cells [28] . Newbatt et al. reported a DELFIA technology that is specific for detecting IRE1\u03b1 autotransphosphorylation [29] . Hopefully, we can apply some of these methods to clarify whether apocynin regulates the activation of IRE1\u03b1 directly.",

Apocynin upregulates the expression of IRE1\u03b1 and promotes IRE1\u03b1-mediated XBP1 splicing. Our findings shed light on the novel protective mechanism of apocynin, which may provide a HUVECs were treated with APO at the indicated dose for 8 h. For a and b, DMSO was used as solvent control. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-XBP1s antibody. The ratio of immunointensity between XBP1s and GAPDH was calculated. c HUVECs were treated or untreated with APO (0.5 mmol/L) for 8 h. DMSO was used as solvent control. XBP1s and GAPDH mRNAs were run simultaneously in the same qRT-PCR assay. XBP1s mRNA levels were normalized by corresponding GAPDH mRNA levels. d HUVECs were stimulated with TG (1 \u00b5mol/L) for 8 h, with or without APO (0.5 mmol/L) pretreatment. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-XBP1s antibody. The ratio of immunointensity between XBP1s and GAPDH was calculated.
