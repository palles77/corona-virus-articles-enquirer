Intranasal coadministration of BPPcysMPEG with a plasmid carrying the SOD-encoding gene (pcDNA-SOD) into BALB/c mice elicited antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Humoral responses were characterized by the stimulation of IgG2a and IgG1 and by the presence of SOD-specific secretory IgA in nasal and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. Furthermore, T-cell proliferative responses and increased production of gamma interferon were also observed upon splenocyte restimulation with recombinant SOD. Cytotoxic responses were also stimulated, as demonstrated by the lysis of RB51-SOD-infected J774.A1 macrophages by cells recovered from immunized mice. The pcDNA-SOD/BPPcysMPEG formulation induced improved protection against challenge with the virulent strain B. abortus 2308 in BALB/c mice over that provided by pcDNA-SOD, suggesting the potential of this vaccination strategy against Brucella infection.",

            "text": "In the infected host, B. abortus multiplies within the phagosomes of reticuloendothelial cells, avoiding the killing effect of the macrophages by inhibiting phagosome-lysosome fusion (4) . Like other facultative intracellular bacterial pathogens, resistance to B. abortus depends on acquired cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (5) . The Th1 subset of CD4 \u03e9 lymphocytes that secrete gamma interferon (IFN-\u2425), which upregulates macrophage anti-Brucella activity, seems to present a critical bacterial clearance mechanism (6, 7) . Concerning the role played by CD8 \u03e9 cells, there are contrasting reports in the literature. Some studies concluded that CD8 \u03e9 T cells are critical for the resolution of infection (7, 8) , whereas others suggested that they are dispensable (9) . However, the protective response against Brucella does not rely only on CMI; antibodies also have been shown to contribute toward bacterial clearance (10, 11) . Although the contributing role of secretory IgA (sIgA) against B. abortus is still unclear, it may be relevant for protection against mucosal transmission. Therefore, while the induction of systemic immune responses following immunization represents a major goal for the ideal vaccine against brucellosis, stimulation of the mucosal immune response following vaccination may represent a true asset. To achieve this aim, one might need to use adjuvants, substances that exhibit immunopotentiating and immuno-modulatory properties, which are coadministered with the antigen in the vaccine formulations. One of these adjuvants is S- [2,3- bispalmitoyiloxy-(2R)-propyl]-R-cysteinyl-amido-monomethoxy polyethylene glycol (BPPcysMPEG), a pegylated synthetic derivative of macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2). This compound exhibits improved solubility with respect to MALP-2 and retains its Toll-like receptor 2/6 agonistic capacity on antigen-presenting cells (12, 13) . In addition, it induces proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines (14, 15) and promotes cross-priming and T-helper cell-dependent cytotoxic responses (16) . BPPcysMPEG exerts its activity when administered by either the parenteral or the mucosal route (16) (17) (18) .",

            "text": "Mucosal surfaces are the portal of entry for Brucella species in humans and animals. Therefore, large epithelial surfaces, such as the respiratory, intestinal, and urogenital tracts, need to be protected against penetration to prevent systemic dissemination to target organs. This has led to the concept that a successful vaccine should be able to trigger not only agent-specific immunity at a systemic level (27) but also an efficient local mucosal immunity (28) . Unfortunately, soluble antigens administered via the mucosal route are usually very poorly immunogenic (29) . Thus, different strategies have been developed to increase immunogenicity, including the use of mucosal adjuvants (30, 31) . BPPcysMPEG was proven to be an efficient compound for promoting immune responses at the systemic and mucosal levels when coadministered with a vaccine antigen (23, (32) (33) (34) . Sufficient experimental evidence supports the ability of pcDNA-SOD, a plasmid containing the Brucella Cu,Zn SOD-encoding gene, to promote immune protection in mice (19, 35) and SOD-specific immune responses in cattle (20) following vaccination. In the present study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy conferred in mice upon i.n. inoculation with a vaccine formulation containing pcDNA-SOD coadministered with BPPcysMPEG. The results show that immunization with pcDNA-SOD or pcDNA-SOD/BPPcysMPEG triggers SOD-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in BALB/c mice. At a systemic level, pcDNA-SOD/BPPcysMPEG promoted the stimulation of SOD-specific IgG2a and IgG1 responses, suggesting elicitation of a balanced Th1/Th2-type cellular immune response (36) . In agreement with previous studies, immunization with pcDNA-SOD appears to promote a Th1-biased immune response (19) . At the mucosal level, i.n. immunization with pcDNA-SOD/ BPPcysMPEG resulted in the induction of antigen-specific sIgA in BAL and NAL fluids.",

Significantly increased secretion of IL-4 was observed only in splenocytes derived from mice immunized with pcDNA-SOD/BPPcysMPEG. Conversely, restimulated splenocytes from pcDNA-SOD-and pcDNA-SOD /BPPcysMPEG-immunized mice showed weak CBP-specific proliferative responses, which can be explained by low-level expressions of SOD in the CBPs compared to that in the total protein content.

Thus, we performed a comparative evaluation of the capacity to induce a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response from pcDNA-SOD when administered alone or together with BPPcysMPEG. splenocytes from mice immunized with pcDNA-SOD, pcDNA-SOD /BPPcysMPEG, pcDNA/BPPcysMPEG, pcDNA3.1, or PBS were stimulated for 5 days with J774.A1 macrophages infected with B. abortus RB51-SOD at a ratio of 1:100 (cells to RB51-SOD). These effector cells were then incubated with either J774.A1 cells or J774.A1 cells infected with RB51-SOD. A CytoTox-ONE assay was used to measure target lysis. The data are means from experiments performed in triplicate, and standard deviations did not exceed 20% of the means. E, effector; T, target. *, statistically significant (P \u03fd 0.001) compared to negative-control groups or between pcDNA-SOD and pcDNA-SOD/ BPPcysMPEG groups. These two vaccine formulations promoted cytotoxic responses, but the strongest response was observed with the BPPcys MPEG-adjuvanted formulation. This is in agreement with results from previous studies demonstrating that BPPcysMPEG induces maturation of CD8\u2423 \u03e9 and CD8\u2423 \u03ea dendritic cells, resulting in enhanced cross-presentation and a robust helper-cell-dependent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response (16) . To confirm that the observed immunological response induced upon vaccination with pcDNA-SOD or pcDNA-SOD/BPPcysMPEG translates into effective protection against B. abortus infection, we performed challenge studies. The obtained data demonstrate that only the vaccinated mice were protected against infection and that coadministration of BPPcysMPEG resulted in superior protection. In conclusion, our results show that i.n. immunization with pcDNA-SOD coadministered with BPPcysMPEG leads to SODspecific systemic and mucosal immunity, which in turn confers protection against B. abortus infection, with an improved response compared to that of immunization with pcDNA-SOD alone.",
