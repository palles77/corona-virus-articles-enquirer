The sample included 84 younger adults and 55 older adults that were equally distributed across the two cultures. Results revealed that older Americans displayed a higher level of dispositional optimism than did younger Americans; whereas older Chinese showed a lower level of dispositional optimism than did their younger counterparts. Findings shed light on the mixed findings on age-related dispositional optimism in the literature.",

            "text": "Research on age differences in dispositional optimism has yielded mixed findings: some studies revealed an age-related increase in dispositional optimism, but others did not (Chapin 2001; Herzberg et al. 2006; Isaacowitz 2005; Lennings 2000; Robinson-Whelen et al. 1997) . Some possible explanations for these findings have been proposed, in terms of the moderating or mediating roles of religion (Mattis et al. 2004) , stress (Robinson-Whelen et al. 1997) , coping (Mayers and Derakshan 2004; Nicholls et al. 2008) , and self regulation (Umstattd et al. 2007) . In this study, we propose another moderator: socio-cultural contexts. We argue that these inconsistencies in findings on dispositional optimism might at least in part be the results of socio-cultural contexts. Given the fact that individuals develop their personal characteristics throughout the lifespan, at least in part, according to what their socio-cultural contexts emphasize (Baltes et al. 2006; Fung and Ng 2006) , age differences in dispositional optimism might occur in different directions when the socio-cultural contexts differ. To test this hypothesis, this study examined age differences in dispositional optimism among Americans and Chinesetwo cultural groups that have been empirically shown to differ in dispositional optimism (Lee and Seligman 1997) . We tested whether older Americans might display a higher level of dispositional optimism and older Chinese display a lower level of dispositional optimism than their younger counterparts, given that Americans emphasize dispositional optimism more than do Chinese (Lee and Seligman 1997) .",

Due to the positive relationships between dispositional optimism and many physical and psychological outcomes (Scheier and Carver 1993) , there has been an increased interest in the literature on how dispositional optimism develops with age. However, the findings so far are inconsistent. For example, a longitudinal study found that future attitude at age 13 had a positive but weak association with dispositional optimism at age 43 (Daukantaite and Bergman 2005) . Lennings (2000) further revealed an age-related increase in dispositional optimism in a sample aged from 55 to 99 years. In addition, Chapin (2001) found that age was negatively associated with selfprotective pessimism toward health risks in a community sample with age ranging from 14 to 78 years. These findings indicate a positive relationship between age and dispositional optimism.",

Isaacowitz (2005) did not find any significant age differences in dispositional optimism after controlling for covariates, despite the fact that older Americans displayed a higher level of optimistic explanatory style in affiliation domain but a lower level of optimistic explanatory style in health domain. Another study found that older Americans with caregiving stress were more optimistic and less pessimistic than those without life stress (Robinson-Whelen et al. 1997) . In an African-American sample, it was found that only older adults who had a positive relationship with God had a higher level of optimism and a lower level of pessimism compared to younger counterparts (Mattis et al. 2004 ). Other than these findings from Western cultures, two studies on Chinese found a comparable level of dispositional optimism among high-school students, undergraduate students and middle-aged adults (30-45 years), and within all these groups, age was unrelated to dispositional optimism (Lai and Cheng 2004; Lai and Yue 2000) . It suggests that the relationship underlying age and dispositional optimism may be shaped by various other factors such as life stress and religious beliefs.",

For example, our prior study (Fung and Ng 2006) found that older Chinese, but not older Canadians, endorsed Ren Qing (relationship orientation, a socially desirable personal characteristic in Chinese culture) to a greater extent than did their younger counterparts.",

These cultural differences may in turn determine the direction for age differences in dispositional optimism. Specifically, in Western cultures, being a good person means being unique, independent, and self-sufficient (Hamamura and Heine 2007; Markus and Kitayama 1991) . To maintain a good self-image, individuals are motivated to attend to positive information regarding the self and the environment. As a result, individuals may tend to have a positive expectation for the future. On the contrary, in Eastern cultures, being a good person means being successful at maintaining good relationships with others (Hamamura and Heine 2007; Markus 2004) . To this end, individuals are expected to adjust to others' demands and not to stand out from the group (Lai and Yue 2000) . Having a positive expectation for one's own future is thus not encouraged, particularly when such a positive expectation disrupts the existing social hierarchy and implies that the individual is or will soon be ''better'' or ''superior'' than the rest of the group in some domains.",

Lee and Seligman (1997) found that Mainland Chinese had a lower level of optimism than did Chinese-Americans and European-Americans, using a self-reported attribution style questionnaire. By asking Canadian and Japanese participants to estimate the likelihood that positive or negative life events would occur to self or other, Heine and Lehman (1995) found that Japanese showed a higher level of pessimism when predicting both positive and negative life events than did Canadians. Chang et al. (2001) also found that while European-Americans were more optimistic in predicting negative events, Japanese were more pessimistic in predicting positive events. Moreover, dispositional optimism was found to be associated with many measures of cultural values, including independent-interdependent self-construal, uncertainty avoidance, self-enhancement and self-criticism, collectivism and individualism (Chang 1996; Fischer and Chalmers 2008; Lai and Yue 2000) , suggesting that the developmental trajectories of dispositional optimism can potentially be shaped by what cultures emphasize.",

In other words, we expected younger adults to show cultural differences in dispositional optimism, with Americans endorsing dispositional optimism to a greater extent than did Chinese.

Findings supported these predictions. Moreover, the findings remained unchanged even after we had taken demographic and socioemotional variables, including education and positive affects, into account. These findings generally supported our argument that age differences in personal characteristics may vary with cultures according to what the respective cultures emphasize (Fung and Ng 2006) . To the extent that our findings on cross-sectional age and cultural differences in dispositional optimism reflect developmental changes, they suggest that Americans, who as a culture has a stronger emphasis on optimism, become more optimistic with age; Chinese, who as a culture places less emphasis on optimism, become less optimistic with age.",

This might have introduced biases to the results as the younger and older generations may not share the same levels of cultural values (Rozin 2003) . We minimized this limitation by including older as well as younger adults in our sample and we indeed found significant age differences in dispositional optimism across cultures, suggesting that cross-cultural aging studies may be a useful way to study cultural differences.",

            "text": "Finally, we acknowledge several limitations in the study. First, this study is a cross-sectional study, and thus it is hard to distinguish cohort effects from developmental changes. Rozin (2003) argued that age differences in personality characteristics might be caused by globalization or economic development. Longitudinal studies are needed to address this question in the future. Second, compared with prior cross-cultural studies, the sample size of this study is small. Although we managed to find significant results with our small sample, suggesting that the study has sufficient power, larger samples are needed to test whether our findings can be replicated. Finally, we only measured dispositional optimism globally. Isaacowitz (2005) argued that optimism could be domain-specific. When examining future-oriented expectations within specific domains, he found that older adults displayed more optimistic explanatory style in affiliation domain, but less optimistic explanatory style within health and cognition domains than did younger adults. Consistent with these findings, the cross-cultural literature has found different patterns of cultural differences in optimism when examining optimism within specific contexts (Ji et al. 2004) . Future studies should examine the effects of age and culture on optimism at both general and domain-specific levels.",

These findings provide further support for our argument derived from socioemotional selectivity theory that individuals may develop their personal characteristics with age according to what cultures emphasize. This has implications for the literature on adult development.",
