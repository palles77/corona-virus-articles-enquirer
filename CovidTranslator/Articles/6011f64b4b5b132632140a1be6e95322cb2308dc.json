            "text": "System-based cointegration methods, and their dynamic counterpart vector error correction models (VECMs), have become popular tools for economic analysis and forecasting. Cointegration analysis addresses the problem of spurious regressions among non-stationary time series. Estimation in a system context may shed light on important interrelationships among series, while reducing the risk of endogeneity bias. 3 However, system methods introduce additional challenges, chief among them being the problem of identifying individual structural relationships. In a system with cointegrating rank r , Pesaran and Shin (2001) show that exact identification requires r restrictions in each of the r cointegrating vectors. The popular Johansen (1988 Johansen ( , 1991 Johansen ( , 1995 method uses a statistical approach to achieve the needed restrictions. Pesaran and Shin (2001) and Pesaran and Smith (1998) criticize this approach as a pure mathematical convenience, and instead advocate a theory-based approach. Hall, Henry, and Greenslade (2002) argue that the different identification methods proposed in the literature are almost impossible to implement in practice, due to the limited sample sizes typically available for empirical research. As an alternative, they suggest testing and imposing theory-based weak exogeneity assumptions at the earliest stage of the model reduction process. In this paper, we apply the Hall et al. (2002) strategy to the problem of estimating a structural econometric model of Hawaii tourism, where both demand and supply-side influences may be important.",

Nearly all existing studies focus solely on the demand side of the market, attempting to model either the demand arising from alternative source-country markets for a particular tourism destination, or the allocation of outbound travel demand to alternative destinations. 4 The application of cointegration analysis and the associated error-correction dynamic specifications to tourism demand modeling began in the mid-1990s, and is now relatively common. In many cases, single-equation methods have been used with little or no consideration of potential endogeneity problems (see for example Gonzalez & Moral, 1995; Kim & Song, 1998; Song, Romilly, & Liu, 2000; Vogt & Wittayakorn, 1998) . When system approaches are used (for example Dritsakis, 2004; Gangnes & Bonham, 1998; Kulendran & King, 1997; Kulendran & Witt, 2001 , 2003 Lim & McAleer, 2001; Song & Witt, 2003) , identification is obtained exclusively using Johansen's reduced rank regression technique, and identified cointegrating relationships are often simply assumed to represent demand functions. 5 4 There are a number of comprehensive reviews of tourism demand modeling and forecasting, including Crouch (1994a,b) , Li, Song, and Witt (2005) , Lim (1997 Lim ( , 1999 , Song and Li (2008) and Witt (1992, 1995) .

In recent years, we have begun to see the development of optimization-based models of aspects of the tourism industry, often directed toward the question of optimal taxation of tourist spending (see for example Copeland, 1989 Copeland, , 1990 Gooroochurn, 2004; Lu, Chang, & Hu, 2008; Morely, 1992; Piga, 2006; Taylor, 1995) .

Literature on the supply-side of the industry and pricing behavior is much more limited.",

For inbound modeling, the most appropriate measure is real expenditures on tourism-related goods and services. However, the unavailability and often poor quality of expenditure data confine the typical study to total visitor arrivals (Anastasopoulos, 1984; O'Hagan & Harrison, 1984) . Of the 81 tourism demand studies reviewed by Li et al. (2005) , nearly 70% choose the number of visitor arrivals as the measure of demand, while 35% use expenditures or expenditure shares.

Typical income measures include gross domestic product, gross national product, national disposable income, personal income, and consumption expenditures, measured in either real, nominal, aggregate, or per capita form, depending on data availability and the nature of the tourism demand being modeled. 6 Several types of prices appear in the demand specification. The first is the own price of tourism products, usually approximated by the consumer price index in the destination market. 7 Second are measures of substitute prices. Because domestic travel may substitute for foreign travel, aggregate prices 6 Generally speaking, personal income or consumption expenditures are used to model leisure and holiday travel, while gross domestic or national product and national disposable income are used to model business travel. As for the choice between nominal and real incomes, Eqs. (1) and (2) make it clear that both are acceptable, provided that prices are specified accordingly. A per capita income specification is justified by Witt and Witt (1995) as a solution to the multicollinearity problem when both income and population are used to measure market size. 7 This practice is sometimes criticized on the grounds that \"the cost of living for local residents does not always reflect the cost of living for foreign visitors to that destination, especially in poor countries\" (Song & Witt, 2000) . Occasionally tourism-specific prices are employed. For example, Gangnes and Bonham (1998) use the hotel room price. Others (Edwards, 1995; Martin & Witt, 1987; Witt & Witt, 1992) argue against the use of tourism-specific indices because their coverage may be suspect, and there is little evidence of superior performance. in the country of origin are often included. At the same time, competition among different overseas destinations may call for the inclusion of variables that represent the costs of substitute destinations. Exchange rate adjusted relative prices (real exchange rates) are commonly used as proxies for both effects. 8 Finally, transportation costs are sometimes included as a separate factor in determining travel. 9 Many studies augment income and price variables with deterministic effects: time trends to capture evolving consumer tastes; a constant term to account for \"utility image\" that does not vary greatly with time; dummies to account for various one-off events such as the Olympic Games, large-scale fairs, foreign currency/travel restrictions and oil crises; seasonality; or changes in data collection methods. These types of events, if otherwise neglected, might lead to bias in the estimated parameters (Anastasopoulos, 1984; Crouch, Schultz, & Valerio, 1992; Kliman, 1981; Mak, Moncur, & Yonamine, 1977) .",

We seek to identify the demand relationship for each of the two primary Hawaii tourism markets, US and Japanese visitors. Tourists from these two markets consistently account for over 85% of all visitors. To keep the model size manageable, we do not include visitors from other destinations. For the same reason, we include only the principle determinants of tourism demand, leaving out influences that are deemed less 8 Martin and Witt (1987) report that the CPI-based real exchange rate is a good proxy for tourism cost, while the nominal exchange rate itself is not. Some studies (Kim & Song, 1998; include real exchange rates from a number of competing countries, while others (Vogt & Wittayakorn, 1998 ) use a single weighted real exchange rate. Some authors (Lathiras & Siriopoulos, 1998; Vogt & Wittayakorn, 1998) argue that nominal exchange rates should be included separately from source and destination price levels, because tourists may respond very differently to them. 9 Song and Witt (2000) suggest using \"representative air fares between origin and destination for air travel,\" as in Crouch (1991) and Fujii, Khaled, and Mak (1985) . Gangnes and Bonham (1998) reject such a practice on the ground that \"frequent discounting and package trips\" imply a significantly lower actual price than published fares. Edwards (1995) uses International Air Transport Association (IATA) data on revenues per passenger ton/km. Perhaps because of data limitations, Li et al. (2005) report that only about 30% of recent tourism demand models included a measure of travel cost. central to our analysis. In addition, some conceptually relevant factors are excluded because of the difficulty of finding appropriate proxies. The model includes five demand determinants: US real personal income (yr us), US consumer price index (cpi us), Japanese real personal income (yr j p), Japanese exchange rate adjusted CPI (cpi E j p) and Hawaii average daily hotel room price ( pr m).

However, the infinite elasticity assumption is a convenient simplification rather than a tested hypothesis. Fujii et al.

As a result, in the short run there is a considerable incentive for the hotelier to fill an empty room by discounting the price to almost as low as the negligible marginal cost of filling a room, leading to price incentives during off-peak periods. 13 Over longer horizons, capacity is adjusted through expansion and contraction of room inventory. One approach to modeling the room supply is to estimate an inverted supply curve. Examples of this appear in the hotel room tax literature (Bonham & Gangnes, 1996; Fujii et al., 1985) . The supply price of hotel rooms is assumed to be a mark-up over the marginal cost,",

Here, for consistency with demand-side modeling, we use the sum of US and Japanese visitors (vus + v j p), ignoring the limited number of Hawaii visitors from other markets. The parameter on arrivals is a measure of the (inverse) long-run supply elasticity of lodging services. In the short term, the markup over the marginal cost should be sensitive to excess demand/supply conditions, as suggested above. We include the occupancy rate (ocup) as a proxy for these influences. It would be desirable to include Hawaii-specific input cost measures, but other than local wage rates, such measures do not exist. Considering the limited time span of available data (86 observations) and the number of variables already present in the demand model, we have elected to treat the US consumer price index (cpi us) as a rough proxy for cost influences.",

We hypothesize that the four tourism variables, y t = (vus, v j p, pr m, ocup), are endogenous, and the remaining external factors, x t = (yr us, cpi us, yr j p, cpi E j p), are exogenous. For a system with eight variables, there can exist at most seven cointegrating vectors. 20 Following the strategy outlined in Section 3, we leave the cointegrating rank unrestricted (r = 7) and test the null hypothesis, H 0 : \u03b1 x = 0, for each candidate exogenous variable. (That is, we exclude all cointegrating vectors from equations explaining the \"theoretically\" exogenous variables.) We cannot reject weak exogeneity of US real income, yr us, or the exchange-rate-adjusted Japanese price level, cpi E j p; tests for both variables have marginal significance levels ( p-values) in excess of 10% (see Table 2 , Panel 1). In contrast, weak exogeneity of both the US price level, cpi us, and Japanese real income, yr j p, is strongly rejected at the 1% level. 21 While \u03b1 x = 0 is a necessary and sufficient condition for weak exogeneity of x t with respect to \u03b2, this condition often proves to be too 20 We treat all variables in the HTM as I(1). Zhou, Bonham, and Gangnes (2004) report augmented Dickey Fuller (Dickey & Fuller, 1979 , 1981 , Perron (1990) and Schwert (1989) tests for unit roots in each variable studied here. We select the lag length for our initial VAR by estimating a VAR in levels with a maximum of five lags, and sequentially reducing the lag length by one lag until we maximize the Schwarz information criterion, subject to non-rejection of the null hypothesis of no serial correlation up to lag 6. We select a lag length of 4. (The results of these tests are available from the authors on request.) 21 Because weak exogeneity depends on the model specification, Hall et al. (2002) suggest exogenizing any non-rejecting weakly exogenous variables and re-testing the remaining variables. Treating yr us and cpi E j p as weakly exogenous, we re-estimate the system with six endogenous variables, two exogenous variables, and five unrestricted cointegrating vectors, r = 5. The test results (not shown) continue to strongly reject the null hypothesis of weak exogeneity of both cpi us and yr j p at less than the 1% significance level. strong in practice, because exogenous variables may form cointegrating relationships among themselves (Pesaran, Shin, & Smith, 2000) . In our case, because of macroeconomic relationships within and between the US and Japan, it is likely that our vector, x t = (yr us, cpi us, yr j p, cpi E j p), of hypothesized weakly exogenous variables is cointegrated. 22 The rejection of \u03b1 x = 0 may occur due to cointegration among the exogenous variables, rather than because of their endogeneity for the parameters of interest in the HTM. Nevertheless, weak exogeneity can still be tested, following the approach suggested by Harbo, Johansen, Nielsen, and Rahbek (1998) . Instead of estimating the whole system and testing whether a subset of \u03b1 is zero, they suggest estimating the conditional model alone and checking for weak exogeneity by adding the empirically derived cointegrating relationships to the marginal model. The null hypothesis of weak exogeneity implies that in the marginal model, the loading parameters on the estimated equilibrium relationships are insignificantly different from zero. The results from the Harbo test for weak exogeneity are reported in Panel 2 of Table 2 (note that the cointegrating vectors used in these tests are identified in Section 4.3 below). The first differences of the \"exogenous\" variables (\u2206yr us, \u2206cpi us, \u2206yr j p and \u2206cpi E j p) are each regressed on the lagged first differences of all variables, the three identified cointegrating vectors and a constant. We test the joint null hypothesis that the loading parameters on all three cointegrating vectors are insignificantly different from zero in each equation in the marginal system. F-tests for this null hypothesis are presented in Panel 2 of Table 2 . We do not reject the null hypothesis of weak exogeneity for any of the variables in the x t = (yr us, cpi us, yr j p, cpi E j p) vector at the 5% marginal significance level. Below, we test for the rank of the cointegrating space, subject to these weak exogeneity restrictions.",

In the vector representing Japanese visitor demand (9), we normalize on Japanese visitor arrivals, and exclude US visitor arrivals (\u03b2 2,1 = 0) and US real income (\u03b2 2,5 = 0). Finally, for the supply vector (10) we normalize on the hotel room price, and exclude both US and Japanese income (\u03b2 3,5 , \u03b2 3,7 = 0). Parameter 23 Following Pesaran et al. (2000) , we allow for an unrestricted intercept in the VECM (4) and restrict the time trends to lie in the cointegrating space. We can then test the hypothesis that the time trend can be excluded from the cointegrating vectors. Table 4 Just-identified system.

Note that the income elasticity in the just-identified US demand relationship is implausibly large and estimated quite imprecisely. While the tourism literature often reports income elasticities in excess of two, we restrict the elasticity to the smallest statistically acceptable value, because we expect that a larger income elasticity will adversely impact the forecasting performance of the HTM. We cannot reject the restriction that the US real income elasticity (\u03b2 1,5 ) is 3.5, but smaller values are rejected. The estimated relative price elasticity of \u22120.55 is well within the range of estimates reported in the literature. 24 The comparison of price elasticity estimates is more difficult because of the many alternative price measures used. Witt and Witt (1995) report a median own price elasticity of \u22120.7 for studies using destination cost. Sheldon's (1993) results imply a median destination price elasticity of \u22121.2, and an exchange rate elasticity of \u22121.6. Again, the range of price elasticity estimates is very large, ranging from \u22127.3 to 1.6 for destination prices, and from \u22127.6 to 4.1 for exchange rates.

All equations pass all diagnostic tests at the 5% significance level. The existence of long-run equilibrium error terms in the model equations allows for a temporary disequilibrium between causal variables and the demand and supply variables. The adjustment factors (\u03b1s) capture the speed of adjustment toward the equilibrium relationship. For example, if US arrivals are less than predicted by US real income growth and the relative cost of a Hawaii vacation, arrivals would increase over time to eliminate the disequilibrium error. The three long-run equilibrium errors enter the four equations differently. The equation for US visitor growth, \u2206vus, contains both \u03be Dus and \u03be S . The loading parameter on the US demand equilibrium error, \u03be Dus , is \u22120.11, so 11% of the equilibrium error is corrected each period. In the equation for Japanese visitor growth, \u2206v j p, the equilibrium error associated with Japanese visitor demand, \u03be D j p , enters with a coefficient of \u22120.34, implying a complete adjustment towards equilibrium in slightly less than three quarters. The equilibrium errors for US demand, \u03be Dus , and the pricing rule, \u03be S , enter the hotel room price equation, \u2206 pr m, while all three errors enter the equation for the change in hotel occupancy, \u2206ocup.

In only one case, the ARIMA model forecast of the occupancy rate, does a competitor forecast result in a MSE statistically smaller than the HTM forecasts. The same basic conclusion holds when evaluating the relatively small sample (four forecasts) of twelve-step-ahead forecasts. The HTM produces forecasts with MSEs that are statistically smaller than those of the LVARX and DLVARX forecasts in three of four cases, and statistically dominate the ARIMA forecasts in two of three cases. The DLVARX model again produces the best forecast for the hotel room price, and the ARIMA forecasts are statistically more accurate than the HTM in two cases. In summary, the HTM model produced statistically more accurate forecasts than the LVARX, DLVARX, and ARIMA models in 83%, 42%, and 50% of the comparisons. The same three models produced statistically more accurate forecasts than the HTM model in 0%, 17%, and 30% of the comparisons. Much of the literature that has examined the accuracy of tourism forecasting models has found that sophisticated methods, including error correction models, often produce forecasts which are no better than or inferior to those from relatively simple ARIMA models. 30 In the case of the HTM, based on formal tests of accuracy, we find that the HTM routinely outperforms other VARX competitors and has a slight advantage over its ARIMA competitor. In forecasting both Japanese visitor arrivals and room prices, the HTM dominates the ARIMA model at each forecast horizon, while the ARIMA model dominates the HTM for all forecasts of the occupancy rate. The relatively good performance of the VECM model suggests that the methodology warrants further study.",

Based on the Diebold and Mariano (1995) tests for forecast accuracy, the HTM routinely outperforms other VARX competitors, but has an advantage over its ARIMA competitor in fewer cases. The failure to consistently outperform simple ARIMA models is consistent with the findings of many previous studies, but the common observation bears repeating, that structural models like the HTM provide additional benefits over pure time series models by providing structural insight and by permitting scenario analysis. Hall et al.'s (2002) pragmatic approach to identifying structural relationships in a VECM appears to hold promise for tourism modeling and forecasting, as well as for other settings where there are important sources of endogeneity and where available data samples are limited. The approach can be applied wherever the model's scope can be restricted to a limited number of cointegrating relationships, for example in analyzing demand (and supply) behavior for an overall visitor market, or distinguishing the behavior of two or perhaps three separate markets, for example domestic and international, within a region and outside of the region, etc. And certainly there are markets like Hawaii where one or two source countries dominate arrivals; an example is Las Vegas, where in 2007 88% of visitors were domestic and only 12% were from foreign countries.",
