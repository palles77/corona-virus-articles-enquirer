For patients not 138 able to visit the pharmacy, mail order or home delivery service can be offered by working with 139 social works, volunteers, care coordinators, or drug companies. Through close collaboration with 140 such personnels and organizations, Chinese community pharmacies have made great 141 achievement in ensuring adequate drug supply for community patients. For example, in 142 quarantined communities where residents are not allowed to go outside, pharmacies worked with 143 neighborhood committee staff to provide drug delivery services. For patients with special 144 diseases, such as cancer, hepatitis and irritable bowel disease, pharmacies worked with drug 145 companies to ensure their drug supply during the pandemic. 146 2.1.2 Ensure safe and efficient operation 147 Community pharmacies shall take measures to ensure safe and efficient operation during the 148 pandemic, such as appropriate environment control, staff protection and emergency plan 149 establishment.

Remote 180 access to pharmacists can be provided through phones, mobile APPs and the internet. In China, 181 physicians and pharmacists have been using mobile APPs to provide online consulting services. 182 This approach saves patients' trip to medical institutions and is safer to both healthcare providers 183 and patients comparing to traditional on-site visits. 184 The method to access pharmacists remotely can be publicized through posters or flyers in the 185 pharmacy and the surrounding communities, notifications on the internet, text messages or 186 emails. These routes can also be used to popularize strategies for scientific prevention and 187 control of the COVID-19. In addition, mail order or drug delivery services shall be provided if 188 possible to ensure patient's home supply of medications and reduce patients' needs for outdoor 189 pharmacy visits (as discussed in 2.1.1). 190 2.2.3 The model of community pharmacy services during the COVID-19 pandemic 191 See Figure 1 for the recommended model of community pharmacy service during the COVID-19 192 pandemic. As shown, the left side of community pharmacy listed three approaches through 193 which pharmacy service can be provided. On the right side, six domains of PC services are listed 194",

If the pharmacy is short on a prescription medication, a therapeutic 203 equivalent substitution shall be considered for dispensing under patient's agreement to avoid 204 additional traveling to other pharmacies. 205 Community pharmacy shall also establish a collaborate relationship with its surrounding fever 206 clinics and designated COVID-19 medical institutions for mutual patient information sharing 207 during transitions of care. It can happen both ways. At the pharmacy, patients shall be screened 208 with body temperature measurement. Pharmacists shall make extra efforts to identify suspected 209 patients based on clinical symptoms such as coughing and fatigue, and epidemiological history 210 such as travel history to Wuhan city or its surrounding areas in the past fourteen days. If such 211 patient is identified, immediate isolation in a single room shall be performed if possible and 212 pharmacist shall encourage and support the patient in seeking immediate medical treatment in 213 designated institutions. On the other side, a 14-day isolated observation at home is recommended 214",

            "text": "221During the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmacists shall actively provide guidance to community 222 patient population on chronic disease management to improve patients' medication adherence 223 and support their self-monitoring of the effectiveness and safety of current therapy. Pharmacists 224 shall instruct patients to take home medications on time with the same dosage as usual, and 225 emphasize the importance of adherence in chronic disease control and in avoiding unnecessary 226 hospital visits during the pandemic. Patients shall make sure the medication is within the period 227 of validity before taking. Do not take expired medications due to drug shortage or to avoid 228 pharmacy visits. Inform patients on the availability of drug delivery or mail order services 229 provided in the pharmacy and encourage patients to use such services during the pandemic if needed. 231In addition, chronic disease patients shall be educated to perform self-monitoring on disease 232 control and adverse drug reactions at home. For example, patients with stable hypertension shall 233 measure blood pressure 1-2 times a week at home. If the result is above systolic pressure of 180 234 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure of 110 mmHg, patient shall seek immediate medical assessment.235 Pharmacists shall also make sure patients are aware of the common adverse reactions of their 236 current medications and reinforce what side effects they shall monitor for during a long-term of 237 home stay. Help patients to understand the concept of adverse drug reactions appropriately, and 238 know how to distinguish minor side effects and severe drug reactions that needs medical 239 intervention. 240 For community patients with cancer, irritable bowel disease or other special chronic diseases or 241 patients taking high risk medications chronically, additional guidance shall be provided based on 242 the characteristics of the diseases or medications. For example, warfarin patients are at a high 243 risk of drug adverse reactions as they may not able to check INRs regularly and their diets are 244 susceptible to change during the pandemic. Pharmacists shall educate patients to monitor signs 245 and symptoms of bleeding and clotting. Patients with stable INR results can reasonably extend 246 the monitoring cycle. Community pharmacists in China have also been using mobile APPs to 247 organize such patient groups to provide consulting services and pharmacy drug supply 248 information online. 249 (3) Safe use of infusions 250 Due to the increased risk of cross infection among patients and healthcare providers, unnecessary 251 infusions shall be avoided during the COVID-19 pandemic. For medical institutions providing 252 infusion service, community pharmacists shall assist the care team in establishing a specific 253 safety operation process during patients' visits, in addition to providing regular pharmacy 254 services on medication safety. The safety operation process shall include a set of strategies, such 255 as environment cleaning and disinfection, patient screening at the gate, limiting patient numbers\uff0c 256 and separating patients with safe distance when lining up and infusing drugs, to prevent cross 257 infection in the medical institution and during the drug infusion. 258 (4) Patient education 259 Based on the need of community patients during the COVID-19 outbreak, patient education or 260 consulting services shall be provided by community pharmacists on disease prevention, 261 COVID-19 early identification, and proper medication use. Scientific prevention and control 262 knowledge of the COVID-19 shall be provided to community patients through a variety of Additionally, basic knowledge on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2, particularly the onset symptoms 267 and transmission routes, shall be provided to help community population understand the 268 pandemic situation properly and promote early identification of suspected individuals. Educate 269 patients on how to distinguish common cold, flu and COVID-19, and make sure they know when 270 to seek medical help. For patients only have upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny 271 nose and sore throat, and are relatively young with no baseline chronic disease, home care with 272 isolation and observation shall be performed with symptomatic treatment (if needed) first to 273 avoid unnecessary visits to medical institutions. Seek medical assistance if disease continue to 274progress or if the patient developed COVID-19-related symptoms[15]  . 275Pharmacists shall make it clear to patients that there is no effective vaccine or targeting 276 therapeutic agent for COVID-19 prevention or treatment at present. In case of suspected 277 symptoms such as fever, cough and fatigue, patients shall seek timely medical support and 278 follow physicians' treatment plan. Avoid blind use of medications or so-called \"wonder drugs\". 279When dispensing new medications, assess patients' current medication list to identify duplicate 280 therapy and provide medication education to ensure safe use of dispensed medications. 281 (5) Home care[8]   282Pharmacists can refer to the\"Home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus infection 283 presenting with mild symptoms and management of contacts (Interim guidance)\"published by 284 WHO to provide guidance for families with patients isolated at home for medical observation, 285 and families with mild stage patients on treatment at home.
