Unfortunately, the most potent adjuvants are often associated with toxicity and safety issues. Inulin, a plant-derived polysaccharide, has no immunological activity in its native soluble form but when crystallized into a stable microcrystalline particulate from (delta inulin) acquires potent adjuvant activity. Delta inulin has been shown to enhance humoral and cellular immune responses against a broad range of co-administered viral, bacterial, parasitic and toxin antigens. Inulin normally crystallizes as large heterogeneous particles with a broad size distribution and variable solubility temperatures. To ensure reproducible delta inulin particles with a consistent size distribution and temperature of solubility, a current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) process was designed to produce Advax TM adjuvant. In its cCMP form, Advax TM adjuvant has proved successful in human trials of vaccines against seasonal and pandemic influenza, hepatitis B and insect sting anaphylaxis, enhancing antibody and T-cell responses while being safe and well tolerated. Advax TM adjuvant represents a novel human adjuvant that enhances both humoral and cellular immunity. This review describes the discovery and development of Advax TM adjuvant and research into its unique mechanism of action.",

Inulin is utilized as a storage carbohydrate by plants of the Compositae family that include dahlias, chicory, artichoke, onions, and garlic (reviewed in [1] ). Inulin's medicinal uses date back to ancient times. Pedanios Dioscoride, a physician with the Roman army, in 100 AD reported the beneficial effects of chicory root extract (\u223c40% inulin by weight) for treatment of stomach, liver and kidney complaints [2] . In 1804, inulin was extracted by a German scientist from a boiling water extract of Inula helenium [3] . Based on its Inula source, Thomson in 1818 gave this extract the name, inulin [4] . Oral inulin's beneficial effects on metabolic disorders was re-discovered in 1874 with a report that diabetic patients lost their glycosuria when put on a diet of 100 g of inulin per day [3] . Dietary inulin not only has a favourable effect on blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes but also reduces fasting insulin concentrations, triacylglycerol levels [5] and hepatic lipogenesis [6] . Inulin has also been shown to reduce atherosclerotic lesions in Apo Edeficient mice [7] . Furthermore, short chain fatty acids including butyrate and propionate formed by inulin fermentation in the gut have anti-proliferative effects [8] and stimulate apoptosis of colon cancer cells, enhancing expression of enzymes including histone deacetylases involved in detoxification of carcinogens [9] . Inulin fermentation products in the gut also have anti-inflammatory effects and may help suppress autoimmune disease [10] .",

They confirmed the nontoxicity of inulin by intravenously injecting themselves with 160 g of soluble inulin thereby confirming inulin's exceptional safety [11] . Injection of soluble inulin subsequently became the gold standard for GFR measurement, with intravenous injection of a loading dose of 50 mg/kg body weight followed by an infusion to maintain steady plasma levels. Measurement of urinary inulin then provides an estimate of GFR. Many thousands of patients have safely had this GFR test including pregnant women and newborn babies, with no known adverse effects attributable to inulin other than a mild osmotic diuresis [12] . In the early days hospitals made their own inulin formulations and patients receiving inulin infusions occasionally developed transient hypotensive symptoms. This was found to reflect complement activation that was independent of the only then known (now called classical) complement pathway. A search for the mechanism of complement activation by inulin led to discovery of the alternative complement pathway (ACP) [13] . ACP activation was found to occur when injected inulin was not entirely dissolved with microscopic crystalline inulin contaminants responsible for ACP activation. Hence ACP activation is a unique feature of crystalline but not soluble inulin, a feature critical to inulin's use as a vaccine adjuvant as described below.",

An early demonstration of this anti-cancer effect utilized the complement activator, Staphylococcus aureus protein A Unfortunately, this also had major side effects including pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, and cardiopulmonary toxicity [14] . To avoid the problems of using S. aureus for complement activation, an alternative approach to cancer therapy was developed by Cooper et al. with the idea of instead using inulin crystals for complement activation [15] . This led to the development of a crystalline isoform of inulin given the name gamma inulin to distinguish it from highly soluble alpha and beta inulin isoforms [16] . Gamma inulin was potent at ACP activation in human plasma reaching a maximum at \u223c20 g/ml [17] . In mice, intraperitoneal administration of gamma inulin at doses of 0.2-0.5 mg induced greater than 50% serum complement depletion within 30 min with complement levels returning to normal within 16-24h [18] . Despite potent ACP activation, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injections of gamma inulin at doses up to 10 mg were well tolerated with mice not exhibiting any adverse effects. Intraperitoneal administration of gamma inulin to mice implanted with a B16 melanoma cell line prolonged survival times and depletion of complement factor 3 (C3) abrogated this protective effect, consistent with gamma inulin's anti-tumour effects being mediated by ACP activation [19] . Gamma inulin induced tumour regression when injected into squamous cell carcinomas in sheep, an effect enhanced by combination therapy with cyclophosphamide [18] . Intralesional injection of gamma inulin into equine sarcoids or spontaneous tumours in dogs similarly resulted in tumour regression (P. Cooper, personal communication). Gamma inulin also potentiated anti-cancer effects of photodynamic therapy in an ACP-dependent manner [20] .",

When tested in this way, gamma inulin proved to have a beneficial effect on adaptive immune responses. Many of the early studies were performed with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and when KLH was co-administered with gamma inulin this resulted in enhanced anti-KLH antibody responses in mice with similar results in guinea pigs and rabbits [22] .

Although it did not induce macrophage activation as measured by chemiluminescent respiratory burst, gamma inulin primed macrophages for a greater respiratory burst in response to phorbol ester. Incubation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with tetanus toxoid in the presence of gamma inulin resulted in enhanced IL-2 secretion when compared to toxoid alone, consistent with augmented antigen processing and presentation [18] . Cobra venom depletion of serum complement in mice prior to immunization blocked gamma inulin's adjuvant effects, consistent with adjuvant activity being dependent upon ACP activation [24] . In an attempt to enhance its adjuvant potency gamma inulin was co-crystallized with aluminium hydroxide to form Algammulin, resulting in further enhancement of antibody responses [17] . Nevertheless, Algammulin had significant drawbacks that prevented its development as a human vaccine adjuvant including potential toxicity of the aluminium adjuvant component [25, 26] , Th2-immune bias [27, 28] , and high batch-tobatch variability in potency. To overcome these problems, studies were undertaken into the structure and function of inulin with the aim of developing a more stable and consistent inulin adjuvant platform. This led to development of the delta inulin isoform that not only had much greater and more consistent adjuvant activity than gamma inulin but, most importantly, was able to be manufactured as a highly consistent cGMP product [29] . Delta inulin subsequently formed the basis of the Advax TM adjuvant platform.",

Inulin particles obtained by precipitation from cold water are referred to as alpha inulin and the particles obtained by precipitation from ethanol as beta inulin; dried commercial inulin is almost all in alpha Microscopic structures of crystalline inulin particles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals gamma inulin particles to have highly variable shape, size and structure (A), potentially explaining their large batch-to-batch variation in adjuvant activity. Initial delta inulin particles had better defined structure on TEM but still exhibited considerable size variation (B). Optimization and control of crystallization parameters allowed reproducible production of delta inulin particles of consistent size and shape (C) that subsequently formed the basis of Advax TM adjuvant. Freeze-fracture scanning EM of Advax TM particles suspended in water reveals their discoid shape and formation from lamellar sheets (D and E). Atomic force microscopy of Advax TM particles during their formation confirms their discoid character and also reveals fine filament precursors from which the final delta inulin particles are assembled (F). or beta forms. Both alpha and beta isoforms are highly soluble and readily dissolved in water at 25 \u2022 C, gamma inulin starts to become soluble in water at 37 \u2022 C, and delta inulin is insoluble at temperatures below 40 \u2022 C, an important distinction as this means that delta inulin particles are insoluble at body temperatures. Hence, the key factor behind understanding of delta inulin is the fact that inulin polymers can be crystallized into discrete isoforms characterized by different solubility rates in aqueous media [29, 30] . In essence, each inulin particle is made up of individual inulin polymers each formed into an antiparallel double helix, with these helixes then being aggregated together through lateral hydrogen bonding to form lamellar sheets [29, 31, 32] . The greater stability of delta inulin when compared to earlier inulin isoforms reflects greater aggregate strength of H-bonding between each of the individual inulin polymers forming the crystal structure [30] . Transmission and scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy studies of delta inulin particles show consistent spherulite-like discoid particles 1-2 m in diameter made up of a series of lamellar sheets [33] . Better knowledge of the structural basis of delta inulin crystallization assisted design of a cGMP production process, thereby ensuring ability to produce Advax TM adjuvant particles with a highly consistent size and reproducible adjuvant properties, as shown in Fig. 2 . This was in marked contrast to the highly irregular shape, size and inconsistent adjuvant properties of gamma inulin and initial non-GMP delta inulin formulations.",

            "text": "Gamma and delta inulin both activate the ACP [29] . It is not known exactly why these inulin structures are such potent complement activators, although they do have a high number of surface hydroxyl groups recognized as important to complement activation. Virtually any biological surface can activate the ACP provided no sialic acid moieties are present with sialic acid functioning as a discriminator to protect vertebrate surfaces from self-complement attack [34] . Complement factor C3b has only a moderate preference for spontaneous reaction with glucose or fructose moieties [35] . Hence, inulin polymers themselves have no particular features to suggest high C3 convertase activation activity. Indeed, soluble inulin polymers have no ability to activate complement. For ACP initiation to lead to the rapid amplification of complement activation, the labile C3 convertase products produced by ACP activation must be localized on a surface site relatively protected from circulating complement inhibitors and degrading enzymes [35] . Therefore, it is possible that the surface of gamma and delta inulin crystal packing structures is able to protect activated complement components. Despite potent ACP activation capability, both gamma and delta inulin are extremely well tolerated even when injected at high doses. This suggests that the complement activation they induce occurs in a controlled fashion that avoids production of toxic downstream mediators. We hypothesize that delta inulin may activate complement regulators such as clusterin thereby blocking production of downstream anaphylatoxins and complement membrane attack complexes [36] . If so, this could explain how delta inulin is able to separate the beneficial effects on adaptive immunity from the harmful downstream effects of complement membrane attack complexes.",

Consequently, development of gamma inulin was ceased more than decade ago and efforts instead refocused on delta inulin, in the form of Advax TM adjuvant. Whilst Advax TM adjuvant is comprised of delta inulin, the terms Advax TM and delta inulin are not synonymous, as Advax TM adjuvant comprises delta inulin of highly specific particle size and morphology, thereby distinguishing it from delta inulin more generally.",

Formulation of inactivated influenza vaccine with Advax TM enhanced serum neutralizing antibody titres in mice and provided up to 100-fold antigen sparing [41] . This correlated with a higher frequency of influenza-specific IgM-and IgG-secreting B cells in the bone marrow and spleen of immunized mice. As seen for HBsAg immunization, use of Advax TM was associated with an increase in influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proliferation and increased IFN-\u2425, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, and GM-CSF production, which translated into enhanced protection against lethal influenza challenge [41] . Immunity was long-lived with high antibody titres, T-cell responses and influenza protection still evident 1 year post-immunization with Advax TM . Injection of mice with Advax TM alone in the absence of antigen provided no protection against influenza infection, indicating that it does not induce non-specific innate immune protection. Advax TM has also been shown to boost the immunogenicity of inactivated influenza vaccine even when delivered via the intrapulmonary route [42] . Advax TM adjuvant was also tested for its ability to help overcome the effects of pregnancy-associated immune suppression on influenza vaccine responses. Advax TM adjuvant was well tolerated by pregnant dams and was not associated with any adverse reproductive or developmental effects in mothers or pups [43] . Pregnant dams that received a single intramuscular injection of inactivated influenza antigen with Advax TM adjuvant had increased serum anti-influenza IgG titres and this translated into higher anti-influenza IgG titres in their breast milk. This in turn resulted in higher anti-influenza IgG titres in the serum of their suckling pups and these pups were completely protected when challenged with influenza at 4 weeks-of-age. By contrast, no survival was seen in pups of mothers immunized with a standard unadjuvanted influenza vaccine [43] . In a ferret challenge model Advax TM adjuvant enhanced protection conferred by a licensed vaccine against high-pathogenicity avian (H5N1) influenza. Two immunizations with inactivated H5N1 antigen plus Advax TM adjuvant with or without the addition of CpG oligonucleotide induced high serum H5N1 neutralizing antibody titres whereas antibody was barely detectable in ferrets that received standard vaccine [44] . Enhanced survival, reduced clinical disease and absence of brain invasion by virus was seen in the Advax TM -adjuvanted groups with the virus being completely cleared from the nasal wash by day 4 post-challenge.",

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals gamma inulin particles to have highly variable shape, size and structure (A), potentially explaining their large batch-to-batch variation in adjuvant activity. Initial delta inulin particles had better defined structure on TEM but still exhibited considerable size variation (B). Optimization and control of crystallization parameters allowed reproducible production of delta inulin particles of consistent size and shape (C) that subsequently formed the basis of Advax TM adjuvant. Freeze-fracture scanning EM of Advax TM particles suspended in water reveals their discoid shape and formation from lamellar sheets (D and E). Atomic force microscopy of Advax TM particles during their formation confirms their discoid character and also reveals fine filament precursors from which the final delta inulin particles are assembled (F).",
