Infection of animals J Das Sarma et al with such viruses has allowed us to demonstrate that the spike gene plays a major role in the determining pathogenic outcome, including tissue tropism and virulence. An important aspect of these studies has been to observe the spread of viral antigen throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and quantify the numbers and locations of infected cells as a function of time after infection. This has been carried out by using viral speci c antibodies to detect antigen in tissue. Our goal here was to select recombinant viruses with ef cient and stable expression of a marker gene, enhanced green uorescent protein (EGFP), to facilitate the detection of spread of viruses within mice as well as to trace virus entry and spread in cell cultures.",

There are several MHV genes that have been demonstrated to be nonessential for replication in tissue culture. These include ORFs 2a (Schwarz et al, 1990) , ORFs 4a, 4b (or ORF4 in some strains) (Yokomori and Lai, 1991) , and ORF 5a (Yokomori and Lai, 1991) , which all encode small nonstructural proteins as well as the hemagglutinin-esteras e (HE) gene, which is expressed in some isolates of MHV-4, and is a pseudogene in A59 (Luytjes et al, 1988) . Recently, it has been shown that abrogation of expression of the JHM (MHV-4) ORF4 by interruption of the open reading frame does not decrease neurovirulence (Ontiveros et al, 2001) . Thus, gene 4 was chosen as a location to insert the EGFP gene. In a previous study (Fischer et al, 1997) , Masters and colleagues were able to replace gene 4 of MHV-A59 with the GFP gene; however, although mRNA encoding GFP was detected, the expression level of the protein was not suf ciently high to detect the activity by uorescent microscopy. We used a similar approach with modi cations designed to maximize expression levels. We used a modi ed version of the GFP gene, called enhanced green uorescent protein (EGFP), which has been optimized for brighter uorescence (Cormack et al, 1996) and in which codon utilization has been maximized for translation in eukaryotic cells (Haas et al, 1996) , and a modi ed EGFP donor plasmid, which results in selection of recombinant viruses with higher expression levels of the mRNA expressing EGFP.",

As described above, we chose this region of the genome because it had been previously demonstrated that expression of gene 4 is not essential for the replication of MHV in vitro (Yokomori and Lai, 1991) , nor is it essential for full neurovirulence of MHV-JHM (Ontiveros et al, 2001) . We introduced the EGFP gene into recombinant isogenic viruses differing only in the spike gene; these are S A59 R, a recombinant wildtype MHV-A59, and S 4 R, a virus with the MHV-4 spike in place of the A59 spike, with all other genes derived from MHV-A59. The EGFP-expressing viruses were selected as described in Materials and methods. Brie y, targeted recombination was carried out between synthetic capped RNAs transcribed from pMH54 EGFP and pMH54-S4 EGFP and the recipient virus fMHV, according to the scheme depicted in Figure 1 and Materials and methods. Viral plaques exhibiting green uorescence, derived from putative recombinants, were picked and plaque-puri ed twice more. Two plaque-puri ed viruses, derived from independent recombination events for each plasmid, were used for further characterization . Recombinant viruses with the A59 spike were named S A59 R EGFP-1 and S A59 R EGFP-2 and those with the MHV-4 spike were named S 4 R EGFP-1 and S 4 R EGFP-2 . Because the two viruses in each pair were identical in all ways we have examined, we will show the data, in most cases, for only one and refer to them as S A59 R EGFP and S 4 R EGFP . (We have shown previously that pairs of viruses selected this way share all in vitro and in vivo properties examined) (Leparc-Goffart et al, 1998; Phillips et al, 1999) . Similarly, parental recombinant viruses S A59 R16 (wild-type MHV-A59) and S 4 R22 (expressing the MHV-4 spike, but otherwise isogenic with S A59 R16) will be referred to as S A59 R and S 4 R, respectively.",

A primer pair (IZJ5 and IZJ6; Table 1), spanning the 3 0 portion of the N gene through the 3 0 untranslated region, and a primer pair anking the EGFP gene (pEGFP 5 0 MetI and pEGFP 3 0 NotI; Table 1 ) were used to amplify fragments of 600 and 770 base pairs, respectively, from RNA extracted from cells infected with S A59 R EGFP , S 4 R EGFP , as well as parental S A59 R and S 4 R and wild-type MHV-A59 and MHV-4. As expected, the primers in the N gene ampli ed a fragment from the RNAs of all viruses, wild-type MHV-A59 and MHV-4, recombinant parental viruses S A59 R and S 4 R, as well as EGFP-expressing viruses. The EGFP gene-speci c primers ampli ed only Figure 1 Targeted recombination scheme and the resulting EGFP-expressing viruses. The replacement of ORFs 4a and 4b with the EGFP gene was carried out within the pMH54 and pMH54-S4 plasmids and then introduced into the MHV genome using recombinant technology, all as described in the text. Panel A is a schematic of the fMHV genome; it encodes the ectodomain of the feline infectious peritonitis spike in the background of the A59 genome. Panel B shows the synthetic RNA transcribed from the vector pMH54 EGFP (A59 spike) or pMH54-S4 EGFP (MHV-4 spike). The curved line between the genome and the pMH54 RNA indicates the region in which the crossover must have occurred. The restriction sites relevant to the introduction of the EGFP gene are shown.

Total cellular RNAs prepared from mock-, MHV-A59-, S A59 R-, and S A59 R EGFP -infected cells were electrophoresed in denaturing agarose gels, blotted onto nylon membranes, and hybridized with radiolabeled probes speci c for either for the N gene or the EGFP gene (see Materials and methods). As expected, the N gene probe detected all seven MHV RNAs in cells infected by all viruses. Also as expected, the EGFP probe detected mRNAs 1 to 4, those containing the EGFP gene only in RNA from cells infected with EGFP-expressing virus ( Figure 4 ). Although mRNAs 5 to 7 of all viruses were identical in size, mRNA 4 of EGFP-expressing viruses migrated more slowly than the corresponding mRNAs from wild-type viruses. Interestingly, the levels of mRNA 4 were consistently higher in recombinant viruses as compared with wild-type parental MHV-A59 (compare lanes 2, 3, and 4, Figure 4 ). Although mRNA 4 was barely detectable in RNA from MHV-A59-infected cells (lane 2), it was abundant in RNA from either S A59 Ror S A59 R EGFP -infected cells (lanes 3 and 4). This phenomenon was observed previously with recombinant MHV-4 viruses (Ontiveros et al, 2001) ; the increased synthesis of mRNA 4 in the recombinant viruses resulted from the three nucleotide changes that were made in pMH54 in order to create an SbfI (Sse8387I) restriction site downstream of the S gene (see Materials and methods). The reason for the transcriptional up-regulation caused by these substitutions is currently unclear, but is likely helpful in achieving the desired level of EGFP expression. We next investigated the level of EGFP protein expression using immunoblots ( Figure 5 ). Protein lysates from cells infected with parental and EGFPexpressing recombinant viruses (as well as mockinfected cells) were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses, blotted onto polyvinyldene uoride (PVDF) membranes and probed with anti-EGFP (MHV RNA 7 appears to be less abundant than expected. This is probably because the gel was loaded with samples containing enough RNA to assure visualization of the larger, less abundant viral RNAs; the large amount of 18S ribosomal RNA present in these samples limits the binding of viral RNA 7 to the blot.) serum (Molecular Probe, Engene, OR) and in parallel with a monoclonal antibody directed against viral nucleocapsid (N) protein (Materials and methods). As expected, the anti-N antibodies recognized a 50-kDa band in lysates from cells infected with all viruses. (As has been observed previously [Bond et al, 1979] , the N protein of wild-type MHV-4 [lane 5] has slightly slower mobility than that of MHV-A59 or the recombinants, which all have the MHV-A59 N gene.) The anti-GFP antiserum recognized a polypeptide migrating at about 31 kDa in lysates from cells infected with EGFP-expressing viruses. Although the calculated molecular mass for monomeric EGFP is 27 kDa, the observations of a slightly slower electrophoretic mobility and the presence of other less prominent bands have been reported previously (Fischer et al, 1997) .",

Thus, we carried out intracranial inoculations of two independently isolated, clones of S A59 R EGFP (S A59 R EGFP-1 and S A59 R EGFP-2 ) and S A59 R at 10 4 plaque-forming unit (PFU)/mouse and measured virus replication in the brains as a function of time after infection.

(The differences in titer observed between S A59 R and S A59 R EGFP-1 or S A59 R EGFP-2 were statistically signi cantly at days 1 and 5.) We carried out similar infections with S 4 R and S 4 R EGFP in which we titered virus from brains at 5 days post infection. Similar to the result obtained for S A59 R and S A59 R EGFP , S 4 R EGFP replicated to a titer approximately 10-fold less than S 4 R.

In order to determine whether this difference in spread of viral antigen was also a property for the EGFP-expressing viruses derived from S A59 R and S 4 R, we compared the spread of S A59 R EGFP and S 4 R EGFP in the CNS. Frozen sagittal brain sections, from the same animals described above, were post xed and examined for EGFP uorescence by microscopy as described in Materials and methods. EGFP was detected in discrete foci in the same regions of the brain in mice infected by both EGFPexpressing viruses as reported previously for parental viruses S A59 R and S 4 R. (We examined at least three sections from two animals infected with each virus.) There were no detectable differences in the regional location of viral antigen expression in the brain (Phillips et al, 1999) . Areas of viral antigen-positive cells for both viruses included the olfactory bulbs, mid brain, cortex, subiculum, basal forebrain structures, and regions of the brainstem. Figure 8 shows an example of a portion of sagittal sections cut from the middle of the brains of animals infected with S A59 R EGFP and S 4 R EGFP at the peak of viral antigen expression, day 5.

            "text": "Our approach to expressing EGFP from the MHV genome was to select recombinant viruses in which nonstructural gene 4 has been replaced with the EGFP gene. We used this strategy because gene 4 is not essential for replication in tissue culture (Yokomori and Lai, 1991) nor for wild-type levels of neurovirulence (Ontiveros et al, 2001) . Furthermore, Fischer et al (1997) had been able to introduce the GFP gene into gene 4 and observe transcription of an mRNA encoding GFP and to detect the protein by Western blot; however, this recombinant virus was not useful for studies of viral spread because the levels of GFP expression were not high enough to detect by uorescence microscopy. We were able to achieve a signi cantly higher level of expression than that observed by Fischer et al (1997) , enough to easily detect by uorescence microscopy, both in infected cells in culture and in mice. This increased activity was a result of two factors. First, we used a modi ed GFP gene, EGFP (Clontech catalogue 6085-1) that encodes a red-shifted variant of wild-type GFP and has been optimized for brighter uorescence (Cormack et al, 1996) and in which codon utilization has been maximized for translation in mammalian cells (Haas et al, 1996) . The second factor is an unexplained increase in transcription of mRNA 4 that occurs when recombinant viruses are selected using derivatives of plasmid pMH54 in which an SbfI site has been introduced (by silent mutations) into the region between the spike gene and gene 4 (Figure 1 ). This phenomenon, previously reported by Ontiveros et al (2001) , can be observed in the comparison of expression of mRNA 4 from wild-type viruses A59 and MHV-4 and all of the recombinant viruses whether or not they express EGFP (Figure 4) . We ampli ed and sequenced the 5 0 end of the mRNA4/EGFP from S A59 R EGFP . This consensus sequence contained the 5 0 MHV-A59 leader sequence, followed by the intergenic sequence between spike and gene 4, followed by the EGFP gene. This was consistent with transcription of one major mRNA in the region of mRNA 4; we did not detect additional mRNAs encoding the EGFP gene, as was reported in a previous study (Fischer et al, 1997) .",

This was of concern, as the EGFP-expressing viruses replicate slightly less ef ciently as parental viruses and show some attenuation in virulence in mice; we, thus, reasoned that replication in vitro and or in mice may select for virus in which the EGFP gene has been deleted. Nearly all the plaques examined over six passages of virus in tissue culture retain EGFP uorescence. Furthermore, nearly all plaques isolated from the brains of infected mice at 5 days post infection are still expressing EGFP. Thus, expression of the EGFP gene remains stable through in vitro passage and during acute infection in the murine CNS. Interestingly, the majority of plaques recovered from the liver during actue infection were negative for EGFP activity. A similar organ-speci c loss of a foreign sequence was reported by Slifka et al (2001) . In this study, insertion of a foreign sequence from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) into a recombinant coxsackievirus resulted in a virus that frequently deleted the LCMV sequence after inoculation into animals; the foreign sequences were lost more frequently in virus isolated from the heart whereas viruses isolated from the pancreas were more likely to retain the LCMV sequence (Slifka et al, 2001) .",

This is not due to the disruption of gene 4, as it has been demonstrated that inactivation of gene 4 expression by the introduction of three nucleotide substitutions does not reduce replication of MHV-JHM in vitro nor does it reduce neurovirulence (Ontiveros et al, 2001) . Thus it is likely that insertion of the EGFP gene (which is longer than ORF 4) confers a disadvantage to the virus, possibly because the EGFP gene alters the local structure of the RNA, thereby causing a slight disadvantage in replication that results in reduction in pathogenesis. As shown in Figure 7 , there is a small but signi cant difference in replication of S A59 R EGFP , as compared with S A59 R, in the mouse CNS. It is also possible, but less likely, that expression of EGFP itself may attenuate the EGFP-expressing viruses.",

Thus, we compared such viruses tagged with EGFP in infection and spread of virus in the CNS. EGFP-expressing viruses, expressing either the MHV-4 or A59 spike proteins, replicate ef ciently in the CNS and induce encephalitis. At least in the case of S A59 R EGFP , demyelination was also detected. (We did not examine demyelination for S 4 R EGFP .) The spread of the EGFP-expressing viruses within the CNS was similar to that reported for the parental viruses. Encephalitis was focal, with similar regions of involvement as previously reported (Phillips et al, 1999) .

In order to replace gene 4 with the EGFP gene, pMH54 was modi ed by the introduction of a SalI site 42 nucleotides downstream of the intergenic sequence for gene 4a and a NotI site 102 bp upstream of the stop codon for gene 4b, using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). (These are coding-silent nucleotide changes.) The coding sequence of EGFP was cleaved from the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using SalI and NotI and inserted in the place of the SalI/NotI fragment of pMH54. The resulting plasmid contains 760 bp of non-MHV sequence, including the 722-bp EGFP open reading frame, replacing the entire gene 4a and the rst 213 bp of gene 4b. Then, to insert the EGFP fragment into the original unmodi ed pMH54 plasmid, a 1450-bp fragment of the EGFP-containing pMH54 was cleaved with SbfI (after the stop codon of the spike gene) and EcoRV at the 3 0 end of ORF 5b, the E gene, and inserted it into the corresponding sites in pMH54; the nal plasmid was called pMH54 EGFP . Finally, the 1450-nucleotide SbfI/EcoRV fragment of this construct was sequenced (Sanger et al, 1977) . To construct a similar plasmid differing only in the spike gene (called pMH54-S4 EGFP ), the MHV-4 spike gene was cleaved with AvrII and SbfI from pGEM-S4 (Phillips et al, 1999) and inserted into pMH54 EGFP in place of the A59 spike gene. For RNA transcription, the designated pMH54-derived plasmids were linearized just 3 0 to the poly(A) tail by digestion with PacI. The EGFP gene/viral junctions were sequenced in both pMH54 EGFP and pMH54-S4 EGFP using the primers FIJ81, FIJ83, RIJ84, and RIJ86 (Table 1) and the Taq dye terminator procedure (Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).",

Recombinant viruses in which the murine coronavirus spike gene has replaced the feline coronavirus spike gene were selected by replication in murine 17Cl-1 cells (Phillips et al, 2001; Kuo et al, 2000) . Candidate recombinants were plaque puri ed two times, and viral stocks were grown on 17Cl-1 cells for further characterization . For each desired recombinant, at least two viruses derived from independent recombination events were characterized . The viruses with the A59 spike were called S A59 R EGFP and those with the MHV-4 spike were called S 4 R EGFP . Although each individual virus was given a number, such as S A59 R EGFP-1 or S 4 R EGFP-1 , they will be referred to here more simply as S A59 R EGFP or S 4 R EGFP .",

Probes were labeled using the Ready To Go DNA labeling beads (Pharmacia, Peapack, NJ) in which DNA was randomly primed. Template for the EGFP probe was NotI-digested EGFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), DNA and template for nucleocapsid probe was PstI-digested pGEM 320 (Gombold and Weiss, 1992) .

On days 1, 3, 5, and 7 post infection, mice were sacri ced, perfused with 10 ml of PBS, and the brains and livers were removed. The left half of the brain and most of the liver were placed directly into 2 ml of isotonic saline with 0.167% gelatin (gel saline). (The rest of the brain and liver were used for histology.) All organs were weighed and stored frozen at \u00a180 \u00b1 C until titered for virus. Brains were homogenized, and virus titers were determined by plaque assay on L2 cell monolayers (Phillips et al, 1999) .For analysis of EGFP uorescence, frozen sections had to be used rather than paraf n-embedded sections, because paraf n-embedded sections exhibited high amounts of auto uorescence. Thus, the rest of the brain (right half) and liver fragments from infected mice (see above) were xed overnight in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissues were subsequently washed for 1 h in PBS, 4 h in 5% sucrose, and then overnight in 20% sucrose, then embedded in OCT medium (Tissue Tek) and sectioned sagitally with a microtome to 4 \u00b9m thickness and mounted on slides. Some sections were stained with H&E while others were left unstained for EGFP detection. For EGFP auto uorescence sections were xed in ice-cold 95% ethanol for 20 min, incubated at room temperature, in ice-cold PBS for 10 min, and then mounted on 4.8% MOWIOL in 50% glycerol. Slides were visualized by uorescence microscopy using an Olympus X-70 microscope system with a 10\u00a3 long-working-distance UPlanFl phase objective (0.3 na) and a lter pack suitable for EGFP (U-MWIBA BP460-490 j DM505 j BA515-550) uorescence. Images were acquired with a Hammatzu Orca-1 CCD camera and Image Pro image analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). To create a composite image of a tissue section, partially overlapping images were obtained from sequential elds and then manually combined to form a complete image with Adobe Photoshop. To quantify the level of EGFP expression, regions of the image containing pixel values between 128 and 255 were automatically identi ed using Image Pro, subject to a threshold maximum area/feature to avoid quantifying auto uorescent regions, such as folds in the tissue slice. The sum total of pixels in this intensity range was then obtained using Image Pro. The intensity range was then increased to a broader range (25 to 255) to enable the software to identify the entire tissue slice as a region of interest to get the total area of the tissue slice in pixels. The relative level of expression was then calculated as EGFP pixels/total pixels for a given image. For assessment of the demyelination, mice were infected intracranially with 5 \u00a3 10 4 PFU per mouse. At 30 days postinfection, infected mice were sacri ced, perfused with PBS, followed by 10% phosphate-buffered formalin.
