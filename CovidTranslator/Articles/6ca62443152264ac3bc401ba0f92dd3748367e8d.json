By contrast, loss of immunity is often highlighted by cerebral infections. To protect this vital system, the healthy brain and spinal cord are under continual immune surveillance to detect and eliminate potential mediators of infection and damage. Both resident microglia and immune cells from the general circulation function as primary guardians of the CNS, and their sentinel duties contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis and thus optimal functioning of the brain and spinal cord.",

In addition to microglia, peripheral immune cells can enter the uninflamed CNS through mechanisms similar to those in peripheral organs, albeit at a lower rate. For instance, the number of T cells that travel into the CNS is small, as these cells partake in intermittent, transient interactions with CNS endothelium through cell adhesion molecules that are themselves expressed at one-tenth of the level of that in other organs 1 . Basal interaction of leukocytes (rolling) in brain is also one-tenth of that seen in other organs 1 . Other immune cells of peripheral origin, such as perivascular macrophages and meningeal dendritic cells, are strategically located at the interface between the blood and brain, where they can sample the environment for foreign antigens and promote antigen presentation should a florid inflammatory response be necessary 2 . Here, we summarize knowledge of how microglia and peripheral immune cells participate in promoting physiological balance and protection of the normal CNS and how interruption of immune patrol of the brain and spinal cord can lead to and/or augment disease and injury.",

            "text": "Microglia mediate surveillance and homeostasis in the CNS Even though they share surface markers with hematogenously derived macrophages 3 , it has recently been shown that one subset of microglia is separately derived from the yolk sac, with progenitors invading the CNS at approximately the tenth day of development in mice 4-6 . After birth, another subset of microglia appears to be bone marrow derived, with distinct function(s) 7 . A large body of work demonstrates that microglial cells are vital in maintaining homeostasis in the CNS. They are critical in synapse maintenance and turnover in the adult CNS 8 and may provide trophic support to neurons and macroglia through their secretion of neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3 (NT3) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). These factors have been shown to protect and regulate the survival and regeneration of neuronal cells 9 . Microglia can take up neurotransmitters such as glutamate through cytokine-mediated mechnisms 10 and are the primary cell type involved in phagocytosis and clearance of myelin inhibitors, debris and dead cells in the CNS. Even a function in the enhancement of remyelination, oligodendrogenesis and angiogenesis has been documented 11, 12 . Together, these critical functions of microglia facilitate and promote equilibrium and optimal functioning of the CNS.",

We discuss the physiological roles of the immune sentinels that patrol the CNS, the molecular markers that underlie their surveillance duties, and the consequences of interrupting their functions following injury and infection by viruses such as JC virus, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus and West Nile virus. r e v i e w human brain 15 and MHC II in the rodent brain 16 , observations that imply a capability for antigen presentation and thus a function in immune surveillance of the brain. Indeed, the molecular markers of antigen presentation and activation, such as MHC II, CD80, CD86, CD40, CD11a, CD54 and CD58 (refs. 17,18) , are rapidly augmented on microglia in response to even minor pathological changes in the CNS, and these cells are capable of presenting antigens to, and activating, T cells 19 . Specifically, in infectious models such as coronavirusinduced mouse hepatitis, upregulation of MHC I by microglia is postulated to reflect a vigilant state of these cells enabling them to present antigen to and engage CD8 + T cells early after infection 20 . Also, competent presentation of antigen to CD4 + T cells through MHC I and II on microglia 21 during Theiler's murine encephalitis virus infection likely reflects an effort to clear the virus.",

Indeed, intraventricular administration of lipopolysaccharide rapidly induces a macrophage-like response with the release of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1, interferons (IFNs) and others) and the production of many chemokines and chemoattractants that alert and recruit more immune cells to the brain. Bacterial meningitis, much like lipopolysaccharide administration, directly activates microglia, which release cytokines and chemokines that attract peripheral immune cells. The exuberant response that ensues likely contributes to the morbidity and mortality of this cerebral infection. However, some pathogens find refuge in the brain and do not appear to cause an immune response. As one example, Cryptococcus neoformans infiltrates the brains of HIV patients who have low T cell counts 22 . Although one could argue that this might be because the microglia are also immunocompromised, C. gattii, which has in the last 10 years emerged in North America, infiltrates the brains of immunocompetent humans with minimal signs of inflammation early in disease 23 .",

            "text": "Although a robust immune response can be mounted in the CNS, this vital organ is normally quiescent, with cellular components of the CNS mediating immunosuppression. For example, in the intact CNS, microglia are kept in a quiescent state by interactions between the neuronal CD200 receptor and the CD200 ligand on microglia. This was demonstrated directly in CD200-deficient mice, in which microglia spontaneously exhibit features of activation such as less ramified morphology and increase expression of CD11b and CD45 (ref. 24 ). Further, it has been reported that electrical activity of neurons may also suppress MHC expression in surrounding microglia and astrocytes, as paralysis of neuronal signaling by tetrodotoxin correlates with augmented interferon-\u03b3-induced expression of MHC II on these glia 25 . In addition to neuronal activity, neuronally derived neurotrophins such as NGF, NT3 and BDNF have been demonstrated to dampen MHC I expression (critical for viral detection by CD8 + T cells) on microglia in brain slices or cultures 26 , and NGF inhibits expression of the costimulatory molecule B7-2 (CD86) and CD40 in cultured rat microglia 27 . Of note, resting microglia in old mice were recently found to possess less elaborate dendritic arbors concomitant with slower process movements and retarded migratory ability that may compromise their surveying ability and injury response 28 . This may explain the age-related increase in susceptibility to cerebral infection. In addition to keeping vigilance at low levels, suppressive mechanisms may also be ramped up to allow restitution of an immune response. However, the dominant mechanisms of restitution identified thus far involve molecules such as TGF-\u03b2 secreted by astrocytes that downregulate the secretion of the proinflammatory molecules inducible nitric oxide synthase and IL-2 by activated microglia 29, 30 . Increased production of microglial IL-10 also has been shown to dampen immune responses in the brain in an autoregulatory manner 29 .",

Of interest, Loeffler and colleagues 31 have showed that cellular immune surveillance in the healthy human brain differs among CNS regions. As expected, the highest numbers of immune cells are located in brain areas where the tight junction barrier of the BBB is reduced, such as the area postrema of the circumventricular organs and the ventrorostral areas of the medulla oblongata. Not all studies agree with a population of CD4 + T cells in the healthy human brain. At least two npg r e v i e w separate groups have instead identified CD3 + CD8 + granzymeB \u2212 perforin \u2212 lymphocytes and, to a limited extent, CD20 + B cells as the main cellular components 39, 40 .",

Capture and adherence of activated T H 1 T cells to CNS venules were demonstrated to occur via interactions between VLA-4 on T H 1 cells and VCAM-1 on endothelial cells, whereas diapedesis of T H 1 cells across the venule wall is facilitated by leukocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1 (ref. 41 ). Further, T H 17 cell migration across the blood-CSF barrier in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis, has been shown to depend on the chemokine receptor CCR6 on T H 17 T cells, which binds its ligand CCL20 that is constitutively produced by the choroid plexus epithelium 42 . However, other studies have shown enhanced EAE clinical symptoms in CCR6-null mice during the chronic disease phase that is associated with a lack of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1-expressing myeloid dendritic cells in spleen 43 and reduced numbers of CD4 + T regulatory cells in the CNS 44 . It is likely that many chemokine receptors function in various immune cells in EAE and their action may vary depending on the stage of the disease. Very recently, a new pathway of T cell entry into the CNS of EAE mice was identified. Arima and colleagues 45 have reported that the earliest CNS entry of CD4 + T cells in EAE occurs at a very specific site: the fifth lumbar level of the spinal cord. They observed high CCL20 chemokine expression in the dorsal root vessels. This was associated with sensory neurons that innervate the soleus and other leg muscles, and silencing of these neural pathways reduced chemokine expression and, ultimately, T cell recruitment into the spinal cord.",

These cells are continuously replaced by monocytes, as demonstrated by bone marrow chimera studies in rodents 46, 47 and transplantation studies in humans 48 that show a steady rate of perivascular cell turnover in the normal, uninflamed CNS. With their close association to the vessels in the CNS, perivascular cells have been speculated to continually scan and sample the CSF 49,50 and may therefore be capable of detecting infectious agents early. They are capable of phagocytosing molecules from the CSF 49 , and in humans perivascular cells constitutively express MHC II, CD4, B7 and the chemokine receptors CCR3, CCR5 and CXCR4 (refs. 36,51) , all of which likely contribute to the ability of these cells to potently and efficiently present antigen to T cells 46 . There is controversy as to whether perivascular cells re-enter the peripheral immune circuitry to instigate a peripheral immune reaction because direct implantation of antigens into the CNS has failed to elicit a peripheral immune response 52 . However, Cserr and colleagues 53 demonstrated that CNS-derived antigens can drain to deep cervical lymph nodes that could potentially make CNS antigens available to the peripheral immune system. The recent finding that monocytes injected into the brain reach lymphatic organs by way of the cribroid plate 54 lends credence to this idea. Perivascular cells may contribute to disease pathogenesis, such as that in multiple sclerosis and EAE, where they are implicated in reactivation of encephalitogenic T cells entering the CNS 55 . Indeed, specific elimination of monocytes markedly ameliorates clinical symptoms of EAE 56 .",

Dendritic cells are potent antigen-presenting cells to, and activators of, CD4 + T cells 55 and may therefore contribute to CNS immune surveillance. There is some evidence that dendritic cells can traffic to peripheral lymphoid organs and possibly present any antigens detected in the CNS to T cells in the periphery. Specifically, dendritic cells that were injected into CSF have been detected in B cell follicles of cervical lymph nodes 60 . The number of dendritic cells increases markedly in the perivascular space, as well as the parenchyma of the CNS in humans and animals, after CNS infection 61 ; in diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 62 , multiple sclerosis and EAE 55 ; and after ischemic injury and kainic acid-induced excitotoxicity 63 . Although these cells help clear foreign antigen, the proinflammatory mediators secreted by dendritic cells, perivascular cells and T cells can contribute to disease progression or injury, and thus the function of these cells must remain under strict control. One mechanism that may contribute to suppressing immune reactions in the CNS is constitutive expression of Fas ligand on neurons that promote Fas-mediated death of CNS-infiltrating immune cells 64 .",

            "text": "The consequences of interrupting immune surveillance in the CNS have never been more evident than in the case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a usually fatal CNS infection caused by JCV. Approximately 80% of humans harbor JCV that resides latently in bone marrow and renal tubular epithelial cells and B cells. PML is often a consequence of therapies designed to prevent attacks by immune cells on the CNS. Upon suppression of CD4 + and CD8 + T cell mobilization, as occurs with HIV infection, chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy, the virus enters the brain, either within B cells or as cell-free virus, where it infects and kills oligodendrocytes, leading to demyelination 65, 66 . There are no treatments for PML, and most patients either die or are left with severe disability. Armed with the knowledge that immune cells utilize cell adhesion molecules to infiltrate the CNS in inflammatory diseases, monoclonal antibodies against B cells (rituximab), VLA-4 (natalizumab) and LFA-1 (efalizumab) had been developed to treat multiple sclerosis, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. These medications inhibit migration of B and T cells into the CNS 67 . As a result, the lack of surveillance normally imposed by the immune system allows unabated invasion of the pathogen into the brain. Like JCV, HSV-1 is rampant in the human population but normally remains quiescent in neurons after initial infection of peripheral epithelial cells 68 . Various antiviral responses are mounted by the host's innate and adaptive immune systems to maintain the dormant state of the virus 69 . For example, recognition of HSV-1 pathogen-associated molecular patterns by toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 or TLR9 on microglial cells results in the secretion of type I IFNs, IL-15, TNF and the chemokine CCL2 (ref. 70) , which recruits macrophages, and type I IFN production by neurons and microglia is further augmented in a TLR3dependent mechanism. TLR3 expression by microglia and astrocytes may participate in controlling CNS invasion of HSV. Notably, children with a dominant negative TLR3 allele can develop HSV-1 encephalitis 71 . The IFNs contribute to an antiviral response by inducing RNase L and IFN-induced double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase expression, which respectively result in degradation of mRNA and cessation of translation 69 . The adaptive immune system also helps control HSV-1 and maintain its latency. The production of TNF, nitric oxide and IFN-\u03b3 by CNS infiltrating macrophages and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells is associated with control of viral replication, and CD8 + T cells inhibit HSV-1 reactivation through MHC class I-and granzyme B-dependent mechanisms 68, 72 .

WNV is a mosquito-transmitted, single-stranded RNA virus that can infect and damage neurons, but most infections in humans are asymptomatic 83, 84 , a phenomenon that is attributed to immunity in the brain that suppresses WNV infection. The current thinking is that, through TLR7 recognition of viral RNA, microglia initially sense that WNV has invaded the CNS. This results in secretion of IL-23, which promotes infiltration into the CNS of monocytes and macrophages, CD4 + T cells 85, 86 , CD8 + T cells 87 , natural killer T cells, dendritic cells and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells 88 . The robust immune response participates in neutralizing the virus and limiting viral infectivity, likely in a CCR5-mediated mechanism, as CCR5-deficient mice are more susceptible than their wild-type counterparts to lethal WNV encephalitis, which correlates with increased brain viral burden and markedly reduced brain leukocyte traffic 89 . Other studies show that CXCL12-CXCR4 interactions appear to promote CNS migration of monocytes and CD8 + T cells, which is associated with neutralization of the virus and increased survival of the host 90 , and that CXCL10 secretion by infected cerebellar neurons recruits CXCR3-expressing CD8 + T cells that promote viral clearance 91 .",

Trauma to, and diseases of, the brain and spinal cord can elicit or dampen immune responses that can determine whether the outcome is damaging or protective. For instance, the lack of long distance regeneration of injured axons after spinal cord injury has in part been attributed to an insubstantial immune reaction. Specifically, in comparison to the robust immune reaction following peripheral nerve injury, the response of innate immune cells such as microglia and monocytes in the damaged CNS is weak, and this likely contributes to the delay in phagocytosis of myelin debris and thus prolonged presence of myelin-associated inhibitors of neurite outgrowth. An augmentation of macrophage and microglial activation has been associated with enhanced regeneration of injured CNS axons that was attributed to increased phagocytosis of, and thus faster clearance, of myelin and its axon growth inhibitors, as well as the production by these innate cells of cytokines and growth factors that can support neuron survival, oligodendrogenesis, remyelination and angiogenesis 11, 12 . In addition, enhancing CNS influx of T cells has been shown to promote CNS regeneration by stimulating microglial phagocytosis; buffering glutamate, thereby preventing excitoxicity 92 ; and secreting neurotrophins to protect neurons from secondary degeneration 93 .",

In addition, molecules modified by oxidation or proteolytic cleavage, such as collagen and hyaluronan, or precipitates such as uric acid crystals have been shown to activate the innate immune system. In the case of ATP, the activation occurs through the purinergic receptor P2X7, which activates NOD-like receptors, including NLRP-3, which activates caspase and IL-1 and npg r e v i e w induces inflammation. In addition to these molecules, mitochondrial peptides that have bacterial motifs (formylated peptides) activate the formylated peptide receptors found on neutrophils and other immune cells, inducing potent chemotaxis 94 .

Reprints and permissions information is available online at http://www.nature.com/ reprints/index.html.Corrigendum: Immune surveillance in the central nervous system In the version of this article initially published, the figure that depicted the main sites of immune cell entry into the brain parenchyma contained some anatomical details that we felt might lead to confusion among the nonspecialist readership. The central region of the brain parenchyma was unlabeled and not colored as parenchyma, and the subarachnoid space that surrounds the cerebellum was not indicated. These omissions have been rectified. In addition, the folded epithelial cell layer lining the choroid plexus had been depicted projecting into the unlabeled central region. We now show this cell layer extending into the ventricle. The figure legend has also been updated to indicate that cells reach the CSF in the first route by crossing through the fenestrated blood vessels of the choroid plexus. The errors have been corrected in the HTML and PDF versions of the article. npg",
