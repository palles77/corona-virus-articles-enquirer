We will examine them through the lens of the legal issues they raise. In particular, we focus on three topics: the legal and ethical principles for approaching the problem of how to ration and distribute medications when there is not enough to treat everyone in the population; how a mass quarantine in today's society could be effective and what its cost would be; and the questions raised by the possibility of imposing domestic and international travel restrictions. We will begin by describing the most important underlying facts related to bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases.",

Increased and sometimes imprudent use of antimicrobial drugs and pesticides has led to the development of resistant pathogens, allowing many diseases that were formerly treatable with drugs to make a comeback (e.g., tuberculosis, malaria, nosocomial [resulting from hospital care], and food-borne infections). Recently, decreased compliance with vaccination policy has also led to re-emergence of diseases such as measles and pertussis, which were previously under control. The main way that SARS seems to spread is by close personto-person contact. The virus that causes SARS is thought to be transmitted most readily by respiratory droplets (droplet spread) produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Droplet spread can happen when droplets from the cough or sneeze of an infected person are propelled a short distance (generally up to 3 feet) through the air and deposited on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons who are nearby. The virus also can spread when a person touches a surface or object contaminated with infectious droplets and then touches his or her mouth, nose, or eye(s). In addition, it is possible that the SARS virus might spread more broadly through the air (airborne spread) or by other ways that are not now known.",

Scientists anticipate that if a new strain of influenza takes hold in humans, it will take several months to develop and produce a drug that can counteract it. for anthrax or smallpox, there are pharmaceutical countermeasures available, but the initially available quantities may be inadequate. States have developed plans to coordinate with federal public health authorities to disseminate \"push packs\" of existing drugs from the Strategic national Stockpile (SnS) managed by the CDC. The SnS is a national repository of antibiotics, chemical antidotes, antitoxins, lifesupport medications, IV administration, airway maintenance supplies, and medical/surgical items. Push packs contain pharmaceuticals, antidotes, and medical supplies designed to provide rapid delivery of medical resources in the early hours of a public health emergency. Push packs are stored in strategically located, secure warehouses, and can be delivered within 12 hours after a state's request. It is then up to state and local health officials to distribute them in the affected areas. If the cause of the disease is quickly identified and there are known medications, the SnS program will arrange shipping of pharmaceutical products specific to that disease.",
