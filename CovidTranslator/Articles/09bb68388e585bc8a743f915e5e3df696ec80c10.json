The challenge often faced with reproductive emergencies is how to preserve the life of the patient and maximize the chance to maintain reproductive ability. In camelids, this is even more important, as assisted reproductive technologies have either not yet been perfected (semen preservation, in vitro embryo production, nuclear transfer) or are not allowed (embryo transfer) by some breed registries. In the case of pregnant females, which constitute the majority of reproductive emergencies, the life and welfare of the neonate must also be considered. The objective of the present paper is to review the most common reproductive emergencies in male, female, and neonatal camelids. This review draws primarily on the clinical experience of the authors, as there are very limited controlled studies regarding clinical reproduction and emergency care in camelids.",

Reproductive emergencies in the male camelid are primarily due to sudden onset of visible abnormalities in the external genitalia. These abnormalities can be summarized as acute scrotal or preputial swelling, preputial prolapse or paraphymosis, and post-surgical emergencies [1] [2] [3] . In camels, preputial swelling is also a primary clinical sign of acute trypanosomiasis, a disease with high morbidity and mortality in many countries where camel breeding is important [3] . www.theriojournal.com 2.1. General approach to examination of the male for reproductive emergency As with any other emergency, accurate body weight, body condition score, physical examination, degree of dehydration, baseline complete blood count (CBC), blood biochemistry, and urinalysis should be part of the initial evaluation. Immediate placement of an intravenous catheter is indicated in severely compromised or recumbent animals. Ultrasonography of the urogenital organs should also be conducted.",

Pulmonary edema is a serious risk if fluids are administered too fast (>20 mL/ kg/h). Palliative therapies against other complications should include nasal oxygen insufflation in hypoxemic patients, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; e.g. flunixin meglumine), antioxidants (vitamin E and selenium), and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Some males may show increased straining to defecate, odontoprisis, inappetence and ileus, followed by anorexia, frequent unsuccessful attempts at micturition or dribbling blood tinged urine, and signs of abdominal discomfort [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

The initial treatment is to replace viable prolapsed preputial mucosa and maintain it in place with a purse string suture. Daily cleaning of the sheath with saline, and application of local anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial ointment (petercillin) for 3-5 days will reduce the chance of further complications. Sutures may be removed after 7-10 days. Excessive preputial prolapse with slight necrosis requires circumferential resection and anastomosis of the prepuce.

Furthermore, permanent exteriorization of the soft palate during the rut season is a common in the dromedary. This usually starts with an impaction of the diverticulum with food or a foreign body [20, 21] . Part of the impacted soft palate becomes trapped under the molars and is traumatized during mastication. Traumatic lesions of the soft palate range in severity from superficial cuts and bruises to severe lacerations accompanied by hemorrhage; these lesions are rapidly complicated by infection and development of severe inflammation and edema. Formation of large abscesses is not uncommon. In most cases, the inflamed organ is permanently hanging from the side of the mouth and becomes progressively necrotic [22] [23] [24] . In a few cases, the soft palate is swollen, but not exteriorized, and blocks air exchange, which may lead to asphyxiation. If the condition is not treated, the animals become emaciated due to dysphagia and impairment of mastication and deglutition. Management of these cases requires surgical ablation of the soft palate [20] . Surgical excision of the soft palate can be performed under heavy sedation and a local block. Large vessels are ligated with resorbable suture material. Laser ablation is the best approach. Postsurgical management includes administration of NSAIDs, antimicrobials, and tetanus prophylaxis. Animals should be on soft feed for at least 3-4 days after surgery.",

Since the distance between the anus and the peritoneal reflection is very short (2-3 cm in alpacas, 4 cm in llamas, and 6-10 cm in camel), complete rectal tears in camelids are rapidly complicated by peritonitis.

Animals with evidence of peritonitis should be immediately prepared for surgical correction by celiotomy or celiotomy and pubic symphysiotomy to allow peritoneal lavage. Stable patients without alarming changes in their blood and peritoneal fluid characteristics may be further evaluated under epidural anesthesia to decide if a transanal repair is possible. Evaluation of the injury can be performed under general anesthesia. The anal sphincter is dilated using stay sutures on the mucocutaneous junction. Gentle evacuation of the rectal cavity may be attempted by low-power vacuum aspiration until the lesions can be visualized. Use of a flexible videoendoscope can facilitate this evaluation. In llamas and camels, lacerations due to transrectal palpation are usually located in the ventral aspect of the rectum, 5-20 cm anterior to the anus. However, in alpacas, particularly when the perforation has occurred with a transducer mounted on an extension, the lesion can be dorsal. Also, in these cases, the presence of more than one perforation is possible, perhaps due to faulty alignment between the extremity of the transducer and the extension rod. Transanal repair is successful if the laceration is not deep [28] . Celiotomy with pubic symphysiotomy is the only option for caudal injuries and in particular for alpacas.

For complete imaging of abdominal contents, the lower abdomen should be clipped and cleaned with alcohol from the xyphoid region to the base of the mammary gland. The area to be examined may need to be extended dorsally to the flank in order to visualize the dorsal aspect of the abdomen and the kidneys. Cranially, the projection area of the liver may also need to be prepared for examination. For transabdominal ultrasonography, a 5 MHz linear-array transducer may be sufficient for mid-pregnancy and in small patients, whereas in the last trimester, the use of a 2.5-3.5 MHz sector transducer provides better penetration and imaging of the abdomen.

The primary objective of transrectal palpation is to determine the location and direction of the broad ligaments and evaluate the caudal abdomen for any masses or abnormalities of the pelvic area, kidneys, and urinary bladder.

Unfortunately, there is a paucity of information regarding fetal biophysical characteristics in camelids. However, based on clinical experience in the authors' laboratory, the two main indicators for fetal distress are fetal heart rate and rhythm. Normal fetal heart rate in mid-to late-pregnancy range from 1.6 to 1.8 times that of the dam. In that regard, fetal heart rate is usually 80-115 bpm in the last trimester of pregnancy, but decreases to 80 bpm a few days before parturition. Fetal heart rates that are consistently >130 or <50 bpm suggest fetal distress. The fetal heart rhythm should be regular and respond to phase of activity by a 10-20% increase in rate. Fetal activity is maximal in the first half of pregnancy, but substantially reduced in the last 2 months. The entire fetus should be examined to determine fetal position and number. Normal fetal positioning for parturition appears to occur a few hours before parturition. It is not uncommon to image the fetus low in the abdomen with the dorsum against the diaphragm and all limbs pointing to the pelvic area. Transverse position of the fetus in the abdomen does not mean a transverse position inside the horn, but rather reflects the position of the entire pregnant horn. That the fetus is entirely in the left horn and the special arrangement of the pregnant horn vis-\u00e0-vis the abdominal viscera may contribute to signs of discomfort in some females in late pregnancy. Late in pregnancy, the presence of twins is best confirmed by abdominal radiography [31] .",

Clockwise torsion is indicated if the left broad ligament is stretched across midline to the right and over the uterus, whereas the right ligament is shorter and pulled ventrally and medially under the uterus. Palpation of the broad ligament may elicit a severe painful reaction. Difficulties encountered in transrectal evaluation for uterine torsion include physical limitations, particularly in alpacas (tight anal sphincter, narrow pelvis and size of the examiner's hand and arm), as well as a lack of experience palpating late-pregnant camelids in a sternal position. Although diagnosis by vaginal palpation has been reported by practitioners, in our experience, it is not reliable unless the torsion includes the cervix. With a severe colic, a definitive diagnosis may not be possible until exploratory laparotomy. Alternatively, the female could be palpated under general anesthesia, which provides greater relaxation of the anal sphincter and perineal area [39] . Transrectal ultrasonography may sometimes reveal increased dilation of the blood vessels. Although it was reported that the majority (>90%) of camelid uterine torsions are clockwise [38] , this has not been our experience; therefore, direction of the torsion needs to be ascertained before attempting nonsurgical correction.",

Rolling should be considered only if the uterus and its vasculature are not compromised. Rolling may be performed done under general anesthesia, sedation, or without sedation. The female is placed on lateral recumbency on the side of the direction of the torsion and rolled while the fetus is maintained in position with a small plank or with the fists [31, 38] . The pain usually disappears immediately after correction of the torsion and females may return to normal activity immediately. However, if they have been anorexic, correction of metabolic disorders should included in post-surgical management. Surgical correction may be performed following flank or midline laparotomy. Midline laparotomy is the preferred method in late pregnancy [39] [40] [41] [42] . The success rate of both rolling and surgical correction is very high, as is survival of the fetus. No special management is needed if the torsion has been diagnosed and corrected early. However, anorexia and pain may cause hepatic lipidosis, in which case the patient should be placed on broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy [39] . Monitoring blood progesterone is useful, particularly if an assay is readily available. The need for progesterone supplementation after correction of a torsion remains controversial.",

In addition to determining the primary cause of these disorders and assessing the chances for survival of the female, determination of fetal well-being and the possibility of induction of abortion or parturition should be contemplated. Abortion can be induced with the prostaglandin F 2a analogue, cloprostenol (250 mg in llamas and alpacas, and 500 mg in camels). The same dose is sufficient for induction of parturition, with good neonatal survival at >330 days of pregnancy and sufficient mammary gland development and colostrum production. Abortion or parturition occurs approximately 18-22 h after prostaglandin treatment. In a few situations, a second treatment with a prostaglandin F 2a analogue is necessary [45] [46] [47] .

This makes the drug ideal for induction of anesthesia for cesarean section or for surgical management of uterine torsion. Propofol decreased myometrial activity in the gravid ovine uterus in vivo [56] and in uterine muscle from gravid humans in vitro [57] . In vivo, there is no effect on placental perfusion. It can induce a transient tachycardia and decrease in PO2 and pH in the dam, but these effects have minimal repercussions on fetal heart rate and blood pressure. Because propofol is primarily metabolized by the liver, it should be used with caution in females with hepatic lipidosis. Maintenance of general anesthesia with isoflurane or sevoflurane are ideal, because these inhalation anesthetics are rapidly eliminated [56] . The combination propofol/isoflurane has been used successfully by our group in emergency cesarean section in camelids; a similar combination was also very good for cesarean section in the bitch [60, 61] .

Most of the postpartum hemorrhage cases diagnosed by our group consist of rupture or laceration of the vaginal uterine artery. This artery is easily recognized by palpation per vaginum during obstetrical manipulation and is peculiarly large in camelids. Excessive manipulation, and in particular fetotomy, may cause erosion of the mucosa and laceration of the artery. Unfortunately, many of these hemorrhages are missed, as no outward signs are apparent until it is too late. Typically, blood accumulates within the uterus for a few hours, followed by cardiovascular collapse. In one case, the female was found dead in her stall 2 h after delivery. Ruptured vaginal arteries may be sutured and blood transfusion should be considered in females with a PCV <10%. Packing of the vaginal with compresses, i.e. a device similar to the ''umbrella pack'' used in humans, may be helpful.",

Emergencies in the pregnant female present an additional challenge, in that the fetus has to be considered regarding response to treatment and viability. At times, it is important to make a decision as to which of the two (dam or fetus) has more economic or sentimental value, or chances to survive. One of the main challenges in emergency care in camelids is the lack of evidence-based scientific data on treatment and outcome assessment. Although extrapolation from other species has been possible, it is important to remember species peculiarities, especially with regard to fluid therapy. Handling of obstetrical situations is particularly important, as many female camelids loose their ability to reproduce due to iatrogenic vaginal adhesions and cervical trauma from prolonged manipulation.",
