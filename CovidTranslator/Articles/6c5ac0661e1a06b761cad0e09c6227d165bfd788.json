However, in spite of the billion dollars the United States Congress has proposed for the flu budget, only part of the solution is being addressed [1] . The threat of an H5N1 influenza virus (avian flu) pandemic is substantial, and an effective response is contingent upon effective coordination among state and local public health authorities and individual health care providers [2] . It is imperative that health care workers take an active role in the plans to meet demands that will be placed on the health care system. This is accomplished by developing an understanding of the etiology and manifestations of the virus, and becoming familiar with recent advances in research that address the demands of a pandemic. Equally important are the ethical considerations our state of preparedness will pose on the health care system, the community, and health care workers, both professionally and personally.",

With projections of the impact, it is important to consider what would happen if 25% to 30% of the nurses, physicians, and support staff were too sick to come to work [3, 4] . A study by the Congressional Budget Office estimates several consequences of a severe pandemic. The study indicates that 200 million people in the United States could be affected, with 90 million being critically ill and 2 million dying. It is estimated that a pandemic would decrease the gross national product by 5%, and the total approximate economic cost would be approximately 675 billion dollars [4] . As of August 23, 2006 , the World Health Organization has reported 241 human cases of avian flu across 10 countries, with 141 deaths. This constitutes a 58% mortality rate for identified cases [5] . The missing link to a logical pandemic spread is the lack of human-to-human transmission whereby analysis shows near all cases have resulted from direct contact with poultry, although this is not exclusive [6] . With the low probability of human-to-human contact, complacency about the potential for a pandemic is not an option. Additionally, even if H5N1 proves to have a negligible impact, planning will raise awareness and improve preparedness for a future pandemic influenza strain or another public health disaster such as smallpox, anthrax, or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [6] .",

Radiologic findings have included diffuse or multifocal infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. Diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, pleuritic pain, and bleeding from oral and nasal mucosa have been reported early in the course of symptoms for some patients [9] . Diarrhea is more watery than what is seen in persons affected by human viruses, and conjunctivitis with H5N1 avian influenza is rare (although it is sometimes seen in other forms of avian influenza). Sputum production is variable and sometimes bloody [9] .",

            "text": "Although there is currently no commercially available vaccine to protect humans against H5N1 virus that is being seen in Asia and Europe, there are studies underway. An experimental vaccine [20] studied an experimental vaccine in detail and conclude that it is possible to generate immunity with the ''use of a purified, subviron vaccine administered in two relatively high doses.'' The immunogenicity threshold for this study was set at an antibody titer of 1:40 or greater, which is typically thought of as seroprotective. Each of these two doses is six times the dose that is used in standard influenza immunizations. The experimental doses were found to induce immune responses in about half of the adults tested. The researchers suggest that there may be some dose-sparring approaches to enhance the efficacy of the vaccine. There have been several small studies that demonstrate the use of adjuvants such as aluminum [21] , or the intradermal administration of the vaccine [22, 23] , as opposed to the typical intramuscular injection of influenza vaccines. An adjuvant that has been also found effective in influenza vaccination is an oil-based compound called MF-59, a compound primarily composed of squalene [24] . Additionally, recent demonstration of an experimental vaccine shows a substantial increase in immune response when administered to subjects 16 months after the initial priming series [24] . Pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to enter or remain in the production of vaccines. Unpredictable consumer demands coupled with lack of financial incentives make the production of vaccines somewhat risky. Currently the worldwide manufacturing capacity for influenza vaccine is estimated at 900 million doses at the dose level of 15 mg. Clearly with the requirement of two doses at 90 mg per person, only 75 million personsd less than 1.5% of the world's populationdcould be fully immunized [4] . Based on the preliminary studies, only half of those would achieve seroprotection and it is not known whether this vaccine will offer cross-protection against other H5N1 strains of influenza. It is probable that more than one H5N1 vaccine will be needed.",

The need for pandemic influenza preparedness is extensive and expensive. Planning entails increased development of antivirals and vaccines, effective surveillance systems not only for people, but in agriculture, effective communication systems, plans to continue essential services, identification of health care priorities, and thorough guidelines for care. Critical care nurses, as well as all health care professionals, need to consider where their personal and professional obligations meet and end. There should already be discussions of contingency plan of the institution in which they are employed and the community in which they live. Additionally, a personal plan for their families with regard to economics, safety, and optimizing personal health outcomes during such a crisis should be considered. As many have said, ''It is not a matter of if, but rather of when.''
