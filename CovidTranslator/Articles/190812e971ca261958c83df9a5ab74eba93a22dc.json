Consider a CFR calculation for March 15. If an individual was symptomatic on March 1 and tested positive on March 10, they would not be included in the denominator, even though the patient probably contracted the disease before the 14-day lag time.",

A further consideration is the delay between testing and receipt of results. Consequently, individuals might not test positive until after the suggested 14-day incubation period. With disease spread, indications for COVID-19 testing will expand, thereby increasing the denominator size. These factors might act as time-varying confounding variables in the authors' calculation of CFR.",

This method assumes a normal distribution of time from illness to death.",

During a rapidly evolving pandemic, accurate measures of disease characterisation are important. Future estimates will probably involve patient-specific data for refined calculation. However, the provided CFR estimate of 15\u00b72% for countries outside China might be a premature statistic owing to the limitations of their methods.",
