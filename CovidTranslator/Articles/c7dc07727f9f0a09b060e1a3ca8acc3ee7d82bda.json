Throat swab samples would be collected and tested using the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. While waiting for the outcome of the RT-PCR test, patients would be quarantined in a dedicated area within the hospital compound to mitigate the risk of nosocomial spread. Contact, droplet and airborne precautions were undertaken for the suspect cases. In the event of a positive RT-PCR result or highly suspicious CT findings, patients would be transported to a designated infectious disease hospital for isolation, observation, and treatment. For patients with normal results, they will be admitted to the hospital for RT or receive RT as an outpatient.",

To date, more than 100,000 humans have been infected, and the numbers are likely to increase. Perhaps among the natural history of this virus infection, the predominant characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 is its remarkably high infectivity potential, where an infected individual can spread the virus to two to three other individuals when in close proximity. 8 While large-scale epidemiological studies from China have suggested that young and elderly individuals are equally susceptible to 9 it has also been shown that the latter subgroup, as well as patients with co-morbidities like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac conditions are more likely to succumb to severe illness. 10 Hence, there is a real concern about the impact of COVID-19 in patients with cancer. To date, two case series have identified that patients with cancer habour an approximately two-fold increased risk of COVID-19, and reasons underpinning these observations include older patients, immunosuppressive therapies, and recurrent hospital visitations. 5, 11 Robust infection control measures are therefore crucial to prevent cross-transmission between patients and between patient and healthcare workers within the compounds of a cancer centre.",

Amazingly, none of the patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia on follow-up, which again highlights the effectiveness of our infection control protocol. Unfortunately, due to the lock-down, only 18 of these patients were able to resume RT, as the remaining 52 patients were not allowed to return to the city. Some limitations of this study deserve mention. First, it is apparent that the number of patients decreased substantially following the lock-down (a 10-fold drop in case-load; Figure 3) . While it is unknown if such a meticulous protocol would be applicable in high-volume cancer centres from other parts of the world, reduction of case-load constitutes a key step of limiting human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and thus, patients' treatment ought to be prioritised accordingly. Finally, it is important to assess the impact on the long-term prognosis of these cancer patients, especially for those individuals who were unable to resume their treatment, which is the undesired consequence of a lock-down and robust infection control measures.",

As of Mar 12, 2020, a total of 80,981 confirmed cases and 3,173 death cases have been reported in China, of which an overwhelming majority was from Wuhan city and Hubei province. Due to the rapid human-to-human transmission and the potential severity of COVID-19, hospitals from the outbreak areas have been severly affected by the overload of infected patients, which has led to the suspension of several healthcare services. For cancer patients, a delay of diagnosis and treatment can be detrimental to survival. 3 However, cancer patients are also at risk of SAR-CoV-2 infection, as reported by two case series from China, which may be attributed to immunosuppressive treatments and recurrent visits to the hospital. 4,5 Thus, robust infection control measures are necessary to mitigate the risk of contracting COVID-19 in cancer patients. Radiotherapy (RT) constitutes a primary modality for the treatment of cancer, with approximately 50% of all cancer patients requiring RT during their cancer journey.",
