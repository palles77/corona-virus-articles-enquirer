Estimation of the incubation period of a novel pathogen can be vital for prevention and control, for example in order to determine appropriate duration of quarantine or observation of exposed persons. 1 In 2002-03, there was an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel coronavirus with more than 8,000 cases worldwide, mainly in Asia. The mean incubation period was rapidly estimated during the outbreak to be around 6.4 days, 2 and subsequent studies estimated a slightly shorter mean incubation period of around 4.0-5.3 days. 3 -6 Estimation of the incubation period of a pathogen such as the SARS coronavirus can be complicated because infection events cannot be directly observed and exposure data are consequently interval-censored. 7 The incubation period is thought to be a function of the initial infective dose, the speed of replication of the pathogen within the host, and within-host defense mechanisms. 1 Few previous studies have investigated the hypothesis that the incubation period might be correlated with the severity of disease, although some studies have examined the correlation between infecting dose and severity of disease. 8 , 9 Here, we analyze the association between the length of the incubation period and the severity of SARS using data from the 2003 outbreak in Hong Kong.",

First, we used a non-parametric estimator of the survival function that is a generalization of the Kaplan-Meier estimator for interval-censored data. 16 Second, we fitted a lognormal distribution 1 , 6 , 7 , 17 allowing for interval censoring, estimating the location and scale parameters (\u03bc and \u03c3) using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in a Bayesian framework.",

Ours is the first study that examines the association between the incubation period and the severity of SARS in the literature to date. It is unlikely that a shorter incubation period itself is the cause of greater severity, but our results indicate that it could be a marker of underlying biological processes that led to greater severity. A shorter incubation period could be indicative of a higher infective dose, leading to faster/greater pathogen replication, out-running adaptive immune responses or leading to a more aggressive and damaging inflammatory response, and thus leading to more severe disease.",

Another study on salmonella infection reported a correlation between infecting dose and severity of the infection. 9 In a previous study, we showed that healthcare workers, who could have received a higher infecting dose, had a significantly shorter incubation period compared with non-healthcare workers. 6 It may also be biologically plausible that a more rapid progression from infection to symptom onset is correlated with more rapid disease progression after onset.",
