Owing to the differences in its genotype, FCoV belongs to a separate clade along with other viruses, such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and canine coronavirus (CCoV), which can be isolated from cats. In this study, a PCR assay was developed to differentiate these coronaviruses concurrently. Multiplex differential RT-PCR was performed with primers based on the highly conserved coronavirus membrane protein. Three primer sets were designed: a primer pair (S1 and S2) that can bind to conserved sequences in all target coronaviruses, a CCoV-specific primer (S3), and a TGEV-specific primer (S4). Because of the high sequence homology among FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV, a nucleotide preceding the last pair of dissimilar nucleotides in S3 and S4 was substituted with an inosine to allow primer binding. This assay could detect and differentiate FCoV (n = 7), CCoV (n = 4), and TGEV (n = 8) precisely and did not show any crossreactivity with other pathogens. These results suggest that this molecular approach provides a rapid and reliable way to detect FCoV, especially in feline clinical specimens.",

In cats, the most common route of FCoV infection is oral transmission following contact with virus-containing feces . FCoV are of two subtypes-feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (Pedersen et al., 1981) . FECV is widespread and often causes asymptomatic or mild enteric infections, while FIPV causes feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is a fatal immune-mediated disease (Can-Sahna et al., 2007) . Since FIPV arises from mutations in FECV, several reports have suggested that mutation of the avirulent FECV genome alters the cell tropism of the virus, resulting in a virulent variant that induces FIP (Vennema et al., 1992 (Vennema et al., , 1995 Benetka et al., 2004) . Recently, it was reported that mutations in the furin cleavage site between the receptorbinding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains of the spike protein could result in altered cell tropism because of the modifications in the spike epitope structure (Licitra et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "Since FIP is widespread in cats, a rapid and reliable diagnosis is essential for prescribing a timely and appropriate treatment strategy. Non-specific clinical signs and lack of pathognomonic hematological and biochemical abnormalities hinder definitive diagnosis of FIP in veterinary practices. The tests for detecting the presence of coronavirus antibodies or viral genome, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can suggest a prior exposure to coronavirus or the presence of coronavirus genome (Addie et al., 2003; Hartmann, 2005; Brown et al., 2009) . However, CCoV also has a potential to induce enteritis or infectious peritonitis in cats (McArdle et al., 1992; Hartmann, 2005) , and TGEV can be carried by asymptomatic cats or cats with mild enteritis (Saif and Sestak, 2006) . Thus, a rapid and reliable method that can detect and differentiate FCoV simultaneously from CCoV and TGEV would be very useful for the identification of FCoV-infected cats (i.e., potential spreaders of FIPV) as well as for the isolation of FCoV-infected cats from unaffected cats in order to prevent the spread of the virus in a cattery. In this study, a simple and rapid nucleic acid-based test was developed for simultaneous detection and differentiation of FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV. To allow priming to the target sequence in the viral genome, a PCR-based method was developed with a deoxyinosinecontaining primer.",

In this study, the sequences of M gene targeted by CCoV-specific and TGEV-specific primers showed minimal consistent differences (three bases and one base, respectively). Thus, inosine was used to allow primer binding. Inosine is a synthetic universal base that can bind any of the four natural nucleotide bases in DNA (Hill et al., 1998) . The primers containing inosine thus compensate for the high rate of degeneracy of the target sequence and can substantially reduce the overall primer degeneracy and false priming by overcoming individual nucleotide mismatch (Knoth et al., 1988) .

The multiplex PCR includes more than one primer pair that increases the possibility of mis-pairing or dimer formation (i.e., hairpin, self, or cross-dimer), resulting in a decrease in the reaction efficiency. Considering these factors, the primer sequences were selected based on the lowest possibility of mis-paring or dimer formation, as estimated by the secondary structure or G value for the primer itself or among all primers. For the enzyme, an enzyme mixture with hot-start function was evaluated to confirm that the reaction efficiency between Fig. 4 . Multiple detection of a common sequence, a CCoV-specific sequence, and a TGEV-specific sequence. A recombinant plasmid vector containing the target sequence with a known quantity (i.e., copy number/L) was prepared and used. The Y-axis indicates the band intensities of PCR products using each dilution of the vector. Each regression line was constructed based on triplicate measurements. the enzyme mixtures was not different. Evaluation of the annealing temperature of the multiplex assay ranging from 46 \u2022 C to 60 \u2022 C also revealed that the highest reaction efficiency was obtained with 50 \u2022 C temperature, suggesting that the reaction condition of singleplex assay was suitable for multiplex assay. FECV replicates in enterocytes; therefore, infected cats are asymptomatic carriers or have mild diarrhea, whereas FIPV is distributed by macrophages throughout the body (Stoddart and Scott, 1989) . Phagocytosis by macrophages is a key event in the pathogenesis of FIP. However, FECV can also induce viremia without phagocytosis, suggesting that FECV and FIPV cannot be differentiated based on the evaluations of peripheral blood samples (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998) . In addition, mutations in the FECV genome can change the surface structures of the virus to enable phagocytosis by macrophages (Vennema et al., 1992 (Vennema et al., , 1995 Benetka et al., 2004) . As described above, CCoV and TGEV can also be isolated from cats (McArdle et al., 1992; Hartmann, 2005; Saif and Sestak, 2006) . Thus, the rapid detection and isolation of FCoV-infected cats is the only effective preventive strategy to avoid spread of coronaviruses. For this purpose, a PCR test was developed for detecting and differentiating FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV. It is expected that the proposed multiplex RT-PCR assay will enable detection and discrimination of FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV at a lower cost and in less time than individual tests and thus prevent unnecessary isolation or euthanasia of FCoV-uninfected cats due to misdiagnosis.",
