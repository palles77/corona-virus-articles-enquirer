Here, we present our cohort of Turkish LRBA-deficient patients from a single center, demonstrating a diversity of clinical manifestations. Method Seven affected individuals from five families were assessed retrospectively in this study. Results Of the seven patients with LRBA deficiency, four had homozygous, and two had compound heterozygous mutations. One patient remained disease free until the last follow-up (age 17 years). The most common clinical manifestations of the six symptomatic patients were organomegaly (6/6), autoimmunity (6/6), and chronic diarrhea (5/6). Recurrent infectious episodes were observed in three patients. None of the patients had hypogammaglobulinemia at presentation. B cell subpopulation analysis revealed low numbers of switched-memory B cell numbers in two of the four tested patients. During the disease course, three of the patients died, two of them underwent successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from matched sibling donors, and one is under abatacept therapy. Conclusion LRBA defects should always be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis for patients with autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs, chronic diarrhea, and organomegalies. In our experience, early HSCT is a lifesaving therapeutic strategy.",

Following the definition of agammaglobulinemia by Bruton in the 1950s as one of the first prototypic PIDs [1] , these diseases have been the subject of intense studies to elucidate etiology and develop effective treatments. Several new diseases and novel mutations have been identified during the last 20 years so that the number of genetically defined PIDs exceeds 300 [2] . Recently defined genetic defects and clinical presentations reveal that PIDs not only present with recurrent infections but also lymphoproliferation, autoimmunity, allergy, and malignancies [3] .",

When she was 6 years old, she developed immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) episodes, which were resistant to immunosuppressive therapies. During follow-up, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly developed. Her immune work-up revealed lymphopenia and elevated numbers of double negative T cells. She was diagnosed with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement therapy was initiated together with antibiotic prophylaxis. However, she died as a result of a severe pneumonia episode at the age of 14. In her family history, two deceased siblings had presented a similar clinical phenotype. A newborn brother (patient 3) presented to our clinic with neonatal diabetes. His immune work-up was normal apart from a slight reduction of immunoglobulin G levels. During toddler age, he had an uneventful follow-up apart from two episodes of viral pneumonia due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus. However, at the age of 3 years, he developed ITP which was resistant to steroids, IVIG, and plasma exchange therapies, followed by Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-induced lymphoproliferation and splenomegaly. Histopathological evaluation of lymph node biopsy showed reactive lymphocytosis. When he was 4 years old, non-infectious chronic secretory diarrhea started. Colonoscopic biopsies revealed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-like mucosal inflammation, which prompted the initiation of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). He had severe nephrotic range proteinuria, for which he underwent a renal biopsy. Lymphocytic infiltration of the renal cortex was observed. During the disease course, lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (ILD) developed. Genetic analysis revealed compound heterozygous mutations affecting LRBA (p.Asp1053fs, p.Ser2659*). Initiation of abatacept therapy (20 mg/kg every 2 weeks) alleviated the lymphoproliferation, but the diarrhea persisted and he died due to persistent thrombocytopenia and subsequent intracranial hemorrhage.",

Furthermore, immune cell subclass analysis including B cell subsets and lymphocyte activation responses were normal. Genetic investigations revealed a stopgain mutation (c.675G > A, p.Trp225*) in LRBA. HSCT was performed from a matched sibling donor, who was heterozygous for the mutation. Non-myeloablative conditioning with busulfan (7.5 mg/kg), fludarabine (180 mg/m 2 ), and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (40 mg/kg) was administered. A total of 7.16 \u00d7 10 6 /kg CD34+ stem cells were infused. Neutrophil and thrombocyte engraftment occurred on days 17 and 33, respectively. On day 90 posttransplantation, a CMV infection resulted in an episode of therapy-resistant ITP, which led to chronic hemorrhage due to a complication of catheter insertion. Weekly administration of romiplostim increased thrombocyte counts within 4 weeks. On posttransplant day 270, patient 5 had an episode of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which was resistant to IVIG replacement therapy. Methylprednisolone (8 mg/kg) was introduced, and sirolimus was initiated due to a second attack of autoimmunity. After hemolysis was under control, steroid doses were rapidly tapered down. He is currently under sirolimus therapy on posttransplant of 1 year, with mixed-donor chimerism. LRBA protein expression was tested 9 months after transplantation and found to be reduced if compared with a healthy control.

Serum immunoglobulins and peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were within normal ranges. Double-negative T cells were 7.5% of the total lymphocytes.

However, one of the patients, who is negative for LRBA protein expressions (Fig. 1b) and carries the same stop codon mutation as her diseased brother, is asymptomatic at the age of 17 years. Currently, her immune work-up is normal, apart from a slightly reduced number of switchedmemory B cells. She has no autoimmune diseases documented. Asymptomatic patients have been described previously [12, 13] . However, disease onset varies between patients. The latest age of onset so far is 17 years [13] .

Patient 7, for whom we applied abatacept in ILD, responded well after three doses. His lymphocytic infiltrates disappeared and respiratory functions improved. Patient 3 received abatacept to treat resistant thrombocytopenia, lymphoproliferation, and enteropathy. Although lymphoproliferation alleviated, diarrhea persisted and thrombocytopenia deteriorated which resulted in the death of the patient due to intracranial hemorrhage. There is increasing evidence that persistent abatacept infusions correct the autoimmune phenotype in LRBA patients; however, not all symptoms are responsive [4] . Until now, five patients have been reported to receive abatacept. In three of those cases, the major complaint was respiratory dysfunction resulting from lung infiltration, which responded completely to abatacept. According to our experience with patients, lymphoproliferative symptoms alleviate, whereas enteropathy and cytopenia persist following abatacept. To date, we cannot give clear advice whether or not to treat with abatacept as more data is needed for the precise therapeutic indications and the effectiveness of abatacept therapy.",
