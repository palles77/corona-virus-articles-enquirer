Vaccination remains the most effective measure to prevent influenza and its associated complications. The seasonal influenza vaccine uptake rates among RCHE staff were much lower than that among residents. In order to increase uptake of influenza vaccination among RCHE staff in Hong Kong, this study developed and evaluated a multimodal vaccine promotion program (VPP) based on identified factors affecting vaccination acceptance or refusal within the Hong Kong Chinese context. Vaccine acceptance was found to be significantly associated with belief in vaccine efficacy, duration of service, staff group and providing direct care to residents. The focus group study revealed that RCHE staff's belief in the efficacy and safety of the vaccine played a major role in vaccine acceptance. VPP effectiveness was evaluated with a cluster randomised controlled trial among RCHEs with staff vaccination rates below 50%. Compared with 2008/09, the 2009/10 mean staff vaccination rates increased significantly in both the intervention (39.4% to 59.6% (P < 0.001)) and control groups (36.3% to 47.6% (P = 0.008)). RCHE staff in the intervention group had a higher vaccination rate than in the control group (59.6% versus 47.6%, P = 0.072). This program reinforces the importance of a comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach to promote influenza vaccination for RCHE staff.",

With both winter (January-March) and Summer (July-August) influenza peaks, 2 influenza outbreaks in RCHEs can have significant consequences. 3 Healthcare workers (HCWs) are often exposed to influenza infection in both the general community (household contacts, public transport etc.) and the workplace, and therefore play an important role in healthcare-associated influenza outbreaks. 4 Efforts to reduce the impact of influenza include targeted vaccination of those at high risk of complications from influenza infection and their contacts. 5 Influenza vaccine is recommended to protect HCWs 2 from influenza (RR 0.20, 95% CI = 0.09-0.44) and influenzalike illness (RR 0.70, 95% CI = 0.59-0.83) 6, 7 and is also effective in protecting residents when they are also vaccinated (RR 0.14, 95% CI = 0.03-0.60). 8, 9 However, compared with the elderly, HCWs who work with them have lower rates of influenza vaccination. 10 Empirical research has identified a variety of reasons for the lower rates of vaccine acceptance among HCWs, including perceptions that neither they nor their patients are at risk, concerns over vaccine efficacy, and side effects resulting from vaccination. 4 Vaccination has been shown to result in reduced absenteeism among staff 6,7 as well as being cost-effective and probably cost-saving. 13 Although numerous international vaccination programs have encouraged HCWs to be vaccinated, there remains surprising resistance. 10 In order to increase uptake of influenza vaccination among RCHE staff in Hong Kong, this study developed and evaluated a multimodal vaccine promotion program (VPP) based on identified factors affecting vaccination acceptance or refusal within the Hong Kong Chinese context.",

Misconceptions about vaccine efficacy, on the other hand, were also found to be the common demotivator as indicated in studies in the West. 26 Aside from subjective perceptions, staff's years of service and job responsibilities (i.e. in charge, providing direct residents' care) were found to be associated significantly with vaccine acceptance. Those who had been serving between 1 and 10 years compared with new and those serving for more than a decade were more likely to hold positive attitudes towards vaccination. Staff who had been serving between 1 and 10 years accounted for more than half of the sample, which means that interventions should be focussed on newly hired and long-serving staff.",

The interactive talk on the intervention day should reinforce the critical messages contained in the video and educational/ promotional materials. The reminders (e.g. promotional gifts) distributed during the interactive talk should be able to extend the message of 'be aware of influenza and get vaccinated' beyond the workspace to other contexts (e.g. families). The telephone hotline and promotion visits should also be user-friendly and focussed on individualised concerns and needs, especially targeting staff with ambivalent attitudes toward seasonal influenza vaccine. Second, in order to enhance the unbiased assimilation of the message, the video and educational/promotional materials should integrate a known and trusted source for delivering accurate information about seasonal influenza vaccine.

With the World Health Organisation announcement of the H1N1 pandemic and the subsequent introduction of the H1N1vaccination, some members of the public may have been confused over seasonal influenza vaccine and the H1N1 vaccine. On the other hand, the emergence of the H1N1 pandemic may have influenced people's decisions regarding whether or not to receive the seasonal influenza vaccination. During the VPP, we spent considerable time explaining the difference between the two vaccines and ensured that participants understood that we were focussing on the seasonal influenza vaccine. An additional concern was that we focussed the VPP on RCHEs with vaccine uptake rates 50%. This limited the number of RCHEs we can approach for inclusion in this study. This resulted in our sample not having adequate power to detect the difference between RCHEs supported by government and those funded privately. An additional limitation was that since the questionnaire was anonymous, we were unable to conduct an analysis at the individual level. Therefore, we were unable to find the association between change in knowledge of and attitudes toward influenza vaccination and subsequent vaccine uptake. To study the sustainability of the VPP, we intend to monitor vaccine uptake during the upcoming influenza season.",
