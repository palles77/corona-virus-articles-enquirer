This rat colony was positive for complement fixing antibody against mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The agent, designated as rat eoronavirus (RCV), was shown to share common antigen(s) with MHV. By intranasM inoculation with I~CV, a fatal pneumonitis was produced in newborn rats. The growth of RCV has been reported on a primary rat kidney cell culture but not on any established cell lines. Because of the lack of the susceptible cell lines for IgCV, consistent work with I~CV still remain difficult. This brief communication recommends a rat cell line, LBC, providing propagation of RCV and useful tool for infectivity assay.",

Further dermis of this cell line are still under investigation. The LBC cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10 per cent fetal calf serum (FCS) and kanamyein (0.06 mg/ml). The FCS concentration was reduced to 5 per cent for maintaining the cells or harvesting the virus. Cells grown in 50 ml culture bottles were washed once with Dulbeceo's phosphate buffered saline pH 7.2 (PBS), and inoculated with 0.2 ml of virus material. After virus adsorption at 37 \u00b0 C for 90 minutes, the inoculated cultures were given maintenance medium and incubated at 37 \u00b0 C. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was first detected at 48 hours postinoculation (p. i.).
