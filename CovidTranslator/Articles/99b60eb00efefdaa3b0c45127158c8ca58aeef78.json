            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia may present with similar clinical symptoms, regardless of viral or bacterial cause. Diagnostic assays are needed to rapidly discriminate between causes, because this will guide decisions on appropriate treatment. Therefore, a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay with duplex reactions targeting eight bacteria and six viruses was developed. Technical performance was examined with linear plasmids. Upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were used to compare the qPCR assay with standard microbiological methods. The limit of detection was 5 to 20 DNA template copies with approximately 1000-fold differences in concentrations of the two competing templates. SDs for positive controls were <5%. The use of the qPCR assay resulted in 113 positive identifications in 94 respiratory specimens compared with 38 by using standard diagnostics. Diagnostic accuracy of the qPCR assay varied between 60% positive agreement with standard tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and 100% for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Negative percentage of agreement was >95% for M. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus; whereas it was only 56% for Haemophilus influenzae. Multiple microbial agents were identified in 19 of 44 sputum and 19 of 50 nasopharynx specimens. We conclude that in parallel qPCR detection of the targeted respiratory bacteria and viruses is feasible. The results indicate good technical performance of the assay in clinical specimens. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) represents a major challenge for institutions of rational medical treatment because of its diverse cause. Viruses and bacteria may present with similar symptoms, making them difficult to distinguish clinically. 1 When physicians lack information about the causative agent for their decision on appropriate treatment, it leads to increased use of ecologically unfavorable broad-spectrum antibiotics. 2 To provide appropriate and targeted treatment, physicians need diagnostic methods that are rapid, sensitive, and specific, the combination of which current standard diagnostic methods lack. Although present viral diagnostics mostly rely on nucleic acid detection, the properties of traditional cultivation techniques for bacteria limit the possibilities to develop a rapid method for detection of all tentative causes. Thus, a number of recent studies have aimed to develop molecular methods to detect bacterial and viral pathogens. To overcome the limitations of cultivation, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays were implemented because they allow rapid detection and are generally applicable. The method was implemented for common bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. 3e8 A vast number of studies have also explored diagnostic qPCR for viral causes of CAP, in particular influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza virus (PIV). 9e12 Nevertheless, few studies have aimed to develop combined molecular detection assays for viruses and bacteria with relevance to CAP. A recent evaluation of two available systems found that, although one clinically relevant pathogen could readily be detected, there were performance limitations when two pathogens were present in a specimen. 13 Because of the rapid turnaround time and a low limit of detection, implementing nucleic acid-based detection methods for CAP pathogens may shorten the time to diagnosis and increase sensitivity. Standard cultivation methods provide limited sensitivity for important causes, including H. influenzae, probably because of the fastidious nature of the bacterium, and even more so for S. pneumoniae. Because of autolytic behavior, the latter seems to survive poorly during both transport and after cultivation. 14 To fully take advantage of the molecular methods' sensitivity and specificity, target genes must be chosen with care. Capitalizing on previous work that validated suitable targets for several respiratory pathogens, we have developed a qPCR assay for causative diagnosis of CAP. 3,12,15e23 We have emphasized high technical performance, including the ability to detect co-infections when multiple pathogens are present at different concentrations. Here, we present a multiplex, qPCR method for simultaneous detection of eight bacterial and six viral pathogens with relevance for diagnosis of CAP.",

A new influenza A H3 strain with point mutations in the target sequence of primers and probes of the influenza A1 assay appeared during the course of our work, and our qPCR assay was therefore updated according to the recommendations of the Public Health Agency of Sweden (M. Brytting, unpublished data) to include an assay-denoted influenza A2. Primers and probes for H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were already established as uniplex qPCR assays for analysis of spinal fluid at our laboratory but not published before. Primers and probes for S. pyogenes were constructed with the Primer Express version 3.0 (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). All probes used the hydrolysis technology with black hole quenchers and fluorophores 6-carboxyfluorescein or VIC (Applied Biosystems). The TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix for DNA detection and the TaqMan Fast Virus 1-step Master Mix for RNA detection were used for bacteria and viruses, respectively (Applied Biosystems).

The ability of the duplex assay to simultaneously detect both agents targeted was tested by keeping one of the agents at high concentration (10 4 copies per reaction) while testing for the other agent. For PIV1 and PIV2 equal concentrations were used. The limit of detection was defined as the concentration at which all six replicates were detected, for theoretical reasons five copies per reactions was set as detection limit. An experiment was approved only if zero to one of the six replicates in the 0.1 dilution were positive. Efficiency was tested by dilution series of plasmid standards, ranging from approximately 1 to 10 5 copies per reaction, with equal concentrations of both targets of the duplex reaction. The analyses were performed in duplicates or triplicates, and detection of at least five dilution steps was required for an approved result. Standard curves were generated by plotting the quantification cycle (Cq) value against 10-logarithm of the concentration. Linearity (R 2 value) and slope of the standard curve was calculated with the data analysis program SDS version 2.3 (Applied Biosystems). Reproducibility of assays were assessed by comparing positive control results from 26 runs in two separate analysis batches performed >6 months apart by two persons with the use of separate plasmid preparations and dilution series. Relative SD of the Cq values was calculated as a measure of stability. In addition, reproducibility was assessed with clinical specimens spiked ",

Compared with the more traditional strategy of analyzing respiratory specimens for either bacterial or viral causes, the combined approach showed superior detection of agents that are regarded as clinically relevant. Thus, the added value was a combination of the high sensitivity of qPCR assays in general, and, in particular, the fact that infectious agents were detected which were not initially suspected. It was evident that bacteria were detected more often by the qPCR assay than by standard tests as exemplified by the detection of S. pneumoniae in 12 specimens by the former assay but only in five specimens by the standard culture method. The superior performance of the qPCR assay of detecting S. pneumoniae applied to both nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens, but especially so for sputum, and, notably, the Cq mean values of the latter were often low, indicating that several culture-negative specimens contained abundant S. pneumoniae-specific nucleic acids. These findings indicate that PCR-based methods may be preferable to culture-based methods for detection of S. pneumoniae in sputum, and this is noteworthy because it is the most important CAP pathogen. Likewise, the qPCR assay was superior for detection of RSV and M. pneumoniae, and in this case it was obvious that the change in the diagnostic approach provided the advantage. The additional detections of RSV and M. pneumoniae were in NpA and sputum specimens, respectively, and occurred at low Cq values, indicating abundant nucleic acids. These two agents were not targeted by the standard tests performed, although they, in retrospect, likely were clinically relevant.",
