            "text": "The objective of the experiment was to evaluate effects of increased milk replacer feeding on growth, intake, feed efficiency, and health parameters in stressed calves. Holstein bull calves (n = 120; approximately 3 to 8 d of age) were purchased from sale barns and dairy farms and housed in fiberglass hutches. In addition, wood shavings contaminated with coronavirus were mixed with clean shavings and added to each hutch before the start of the experiment. Calves were fed either a fixed amount (454 g/d) of a 20% crude protein (CP), 20% fat milk replacer to weaning at 28 d or a variable amount (454, 681, 908, and 454 g/d on d 0 to 7, 8 to 14, 15 to 31, and 32 to 41, respectively) of a milk replacer containing 28% CP and 17% fat without or with added dietary supplement containing bovine serum. Calves were also fed commercial calf starter and water ad libitum. Plasma IgG concentration in most calves on arrival at the facility was <10 g/L. Intake, change in body weight, feed efficiency, morbidity and mortality, and selected plasma metabolites were determined. Body weight at 28 d, 56 d, daily body weight gain, intake of milk replacer, fecal scores, days with diarrhea, and days treated with antibiotics were increased with feeding variable amount of milk replacer over the 56-d study. Starter intake from d 1 to 56 was reduced from 919 to 717 g/d in calves fed fixed and variable amounts of milk replacer, respectively. Morbidity, measured as the number of days that calves had diarrhea, was increased by 53% when a variable amount of milk replacer was fed. Calves fed variable milk replacer were treated with antibiotics for 3.1 d compared with 1.9 d for calves fed 454 g of milk replacer/ d. Concentrations of plasma glucose, urea N, and insulin-like growth factor-I were increased when calves 207 were fed variable amount of milk replacer. Dietary supplement containing bovine serum had no effect on any parameter measured. There was no effect of milk replacer feeding on concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids, total protein, or growth hormone concentrations. Plasma tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 was highest in calves with the highest plasma IgG concentrations on the day of arrival and might be related to the calf's ability to identify pathogens in the environment. Under conditions of this study, calves fed variable amount of milk replacer and exposed to immunological challenge before weaning had greater BW gain, but also increased incidence of diarrhea that required added veterinary treatments.",

Before weaning, intake of nutrients from liquid feeds is usually limited to stimulate early dry feed intake and allow development of ruminal function and early weaning (Bush and Nicholson, 1986) . Effects of feeding additional liquid milk or milk replacer to calves have been evaluated. Generally, increased intake of nutrients consumed in liquid causes less starter and forage intake (Jasper and Weary, 2002) , increased BW gain (Brown et al., 2005) , and greater deposition of fat and protein (Diaz et al., 2001) .",

There was no difference among treatments (P = 0.21) over the entire 56-d study (Table 3) ; however, preweaning mortality tended (P < 0.10) to be greater in calves fed additional CMR (VAR and GAM) compared with CON. Addition of the dietary supplement had no effect on preweaning or total mortality. Fourteen calves fed additional CMR died at an average of 12.6 d; and 3 calves on CON treatment died at an average of 14.0 d. Because calves were of varying ages and backgrounds prior to arrival at the research facility, it is possible that previous pathogenic exposure was responsible for observed mortality, particularly in the first week. Therefore, it is difficult to determine precisely the contribution to mortality from previous pathogen exposure and that caused by imposition of dietary treatments. We concluded that after 3 d of the study, it was likely that dietary treatments (particularly intake of energy and protein from CMR) would affect clinical outcome. Of calves fed additional CMR, 1, 10, and 2 calves died during wk 1, 2, and 4, respectively. Of calves fed CON, 2 and 1 calves died during wk 1 and 5, respectively. The second week of the study was the week of highest fecal scores and greatest number of veterinary treatments for both groups of calves. The increase in amount of CMR offered to calves fed additional CMR from 454 to 681 g/d on d 8 constituted a 50% increase in feeding rate at the time when calves were dealing with enteric challenges. It is possible that the abrupt change in feeding rate may have contributed to increased morbidity and mortality; however, further research is needed to confirm this observation.",

Fecal scores, days with scours, proportion of calves treated with antibiotics, and number of days calves were treated with antibiotics were greater when additional CMR was fed. Moreover, the number of days that calves were treated with electrolytes tended (P < 0.11) to be greater when calves were fed additional CMR. That antibiotic therapy was greater in calves fed additional CMR was of interest because therapy was initiated only when calves had a rectal temperature >39.4\u00b0C. Rectal temperatures were measured when calves had clinical signs of disease (anorexia, diarrhea, etc.). It is possible that calves on CON treatment also had elevated rectal temperatures but fewer clinical signs of disease (e.g., diarrhea) than calves fed additional CMR. However, there was no difference in the percentage of calves that exhibited one or more days with fever or number of days that calves had fever (Table 3) . Feeding additional CMR may increase fecal scores in preweaned calves, particularly within the first 2 wk (Diaz et al., 2001; Brown et al., 2005) , and increased days treated for illness (Ballard Journal (2002) reported no significant effect of CMR feeding method on fecal scores when whole milk was fed to calves.

However, those authors removed from their data set calves that died during the study (18 of 74 calves), which would skew the data upward, because calves that die are usually least efficient. Our data included calves that died except those that died within the first 3 d of the study. Further, calves in the study of Brown et al. (2005) were assigned to treatment only after a 7-d adaptation period, which is usually when calves are least efficient. In our study, calves lost approximately 300 g of BW/d in the first 7 d after arrival and therefore had negative gain to feed ratios.",

This is consistent with previous research (Kertz et al., 1984) that indicates a high correlation between water intake and CS intake. Daily water intake (Figure 4 ) was <2 L/d for all calves until d 28. When calves fed CON were weaned, intake of water immediately increased from <2 to approximately 4 L/d and then increased to the end of the study. The ratio of water intake to total DM was approximately 2 L/kg of DM before weaning and 4 L/kg of DM after weaning ( Figure 5 ). Ratio of water to DM intake increased dramatically in calves fed CON for the 4 d following weaning as intake of water increased faster than intake of CS. Intake of water in calves fed VAR and GAM began to increase when amount of CMR offered was reduced from 3.8 to 1.8 L/d. From d 28 to 31, mean daily low temperatures increased from approximately 10 to 20\u00b0C and remained at approximately 20\u00b0C to the end of the study. Mean daily high temperatures increased from approximately 25\u00b0C on d 28 to approximately 30\u00b0C on d 32; thereafter, daily high temperatures were approximately 30\u00b0C to the end of the study. Feed costs were calculated, assuming that CMR used in CON and VAR/GAM treatments cost $2.09 and $1.67/ kg, respectively, and CS cost $0.44/kg. Least squares mean costs of CMR consumed were $20.99 (SE = 2.36), $48.21 (SE = 2.16), and $53.42 (SE = 2.19) for calves fed CON, VAR, and GAM, respectively (P < 0.001). Costs of CS intake were $25.67 (SE = 1.75), $16.75 (SE = 1.60), and $17.85 (SE = 1.63), respectively, and were higher in calves fed additional CMR (P < 0.001). Least squares means of total cost, including feed, labor ($10/ hr), antibiotics ($1.56/dose), electrolytes ($0.90/dose), value of calf ($100/calf), and carcass disposal ($10/calf) were higher (P < 0.0001) for calves fed variable amount of CMR and were $83.23 (SE = 3.78), $128.63 (SE = 3.46), and $131.38 (SE = 3.51) for calves fed CON, VAR, and GAM, respectively. Additionally, feed cost per kilogram of BW gain was higher (P < 0.05) for calves fed additional CMR and were $1.77, $1.92, and $2.31 for calves fed CON, VAR, and GAM, respectively. These costs are lower than those reported by Brown et al. (2005) for calves during the first 8 wk of life due to lower cost assigned to CMR and greater BW gain in calves fed CON in this study.",

Concentrations of GH were higher early in the study when calves were exposed to greater enteric pathogens (contributing to diarrhea) and stress due to shipment (resulting in poor feed efficiency). Others (Hammon and Blum, 1997; Hammon et al., 2002) have reported changes in circulating GH concentrations with increasing age, but little effect of feeding rate on GH concentrations. Plasma glucose and urea N concentrations were higher in calves fed additional CMR (Table 4 ) and both metabolites were affected by a day \u00d7 treatment interaction. Weekly least squares means of urea N ( Figure 8 ) were higher in calves fed additional CMR on d 7, 14, and 28, when calves were still consuming CMR. Plasma urea N concentration in calves fed additional CMR on d 7 was 5.9 mmol/L, which suggests that a portion of the added CP in the CMR consumed by calves was used for energy with subsequent deamination and increased urea N concentration. Calves on all treatments also lost BW during the first 7 d of the study. Others (Smith et al., 2002; Blome et al., 2003) reported lower PUN concentrations in calves fed CMR containing 16 to 30% CP at 7 d after initiation of feeding. However, those data support the observed decline in PUN concentration with increasing age in our study. Increasing PUN concentrations after weaning in both groups was likely due to ruminal fermentation of dietary protein and absorption of ammonia from the rumen.",

Presumably, calves with least amounts of circulating IgG concentrations were least able to recognize pathogens and, therefore, mounted a weaker immune response (including production of TNF-\u03b1). Moreover, plasma IgG concentration measured in the first week of life is indicative of the degree of colostrum consumption; it is possible that some colostral component other than IgG could be responsible for observed differences in plasma TNF-\u03b1 concentrations. Elsasser et al. (1998) reported that plasma TNF-\u03b1 concentrations in Holstein calves increased during acute phase responses following oral challenge with Sarcocystis cruzi at 4 mo of age. However, other studies have shown variable relationships between pathogenic challenge and plasma TNF-\u03b1 concentration (Bieniek et al., 1998) . In the study of Elsasser et al. (1998) , mean plasma TNF-\u03b1 concentrations ranged from 72 to 109 pg/mL, which is somewhat lower than mean TNF-\u03b1 concentrations observed in calves in the present study.",

            "text": "Calves in our study were exposed to significant stress as evidenced by incidence of morbidity and mortality. Additionally, plasma TNF-\u03b1 concentrations in response to low-level endotoxin challenge may be affected by protein intake (Kahl et al., 1997) although no effects of milk replacer feeding were observed in this study. Johnson (1998) stated that decreased food intake in sick or immune-challenged animals is a response orchestrated by cytokines released by activated leukocytes. We hypothesized that neonatal calves exposed to shipping stress followed by exposure to environmental pathogens would be more susceptible to anorexia caused by increase production of cytokines. Although we recorded temporal changes in TNF-\u03b1 concentrations in blood, these changes were unrelated to dietary treatment. In addition, we estimated anorexia by determining the proportion of calves that refused any part of a CMR feeding and the number of CMR refusals, recognizing that the number of opportunities for calves to refuse CMR was greater in calves fed VAR and GAM, because they were weaned 14 d later than calves fed CON. There were no differences in proportion of calves refusing CMR or in the number of refusals recorded. Additionally, there were no effects of feeding regimen on concentrations of plasma TNF-\u03b1, suggesting that feeding method per se had no effect on anorexia or the calf's ability to use ingested nutrients. Increased growth rates were consistent with increased intake of nutrients. However, when conducted under the conditions of this study, feeding additional CMR increased incidence of disease and caused a trend for greater preweaning mortality in calves fed additional CMR. These data suggest that increasing CMR feeding should be done with caution in highly stressed calves.",

Preweaning mortality tended to be greater when calves were fed additional CMR compared with CON. Feed costs and cost per kilogram of BW gain were also greater. Profiles of plasma metabolites were generally consistent with source and intake of nutrients. Differences in plasma TNF-\u03b1 concentration associated with plasma IgG concentration suggest that calves with failure of passive transfer are less able to mount immune responses and, therefore, adaptive responses to inflammatory cytokine expression were less well developed. However, dietary treatment did not significantly affect plasma TNF-\u03b1 concentration. ",
