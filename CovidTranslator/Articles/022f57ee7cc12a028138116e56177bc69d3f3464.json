            "text": "Due to the recent outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Influenza and Ebola, isolation facilities have played an important role to prevent infectious diseases from spreading at initial stage. An isolation ward is a facility to isolate patients physically and to care them safely. One way to isolate a patient physically is to build a negative pressure isolation facility. However, unexpected failure or misuse of such facility makes it difficult to maintain negative pressure and eventually causes secondary infection, leaking the infectious pathogen to outside of the isolation ward. This study identifies the amount and velocity of leakage air from a patient ward by tracer gas experiment under abnormal operations of an isolation facility. In addition, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) allowed us to observe the outflow mechanism of pollutant. The results show that abnormal operations of a facility spreads pathogens to neighboring areas immediately and timely actions should be prepared against them.",

U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the air change rate of a negative pressure isolation ward to be over 6 air change per hour (ACH) and the pressure difference to be over 2.5 Pa. However, pathogens could spread out to other areas under the abnormal conditions such as malfunctions of facilities or door opening unexpectedly. When the pressure difference of an isolation ward is unstable under abnormal conditions, it is necessary that the amount of polluted air leakage from the isolation ward is measured and the countermeasures are prepared. In this study, the tracer gas experiments were performed to measure the air leakage under abnormal conditions. In addition, this study also conducted computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to measure the air leakage under the same conditions and to compare the results with those from tracer gas experiments.",

In Case 1 that doors were opened with fully functional the air supply and exhaust facilities, average concentration of the ward decreased by 40% in comparison to base concentration. After 10 minutes when doors opened with fully functional air supply and exhaust facilities, average concentration of the anteroom increased to that of the ward since pressure difference between the ward and anteroom was 0 Pa in Case 1. Average concentration of the hall increased by almost 25 times compared to the base concentration. Average concentration in the public area was lower than the detection limit. When the doors were closed under the abnormal condition in Case 1, it took about half an hour for SF6 concentration to be stabilized. According to the result, if doors are opened with facilities fully operational, it is possible to reduce air leakage and stabilize it very quickly. In Case 2 that the exhaust facilities were not operational with doors were closed, average concentration of the ward increased by 2 times compared to the base concentration. Since the pressure difference changed the positive, average concentration of the anteroom, hall and public area increased due to the diffusion of SF6. It took about 20 minutes for average concentration of the anteroom and hall to increase. It took about more than 20 minutes to increase average concentration of the public area. When the exhaust facilities were operational under the abnormal condition in Case 2, it took more than one hour for stabilized SF6 concentration to decrease. Therefore, if the exhaust facilities are not operational with doors closed, it is possible to reduce and stabilize the air leakage for a long time.",

In addition, even though the doors were closed, average concentration in the anteroom and hall increased. It took more than 20 minutes for average concentration of the anteroom and hall to increase. Average concentration of the public area was similar to the base concentration. When the air supply and exhaust facilities were operational under the abnormal condition in Case 3, it took about half an hour to reduce the SF6 concentration that was stabilized. In this result, if the air supply and exhaust facilities stopped with doors closed, it is possible to reduce the air leakage and stabilize it very quickly. Results of the tracer gas experiment indicate that the infectious pathogens can spread out to infect people in other areas under the abnormal condition. In Case 1, the pressure difference between the ward and anteroom or hall was 0 Pa, and the infectious pathogens in the ward leaked to the anteroom and hall. However, average SF6 concentration of the public area showed only slight increase compared to the base concentration, because the negative pressure difference between the public area and isolation ward increased. When doors are closed under the abnormal condition of Case 1, it takes about half an hour to reduce air leakage and stabilize it. When the air exhaust facilities did not operate with the doors closed (Case 2), average SF6 concentration of other areas except the ward showed highest result compared to other two cases. Therefore, with dysfunctional air exhaust facilities and wrong pressure level in a negative pressure isolation ward, the infectious pathogens leaks to the public area more easily. When the exhaust facilities are operational under the abnormal condition in Case 2, it takes more than one hour to reduce air leakage and stabilize it. In addition, when the air supply and exhaust facilities stopped under emergency with the door closed (Case 3), average concentration of the ward is the highest among three cases. When the air supply and exhaust facilities stopped under the abnormal condition in Case 3, it also takes about half an hour to reduce air leakage and stabilize it. Under abnormal situations as described above, relevant facilities of a negative pressure isolation ward should be under a regular and close inspection in order to protect medical staffs and other people from contagion.",

It indicates if the exhaust facilities stopped, polluted air leaks more critically than when the doors are opened or all air facilities stopped, because the pressure difference changes to positive between rooms. In Case 3 that the air supply and exhaust facilities stopped with doors closed, the concentration of polluted air in the ward is highest in all cases.
