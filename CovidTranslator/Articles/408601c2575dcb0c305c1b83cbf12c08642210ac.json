The filter cloth was prepared by depositing nanosize ceramic hydroxyapatite on a cotton fabric. The porous ceramic with pore size of several micrometers or less was fabricated by using water soluble starch as a pore former, and its permeability was controlled by adding insoluble starch. Bacterial filtration tests showed that the six-layer filter cloth can clear bacteria effectively, and the porous ceramic can remove 100% of the bacteria. Both the filter cloth and the porous ceramic can be used to clear or separate microbes. #",

Since the spread of these causative microorganisms is mainly via airborne particles (mainly dusts) and water [1] , it is of practical importance to develop filter materials for gaseous and aqueous treatment. The filtration materials are best to be nontoxic, especially for purification of domestically and medically used air or water. Moreover, in the sector of purification of microbe contaminated body fluids (blood, lymph, etc.), the optimal filtration materials should have enough biocompatibility with human cells as well. Hydroxyapatite (HA) is a very promising candidate because of its excellent biocompatibility and nontoxic hypostasis with organic tissues [2, 3] , and its adsorbability of bacteria and replication competent human virus [4, 5] .",

This result can be confirmed by SEM observation, as shown in Fig. 4b , which reveals that HA particles still fill up the voids between neighboring filaments firmly after the shaking test. Although the adhesion strength between the HA particles and cotton fabric was not quantitatively determined in the work, it is reasonable to assume that the strong interaction is due to a mechanical interlocking mechanism between the particles and the fabric.

The small pores always exist on grain boundaries and are surrounded by several grains nearby. These phenomena can be explained by the mechanism which has been discussed in our previous work [11] .

The ceramics produced by only WS generally have low permeability, while the ones produced by using IS have much higher permeability. For example, the sample W2 produced by using as much as 60 vol% WS only have a permeability of 0.11 \u00c2 10 \u00c012 m 2 , but the permeability of sample I produced by adding only 30 vol% IS reaches 0.38 \u00c2 10 \u00c012 m 2 . As the volume fraction of WS increases, the permeability of samples prepared by using also IS (M1-M3) increases much faster than that of the ones prepared by using only WS (W1-W3), and the same trend occurs to the open porosity of these two series of samples. These phenomena can be attributed to the channeling of the small isolated pores by the large pores that are produced by adding IS, as shown in Fig. 8b . According to Fig. 9 , using different ratio and amounts of WS and IS can produce porous ceramic of almost any permeability below 0.4 \u00c2 10 \u00c012 m 2 , and the proportion of large and small pores can also be controlled.",

Comparing to other samples, M4 has much more large and interconnected pores as well as the highest porosity and permeability, therefore it is reasonable to assume that other samples also have such good microbial filtration properties. Fig. 10 shows the cross sections of a sample before and after the microbial filtration test. We can see that many cells of E. coli, which are a bit larger than the true size of the E. coli because of the swelling in vacuum, are adsorbed on the porous ceramic during the filtration test. Fig. 10c shows the magnification of the central area in Fig. 10b , the obstruction of E. coli cells by the small pores can also be observed. It is clear that the filtering mechanisms of the porous ceramic include both the absorption of microbes on HA and the barrier effect of the small pores.",

Obviously, the volume fraction of IS has more influence on open porosity as it can form more large and interconnected pores.

With the increase of WS, to 80 vol%, for example, the number of small pores increases and those isolated pores are more likely to connect together, which results in the predominance of open porosity in total porosity.
