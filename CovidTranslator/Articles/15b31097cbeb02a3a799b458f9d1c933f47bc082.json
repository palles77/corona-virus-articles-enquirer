In this paper, we review the current status of the main technologies used to produce monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the B cells of antigen-sensitized animals. While companies are adopting advanced high-throughput methods, the major technologies used by veterinary and medical research laboratories are classical hybridoma fusion and recombinant library selection techniques. These methods have inherent advantages and limitations but have many common aspects when using immunized rodents. Laboratories with expertise in both methods of antibody development have a distinct advantage in their ability to advance mAb technology.",

The uniform characteristics of mAbs are critical for research and development work and this vastly improves the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic assays. Antibody reagents have provided the basis for a large number of highly specific and reproducible immuno-assays for the rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases (reviewed in Payne et al., 1988; Andreotti et al., 2003) . mAbs were expected early-on to replace other immunological assays based on older technologies such as complement fixation, or polyclonal serology. Similarly the high-specificity of mAbs produced in vitro make mAb cocktails the ideal, fully-defined-therapeutic antibody preparation. The characteristics of mAbs rapidly created an expanding role for these reagents in vaccine research and development, therapy, and clinical diagnosis. There are very clear reasons for why mAbs have not yet become the magic bullet they were first hoped to be, and recent advances such as transgenic mice, may help to realise these goals. Bio-terrorism, emerging infectious diseases, and the need to solve entire genomes full of proteins have guaranteed a future need for high-quality mAbs as we enter into the modern era of proteomics. Indeed, mAbs are viewed as a key reagent for solving the gap between genomics and proteomics that will require high-throughput adaptation of the techniques outlined in this review (Gavilondo and Larrick, 2000) .",

Few academic scientists produce mAbs using rigid quality assurance protocols. Development of mAbs is not trivial as there are many time consuming steps necessary to produce a quality antibody with the desired characteristics. Quite often mAb development is not given the required financial support. Many commercial companies develop mAbs as a service for a fee and in general these companies will return the first 8-10 binding clones to the client. The relatively low cost of using these services may be worthwhile for the simple production of mAbs to a purified recombinant protein. However when panels of mAbs are needed to recognise native epitopes on the surface of a pathogen, or when mAbs require biological functions, the first ten clones, especially if the immunogen was a peptide or a recombinant protein, are not likely to have the desired characteristics. Similarly, whole pathogen immunogen preparations are inherently contaminated with additional proteins from culture, unless they can be grown in pure form, and again require additional secondary screening. Furthermore, mAblaboratories with the additional ability to perform recombinant mAb cloning techniques have a greater capacity to characterise and develop useful reagents for diagnostic purposes, therapeutic leads, and scale up.",

To identify serological variants? For diagnostic work, mAb development is warranted for high risk pathogens as it will reduce the number and handling of animals, and will replace the in vivo requirement for preparing future lots of polyclonal antiserum from new groups of animals. In some assays mAbs are not as sensitive as polyclonal antibodies for they can be strain or subtype specific.

In an attempt to rapidly produce diagnostic antibody for use as controls in mAb development and diagnostic assays, we immunized mice with crude SARS-CoV infected Vero (green monkey kidney cell line) cell lysates in a rarely used approach known as the polyclonal ascites technique (PAS) (Lacy and Voss, 1986) . Polyclonal ascites has been used historically for the production of high-quality reagents to many veterinary agents such as FMD virus. While the PAS technique produced high-titre antibody to the SARS-CoV, the polyclonal antibody generated to the impure viral lysate gave an unacceptably high background in ELISA, immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of tissues. Clearly, this shows how the contaminating host cell proteins in the immunogen can elicit antibody that reacts directly with the same proteins if present in samples used in downstream applications. From this experience, we went on to develop mAbs and gave the remaining mice a final boost with purified SARS-CoV, performed fusions, and screened for binding using purified SARS-CoV particles . In contrast to the polyclonal sera the SARS mAbs we developed clearly show specificity for SARSinfected but not uninfected host Vero cells (Fig. 3) . Even with the use of purified virus for screening we were required to reduce the initial panel of 103 IgG positive clones down to 18 to negative screening for reactivity on the contaminating FBS antigens. Serum free growth of cells, once infected with virus, is one way to lessen the background effects of FBS. The monospecificity of mAbs is one advantage to producing a mAb rather than a polyclonal antibody. Monospecificity is inherent to mAbs whether derived from recombinant phage selection techniques or classical hybridoma fusion.",

This combines the ease and simplicity of hybridoma fusion with the ability to select fully human mAbs. Hybridomas derived from these mice are expected to meet the requirements of the pharmaceutical industry with new lead molecules for the treatment of infectious disease and chronic diseases such as cancer and may become the dominant mAb technology for this purpose. Providing these Xenomouse-produced-mAbs protect humans in vivo, the use of these mice should also bring the cost of production down so that fully defined mAb cocktails can begin to replace pooled human and equine polyclonal sources.

Most therapeutic mAbs in use today are either fully murine or humanized murine mAbs. The in vitro modifications required to humanise a recombinant non-human mAb, or to alter affinity, or modify specificity of selected non-immune mAbs are not trivial. The success of a humanisation strategy is empirical, and entirely protein dependent. The properties of the original parental mAb must be reproduced in the humanized recombinant version, and in some cases this may not be possible. These difficulties are shown by the fact that nearly each publication on humanized mAbs has had to customise the techniques of the humanisation selection strategy. Passive antibody therapy would be ideal for certain diseases such as FMD virus, where once protection was afforded, the serum titre would disappear and the animal would sero-revert to a negative status. Clearly, large-scale expression systems such as recombinant plants offer a possible means by which production costs could become feasible for this approach. Alternatively, animals can be made transiently resistant to certain infections by expressing protective antibody specificities in vivo on episomal transgenes. For example, Lorenzen et al. (2000) generated fish resistant to the fish-pathogenic rhabdovirus VHSV (viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus) by applying a gene construct encoding a neutralizing single-chain antibody. When administered to rainbow trout by intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA, recombinant single-chain antibodies were expressed as seen by the presence of circulating recombinant antibodies detected in the fish. Furthermore, protective immunity to the VHSV was established showing how mAbs can protect in a passive fashion through transgenes without altering the germline in a fish model of infection.",

However, in many cases the laboratory mouse is not the optimal animal model for a particular infectious disease. In this case, injection of a dead antigen may not provide the same antigenic stimulus as live replicating pathogens and another animal system may have to be used to develop mAbs. If the optimal model is a non-rodent species, we recommend the use of antibody libraries to produce mAbs from the B cells of the optimal host species (see below). For highly dangerous pathogenic microorganisms or zoonotic pathogens we recommend that safety be the highest consideration and that inactivated pathogens or recombinant proteins be used as the inoculating immunogen rather than live pathogen as hybridomas produced in containment must be grown and stored in containment. For new and emerging diseases, the most reliable starting point is to use hybridoma fusion in mice immunised with the best immunogen possible.",

Essentially this means there is but a single opportunity to screen a panel of hybridoma clones within a narrow window of time as the cultures continue to expand and become difficult to handle. However, for immune antibody libraries there is more time available to develop selection and screening assays once the IgV-genes are cloned into a library.

In previously immunized humans, about 1% of circulating memory B cells are antigen specific within 90 days of a booster immunisation (Nanan et al., 2002) . However, the blood is a very dilute source of B cells and only a limited number of activated B cells are present. Thus blood is not an optimum source of lymphocytes for the generation of recombinant antibody libraries nor for hybridomas (Yip et al., 1997) . Tissues rich in antigen specific plasmablasts such as bone marrow, draining lymph nodes and spleen are ideal for generating hybridomas and antibody libraries, providing there is adequate sampling of antigen-specific B cells. The lymph nodes of large animals and even the cervical lymphocytes collected from swabs of humans have served as successful B cell sources for immune antibody libraries (O\u00d5Brien et al., 1999; Berry et al., 2003a,b) . While detailed studies have not been completed, the plasmablast stage is thought to be the most useful for immune library generation as these cells contain about 150-300 times more specific Ig mRNA than a resting B cell (Yuan and Tucker, 1984; Lefkovits, 1995) . Fully differentiated, antigen activated plasmablast cells rapidly appear in pre-sensitized animals following a recall response indicated by elevated the specific IgG serum titre by day 7 (Fig. 2(a) ).",

Biases inherent to recombinant antibody libraries include: PCR amplification and cloning bias (amplification and restriction digestion), bacterial expression and folding/toxicity to the Escherichia coli host. Although historically a controversial issue, it is now clear that the identical monoclonal antibody can be isolated to the same antigen by using either hybridomas or antibody libraries. However, this may be a rare find and without exhaustive comparisons, molecular sequencing of immunoglobulin V-genes of antigen specific mAbs reveals that each system appears to capture a similar yet distinct representative cross-section of the B cell response (Ohlin and Borrebaeck, 1996; Caton and Koprowski, 1990; Duggan et al., 2001; Gherardi and Milstein, 1992; Kettleborough et al., 1994; Ames et al., 1995) . These studies are not comprehensive and the vastly different properties of immunogens used in these examples makes it difficult to directly compare the molecular genetics of the antibodies recovered (whole viruses versus highly conserved cytokine proteins). Thus mAb discovery methods have inherent biases that result in a unique cross sampling of the repertoire of mAbs that can be obtained from immune animals. Fig. 2(b) outlines the general flow of producing mAbs from immune libraries compared to hybridoma production followed by recombinant cloning. Both methods can be adapted to modern high-throughput methods at the clone picking and screening stages.",

These hybrid cell lines are made by fusing immortal myeloma cells (tumor cells) to the short-lived primary B cells of immunized rodents (the B cells) (Kohler and Milstein, 1975) . Drug selection, and screening of the supernatant produced from the hybrid cells (or ''hybrid-omas'') identifies antigen reactive cell lines which produce antibodies with desirable properties. Stable clones are expanded from these cells and can be scaled-up for antibody production. We recommend a modified direct fusion cloning method in semi-solid methyl cellulose-HAT containing media (Davis et al., 1982) with appropriate media supplements. For a modern description of the hybridoma fusion method the readers are directed to the following protocol Berry and Ranada (2003) . Single foci of cells grow out until they become visible to the eye and are transferred to 96 well plates for expansion and screening of the supern-atant. In many cases an ELISA based method is used to identify antigen specific clones. Alternatively, sub-cloning hybridomas from positive wells by limiting dilution is another means of obtaining clonal culture (Fazekas de St Groth and Scheidegger, 1980; Fazekas de St Groth, 1982; Spira et al., 1984) , although it is more laborious. By expanding antigen specific hybridoma cells in culture flasks from a single cell, it is possible to produce a ''clonal'' population of cells all producing a single specific antibody.",

More than ten thousand clones have been developed since 1975 (Michaud et al., 2003) with mono-specific reactivity to various antigens and are offered by many quality companies. Remarkably, there are many well known infectious agents for which mAb reagents do not yet exist and newly emerging infectious diseases require that mAb development capacity be maintained. However, despite recent advances in the establishment of new myeloma partners for various species (Groves and Morris, 2000) hybridomas are not as reliable for producing non-rodent mAbs. For non-rodent hybridoma fusions, murine myelomas are still used because of their robust growth and tumor-like properties that allow single cell cloning. Moreover these cells have the necessary cellular machinery for antibody production as they are B cell tumours. By matching the correct MHC-background the myelomas and resultant hybridomas are not seen by the host\u00d5s immune system as foreign cells, and are tolerated and therefore suitable for ascites production.",

It is not possible to stop and store primary B cells and revisit them in the future (without huge losses in viability) as can be done with libraries of recombinant antibodies which are stable for longer term once cloned into phagemids. Hybridoma fusion requires an intense period of laboratory activity, during the few weeks post fusion, when screening begins. In many cases a simple ELISA or dot-blot is set up as a primary screen. Clones positive in this round are ''moved-up'' to 24 well plates and then subjected to a second test. Negative screening may be required to remove clones that are reactive with contaminants. Testing usually become selectively more specific for utility in the intended downstream application to reduce panel numbers. For example a secondary screen may be on whole organism to verify reactivity. When developing mAbs to SARS-CoV an ELISA test was initially used as a screen, then IHC, followed by IFA, western immunoblot and finally to the virus neutralisation assay . Many of these common tertiary screens are also used for or similar to confirmatory diagnostic assays.",

For excellent recent papers published on the development of recombinant mAbs to potential agents of bioterrorism the readers are referred to Gao et al. (1999) and Hayhurst et al. (2003) .",

Alternative isotypes can either be selected from a library made with a non-IgG class specific back primer corresponding to that isotype, or a mAb can be re-constructed to be a particular class by cloning the appropriate constant domains (Wolbank et al., 2003) . Indeed, once a mAb is developed via either hybridoma or antibody libraries, recombinant antibody methods can be used to rapidly convert selected binding fragments to full length antibodies of any human or other animal\u00d5s isotype in vitro (Boel et al., 2000) . (2) Antibody libraries affinity-select the binding clones from a library and do not merely screen for binding activity. The selection process progressively enriches binding clones. (3) The ability to re-screen recombinant antibody libraries. It is possible to freeze down libraries as cDNA and screen these again in the future. (4) Antibody display libraries can be negatively subtracted against irrelevant non-target background proteins to help enrich for mAbs against receptor complexes. (5) Recombinant antibody libraries are well suited to many other downstream molecular approaches such as in vitro affinity improvements. (6) Recombinant antibody libraries allow mAb development from any species. (7) Recombinant systems are more amenable to develop faster and higher-through put screening of antibody libraries.",

The antigen scale cannot completely reflect the immunogenicity of a given immunogen as this is empirical and discovered only through testing. In addition, while it may be simple to develop monoclonal antibody against a particular immunogen, in many cases the antibodies may not have the desired binding characteristics or bioactivity. For example, it is simple to create antipeptide mAbs using peptide-carrier combinations. This situation could be classified as type A. However, if you use peptide-carrier immunogens to try to create mAbs which react with a recombinant protein, this would be shifted down to a ''type B'' mAb strategy as recombinant proteins do not always fold such that the epitope is accessible for binding (this would be discovered through inability of the mAbs to bind any form of the recombinant protein other than denatured protein). One step further, if you use peptide-carrier immunogens to try to develop mAbs which bind to a native protein on a virion, for example, this may be classed as ''type C'' mAb strategy on the antigen scale, as there is no assurance that the anti-peptide mAbs will recognise native protein containing the corresponding peptide epitope in the context of a whole organism. Moreover, there is no assurance of biological activity even if the antibody produced binds to the native organism (Trudel et al., 1991; Joyce et al., 2002) . For example, nonneutralizing human mAbs to the murine leukaemia virus bound to virions with affinities similar to neutralizing mAbs, which indicated that epitope exposure, while necessary, is not sufficient in some cases for viral neutralisation in vitro (Burkhart et al., 2003) . Thus, it is very easy to underestimate the difficulty associated with the production of high-quality mAbs. To date no method has linked the ability to select binding clones to a bio-assay involving a pathogen; panels of mAbs must still first be identified through binding properties, and then these molecules must be tested for biological activity in independent assays.",

While the use of immuno-stimulants or adjuvants can improve the inflammation at the injection site and the use of these agents is recommended to improve the B cell response to weak immunogens, adjuvants will also improve the response to any passenger contaminants and thus purity again is paramount. While many rapid immunisation methods have been developed (Berry et al., 2003a) , herein we provide a basic immunisation strategy for hybridoma fusion in mice. In total, for a recombinant protein under typical conditions, about 2 mg of purified protein is optimal; 1 mg of protein for immunisations and 1 mg for screening. This can be administered in four-to five injections of 10-50 lg of purified or total protein per mouse, per dose. Another method to measure the dose is based upon the infectious load prior to pathogen inactivation. For example, loads of 10 7 -10 9 infectious units (or plaque forming units) in the live material prior to inactivation, is a sufficient dose per injection provided the material is relatively pure. Still another measure is viral-particle counting using electron microscopy. In this case 10 9 -10 11 particles per injection is an approximately equivalent dose. These values are general guidelines and have worked well in our hands. Other examples of factors that provide a positive effect on success include: (1) good technique and quality control; (2) highly trained technical staff; (3) purified immunogens for injections and antigen for screening. Negative influences include: (1) poor technique or inexperience; (2) impurities in the immunogen and/or antigen (FBS or cell debris); (3) the use of a different immunogen for the immunisation and the screening steps (e.g., immunize with synthetic or recombinant immunogen, and screen on whole virus as antigen).",

The native organism is not always ideal as an immunogen if it cannot be adequately purified. Panels of mAbs against complex antigenic mixtures, such as a whole bacterium, require more downstream work (secondary screenings) in order to determine which molecule is targeted (Western immunoblots, immunoprecipitation, etc.). This can be further complicated when dealing with a biocontainment level 3 or 4 organism which must first be inactivated and then brought out of containment to level 2 for mAb production. There is less value in hybridomas developed within level 3 or 4 containment space, as the hybridomas can never be removed. While the live cell line cannot be removed from containment the hybri-doma RNA, encoding the specificity of the mAb, can be safely removed once the proteins are denatured in strong chemicals such as guanidium isothiocyanate, commonly used to harvest RNA for recombinant mAb production.",

Alternatively, there are examples in both hybridoma fusion and antibody libraries that have utilised antibody to mask a dominant epitope in order to develop mAbs to other recessive targets (Gani et al., 1987; Ditzel et al., 1995; respectively) .",

Common applications include: Research tools for cell, antigen, or pathogen identification; pathogenesis studies; ligands for column chromatography and molecule purification; diagnostic reagents ; therapeutic antibody preparations and the identification of protective antigens/epitopes in vaccine development. These are in addition to the many procedures in which mAbs are used in the basic science laboratory. We have included several examples to illustrate the utility of mAbs in diagnostic and research and development. For example, to identify the SARS-CoV in infected Vero cells in immunohistochemical staining, Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies mycoides in thin section immuno-EM, intracellular infection of human HeLa cells by Chlamydia (3) Confocal images of mAb EV1H1 binding to the obligate intracellular eubacterial pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis, mouse pneumonitis in infected HeLa cell monolayers. In this case, mAb EV1H1 was directly conjugated to FITC and used to stain methanol fixed monolayers. The bright field is shown for comparison; I, intracellular inclusion.

(5) Flow cytometry depicting binding of a recombinant human IgG1 mAb to the gp120 of HIV-1. This mAb stains HeLa cells which express gp120 (blue fill) but not to normal HeLa cells (red line). trachomatis using IFA, western immunoblot of the PA toxin of Bacillus anthracis, and recombinant human mAb recognition of cells expressing the gp120 of HIV-1 (Fig. 3) . Immuno-electron microscopy (IEM) is a particularly valuable technique for pathogen identification. We direct the readers to an excellent review on the application of IEM to emerging and bioterrorism agents used to rapidly identify pathogens (Hazelton and Gelderblom, 2003) . The morphology or virions, spores and bacterium are easily resolved using electron microscopy and in combination with quality mAb reagents they generate a powerful tool for confirmatory diagnostic procedure (Fig. 3) . IEM can be used to identify ultrastructural binding in thin section, or more rapid protocols for demonstration of surface immunostaining.",

In general IgG class of mAbs is desired due to the high specificity and low cross-reactivity in this, usually affinity matured, class of antibody. Similarly, if the C-region is inappropriate, then the mAb is less likely to be functional in vivo and of limited or no therapeutic value. Monoclonal antibodies of the desired constant region isotype are obtained by using class-specific secondary reagents that recognise specific constant domains (e.g., Fcc) and by using primers which amplify the desired isotype (Moreno de Alboran et al., 1995; Steinberger et al., 1996; Berry et al., 2003b) , for hybridoma and immune libraries respectively.",

The use of large scale expression systems, trans-species Ig transgenic animals and high-throughput systems will increase greatly over the next decade. It is crucial that government and academic training institutions develop and sustain suitable strategies to ensure adequate availability of trained staff with skill in both tissue culture and recombinant mAb development techniques. We anticipate that phage library strategies using murine V-genes from hybridomas in combination with immune repertoires from Xenomice will be an easy way to swap antigen specific human immunoglobulin chains for a given specificity. In addition to the explosive growth predicted for non-rodent mAb development, it is conceivable that genetically engineered mice encoding V-genes from other large animal species will be developed in the future for veterinary use. Strategies for a rational approach to reagent and immuno-assay development are needed to help ensure protection of livestock and public health, and for protection of front line responders and the war fighter.",
