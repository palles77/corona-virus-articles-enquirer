In an effort to determine which viral proteins might be determinants of enterotropism, immunoblots of MHV-Y and MHV-RI virions using anti-S, -N and -M protein-specific antisera were performed. The uncleaved MHV-Y and MHV-RI S proteins migrated slightly faster than the MHV-A59 S protein. The MHV-Y S protein was inefficiently cleaved. The MHV-Y, MHV-RI and MHV-A59 N and M proteins showed only minor differences in their migration. The S genes of MHV-Y and MHV-RI were cloned, sequenced and found to encode 1361 and 1376 amino acid long proteins, respectively. The presence of several amino acids changes upstream from the predicted cleavage site of the MHV-Y S protein may contribute its inefficient cleavage. A high degree of homology was found between the MHV-RI and MHV-4 S proteins, whereas the homology between the MHV-Y S protein and the S proteins of other MHV strains was much lower. These results indicate that the enterotropism of MHV-RI and MHV-Y may be determined by different amino acid changes in the S protein and/or by changes in other viral proteins.",

            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a singular name for several murine coronaviruses, causes a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from mild enteritis or rhinitis to fatal hepatitis or encephalitis. MHV strains can be divided into two biotypes, respiratory and enterotropic, on the basis of their initial site of replication. Following oronasal inoculation, respiratory MHV strains initiate replication in the upper respiratory tract and then disseminate to multiple organs if the mouse is sufficiently susceptible due to age, genotype or immune status (Barthold, 1986; Compton et al., 1993) . On the other hand, replication of enterotropic MHV strains, such as MHV-RI and MHV-Y, is largely restricted to the intestinal mucosa, with minimal or no dissemination to other organs (Barthold, 1987; Barthold et al., 1993) . All ages and genotypes of mice are susceptible to infection with enterotropic MHV-Y but only young mice develop disease in the form of enteritis. Disease is restricted to the intestinal tract regardless of route of inoculation or immune status of the mouse (Barthold, 1987; Barthold et al., 1993) . Unlike respiratory MHV strains in which viral titers mirror the severity of lesions, the titers of enterotropic MHV produced do not reflect the level of lesion formation, in that high viral titers are produced in the intestines of MHV-Y-infected adult mice in the absence of lesions (Barthold and Smith 1987; Barthold et al., 1993) .",

            "text": "MHV virions contain two envelope glycoproteins (S and M) and an internal nucleocapsid protein (N) (Spaan et al., 1988) . The S glycoprotein forms the characteristic peplomers on the virion surface. It is synthesized as a 170-200 kDa protein which is co-translationally glycosylated, oligomerized and post-translationally cleaved by trypsin-like host proteases into two subunits: the N-terminal $1 and C-terminal $2 subunits . Cleavage is dependent on the virus strain and host cell type in which virus was grown (Frana et al., 1985) . The S protein is believed to be responsible for the initiation and spread of infection, by mediating the attachment of the virus to cell surface receptors and by cell to cell fusion (Collins et al., 1982; Dveksler et al., 1991; Williams et al., 1991) . The S protein also elicits neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses (Collins et al., 1982; Wege and Dorries, 1984; Korner et al., 1991; Mobley et al., 1992) . The M protein is a 20-30 kDa integral membrane glycoprotein. It accumulates in the membranes of the Golgi apparatus where it interacts with viral nucleocapsids and determines the site of virus budding (Armstrong et al., 1984; Tooze et al., 1984) . The N protein is a 43-60 kDa phosphoprotein which binds to viral genomes to form helical nucleocapsids (Stohlman and Lai, 1979) .",

Although the molecular mechanisms of MHV tissue tropism are still not clear, several studies have shown an important role for the S protein in determining viral virulence and pathogenesis. Variant viruses which possess point mutations or deletions in the S1 subunit or point mutations in the $2 subunit have altered target cell specificity, rates of spread or virulence (Dalziel et al., 1986; Fleming et al., 1986; Wege et al., 1988; Fazakerley et al., 1992; Hingley et al., 1994) . In contrast to respiratory MHV strains, the viral factors which contribute to the tropism and pathogenesis of enterotropic MHV strains have not been determined. In an attempt to understand the virus strain-specific mechanisms of enterotropism, we characterized the virion proteins of two enterotropic MHV strains, MHV-Y and MHV-KI. In this paper we report immunoblot profiles of the structural proteins S, M and N and the predicted amino acid sequences of the S proteins of MHV-Y and MHV-RI.",

Immunoblotting was performed because of its high degree of sensitivity and because it allowed for the identification of multiple forms of each of the virion proteins. An immunoblot of virion proteins probed with anti-S antiserum (Fig. 1A) showed that the uncleaved S proteins of MHV-RI and MHV-Y migrated as broad bands (ranging from 150 to 250 kDa) whereas MHV-A59 S protein migrated as a 180 kDa protein. The high variability in the size of these proteins is probably due to the varying levels of glycosylation of the S protein cores. Interestingly, although the cleaved form of the S protein was clearly found in MHV-RI and MHV-A59 virions, very little or no cleaved products were detected in MHV-Y virions. A low to undetectable level of cleavage of the MHV-Y S protein was also seen in purified MHV-Y virions treated with trypsin, cell lysates from MHV-Y infected J774A.1 ceils and homogenates of MHV-Y infected infant mouse intestines (data not shown). Only minor differences were identified among the N proteins of MHV-A59, MHV-RI and MHV-Y in immunoblots using anti-N antiserum (Fig. IB) . The major form of the N protein found in MHV-A59, MHV-RI and MHV-Y virions migrated at 51-54 kDa, other forms migrated at approximately 45, 47 and 80 kDa. Several forms of the N protein have been reported by other investigators and may be cleavage/degradation products or dimers of the N protein (Robbins et al., 1986) .",

The hydrophobic membrane anchor sequence located at amino acids 1323-1339 of the MHV-RI S protein and amino acids 1307-1322 of the MHV-Y S protein was also conserved. The KWPWYVWL motif found in all coronavirus S proteins is present in the MHV-RI S protein between amino acids 1315 and 1322 and in the MHV-Y S protein between amino acids 1299 and 1306 (Boireau et al., 1990) . The MHV-RI and MHV-Y S proteins have 22 predicted glycosylation sites, the same number predicted for the MHV-4 S protein (Schmidt et al., 1987; Parker et al., 1989) . The predicted glycosylation sites for the MHV-RI S protein are located in the same positions as those predicted for MHV-4, but the positions of only 20 predicted glycosylation sites for the MHV-Y S protein are conserved. The predicted glycosylation sites at amino acids 582 and 709 of MHV-4 were absent from the MHV-Y S protein and were replaced by predicted glycosylation sites at amino acids 575 and 756 of the MHV-Y S protein. Even though the predicted amino acid sequence of the MHV-Y and MHV-RI S proteins indicated that the protein cores are larger and that they have one more predicted glycosylation site than the MHV-A59 S protein, the MHV-RI and MHV-Y S proteins migrated faster on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel than the MHV-A59 S protein (Fig. 1) . One reason for the faster migration of the MHV-RI and MHV-Y S proteins may be that fewer of the predicted glycosylation sites on these protein are glycosylated.",

First, the MHV-Y S protein cleavage signal sequence differs from the consensus cleavage signal by the replacement of an arginine with a histidine (HRARR instead of RRARR). The presence of the histidine in this particular position within the cleavage signal sequence may alter interactions between the MHV-Y S protein and the active site of cellular proteases resulting in the low to undetectable levels of MHV-Y S protein cleavage seen in immunoblots. Alternatively, the MHV-Y S protein cleavage signal may be functional but because of other changes in the region, this site is not accessible to proteases. The KS to TT change at positions -6 and -7 relative to the cleavage site and/or the addition of a potential glycosylation site (NYS) at position -10 relative to the cleavage site may cause conformational changes within the protein resulting in the inaccessibility of the cleavage signal sequence to the trypsin-like proteases which cleave most MHV S proteins. It is interesting to note that even though the MHV-Y S protein is inefficiently cleaved, it still induces cell-cell fusion in many types of cells in culture and in the intestinal mucosa (Compton, unpublished data) . This observation agrees with recent results indicating that cleavage of MHV S proteins may increase the efficiency of fusion but is not essential for fusion induction (Gombold et al., 1993; Stauber et al., 1993; Taguchi, 1993) .",

Small numbers of changes in the S protein of variants of MHV-4 and MHV-A59 have been linked to differences in the virulence and tropism of these variant viruses. Also, comparison of the S protein sequences of respiratory and enteric strains of BCV indicate that the differences in tropism between BCV strains may be determined by as few as 25 amino acid changes in the S proteins (Gallagher et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1992; Hingley et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 1994) . It is interesting to speculate that one or more of the 58 amino acid differences found between the MHV-4 and MHV-RI S proteins is sufficient to produce the differing tropisms of these strains. One or more of the 58 amino acid difference changes in the MHV-RI S protein is sufficient to alter the receptor specificity of this virus. MHV-RI infects cells expressing the MHVR isoform of the MHV receptor but not cells expressing the mmCGM2 isoform of the MHV receptor, whereas MHV-4, MHV-Y and MHV-A59 bind to and infect both types of cells (Compton, 1994) . But of the 58 amino acids which differ between the MHV-RI and MHV-4 S proteins only three of the MHV-RI-specific changes (at amino acids 539, 586 and 1285) were also present in the MHV-Y S protein. These results indicate that if the enterotropism of these two strains is determined solely by the S protein, the determinants of enterotropism may be structural, resulting from different combinations of amino acid changes in the MHV-RI and MHV-Y S proteins. Alternatively, the determinants of tissue tropisms may not be limited to a single viral protein. Given the high mutation and recombination rates of coronaviruses (Lai, 1992) , studies using recombinant viruses engineered to possess defined mutations in the S or other viral genes will be necessary to elucidate the importance of specific amino acids in determining the tropism of MHV strains.",
