Recall that DO 2 is a function of cardiac output (CO) and the arterial oxygen content (CaO 2 ). Arterial oxygen content is a function of arterial oxygen saturation, the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin, the hemoglobin concentration, and, for the amount of oxygen dissolved in blood (unbound to hemoglobin), the partial pressure of oxygen. Ordinarily DO 2 exceeds VO 2 by a factor of four (800 to 1200 ml/min vs. 200 to 300 ml/min). Thus the extraction ratio (O 2 ER \u00bc VO 2 /DO 2 ) is 20% to 30%. As long as DO 2 exceeds VO 2 , VO 2 is \"supply independent.\" However, below DO 2crit VO 2 becomes \"supply dependent,\" and VO 2 decreases as DO 2 decreases, creating a situation in which end-organs are at risk for ischemia. It is at this point that a transfusion is clearly indicated.",

This also requires that pulmonary function is intact since it requires full hemoglobin oxygen saturation and oxygen dissolved in blood (not bound to hemoglobin). It should be noted that at this hemoglobin level the oxygen dissolved in blood becomes a major contributor (almost 75%) to the oxygen delivered. It should also be mentioned that the DO 2crit is modified by the patient's oxygen requirements above baseline (e.g., catabolic states such as sepsis, burns) and the presence of end-organ disease such as coronary artery disease.",

            "text": "During surgery acute blood loss is usually replaced with crystalloid solutions and, if in sufficient volume, results in acute normovolemic hemodilution. Compensatory changes include sympathetic stimulation, resulting in tachycardia and increased cardiac output. Decreased viscosity reduces afterload, increases preload, and improves flow at the capillary level. Since capillary flow is not maximal under resting conditions, capillary recruitment is an adaptive mechanism as well. In addition, there is redistribution of blood to the tissues that are oxygen supply dependent (e.g., heart and brain) and oxygen extraction is increased. It is important to note that myocardial oxygen extraction is high under normal circumstances; thus the reserve is less. The brain has greater extraction reserve than the heart. Thus the heart is more dependent on increasing blood flow to increase oxygen delivery; the significance of this becomes clear in coronary artery disease. A failure for acute normovolemic anemia to deliver oxygen in excess of consumption is another argument in favor of blood transfusion.",

Otherwise it has come to be viewed as a liberal transfusion trigger. Recall that in an otherwise normal situation, DO 2crit has not been reached until hemoglobin decreases to 3.5 g/dl. Although no clinician probably pushes a patient to this extreme (unless the patient requests no transfusion based on religious reasons and the like), the less likely a transfusion is really indicated, the more the risks of transfusion negatively impact the risk/benefit ratio. It is also interesting to note that men and women tend to be treated equally when the decision to transfuse is made, despite the fact that normal women are anemic relative to men. Using the same transfusion triggers hardly seems rational. Finally there is a concern that a transfusion might not substantially increase oxygen delivery (see discussion of blood storage lesions in question 8). These are strong arguments for closely scrutinizing the consideration to transfuse.",

At this point in time, the blood supply is as safe as it as ever been, with risks of contracting hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a developed nation estimated at 1 in 2.4 million units transfused. Donated blood is tested for hepatitis B (hepatitis B core antigen), hepatitis C (hepatitis C antibody), syphilis, HIV, human T cell lymphotropic virus, West Nile virus, and cytomegalovirus. Because of improvments in testing, the window between donation and seroconversion is becoming increasingly narrow. However, there are new infectious risks, including contracting prion-mediated diseases (variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), parasitic disease (Chagas disease, malaria), and avian flu. There are concerns that severe acute respiratory syndrome will eventually be spread through the blood supply. The risks of these diseases vary with the geographic locality.

Mistransfusion is thought to occur with a frequency between 1:14,000 and 1:18,000. Most reactions occur during or shortly after a transfusion. Clinical manifestations include fever; chills; chest, flank, and back pain; hypotension; nausea; flushing; diffuse bleeding; oliguria or anuria; and hemoglobinuria. General anesthesia may mask some of the clinical manifestations, and hypotension, hemoglobinuria, and diffuse bleeding may be the only signs. It should be noted that the signs of a severe hemolytic reaction might be missed while the patient is under general anesthesia or attributed to another cause. n Anaphylactic reactions are caused by binding of IgE; present with bronchospasm, edema, redness, and hypotension; and require urgent treatment with epinephrine, fluid infusions, corticosteroids and antihistamines, and other therapies as indicated by severity and progression of symptoms.",

Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions usually occur in patients who have had prior transfusions; headache, nausea, and malaise are associated symptoms. The reaction is caused by leukocyte antibodies, and leukocyte-depleted red blood cells may be indicated for these patients. Antipyretics may decrease the symptoms if given before the transfusion; meperidine may decrease the severity of chills. n Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is in the top three of transfusion-related deaths, having a mortality of 50%. A form of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, TRALI is also immune related and is usually noted within 6 to 12 hours after transfusion. Symptoms include hypoxia, dyspnea, fever, and pulmonary edema; treatment is supportive. n Urticarial reactions secondary to mast cell degranulation do not require that the transfusion be stopped; antihistamines may be given. n These transfusion reactions are compared in Table 6 -1. 8. What are the current standards for the length of storage of blood? What is a blood storage lesion? Federal regulation requires that at least 70% of transfused red blood cells survive 24 hours after CPDA-1 and for 42 days when AS-1 (Adsol) or AS-3 (Nutrice) is added. Changes in stored blood that reduce post-transfusion viability are known as storage lesions. They include reduction in red cell deformability; altered red cell adhesiveness; depletion of adenosine triphosphate stores; and reduction in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) which decreases the ability of the hemoglobin dissociation curve to shift to the right, which enhances peripheral oxygen release. Proinflammatory cytokines accumulate and, even after 2 weeks, are capable of significantly priming neutrophils for an exacerbated inflammatory response.",

All blood components have resulted in TRALI, including packed erythrocytes, random donor platelets, single donor (apheresis) platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate. However, the cellular components have a greater association with TRALI. Even autologous blood has resulted in TRALI, suggesting that there may be some storage lesion contributing to its etiology. Although donor antibodies have been shown to be present in many TRALI series, their presence is neither necessary nor sufficient to result in TRALI. It is now believed that TRALI is multifactorial and a two-event subtype of acute lung injury. Because of some associated conditions, the recipient has a high level of inflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines), primed white blood cells, and pulmonary endothelium. The administered blood product provides the second event, through classic antibody-antigen coupling or the lipid products or other cytokines generated during storage of the blood products.

Two types of oxygen-carrying solutions have been developed: n Perfluorocarbon emulsions that have a high gas-dissolving capacity for oxygen n Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers. This discussion focuses on the latter. Such compounds are manufactured from human recombinant hemoglobin, outdated human blood, or bovine blood. The stromal components of erythrocytes are removed, and the hemoglobin molecule polymerized or liposome encapsulated to prevent rapid renal excretion and nephrotoxicity. Cell-free hemoglobin solutions have two major problems. First, they have low concentrations of 2,3-DPG. The lack of 2,3-DPG shifts the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the left, the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen increases, and oxygen cannot be off-loaded at the tissue level. Second, they are nitric oxide scavengers and produce excessive vasoconstriction. Pulmonary hypertension and myocardial ischemia are risks; in fact, reports of death from myocardial infarction have delayed release of these solutions for general use. These solutions also result in platelet activation; release of proinflammatory mediators; methemoglobinemia; and, because of their color, interference with laboratory tests.",
