These new advances in DNA manipulation have been extended to the level of whole-genome synthesis, as evident from the synthesis of poliovirus, from the resurrection of the extinct 1918 strain of influenza virus and of human endogenous retroviruses and from the restructuring of the phage T7 genome. The largest DNA synthesized so far is the 582,970 base pair genome of Mycoplasma genitalium, although, as yet, this synthetic DNA has not been 'booted' to life. As genome synthesis is independent of a natural template, it allows modification of the structure and function of a virus's genetic information to an extent that was hitherto impossible. The common goal of this new strategy is to further our understanding of an organism's properties, particularly its pathogenic armory if it causes disease in humans, and to make use of this new information to protect from, or treat, human viral disease. Although only a few applications of virus synthesis have been described as yet, key recent findings have been the resurrection of the 1918 influenza virus and the generation of codon-and codon pair-deoptimized polioviruses.",

Synthetic biology depends on the collaboration of specialists from different disciplines, as it requires knowledge in molecular biology, computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics and chemistry. Of the papers discussed in this short Review, it is only the research efforts to refactor the genome of a bacteriophage 2 or to recode RNA viruses [3] [4] [5] that belong to the category of synthetic biology. It can be predicted with certainty, however, that this will rapidly change in the coming years. In the future, large-scale changes will be introduced into numerous viruses, allowing the creation of redesigned particles that can provide new insights into biology or the design of new vectors that can prevent or cure infectious diseases, cure genetic deficiencies by delivering genes or treat cancer through oncolytic mechanisms, to name but a few applications.",

In the 1980s, however, DNA synthesis went through a rapid transformation, with the introduction of novel activated nucleosides that allowed fully automated 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides (oligos) on solid supports13 , 14. In particular, phosphoramidites (that is, nucleotides that carry protective groups on the reactive hydroxyl and phosphate groups of the ribose and the amine of the base) have been the building blocks of choice. During the past 20 years, numerous DNA synthesis companies have been established in response to an exploding demand for oligos (~15-80 nucleotides (nt)) that are used for genetic analyses, PCR, diagnostic assays, sequence determination or other procedures. The turnaround time for an order of a 75-bp DNA, corresponding to yeast tRNA Ala , with extra base pairs at each end encoding restriction sites for subcloning, is currently less than 1 week-a fraction of the time and effort expended originally in Khorana's laboratory.",

It requires many oligos that must be purified, because their chemical synthesis is error prone (none of the successive chemical reactions during 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 chain elongation proceeds at 100%). For this reason, the building blocks for the assembly of large polynucleotides are generally no longer than 40-80 nt. Different approaches have been used to assemble oligos into large polynucleotides, although all have in common the processes of enzymatic chain elongation and/or ligation of hybridized overlapping oligos14 , 15. Examples are the 2.7-kbp plasmid containing the P-lactamase gene16 and the 4,917-kbp gene encoding the merozoite surface protein (MSP-1) of Plasmodium falciparum 17 . Currently, synthesizing genes or genomes is most cost efficient when done in part by commercial facilities, where the cost per base pair of finished and sequence-confirmed DNA is now as low $0.39 (E.W. and S.M., based on information obtained from an informal web survey).",

The virusspecific double-stranded DNA (cDNA), which was embedded into a plasmid, yielded authentic Q\u03b2 phage following transfection into bacteria. At the time, the authors concluded that the viral cDNA \"would allow genetic manipulations that cannot be carried out at the RNA level\" 31, 32, an understatement that revolutionized molecular biology of RNA viruses. Three years later, Racaniello and Baltimore33 repeated this experiment with poliovirus. Again, the virion RNA, embedded as cDNA into a plasmid, yielded authentic poliovirus in very poor yield when transfected into HeLa cells, a human cancer cell line that is optimal for poliovirus proliferation.",

The demonstrated role of the HA and PB1 genes in replication efficiency and virulence is particularly interesting because both genes were transferred by reassortment from an avian virus to the then-circulating human influenza virus, to generate the 1957 and 1968 pandemic strains. The acquisition of an avian influenza PB1 gene by reassortment might result in increased transcriptional activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and increased virus replication efficiency of a new pandemic strain49 ,81 . The HA and its binding preference for particular sialic acid (SA)-terminated glycans has also been implicated in efficient transmission of the 1918 virus in ferrets (T.M.T. et al.) 82 . It has been generally suspected that a switch in receptor-binding preference that confers efficient transmission among humans would be a necessary step for avian influenza viruses in the generation of a pandemic virus. Notably, we (T.M.T. and colleagues) have found that mutation of two amino acid residues (D190E, D225G) in the HA, which was previously identified as sufficient to switch the receptor-binding preference of parental 1918 HA (\u03b12,6 SA receptor preference) to the avian \u03b12,3 SA receptor preference 44, 83, prevented transmission among ferrets without affecting the replication efficiency of the rescued 1918 virus82.

Nevertheless, all of the ancient human retroviruses are degenerate, including the human mouse mammary tumor virus-like 2 provirus (HML-2) of the human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) K proviruses (HERV-K(HML-2)). The latter may have been added to the Old World primate genomes relatively recently in human evolution, but no functional proviruses able to produce infectious particles have been isolated.",

For example, in humans, the alanine codon GCC is used four times more frequently than the synonymous codon GCG. The cell's preference of one synonymous codon over another to specify the same amino acid is thought to relate to the abundance of the corresponding cognate tRNAs in the cell. Consequently, rare codons are associated with a suboptimal translation of an mRNA. Codon bias, then, may contribute to the restriction of the abundance of sequences encoding the same protein. Codons used frequently in the jellyfish may be used rarely in human cells, and thus expression of the jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP) in human cells is poor unless the codons of the jellyfish gene have been changed to those frequently used in human cells; accordingly, the GFP gene has been 'humanized' to achieve good expression in human cells 94 .",

In fact, the codon pair GCC GAA is strongly under-represented, despite containing the most frequent alanine codon, such that it is used only one-seventh as often as GCA GAG 4 . The functional significance of codon pair bias is a mystery, but it can be studied in systems, such as poliovirus, in which large-scale changes of codon pairing are likely to present with phenotypes in viral proliferation.",

In Figure 3 , the calculated CPB of a human gene is plotted against its amino acid length. Underrepresented codon pairs yield negative scores. Wild-type PV1(M) shows a slightly negative score (CPB = \u22120.02), but, not surprisingly, it uses codon-pairing corresponding to human genes (Fig. 3) . Using a custom-made computer optimization algorithm, we have constructed polioviruses whose P1 coding region had either a substantially negative codon pair bias, containing many underrepresented codon pairs (PV-Min, CPB = \u22120.474), or a substantially positive codon pair bias, containing many overrepresented codon pairs (PV-Max, CPB = +0.246; Fig. 2 ), while retaining the exact set of codons present in the wild-type virus 4 and the same amino acid sequence of P1.",

It had neither of these phenotypes. PV-Max, therefore, was not a highly virulent variant virus, an observation that suggests that the end product of evolution of poliovirus had already optimized the encoding of polypeptide P1 (ref. 4) and cannot be 'improved'. For an RNA virus, which exists as a quasi-species, this is not unexpected. The signature of poliovirus is the efficient replication of its small genome, which, under optimal conditions, is driven by an irresistible desire to maintain optimal genome structure; that is, during replication, important replication signals are constantly rebuilt, and unnecessary nucleotide sequences (for example, foreign genes and duplications) are deleted. Indeed, the virus has an inexhaustible arsenal to achieve these goals-by exploiting point mutations, by homologous or illegitimate recombination and even by the acquisition of foreign RNA sequences. These considerations do not mean that the sequence of PV-Max is the only other possible sequence that can express wild-type phenotypes in tissue culture and in CD155 tg mice. On the contrary, there are probably a huge number of sequences with wild-type phenotypes.",

Such a variant of a human pathogenic virus may enter the host by its normal route and replicate poorly, but still allow the host to mount an immune response strong enough to induce lasting protective immunity. In other words, a human virus with altered codon usage or altered codon pair usage could possibly serve as a vaccine. Recoding viral genomes, a process that we call 'synthetic attenuated virus engineering' (SAVE), may be a new and rapid route to discover vaccine candidates and prevent viral disease. Indeed, polioviruses harboring underrepresented codons or underrepresented codon pairs are attenuated in CD155 tg mice. Infection of these mice with a sublethal dose of codon-or codon pair-deoptimized viruses induced an immune response that protected the animals against a lethal dose of the wild-type virus 4, 5 .",

We also want to know to what extent computer-aided rational design can lead rapidly to vaccine candidates of a virus whose genetic and pathogenic properties are completely different from that of poliovirus. First, influenza virus is a negative-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome; on entry into the host cell the virion must activate its virus-associated RNA polymerase, which will synthesize genome-complementary RNA for translation and replication. Second, many of the important steps in influenza virus replication occur in the cell nucleus, an environment that is avoided by nearly all other RNA viruses (for example, poliovirus can replicate even in enucleated cells). Third, influenza virus is an enveloped virus that replicates in the respiratory tract. Although this work is still in progress, our results show that, by codon pair deoptimization, it is possible to rapidly construct highly attenuated influenza viruses that, after a single cycle of immunization, protect mice against a lethal dose of wildtype influenza virus (S.M., D. Papamichail, J.R. Coleman, S. Skiena and E.W., unpublished data). Most importantly, the best of the constructed vaccine candidate strains offer a wide margin of safety at a relatively low concentration of inoculating virus (S.M., D. Papamichail, J.R. Coleman, S.

In a separate approach, the Wimmer group (S.M., E.W. and colleagues) 5 has shuffled synonymous codons of the P1 region according to a specifically designed computer algorithm to maximize the number of nucleotide changes while retaining the existing codons (for example, without changing the codon bias). The resulting P1 sequence was synthesized and cloned into the backbone of poliovirus, yielding PV-SD5 (Fig. 2b) . The P1 coding region of PV-SD contained 934 changes out of 2,643 nucleotides; that is, on average, every third nucleotide was different from that of the wild-type sequence. Notably, PV-SD replicated in HeLa cells with wild-type kinetics 5 . Apparently, the positioning of the synonymous codons in PV-SD, after the extensive codon shuffle, did not influence viral protein synthesis, confirming that synonymous mutations have an effect on the virus only when they are specifically directed to lower the codon bias 5 or codon pair bias 4 . An intriguing conclusion from PV-SD is that, at the genome level, RNA viruses are promiscuous with respect to nucleotide changes, as long as these changes do not affect protein function or the rate of protein synthesis. In other words, RNA structures throughout much of the viral coding regions, with notable exceptions, such as cis-acting replication elements or encapsidation signals, are probably rather inconsequential.",

Such an experiment may not yield relevant results, because PV1(M) may also express a genetic drift.

Note that other human picornaviruses, such as rhinovirus type 14 (HRV14), do contain such an essential element (cre in HRV14-a stemloop structure of ~50 nt) in P1. Hence, HRV14-SD would have probably been nonviable 100 . The poliovirus equivalent to the HRV14 cre maps to the P2 coding region 101 . We expected that scrambling the P2 coding sequence of the poliovirus genome would destroy the cre element and kill the virus, which is indeed what we have found (Y. Song, C. Ward, D. Futcher, S.

Until recently, these methods have relied on PCR or RT-PCR amplification of templates from the pre-existing virus, followed by sub-cloning into the appropriate plasmid vectors, with or without mutagenesis, and such techniques will continue to be invaluable for virology and vaccinology. However, the advances in gene synthesis, coupled with the ability to use the techniques described in this Review, have allowed the production of viruses in the absence of available infectious virus. This has implications not only in terms of dual use (Box 1), but also for our understanding of evolution and the properties of important pathogens. Moreover, genome synthesis of both DNA and RNA viruses will lead to unprecedented possibilities in modifying naturally occurring genomes, thereby allowing new studies of viral genome architecture, viral gene expression and gene function.

Many of the negative reactions were tainted by fear that the poliovirus synthesis could aid bioterrorism. This was not surprising, as the news of the synthesis reached a public (particularly in the United States) that was highly sensitized to the threat of bioterrorism in the months following the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 and the anthrax attacks in Washington and elsewhere in 2001 and 2002. However, these concerns, led to numerous useful public debates about complex issues of biological research, scientific publication and national security105 -109. Notably, the synthesis of the bacteriophage \u03c6X174 genome in 2003, which stood out because of its speed of merely 2 weeks67, or the resurrection of the 1918 'Spanish' influenza virus in 2005 (ref. 80) , did not set off the shock waves experienced in 2002, when the poliovirus genome synthesis was published18. There may be two reasons for this. First, these later papers were embedded in numerous editorials or, as in the case of the \u03c6X174 synthesis, in a carefully orchestrated press conference called by the then US Secretary of Energy. These activities were aimed at explaining to the public the significance, particularly the benefit, of the research involving de novo virus synthesis. Second, compared to in 2002, the general public was probably better prepared and better educated to accept the new reality of synthetic viruses and their possible consequences 53 . Meanwhile, several publications, of which only a few can be cited [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] , attest to the serious efforts by the scientific community to define dual-use research and to limit its possible disastrous consequences. and AI15122 and contract N65236 from the US Defense Advanced Research Project Agency to E.W.; and partially by the intramural research program of the NIH and the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

(a) Poliovirus genomic RNA56 ,91 is of plus-strand polarity (that is, it functions as mRNA in viral replication). It is covalently linked at the 5\u2032 end to the small viral protein VPg (3B of the polyprotein), followed by a long 5\u2032 nontranslated region (5\u2032 NTR), a continuous open reading frame (ORF), a 3\u2032 NTR and poly (A). The 5\u2032 NTR consists of structural elements that control RNA replication (cloverleaf) and translation (the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)). The ORF encodes the polyprotein, the single translation product of the viral mRNA. The polyprotein is proteolytically processed by viral proteinases 2A pro and 3C/3CD pro into functional proteins, which have been divided into the structural region (P1 and the capsid precursors) and the nonstructural regions P2 and P3 The codon pair bias (CPB) score for each of the 14,795 annotated human genes was calculated 4 . Each dot represents the calculated CPB score of one gene plotted against its amino acid (aa) length. Predominant use of underrepresented codon pairs yields negative CPB scores. Various poliovirus constructs are plotted according to the CPB score of their P1 capsid precursor protein. As the CPB decreases, translatability decreases and the attenuation effect on the virus increases. PV-Min is nonviable; PV-Max expresses replication and virulence phenotypes similar to those of wild-type PV. Adapted from ref. 4 .",

In PV-AB capsids, the use of nonpreferred codons was maximized. The length of the bars and the numbers behind each bar indicate the occurrence of each codon in the sequence. As a reference, the normal human synonymous codon frequencies for each amino acid are given",

BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 10 5 PFU of virus to determine which virus genes of the 1918 virus contributed to virulence. Among all eight gene segments tested individually, the HA gene was the only 1918 virus gene able to confer a virulent phenotype when rescued on the genetic background of Tx/91 H1N1 virus. In the reciprocal experiments, the exchange of most of the individual 1918 influenza virus genes with seasonal influenza Tx/91 virus genes did not alter the virulence of the lethal 1918 virus; however, substitution of the HA, NA or PB1 genes substantially affected the ability of this virus to cause severe disease in mice.
