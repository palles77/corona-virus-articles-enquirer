The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR were confirmed using tissue culture-adapted BCV strains and feces of 2 calves inoculated with BCV. Ten nonpregant, BCV seropositive, adult dairy cows were inoculated with winter dysentery (WD) (n = 8) or calf diarrhea (CD) (n = 2) strains of BCV intranasally and orally (n = 2) or through a surgically-placed duodenal catheter (n = 8) with and without dexamethasone treatment or feeding ice water. The 6 cows inoculated with BCV intranasally and through a duodenal catheter (2 of 2 cows given CD BCV and 4 of 6 cows given WD BCV) developed mild diarrhea, and BCV was detected in diarrheal feces by RT-PCR, ELISA or immune electron microscopy. These results suggest that CD and WD strains of BCV can cause diarrhea in adult cows in conjunction with host or environmental factors and that RT-PCR might be useful to diagnose BCV infections in calves and adult cows. * Bovine coronavirus (BCV) is an important pathogen of neonatal calf diarrhea (CD) [5] . The virus also has been isolated from adult cattle experiencing acute diarrhea during outbreaks of winter dysentery (WD) [19] . In a recent study individ- * Present address:",

Recently, we also detected some antigenic and biological diversity among BCV strains, but these variations were unrelated to the clinical source of the strains; i.e. CD or WD [26] . Also we reported complete cross-protection and no differences in the pathogenicity between selected WD and CD BCV strains in experimentally infected gnotobiotic and colostrum-deprived calves [10] . However, the infectivity and pathogenicity of CD and WD BCV for adult cows is unclear. Electron microscopy (EM) is often used for the identification of BCV in feces [2, 6] . However, sometimes it is difficult to identify BCV in feces by EM because pleomorphic membranous particles resembling coronaviruses are common in feces [19] .

Ten of these were inoculated with BCV and the remaining one was a non-inoculated control. These cows were housed separately in an infectious disease isolation facility, where temperature was controlled at about 20 \u2022 C, and hay and concentrate were fed during the experiments. These cows possessed antibodies to BCV by previous natural infection before challenge, and BCV was not detected from daily feces by ELISA and immune electron microscopy (IEM) at leat 1 week prior to the start of the experiments. A 20% suspension of the intestinal contents containing the DBA, DB2 or 216XF strain of BCV was administered using 10 ml intranasally and 90 ml through a surgically-placed duodenal catheter (Supraflex Trocar Catheter; Rusch Inc) (8 cows) or alternatively, given orally (2 cows) ( Table 1 ). The surgery on the duodenal catheter was done at least 1 week before the experiments. Six cows received serial injections of dexamethasone (Schering-Plough Animal Health Corporation) (DM; 50 mg/day) intramuscularly for 5 days prior to or after BCV challenge (Table 1 ). Forty liters of ice water were given to 2 cows through an intranasal catheter 2 times in the previous day and on the day of challenge. After inoculation of cows with BCV, feces and nasal swab specimens were collected daily, blood samples were collected at challenge and 14 to 21 days later, and clinical signs were observed through post-inoculation days (PID) 14 to 21 except for one cow (cow 5) euthanized at PID 4. One noninoculated control cow (cow 11) received serial injections of DM (50 mg/day) for 5 days and 40 liters of ice water for 2 days at the last day of DM treatment and for the next day. Feces and nasal swab specimens were collected from this cow for 19 days from the first day of DM treatment, blood samples were collected at the last day of DM treatment and 14 days later, and clinical signs were observed for 19 days from the first day of DM treatment. Feces were diluted 1:10 in 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) for ELISA and IEM and 1:2 for RT-PCR. Nasal epithelial cells were collected from nasal swab specimens and were used for direct immunofluorescence (IF) tests. One colostrum-deprived calf (28day-old) and a gnotobiotic calf (7-day-old) were inoculated oronasally with the DB2 and DBA strains of BCV, respectively.

The tissue culture-adapted viruses were used directly without RNA extraction. The primers for BCV were designed from the published sequence of the nucleocapsid gene of the Mebus strain [12] . The sequences of primers (positions calculated from the start codon of the nucleocapsid gene) were as follows: upstream primer 5 -GCCGATCAGTCCGACCAATC-3 (position, 92-111); downstream primer, 5 -AGAATGTCAGCCGGGGTAT-3 (position, 498-480). The predicted PCR product was 407 base pairs. The reverse transcriptase reaction was conducted by the following procedure. In the tube, 5 l of RNA sample was added to 2 l of the downstream primer (50 pmol) and 4 l of water. The tube was incubated at 100 The PCR products were visualized on 1.2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Ten virus-negative feces collected from preexposure gnotobiotic or colostrum-deprived calves were used as negative controls.",

All 14 stains of BCV including the DBA, DB2 and 216XF which were used for cow inoculations, and the deer coronaviruses were detected by RT-PCR, suggesting that the sequences of the primers used in this study were conserved among these BCV strains. The RT-PCR was more sensitive than ELISA and IEM to detect BCV in the feces of experimentally inoculated calves. For the majority of feces from the cows, samples positive by ELISA or IEM were also positive by RT-PCR. These results indicated that the RT-PCR developed might be useful for diagnosis of BCV infections in calves and adult cows. However, the feces of cow 10 at PID 3 to 6 were positive for BCV by ELISA and IEM, but not by RT-PCR. These negative results might be caused by the presence of inhibitory substances for PCR present in the feces of this animal [30] .",

Especially, stress factors, such as dietary changes, parturition, lactation, chilling due to low environmental temperature or cold drinking water, or wide fluctuations in temperatures might play an important role in initiating the disease. Also, the immune status of cows [23] and mixed infections of BCV with other microorganisms might be contributory factors to the disease. At first, we tried to inoculate the virus oronasally to 2 cows, as was done previously for gnotobiotic or colostrumdeprived calves [10] , but these cows did not show any clinical signs, virus shedding or increased serum antibody responses to BCV. These results indicate that unlike in calves [10] , it is difficult to reproduce diarrhea in seropositive adult cows challenged with BCV via the oronasal route. In contrast, 6 of 8 cows inoculated through a duodenal catheter developed diarrhea and shed BCV in diarrheal feces. Viral inoculation via the duodenum excluded the adverse effects of rumen microorganisms and gastric acids in the abomasum on BCV. Certain stress factors, such as mentioned previously, may change the number and composition of rumen microorganisms, or increase the pH of the abomasum and influence BCV infectivity in the field. Immune suppression induced by DM treatment influenced the occurrence of diarrhea and virus shedding in our BCV challenge exposure studies, although exceptions occurred. For example, cow 4 began to show diarrhea and virus shedding during DM treatment. The DM treatment causes deleterious effects on mucosal immune responses as reported previously [16, 18] and likely also compromises mucosal immune responses and host resistance to BCV. We gave a large volume of ice water to 2 cows as a stress inducer before inoculation and one of them was also treated with DM before inoculation. Both cows showed diarrhea and virus shedding, but there were no major differences between the 2 cows in the degree of diarrhea and the duration of virus shedding. However it was interesting that ice water treatment alone in cow 9 also resulted in BCV infection and diarrhea.",

Based on epidemiological data, these disease syndromes often occur as separate and distinct outbreaks in herds; therefore differences in pathogenicity and antigenicity between CD and WD BCV might be expected [9, 13, 19] . However, isolates of WD BCV were reported to produce bloody diarrhea [17] or watery diarrhea [10] in newborn calves. Our previous results indicated that the degree of diarrhea and the patterns of fecal and nasal shedding of BCV were indistinguishable between the CD DB2 and WD DBA strains based on crossprotection studies in calves [10] , suggesting that WD BCV strains cause diarrhea in calves. Also, there were no relationships between the antigenic and biological diversity among BCV strains and the clinical sources (WD and CD) of the strains [26] . In this study, 2 of 2 cows inoculated with the DB2 or 216XF strain of CD BCV, and 4 of 6 cows inoculated with the DBA strain of WD BCV via a doudenal catheter developed diarrhea and shed virus. These results suggest that CD and WD BCV can cause diarrhea in adult cows in combination with host or environmental factors, and these factors might contribute to the separate and distinct nature of the WD and CD outbreaks.",
