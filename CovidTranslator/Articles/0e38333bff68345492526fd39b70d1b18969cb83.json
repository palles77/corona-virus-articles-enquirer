Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 detection on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning-based software system was developed using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID-19. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious. 499 CT volumes collected from Dec. 13, 2019, to Jan. 23, 2020, were used for training and 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were used for testing. The deep learning algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. There was an operating point with 0.907 sensitivity and 0.911 specificity in the ROC curve. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weaklysupervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and highperformance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. The developed deep learning software is available at https://github.com/sydney0zq/covid-19-detection.",

Thus, performing COVID-19 detection in a weakly-supervised manner is of great importance.

Therefore, aim of current study was to investigate the potential of a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 detection on chest CT volumes using the weak patient-level label, for the sake of rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 at this critical situation to help to counter this outbreak, especially within Wuhan, Hubei province, China.",

Finally, 540 patients (mean age, 42.5\u00b116.1 years; range, 3-81 years, male 226, female 314) were enrolled into this study, including 313 patients (mean age, 50.7\u00b114.7 years; range, 8-81 years; male 138, female 175) with clinical diagnosed COVID-19 (COVID-positive group) and 229 patients (mean age, 31.2\u00b110.0 years; range, 3-69 years; male 88, female 141) without COVID-19 (COVID-negative group).

As shown in Fig. 1 , DeCoVNet took a CT volume and its 3D lung mask as input. The 3D lung mask was generated by a pre-trained UNet [19] . DeCoVNet was divided into three stages for a clear illustration in Table. 1. The first stage was the network stem, which consisted of a vanilla 3D convolution with a kernel size of 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7, a batchnorm layer and a pooling layer. The second stage was composed of two 3D residual blocks (ResBlocks). In each ResBlock, a 3D feature map was passed into both a 3D convolution with a batchnorm layer and a shortcut connection containing a 3D convolution that was omitted in Fig. 1 for dimension alignment. The resulted feature maps were added in an element-wise manner. The third stage was a progressive classifier (ProClf), which mainly contained three 3D convolution layers and a fully-connected (FC) layer with the softmax activation function. ProClf progressively abstracts the information in the CT volumes by 3D max-pooling and finally directly output the probabilities of being COVID-positive and COVID-negative. The 3D lung mask of an input chest CT volume helped to reduce background information and better detect COVID-19. Detecting the 3D lung mask was a well-studied issue. In this study, we trained a simple 2D UNet using the CT images in our training set. To obtain the ground-truth lung masks, we 4 .

After that, all the CT volumes were resampled into a same spatial resolution (e.g., 368\u00d7368), by which the CT volumes could be aligned without the influence of the cylindrical scanning bounds of CT scanners.

Though there were many effective applications of medical AI in previous studies [13, 23] , developing AI for automatic COVID-19 detection was still a challenging task. Firstly, in the current emergency situation, the number of enrolled patients is relatively smaller compared with that used in previous studies [13, 23] ; and patients enrolled in our study were clinically diagnosed cases with COVID-19, because the majority of them did not undergo the nucleic acid testing due to the sudden outbreak and limited medical resource in such a short time period. Secondly, the lesions of COVID-19 in CT volumes were not labeled by radiologists and only patientlevel labels (i.e., COVID-positive or COVID-negative) were utilized for training the AI algorithm in our study. Thirdly, some small infected areas of COVID-19 have the potential to be missed even by professional radiologists, and whether it is feasible to be detected by deep learning-based 3D DCNN model remains unclear. We hypothesized to solve these problems by proposing a delicate 3D DCNN, i.e., DeCoVNet. It solved the first problem by applying extensive data augmentation on training CT volumes to obtain more training examples. The second problem was solved by regarding the COVID-19 detection problem as a weakly-supervised learning problem [24] , i.e., detecting COVID-19 without annotating the regions of COVID-19 lesions. In the designed DeCoVNet, we used the spatially global pooling layer and the temporally global pooling layer to technically handle the weakly-supervised COVID-19 detection problem. The third problem was addressed by taking the advantages of deep learning and utilizing a pre-trained UNet for providing the lung masks to guide the learning of DeCoVNet.",

            "text": "Limitations of this study There are still several limitations in this study. First, network design and training may be further improved. For example, the UNet model for lung segmentation did not utilize temporal information and it was trained using imperfect ground-truth masks, which could be improved by using 3D segmentation networks and adopting precise ground-truth annotated by experts. Second, the data used in this study came from a single hospital and cross-center validations were not performed. Third, when diagnosing COVID-19, the algorithm worked in a black-box manner, since the algorithm was based on deep learning and its explainability was still at an early stage. Related work of all limitations mentioned above will be addressed in our further studies.",

DeCoVNet was trained under the supervision of clinical ground-truth labels (COVID-positive and COVID-negative). Lastly, the trained DeCoVNet made predictions on the testing set.",

CZ, XD and HM collected, anonymized, and prepared the data from Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China. XD and QF contributed to the protocol of the study. XW and QF did the statistical analysis. XW, QF and QZ wrote the initial draft. All authors subsequently critically edited the report. All authors read and approved the final report. CZ, XD, QF, HM, QZ and XW had full access to all data in the study. CZ, XD, LW and XW had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.Funding This study was in part funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (No. 61876212 and No. 61733007).
