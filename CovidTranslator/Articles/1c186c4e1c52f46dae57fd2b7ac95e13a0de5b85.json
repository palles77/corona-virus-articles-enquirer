The physical properties of the BC/ POM composites were examined using FTIR, UV-Vis spectroscope, 31 P MAS-NMR, SEM and TEM. These techniques indicated that the POM was intact on the surface of the BC matrix after impregnation. The POM particle size was found to be less than 150 nm based on TEM. The antibacterial effects of the BC/ POM composites were assessed from the zone of inhibition, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and plate-counting method, and an excellent antibacterial performance was discovered.",

POMs perform significant biological activities, with high efficacy and low toxicity. In particular, the sizes and globular structural motifs of many POMs are similar, and in some cases nearly identical to some watersoluble fullerene derivatives showing fairly good anti-HIV activity (human immunodeficiency virus) [6] [7] [8] . So far, various biological effects of the POMs have been reported on antitumor and antivirus activities [9, 10] . With regard to the antibacterial activity of the POMs, we found that the polyoxometalates with Keggin, lacunary Keggin, Wells-Dawson, double-Keggin and Keggin-sandwich structures enhanced the antibacterial activity of b-lactam antibiotics on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [11] , Helicobacter pylori [12] and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [13] .",

A number of attempts have been made to disperse POMs on inert supports, with the goal of effectively increasing their surface areas and hence the number of accessible active catalytic sites. Several materials such as carbon [14] , zirconia [15] , titania [16] , alumina [17] and porous silica [18, 19] have been used as solid supports for the dispersion of POMs. To find a suitable support able to attach itself firmly and to disperse the POMs would be of great practical interest because catalytic activity will be related to the higher surface area and to the thermal stability of the supported heteropolyanion.",

Approximately 10 7 CFU of S. aureus were cultured on MH agar plates supplemented with BC/POM composites. BC/POM-free MH plates cultured under the same conditions were used as a control. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18 h and the numbers of colonies were counted. The test process was described as follows: 60 mg of the BC/POM composites were added into 3 ml of MH broth containing 10 7 CFU/ml bacteria. The mixture was aerobically incubated at 37\u00b0C under vibration for 24 h. The above suspension (30 ll) was cultured on an agar plate and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18 h. [25] . It has been reported that when POM is bound to a support, a shift in the band position due to the Keggin complex is observed, resulting from a change in the chemical environment and the number and types of counterions [26] . As shown in Fig. 1 , BC/POM samples, the absorption bands assigned to the M-O c -M and M-O e -M stretching at 865 and 780 cm \u00c01 , respectively, are shifted to 873 and 800 cm \u00c01 . These results indicate that there were interactions between the BC particles and the POM. Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis spectra of the POM and BC/POM composites. The UV-vis spectra of POM and BC/POM composites dissolved in solution show prominent bands at 217 and 309 nm, its intensity distinctly increased with increasing POM content. These bands are generally assigned to charge transfer from the bridging oxygen to the metal in polyoxometalates [27] . 31 P MAS-NMR is a useful tool in detecting the local environments of POM, since the chemical shift of the phosphorous atom depends not only on its local environment within the metal cluster but also on factors such as associated water molecules, metal ions and solid supports [28] . Fig. 3 shows the 31 P MAS-NMR spectra of unsupported bulk POM and BC/POM composites. All the samples displayed more than one phosphorus resonance, which indicates that the structure is complex. Bulk POM exhibited a sharp and in-1400 1300 1200 1100 1000 900 800 700 600 500 400 tense peak at \u00c03.3 ppm along with shoulders at \u00c02.3 and \u00c04.2 ppm, typical of Keggin structures [28] . The main peak indicates the presence of P in a highly uniform environment in a hydrated structure of POM. The small shoulders at \u00c02.3 and \u00c04.2 ppm are due to the presence of some P atoms in environments with different degrees of hydration [19] . After supporting POM on BC, the 31 P NMR signals broadened considerably and shifted to high field (d = \u00c03.9 and \u00c07.9 ppm). The up-field shift of the resonance signal suggests some destruction of the heteropolyanion. Therefore, the broadness of the 31 P NMR resonances of supported samples can be attributed to a significant distortion of the heteropolyanion symmetry and the long-range order created by water molecules in the hydrated state is lost, due to a chemical interaction between the POM anion and mesoporous BC support [19] . SEM and TEM images were used to evaluate the surface morphology and size distribution of the POM deposited on the BC surface. As shown in Fig. 4 , ultra-fine and disaggregated POM particles were homogeneously distributed on the surface of the BC. Pure BC has a porous surface (Fig. 4A) . The POM particles are granular in nature and seem to be nanosized, typically in the range of <100 nm (Fig. 4D) . EDX analysis confirmed the existence of POM in the BC matrix and qualitatively revealed the POM nanoparticles content (Fig. 4E) . Table 1 gives the POM content, S BET and pore diameter of each BC/POM composite, and shows that POM content increased with increasing initial concentration of POM solution, pore diameter of the BC/POM composites was about 3.40 nm, and S BET of the BC/POM composites decreased with increasing POM content, due to the direct blockage of pores by POM particles. Particle size and S BET can be controlled by changing the POM content. Too small a value of S BET will lead to weak adsorption capability, rendering the BC/POM composite useless in the purification process. Thus, as the antibacterial activity of BC/POM composites is significantly influenced by the loading amount of POM on the BC particles, further studies should be performed to estimate the amount of POM required to suppress bacterial growth and ensure strong adsorption capability.",

            "text": "The antibacterial efficacy of the BC/POM composites against bacteria was tested based on zone of inhibition tests, MIC, MBC and the plate-counting method. Fig. 5 and Table 2 detail the relative retention of activity (zone of inhibition) of BC and the BC/ POM composites against bacteria. After 24 h of incubation, the zones of inhibition of the BC/POM composites against bacteria ranged from 9.4 to 27.0 mm, whereas BC did not show any zone of inhibition. The BC/POM composites exhibited significant efficacy against bacteria, especially against S. aureus, MRSA and E. coli JM109, and the efficacy increased with increasing POM content. The results in Tables 3 and 4 show that the composites have good efficacy against these bacteria. The MIC and MBC values of the BC/ POM composites against bacteria were 4-128 lg/ml and 16-256 lg/ml, respectively. The BC/POM composites have a strong antibacterial activity regardless of gram class, including Ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA), E. coli JM109 and Methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA), which are much more difficult to kill. Thus, it is likely that the highly negative charge of POM will stimulate the cell to result in the easiness of the bacterial morphological change from bacillary form to coccid form, reflecting the bacterial death [12] . In addition, the antibacterial efficacy of the BC/POM composites was better than that of zeolite/Ag (MIC: 256-2048 lg/ml) [29] . This result may be due to the uniform and fine POM particles distribution on the surface of the BC. The antibacterial effect, evaluated by the plate-counting method, of the BC/POM composites against bacteria is shown in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. Fig. 6 shows the relationship between samples and the number of bacterial colonies grown in the presence of 20 mg/ml of BC/POM composites. In all these samples, the particles caused a growth delay of S. aureus, and increasing the POM loading amount of the composite increased this growth delay. As demonstrated in Fig. 6E , the bacterial colonies of S. aureus were completely killed after 18 h of incubation in BC/POM-3 composite. The dynamics of bacterial growth were also monitored in liquid MH medium supplemented with 10 7 CFU S. aureus cells and with 50 mg/ml of BC/POM-1 inoculated for different lengths of time. Fig. 7 shows that the bacterial colonies of gram-positive S. aureus were completely killed after 24 h of inoculation and the percentage reduction of bacteria was approximately 100% after 8-60 h of inoculation. The mechanism for the antibacterial activity of the POM against gram-negative strains has been considered as follows: the fluorescent X-ray analysis results showed the uptake of the POM into the bacterial cell. The gram-negative strains can take the hydrophilic compounds into the periplasmic space through the porin protein, which is pore-form protein working for penetration of the hydrophilic compounds in the outer membrane [12] .",
