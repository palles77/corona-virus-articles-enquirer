IFITM proteins also incorporate into HIV-1 virions and inhibit virus fusion and cell-to-cell spread, with IFITM3 showing the greatest potency. Here, we report that amino-terminal mutants of IFITM3 preventing ubiquitination and endocytosis are more abundantly incorporated into virions and exhibit enhanced inhibition of HIV-1 fusion. An analysis of primate genomes revealed that IFITM3 is the most ancient antiviral family member of the IFITM locus and has undergone a repeated duplication in independent host lineages. Some IFITM3 genes in nonhuman primates, including those that arose following gene duplication, carry amino-terminal mutations that modify protein localization and function. This suggests that \"runaway\" IFITM3 variants could be selected for altered antiviral activity. Furthermore, we show that adaptations in IFITM3 result in a trade-off in antiviral specificity, as variants exhibiting enhanced activity against HIV-1 poorly restrict influenza A virus. Overall, we provide the first experimental evidence that diversification of IFITM3 genes may boost the antiviral coverage of host cells and provide selective functional advantages.",

The establishment of a hostile intracellular environment sets the stage for ongoing host-virus coevolution, a phenomenon that is particularly well characterized between primates and lentiviruses [2] .

We showed that IFITM proteins, in particular IFITM3, block the spread of HIV-1 from infected to uninfected T cells. Surprisingly, this function was primarily the result of interactions occurring between IFITM3 and virus in the infected cells. We found that IFITM3 in the virus-producing cell decreases virion infectivity at the level of viruscell fusion and that IFITM3 becomes incorporated into nascent virions. This mechanism of antiviral function may apply to other lentiviruses as well as diverse families of enveloped viruses. Therefore, IFITM proteins are restriction factors of increasingly broad scope.",

In fact, IFITM3 can be observed at many different subcellular compartments and its localization is regulated by various post-translational modifications [25] . The fate of IFITM3 is governed by phosphorylation [16, 26] , ubiquitination [27] , palmitoylation [27, 28] , and methylation [29] . These regulatory processes impact the localization and turnover of IFITM3 in the cell, and as a result, they are critical to its antiviral function. During biosynthesis, IFITM3 protein is trafficked to the plasma membrane and endocytosed. This latter step is driven by an internalization motif (Yxx\u03a6, YEML in human IFITM3) that is recognized by the lB unit of the AP-2 complex, resulting in the sorting of IFITM3 into late endosomes, multivesicular bodies, and lysosomes [26, 30] . Furthermore, an overlapping motif (PPxY, PPNY in human IFITM3) recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 to promote IFITM3 ubiquitination and turnover via lysosomes [31] . Phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 20 (Y20) common to the two motifs inhibits both endocytosis and ubiquitination, causing an accumulation of IFITM3 and redistribution to the plasma membrane [26] . Mutation or deletion of Y20 produces a similar effect [30] . Interestingly, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs12252-C) in human IFITM3 is predicted to produce an alternatively spliced transcript that encodes a protein lacking these two regulatory motifs. This putative truncated form of IFITM3 (D1-21) is largely confined to the plasma membrane when expressed in cell lines [16] . Intriguingly, rs12252-C is associated with severe outcomes following IAV infection [20, [32] [33] [34] . These epidemiologic studies coincide with in vitro experiments showing that IFITM3 D1-21 fails to accumulate in the endosomal compartment, where IAV undergoes pH-dependent fusion to access the cytoplasm. However, endogenous expression of the putative truncated form of human IFITM3 has not been demonstrated to date. While these previous reports reveal how synthetic mutations in IFITM3 affect the restriction of RNA viruses such as IAV and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), it remains unclear how they may regulate the activity against other viruses with different cell entry strategies. Furthermore, very little is known about natural, genome-encoded mutations that may affect IFITM function in diverse animal species.",

Given that the amount of IFITM3 at the cell surface most likely dictates its ability to restrict HIV-1 entry and the infectivity of nascent budding virions, we hypothesized that posttranslational modifications affecting cell surface association will impact the activity of IFITM3 against HIV-1. Here, we report that endocytosis and ubiquitination are negative regulators of IFITM3 anti-HIV activity. Furthermore, we show that post-translational regulation of IFITM3 may result in a functional trade-off: alterations that improve the function against one virus can inhibit its activity against other viruses. As a testament to their functional importance, periodic diversification of residues within the two regulatory motifs of IFITM3 is observed during primate evolution, resulting in variants with different potency and specificity. Finally, our multifaceted analysis has allowed us to retrace the origins of IFITM in primates and provides an explanation for the recurrent gene duplication observed in this antiviral gene family.",

As previously described [16] , the subcellular localization of the D1-21 variant is mostly restricted to the plasma membrane ( Fig 1B) . A mutant deficient in cysteine residues (referred to as Dpalm because it prevents palmitoylation of IFITM3 [27] ) results in a predominantly perinuclear localization with additional diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasm. Western blot and flow cytometric analysis reveal quantitative differences in protein expression.

Consistent with its enhanced localization to the cell surface, which also serves as the site for virus assembly and budding, the D1-21 variant exhibits increased levels of virion incorporation relative to full-length IFITM3 ( Fig 1E) . Importantly, viruses produced in the presence of the D1-21 variant are further reduced in virion infectivity when incubated with fresh SupT1 T-cell targets, as evidenced by reduced virus-cell fusion at 4 h ( Fig 1F) and reduced productive viral infection at 48 h ( Fig 1G) . Virus produced in the presence of MxA was used as an additional negative control. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy confirms that surface-associated IFITM3 can be localized to sites of HIV-1 budding tagged by the presence of mature Gag protein (Fig EV1B) . Results with an IFITM3 mutant encoding a single residue deletion at position 20 (DY20) reproduced those of D1-21, strongly suggesting that the tyrosine residue and the two overlapping regulatory motifs to which it belongs are crucial to the enhancement of anti-HIV activity observed (Fig EV1C-E) . Thus, the extent of inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity is associated with cell surface localization and the increased detection of IFITM3 in virions. We previously demonstrated that IFITM1, which naturally lacks the amino-terminus present in IFITM3, only modestly restricts HIV-1 infectivity [21] . Thus, the absence of an amino-terminus per se is not sufficient to enhance anti-HIV-1 activity. Rather, IFITM3 contains other intrinsic determinants that enable a potent HIV-1 restriction that can be amplified by the removal of its aminoterminus.",

Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed previously published results [16] showing that D17-20 is enriched at the cell surface ( Fig 1H) . Similar to D1-21, the D17-18 mutant exhibits slightly elevated protein levels relative to full-length IFITM3. Importantly, the D17-20 variant does not share this feature, and it is even expressed at lower levels relative to full-length IFITM3 (Figs 1I and EV1F). Both the D17-18 and D17-20 variants display an increased propensity for virion incorporation, with the mutant in which endocytosis is disrupted (D17- 20) showing the greatest phenotype ( Fig 1J) . Consistently, the D17-20 variant demonstrates the most profound inhibition of HIV-1 particle fusogenicity ( Fig 1K) and infectivity ( Fig EV1G) . Therefore, the enhancement of IFITM3 antiviral activity is associated with its subcellular localization and is not solely dependent on protein levels. When we employed a L23Q mutant to inhibit protein endocytosis [26] without disturbing the NEDD4-binding motif, we found that this single amino acid change also results in more pronounced restriction of HIV-1 infectivity relative to wild-type IFITM3 (Fig EV1H and I) . These results collectively suggest that motifs interacting with endogenous NEDD4 and AP-2 act in an additive fashion to negatively regulate the anti-HIV activity of IFITM3.",

The co-expression of NEDD4 resulted in lower levels of IFITM3 in cell lysates, an effect that was not observed for the catalytically inactive NEDD4 mutant C867A ( Fig EV2A) . These results confirm that NEDD4-mediated ubiquitination accelerates the turnover of IFITM3 [31] . Moreover, NEDD4 co-expression diminished the levels of IFITM3 incorporated into HIV-1 virions (Fig EV2A) . In contrast to its typical expression pattern in the cytoplasm and on the cell surface, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that IFITM3 becomes mostly intracellular in cells co-expressing NEDD4, but not in those with inactive NEDD4 C867A (Fig EV2B and C) . NEDD4 induced the accumulation of IFITM3 in large vesicular compartments that partially colocalize with LAMP1 ( Fig EV2D) . In contrast, protein levels of the D1-21 variant in cell lysates or in virions were unaffected by NEDD4, and the localization remained predominantly cell surface oriented (Fig EV3D) . Collectively, these findings suggest that NEDD4 regulates IFITM3 levels in cells producing HIV-1 and thus may regulate its antiviral effect. They also highlight how variants of IFITM3 missing key elements of the amino-terminus may confer escape from NEDD4 and lead to enhanced antiviral function in the cell.",

However, and consistent with our previous publication [21] , the induction of IFITM3 or the D1-21 variant did not affect gp120 levels in virions produced in T-cell lines (Fig 2D) . To explore further the effect of IFITM3 on HIV-1 Env in virus-producing cells, we co-transfected 293T cells with HIV-1 pNL4-3 and titrating amounts of plasmid encoding IFITM3, the D1-21 variant, or MxA. We observed that gp120 levels were slightly reduced only at the highest level of IFITM3 overexpression (Fig 2E) . The D1-21 variant reduced gp120 levels somewhat further in a manner consistent with its elevated expression, while MxA overexpression had no effect. Interestingly, we also found that reduction in gp120 was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in HIV-1 p24 levels, possibly suggestive of a global effect on virus translation ( Fig 2E) . Therefore, while IFITM3mediated restriction of HIV-1 infectivity may involve Env antagonism, this effect is cell type dependent and expression level dependent. We propose that the mechanistic basis for IFITM3 antiviral function against HIV-1 lies primarily with its cell surface localization, which is associated with its incorporation into virions budding from the same compartment.",

To build a comprehensive understanding of IFITM evolution in primates, we used comparative genomics to identify IFITM genes from full reference genomes. Aided by the Genomicus toolkit [39] and the Ensembl gene database (www.ensembl.org), we characterized the IFITM locus in simian and prosimian primate species. Simians consist of haplorhine primates, including hominoids (humans, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon), Old World Monkeys [rhesus macaque, olive baboon, and vervet monkey (African Green Monkey)], and New World Monkeys (common marmoset), while prosimians consist of strepsirrhine primates (mouse lemur and bushbaby) as well as a Tarsiiforme relict species (tarsier). This analysis yielded several novel insights into IFITM evolution. First, the \"canonical\" IFITM gene locus found in humans is atypical with regard to gene number and gene composition. For example, the IFITM locus of the prosimian bushbaby species is syntenic with that of humans, but it does not contain IFITM1 or IFITM2. Instead, it contains two adjacent copies of IFITM3 resulting from gene duplication (a third copy of IFITM3, also the product of gene duplication, is located on a separate chromosome) (Fig 3A) . In fact, while the last common primate ancestor (LCPA) is predicted to contain only three IFITM genes, primate evolution is punctuated by IFITM gene gain and gene loss events (Fig 3B) . Many of the modern primate genomes analyzed show evidence of IFITM3 gene duplication, while the tarsier contains only a single IFITM gene, and it is IFITM3 (Fig 3B) . The number of IFITM3 genes listed for each species is a minimal estimate, as we only considered IFITM3 sequences predicted to be protein coding by Ensembl (sequences containing an intact open reading frame and lacking premature stop codons). These data suggest that IFITM3 is the oldest of the IFITM family members with known antiviral activities. Furthermore, the genomes of hominoids (apes) revealed that IFITM2 is a relatively recent genetic innovation specific to humans, chimpanzee, and gorilla ( Fig 3B) . Overall, the evolutionary trajectory of IFITM in primates suggests a recurrent need for functional diversification.",

The suborder and parvorder (from left to right) indicate taxonomical relationships between species. Residues bolded in red highlight nonsynonymous substitutions that disrupt canonical motifs for the recruitment of NEDD4 and AP-2. A complete protein alignment of all IFITM sequences analyzed in this study is available in Appendix. B A phylogenetic gene tree (cladogram) indicates the relationship among IFITM3 sequences analyzed in this study. The final consensus tree was made by merging results from neighbor joining and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic reconstructions using both nucleotide and amino acid sequences in Ensembl (see Fig EV4 for robustness measurement by Bayesian inference). Branch lengths are normalized and arbitrary. The size of triangles at the tree tips roughly corresponds to the number of sequences contained therein. Note that the IFITM2 gene is the most recent member of the IFITM locus, appearing only in humans, chimpanzee, and gorilla genomes. C A graphical representation of naturally occurring truncated forms of IFITM3 identified in the vervet and marmoset reference genomes, as compared to the putative D1-21 variant in humans. Fig S1) . These cases of IFITM3 duplication and divergence were not isolated to far-removed primate species, since we also found similar patterns in the catarrhine parvorder to which humans belong. We identified a single IFITM3 sequence in the colobus monkey that contains a deletion (D22-24) eliminating the motif necessary for AP-2-mediated endocytosis as well as a neighboring lysine residue (K24) targeted for ubiquitination [27] (Fig 4A) . Furthermore, codons 17 and 18 of IFITM3, corresponding to the critical proline residues necessary for its interaction with and ubiquitination by NEDD4 [31] , have diversified in IFITM3 genes in the vervet, gorilla, and orangutan. This latter species contains an IFITM3 that is syntenic with human IFITM3 on chromosome 11 and contains a P17L mutation. Phylogenetic analysis of primate IFITM3 showed branching patterns that reproduce major taxonomic groups, with a few exceptions (Figs 4B and EV4A ). While IFITM3 from prosimians clearly represents the basal clade, some IFITM3 sequences found in gorilla, vervet, and orangutan genomes form two outlier branches (in gray). These sequences appear to predate other IFITM3 sequences found in the same species, suggesting that they most likely represent duplication events that took place in simian ancestors. Importantly, the maintenance of these sequences in multiple species until present day may indicate that they retain functional importance (Figs 4B and EV4A ).",

Transfection into 293T cells and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that D22-24 resulted in a shift to the cell surface (Fig 5A) . Predominant plasma membrane staining was also observed for marmoset-specific IFITM3 mutations, reiterating an effect on protein endocytosis through ablation of the AP-2recruiting motif ( Fig 5A) . As expected, primate mutations in the NEDD4-binding motif (P17L found in orangutan and P18H found in vervet) did not grossly affect the subcellular localization of IFITM3. To assess the extent to which each variant could be ubiquitinated in cells, we immunoprecipitated IFITM3 from cells co-expressing NEDD4 or catalytically inactive NEDD4 C867A. In agreement with a previous report [31] , ubiquitinated forms of human full-length IFITM3 can be detected following the overexpression of NEDD4, while the D1-21 variant (which lacks the NEDD4-binding motif) was less ubiquitinated (Fig 5B) . The P17L and P18H mutations also led to lower levels of ubiquitination, especially pools modified with two or three ubiquitin moieties (as indicated by ** and ***, respectively). The IFITM3-specific antibody used here recognized all but the D22-24 variant. We confirmed the presence of ubiquitin using an antibody capable of recognizing mono-and polyubiquitinated proteins (Fig 5B, colored image) . The direct labeling of ubiquitin showed that the D22-24 variant is modified by NEDD4 to an intermediate extent, since it contains an intact NEDD4-binding site yet lacks one nearby lysine residue. Ubiquitination was also detected in the presence of catalytically inactive NEDD4 C867A, albeit at lower levels ( Fig 5B) . These results reveal that the natural P17L, P18H, and D22-24 mutations prevent normal protein ubiquitination not only by ectopic NEDD4, but also by endogenous E3 ligases in 293T cells. Examination of whole-cell lysate fractions confirmed the expression of all IFITM3 variants (Fig 5C) . In accordance with the degree of ubiquitination observed in the immunoprecipitated fractions, certain NEDD4-sensitive variants of IFITM3 were detected at lower levels (relative to the inactive NEDD4 C867A control). Notably, these naturally occurring mutations that disrupt subcellular localization ( Fig 5A) and/or diminish NEDD4-mediated ubiquitination ( Fig 5B) also exhibit enhanced restriction of HIV-1 virion infectivity relative to full-length human IFITM3 (Fig 5D) .",

To measure the functional impact of IFITM3 variation in both of its antiviral roles, we tested the ability of primate IFITM3 variants to inhibit HIV-1 entry when expressed in uninfected target cells. To this end, we achieved the stable expression of IFITM3 variants in 293T cells transduced with CD4 and CXCR4 (293T 4 \u00d7 4 cells) [40] and tested their relative resistance to infection by HIV-1. Importantly, we achieved similar levels of protein expression across all conditions (Fig EV5A) , and the differential subcellular localization displayed between IFITM3 variants was maintained (Fig EV5B) . When these cells were challenged with HIV-1, synthetic and natural IFITM3 variants containing amino-terminus mutations conferred elevated resistance to incoming HIV-1 relative to human IFITM3 (Fig 5E) .

Furthermore, while IFITM3 carrying the P17L and P18H mutations retained the potent restriction of IAV, the D22-24 deletion specific to colobus monkey IFITM3 reduces anti-IAV activity by approximately 20-fold (Fig 5G) . We also tested the antiviral activity of a full-length \"native\" colobus IFITM3 protein, which encodes all amino acid substitutions that differ from human IFITM3 (Appendix Fig S1) , and the results were similar (Fig 5G) . These findings suggest that the functionally informative mutations that govern antiviral potency and specificity are primarily those found among the NEDD4-and AP2-binding motifs. These results demonstrate that select IFITM3 sequences derived from nonhuman primates exhibit elevated activity against HIV-1 when expressed in either donor or target cells, suggesting that naturally occurring mutation has led to IFITM3 variants with enhanced anti-lentiviral potential. However, we show that mutations arising in IFITM3 have opposing effects against HIV-1 and IAV, suggesting a protective trade-off for host antiviral immunity.",

This study identifies the determinants that regulate the potency and specificity with which IFITM3 proteins inhibit HIV-1 infection. We show that post-translational modifications targeting the amino-terminus of IFITM3 impact antiviral activity, and furthermore, the sequence motifs found therein may be subject to natural selection over evolutionary time. Together, these data provide a functional rationale for the recurrent duplication of IFITM genes observed in vertebrate genomes. The duplication and subsequent divergence of IFITM genes may allow them to be conferred with novel cellular or antiviral functions, a process known as neo-functionalization. Following gene duplication, diversification of IFITM3 coding sequence via alternative splicing (in the case of the putative D1-21 form in humans) or by germ line-encoded codon substitution mutations (in the case of nonhuman primates) may allow the cell to expand its antiviral arsenal and to protect different compartments from viral invaders.",

However, our description of natural mutations in primate IFITM3 sequences offers only a first glimpse at the potential variation that exists. It was previously reported that the IFITM3 locus is duplicated or polymorphic in the rhesus macaque and the African Green Monkey [18, 41] . Due to a lack of complete genome sequences, we did not assess IFITM3 variation in additional members of the primate family Cercopithicinae, which comprises most of the monkey species that naturally harbor SIV (and other virus) infections in the wild. Previous reports have demonstrated that these species carry adaptive mutations in restriction factor genes APOBEC3G [42, 43] , SAMHD1 [44] , and TRIM5a [45, 46] , which impact lentivirus infection in vitro and in vivo. Thus, cloning of further IFITM3 genes in diverse species is warranted and may reveal other instances of functional diversification. Future experiments focused on the NEDD4-IFITM3 interaction need to be performed in cells from different tissue types and from different species. For example, while we show that certain primate genomes contain IFITM3 genes in which the NEDD4binding site (PPxY) is altered, experiments were performed in human cells (and thus with human NEDD4). It is unknown whether NEDD4 from different species targets the same structural motif as human NEDD4. The prospect that NEDD4 E3 ligases in different species exhibit different substrate specificities is improbable, however, because the NEDD4 homolog in yeast, Rsp5, also targets substrates bearing the same PPxY signature [47] . A departure from this expectation would be exciting, however, since species-specific NEDD4 activities may be indicative of coevolution between NEDD4 and its cellular substrates in a novel form of genetic conflict [37] . Similar questions regarding the cell-or species-specific function of the endocytic adaptor complex, AP-2, must also be addressed.",

As such, variants of IFITM3 carrying D1-21 or DY20 were deemed \"defective\" or \"nonfunctional\" [20] . On the contrary, we report here that these and other mutations to the amino-terminus of IFITM3 retain and even enhance antiviral function during HIV infection. Furthermore, the use of these hyperactive mutants allowed us to assess the involvement of two distinct, but not mutually exclusive, mechanisms underlying this restriction activity: (i) IFITM3 incorporation into viral membranes and (ii) inhibition of HIV-1 Env maturation and virion incorporation. While our results in 293T cells show that IFITM3 overexpression can lead to slightly decreased gp120 levels in virus-producing cells, as proposed by Yu et al [23] , we do not observe this phenomenon when IFITM3 is induced in T cells. Previously published studies illustrating an effect of IFITM proteins on the synthesis and maturation of many lentiviral proteins [48] , including Gag [17] , and even other cellular proteins [49] , raise the possibility that IFITM proteins, when overexpressed, promote wholesale changes that may affect protein trafficking in general. Furthermore, an HIV-1 Env-specific effect on restriction activity cannot explain the finding that VSV-G pseudotyping of virions produced in the presence of IFITM proteins does not rescue their infectivity [22] . Overall, while changes to Env may be partially responsible for restriction in 293T cells, our results suggest that the situation may be different in lymphocytes.",

Numerous studies have drawn an association between the human SNP rs12252-C in IFITM3 and a severe outcome to IAV infection, yet the protein variant (D1-21) predicted to derive from this SNP has not been directly detected in human cells. Paradoxically, a study has recently reported an association between rs12252-C and rapid progression to AIDS in HIV-infected individuals in China [50] . Since we show here that the D1-21 variant exhibits an elevated anti-HIV-1 activity in both of its antiviral roles when ectopically expressed in human cells, efforts are needed to establish a direct functional link between rs12252-C and the truncated protein variant. Importantly, other polymorphisms exist in human IFITM3, such as one in the promoter that is associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis [51], further experimental advances will be necessary to directly assess the relationship between genotype, IFITM3 protein, and disease susceptibility. There is evidence for recent positive selection in human IFITM3 [20] , so a scenario whereby \"hitchhiking\" (linkage disequilibrium) occurs between neighboring SNPs must also be considered.",

The recurrent appearance of similar mutations in different primate lineages may reflect the presence of a common selective pressure in the past and may even reveal the nature of the selective pressure itself. Our results suggest that certain nonhuman primate IFITM3 may exhibit greater activity against HIV-1, suggesting that evolution may have fine-tuned their function against lentiviruses or other viruses entering and exiting from the cellular plasma membrane. Future studies examining the activities of primate IFITM3 proteins against their autologous SIV strains will be important for confirming their anti-lentiviral potential and may reveal viral countermeasures that allow antagonism or evasion of IFITM proteins. Regardless, this enhancement of function against lentiviruses comes with a loss of activity against other viruses entering at endosomes, like IAV and VSV. Considering that IFITM3 is critical to the antiviral response to IAV in mice and humans [19, 20] , the appearance of mutations in nonhuman IFITM3 that suppress this activity is surprising. Thus, our observation that many primate genomes contain multiple IFITM3 genes may reflect an evolutionary mechanism to provide balanced antiviral protection to the cell. Since some species covered in this study, such as the orangutan, the gorilla, and the common marmoset, have been studied with regard to susceptibility to human virus infections [52,53] it will be of great interest to address how IFITM3 genotype and gene copy number impact in vivo virus replication and transmission.",

HIV-1 incorporating Vpr-B-lactamase (Vpr-Blam) fusion protein was produced via co-transfection of pNL4-3, pVpr-Blam, and pQCXIP encoding IFITM3 variants or an empty control or pCMV-MxA, at a respective plasmid ratio of 3:1.5:1. HIV-1 produced from Tet-ON SupT1 cell lines was produced by first infecting the cells with VSV-G-pseudotyped NL4-3 in the presence of DEAE-dextran (2 lg/ml) followed by overnight doxycycline treatment to induce IFITM3 protein expression.",

Nucleotide and protein sequence alignments were performed using T-Coffee or Clustal Omega and were adjusted manually in CLC Sequence Viewer. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the IFITM gene tree function in Ensembl, and the tree visualized consisted of a final consensus tree constructed using distance and maximum-likelihood methods of nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Further phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Bayesian inference method implemented in the MrBayes program (v3.2.3) [54]. Mutations were introduced into the human IFITM3 sequence by site-directed mutagenesis, while select primate IFITM3 sequences were directly synthesized by Eurofins Genomics and cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pQCXIP.
