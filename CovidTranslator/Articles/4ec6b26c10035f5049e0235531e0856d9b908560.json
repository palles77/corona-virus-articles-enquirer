Numerous age-related changes and comorbidities contribute to increased risk of infections in older adults, but also atypical symptomatology that delays diagnosis. Due to various pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic changes in the older adult, medications are absorbed, metabolized, and eliminated at different rates as compared to younger adults, which increases risk of adverse drug reactions due to use of drug therapy needed for sepsis management. This review provides information to aid in diagnosis as well as offers recommendations for monitoring and treating sepsis in the older adult population.",

            "text": "Older adults are at an increased risk of contracting infectious pathogens due to their declining immune system, in addition to other age-related changes throughout all body systems 1 . Due to these vulnerabilities, older adults are at an increased risk of sepsis 1 . Often, diagnosis and initiation of sepsis bundles are delayed due to the abnormal infectious disease presentations in older adults. In the most recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) 2012 Guidelines, there are recommendations on when to initiate antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressors 2 . However, there are not any recommendations specifically designed for older adults. For the treatment of septic shock syndrome, limited literature exists to guide appropriate selection and dosing of pharmacotherapy in older adults. Many clinical trials of adult patients with severe sepsis and septic shock include a large proportion of older adults, ranging anywhere from 30-45% of the study population, and most enroll patients with an average age of 65 years, suggesting results could be applicable to the older adult population. However, there is a paucity of published data evaluating the effects of vasoactive therapies and overall outcomes specific to patients of advanced age to be able to make practice recommendations. Selection of specific vasopressor and inotropic medications is largely guided by expert opinion, clinician preference for individualization of hemodynamic parameters, and minimization of adverse effects such as tachycardia and new-onset arrhythmias [3] [4] [5] . As the older adult population continues to grow, treating sepsis will become a more costly endeavor as hospital costs currently exceed $60 billion dollars per year 6 . There are many challenges to treating and diagnosing older adults with sepsis, in addition to the inability for older adults to combat against infectious pathogens. The purpose of this expert review is to identify age-related changes which increase the risk of sepsis and cause difficulty with diagnosis and to provide recommendations for treating sepsis in older adults.",

The decreased amounts of na\u00efve B cells are unable to cope and respond to the new antigens.

There is debate on if there is one major cause of the proinflammatory state-whether it is solely due to atherosclerosis, or if there is reactivation of viral illnesses [14] [15] [16] . Older adults have increased concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and C-reactive protein (CRP) 17 . These inflammatory factors circulate through the bloodstream and may then blunt and delay the overall immune response through downregulation of receptors 18 . A new term, inflammaging, has been introduced to describe this chronic, low-grade, inflammation that occurs in older adults. In addition to CRP and IL-6, older adults also have increased levels of other interleukins, especially interleukin-10 (IL-10). In severe sepsis, older adults have exhibited a larger ratio of IL-10 compared to TNF, which has been associated with increased mortality 1,20 .",

The most common comorbidities that have been linked to an increase risk of infection are congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver failure, chronic obstructive lung disease, malignancies, and chronic infections 28 . Chronic diabetes mellitus not only increases infection risk due to formation of neuropathy and poor vasculature from longstanding history of the disease, but it also leads to delayed phagocytosis corresponding with decreased clearance of yeast and bacteria by the neutrophils 29 . Chronic kidney disease is also thought to cause similar impairments on the immune system as diabetes mellitus 30 . Iron overload inhibits cellular immune effector function, which is commonly seen in chronic kidney disease due to potential over supplementation of iron for treatment of anemia of chronic disease 31 . Chronic liver failure causes impairment of complement factor formation and proliferation of cellular immunity 7 .",

The main use of vasopressors, in addition to IV fluids, is to achieve a MAP \u2265 65 mm Hg, but there are many controversies on addition of vasopressors, including the type of vasopressor to achieve MAP goals. Questions remain about targeting a higher MAP goal (80-85 mm Hg) may be beneficial in older adults due to additional comorbidities, but clinical trials nor the SSC support this goal elevation. Although many clinical trials include the older adult population, there are not subgroup analyses or specific recommendations for clinicians to extrapolate to older adults for fluid resuscitation at this time.",

Several factors should be taken into consideration when selecting agents, including suspected site of infection, co-morbidities, antibiotic exposure in the past 30 days, and nursing home residence. If available, a patient's prior culture results and facility-specific antibacterial surveillance data can also be helpful. Older adults are approximately 1.3 times more likely to have gram-negative pathogens when compared to younger age groups 23, 54 . Multi-drug resistant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, and extended-spectrum Beta lactamase-producing organisms are also more likely to be identified in residents of long-term care facilities 34 . Based on the site of infection in older adults, there are slight differences in pathogens that require broad spectrum antibiotics (Table 2) . Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started initially and then de-escalated as appropriate 2 . Antibiotics should always be started at full initial doses and then adjusted based on renal function 2 .",

If the older adult is exhibiting life-threatening hypotension, the addition of vasoactive agents is recommended to achieve of MAP \u2265 65 mm Hg to maintain perfusion. There are studies that suggest targeting higher MAP (80-85 mm Hg) for patients with atherosclerosis and hypertension; however, none of these studies demonstrated change in overall mortality.
