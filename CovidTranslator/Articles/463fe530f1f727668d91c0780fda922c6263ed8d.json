            "text": "a gradual increase in on-farm mortality of Dutch veal calves was observed. In 2012, the cattle industry decided that more information was needed on risk factors for mortality in both veal herds and herds of origin to enable implementation of risk mitigating measures. Routinely collected data were available from seven different data sources and contained information from 2.4 million white veal calves that were fattened in the period between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2014. Survival analysis techniques (Kaplan-Meier), multilevel Poisson and multilevel Logistic regression models were applied to analyse the data. Two different models were assembled in which risk factors for veal calf mortality in respectively veal herds and herds of origin were identified. Univariable and multivariable regression techniques were used to detect risk factors significantly associated with mortality of veal calves during the fattening period. During the study period, the mean mortality was 4.9% per production cycle. The probability to die was highest during the first weeks after arrival in the veal herds and declined thereafter. Important risk factors included a veal herds with a higher use of antimicrobials, hair colour as proxy for breed, certain countries of origin, veal herd management with a limited amount of supplied feed and a not having an all-in / all-out system. A higher body weight at arrival in the veal herd was associated with lower mortality as well as veal calves that were fed an above median amount of milk, roughage and concentrates. From the calves that were fattened during the study period, observations of 1.1 million calves originated from the Netherlands and were available to study risk factors for veal calf mortality associated with the herd of origin. Important risk factors included purchase, herds with high mortality rates in the quarter in which the calf was born, fast growth in herd size, high cattle replacement rates and a higher antibiotic use in the quarter of birth. Calves that originated from herds that were certified BVD-free, Salmonella-unsuspected or Paratuberculosis-unsuspected, had a lower odds to die during the subsequent fattening period in a veal herd. Veal calf mortality was influenced by risk factors at the herd of origin as well as at veal herds. Adequate collaboration between the different industries is necessary to optimize veal calf management leading to a reduction in veal calf mortality during the fattening period. (I.M.G.A.

            "text": "Annually, 5.8 million veal calves are fattened in Europe (Sans and De Fontguyon, 2009 ). With 1.6 million fattened veal calves per year, the Netherlands has one of the largest veal industries in Europe (Brscic et al., 2011; Sans and De Fontguyon, 2009) . In this industry, surplus calves mostly born in dairy herds throughout Europe, are collected, fattened and eventually slaughtered. Given the fact that veal calves account for more than one-third of the total cattle population in the Netherlands, it is important to monitor their health. On population level, cattle health is monitored on a quarterly basis through the national cattle health surveillance system (CHSS) (Santman- Berends et al., 2016) . One of the key-monitoring indicators in this system is mortality rate. Between 2009 and the end of 2012 a gradual increase in mortality rate of veal calves was observed in the CHSS. In the corresponding period, the policy with regard to antimicrobial use was altered, resulting in reduced possibilities to apply antibiotics in livestock followed by a tremendous decrease (> 50%) in antimicrobial usage (SDa, 2014) . It was hypothesized that this decrease in antibiotic use was associated with the increased mortality rate. Nevertheless, other potential causes were identified such as increased imports of calves persistently infected with BVDV, increased herd sizes and factors related to the herd from which the calves originated. Yet, even with all these potential conditions that might have led to an increased mortality in veal herds, the large between herd variation in veal calf mortality provided potential for improvement in herds with high mortality rates.",

            "text": "To enable the implementation of risk mitigating measures for veal calf mortality, more information was needed on risk factors associated with veal calf mortality. Although it is well known that diarrhoea and respiratory infections are the main causes of mortality among veal calves (Pardon et al., 2012; Hoet et al., 2003; Webster, 1990) , the risk factors associated with occurrence of these disorders are ambiguous. Various studies describe pathogens as the cause of these problems such as Rotavirus, Coronavirus, BVDV and Cryptosporidium (Hoet et al., 2003; Bendali et al., 1999) , but lack to describe management factors on which the farmer can intervene. There have been studies that described factors associated to either diarrhoea, respiratory syndromes or both. These factors include colostrum intake (Lorenz, 2006; Perez et al., 1990) , BVDV (Pardon et al., 2013 and Pardon et al., 2012) , weight at arrival in the veal herd (Brscic et al., 2012) , housing (Brscic et al., 2012; Lorenz, 2006) and type and amount of feed (Brscic et al., 2012) . Nevertheless, it is unknown to which extent these risk factors for diarrhoea and respiratory syndromes are associated to veal calf mortality and whether these results are applicable to the white veal industry in the Netherlands. Additionally, this information does not provide insight in the combination of factors related to both the veal herd and the herd of origin that are associated to mortality. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate risk factors in veal herds and in the herd in which the calves were born that are associated with mortality of veal calves.",

An attempt was made to apply survival analysis techniques on the data. Survival time was defined as the time between entry in the veal herd and either death or the end of the follow up period i.e. the date of slaughter. White veal calves are slaughtered between 180 and 200 days of age thus the maximum study duration was set at 200 days. Observations of calves that outlived this period, were censored at 200 days. The Kaplan-Meier survival function in Stata (Stel et al., 2011; Kaplan and Meier, 1958) was used to determine the daily hazard rate, conditional on having survived until that specific day. Parameters such as mortality rates, probability of survival and the cumulative probability of dying were presented using life tables. Univariable associations between mortality rate and potential confounders were described using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Cox proportional hazard frailty models were evaluated to test the association between potential risk factors and the time to survive, correcting for the hierarchical structure of the data. The attempt to correct for within herd clustering combined with the large number of observations lead to non-converging models and thus survival analyses seemed unfeasible for multivariable analysis of our data. Therefore multivariable regression techniques were applied for analysis of the data and it was decided to build two different models. The first model evaluated risk factors for veal calf mortality in veal herds and was conducted at the level of production cycle. The second model assessed risk factors for veal calf mortality associated with the herd of origin and was conducted on animal level. The latter was exclusively conducted on observations from veal calves originating from the Netherlands because information about the herd of origin was only available for Dutch calves.",

Significance of relevant two-and three-way interaction terms and the amount of variance that was explained by the final multivariable model were assessed. Additionally, confounding was checked by evaluating the change in model coefficients after introduction of possible confounders (e.g. age at arrival as possible confounder for body weight at arrival).

One of the most important factors in our model was the body weight of calves at arrival, with a higher starting weight being associated with a lower mortality. We checked whether the association between mortality and body weight would change when we corrected for age at arrival as confounder, but no change in association was observed. Our results were in agreement with the results of Brscic et al. (2012) , who found that a lower weight at arrival was associated with an increased risk to develop respiratory infections, which is an important cause for mortality. Additionally, both Winder et al. (2016) and Brickell et al. (2009) found that a lower body weight at arrival in the veal herds was associated with an increased risk to die in the first six months. Veal calves of the Belgian Blue breed had a lower mortality risk than other breeds of calves in our study. Even though, these calves might have a higher body weight at arrival, the lower mortality risk was also observed when we Table 4 Results of the multivariable multilevel logistic regression model of the association between veal calf mortality during the fattening period and risk factors associated with the herd of origin based on 852,462 Dutch veal calves that were fattened in the period between January 2011 and July 2014. corrected for weight at arrival as confounding factor. It was hypothesised that the lower mortality rate was due to the fact that Belgian Blue calves are very valuable resulting in application of additional care to maximise the probability of survival. This hypothesis was further supported by the fact that the veal cooperations stated that they only select specific farmers for fattening Belgian Blue calves. Another known risk factor that was found in our study was purchase of cattle. Both in the herd of origin as in the subsequent veal herd (herds without an all-in/all-out system), purchase was a risk factor for a higher mortality rate. This finding was in accordance with previous studies of Pardon et al. (2012) and Gorden and Plummer (2010) , who found that purchase resulted in a higher risk for respiratory infections during the fattening period, which consequentially may result in a higher mortality risk. The Kaplan-Meijer survival curve showed that the detrimental effect of purchase i.e. not having an all-in/all-out system, occurred from day 40 after arrival in the veal herd and onwards (results not presented). Generally, after this moment a new production round of calves enter the veal farm without all-in/all-out system resulting in an increased risk of introduction of infections and increasing the mortality risk. The significant association between veal calf mortality and number of calves in the specific production cycle that was found in this study was incoherent as both the smallest and largest veal herds were protective factors, whereas the size groups in between had a higher risk. Moreover, the association between veal calf mortality and the information from the critical control points was ambiguous. The answers could either be yes the farm complies with the demand, no the farm does not comply or not applicable. For most points, the answer \"no\" did not occur and the answer \"not applicable\" was significantly associated with the mortality rate. Nevertheless, information about the rationale behind this answer was not provided and might differ between farms.",

Both results indicate that health problems, either during the first weeks after birth or during the subsequent fattening period are associated with a higher probability to die during the fattening period. This finding is supported by earlier research of Jarrige et al. (2017) and B\u00e4hler et al. (2012) , who both found that antibiotic treatment was associated with higher mortality. In the Netherlands, prophylactic use of antibiotics is forbidden and a higher use of antibiotics is thus an indication for increased health problems that result in a higher mortality rate. Moreover, a higher use of antibiotics might result in antibiotic resistance in time, which can deteriorate the possibility to treat infections and thus increase mortality (Hoet et al., 2003; Bos et al., 2012) . Furthermore, we also observed that calves originating from herds with a higher health status for endemic diseases (i.e. BVDV, Salmonella, Paratbc), had a lower probability to die during their subsequent fattening period.",

Previous study already stressed the importance to provide sufficient amount of feed, especially when diarrhoea problems occur (Lorenz, 2006) . In our study we were only able to distinguish concentrates and roughage and were unable to specify the feed on a more detailed level. Based on previous studies, not only the amount of feed but also the specific feed that is administered is indicated to be associated to health problems and mortality (Webb et al., 2013; Berends et al., 2012; Brscic et al., 2011) .

We evaluated the possibilities to include such information, but at the time of the study, data of the transporter was not yet centrally registered.
