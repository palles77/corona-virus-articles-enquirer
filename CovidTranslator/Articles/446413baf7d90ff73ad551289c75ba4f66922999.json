            "text": "Sequences in the 5 untranslated region (5UTR) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is important for modulating both translation and RNA replication. The translation of the HCV genome depends on an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located within the 341-nucleotide 5UTR, while RNA replication requires a smaller region. A question arises whether the replication and translation functions require different regions of the 5UTR and different sets of RNA-binding proteins. Here, we showed that the 5-most 157 nucleotides of HCV RNA is the minimum 5UTR for RNA replication, and it partially overlaps with the IRES. Stem-loops 1 and 2 of the 5UTR are essential for RNA replication, whereas stem-loop 1 is not required for translation. We also found that poly(C)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) bound to the replication region of the 5UTR and associated with detergent-resistant membrane fractions, which are the sites of the HCV replication complex. The knockdown of PCBP2 by short hairpin RNA decreased the amounts of HCV RNA and nonstructural proteins. Antibody-mediated blocking of PCBP2 reduced HCV RNA replication in vitro, indicating that PCBP2 is directly involved in HCV RNA replication. Furthermore, PCBP2 knockdown reduced IRES-dependent translation preferentially from a dual reporter plasmid, suggesting that PCBP2 also regulated IRES activity. These findings indicate that PCBP2 participates in both HCV RNA replication and translation. Moreover, PCBP2 interacts with HCV 5-and 3UTR RNA fragments to form an RNA-protein complex and induces the circularization of HCV RNA, as revealed by electron microscopy. This study thus demonstrates the mechanism of the participation of PCBP2 in HCV translation and replication and provides physical evidence for HCV RNA circularization through 5-and 3UTR interaction.",

HCV starts to assemble its viral particles around lipid droplets and exits the cell through the secretory pathway (34) . Since the same positive-strand RNA can participate in different steps of the viral life cycle, the regulation between these processes is very important and may be mediated by various host factors interacting with the viral RNA or viral proteins. Signals required for the replication and translation of positive-strand RNA viruses usually are located in the 5\u0408-and 3\u0408-terminal regions of the viral RNA. The sequences required for RNA replication and translation often overlap, and the regulatory mechanism can be separated or shared.",

Some of the host factors directly regulate HCV RNA replication either by participating in the formation of the RNA replication complex (e.g., VAP-33) (19) or by binding to the viral RNA (e.g., PTB and La). Many host proteins interacting with the HCV 5\u0408UTR have dual functions. La autoantigen, PTB, and SYNCRIP were found not only to regulate RNA translation but also to modulate its replication (7, 11, 35) . Questions arise about whether the regulatory sequences for protein synthesis and RNA replication overlap or are separable and whether the regulation of HCV replication and translation is coupled.",

PCBP2 (also named hnRNP E2 or \u2423CP-2), a host protein known to bind to the 5\u0408UTR of the poliovirus genome, regulates the switch between poliovirus translation and replication (43) . PCPB2 is a member of the cellular heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, which is expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. hnRNPs are well known for their abilities to bind to cellular proteins and RNAs to facilitate many biological processes, such as mRNA stabilization, transcriptional regulation, translational control, and apoptotic program activation (37, 40) . PCBP2 contains three highly conserved hnRNP K homology (KH) domains, the first and third of which mediate ribohomopoly(C) [poly(rC)] binding, and the second domain may enhance binding affinity and/or specificity (10, 12) . The protein also has been shown to form homodimers (18) and to interact with other hnRNPs (30) . PCBP2 also binds to the HCV 5\u0408UTR (16, 51) , but whether it binds to the IRES region or the replication region is still unclear. The role of PCBP2 in regulating HCV translation has been investigated but remains inconclusive (14, 16) . Also, its role in HCV RNA replication is not clear. It is possible that PCBP2, similarly to PTB and La, regulates both the translation and replication of HCV RNA.",

The screening of the cellular proteins binding to the HCV 5\u0408UTR identified PCBP2 as a protein binding to the replication region of the 5\u0408UTR. Further investigation showed that PCBP2 plays roles in both HCV RNA replication and translation. We showed that PCBP2 was able to bind both the 5\u0408-and 3\u0408UTR to form an RNA-protein complex. Moreover, electron microscopy (EM) showed that PCBP2 induced changes of RNA conformation from linear to circular, suggesting that PCBP2 is involved in the circularization of the HCV genome. This circularization may be important for HCV RNA replication and is common among RNA viruses.",

To ensure that the mutations in the 5\u0408UTR did not affect the translation driven by EV71 and EMCV IRES, the mutant RNAs were in vitro translated by a coupled transcription/translation system (Promega), and the protein products (NS5A) were detected by immunoblotting.

To maintain the stem of SL1 with different sequences, the nucleotides of the stem were switched by compensatory mutations (157-sp-EVI/SL1switch) or by replacing C-G base pairs with U-A base pairs (157-sp-EVI/SL1-UA) (Fig. 2E) . The disruption of the SL1 stem by nucleotide substitutions inhibited colony formation (SL1-AG). The maintenance of the stem structure by compensatory mutations with different nucleotides (SL1 switch) or by the replacement of the C/G base-paired stem with A/U base pairs (SL1-UA) allowed HCV RNA replication to occur at decreased efficiency. The results indicated that the maintenance of the 5\u0408UTR SL1 structure was sufficient for HCV RNA replication, but the sequence of the stem still is important for efficient replication (Fig. 2F) .",

To understand the mechanism of the regulation of RNA replication by the 5\u0408UTR sequence, we searched for the cellular proteins binding to this region. We first performed RNA-protein binding experiments using Huh7 cellular lysates and the biotin-labeled 157-nt replication region of HCV 5\u0408UTR RNA. RNA-binding proteins were pulled down together with biotin-labeled RNA by streptavidin beads (Fig. 3A) . The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by MALDI-mass spectrometry (Table 1) . Among the proteins identified, PCBP2 had been shown to be involved in HCV RNA translation (14) , but its effects on RNA replication have not been studied. Since PCBP2 also regulates poliovirus RNA replication, we focused on this protein. We first confirmed the binding of PCBP2 to the HCV 5\u0408UTR by immunoblotting; the results indicated that PCBP2 bound to the HCV 5\u0408UTR replication region, especially to the stem-loop 1 RNA fragment (Fig. 3B) . It did not bind to SL2. PCBP2 was unable to bind to the replication region RNA without SL1, but it bound to the same RNA fragment without SL2. Therefore, SL1 of the HCV 5\u0408UTR is important for PCBP2 binding. (Fig. 3B) .",

To determine the biological role of PCBP2 in HCV RNA replication, we monitored the effects of PCBP2 knockdown on HCV RNA replication and translation. Several shRNAs targeting different regions of PCBP2 were used. The replicon cells expressing PCBP2 shRNA clones A and B showed a substantial reduction of the endogenous PCBP2, while clones C and D did not have significant effects. Correspondingly, the protein expression levels of HCV NS3 and NS5A also were decreased in replicon cells expressing clones A and B but not C and D (Fig. 4A ). In the time course assay of the RNA expression level, the knockdown of PCBP2 in HCV replicon cells resulted in a rapid reduction of PCBP2 RNA and HCV RNA with almost the same kinetics (Fig. 4B) . In HCV-infected Huh7.5 cells, the expression of shPCBP2 clones A and B also resulted in a reduction in the amounts of PCBP2 and a corresponding decrease of HCV NS3 and NS5A proteins (Fig. 4C ) as well as of HCV RNA (Fig. 4D) .

(B) PCBP2 bound to the fragments containing nt 1 to 157 of the HCV 5\u0408UTR, SL1, and the 157-nt fragment deleting SL2, but it did not bind to SL2 or the 157-nt fragment deleting SL1.

Some PCBP2 is located in detergent-resistant membrane fraction and interacts with HCV nonstructural proteins in HCV replicon cells. HCV RNA replication occurs in the detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fraction (5, 13, 49) , suggesting that the viral replication complex is associated with the lipid raft (2, 19) . Since the nonstructural proteins and RNA of HCV are associated with the DRM structure, we examined whether PCBP2 also was associated with the DRM structure. The membrane flotation analysis showed that the majority of PCBP2 was located in the cytosolic fractions (fractions 5 to 9) (Fig. 5A) in both Huh7 and HCV replicon Rep1.1 cells; however, a small fraction of it was associated with the membrane fractions of the replicon cells but not of Huh7 cells (fractions 2 to 4) (Fig. 5A) . These membrane-bound PCBP2 proteins could not be removed by Triton X-100 treatment at 4\u00b0C. HCV NS5A also was located in the DRM fraction of the replicon cells (fractions 2 and 3) (Fig. 5A) . As a control, calnexin, a marker protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, was detected exclusively in the detergent-soluble membrane fraction (fractions 2 and 3) in both Huh7 and replicon cells (Fig. 5A) , which is characteristic of unmodified ER. The data suggested that some PCBP2 proteins are located together with NS5A in the DRM fraction in the replicon cells but not in the cells without the HCV replicon, indicating that PCBP2 is specifically recruited to the HCV replication complex.",

This effect may be due to the direct inhibition of RNA replication or indirectly results from the inhibition of translation, i.e., the viral NS protein synthesis was decreased, causing the inhibition of viral RNA synthesis. To determine whether PCBP2 directly affects HCV RNA replication, we performed an in vitro replication assay using crude membrane fractions of the HCV replicon cells and assessed the effect of the antibody-mediated blocking of proteins (5, 19) . The replicon cell lysates were incubated with different amounts of mouse anti-PCBP2 monoclonal antibody to block the endogenous PCBP2. After incubation, samples were used for the cell-free synthesis of viral RNA. The results showed that the blocking of PCBP2 repressed the RNA replication activity in an antibody concentration-dependent manner. As a control, antibody against VAP-33, which is a critical factor in HCV RNA replication (22) , also inhibited HCV RNA replication. The anti-calnexin antibody did not block HCV RNA replication (Fig. 6) . The result suggested that PCBP2 is directly involved in HCV RNA replication.",

The results showed that, in the presence of shPCBP2, the IRES activity was significantly lower than that of cap-dependent translation, indicating that PCBP2 is involved in IRES-mediated translation (Fig. 7B) .",

Previous data showed that PCBP2 binds to both the 5\u0408-and 3\u0408UTR of HCV RNA (Fig. 3) ; furthermore, PCBP2 oligomerizes by interacting with itself (16) , suggesting that PCBP2 is involved in mediating interactions between both ends of the viral genome. To test this notion, we applied streptavidin beads loaded with the biotinylated HCV 5\u0408UTR to test for its possible interaction/coprecipitation with a 32 P-labeled 3\u0408UTR in the presence or absence of PCBP2 (Fig. 8A ). We observed a significant level of 5\u0408 to 3\u0408 RNA interaction in the presence of PCBP2. In contrast, unrelated protein BSA did not cause coprecipitation between both ends of HCV RNA. Increasing amounts of the unlabeled 5\u0408-or 3\u0408UTR RNA competed away the binding between the 5\u0408-and 3\u0408UTR, suggesting that PCBP2 linkage to both ends of HCV RNA is a specific interaction (Fig. 8B) . Furthermore, SL1 alone, but not SL2, of the 5\u0408UTR could mediate the interaction through PCBP2 linkage (Fig. 8C ). Hence, these data supported the conclusion that PCBP2 promotes specific interactions between the HCV 5\u0408-and 3\u0408UTR. PCPB2 induces HCV RNA circularization. The PCBP2-mediated interaction between the HCV 5\u0408UTR and 3\u0408UTR suggests that PCBP2 forms a protein bridge to induce HCV RNA circularization. To substantiate this concept, we observed protein-mediated changes of the HCV RNA conformation by electron microscopy (EM). To avoid the secondary structures of single-stranded RNAs, we designed RNA molecules that consisted of the single-stranded HCV 5\u0408-and 3\u0408UTRs flanking \u03f32,000-bp double-stranded RNA of HCV internal sequences (see Materials and Methods) (Fig. 9A ). After interacting with PCBP2 or unrelated protein BSA, the RNA molecules were observed by EM. In the presence of BSA, the RNA molecules appeared in linear conformation. In the presence of PCBP2, a large portion of RNA was circular. Significantly, there appeared to be a protein dot in the middle of the circular RNA. The RNAs deleting one or both ends of HCV UTRs failed to undergo circularization, even though one end of the RNA molecules appeared to be coated with proteins (Fig. 9B) . These data indicated that PCBP2 interacts with both ends of the viral UTRs and induces the circularization of HCV RNA molecules.",

            "text": "Positive-strand RNA viruses, such as HCV, poliovirus, and coronavirus, amplify their genomes to thousands of copies in only a few hours; thus, efficiency and speed are important characteristics of the viral replication machinery. The genomic RNA initially directs the synthesis of viral proteins. Once the viral proteins are synthesized, the viral RNA is copied, starting from the 3\u0408 end, to generate a complementary negativestranded RNA that, in turn, is transcribed into a nascent positive-strand genomic RNA. Thus, the genomic RNA must be recognized by both the translation machinery and the viral replication apparatus, and the regulation between these processes is very important and may be affected by various host factors interacting with the viral RNA or viral proteins. Recent evidence indicates that, besides the virus-encoded factors, host cell proteins play an essential role in the replication of positivestrand RNA viruses. Signals required for the replication and translation of positive-strand RNA viruses usually are located in the 5\u0408-and 3\u0408-terminal regions of the viral RNA. The sequences required for RNA replication and translation often overlap, and the regulatory mechanisms can be separated or shared. In this study, we used a replicon system which allows the high-level self replication of HCV RNA in Huh7 cells to identify the regulatory sequences (36) . In this transient replication system, we chose the IRES of EV71 to drive neo gene expression for several reasons: (i) the translational activity of EV71 IRES is higher (33) , and (ii) both in structure and in functional terms, the HCV IRES is different from the EV71 IRES, and therefore it should not contain sequences or structures that could compensate for deleted sequences of the HCV 5\u0408UTR. The HCV 5\u0408UTR is well known to mediate IRES-dependent translation (50) . Previous data showed that the HCV 5\u0408UTR also participates in RNA replication, but the functional region and how it regulates both mechanisms remained unclear (15) . In this study, we showed that the 5\u0408-terminal 157 nucleotides, including stem-loops 1 and 2, of the HCV genome are necessary for RNA replication. Stem-loop 2 of this replication region is also a part of the IRES-mediated translation region, indicating that this region participates in both replication and translation. Whether the stem-loop 2 sequence of the HCV 5\u0408UTR mediates the switching between these two functions remains unclear.",

We have identified several potential factors that bind to the replication region of the HCV 5\u0408UTR, one of which is PCBP2. PCBP2 previously was known to interact with the 5\u0408UTR of the HCV genome, but its binding site and biological function have not been clarified (16) . Some research indicates that the role of PCBP2 in HCV is to mediate IRES-dependent translation (14, 41) , yet it is unclear how PCBP2 does so. Some researchers report that PCBP2-depleted rabbit reticulocyte lysate still supports translation from HCV IRES-dependent mRNA (16) . Other researchers conclude that ribohomopoly(C) competitor RNA, via PCBP sequestration, inhibits the translation of poliovirus mRNAs without affecting the translation of an HCV IRES-dependent mRNA (39) , and HCV IRES-dependent translation in yeast is not dependent on PCBP2 (46) . Also, a study showed that the HCV RNA level was reduced by PCBP2 short interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown (44) . Thus, the precise role of PCBP2 in HCV translation was not clear. Our studies here showed that PCBP2 regulates both the replication and translation of HCV RNA. Current results show that several other cellular proteins, including PTB (26), Lsm1-7 (48) , and IGF2BP1 (54) , also bind to the HCV 5\u0408UTR and regulate IRES-dependent translation. Whether PCBP2 directly regulates translation or indirectly functions as a complex with other cellular factors needs further investigation.",

The presence of ribosomes on viral RNA prevents the viral RNA polymerase from initiating negative-strand RNA elongation. After PCBP2 is cleaved by the accumulated viral proteinase 3CD, the binding of ribosomes to the IRES is inhibited. The translation process is stopped, but the cleaved form of PCBP2 still can facilitate the interaction of the 5\u0408 RNP complex with the 3\u0408 poly(A) tract via a bridging interaction with poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). Therefore, the translating ribosomes on the RNA template are cleared, and the latter interaction would lead to the initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis (43) .

The localization of PCBP2 to the DRM fractions in HCV replicon cells indicates that PCBP2 is associated with the RNA replication complex. Furthermore, the finding that antibody-mediated blocking of PCBP2 led to the inhibition of HCV RNA replication in vitro strongly suggests that PCBP2 is directly involved in HCV RNA replication. It is possible that PCBP2 recruits other factors to facilitate the assembly of the replication complex. It is particularly interesting that it interacts with NS5A, an essential protein in HCV RNA replication. Our studies also found that PCBP2 affects the HCV IRESdependent translation activity in the shRNA knockdown experiment. Thus, we established that PCBP2 is a dual-function protein, being involved in both RNA replication and translation of HCV. So far, several host proteins, including La autoantigen, polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein (PTB) (1, 7, 11) , and SYNCRIP (9, 35) , have been identified to bind to the HCV 5\u0408UTR and regulate both translation and replication. PTB binds to three separate sites on the HCV 5\u0408UTR, two of which are located at the region of IRES (3, 26) . The dual functions of the host RNA-binding proteins may be a common characteristic in viral life cycles. We found that PCBP2 binds predominantly to SL1, which is required exclusively for RNA replication, but not SL2, a region involved in both replication and translation. Perhaps its role in HCV replication and translation is through the interaction between the 5\u0408 and 3\u0408UTR, since it also binds to the 3\u0408UTR of HCV RNA.",

            "text": "Genome circularization may be a common feature of positive-strand RNA viruses, but the specific details of circularization vary from virus family to family, such as RNA-RNA interaction for flaviviruses (21) , RNA-protein-protein-RNA interaction for picornaviruses (23) , and cRNA-RNA sequences for dengue virus (57) . Genome circularization may provide several advantages for viral replication, including the coordination of translation and RNA synthesis, the localiza-tion of the viral polymerase at the appropriate start site (allowing the viral and cellular proteins to interact with the terminal ends of the viral genome and, in turn, initiating translation or replication efficiently), and a control mechanism for the integrity of the viral genome. In our study, PCBP2 was found to bind to both the 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 ends of the HCV genome and also formed an RNA-protein complex. Furthermore, it recruits both ends of the genome to change the RNA conformation from linear to circular. Such RNA circularization explains how 3\u0408UTR sequences can regulate translation (25) and possibly also RNA replication. Several other proteins, including PTB, NF/NFAR proteins, LSm1-7, and IGF2BP1, also were found to bind to both ends of the HCV genome and be involved in replication and/or translation (25, 26, 48, 54) , suggesting that there is a set of protein complexes which are recruited to the ends of the HCV genome, forming a bridge between 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 ends to regulate and switch the machineries of translation and replication in turn. Our study here provided physical evidence for the possibility of such RNA circularization.",
