With this soluble S protein fragment as an affinity ligand, we screened HeLa cells transduced with retroviral cDNA library from Vero E6 cells and obtained a HeLa cell clone which could bind with the S protein. This cell clone was susceptible to HIV/SARS pseudovirus infection and the presence of a functional receptor for S protein in this cell clone was confirmed by the cell-cell fusion assay. Further studies showed the susceptibility of this cell was due to the expression of endogenous angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which was activated by inserted LTR from retroviral vector used for expression cloning. When human ACE2 cDNA was transduced into NIH3T3 cells, the ACE2 expressing NIH3T3 cells could be infected with HIV/SARS pseudovirus. These data clearly demonstrated that ACE2 was the functional receptor for SARS-CoV.",

Using the method to isolate viral receptors, the cDNA library from susceptible cells was delivered into non-infectable cells and the receptor function gaining cells was then selected-either by challenging with a pseudovirus carrying a selection marker [1, 2] or by FACS sorting with the virus' envelope protein containing the receptor binding domain as an affinity ligand [3] . The causative agent of SARS was identified to be a novel coronavirus [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Because the spike (S) glycoprotein of coronavirus was responsible for the binding to the specific receptor [9] [10] [11] [12] , we designed an expression cloning strategy to isolate the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV. Here we reported the expression cloning of ACE2 as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV. Our cloning strategy also suggested a novel approach for functional gene cloning through insertion activation of the endogenous genes.",

These fragments would be secreted into the culture medium because of the signal peptide ligated to their N terminal, and their existence in conditioned medium was tested by ELISA. The binding of these proteins to Vero E6 cells was analyzed by FACS using sera from SARS patients or anti-6\u00b7 His mAb. We found that both S640 and S500 were able to bind with Vero E6 cells while S440 was unable to do so (Fig. 1A) . Further study with S500 showed that it did not bind to non-infectable cells such as HeLa cells (Fig. 1B) . Moreover, this S500 binding could be blocked if S500 was pre-incubated with neutralizing sera from convalescent SARS patients (Fig. 1C) . These studies indicate that S500 could specifically interact with a putative receptor expressed on the surface of Vero E6 cells. Similar results were recently reported that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein located in the N-terminal 318-510 residuals [15, 16] . Our results further indicated that 503-510 residuals were unnecessary for binding with the receptor.",

            "text": "Two strategies were used to recover the cDNA sequence encoding the receptor protein for HIV/SARS pseudovirus in the F5 cells. Recombinant retroviruses could ectopically express the encoded cDNA library proteins to confer the infectivity of the HIV/SARS pseudovirus. Alternatively, the retroviral vector used for cloning cDNA libraries had two long terminal repeat sequences (LTRs) on both sides of the cDNA insert. The LTRs could function as a promoter to initiate the transcription of their downstream sequences [17] . Integration of recombinant retroviruses containing two LTR promoter sequences into the upstream region of an endogenous gene might thus transcriptionally activate the expression of the downstream endogenous gene by the second LTR promoter element in the virus. We analyzed both possibilities by extracting the genomic DNAs from F5 cells. The virus-encoded cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers flanking inserts in the retroviral vectors. A 1.3 k PCR product was cloned. DNA sequencing revealed the cDNA encoded triosephosphate isomerase (TPI). Analysis of the expression of TPI in non-permissive and permissive cells to infection suggested that there was no correlation between the susceptibility of the HIV/SARS pseudovirus and TPI expression in various cells (data not shown). Therefore, we tested the possibility that the LTR-TPI-LTR fragment might accidentally integrate into the upstream region of the endogenous receptor gene for S protein so that the second LTR activated the transcription of the endogenous receptor gene in the F5 cells. The expression of this receptor protein conferred the infectivity of F5 cells to HIV/SARS pseudovirus. To identify the genome DNA sequences downstream of the retroviral LTR element, we used the thermal asymmetric interlaced (TAIL) PCR, a method for recovery of DNA fragment adjacent to known sequences [14, 18] . After three rounds of TAIL-PCR, a 300 basepair (bp) band and a 900 bp band were detected (Fig. 3A) . The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. Sequence alignment indicated that one of them was part of the retrovirus vector sequence and the other was the 5 0 region of the human ACE2 gene. The retrovirus integrated into the 5 0 end of the endogenous ACE2 gene so that there was only 169 bp from the end of retroviral LTR to the start codon (ATG) of endogenous ACE2. The integration of the retroviral LTR into the upstream region of the endogenous ACE2 gene was further confirmed by genomic DNA PCR using primers specific to LTR and ACE2 (Figs. 3B and D) .",

These results clearly demonstrated that ACE2 was the functional receptor for SARS-CoV. When we were preparing this manuscript, Li et al.
