Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes lethal diarrhea in piglets, resulting in great economic losses all over the world. To detect and isolate PEDV rapidly and accurately is important for the control and further research of the clinical PEDV strains. In this study, four sdAb fragments (sdAb-Mc19/29/30/37) targeting the membrane (M) protein of PEDV were selected from sdAb library that was constructed through M protein-immunized Camelus bactrianus. The selected sdAb-Mcs were solubly expressed in Escherichia coli. The functional characteristics analysis revealed that the recombinant sdAb-Mcs have excellent binding activity and specificity to M protein but have no neutralizing activity to PEDV. For further application, sdAb-Mc37 was conjugated with quantum dots to synthesize a nanoprobe for imaging PEDV in vero cells. The observed fluorescence in vero cells clearly reflects that PEDV virions can be reliably recognized and labeled by the nanoprobe. Furthermore, the sdAb-Mc29 was conjugated with superparamagnetic nanobeads to construct immunomagnetic nanobeads (IMNBs) used to isolate PEDV. One PEDV strain was successfully isolated from clinical fecal sample, suggesting IMNBs as a novel and efficient tool suitable for PEDV isolation from clinical samples. This study provided a novel application and substantiated the suitability of sdAb as a specific binder for the isolation of viruses.",

HcAb devoids of light chains naturally, but keeps the function of conventional antibodies depend on three complementarity determining regions in variable domain. The sdAb displays very significant characteristics including a small molecular weight of 15 kDa, ease of expression in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and purification, high expression yields, high solubility and thermostability, and stability at extreme pH conditions that are superior to conventional antibodies (Anderson et al. 2017; Dumoulin et al. 2002) . In addition, sdAb is easily selected and cloned by selection systems such as phage, yeast, or ribosomal display (Harmsen and De Haard 2007; Muyldermans et al. 2009 ). These attributes make sdAbs suitable for many medical, biotechnological, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications (Arbabi-Ghahroudi 2017; Bannas et al. 2017; Beghein and Gettemans 2017; Gonzalez-Sapienza et al. 2017) .",

PEDV encodes four major structural proteins, membrane (M) (27-32 kDa), envelope (E) (7 kDa), spike (S) (180-220 kDa), and nucleocapsid (N) (55-58 kDa) (Utiger et al. 1995; Yeo et al. 2003) . The M protein is the most abundant of structural proteins and is involved in the assembly of viral nucleocapsid and membrane. In addition, the nucleotide sequence of the M gene is highly conserved among different PEDV strains but shows little homology with other coronaviruses (Kim and Chae 2000) . Thus, the M protein has been used as a target antigen for PEDV detection (Ren et al. 2011; Shenyang et al. 2007) .",

Further evaluation, the affinity by ITC 200 system (Supplementary material) showed that sdAb-Mcs unfold equilibrium binding constant value from 8.13 \u00d7 10 \u22129 to 357 \u00d7 10 \u22129 M to M protein (Table S1) that was similar with the published sdAbs (Harmsen et al. 2006; Li et al. 2012) .

Moreover, the ability of QD-sdAb to act as targeting probes for imaging PEDV in vero cells was evaluated by direct immunofluorescence assay. The observed fluorescence in vero cells stained with QD-sdAb probe nicely reflected that PEDV virions can be reliably recognized and labeled by QD-sdAb probe that was further confirmed by an indirect immunofluorescence assay and qRT-PCR. As a diagnostic reagent, QD-sdAb probe used in direct immunofluorescence assay showed high efficiency with lesser steps and shorter times compared with indirect immunofluorescence assay. Additionally, as a molecular tracer, sdAb has been used to tracing antigens in different subcellular compartments in living cells (Rothbauer et al. 2006) , targeting brain epitopes by transmigrating through blood-brain barrier (Abulrob et al. 2005) and detecting the activity of cell proteins in vivo (Iqbal et al. 2010 ).

For the viruses, however, most applications focus on efficient and rapid detection. Whether the viruses separated by nanoparticles can be propagated in cells and used for further research is still not clear. Thus, magnetic nanobeads were functionalized with sdAb-Mc29 and were tried to be used as a tool for the isolation of virus in this study. The characteristics of binders were responsible for the final application of its functionalized nanobeads. Fortunately, sdAb-Mc29 showed excellent specificity and affinity but did not have neutralizing activity, which perfectly fit the destination of this research. For the analysis of the capture activity, IMNBs were incubated with recombinant M protein and CV777. The captured M protein was clearly reflected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Meanwhile, virions around the IMNBs were observed directly by TEM, suggesting that PEDV can be separated from mixture of cells by the IMNBs.",

Interestingly, the cytopathic effects were observed at 12 h post-incubation of IMNBs-virus composite with vero cells that was not observed on the control cells. The further assay of direct immunofluorescence assay, qPCR, TEM, and spike protein gene sequencing confirmed that one epidemic strain of PEDV named JXDV1801 was successfully isolated by using IMNBs. The growth kinetics analysis indicated that JXDV1801 can replicate efficiently and propagate stably in vero cells. Thus, a novel, practicable, and efficient tool for PEDV isolation from clinical complex samples was developed in this research. Our research expanded the spectrum of application of sdAb and provided a novel method for isolation of virus from clinical samples.",

The IMNBs-M composites were collected by a magnetic scaffold. M protein binding with IMNBs (lane 1), input (lane 2), and in supernatant (lane 3) was showed by SDS-PAGE and evaluated by Western blot (lanes 4-6) based on PEDV positive porcine serum and HRP conjugated anti-pig antibody. b The binding capability of IMNBs to PEDV virions was examined by TEM. IMNBs were incubated with supernatant of PEDVinfected vero cells. The IMNBs-virions composites were collected by a magnetic scaffold and observed by TEM. IMNBs and virus particles are indicated by arrows the unique property of sdAb. In practice, the high yield and solubility of sdAb are well within the range needed for most applications.",
