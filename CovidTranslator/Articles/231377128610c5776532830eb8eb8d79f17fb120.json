Previously, the human DEAD-box helicase DDX1 was suggested to be involved in Rev functions, but this relationship is not well understood. Biochemical studies of DDX1 and its interactions with Rev and model RNA oligonucleotides were carried out to investigate the molecular basis for association of these components. A combination of gel-filtration chromatography and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that recombinant DDX1 expressed in E. coli is a well-behaved folded protein. Binding assays using fluorescently-labeled Rev and cell-based immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed a specific RNA-independent DDX1-Rev interaction. Additionally, DDX1 was shown to be an RNA-activated ATPase, wherein Revbound RNA was equally effective at stimulating ATPase activity as protein-free RNA. Gel mobility shift assays further demonstrated that DDX1 forms complexes with Rev-bound RNA. RNA silencing of DDX1 provided strong evidence that DDX1 is required for both Rev activity and HIV production from infected cells. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a clear link between DDX1 and HIV-1 Rev in cell based assays of HIV-1 production, and provide the first demonstration that recombinant DDX1 binds Rev and RNA, and has RNA dependent catalytic activity.",

            "text": "After cellular entry and genomic integration by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1), the HIV-1 Rev protein regulates the timing of viral gene expression that ensures completion of the viral life cycle [1] [2] [3] . Rev functions in part by promoting the nuclear export of unspliced and incompletely-spliced viral mRNAs, resulting in the expression of the late stage genes and providing genomic RNA for incorporation into virions. For this function, Rev overcomes cellular restrictions that prevent the nuclear export of incompletely processed RNA. Promotion of nuclear transport occurs through oligomeric binding of Rev on the Rev Response element (RRE) (Figure 1 ), a specific binding site within the viral RNA, which targets the RNA for nuclear export by the CRM-1 export receptor pathway. Specific oligomerization of Rev on the RRE involves well defined oligomerization domains (OD 1 & OD 2 in Figure 1a ) involving a helix-turn-helix motif. However it is unknown how viral RNA is released from nuclear retention sites, and it is not certain what other cellular factors are required for nuclear export of viral mRNA. Furthermore, Rev has also been linked to the translation of certain HIV-mRNAs 4, 5, 6 and to encapsidation of the viral genome 6, 7 . The mechanisms of Rev activity in these functions and their required cellular factors are poorly understood. Furthermore, it remains to be determined how these Rev-accessory factors function in uninfected cells and how Rev utilizes their activities during infection.",

However, the diverse cellular activities and biochemical properties of the DEAD-box family of proteins make it difficult to accurately predict the relationships between mechanism and function of its individual members in specific contexts. The human DEAD-box protein DDX1 has been proposed to contribute to viral replication by acting as a cofactor for Rev, and a region of Rev that might functionally interact with DDX1 has been identified 9 .

DDX1 is expressed in essentially all cell types in mammals (http://biogps.gnf.org/), is primarily localized either within the nucleus 14 or in the cytoplasm 8 depending on the cell type, and has been observed as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein.

DEAD-box proteins commonly function as ATPdependent RNA helicases, but the enzymatic activity of these proteins can vary widely [17] [18] [19] . The typical DEAD-box protein contains a helicase core consisting of nine conserved motifs distributed between N-terminal (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) RecA like domains. Sequence diversity among DEAD-box proteins is found in N and C terminal extensions of the helicase core and in the flexible linker connecting the two RecA like domains. DEAD-box proteins frequently bind nonspecifically to regions of double stranded RNA and mediate conformational changes in the RNA in an ATP-dependent manner. RNA binding and conformational changes are coupled with protein conformational changes within the helicase core that are linked to a cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis. While this is a general model for activity, there is significant variability in RNA specificity and catalytic parameters of ATP hydrolysis among DEAD-box family members. Values of k cat and K m (ATP) can range over two orders of magnitude 17, 19 , and therefore understanding a particular DEAD-box protein requires study of its own catalytic parameters, as well as investigation of other cellular factors that contribute to its function.",

Interestingly, while preparations enriched in recombinant DDX1 can hydrolyze ATP and unwind double stranded RNA when extracted from cultured Sf21 cells 20 , recombinant DDX1 has been reported to lack ATP dependent RNA-unwinding activity when purified from E. coli 20, 21 . In addition, DDX1 is unique among DEAD-box proteins as it includes a SPRY domain inserted between the Q-motif and the NTD, which may mediate protein-protein association 22, 23 and enzymatic activity ( Figure 1 ). DDX1 interacts with an N-terminal sequence of the Rev oligomerization domain (termed the Nuclear Diffusion Inhibitory Signal, NIS) ( Figure 1 ) in yeast-two-hybrid experiments 9 and has also been proposed to bind specifically to RRE-RNA from interpretations of cell-based assays 9 . However, quantitative binding data has not been obtained for direct interactions between DDX1 and Rev or DDX1 and RRE-containing RNA.",

However, a more through understanding of the relationships between DDX1, Rev function, and the viral life cycle is necessary. Here, we describe how DDX1 interacts with the HIV-1 Rev protein by quantitative binding assays and quantify the enzymatic parameters of DDX1-ATPase activity in the presence of RRE-related RNAs. These RNAs included a 351 nucleotide oligomer comprising the viral RRE sequence 24 and a 35 nucleotide oligomer representing stem IIB 25 , the initial site of Rev binding 26, 27 (Figure 1 ). In addition, we describe quantitative measurements of both a Rev dependent transactivation assay and a viral replication assay in cells where DDX1 is downregulated by RNAi. Collectively, the results of these experiments provide a clear link between DDX1, Rev function, and the HIV-1 lifecycle. Furthermore, they provide the most detailed characterizations to date of molecular interactions with DDX1 and its enzymatic properties. These results will serve as an important platform for future studies of DDX1 mechanism and function.",

Because of the wide range in enzymatic activity observed for DEAD-box proteins, it was important to determine if the recombinant DDX1 was compactly folded prior to enzymatic characterization. Gel filtration analysis revealed that DDX1 eluted from the column in a single peak in 500 mM KCl, with the retention expected for a monomeric ~80 KDa protein ( Figure 3 ). A small shoulder consistent with dimeric DDX1 was also visible, but this represented only a small fraction of the total protein. In contrast, DDX1 eluted as several peaks in 150 mM KCl corresponding to monomer, dimer, and larger aggregate. This chromatogram demonstrated that 10 \u03bcM recombinant DDX1 self-associates in a salt sensitive manner at 25\u00b0C.

Western blotting with anti-Rev and anti-DDX1 clearly demonstrated that DDX1 and Rev were pulled down by anti-V5, whereas IgG did not adsorb either protein. Rev self-associates into higher order oligomers through a helix-turn-helix oligomerization domain 31 , and oligomerization is proposed to contribute to both nuclear import of Rev from the cytoplasm 1,32 and nuclear export of Rev-RRE complexes via the Crm1 pathway 2 . Additionally, the first helix of the Rev oligomerization domain (OD1) overlaps with the NIS (Figure 1 ). The effects of mutations of apolar residues to polar residues within OD1 (V16D and L18T) on the interaction between DDX1 and Rev were determined using the immunoprecipitation assay. The mutation I55N in (OD2) (Figure 1 ) was chosen because it is known to affect Rev oligomerization 33, 34 while being outside of the NIS. The double mutation V16D/I55N was chosen because of its well-characterized effects on Rev oligomerization 33, 34 . The V16D and I55N mutations highly attenuate oligomerization, and the double mutant protein remains primarily monomeric at \u03bcM concentrations 35 . In contrast, the L18T mutation results in a protein that is less prone to oligomerize than wild-type Rev but is still capable of forming higher order oligomers 33 . The V16D, I55N, and V16D/I55N variants of Rev did not coimmunoprecipitate a significant quantity of DDX1 in the assay. However, the L18T variant was indistinguishable from wild-type Rev.",

ATP hydrolysis was measured as a function of 351nt RRE, stem IIB RNA and yeast tRNA phe at 2.5 mM ATP. tRNA was used as a non-specific control since it is highly structured and does not contain sequence homology to RRE RNA. Hydrolysis curves presented in Figure 5 indicate k max and K app (RNA) values for HIV-1-derived RNAs are similar within error, whereas tRNA phe is less optimal RNA substrate for stimulating DDX1 ATPase activity than either RRE or stem IIB as k max (tRNA) is 77% of k max (RRE) and the K app (tRNA) was 10 fold larger than K app (RRE). This suggests that the viral-derived RNAs may represent specific RNA targets for DDX1. For all RNAs tested, the observed kinetic parameters are within the published range for other RNA-stimulated ATPase activity of DEAD Box proteins 5, 11, 37 , although DDX1 is among the slowest reported. In terms of K app , the values for HIV-1 derived RNAs with DDX1 are near the middle values reported for DEAD-box protein-RNA values while the K app are near the high extreme values for DDX1-tRNA phe 5,11,37 .",

Additionally, these siRNAs inhibited expression of a reporter gene whose production was driven by Rev/RRE but not expression of the same reporter driven by CTE. This effectively rules out off-target effects of the two siRNAs on general features of transcription, RNA metabolism, and translation. This approach, using two independent siRNAs that efficiently target DDX1 and that lack substantial nonspecific effects on gene expression, makes a decisive case for a role of DDX1 for HIV replication in the widely used model of HeLa cells.",

For example, DDX1 is overexpressed in retinoblastoma and has been found co-amplified with neuronal Myc in neuroblastoma cell lines and primary tumor specimens 23, 41 . Overexpression of DDX1 has also been linked with stem cell-associated genes in human testicular germ cell tumors 13 and as a prognostic marker for recurrence of breast cancer 42 . Furthermore, DDX1 contributes to the life cycle of several viruses. It promotes the proliferation of human polyomavirus 43 , and it contributes to coronavirus replication in cell culture 44 . DDX1 is also associated with the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the hepatitis C virus genome in human liver cells 16 .

Under the conditions of the in vitro binding assay, the protein-protein interaction between DDX1 and Rev occurs with a disassociation constant on the order of tens of nanomolar. While this is relatively tight for a protein-protein interaction, it is considerably weaker than oligomeric binding of Rev on the RRE, which occurs in the sub-nanomolar range 33, 35, 39 . The relative difference in these affinities is consistent with previous estimates from cell-based studies of the DDX1-Rev interaction 9 . These observations demonstrate that the purified RRE complexes containing both Rev and DDX1 are mediated through protein-RNA contacts and not protein-protein interactions. The lack of cooperativity between a protein-protein interaction and RNA binding by Rev and DDX1 may result from sequestering the NIS within Rev oligomers on the RRE. Sequestering of protein-protein interaction domains within the oligomeric and RNA binding interfaces could be a general method of regulating protein cofactor binding to Rev. For instance, the interaction between nuclear import factors and Rev has been observed to occur through interactions within the nuclear localization signal inside arginine rich domain of the RBD/ OD 2 3,45 .",

One possibility may be to prevent diffusion of Rev from the nucleus prior to binding on the RRE. At steady state, Rev displays a nuclear and nucleolar distribution in cells 27, 46 . The diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of Rev observed in DDX1 silenced cells is vary similar to the distribution that has been observed for double mutants containing the V16D variant of Rev 47 and for Rev variants that have been constructed to lack the NIS sequence 48 . It is possible that the disruption of the DDX1-Rev interaction caused by the V16D mutation results in the same change in Rev localization that is observed in DDX1 silenced cells. Another possible function may be to assist in the formation of complexes containing Rev-RRE RNA and DDX1. In the crowded and compartmentalized environment of the nucleus, a preloaded Rev-RRE complex may have a kinetic advantage in forming the ternary complex. It is conceivable that Rev interaction with DDX1 could prevent other, nonproductive interactions with competing cellular components or nonproductive Rev oligomers. The relatively tighter Rev-RRE interaction could assist in disrupting the Rev-DDX1 complex while still allowing for a productive Rev-RRE-DDX1 complex assembled through protein-RNA interactions. In this manner, the Rev-DDX1 complex could serve to specifically target DDX1 to unspliced and incompletely spliced HIV transcripts in the nucleus. This could promote CRM1-mediated export of the RREcontaining transcripts by several mechanisms, which could include hypothetical DDX1facilitated release of the transcripts from nuclear retention sites. Notwithstanding our findings, it is possible that the in vitro system is missing levels of posttranslational regulation that could influence the relativity dissociation constants of the complex. All of these possibilities warrant further investigation and the in vitro experiments using recombinant proteins and synthetic RNAs should be considered the first step in this process.",

It is tempting to infer from these results that Rev oligomerization is required for functional association with DDX1. However, the oligomerization state of Rev is dependent on several factors including solution conditions 30 , Rev secondary structure 33 , and as recently demonstrated by alternative crystal structures of dimers of the Rev oligomerization domain, both differences in protein sequence 49 and interaction with other proteins 50 . Additionally, the interaction between the NIS sequence of Rev and DDX1 was identified in a yeast-two-hybrid assay with a NIS based peptide that would not preserve the oligomerization state of the Rev protein but could still retain helical propensity. Both V16D and I55N are highly disruptive of Rev secondary and tertiary structure 33 . It is possible that disruptions of the helical structure of the oligomerization domain in these variants contributes more to the loss of interaction with DDX1 than is due to either the loss of specific residue contacts between Rev and DDX1 or the loss of Rev oligomerization. Structural and DDX1 binding studies with synthetic peptides based on the NIS sequence could be very valuable for investigating the mechanism of the DDX1-Rev interaction.",

The simplest source of variability among DEAD-box proteins are differences in the structure and dynamics of the enzyme active sites that affect ATP binding primarily through conserved residues in the NTD. Additional residues in the N-terminal Q motif also contribute to nucleotide recognition. DDX1 is unique among DEAD-box proteins due to the inclusion of a SPRY domain between the Q-motif and the NTD. It seems reasonable that the SPRY domain could dramatically alter the relationship between the NTD and Q-motif and therefore affect ATPase activity. However, because the rates and K m values for DDX1 are within the range of other DEAD-box proteins, structural differences in the active site are likely to be similar to other slow DEAD-box proteins and not due to a gross alteration of the protein conformation. It remains possible that specific protein cofactors could interact with the SPRY domain and induce conformational changes in DDX1 that result in a more optimal enzyme. As the list of possible cellular partners for DDX1 grows, it will be interesting to determine if this mechanism provides a means of regulating activity.",

The most thoroughly studied examples are members of the DbpA subfamily whose optimal ATP hydrolysis occurs only with the 23S rRNA as a substrate 51 . Because it had not been previously determined if RRE RNA was a specific substrate for DDX1, the ATPase activity was compared using two synthetic RNA constructs based on the RRE and tRNA phe as a nonspecific control at a single ATP concentration. There is a modest enhancement of k max and a more significant decrease in K app (RNA) when HIV-1-derived RNAs are compared to the less-optimal tRNA phe . tRNA is a highly structured RNA with a compact tertiary structure. In contrast, Stem IIB consists only of short stretches of duplex RNA, bulged base pairs and an unpaired loop. Given the modest k max values for both RRE and Stem IIB, it is likely the enhancements seen for the HIV-1derived RNAs reflect the difficulty in binding a highly folded tRNA as a substrate. The observed kinetics may also reflect a preference for either double stranded or partially unpaired double stranded substrates. Such a preference would be consistent with the recent observation of DDX1 cellular localization at the site of double stranded DNA breaks that result from ionizing radiation 21 .",

For example, the ATPase activity of the E. coli DEADbox protein RhlB is highly stimulated by interactions with RNase E 52 . Down regulation of DEAD-box protein activity by protein cofactors has also been observed, as in the case of the competitive inhibition of DBP5 by the nucleoporin NUP214 53 . The effects of Rev on the ATPase properties of DDX1 were an open question. Rev neither activates nor down regulates DDX1 in the range of the tested conditions. When compared to highly active DEAD-box proteins, recombinant DDX1 has a relatively low k max and moderate K app (RNA) RRE-stimulated ATPase activity. This may reflect a cellular function that uses catalytic activity for a cycle of binding and release rather than for processive disruption of complex RNA structure. Such cellular function has been suggested for Rok1p and Rrp3p in yeast ribosome biogenesis 17 . Furthermore, eIF4AIII is a welldocumented example that does not require ATP hydrolysis for its role as an accessory protein in the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) 54 . Alternatively, the modest k max value of DDX1 may reflect that of an enzyme requiring post-translational modification for full activity. This would be consistent with the observation that epitope tagged DDX1 purified from human cell culture was more active than E.coli purified DDX1 20 . In either case, the enzymatic activity of recombinant DDX1 stimulated by Rev-bound RRE indicates the recombinant enzyme retains some functionality of native DDX1. It is therefore reasonable to use recombinant DDX1 as a starting point for future investigations of the specific molecular mechanisms that regulate DDX1 enzymatic activity and to discover how these mechanisms contribute to the HIV-1 lifecycle.",

The amplified DDX1 (1-428) gene fragment was inserted into pET22-HT and expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. DDX1 (1-428) protein was purified on an Ni-NTA affinity column followed by a Q HP Sepharose column as described above. Pure DDX1 (1-428) was dialyzed against storage buffer (25 mM Tris, 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA) and stored at 4\u00b0C for use. HIV-1 Rev expression, purification and labeling were conducted as described previously 33, 35 ",

High-Purity yeast tRNA phe was purchased from Sigma. The interaction of DDX1 with RRE and Rev-RRE was measured as previously described 33 DDX1 silencing in HeLa cells leads to selective loss of Rev/RRE-dependent Gag expression from a HIV-1 subgenomic reporter, and inhibits virus production by infected cells. a) Schematics of Gag constructs used for the screening of Rev/RRE and CTE transactivation. Both plasmids contain part of the 5\u2032-LTR and the coding region for the Gag and PR domains of HIV-1. In addition, pGag-RRE contains part of the env gene containing the RRE, and pGag-CTE contains 4 copies of the CTE of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus. b) Western blots of cells treated with control siRNA or two different siRNAs targeting DDX1 (A and B) and transfected with reporters. Silencing of DDX1 leads to strong reduction of Gag expression from pGag-RRE but not from the pGag-CTE construct, as compared to cells treated with control siRNA. c) Quantification of Gag expression levels from pGag-RRE and pGag-CTE demonstrate a 5 fold reduction in Gag expression from the RRE construct in DDX1 silenced cells but only minor loss of Gag from the CTE construct. d) Effects of DDX1 silencing on virus production. Downregulation of DDX1 with each of two siRNAs strongly reduces p24 capsid release from cells, relative to control siRNA. Gel filtration and Circular Dichroism spectra of 10 \u03bcM DDX1. a) DDX1 elution from Superdex 200 column in 500 mM KCl at 25 \u00b0C. Absorption spectra were normalized to the highest point. The primary elution peak is consistent with the expected retention for an ~80 kDa protein, corresponding to monomeric DDX1 Superimposed on this elution profile is the independent elution of the molecular weight standards used to calibrate the column (gray) The 158KD and 44KD standards are indicated by arrows. b) DDX1 elution in 150 mM KCl at 25 \u00b0C. Peaks centered at 14, 12 and 11 mL retention times are consistent with monomeric DDX1, dimeric DDX1 and higher order aggregates, respectively. c) CD spectra of DDX1 in 500 mM KCl at 25 \u00b0C. The negative peaks near 210 nm and 219 nm are consistent with a protein containing mixed a-helix and b-sheet secondary structure. d) CD spectra of DDX1 in 150 mM KCl at 25 \u00b0C. This spectrum is identical within error to that of DDX1 in 500 mM KCl. Coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous DDX1 with transfected Rev-V5 (WT) vs oligomerization incompetent Rev-V5 mutants from HeLa cells. Western blot analysis of whole cell extract (input) and immunoprecipitatesof RNase-treated cell extracts with anti-V5-antibody or a control IgG by anti-DDX1 antibody or anti-V5-antibody. DDX1 associates with Rev (WT), but not with the Rev oligomerization incompetent mutants Rev(V16D), Rev (I55N), or Rev (V16D/I55N). DDX1 and Rev bind independently to RRE RNA. a) Electrophoretic gel mobility shift titration of DDX1 into radiolabeled RRE RNA, with the bands corresponding to free RRE, DDX1-RRE complex and DDX1 concentration through the titration denoted. b) DDX1 titration into radiolabeled RRE RNA in the presence of 375 nM Rev protein. Oligomeric Rev forms a tight complex with RRE RNA as indicated by the first shifted band. DDX1 binds independently to the Rev-RRE complex, seen as a supershifted band at increasing concentrations of DDX1. Bands corresponding to free RRE, Rev-RRE and DDX1-Rev-RRE complexes are labeled. c) Plot showing the fraction of DDX1 bound to labeled RRE RNA or Rev-RRE complex as a function of DDX1 concentration. The fraction of bound DDX1 was calculated as the disappearance of free RRE where black circles represent the direct titration of DDX1 in three independent trials described in a) and red triangles denote the disappearance of free RRE and Rev-RRE bands described in b).
