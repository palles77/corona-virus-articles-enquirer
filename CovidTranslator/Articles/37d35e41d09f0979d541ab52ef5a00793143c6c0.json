            "text": "Mammalian cells expose wide arrays of complex glycoconjugates on their surfaces. These carbohydrate structures are playing critical roles in multiple key cellular events, several of which being characterized by weak but multivalent carbohydrate-protein interactions. 1 Thus, multiantennary glycans on glycoproteins, polysaccharides, or on patches of glycolipids constitute a first line of weak contacts with pathogens bearing the corresponding carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD). Cell-cell communications also apply carbohydrates as signals. In spite of these ubiquitous phenomena, the basic carbohydrate structures recognized by carbohydrate-binding proteins are surprisingly simple, with at best a tri-or tetrasaccharide moiety being deeply involved in the protein's active sites, unless conformational epitopes are involed. 2 Additionally, several proteins or interactive mechanisms utilize a limited set of similar sugars, thus further raising the issues of selectivities. For instance, the innate immune system exploits the structures of mannosides on yeast, fungi, and bacteria through the mannose-binding protein (MBP) as the first defense mechanism against this type of infectious agents. Yet, dendritic cells, macrophages, and hepatocytes also utilize mannosides against pathogens and cellular recognition or activation. Paradoxically, bacteria, such as fimbriated Escherichia coli (E. coli), possess proteins at the tip of their fimbriae (FimH) that also recognize and bind to mannosides of host human tissues as the premise for bacterial infections. Obviously then, the sole carbohydrate structures, taken individually, could not account for the large multivalent interactions that solicit a given glycan. Consequently, valencies, geometries, and topographical saccharide arrangements must be keys for the high selectivities and affinities observed. With these questions in mind, glycodendrimers [3] [4] [5] [6] were born to address fundamental aspects in multivalent carbohydrate-protein interactions that could not be resolved with glycopolymers. [7] [8] [9] Moreover, dendrimers can be assembled with an infinite variety of chemical architectures and exposed number of carbohydrate moieties. 10,10a,10b,11 They may also constitute an arsenal of new therapeutic agents as well as being useful for specific cell targeting.",

One such possibility would be the inhibition of attachment of the infecting pathogens to the host's cell surfaces. [12] [13] [14] The attachment is often a prerequisite for the later stages of infection, colonization, and invasion of specific human tissues. Since the chemical structure of the adhesion inhibitors most likely would be quite similar to the natural attachment ligands used by the pathogenic agents, it is unlikely that resistance (mutations) would give them the capability to overcome the inhibitory effect of the antiadhesive drug without impairing their ability to adhere to the host cells. Glycodendrimers are therefore definitely suitable for the inhibition of bacterial adhesions to host tissues ( Figure 1) .",

            "text": "A wide variety of proteins can bind D-mannopyranoside residues including high-mannose oligosaccharides. 20 Of these, plant lectins, particularly Concanavalin A (ConA), Dioclea grandiflora, and pea lectins, have been extensively studied from the point of view of X-ray crystallographic analysis, isothermal titration microcalorimetry (IC), as well as for fundamental aspects related to multivalent interactions and glycodendrimer bindings. Of particular interest to this review are the binding of mannosides to human monoclonal antibody 2G12 recognizing Man 9 GlcNAc 2 from HIV-1 gp120 and the related cyanovirin-N isolated from the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum; MBP of the innate immune system; DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin) (ICAM-3\u00bcintercellular adhesion molecule) present on dendritic cells and responsible for the binding of T-lymphocytes; human mannose receptors on resident macrophages and finally bacteria through their fimbriated type 1 proteins such as present in E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Serratia marcescens, and Shigella flexneri. Other related mannosidebinding proteins but not discussed herein include Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA), scytovirin, Scilla campanulata lectin (SCL), Narcissus pseudonarcissus lectin (NPL), Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA), jacalin, and Myrianthus holstii lectin (myrianthin, MHL). Figure 2 illustrates the crystal structure of the HIV-1 neutralizing human antibody 2G12 bound to the oligomannoside Man 9 GlcNAc 2 present on the 'silent' face of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein. 21 The antibody adopts an unusual domain-swapped dimeric structure originating from interdigitation of Fab domains. Interestingly, the oligomannoside is similarly bound into the active site of cyanovirin ( Figure 3 ). 22 While cyanovirin prefers the D1-D3 branched mannosides, the antibody 2G12 is localized in the ManCManD 1 ManD 2 area. Consequently, several groups are involved in the synthetic design of properly oriented mannoside clusters for vaccination purpose. [23] [24] [25] The resulting vaccines should trigger specific, high-affinity antibodies against the carbohydrate portion of HIV's gp120.",

The two binding sites are 35\u00c5 apart; thus, a single Man 9 GlcNAc 2 residue is too small to provide a chelate effect on the two active sites simultaneously. Figure 3 illustrates the X-ray structure of the protein with bound Man 9 GlcNAc 2 in its high-affinity site together with the bound conformation of the saccharide.

This suggests that the CRD sites are ideally configured for multivalent interactions, thereby increasing the binding affinity of hMBP to pathogens.

Type 1 fimbriae are the most common type of adhesive appendages in E. coli and several other enterobacteria and mediate mannose-specific adhesion via the 30 kDa lectin-like subunit FimH. 46 The crystal structure of the FimH from uropathogenic E. coli, primarily causing pyelonephritis, has been solved together with methyl a-D-mannopyranoside ( 1) as well as with the hydrophobic butyl a-D-mannopyranoside. 47 The strongest monovalent inhibitor known to date for the FimH is heptyl a-D-mannopyranoside (5 , K D 5nM) which is thus eight times better than the known p-nitrophenyl a-D -mannopyranoside (2 , PNPaMan, K D 44nM) and four times better than methyl umbelliferyl a-D-Man ( 4, K D 20nM). Table 1 shows the relative affinities, K D , and DG of a series of synthetic mannoside derivatives ( Figure 6 ) against the FimH of E. coli K12 as measured by surface plasmon resonance. 47 Among the series of alkyl mannosides tested from methyl up to octyl, there were 1000-fold increases from ethyl to higher homologs and a steady increase up to the heptyl mannoside (5) after which, the K D started to increase. It is also noticeable that the hydrophobic aglycons of the best candidates are flanked by two tyrosine residues (Tyr48 and Tyr 137) in the active site ( Figure 7 ) that may provide the rationale for the observed, more than two decades ago, high affinities of o-chloro-p-nitrophenyl a-D-mannoside (3) against other strains of E. coli (346 (025) and 128). 48,48a Indeed, Figure 5 Crystal structure of trimeric hMBP with high-mannose glycan. The yellow spheres are calcium. (S. Sheriff, personal communication.) in inhibition of yeast aggregation by the bacteria, compound 3 showed relative inhibitory behavior that was 717 and 470 times better than the reference compound 1, respectively ( Figure 6 ). In a recent study from this laboratory (unpublished data), a small library of mannoside analogs was constructed to build a QSAR model for the FimH. The library included several C-linked mannosides, a few of which (cpds 6, 7) were almost equivalent to PNP aMan. These C-glycosides are valuable candidates for in vivo assays since they are stable under physiological conditions. Moreover, they are suitably functionalized for further manipulations such as those encountered in typical glycodendrimer syntheses. It is our opinion that the most potent glycodendrimers will be those constructed using the best monovalent aglycons together with optimized scaffolds, valencies, and linker distances. These factors should necessarily vary from one receptor to another.",

            "text": "Basically, there are two key strategies for building glycodendrimers ( Figure 9 ). The first one involves the initial synthesis of core molecules by a divergent process. In this approach, the focal and multifunctional molecules are systematically expanded outward using various chemical linkages. For instance, PAMAM-based dendrimers use a,odiamines as core (e.g., 1,2-ethylenediamine, 1,4-butanediamine, etc.), the amines of which are then treated with methyl acrylate by a double N-alkylation. The ensuing esters are reacted with a large excess of 1,2-ethylenediamine to provide the first generation G0 bearing four amine functionalities. This process (alkylation/amidation) is sequentially repeated from the 'heart' of the molecules until the desired external valencies are reached. The sugars are then appended at the molecules' periphery. The growth is doubly exponential (2 n ) but the number of surface groups may vary depending on the number of functionalities on the 'seeding' molecules, for example, 2,4,8. . .; 3,6,12. . .; 4,8,16. . .; etc. The main disadvantage of the divergent growth is the necessity for an increasing number of efficacious reactions required to obtain defect-free dendrimers that are otherwise difficult to purify given the small differences in their size and number of functional groups. The second approach, the convergent growth strategy, avoids several of the synthetic challenges inherent to the one described above. The procedure involves the construction of glycodendrons (wedges) that are useful on their own followed by their attachment to multivalent core structures. The procedure is simplified because the number of coupling partners is reduced to a minimum at any particular step. Moreover, the target molecules, by virtue of its higher molecular weight in comparison to their fragments are simpler to purify by size exclusion chromatography. The number of peripheral carbohydrate moieties that cause steric inaccessibility eventually limits the technique. Nevertheless, it is now well established that a large number of surface carbohydrate moieties are detrimental to the carbohydrate accessibility by carbohydrate-binding receptors. Doubly convergent approaches have also been described. In these cases, the core molecules are first assembled with several surface functional groups that could be directly attached to glycodendrons.",

Using dendrons having eight sialosides on the surface, Roy et al. were able to demonstrate that each saccharide residue was 1000-fold better, on a per saccharide basis than the corresponding monomer. 57 They were however not as efficient as polymers because they could not cover efficiently the surfaces of the spherical viral particles, a property well exploited by random coiled polymers. It was later argued that dendronized polymers were even more potent in this respect. 57 When the same poly-L-lysine scaffold was utilized with mannoside residues bearing an arylated aglycon (partly optimized monomer), the resulting 8-mer glycondendron happened to show 100000-fold increased inhibitory potency against fimbriated E. coli K12 on a per mannoside basis. 58 The structures of the corresponding sialo-( Figure 10 ) and manno-dendrimers ( Figure 11 ) are illustrated below.",

Since these cells expose MBPs, they constitute powerful candidates for vaccine targeting. Thus, instead of associating short immunogenic peptides to protein carriers, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or bovine serum albumin (BSA), 65 Chang and co-workers have recently investigated the possibility of using mannoside-capped polylysine glycodendrimers (10 ) constructed at the N-terminal of several immunogenic peptides ( Figure 12 ). 66 Peptide sequences from HIV gp41 protein (541-555 bearing the LLSGIV motif capable of inhibiting viral fusion, 553-567), 67 SARS-CoV S2 (1081-1105, 1144-1187), and influenza hemagglutinin HA2 (1-25) were built on a Rink amide resin. The lysine moieties were then introduced as a G-3 lysine dendrimer followed by mannosylation, using 4-mannosyloxy butanoic acid (8) at the terminal (e) amino groups of the lysyl-peptide dendrimer (9) . Preliminary data from vaccine 10 , containing the LLSGIV motif, demonstrated that it could elicit polyclonal antibodies response in rabbit much stronger than the KLH construct. It was concluded that the mannosylated dendron was stabilizing the antigenicity of the peptide by protecting it from proteolysis. N-terminally mannosylated peptides carrying one to six mannose residues were also shown by Koning and co-workers to elicit immune response with efficiency up to 104-fold greater than peptide antigens alone. 68 Mannose receptors are capable of mediating internalization of both soluble and particulate carbohydrate structures and as such they take part in innate immunity. 69 Figure 10 Non-optimized a-thiosialo-dendrimer bearing eight residues based on a polylysine core.

This useful and efficient mode of coupling through isothiourea linkages was therefore used by several other groups and was nicely exploited by Lindhorst 5 and Cloninger. 6 The first four generations of this novel class of monodispersed neoglycoconjugates having up to 32 mannoside units were evaluated as ligands for the phytohemagglutinins from ConA and Pisum sativum (pea lectin) using enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) and turbidimetric analysis. The binding properties of these glycodendrimers, together with reference monosaccharides, were determined using yeast mannan as a coating antigen and peroxidase-labeled lectins. These mannosylated dendrimers were demonstrated to be potent inhibitors with IC 50 values 400 times better than those of monomeric methyl a-D-mannopyranoside taken as a standard.",

            "text": "Pieters and co-workers have described the preparation and evaluation of multivalent mannosides, including small divalent systems, glycodendrimers, and glycopolymers, as inhibitors of type 1 fimbriated uropathogenic E. coli . The mannosylated surface groups were obtained by an amide bond formation between 3-aminopropyl a-mannopyranoside that was pretreated with diglycolic anhydride. Typical BOP or TBTU peptide coupling reagents were used to furnish the desired PAMAM-dendrimers (21 ) (Figure 19 ). 82 A novel and easy bioassay was set for this purpose. The mannosylated dendrimers to be tested were used in an ELISA-based assay for their ability to inhibit the binding of mannose-binding type 1 fimbriated E. coli (FimH) to a monolayer of T24 cell lines derived from human urinary bladder epithelium. The PAMAM mannodendrimers displayed the highest affinity towards the target, although their relative potency per mannose was rather low. Glycopolymers with 3-21 mannose residues per polymer showed enhanced activity with increasing mannose substitution up to an IC 50 as low as 12mM. The relative potency of the polymer series on a per mannoside basis was relatively constant at around 30-40. Cloninger and co-workers have similarly described first-through sixth-generation PAMAM dendrimers (256 surface groups) with mannoside residues and thiourea linkers. 6, 55, 83 When compared to methyl a-D-mannoside taken as control monomer, dendrimers G1 and G2 did not show any increase in activity toward the phytohemagglutinin ConA and the G3 dendrimer bound roughly one order of magnitude better than G1, G2, or methyl mannoside. This is suggestive of a glycoside clustering effect (enhanced local concentration). As with G1 and G2, G3 was too small for multivalent binding to occur (chelate effect). Dendrimers G4-G6 all showed increased activity against the tetrameric Con A of two orders of magnitude, indicating that multivalent binding was occurring. It is also possible that the change in shape from circular (G(1)-to G(3)-PAMAM) to spherical (G4-G6) caused the observed binding enhancement. It is to be noted that each of the four mannose-binding sites in ConA is $73\u00c5 apart from each other (calcium to calcium distances). Lectin cross-linking that only requires clusters to be <10\u00c5 apart may also cause the increase in affinity. Noteworthy is the fact that dimeric lectin only requires a dimeric cluster for this to happen. Cyanovirin-N (CV-N) recognizes Mana1-2Man disaccharide and higher homologs (see discussion above) that are present on terminal branches of high oligomannose structures present on viruses and other microbes. Cloninger and co-workers have investigated the relative inhibitory properties of fuctionalized Mana1-2Mana-PAMAM dendrimers ( 22) against their ability to bind CV-N ( Figure 20) . 84 In order to evaluate the mannosylated dendrimer-CV-N interactions, precipitation assays were performed. PAMAM-functionalized dendrimers induced precipitation of CV-N-dendrimer complexes. Titration of the soluble CV-N with increasing amounts of dendrimers showed a linear decrease in the absorbance, that is, an increase in the total amount of protein precipitated. These data translated to apparent stoichiometries of 8:1 and 11:1 for CV-N: dendrimer complexes for G3 and G4, respectively. The study of variously loaded saccharide-functionalized dendrimers provided other valuable information regarding multivalent binding. A number of constructs have been reported that vary the loading densities of carbohydrate antigens. In general, the most highly functionalized scaffolds were not the ones with the highest activity. 3,10,10a,17,17a,17b,51,56,62,78 Often, less-functionalized ligands can exhibit optimal activities. This was attributed to the fact that at high loading, the saccharide portions became less accessible due to an increase in steric hindrance. Another hypothesis is that with aromatic aglycons, p-stacking might further tighten the saccharide units on the dendrimer surfaces. In fact, PAMAM-dendrimers bearing more than 64 arylated mannoside moieties such as those seen in Figure 15 were experimenting solubility problems in aqueous environment.",

There was a significant increase in activity for the fourth, fifth, and sixth dendrimer generations. Maximum activity occurred at just over 50% sugar loading for all generations. The area available per sugar at maximum activity varied slightly for the different generations. The trends were similar in each case. The most striking observation was that the highest activity did not correlate with the maximum sugar loading, but rather occurred at slightly closer packing of the sugars as the generation increased. By analogy, the loading distributions of dendrimers bearing heterogeneous structures were evaluated. Hence, mannoside/TEMPO-functionalized PAMAM dendrimers were synthesized. 87 EPR analysis of these dendrimers suggested that all dendrimers had random distributions of surface functional groups. Comparison of hemagglutination assays between mannoside/ TEMPO-and mannoside/hydroxy-functionalized dendrimers suggests that the presence of the spin label had no influence on the dendrimer binding to ConA. Further derivatives were also recently described using PAMAM simultaneously functionalized with mannose, galactose, and glucose residues (24 ) (Figure 21 ). 86,88 MALDI-TOF MS was used to determine the number of carbohydrate residues of each type on the dendrimers. Both the change in MW after each sequential addition and the change in MW after deacylation were used. The association of these dendrimers with ConA was studied using precipitation and hemagglutination assays. Increasing the number of mannose residues while decreasing the number of glucose residues caused an increase in the relative activity toward ConA. As with the dendrimers bearing 50% mannose/glucose loading, a linear relationship between Man/Glc loading and assay activity was observed for compounds of generations 4-6. However, the difference between fully mannose-functionalized dendrimers and fully glucose-functionalized dendrimers never approached 16. For compounds of generation 3, mannose-functionalized dendrimers had a fivefold higher relative activity toward Con A than did the glucose-functionalized analogs.",

Such enhanced binding affinities have been attributed to the cluster effect. In light of the importance of the glycoside cluster effect in carbohydrate-protein interactions, Jayaraman and co-workers investigated the synthesis and properties of mannose-6-phosphate-functionalized PAMAM dendrimers (25) (Figure 22) . 90 The synthesis of dendritic Man-6-P was initiated from 2-N-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)ethyl 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzoyla-D-mannopyranoside, that was modified sequentially by (1) deprotection of the benzoyl esters; (2) tritylation of the primary hydroxyl group; and (3) benzoylation of the remaining hydroxy groups.

A dendrimer is characterized by a perfect symmetrical globular shape that results from a stepwise controlled process giving a monodisperse molecular weight distribution. The second category, the hyperbranched polymers are attractive because they resemble dendrimers (their difference lies in their polydispersity and the less-perfect globular shape) but they can be produced more easily on a larger scale and at a reasonable cost, thus making them commercially available in large quantities nowadays. Unlike conventional polymers, the high number of end groups and their nature participate actively in the physical properties (solubility, glass transition temperature, and viscosity) in combination with the backbone structures. This characteristic is exceptional because it leads to the possibility of designing the macromolecule with the combination of many different end groups. Rojo and co-workers have selected hyperbranched dendritic polymers named Boltorn \u00ae (Figure 8 ) for which second, third, and fourth generations are commercially available at a very low cost. This family of dendrimers varies by the numbers of hydroxyl surface groups: they are BoltornH20 (16 OH groups) and BoltornH30 (32 OH groups, on average). These dendritic polymers, which are based on the monomer 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid, have been functionalized with the mannosides. 94 These dendritic alcohols were transformed into carboxylic acid surface groups by treating BoltornH20 or H30 polymers with succinic anhydride in the presence of DMAP in pyridine. The resulting acids ( 27) were then mannosylated via an amide bond with unprotected 2-aminoethyl a-D-mannopyranoside (26 ) and DCC to provide mannodendrimer 28 ( Figure 23 ). The ester functionality of the backbone precluded the use of peracetylated sugars.",

Alternatively, the catalytic Cu(I) species could be generated in situ from CuSO 4 and sodium ascorbate. 105,105a The latter method eliminates the problem of byproduct formation and has been used successfully in several different solvent systems, including water.

A general and facile strategy for functional groups introduction at defined positions on dendrimers is best achieved when dendrimers are built by stepwise syntheses (Figure 27 ). Hawker and co-workers have described a fashion-controlled strategy toward glycodendrimers in which two distinct moieties (targeting and detection probe) were placed at the chain ends. 99 Click chemistry was used as the key step, thus allowing simple and original buildup of these bifunctional dendrimers.",

This procedure was successfully used to obtain clusters bearing methyl (69 ) and p-nitrophenyl (70 ) aglycons after branching through the C-6 amino position. The latter is of interest as aromatic moieties can increase the affinity of a given carbohydrate ligand to its lectin receptor by hydrophobic interactions. The inhibitory potency of p-nitrophenyl a-D-mannoside (pNPMan) was approximately 100 times higher than that of the respective methyl mannoside. Cluster 69 (R \u00bc CH 3 ) showed an IC 50 of 4nM and has surpassed the inhibitory potency of the cluster containing pNPMan. Only the spacer-modified mannosides 71 revealed interesting successful inhibition of type-1 fimbriae-mediated adhesion of E. coli to high mannose-type surfaces. None of these compounds reached the inhibitory potency of 69 (R \u00bc CH 3 ). These results were however somewhat surprising given the fact that fimbriated E. coli (FimH) prefers to bind mannosides from the nonreducing end (see Figure 7) , thus providing no room for the clusters to enter in the active site by their reducing end.",

The ligation of the maleimido-functionalized scaffold with the known SHtagged Man 9 GlcNAc 2 Asn provided the key immunogen. The obtained anti-sera was weakly cross-reactive to HIV-gp120. The majority of the IgG antibodies were directed against the linkers of the glycoconjugate.",

The lipophilic p-tert-butyl substituents provided the driving force for stable assembly and/or adhesion of a calixarene monolayer to a hydrophobic surface, while the hydrophilic carbohydrate tail mimicked cells saccharide-rich surfaces present on cancer tissues (T N -antigen, 115).

Hypervalent glycocalix [4] arene dendrimers demonstrated direct binding to VVA by the rapid formation of insoluble precipitates. The efficiency of glycocalixarenes to inhibit the binding of asialoglycophorin, a natural glycoprotein of human erythrocytes-blood group serotype, was measured by ELLA. The best result was obtained from the hexadecavalent conjugate (IC 50 , 13.4mM), which represents a 12-fold increase in potency over that of allyl a-D-GalNAc monomer (IC 50 , 158.3mM). The prepared glycocalixarene derivatives were also directly adsorbed onto the lipophilic surface of polystyrene microtiter plates and thus should be useful in bioanalytical devices. p-Tert-butylcalix [4] arene was also used by Roy and Meunier for the synthesis of a-sialylated-calix [4] arene. 121 Evidences for strong cross-linking ability with tetrameric wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a plant lectin known to bind sialosides, was detected with this tetramer.",

In spite of the fact that this relatively novel family of small macromolecules has been discovered in 1993, it is somewhat surprising that there are still no architectural rules governing the synthesis of the best candidates for any given applications. Through our own personal experience, we could conclude that, for now, glycopolymers still represent the most efficient candidates for targeting viral particles. However, with the scarce information available, it appeared that dendronized glycopolymers might offer clear advantages. The situation seems to be dramatically different when dealing with fimbriated bacteria and certainly so, to multimeric soluble carbohydrate-binding proteins such as lectins, galectins, antibodies, and so on. It is also somewhat surprising that the community has not yet concented for the use of the same bacterial strains when dealing with the inhibition of adhesion of fimbriated E. coli and related pathogens. This situation will have to be remedied in the near future if one wants to establish governing rules for the design of better and improved adhesion inhibitors.",

He is a native of Montreal where he received his education. He obtained his Ph.d. in chemistry in 1980 from the University of Montreal under the supervision of Prof. S. Hanessian. Prof. Roy joined the Division of the Biological Sciences of the National Research Council of Canada where he worked from 1980 to 1985 as a Research Fellow. He has contributed to the design of new bacterial polysaccharide vaccines and he is the co-inventor of the recently commercialized Neisseria meningitidis vaccine. He then joined the Department of Chemistry of the University of Ottawa, Ontario, where he worked until December 2002 before returning to his hometown in Montreal. In 1997, he received the Hoffmann-LaRoche award for his distinguished contribution to medicinal chemistry; in 2001, the Ottawa Life Science Council Award and the Paul Harris Fellowship. Prof. Roy has used modern synthetic chemistry to tackle problems associated with the synthesis and applications of neoglycoconjugates and polymers. He developed the concept of active and latent glycosidation methods applied to thioglycosides. His design of novel carbohydrate architectures, glycodendrimers, has paved the way for a better understanding of multivalent carbohydrate-protein interactions at the molecular level. He has recently contributed to the first semi-synthetic bacterial polysaccharide vaccine against H. influenza type b that was shown successful in infants. The clinical trials were done in Cuba and vaccines has been approved in 2003. Since 2003 he holds a Canadian Research Chair in Therapeutic Chemistry. Mohamed Touaibia was born and received his elementary education in T\u00e9 nes, Algeria. He received a B.S. and Masters degree in organic chemistry from the University of Algiers in 1995 and Tlemcen in 1998, respectively. From there, Mohamed studied at the University of Paris 7 in France and received a Ph.D. in pharmacochemistry in 2002. His doctoral work was centered on the development of PAL 2 inhibitors. He is currently a research assistant in Prof. Roy's laboratory and is actually working on glycomimetics and glycodendrimers as potent FimH inhibitors.",
