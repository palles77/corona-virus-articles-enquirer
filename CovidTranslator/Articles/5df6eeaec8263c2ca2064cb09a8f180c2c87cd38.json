            "text": "Anecdotal reports of respiratory disease (RD) outbreaks in habituated great apes reach back to the 1960s (Lonsdorf et al. 2006) . However, no systematic investigations were performed until much later, when the likely etiology of eight outbreaks in western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus), eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii), and mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) was clarified. These investigations identified two common human viruses, the human respiratory syncytial virus and the human metapneumovirus (HRSV and HMPV; family Paramyxoviridae, subfamily Pneumovirinae), as plausible causative agents (Kaur et al. 2008; K\u00f6ndgen et al. 2008; Palacios et al. 2011) . HRSV and HMPV circulate globally within human populations and are known to cause only mild respiratory symptoms in healthy adults. In infants however, they can lead to severe lower respiratory tract infections with significant mortality (Weber et al. 1998 ). In six outbreaks in wild-habituated great apes, these infections seem to have led to opportunistic coinfections with Streptococcus pneumoniae or Pasteurella multocida (Chi et al. 2007; K\u00f6ndgen et al. 2008 K\u00f6ndgen et al. , 2011 Palacios et al. 2011) . The impact of these outbreaks was often severe, with morbidity and fatality rates as high as 100 and 19%, respectively (K\u00f6ndgen et al. 2008) . Human paramyxoviruses have also been detected during great ape respiratory disease outbreaks in captive settings. In these outbreaks, morbidity and fatality rates reached up to 100 and 10%, respectively, despite treatment (Szentiks et al. 2009; Unwin et al. 2013; Slater et al. 2014) .",

In addition, serological evidence and experimental studies in captive settings show that great apes are susceptible to a number of other human RD-causing pathogens, such as parainfluenza viruses, rhinoviruses, or measles virus (Kalter et al. 1997; Bennett et al. 1998; Kooriyama et al. 2013; Buitendijk et al. 2014) .

Ideally, strong onsite capacities will allow for immediate sample collection and diagnostics of both great apes and neighboring human populations, thereby maximizing the chances of identifying causative agents and possibly therapeutic and preventive options. Here, we report about three RD outbreaks that struck two habituated western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) groups at a research and tourism program in Dzanga Sangha Protected Areas in Central African Republic between March 2012 and November 2014. The second outbreak was investigated with a field laboratory onsite, and analyses were performed while the outbreak was active (real-time investigation). This outbreak occurred simultaneously in humans and one habituated gorilla group in August 2012. Respiratory symptoms in the local human population, including coughing, nasal discharge, sneezing, elevated breathing rate, and wheezing sounds during expiration, occurred before the first symptoms in the gorillas were noted.",

Within the National Parks, human activities such as hunting, gathering, fishing, and agriculture are prohibited and access is strictly regulated. Humans do not permanently live in the park but temporarily stay in one of the several research camps. Tourists are not allowed to stay overnight.

Phylogenetic analyses per se were performed in maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian frameworks. ML analyses were performed using PhyML v3 ; branch robustness was determined by nonparametric bootstrapping (250 pseudoreplicates). Bayesian analyses were run in BEAST v1.8.2 (Drummond et al. 2012 ) under a lognormal-relaxed clock and describing tree shape with a coalescent Bayesian SkyGrid model. Two chains were run for 50 million generations; convergence of the runs and appropriate sampling of the posterior were assessed using Tracer v1.6 (Rambaut et al. 2014) .

From three of the four positive samples, sequences could be generated from the pan-pneumovirus assay (targeting the L protein gene) and were 99% identical with known HRSV A strains (human respiratory syncytial virus isolate Kil-ifi_10028_12_RSVA_2003, partial genome; KP317955.1). All other pathogen tests (as in Table S1 ) were negative. Of the 20 retested human samples, two HRSV positive and all negative samples from the field could be confirmed. Only one sample that tested positive for HRSV in the field could not be confirmed. An additional two human throat swabs (from two camp assistants), from the 60, which had not been tested in the field, came up positive for HRSV.",

Yet, timely onsite diagnostics allow for better disease management, ranging from targeted interventions (e.g., treatments by blow pipe using selected antibiotics as in our Outbreak 1) to management decisions (quarantine or similar for humans). Importantly, this approach also greatly enhances the likelihood of tracing back the origin of a given outbreak. The first simultaneous detection of HRSV in humans and wild-habituated great apes, as described for our outbreak 2, represents compelling evidence of a cross-species transmission from humans. That said, a spillback of the virus into the human population also remains possible. No fatalities occurred in any of the outbreaks. All investigations were performed noninvasively. Successful detection of viruses in great ape feces can vary, however, depending on the viral load excreted, which will change over the time of the outbreak (K\u00f6ndgen et al. 2010 ). Unfortunately, RNA degrades quickly in the environment and successful detection might also be influenced by variables such as food intake. This could explain why additional samples from individuals that tested positive for HRSV during outbreak 2 tested negative.",

For this study, during outbreak 2, throat swabs from humans were taken when the gorillas had already started showing symptoms and not at the exact time when the transmission would have occurred. Thus, the infectious pressure that can be determined from the samples, taken after the onset of the outbreak, does not represent the infectious pressure at the time of presumed transmission. However, the virus was circulating in the human population in the same time period as in the gorilla group, and likely before. This, along with the finding of other respiratory viruses circulating in the human population, also demonstrates the importance of an adequate onsite field laboratory to continuously monitor the health of habituation project staff, the sur-rounding human populations, and potentially any visitors who are brought into close contact with the apes.",

In the described cases, group composition did not change shortly before the outbreaks started and no encounter with other groups was observed. However, once a pathogen enters a group, there are some distinct ape species differences with a marked effect on the potential outcome. In a habituated western lowland gorilla group, habituation success and group stability largely depend on the silverback. In contrast to chimpanzee communities, if the silverback dies during the course of an outbreak the remaining group members will disperse, which can lead to pathogen-mediated dispersal (Nunn et al. 2008 ). This would not only bear considerable economic losses for the habituation project but comes with the risk of infected group members joining other groups and thereby spreading the infection.",

Yet, facemasks had not been included in the prevention program, relying instead on behavioral mechanism such as, if provoked, turning away and coughing or sneezing into clothing, not hands. The use of facemasks, as a preventive measure, is widely recommended (Gilardi et al. 2015) , based on assumptions made from human hygiene and respiratory disease prevention. For influenza viruses, which show similar modes of aerosol transmission as pneumoviruses, wearing of surgical masks can reduce the overall viral copy numbers of exhaled aerosols by 3.4-fold; however, it cannot completely avoid the shedding of infectious virus beyond the mask (Milton et al. 2013) . Commonly used surgical facemasks and N95 respirators have been shown to be equally effective in filtering influenza virus (Johnson et al. 2009 ). Unfortunately, compliance seems to be a major limitation resulting in lower efficacy of face mask use (Radonovich et al. 2009 ). In a hot and humid environment under physical strain, wearing a N95 facemask is uncomfortable and it is unlikely that recommendations will be followed at all times. Due to the incomplete protection through face masks, the additional use of a field lab, which detects virus shedding, and a quarantine system could be an effective asset to existing prevention programs, as it does not rely as much on human compliance-although this would present logistical difficulties for tourism programs. An in-situ field lab could also be used for real-time and onsite diagnostics in other wildlife disease outbreaks, which would allow for timely management decisions. Furthermore it is useful in distinguishing humans infected with (and shedding) a respiratory pathogen from those with, for instance, a noninfectious smoke\u0155s cough. Importantly, 96% (23/24) of the results from the field were confirmed at the Robert Koch-Institute in Germany, which supports the efficacy of a field laboratory.",

However, in addition to small sample size, this analysis is biased, because only infants with respiratory symptoms were sampled. In contrast, only 30 of the 72 adults showed mild respiratory symptoms, of which most can likely be attributed to smoke\u0155s cough. Even though only opportunistic sampling of symptomatic family members was performed, infants were the only individuals with severe respiratory symptoms (including wet cough, sneezing, nasal discharge, wheezing). HRSV is believed to be the most important viral pathogen causing acute lower respiratory disease (ALRI) in young children, with ALRI being the leading cause of global child mortality, with 99% of RSV-caused deaths occurring in developing countries (Nair et al. 2010) . Thus, the contact of project staff and researchers with young children may represent a risk factor for the transmission of pneumoviruses to wild-habituated great apes.

EV are among the most common human viruses, with high rates of subclinical infections (Palacios and Oberste 2005) . Yet, they can be the cause of several, sometimes severe diseases and syndromes, such as acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, myopericarditis, hand-footand-mouth disease, and respiratory disease. Harvala et al. (2014) and Sadeuh-Mba et al. (2014) showed that EV are cocirculating in human and wild great ape populations; some are shared virus types and some genetically divergent EV variants. Unfortunately, studies investigating EV occurrence in wild great apes do not reveal information on the health status of the investigated animals; therefore, it is difficult to determine whether the pathogens had caused any illness. In captive settings, some human EV strains have been shown to cause RD in different nonhuman primates, including great apes (Kelly et al. 1977; Zhang et al. 2011; Nielsen et al. 2012) . In our study, we found EV in both gorillas, and a human. The presence of an EV in the human population or wild great apes, respectively, is per se not surprising. However, the finding of the same virus in a human, and two years later in a gorilla group, is an indicator for yet another transmission, even if the directionality cannot be determined. Unlike HRSV, which is rather unstable in the environment, EV infection can occur, for instance, through contaminated water (Harvala et al. 2014 ). Thus a cocirculation in ape and human populations does not require the same physical proximity. The viruses found are unknown strains, which could be enzootic great ape strains or human EV strains unknown due to underreporting in the region. The fact that the shared EV was detected in the most symptomatic gorilla individuals could point toward its involvement as a causative agent.",
