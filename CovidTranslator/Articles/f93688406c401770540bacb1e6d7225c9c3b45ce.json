The goal of this study was to evaluate the filter performance and facial fit of a sample of surgical masks. Methods: Filter penetration was measured for at least 3 replicates of 9 surgical masks using monodisperse latex sphere aerosols (0.895, 2.0, and 3.1 mm) at 6 L/min and 0.075-mm sodium chloride particles at 84 L/min. Facial fit was measured on 20 subjects for the 5 masks with lowest particle penetration, using both qualitative and quantitative fit tests. Results: Masks typically used in dental settings collected particles with significantly lower efficiency than those typically used in hospital settings. All subjects failed the unassisted qualitative fit test on the first exercise (normal breathing). Eighteen subjects failed the assisted qualitative fit tests; 60% failed on the first exercise. Quantitative fit factors ranged from 2.5 to 9.6.

FDA recommends that manufacturers demonstrate surgical mask performance in 4 areas: fluid resistance, filter efficiency, differential pressure, and flammability. 3 Two types of filter efficiency tests are recommended: (1) particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) using a nonneutralized aerosol of 0.1mm latex spheres at a challenge velocity between 0.5 and 25 cm/s (approximately 8 to 380 L/min for a 9-cm radius mask) 4,5 and (2) bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) using a nonneutralized 3 6 0.3-mm Staphylococcus aureus aerosol and a flow rate of 28.3 L/min. [6] [7] [8] The FDA requires no minimum level of filter performance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes guidelines on the use of surgical masks in health care settings. 9 The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) regulates the testing and certification of respiratory protection equipment. The NIOSH tests filters for the effects of loading (particle burden), temperature, and relative humidity and requires a minimum filtration efficiency of 95%, 99%, or 99.97% using neutralized 0.075-mm count median diameter (CMD) solid aerosols at 85 L/min. 10 Neutralized aerosols are more penetrating than charged ones and yield more consistent results. The CMD represents the median size of the aerosol when it is assessed by number concentration.",

            "text": "For exposures to infectious respiratory organisms, we are most concerned with the size and concentrations of aerosols generated during normal breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing. One study found that particles from healthy subjects ranged from 0.09 to 3 mm particles. Concentrations ranged from 100 to 350 particles/L during normal breathing and 150 to 2000 particles/L during talking or coughing. 19 Another showed concentrations ranging from 14 to greater than 3000 particles/L and an average particle size of 0.32 mm. 20 The filters of most of these surgical masks will allow a large majority of wearer-generated particles to penetrate and will collect only a small percentage of airborne particles generated by infectious patients. Even when equipped with filters demonstrating relatively high collection efficiency, 10% to 40% of particles will penetrate the face seal as a result of poor fit. For aerosols containing organisms with a low infectious dose (eg, tuberculosis), this level of face seal leakage would not prevent a potentially infectious exposure during even a brief encounter with a patient generating copious amounts of aerosol. [21] [22] [23] The poor performance of dental masks is of particular concern, given dental surgeons' close proximity to patients and the high aerosol concentrations generated by dental procedures. 24 A limited number of previous studies of surgical masks as personal protective devices also show that surgical masks are not equivalent to respirators. Two studies simulating inward leakage compared surgical masks sealed and unsealed on a mannequin face and found fit factors from 3 to 5 (18% to 32% face-piece leakage) for 1.8-mm dioctyl phthalate particles and 22-mm fungal spores. 15, 25 A significantly higher prevalence of antibodies for several respiratory tract viruses (influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus) was found in 50 dental surgeons compared with 50 controls. However, no significant difference in antibody prevalence was found between surgeons wearing masks versus those who occasionally or never wore surgical masks. 26 Surgical masks were not effective at reducing internal deposition of Technetium-99 metastable, an aerosolized radiopharmaceutic, in nuclear medicine personnel and did not significantly reduce latex particle inhalation in a study of 20 health care workers. 27,28 A surgical and laser mask showed similar fit factors of 3.0 (95% CI: 1.8-4.2) and 3.8 (95% CI: 2.9-4.6), much less than the fit factor of 102.6 (95% CI: 41.2-164) for a FFP2 respirator. 29 A recent study found a geometric mean fit factor of 2.6 (geometric SD, 1.6) for 6 surgical masks, using a TSI Portacount device with an N95 Companion. 30 There are few studies that compare the clinical efficacy of respirators versus surgical masks. In one Toronto hospital, all attending health care workers reported to be wearing ''respirators'' contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during a patient intubation. 31 Closer examination reveals that employees were wearing surgical masks, not respirators. Another study found that nurses in a Toronto hospital not consistently wearing either a filtering face-piece N95 respirator or a surgical mask had 4 times the risk of contracting SARS as those consistently wearing respirators or surgical masks. 32 Fit testing is not required and was infrequently employed in Canada during the SARS outbreaks. 33 Our data illustrate how important fit is to preventing inward leakage of particles. Qualitative fit tests are considered valid measures of personal protection for respirators that must achieve a fit factor of 100 (used in atmospheres less than 10 times the permissible exposure limit). Although 2 subjects were able to pass the qualitative fit test on 2 different surgical masks when assisted with fit, we believe these results occurred because of temporary taste desensitization. Our quantitative fit test results support this conclusion. None of the test surgical masks attained an individual fit factor of 100, the minimum level expected for a half-mask filtering face-piece respirator. Assistance with fit made no difference in the degree of fit.",

A relatively small number of masks were included, although our selections covered a range of styles and uses to be representative of the variety of commercially available surgical masks. The number of fit test subjects was also small, and no effort was made to obtain a sample representative of the full range of facial shapes. Our data, however, are consistent for all 20 subjects, suggesting that most people will experience similar low levels of fit. Our quantitative fit tests employed a TSI Portacount device without a N95 companion. 11 The latter instrument selects a narrower range of particles to minimize the contribution of filter penetration to the measurement of fit. We sought to minimize this by including in the fit test experiments only surgical masks with filter penetration less than 0.6% at all 3 test particle sizes. In addition, our findings are similar to those of a recent study using the N95 companion. 30 N95 filters must have less than 5% penetration for an aerosol with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 0.3 microns. Half-mask respirators (including those with N95 filters) must have a fit factor (outside/inside particle concentration) of at least 100 to provide the wearer with a protection factor of 10. None of the surgical masks we tested met both of these performance criteria. Although 1 filter showed an average penetration of less than 5% in the NIOSH test, our experiments did not assess the full set of test conditions required for respirator certification. 10 None of the surgical masks we evaluated met the filter or fit performance criteria for respiratory protection devices.",

If health care institutions continue to expend resources on surgical masks for both purposes, we strongly urge the FDA to employ a more robust regulatory approach to their approval.

Our data show that surgical masks do not meet the filtration performance criteria for NIOSH-approved half-mask respirators and that test subjects were not able to pass a fit test as specified by the OSHA. It is therefore recommended that NIOSH-certified respirators, not surgical masks, be used to reduce employee exposure to airborne infectious organisms. NOTE.
