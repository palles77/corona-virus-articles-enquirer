During fasting, activation of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) promotes the utilization of lipids as an energy source. Herein, we show that ligand activation of PPARA directly upregulates the long non-coding RNA gene Gm15441 through binding sites within its promoter. Gm15441 expression suppresses its antisense transcript, encoding thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP). This, in turn, decreases TXNIP-stimulated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 (CASP1) cleavage, and proinflammatory interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) maturation. Gm15441-null mice were developed and shown to be more susceptible to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and to exhibit elevated CASP1 and IL1B cleavage in response to metabolic and inflammatory stimuli. These findings provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which PPARA attenuates hepatic inflammasome activation in response to metabolic stress through lncRNA Gm15441 induction.",

Gm15441 LSL mice were treated with a PPARA agonist or fasted to assess how loss of Gm15441 impacts hepatic inflammasome activation in response to both pharmacological and physiologically-induced metabolic stress. TXNIP protein, caspase-1 (CASP1) levels, and interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) cleavage were elevated in Gm15441 LSL mice and were further increased by PPARA activation, indicating that this lncRNA plays a major role in attenuating inflammasome activation. Thus, hepatic PPARA directly regulates the lncRNA Gm15441, which in turn suppresses Txnip expression, which attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome activation during periods of metabolic stress. These studies revealed a novel regulatory mechanism supporting the beneficial effects of fasting, namely, reduced inflammation.",

For example, lncRNA Blnc1 works in concert with another important hepatic nuclear receptor, liver X receptor (LXR), to activate the lipogenic gene program (Zhao et al., 2018) . Down-regulation of lncRNA lncOb reduces leptin, leading to a leptin responsive form of obesity (Dallner et al., 2019) . Other studies found that lncRNAs are regulated during adipocyte differentiation (Yuan et al., 2019a; Yuan et al., 2019b) , are expressed in liver in a sex-dependent manner when regulated by growth hormone (Melia et al., 2016; Melia and Waxman, 2019) , and can be strongly induced by xenobiotic exposure (Lodato et al., 2017) . A compartment-specific transcriptional profiling approach revealed that lncRNA PAXIP1-AS1 regulates pulmonary arterial hypertension by modulating smooth muscle cell function (Jandl et al., 2019) . Further, lncRNA HOTAIR influences glucose metabolism by upregulation of GLUT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Wei et al., 2017) . It is therefore reasonable to consider that lncRNAs may play important roles in the metabolic remodeling and anti-inflammatory actions that occur after PPARA activation.",

TXNIP acts as a critical relay linking oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to inflammation through NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Anthony and Wek, 2012; Oslowski et al., 2012) .",

Considering these studies, a regulatory mechanism was proposed whereby fatty acids mobilized from adipose tissue during fasting activate PPARA, which in turn suppresses the NLRP3 inflammasome by strong induction of the TXNIP-suppressing lncRNA gene Gm15441, which is antisense to Txnip. ChIPseq datasets were analyzed for PPARA binding sites within the Gm15441 promoter and Gm15441 regulatory elements were confirmed using reporter gene assays and PPARA ChIP studies.",

As lncRNA expression is often highly tissue specific (Iwakiri et al., 2017; Melia et al., 2016; Perron et al., 2017) , the relative basal levels were measured for PPARA-responsive lncRNAs expressed in oxidative tissues that utilize fatty acids as an energy source and express PPARA at the highest levels.

            "text": "A gene targeting strategy was developed to generate a Gm15441 knockout mice without impacting Txnip expression on the opposing strand. To accomplish this goal, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to insert a lox-STOP-lox (LSL) cassette downstream of Gm15441 exon 1 (Figure 4A and B). The LSL cassette prevents transcription of Gm15441 in a Gm15441-floxed mouse but has no effect on transcription of Txnip, which is > 2 kb downstream of the last exon of Txnip. Crossing with a transgenic Cre mouse deletes the LSL cassette and restores Gm15441 expression ( Figure   4C ). All mouse lines were on a pure C57BL/6J background. The genotyping scheme generates an approximately 1200 bp band in Gm15441 wild-type mice (Gm15441 +/+ ) and a 1700 bp band in Gm15441 LSL mice ( Figure 4D ). Basal expression of Gm15441 was significantly lower in livers of Gm15441 LSL when compared to Gm15441 +/+ mice ( Figure 4E ). Expression in heterozygous Gm15441 HET mice was comparable to Gm15441 LSL . To verify the subcellular localization and loss of expression of Gm15441, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) staining was performed on livers from Gm15441 +/+ and Gm15441 LSL mice fed control diet or treated with WY-14643. DAPI staining was used as a counter stain to detect nuclei in liver sections. A pronounced increase in Gm15441 fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm and nuclei of hepatocytes in livers from WY-14643-treated Gm15441 +/+ mice. The Gm15441 RNA signal was absent in livers from vehicle-treated Gm15441 +/+ and Gm15441 LSL mice, and in livers from WY-14643-treated Gm15441 LSL mice ( Figure 4F ). These data validate Gm15441 LSL mice as an effective knockout mouse model and reveal that hepatic Gm15441 expression is both nuclear and cytosolic evoking several possible mechanisms by which it regulates Txnip.",

            "text": "PPARA plays a role in attenuating inflammation in many tissues and disease models (Kono et al., 2009; Schaefer et al., 2008; Yoo et al., 2013; Yoo et al., 2011) . In the liver, PPARA ameliorates inflammation by reducing ER stress in hepatocytes (Zhang et al., 2016) . TXNIP is known to facilitate ER stress-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Anthony and Wek, 2012; Lee et al., 2014b; Lerner et al., 2012; Oslowski et al., 2012) . By regulating TXNIP levels, Gm15441 could serve as a link between PPARA and the NLRP3 inflammasome. To ascertain whether lncRNA Gm15441 attenuates inflammasome activation by regulating TXNIP levels, mice were treated with WY-14643 for 48 hours, and weight loss, liver index, ALT, AST, and serum glucose levels were measured. There was no discernable difference in weight loss between Gm15441 +/+ and Gm15441 LSL mice on a WY-14643 diet ( Figure 5A ). Serum ALT and AST levels were unchanged by genotype or following WY-14643 treatment. Serum glucose levels were significantly decreased by WY-14643 in both Gm15441 +/+ and Gm15441 LSL mice, but the decrease was significantly greater in Gm15441 LSL mice ( Figure 5A ). Furthermore, upon gross liver examination, pronounced hepatomegaly was induced by WY-14643 treatment in both Gm15441 +/+ and Gm15441 LSL mice ( Figure 5B ). Pronounced swelling of hepatocytes was noted in livers of WY-14643-treated Gm15441 +/+ and Gm15441 LSL mice ( Figure 5B) . Expression of the PPARA target genes acyl-CoA dehydrogenase medium chain (Acadm) and Cyp4a14 was significantly increased by WY-14643 in both Gm15441 +/+ and Gm15441 LSL mice. Gm15441 was strongly upregulated in livers of wild-type mice but was not detected in Gm15441 LSL mice. Txnip mRNA was significantly decreased by WY-14643 in livers of wild-type animals, consistent with Figure   2 , but was significantly induced in Gm15441 LSL livers ( Figure 5C ). Basal expression of the inflammasome-related proteins TXNIP, cleaved caspase 1 (CASP1), and cleaved interleukin 1\u03b2 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/675785 doi: bioRxiv preprint (IL1B) was elevated in livers of Gm15441 LSL mice compared to wild-type mice, and significant further increases were seen following WY-14643 treatment (Figure 5D, 5E) . Overall, levels of all three proteins were much higher in livers of WY-14643-treated Gm15441 LSL mice than wild-type mice ( Figure 5E ). Thus, ablation of Gm15441 increases the expression of TXNIP and two other proteins associated with NLRP3 inflammasome activation, namely, cleaved CASP1 and IL1B.",

To determine whether Gm15441 regulates inflammasome activation during physiological fasting, Gm15441 +/+ and Gm15441 LSL mice were fasted for 24 hours. Serum ALT and AST were not changed between Gm15441 +/+ and Gm15441 LSL mice, both with and without WY-14643 treatment ( Figure 6A ). Fasting decreased serum glucose levels in both Gm15441 +/+ and Gm15441 LSL mice, but the decrease was greater in Gm15441 LSL mice ( Figure 6A) . Expression of Acadm, Cyp4a14, and Txnip mRNAs was significantly increased by fasting in both Gm15441 +/+ and Gm15441 LSL mice ( Figure S2A ). Gm15441 was significantly induced by fasting, although to a much lower degree than with WY-14643 treatment ( Figure S2A ). Expression of Txnip mRNA was increased to the same level in livers of fasted Gm15441 LSL mice as in fasted Gm15441 LSL mice ( Figure S2A ). Fasting also increased TXNIP, CASP1, and IL1B protein levels in Gm15441 LSL mice, in contrast to either a modest increase (TXNIP) or no increase (CASP1, IL1B) in Gm15441 +/+ mice ( Figure S2B , Figure   S2C ). Fasting markedly promotes lipid accumulation in mouse liver (Brocker et al., 2018) . Lipid droplet accumulation was also observed and more widespread in fasting Gm15441 LSL mice than fasting Gm15441 +/+ mice ( Figure S2D ).

Fasting induced lower but still significant increases in several of these mRNAs in Gm15441 +/+ livers, which could reflect the fasting-induced increase in Txnip expression ( Figure   S2 ). Thus, Gm15441 negatively regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and lipid accumulation, potentially by preventing Txnip expression, in response to fasting. Txnip translation. To investigate this regulatory mechanism, the translational inhibitory potential of the Txnip 5'UTR was examined when linked to the coding sequence for GFP ( Figure 7A ). The non-5'UTR-GFP and the 5'UTR-GFP expression vectors were each transfected into Hepa-1 cells together with a Gm15441 expression vector or an empty expression plasmid. After 48 hours, strong Gm15441 expression was seen, but had no effect on the RNA levels of GFP or UTR-GFP ( Figure   7B ). In contrast, GFP protein translated from the Txnip 5'UTR-GFP template was significantly reduced in cells co-transfected with Gm15441 expression plasmid ( Figure 7C ). This 5'UTRdependent decrease in GFP protein was most striking when examined by fluorescent microscopy ( Figure 7D and E). These findings suggest Gm15441 may regulate TXNIP translation through IRES sites found within its 5'UTR. To examine whether lncRNA Gm15441 impacts expression of genes that flank Gm15441 on mouse chromosome 3, namely, Hfe2 (Hjv), Pol3gl and Ankrd34a, Hepa-1 cells and NIH3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were transfected with Gm15441 expression vector, or empty plasmid. The Gm15441 transgene was expressed and significantly downregulated Txnip without impacting the expression of Hfe2, Pol3gl, or Ankrd34a ( Figure 7F ).",

            "text": "The physiological alterations that accompany fasting impart several health benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects (Goodpaster and Sparks, 2017; Montagner et al., 2016) . As such, the underlying molecular pathways modulated by caloric restriction may present promising new therapeutic targets. PPARA activation during fasting is a key regulatory event of lipid and glucose metabolism. A growing body of evidence indicates that PPARA activation also potently suppresses inflammation in several disease models and tissues (Abcouwer, 2013; Krysiak et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2007; Tomizawa et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2017) . However, the mechanism by which PPARA modulates metabolic stress-induced inflammation is not known. PPARA is activated by endogenous fatty acid metabolite ligands in response to fasting and promotes the uptake, utilization, and catabolism of fatty acids by regulating a wide range of genes that reprogram metabolic pathways to facilitate the use of lipids as an energy source. The direct regulation of protein-coding genes by PPARA is well characterized, but it was not known whether lncRNAswhich may influence gene expression through a variety of mechanisms (Li et al., 2017b; Militello et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2016) -also serve as direct targets contributing to physiological changes induced by PPARA activation. This possibility was suggested by the finding that several hundred liver-expressed lncRNAs are dysregulated in livers exposed to xenobiotic agonist ligands of the nuclear receptors CAR and PXR (Lodato et al., 2017) , which contribute to the regulation of lipid metabolism and whose gene targets overlap with those of PPARA (Cui and Klaassen, 2016; Wada et al., 2009) . The present study identified several hundred PPARA-responsive liver-expressed lncRNA genes, including anti-sense lncRNAs, which often contribute to the regulation of genes on the opposing strand (Guil and Esteller, 2012; Qu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017a) . Further, a novel PPARA-dependent regulatory axis involving one such anti-sense lncRNA, Gm15441, was characterized. Gm15441 was shown to be transcribed in a liver-specific, PPARA-dependent manner to yield an anti-sense lncRNA that protects against metabolic stress by suppressing PPARA induction of the opposing, sense transcript, TXNIP, and thereby suppresses TXNIPmediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

            "text": "To ascertain whether PPARA regulates lncRNAs, RNA-seq was performed on livers from wild-type and Ppara -/mice treated with the specific PPARA agonist WY-14643. More than 400 liver-expressed lncRNAs, including many novel non-coding RNA transcripts, were significantly upregulated or downregulated in mouse liver 48 hours after WY-14643 treatment. Only six of these lncRNAs were similarly responsive to WY-14643 in Ppara -/mice, thus establishing the striking PPARA dependence of these non-coding RNA transcriptomic responses. PPARAdependent, liver-specific expression was verified for six non-coding RNAs, and detailed functional studies were carried out on one such gene, Gm15441, which showed an unusually strong induction in WY-14643-treated liver. Importantly, the genomic orientation of Gm15441 is antisense to that of Txnip, which codes for a ubiquitously-expressed protein that facilitates cellular responses to oxidative stress and inflammation (Watanabe et al., 2010) . TXNIP was originally identified as a negative regulator of thioredoxin (Muoio, 2007) , and subsequent studies found that TXNIP contributes to a wide array of processes in several tissues. Notably, TXNIP causes an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species generation (Hong et al., 2016) that may inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation (Li et al., 2017a) . TXNIP is key regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which plays an important role in liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Ringelhan et al., 2018; Wree et al., 2017) , and its activation is associated with the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in human diseases (Bai et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019) . TXNIP has also emerged as an important glucose sensor that regulates glucose uptake in response to insulin (Waldhart et al., 2017) and plays an important role in metabolic stress (Mandala et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2013) . Another study found that PPARA activation by fenofibrate downregulated Txnip mRNA and TXNIP protein in endothelial cells (Deng et al., 2017) , suggesting the Gm15441-Txnip regulatory axis described here for liver may also function in extrahepatic tissues. An earlier study found that Ppara mRNA and PPARA target gene mRNAs were elevated in Txnip-null mice, and that Txnip expression attenuated PPRE-luciferase response when co-transfected with PPARA/RXR and treated with WY-14643 (Oka et al., 2009) , suggesting a Txnip-Ppara feedback regulatory loop that may also involve Gm15441.",

Thus, the TXNIP-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome pathway was examined. Txnip mRNA was significantly decreased by PPARA activation in livers of wild-type, Gm15441 +/+ mice, while TXNIP protein was elevated in livers of Gm15441 LSL mice. Furthermore, TXNIP-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation resulted in cleavage of CASP1 to its mature, proteolytically active form. Mature CASP1 subsequently cleaves target proteins including the proinflammatory cytokine IL1B to its corresponding mature, active form. Mature, cleaved CASP1 and IL1B protein were elevated in Gm15441 LSL mice, indicating an increase in inflammasome activation. These findings indicate that lncRNA Gm15441 suppresses the TXNIP-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in response to metabolic stress.",

By binding to these IRES sequences, PTB prevents translation initiation and suppresses TXNIP protein expression. As lncRNA Gm15441 is antisense to TXNIP and its exon 3 almost entirely overlaps the Txnip 5'UTR, Gm15441 may block IRES sequences needed for translation of TXNIP. The ability of Gm15441 to modulate TXNIP protein levels via Txnip 5'UTR IRES sequences was demonstrated in vitro by co-transfection of a GFP reporter with a Gm15441 expression vector. A decrease in GFP expression was dependent on both Gm15441 mRNA and the Txnip 5'UTR sequence, indicating that Gm15441 in part regulates TXNIP by binding to its 5'UTR, presumably by masking functional IRES sites.",

In contrast, previous knockout mouse models developed to evaluate TXNIP function disrupt both Txnip and Gm15441 and therefore abolish the unique regulatory loop that exists between these two genes. Txnip-null mice show a higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, with approximately 40% of male mice developing hepatic tumors (Kwon et al., 2010; Sheth et al., 2006) . However, the Txnip-null mice lack exons 1-4, and thus Gm15441 is also ablated (Oka et al., 2006) . Conditional Txnip-floxed mice were developed that target exon 1, which results in deletion of Gm15441 exon 3 (Oka et al., 2009 ). However, in another study, the ubiquitously-expressed protamine-Cre mouse was employed to generate a Txnip conditional-null mouse line (Yoshioka et al., 2007) . Hepatocytespecific Txnip-null mice also used an exon 1 floxed allele which results in the removal of Gm15441 exon 2 (Chutkow et al., 2008) . TXNIP expression in vitro inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and induced apoptosis (Liu et al., 2017) . Thus, prolonged Gm15441-mediated suppression of TXNIP may contribute to PPARA agonist induced hepatocellular carcinoma (Cho et al., 2019; Gunes et al., 2018) .",

Gm15441 expression was shown to suppress TXNIP protein by a mechanism involving the blocking of IRES sites within its 5'UTR.

IRES sequences are commonly associated with cell survival-and stress response-related genes and utilized when cap-dependent translation is inhibited during nutrient deprivation (Wu et al., 2014). The 5'UTR of Txnip contains multiple binding sites for polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), which regulates IRES-mediated translation (Lampe et al., 2018).

For monitoring the time dependence of gene responses, Wy-14643 was dissolved in 1% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) solution and orally administered (50 mg/kg in 200 \u00b5l) for indicated time points. At the end of the treatment period, the mice were killed by CO 2 asphyxiation and tissues harvested. For physiological studies, food was removed for 24 h starting shortly after the onset of the light cycle and endpoints collected at the same time the following day. Animals were then killed, and tissue samples harvested for further analysis. Blood was collected by venipuncture of the caudal vena cava. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care international guidelines and approved by the National Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use Committee. METHOD DETAILS Generation of Gm15441-null mice SAGE Laboratories (Cambridge, UK) provided design and construction services for the CRISPR/Cas gene targeting technologies used to create a Gm15441-null mouse line. The targeting strategy results in the insertion of a floxed cassette containing a transcriptional stop repeat within the first intron of Gm15441 (NR_040409.1) (Table S3). Presence of the cassette prevents Gm15441 expression. Crossing with a Cre mouse line removes the stop cassette and allows Gm15441 expression to proceed. Microinjection-ready sgRNA, Cas9 mRNA, and a plasmid donor with a floxed stop cassette were purchased from SAGE Laboratories. The sgRNA, Cas9 mRNA, and plasmid donor were then injected into C57BL/6J mouse embryos by the Transgenic Mouse Model Laboratory at the National Cancer Institute (Fredrick, MD) using the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Founder animals were genotyped using primer sets in",
