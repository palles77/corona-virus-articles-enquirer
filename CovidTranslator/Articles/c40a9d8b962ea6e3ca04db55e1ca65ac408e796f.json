            "text": "Background/Purpose: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a newly discovered respiratory pathogen. This prospective hospital-based study investigated the clinical role and features of hMPV in Taiwan. Methods: Respiratory specimens collected from hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection between September 1, 2003 and April 10, 2005 were screened for metapneumovirus using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: During the study period, 930 specimens were obtained from 926 hospitalized children. After exclusion of 200 cases due to lack of clinical evidence of airway infection or diseases with known etiology, 726 were included in the analysis. Among these, 33 children had a positive result for hMPV infection. The majority of these patients were admitted during spring and early summer. Twenty-one (63.6%) were younger than 2 years of age. hMPV accounted for 13.3% of respiratory infections occurring between the ages of 18 and 24 months and was as common a respiratory pathogen as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in that age group. The 11 patients (33.3%) with underlying diseases had a similar disease course to those without underlying diseases. A co-pathogen was found in 11 patients (33.3%). Infected children between 2 and 5 years of age had significantly higher titers of hMPV in their respiratory specimens (10 3.88 copies/\u03bcL) than children younger than 2 years (10 2.26 copies/\u03bcL) (p = 0.013) and children older than 5 years (10 2.25 copies/\u03bcL) (p = 0.005). hMPV positive cases were significantly older than those with RSV infection (p = 0.002) and had a shorter duration of hospitalization (p = 0.001), fewer days of oxygen use (p = 0.001) and higher levels of C-reactive protein (p = 0.004). Conclusion: Metapneumovirus circulates in children in northern Taiwan during spring and early summer. hMPV was the most common respiratory pathogen in children aged between 18 and 24 months hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection. Real-time RT-PCR is a sensitive method for investigating the epidemiology and diseases associated with hMPV. [J Formos Med Assoc 2007;106(1):16-24] ",

Bronchiolitis was defined as an acute respiratory illness characterized by rhinorrhea, cough, and diffuse wheezes and rales, with peribronchial thickening and hyperexpansion on chest radiograph if available. Pneumonia was defined as dyspnea in a patient with focal rales or decreased breath sounds and the presence of a focal infiltrate on chest radiograph. Laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection characterized by hoarseness, cough, and stridor. Two sets of throat swab/NPA samples were obtained for viral culture from children with symptoms/signs of respiratory tract infection. Young infants (age < 3 months) with temperature > 38\u00b0C without a definite source of infection were not excluded for lack of symptoms/signs of respiratory tract infection. One set of the two specimens was promptly inoculated onto cell-culture monolayers. Aliquots of nasopharyngeal aspirates were snap-frozen and stored at \u221270\u00b0C for molecular analysis. The other set of nasopharyngeal aspirate was tested by direct immunofluorescence assay to detect human RSV (IMAGEN\u2122 Respiratory Syncytial Virus; DakoCytomation, Cambridgeshire, UK), parainfluenza viruses type 1 and 3 (IMA-GEN\u2122 Parainfluenza Virus; DakoCytomation), or indirect immunofluorescence assay of antigen detection to detect Chlamydia pneumoniae antigen (TWAR) (DakoCytomation). Serology of mycoplasma was performed for patients who presented with atypical pneumonia (good activity, no respiratory distress, with/without pneumonia patch). Positive IgM titer (IgM-specific ELISA, SeroMP IgM; Savyon, Ashdod, Israel) or a four-fold rise of complement fixation titer (Virion, Nurzburg, Germany) in convalescent serum compared with acute serum (1-2 weeks apart) or titer 1:64 for single acute serum were defined as positive.

Real-time RT-PCR was applied to detect viral RNA using a single tube RT-PCR kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (RNA master hybridization probes; Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Amplification and detection of RNA were performed with a Lightcycler 2.0 instrument (Roche Applied Science) with one-step RT-PCR. Each capillary glass contained a 10 \u03bcL reaction mixture that included 2.6 \u03bcL sample RNA, 3.75 \u03bcL of an enzyme mixture and a reaction buffer (Lightcycler RNA master mix hybridization probes; Roche Applied Science), 0.5 \u03bcM sense primer, 0.5 \u03bcM antisense primer, 3.25 mM Mn [Oac] 2 , and 0.2 \u03bcM fluorescein hybridization probes (TIB-MOLBIOL, Berlin, Germany). The primers used in the initial test of the respiratory specimens were based on the sequence data of a Dutch strain available from GenBank (accession no. AF 371367) and targeted the hMPV N gene. 2 The sense primer, 5'-AACCGTGTACTAAGTGATGCACTC and the antisense primer, 5'-CATTGTTTGACCGGCCCCATAA, produce an amplicon that corresponds to nucleotides 601-813 of the hMPV N gene. Homology between hMPV and RSV RNA genome is only 20%, 1 hence, it is sufficiently distinct that its sequences do not cross-react with existing nucleic acid amplification assays. Each set of RT and PCR reactions contained appropriate negative controls. The reaction mixtures were exposed to a 20-minute 61\u00b0C RT step, 30 seconds of denaturation at 95\u00b0C, and followed by 55 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1 second, 60\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 72\u00b0C for 13 seconds, using a channel setting of F2/F1.

Even after extensive laboratory investigations, about half of ARTIs have no identifiable etiologic agent. 9,10 hMPV is a newly discovered viral pathogen and its clinical epidemiology and impact have yet to be fully defined. This virus has been shown to be circulating in many Asian and Western countries. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [11] [12] [13] The present study found that 4.6% of children hospitalized due to ARTIs at a medical center in northern Taiwan were infected with hMPV. This rate is similar to what has been reported in other countries, including 3.9% in the United States, 13 5.5% in Hong Kong, 12 and 6.2% in Italy. 10, 11 Real-time PCR has become an important tool in the study of infectious diseases, especially for a newly identified virus that is difficult to grow in cell culture. A study by Mackay et al showed that real-time RT-PCR improved the detection of virus compared with conventional RT-PCR. 2 Although identification of viral nucleic acid in respiratory specimens does not prove that hMPV is responsible for patients' illnesses, the association between respiratory tract illness and presence of the virus suggests a causative role. 13 Furthermore, hMPV does not appear to be associated with asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx since no hMPV was found in respiratory samples from asymptomatic children < 2 years old. 1 In addition to its improved sensitivity and specificity, RT-PCR specific for the N gene has been shown to be more sensitive than RT-PCR for genes L, F, M and P of hMPV. 9, 14 The seasonal occurrence of hMPV infection largely overlaps with that of RSV infections. hMPV is considered to be a pathogen from December till May in North America and the United Kingdom. 3, 8, 15 In the present study, hMPV infection peaked in late spring and early summer. Similar seasonal patterns have been observed in Hong Kong, Canada and Japan. 12, 16, 17 A study from Tennessee noted that infections began in March and peaked in May, with some disease activity in June and September, which was quite similar to our results. 18 In the present study, sporadic hMPV infection also occurred outside of the peak seasons during the 20-month study period. Possible reasons for the seasonal pattern may include multiple circulating strains of hMPV, climate change, and demographic factors. Phylogenetic study and long-term prospective study are needed to clarify the responsible factors. 10 Previous studies showed that co-infection of RSV or other respiratory pathogens with hMPV occurred in 10-75% of subjects. 10, [19] [20] [21] Co-infecting viral agents found in hMPV-infected symptomatic individuals include adenovirus, RSV, influenzae A and B, and measles. 5, 22 Among these, dual infections with hMPV and RSV seem to increase disease severity. 19, 20 In this study, one-third of the hMPV-infected cases had other pathogens identified during the episode of ARTIs. There was no significant difference in severity of infection, however, between patients with dual infections and single hMPV infection. Furthermore, the viral titers of hMPV in specimens from patients with single infection were equal to those of patients with dual infection. We could not confirm whether dual infection with hMPV and RSV is more severe because there was only one such case in our cohort. Nevertheless, comparison of characteristics between patients with single RSV and hMPV infections showed that RSV infected younger children, led to a more prolonged hospitalized course and higher oxygen demand.",
