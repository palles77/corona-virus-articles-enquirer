In contrast, the 2F4 monoclonM antibodies, although specific for the N protein, did not show any complement mediated neutralization in vitro or protective activity in vivo and did not react with infected cell plasma membranes. An anti-N protein monoclonal antibody without in vitro neutralizing activity against MHV-2, that could confer protection in MHV-2-infeeted mice, has been reported previously [9] . On the other hand, monoclonal antibody against the N protein of M H V -J H M (MHV-4), like our 2F4 monoelonal antibodies, did not have any protective activity against a lethal dose of virus [2] . It can be assumed that the 1E7A4H1 and 2F4 monoclonal antibodies are reacting against different epitopes, which would also explain the different patterns of cross-rcaetivities shown b y E L I S A with MHV-A59 and MHV-4. Obviously because of the small number of monoclonal antibodies in this series exhibiting different patterns of reaction it is not possible to analyse virus structures in relation to protection mechanisms, as has been done for other MHVs [2, 11, 12, 17] . However, the present s t u d y demonstrates that at least one epitope on the N protein is accessible to antibodies on the surface of infected cells. This has not yet been shown for MHVs b u t it has been shown for the N protein of influenza virus [18] . It can be envisaged that although an anti-N protein monoclonM antibody cannot prevent adsorption of the virus to initiate a first cycle of replication, it could confer protection by reacting with the surface of infected cells causing antibody-dependent complement or cell-mediated cytolysis, as has been shown for various virus infections [6, 10] .",

The antigen-antibody reaction on nitrocellulose strips was revealed with a rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase diluted 1/400 (Miles Laboratories)(Fig. 2B). The intensity of fluorescence was comparable to that of a polyclonal mouse anti-MHV-3 serum and no reaction was observed with the monoelonal antibodies of the 2F4 series or an irrelevant anti-herpes monoclonal antibody (data not shown). Both cultures supernatants and aseitic fluids were tested for virus neutralization in vitro as well as in vivo. For in vitro neutralization, hybridoma supernatants were mixed with virus di]utions. To the antibody-virus mixture was added guinea-pig complement diluted 1 : 10 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. This mixture was then plated in quadruplicateFig. 2.
