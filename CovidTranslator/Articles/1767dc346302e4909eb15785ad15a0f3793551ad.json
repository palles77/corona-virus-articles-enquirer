In this study, we have used the fusogenic core as a scaffold to design HIV-1 fusion inhibitory proteins by linking another HR1 to the C terminus of HR1-HR2 (HR121) or additional HR2 to the N terminus of HR1-HR2 (HR212). Both recombinant proteins could be abundantly and solubly expressed and easily purified, exhibiting high stability and potent inhibitory activity on HIV-1 fusion with IC 50 values of 16.2 \u00b1 2.8 and 2.8 \u00b1 0.63 nM, respectively.

            "text": "The fusion and entry of the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) are mediated by its envelope (env) glycoprotein [1] . The env protein is synthesized as a precursor polypeptide gp160 which is then proteolytically cleaved into two non-covalently attached proteins, gp120 and gp41 [1] . Gp120 is responsible for binding to cellular receptors, CD4 and certain chemokine co-receptors, while gp41 possesses membrane fusion activity. The N terminus of gp41 contains a hydrophobic fusion peptide, followed by two well-conserved heptad-repeat regions 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2). HR1 and HR2 play a crucial role in membrane fusion. Upon gp120 binding to cellular receptors, gp41 undergoes a series of conformational changes to convert from a native, non-fusogenic conformation to fusogenic conformation [2] . The fusogenic core of gp41 is a trimer-of-hairpins structure (a six-helix bundle) in which three HR2 helices pack against a central trimeric coiled-coil formed by three HR1 helices [3, 4] . Formation of the trimer-of-hairpins brings the viral and cellular membranes into the close proximity necessary for membrane fusion to occur. During the fusion process, the native gp41 converts to a transiently populated prehairpin intermediate prior to formation of the fusogenic trimer-of-hairpins structure when the fusion peptide of gp41 is inserted into the target cell membrane, and both HR1 and HR2 are transiently accessible to inhibitory compounds [5] . Peptides derived from HR1 and HR2 regions can inhibit gp41-mediated membrane fusion by binding to the prehairpin intermediate to block the proper formation of the trimer-of-hairpins, thus preventing membrane fusion [6, 7] . Recombinant proteins that contain the HR1 and HR2 segments of HIV-1 gp41 separated by a short, hydrophilic, six-residue linker (HR1-HR2) have been produced and shown to fold into thermally stable six-helix bundles [8] . Based on these, we design two proteins: HR121, in which one HR1 (N34) peptide is linked to the C terminus of HR1-HR2 (HR1-HR2-HR1), and HR212, in which one HR2 (C34) peptide is linked to the N terminus of HR1-HR2 (HR2-HR1-HR2). The rationale for this design is that three heptad-repeats (two HR1 and one HR2 or one HR1 and two HR2) are linked by flexible linkers so that HR1 and HR2 in each protein can associate to form a hairpin structure. As a consequence, three molecules of the proteins can form a stable six-helix bundle with three free heptad-repeats (HR1 or HR2) exposed (Fig. 1 ). These free HR1 or HR2 can bind to the counterpart regions in the viral gp41, thereby blocking gp41-mediated membrane fusion. Here, we showed that HR121 and HR212 were well expressed as soluble proteins and could be easily purified. The two proteins inhibited HIV-1 membrane fusion in nanomolar concentrations.",

            "text": "Peptides derived from HR2 region of gp41 are potent inhibitors of HIV-1 entry, with IC 50 values in the low nanomolar range. One of these peptides, T-20 (brand name: Fuzeon; generic name: Enfuvirtide) [11] , has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Commission for treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and children who have failed to respond to the current antiretroviral drugs. The inhibitory activity of T-20 provides compelling evidence that the prehairpin intermediate is a useful target for anti-HIV-1 therapy. However, although T-20 is effective in blocking in vitro HIV-1 infection at nanomolar level, large amounts of this peptidic drug (about 200 mg/day) are required to maintain the in vivo anti-HIV-1 efficacy in humans. Therefore, treatment with T-20 is priced about $20,000 and $25,000 per patient per year in the United States and Europe, respectively. One of the major limitations of T-20 is the difficulty of peptide synthesis, resulting in high cost of production and insufficiency of supplies [12] . Peptides derived from HR1 region of gp41, which are thought to either bind to the HR2 region of the prehairpin intermediate or hinder the formation of the internal trimeric coiled-coil [13, 14] , possess anti-HIV-1 activity about three orders of magnitude lower than those of HR2 peptides, presumably because of aggregation and their inability to form the trimeric coiled-coil in the absence of HR2 peptides [15] . There-fore, it is necessary to design a new class of molecules targeting HR1 or HR2 of the viral gp41 with potent anti-HIV-1 activity, high stabilities, and low cost of production.",

Lu also showed that the linker in N34-L6-C28 stabilized the folded gp41 core for entropic reasons, without perturbing its structure [3] . Based on these, we made use of the fusogenic core as a scaffold to link another HR1 to its C terminus and additional HR2 to its N terminus to design two proteins denoted HR121 (N34-linker-C34-linker-N34) and HR212 (C34-linker-N34-linker-C34), respectively, which were constructed by N34 and C34 (residues 628-661). C34 peptide is extended six residues from the C-terminal sequence of the C28 segment in N34-L6-C28. We selected C34 segment not C28 segment mainly because C34 peptide inhibited HIV-1 entry with the lowest IC 50 values of 2-5 nM [14] .",

HR121 sustains the HR1 peptide coiled-coil conformation and, strikingly, it has dramatically increased antiviral potency over the corresponding HR1 peptides, which have a tendency to aggregate. The inhibitory activity of HR121 is comparable with those of 5-Helix, Nccg-gp41, IQN17, and IQN23 [14, [16] [17] [18] . 5-Helix (HR1-HR2-HR1-HR2-HR1), five of six helices that constitute the gp41 trimer-of-hairpins, is linked covalently into a single polypeptide. 5-Helix lacks a third HR2 segment and this vacancy creates a high-affinity binding site for HR2 peptides. 5-Helix is a potent and broad-spectrum inhibitor of HIV-1 membrane fusion, with IC 50 values in the low nanomolar range. However, 5-Helix is expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies that results in difficulties to purify it. Nccg-gp41 (HR1-HR1-HR2), which is constructed by grafting one HR1 to N terminus of N34-L6-C28 core, inhibits membrane fusion at nanomolar concentration. But it is also extracted from inclusion bodies. Both IQN17 and IQN23 are synthesized, which is at high cost. Compared with these inhibitors targeting the HR2 region of the prehairpin intermediate of gp41, HR121 is expressed in E. coli as soluble proteins and can be easily purified. On the other hand, the inhibitory activity of HR121 further tests the hypothesis that the weak inhibition of HR1 peptide results from their tendency to aggregate in the absence of HR2 peptide. HR212, in which three C34 peptides are stabilized by linking them to a six-helix bundle of gp41, is also a highly potent inhibitor of HIV-1 env glycoprotein-mediated cell fusion. Its inhibitory activity is comparable to that of T20, but the stability of HR212 is improved with the production at low cost. This design has already been applied to SARS-CoV. Both HR121 and HR212 inhibit HIV/SARS pseudotyped viruses entry in micromolar range [19] .",
