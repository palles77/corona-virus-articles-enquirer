Langerhan's cells in the skin . Usually, but not invariably, class I molecules are the MHC recognition molecules for CD8 + T cells (suppressor/cytotoxic) whereas class II molecules are recognized by CD4 + T cells (helper/inducer) . The process of T cell recognition of antigen in the context of MHC molecules is a central means whereby an individual distinguishes self from non-self . Lack of class II MHC expression, as occurs in type II bare lymphocyte syndrome, results in severe immunodeficiency . At the other extreme, aberrant expression on normally class II-negative cells carries the risk of inappropriate presentation of self-antigens and is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases . Furthermore, individual susceptibility to a variety of autoimmune diseases in humans has been reported to be influenced by the genetically-determined MHC repertoire, particularly those of the class II MHC region . ' The CNS has traditionally been considered a relatively immunologically privileged site, partly because neural cells were thought not to express MHC antigens, based primarily on early immuno-histochemical analyses of normal tissue in situ . 2 ' 3 The selective advantage to the organism for such non-expression remains unexplained . Expression in human CNS of MHC antigens, both class I and class II, appears under pathological conditions, including not only those considered primarily inflammatory disorders 4 ' 5 but also in neurodegenerative diseases where the pathogenesis is not thought to be immunemediated . 6 ' 7 Central issues raised by these observations include which CNS cells can be induced to express MHC molecules ; what conditions regulate this expression ; and what is the functional significance of such expression with regard to regulation of immune reactivity within the CNS and to endogenous CNS cells becoming susceptible targets of T cell-mediated immune effector mechanisms .",

The cell types expressing class II MHC molecules have been variably identified (either by morphology, ultrastructural features and/or immunohistochemistry) as astrocytes8 or microglial cells ;7 ' 9 oligodendrocytes and neurons have consistently been found to be negative for class II MHC antigen expression in situ . 5\u00b010 The majority of examinations continue to report lack of expression of class I MHC molecules in normal neural tissue . 4, 5, 11 Although the detection of MHC molecules in normal human brain tissue sections remains equivocal, there is agreement that MHC expression is up-regulated (increased intensity of immunoreactivity and in proportion of immunoreactive cells) in many disease states . These include multiple sclerosis, where inflammatory processes are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis, 4 ' 5 and in conditions where no classical inflammation is apparent, such as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and brain tumors .

The choice of fixative (paraformaldehyde or Bouin's being preferred) and the duration of fixation have recently been highlighted as important determinants when assessing MHC expression in situ . 7 Class II MHC immunoreactivity can best be detected with fixation intervals of less than 5 h ; staining intensity steadily declined with prolonged fixation until after 10 h, little or no immunoreactivity was observed . Under the presumed optimal staining conditions, only microglia expressed class II MHC in the normal human brain .",

Antel human brain sections, normal rodent brains in situ do not show immunoreactivity for MHC except on scattered endothelial cells of large blood vessels . Whereas class II MHC-positive astrocytes and microglia are observed in active lesions in multiple sclerosis, astrocytes in the lesions of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis, do not appear to express class II MHC (Ia) while microglia do ; 12-14 astrocytes and microglia are both class I MHC immunoreactive in EAE. In Wallerian degeneration following eye enucleation or facial nerve resection, microglia but not astrocytes express la antigens ;15, is following facial nerve resection microglia are also immunoreactive for class I MHC . 17 The majority of rat CNS cells newly induced to express MHC class II following 3 days of continuous intravenous administration of gamma-interferon, which is a potent inducer of class II antigens on astrocytes in vitro (see below), were found to be microglia and not astrocytes . 18 Normal mouse oligodendrocytes in situ have been reported to express class Ia, 19 although this was not confirmed by others . 18 One immunoelectron microscopic study20 has described cytoplasmic reactivity for class la in a small proportion In view of the many potential difficulties of experiments in vivo, cultured cells have been used to address the issue of expression of MHC on neural cells . Here, live cells can be subjected to immunohistochemical protocols without prior fixation, and the cell type of interest can be reliably identified by using cell typespecific antibodies in double immunofluorescence analyses. Bulk isolated cultures also allow for more detailed analyses using molecular biology tools . By immunohistochemical analyses largely performed using cells cultured from neonatal animals, the consensus for rodent cells is that under basal culture conditions class I MHC antigens are expressed on a substantial number of astrocytes 21,22 and microglial cells 23 but not oligodendrocytes . 22, 25 Class I can be induced on rodent oligodendrocytes by viral infections and gamma-interferon . 24,25 Immunoreactive expression of class II MHC (Ia) on rodent astrocytes, microglia or oligodendrocytes in basal culture conditons appears to be absent or negligible . 21,26-30 Analyses at the messenger RNA level similarly reveal that cultured astrocytes do not constitutively express mRNA for class II MHC . 31 Induction of la on rodent astrocytes occurs after treatment with gamma-interferon, 26,27,29,32 tumor necrosis factor33 and certain strains of viruses . 29 The administration of gamma interferon in vivo results in the detectable expression of la antigens on rodent astrocytes when isolated and cultured, even when none are detected in vivo . 27 Similarly, gammainterferon treatment of mouse or rat microglia in vitro results in la expression ;23,30 neonatal or adult brainderived microglia respond in a similar manner . 23 The gamma-interferon-induced la expression on glial cells seems to be mediated by the protein kinase C signal transduction pathway . 34 In contrast to astrocytes and microglia, rodent oligodendrocytes appear refractory to la expression even when stimulated with gamma-interferon, or supernatants derived from activated mononuclear cells or virus-infected cells . 25,26 It is of interest to note that the O-2A progenitor cell (which gives rise to the type-2 astrocytes and oligodendrocytes at least in vitro) and the type-2 astrocytes can be induced by V. W. Yong and J. P. Antel gamma-interferon to express la ; oligodendrocytes are refractory . 35 These authors suggest that differentiation of the O-2A progenitor cells along the oligodendrocyte pathway is associated with a loss of inducibility of Ia antigens .",

Their young age group (25 \u00b1 3 years) corresponds to one that is at risk for developing suspected autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis . For class I MHC molecules, close to 100% of oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia were immunoreactive . 42 _ 45 For HLA-DR, virtually all microglia showed positivity ; no oligodendrocytes were found to express HLA-DR (Figure 1 ) . The analyses of HLA-DR expression on biopsy-derived adult human astrocytes showed that this class II MHC molecule was detected on all 15 human biopsy-derived cultures ; however, different series of human astrocytes expressed HLA-DR bearing astrocytes remained relatively constant when analysed at different time points, up to 125 days in vitro . 45 The differential level of expression of HLA-DR between human series was not correlated with the age of the human subjects, the extent of gliosis in the resected material or the duration for which the cells have been maintained in culture . When adult human astrocytes were subclassified by morphology (these did not fall neatly into the type-1 and type-2 astrocytes characterized in rodent), HLA-DR expression was prevalent on process-bearing rather than the flat astrocytes (Figure 1) , 44 The expression of HLA-DR on cultured adult human glial cells in our studies probably represents an induction process in vitro, because freshly isolated cells did not have detectable HLA-DR and because the type of serum (example, human AB) and its concentration in the culture medium affected the proportion of astrocytes that expressed HLA-DR . 45 It would be of interest to determine whether the individual variability of HLA-DR expression on human astrocytes reflects a genetically determined property, as seems to be the case with rodents where inducibility of Ia molecules on cultured astrocytes correlates with susceptibility to EAE (see below) .",

Although one explanation may be the feasibility of determinations in vitro, it is more likely that the induction of MHC molecules is a result of cell culture . Another possibility is that in culture as yet uncharacterized in situ inhibitors of MHC antigen expression are lost . Class II MHC expression on astrocytes and microglia in the human system is observed under baseline culture conditions, unlike in rodent cells (Table 1) ; we speculate that the molecular factors that control inducible elements of MHC gene expression in the human system are less tightly regulated than those in rodent cells . However, in response to treatment with gamma-interferon, a potent cytokine, induction of MHC seems to be similar across species (Table 1) . There does not appear to be changes in MHC expression due to age factors, from the limited number of studies currently available, 23 , 48, 49 Significance of MHC expression by glial cells Antigen presentation Neonatal murine astrocytes and microglia, especially after gamma-interferon treatment, can present antigen, e .g. myelin basic protein, to previously sensitized CD4+ T cell lines in an MHC class IIrestricted manner . 22,30,50,51 Astrocytes, even after treatment with gamma-interferon, are, however, unable to induce activation of primary CD4 + T cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction ; 52 such responses were achieved by `professional' antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and activated B cells . Microglial cells prepared from human brain biopsies are also able to induce a response by previously nonactivated human peripheral blood-derived T cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction . The capacity of endogenous glial cells to present antigen probably contributes to the observed persistence of activated myelin-sensitized T cells within the CNS, as compared to non-neural antigen-reactive T cells .",

The increasing availability of molecular genetic techniques to manipulate expression of MHC per se within the CNS provides new opportunities to assess the role of these molecules in influencing neural-immune interactions .

It still has to be defined whether down-regulation of MHC can be more readily achieved on CNS cells with their inducible rather than constitutive expression of MHC, than on systemic antigen-presenting cells that constitutively express them .
