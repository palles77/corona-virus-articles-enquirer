To assess the efficacy and safety of a low-dose recombinant human interferon \u2423-2b (rIFN\u2423-2b) nasal spray in preventing acute viral respiratory infections in military population, we performed this randomized controlled trial. The results showed that application of the rIFN\u2423-2b nasal spray had the benefits in prevention of infections caused by influenza A virus, influenza B virus parainfluenza viruses 1-3 and adenovirus species B. However, no benefit was seen in preventing respiratory syncytial virus. No severe adverse events were reported. Therefore, the rIFN\u2423-2b nasal spray was effective and well tolerated for preventing common viral respiratory infections in the military recruits.",

Military recruits are prone to outbreaks of acute respiratory tract infections because of their crowded living conditions in barracks, stressful work environments, frequent travels and exposure to novel strains of respiratory pathogens [1] [2] [3] . Over 90% of acute respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses, such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus and coronavirus. Though most of viral respiratory infections usually represent mild, selflimited clinical manifestations, they are leading causes of morbidity in certain groups or populations (e.g., children, military population) and remain a heavy burden of disease [4, 5] . In history, the famous \"Spanish influenza\" initiated from army recruits in 1916 [6] . In 1976, the novel A/New Jersey/76 (Hsw1N1) influenza virus caused severe respiratory illness in soldiers at Fort Dix [1] . Adenoviruses have been the most important cause of febrile acute respiratory disease in US military recruit populations [7] . In China, a comprehensive surveillance systems for influenza in military population showed that the average incidence of influenza was 1.4 episode per person-year from 1995 to 2000 [8] . Viral respiratory infections have become one of the most actual health problems in military population. Therefore, it is necessary to seek reasonable and effective measures to prevent outbreaks and epidemics of acute viral respiratory infections among military population.",

However, the major problem is higher frequency of local side effects such as mucosal irritation, dry mucous membranes, blood-tinged mucus and nasal mucosal erosion [15] [16] [17] . Recently, YUANCE Medicine Company (Beijing, China) has developed a low-dose recombinant human interferon \u2423-2b (rIFN\u2423-2b) nasal spray in order to reduce adverse reactions.

Candidate subjects were male recruits who aged 16-23 years, and finished army physical fitness examination. They were not admitted to the study if any of the following criteria were present: (1) on regular medical treatment or took other medications within two weeks, (2) history of serious allergies (e.g., asthma, urticaria, and eczema), (3) history of autoimmune disorders, (4) psychiatric disorders, and (5) acute or chronic illnesses. All candidates were observed two weeks before enrolling into the study, in order to screen eligible subjects. A total of 1500 trainees from three areas enrolled the trial initially. After the screening had been completed, 1449 eligible recruits remained in the subject pool. All participants understood the implications of the study, and provided informed consents.",

Although isolation of virus from patients is the strongest evidence for confirming viral respiratory infections, the diagnostic procedures are complex and time-consuming because of the wide range of viruses, especially in a large sample epidemiological study. In addition, respiratory viruses are frequently detected in respiratory tract secretions samples from healthy people [26, 27] . The determinations antibodies against respiratory viruses by comparing acute and convalescent serum specimens in infective people may sometimes be helpful to confirm a specific causative infection. Serum specific IgM against virus is a sensitive indicator of a recent onset of viral infection, thus, we used specific serum IgM as surrogate outcome variables to evaluate the preventive effects of the rIFN-\u2423 2b for acute viral respiratory infections in this study.",

            "text": "The RR, RRR and ARR are common parameters used in reporting randomized clinical trials and epidemiological field trails. The RR is a ratio of the probability of the event rate occurring in the exposed (or experimental) group (EER) versus a non-exposed (or control) group (CER). In interventional trials, if the treatment arm is effective in preventing disease then the RR will be less than one, and vice versa. The RRR is the percent reduction in events in the EER compared with the CER. In other word, the RRR presents the percentage of the risk that has been reduced by the intervention in the control group. The ARR is the arithmetic difference in the event rate between treatment group and control group. In interventional trials, if the treatment arm is effective in preventing disease then ARR will be positive quantity, on the contrary, if the treatment arm is harm, ARR will be negative. RR and RRR can be used to quantify the relative magnitude of the protective (treatment) effects. The ARR can be used to measure the absolute difference in event rates between two populations. Therefore, ARR is considered as a more intuitive measure than RR and RRR. These years, the number needed to treat (NNT) has become a widely used index for interpreting the magnitude of treatment benefits or harms. The NNT is the inverse of the ARR. It represents the expected number of persons who must be treated with an intervention in order to prevent one additional adverse outcome event (or, depending on the context, to expect one additional beneficial outcome), compared to the expected event rates under the control. That is to say, the smaller the NNT, the more effective the treatment. Therefore, besides RR, RRR and ARR, we used the NNT to express the size of efficacy of the rIFN\u2423-2b in the present analysis.",

In ITT analysis, highly antiviral effects for Flu-A, Flu-B and PIV1-3 were seen, all with the RR of <1 and the RRR (i.e., protective rates) of >70%. A protective effect also was seen for ADV, with the RR of <1 and the RRR of 59.5%. However, there were wide range of 95% confidence intervals of the RR (0.165-0.999) and RRR (0.6-83.5%), which indicated the low reliability. No certain effect was found for RSV. Although the RR was less than 1 and RRR = 72.1%, the 95% CI ranges of RR (0.057-1.356) and RRR (\u221235.6% to 94.3%) were very wide and included null values (RR 95% CI included 1, RRR 95% CI included negative). Because of small size samples for detecting serum ADV antibodies and RSV antibodies and less people of anti-ADV and anti-RSV IgM positive in both groups and a very wide confidence interval of protection rates in ADV and RSV, we considered that the sample of this study was not enough for assessing preventive effects of the rIFN-\u24232b for these two viruses.",

Except epistaxis, no other known severe adverse events (such as allergy, high fever, nasal mucosa erosion and hemafecia) of the intranasal interferon were reported during the trial. The RRs of dry pharynx and epistaxis were 1.70 (95% CI: 1.39-2.08) and 1.85 (95% CI: 1.06-3.23), respectively, which indicated that dry pharynx and epistaxis might be linked to the interferon. However, the incidence of epistaxis was low and the clinical signs were mild and transitory in present study. The results are the same as our previous study [28] and the risk is much lower than that appraised and summarized in evidence-based medicine (OR = 4.52, 95% CI = 3.78-5.41) by Jefferson and Tyrrell [29] .",

However, the limitations of this trial may be found on sampling and sample size. All subjects enrolled were healthy and young male recruits, so it may be difficult to extrapolate the conclusion to other populations. The sample was not large enough for evaluating the effects for ADV and RSV infections which had relative low incidence in the army recruits. The efficacy of preventing viral respiratory infections by the rIFN\u2423-2b nasal spray should be evaluated further in different population groups, such as children and the elderly, and more samples should be involved in the further study.",
