Day-old chicks were separated into three groups, (I) vaccinated with H120 at day-old followed by CR88 at 14 days-old, (II) vaccinated with H120 and CR88 simultaneously at day-old and again with CR88 at 14 days-old, (III) control unvaccinated. At 30 days-old, each of the groups was challenged with virulent IS/885 or IS/1494. Protection was evaluated based on the clinical signs, tracheal and kidney gross lesions and tracheal ciliostasis. Results showed that administering combined live H120 and CR88 vaccines simultaneously at day-old followed by CR88 vaccine at 14 days-old gave more than 80 per cent tracheal ciliary protection from both of the Middle East isolates. In addition, this programme conferred 100 per cent protection from clinical signs and tracheal or kidney lesions. The other vaccination programme, H120 at day-old followed by CR88 at 14 days-old, the tracheal ciliary protection conferred were 60 per cent and 80 per cent from IS/885/00-like and IS/1494/06like, respectively.

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a ubiquitous virus with high mutation, and a large number of serotypes or genotypes of IBV strains have been reported worldwide (de Wit and others 2011). Variant strains emerge due to changes in the IBV genome through point mutations, deletions, insertions or RNA recombination and these variants are often responsible for IB outbreaks in vaccinated chicken flocks (Cavanagh and others 1988 IS/885/00 and IS/1494/06 or those with high similarities to these strains of IBVs have been reported throughout the Middle East and North Africa (Meir and others 2004) , Iraq (Mahmood and others 2011) , Egypt (Abdel-Moneim and others 2012), Turkey (Kahya and others 2013) and Libya (Awad and others 2014a) . In most cases, severe respiratory distress and renal lesions with high mortality were observed in vaccinated flocks affected by these strains. It appears that the conventional H120 vaccines alone do not provide sufficient protection from these strains (Meir and others 2004, Kahya and others 2013) . However, development of vaccines against each of these new variants is not generally an option due to the high cost and time required for product registration (Jackwood and others 2003, Bijlenga and others 2004) . Furthermore, it could be a never-ending race as new variant IBVs are constantly emerging in major poultry producing countries. Instead, it has been recommended that protection conferred by available live IBV vaccines against new variants should be constantly evaluated (Alvarado and others 2003) . Vaccination with one serotype does not ensure complete protection from heterologous strains (Cook and others 1999) but the use of different combinations of live IBV vaccines has been shown to be able to induce high and broad protection from challenges with several heterologous virulent IBV variants (Gelb and others 1991 , Cook and others 1999 , Cook and others 2001 , Alvarado and others 2003 , Martin and others 2007 , Terregino and others 2008 .",

Both viruses had been isolated from a recent outbreak of high mortality and respiratory disease in broiler flocks in Egypt. The isolates were submitted to the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, Padova, Italy as third passage allantoic fluid. At this laboratory, the allantoic fluid was screened against avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus and IBV. It was negative for avian influenza virus and Newcastle disease virus but positive for IBV. At the University of Liverpool, the IS/885 strain was identified by reverse transcriptase-PCR and part-S1 sequence analysis showed 90 per cent nucleotide level identity to the Israeli strain IS/885/00 (Meir and others 2004) .

At one day of age, Group I was inoculated with H120 vaccine. Group II, was inoculated with combined H120 and CR88 vaccines. At 14 days of age, birds in Group I and II were revaccinated with CR88 vaccine. Group III was sham-inoculated at 1-day and 14 days old. Each chick was inoculated via oculo (50 \u00b5l)-nasal (50 \u00b5l) routes. Dosages were given as recommended by the manufacturer. Following the vaccinations, the birds were observed daily for clinical signs. Blood was collected prior to vaccination (at 1 day) and 30 days old from eight chicks in each group for antibody responses. On the same day, 10 chicks from each group (vaccinated and control groups) were transferred to another isolation room and challenged by the oculonasal route with 0.1 ml of virulent IS/885 to provide 10 4.66 EID 50 /chick. Another 10 chicks from each group were similarly transferred and challenged with 0.1 ml of virulent IS/1494 to provide 10 5.00 EID 50 /chick. The remaining 10 chicks (vaccinated or unvaccinated control) in each group were left as unchallenged controls. The birds were observed daily for clinical signs during the postchallenge period. Five days after challenge, all ten chicks in each unchallenged and challenged group were humanely euthanased by wing vein injection of 0.5-1 ml of Euthenal ( pentobarbitone sodium, Rhone Merrieux, Ireland). Vaccine protection was evaluated by a ciliostasis test and examination of trachea and kidneys for gross lesions.",

It appears that the protection conferred was much improved when the CR88 was given together (Group II) with the H120 at day-old in contrast to H120 given alone (Group 1). It must be noted that the vaccine programme given to group II also offered 100 per cent kidney protection from both isolates. In a previous study performed in specific pathogen-free chicks, live H120 vaccination afforded protection of the trachea (92 per cent) and the kidney (25 per cent) on the basis of virus isolation when the birds were challenged with IS/885/00 (Meir and others 2004) . Moreover, immunisation with live H120, H52 and D274 given singly was reported to produce little crossprotection from challenge with other nephropathogenic IBV strains (Albassam and others 1986 , Lambrechts and others 1993 , Pensaert and Lambrechts 1994 ).

The cut-off titre=3log 2 H120+CR88, d14:CR88) as compared with group I (d0: H120, d14:CR88), could be due to the higher levels of local and cellular immunity at the tracheal site which may have prevented the virulent virus from reaching the kidneys (Lambrechts and others 1993) . In an another experiment, cellular and local immunity induced by administration of combined live Massachusetts and 793B-type vaccines at day-old showed a significant increase in the expression of CD4+, CD8+ and IgA-bearing B cells in the trachea compared with single H120 alone or unvaccinated groups (Awad and Ganapathy, unpublished) . These results reinforce the importance of optimising local and cell-mediated mucosal immunity at the respiratory lining through strategic heterologous day-old vaccination for enhanced protection from variant viruses.",

In this study, at 30 days of age (challenge day) the mean ELISA titre and the mean 793B HI titre in group II were significantly higher than the other vaccinated group. This reflects that combined live IBV vaccination at day-old and revaccination at 14 days-old has provided an immunological boost compared with the other vaccination schedule (group 1). Although it has been demonstrated before that circulating humoral antibody levels are of minor importance in the protection from IBV infection (Raggi and Lee 1965 , Darbyshire and Peters 1985 , Endo-Munoz and Faragher 1989 , Pensaert and Lambrechts 1994 , in the present study the group with higher levels of humoral antibodies had better protection from both of the Middle East isolates. Cytotoxic T cell plays a vital anti-viral activity during early stages of IBV infection while serum IgG is critical at the late stage of IBV infection (Collisson and others 2000) .",
