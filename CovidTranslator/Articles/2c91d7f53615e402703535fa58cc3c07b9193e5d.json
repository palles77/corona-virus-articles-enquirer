Some compounds, such as aminoglycosides and penicillins, are isolated from living organisms, whereas others, such as oxazolidinones, quinolones, and sulfonamides, are produced by chemical synthesis. Accordingly, antibiotics can be classified based on their origin as natural origin, semisynthetic origin, or synthetic origin. Most of the common antibiotics used today are semisynthetic modifications of a variety of natural compounds. These antibiotics are used in both human medicine and animal agriculture to reduce incidences of diseases. They are usually administered by injection or orally via feed and water.",

Generally, 'growth promoter' refers to products that help to grow an animal faster for the same unit amount of feed consumed in a given period of time. Several researchers have shown that low-concentration (usually 2.5-50 mg kg \u00c01 ) addition of antibiotics to animal feed results in an accelerated growth rate and improved feed conversion efficiency in agricultural animals such as cattle, pigs, sheep, and poultry (Amy et al., 2007) . The improvement in average growth rate was estimated to be between 4% and 8%, and feed utilization was improved from 2% to 5% in 1994 (Ewing and Cole, 1999) ; a majority of recent studies have shown larger benefits, up to 10% gain in both weight and feed conversion efficiency (JETACAR, 1999) .",

But, based on recent in vivo animal experiments, the antibactericidal effect of antibiotics is the most likely explanation for growth promotion. Antibiotics may help concentrate nutrients by reducing the amount of several intestinal bacteria that are able to divert nutrition away from an animal's body. In addition, antibiotics could also inhibit release of toxins in the gut by intestinal bacteria. Antimicrobial growth promoters could also help increase the availability and absorption of nutrients and energy by maintaining the composition of gut microflora, thus thinning the barrier in small intestine and at the same time assisting the digestion of grainbased high-energy diets.",

            "text": "In the cattle industry, major antibiotics including flavophospholipol, monensin, and virginiamycin are commonly used as growth promoters in the United States (Peter and John, 2004) . Owing to the high energy requirements of cattle, growth promoters may play an important role by stimulating muscle formation and improving milk productivity (Peter and John, 2004) . However, the use of growth promoters can have several side effects in cattle. The most common harmful effect is lactic acidosis, which both impairs milk production and debilitates cattle. To counteract this side effect and maintain a balance between benefit and harm, administration of lasalocid and monensin are probably the safest and most effective antibiotic growth promoters due to their activity in inhibiting most of the lactate-producing bacterial species without harming the major lactate fermenters. Australian cattle farmers also employ flavophopholipol, lasalocid, and monensin (JET-ACAR, 1999) . Other cattle growth promoters used in Australia include narasin, oleandomycin, and salinomycin. The use of glycopeptide avoparcin was no longer permitted after 2000. In the European Union, the same types of ionophoresmonensin and salinomycinare used in cattle. However, the use of Table 1 The most commonly employed antibiotics in farm animals worldwide pristinamicin and quinupristin has been banned since 2000 (Dibner and Richards, 2005) . For the poultry meat and egg industries, specific growth promoters such as flavophospholipol and virginiamycin are employed in the United States (Peter and John, 2004) . In Australia, poultry producers use arsenical compounds, flavophospholipol, bacitracin, and virginiamycin (JETACAR, 1999) . Growth promoters are not allowed to be used in layer farms in Australia. In Europe, major growth promoters used in the poultry industry include avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, and virginiamycin. According to several recent studies, a 10 mg per kg dose of avoparcin is able to improve feed conversion efficiency by 2.96%, increase the growth rate of meat chickens by 2.37%, and increase 1.33 net cents per kg liveweight; 17.6 mg per kg dose of virginiamycin, similarly, is able to increase these three values by 3.48%, 3.19%, and 1.48%, respectively (Mehdi et al., 2011) .",

In fact, from the point of view of many consumers, the use of antibiotics as growth promoters has negative effects on public health, and a certain percentage of consumers want to reduce or control the use of antibiotics in food animals, regardless of their practical advantages. The use of antibiotics as growth promoters is being curtailed under consumer pressure.

Since the benefits of growth promotion may result from the alteration of gut microflora, alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters may be required to improve animal intestinal gut flora through natural and organic bioactive and functional feed supplements. Therefore, research interest has concentrated on following the five approaches: in-feed enzymes, probiotics, prebiotics, organic acids, bioactive phytochemicals, and competitive exclusion of pathogens by-products being administered via water or feed. So far, none have been proved to replace the use of antibiotics in growth stimulation thoroughly and successfully, and thus further research is needed. The possibilities of using these potential alternatives to synthetic antibiotics are explored below.",

In-feed enzymes are usually produced by fermentation of fungi and bacteria, after which these are used to stimulate growth as additives in animal feeds. Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of in-feed enzymes as a substitute for antibiotic growth promoters for improving nutrient absorption and digestibility, gaining body weight, and animal performance. Based on recent studies, it was demonstrated that in-feed enzymes often have activities in promoting digestion of feed components that are normally poorly digested or totally undigested in agricultural animals (Hedemann et al., 2009) . The mechanism by which in-feed enzymes promote digestion of feed components is believed to involve the breakdown of those hard-to-digest chemical components in the grains and meals such as nonstarch polysaccharides, especially arabinoxylans and beta-glucans, phytates, and proteins (Gerard et al., 2011) . Added routinely to the feed of livestock and poultry, these enzymes are efficient at maximizing feed conversion efficiency, and more importantly they have no or very few side effects. As a consequence, numerous researchers are now focusing on improving the quality of existing enzymes, intending to broaden the range of feed ingredients in which they could be used as alternative growth promoters.",

Products such as Broilact TM , Avigard TM , and Preempt TM are often administered to newborn animals, especially poultry, and have shown their effectiveness in animal growth promotion, gut health maintenance, and even the control of pathogenic infection (Alaeldein, 2013) . Several studies have found that a significant improvement of animal feed conversion ratio using Avigard treatment results from the reduction in feed intake and also the prevention of pathogenic colonization such as Salmonella and Campylobacter from the gut (Gerard et al., 2011) .

A report from the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition (2001) concerning the safety of probiotic products found that Lactobacillus plantarum and Pediococcus acidilactici were tetracycline-resistant. As a consequence, the use of probiotics could possibly put the whole food chain and the environment at risk. Moreover, the permanent establishment of probiotics in animal gastrointestinal tracts is difficult. Several studies have indicated that gut microflora are active and efficient in preventing new organisms from colonizing and becoming established (Jonsson and Conway, 1992) .

Zoonotic pathogens colonized in the gastrointestinal tract of food animals can be shed in feces. Fecal contents play a significant role in carcass cross-contamination and are likely to reach consumers and food processors. In addition, fecal content is a direct source for pathogens in water, soil, vectors, and crops. As a consequence, it remains a major public health concern to reduce the foodborne pathogenic bacteria populations at the farm level. A broad range of preharvest intervention strategies have been employed, and some are still under development. Owing to increased worldwide concern about the transmission of antibiotic resistance from farm animals to humans, the preharvest use of antibiotics has been limited and even gradually prohibited. Though the reduced preslaughter use of antibiotics to reduce foodborne pathogens in farm animals has been partially offset by an increased use of prescribed antibiotics for therapeutic purposes, the direct use of several common antibiotics and alternative natural antimicrobial agents as a substitute for antibiotics is urgently needed. Major potential natural strategies include using bacteriocin, vaccination, introducing bacteriophages, adding enzymes or organic acids as feed supplements, and the enhancement of competition by introducing substrate-adapted competitive products such as probiotics and prebiotics. Parallel and simultaneous application of more than one preharvest strategy could be a promising strategy to synergistically lower the incidence of foodborne illness.",

Various agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites are responsible for more than 200 known foodborne diseases. Among the numerous and various threats, Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC), Campylobacter, and Listeria are the leading causes of meat products-related illness and deaths in the United States. Most of these foodborne pathogens are able to live on the skin or in the gastrointestinal tract of food animals such as cattle, swine, sheep, and poultry, especially chickens and turkeys, and in the farm environment where the soil is fertilized with composted animal manure (D'Aoust et al., 2008; Meng et al., 2008; Nachamkin, 2008; Swaminathan et al., 2008) . Thus, antibiotics have been widely employed in preharvest use in farm animals and in humans to reduce foodborne pathogens and to prevent foodborne illness. In spite of the widespread use of antibiotics in animals, it is often difficult to choose a specific antibiotic which could target specific pathogens because the microbes usually fall into diverse groups. As a result, broadspectrum antibiotics are usually employed in preharvest animals. Based on recent research, antibiotic treatment for controlling gastrointestinal pathogens has been found to disrupt the gut microbial ecosystem and thus impair animal health, meat or milk production, and even food safety. Despite the potential shortcomings of antibiotic preharvest treatment, recent research at the farm animal level has shown that antibiotics do have the potential to kill foodborne pathogens inside the body and thus improve food safety.",

Transmission of enteric salmonellosis to humans usually occurs through consumption of contaminated poultry and poultry products, specifically eggs. Owing to the presence of multiple antibiotic-resistant strains of Salmonella, antibiotic treatment against this pathogen has been compromised at least to some extent. One major concern is the strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (DT104) commonly found in poultry and eggs. DT104 is demonstrated to be resistant to at least five antibioticsampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline. Preharvest control of DT104 continues to be a significant challenge due to its increased virulence by alterations of inherent pathogenic characteristics and treatment failures resulting from the inappropriate use of antibiotics (Besser et al., 2000) . However, combined use of trimethoprim and sulfonamide at the preharvest level might be effective in reducing Salmonella in chicken gut. Other possible choices include fluoroquinolones and the third-generation cephalosporins (D'Aoust et al., 2008) ; Table 2 shows the preslaughter FDA-approved antibiotics commonly used in the poultry industry (Teshome et al., 2007) .",

EHEC is mainly harbored in the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy cattle and is shed in their feces. The major source of EHEC was traced to ruminant manure, but undeniably, EHEC was also identified in some nonruminant farm animals including swine and fowl due to the cross-contamination spread by ruminant manure. But, since bovine manure is the major source of EHEC contamination in the farm environment and animal meat products, effective preharvest control targeting reduced prevalence and quantity of fecal EHEC excretion by live cattle is crucial. EHEC does not typically exhibit the drug resistance to the use of multiple antibiotics which is frequently found in enteropathogenic E. coli and other foodborne pathogens like Campylobacter and Salmonella, though the use of ionophores does not show significant influence on the prevalence of EHEC LeJeune and Kauffman, 2006) . However, it has been shown that almost all EHEC isolates are susceptible to neomycin sulfate (Mora et al., 2005) . Neomycin sulfate is an approved antibiotic used in cattle, where it has been demonstrated to significantly decrease the fecal excretion of EHEC (Elder et al., 2002; Woerner et al., 2006) . Given appropriate use and quick withdrawal, neomycin appears to be a promising candidate for preharvest use in the cattle industry.

Specificity allows bacteriophages to be used against targeted foodborne pathogens in a mixed population without disturbing the composition of normal gut microflora. In 2007, a phage spray produced by Omnilytics (Salt Lake City, UT), specifically against EHEC in preharvest live cattle, was approved by the FDA. Other studies have also tested the short-term reduction of Salmonella colonization in poultry and swine (Callaway et al., 2008) . Several researchers have also tested the oral consumption of large doses of bacteriophages and found it to be harmless to animals. Owing to their rapid replication and high level of specificity, bacteriophages can serve as a potential preharvest strategy against foodborne pathogens in agricultural animals. However, the efficacy of bacteriophages against infecting bacteria should be tested in the lab before application. The specificity of bacteriophages is also a disadvantage when a need to target multiple pathogens or causative agents of disease is not confirmed (Inal, 2003) . In addition, compared to antibiotics, bacteriophages are more complex organisms that are able to transfer genes between bacteria and induce pathogenic mutation. Only by careful selection of strictly lytic bacteriophages and sequencing their hereditary materials can crossgene transfer be prevented (Inal, 2003) . In comparison with antibiotics, the administration of bacteriophages requires trained personnel, which makes the application of bacteriophages much more difficult for farmers.",

Organic acids produced by the anaerobic microflora of the large intestine include acetate, lactate, malate, and propionate. Some of them have been shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria such as EHEC, Salmonella, and Campylobacter (Huyghebaert et al., 2011) . Various plant products can also serve as antimicrobial agents. For example, pasteurized blueberry juices have been shown to have antimicrobial effects on multiple major foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella Typhimurium, C. jejuni, L. monocytogenes, and EHEC (Biswas et al., 2012) . Other organics such as cocoa, peanut skin, and the pomace of blueberry and blackberry have also shown antimicrobial activity but need further study. Multiple fruits and vegetables contain phenolic compounds, such as lignins and tannins, both of which are able to affect the gastrointestinal tract via antimicrobial activity (Cueva et al., 2010) . Tannins have been found to significantly reduce the population of EHEC in cattle (Wang et al., 2009) . Another study showed that highly lignified forages could reduce the shedding period of EHEC (Wells et al., 2005) . In addition, most of the essential oils such as citrus oil usually exert their antimicrobial effects by disrupting the cell membrane of bacteria (Turgis et al., 2009) . As a result, both organic acids and bioactive phytochemicals have been proposed as potential preharvest agents against foodborne pathogens in farm animals.",

In 2007, global sales of animal health products included: Western Europe (US$110 million), North America (US$725 million), the Far East (US$435 million), Latin America (US$275 million), Eastern Europe (US $150 million), and the rest of world (US$80 million) (Evans et al., 2008) . Antibiotics used for veterinary therapy are often administered orally through feed and water, or by injection, in order to relieve animals' suffering and reduce production losses. However, if certain livestock or poultry are sick, the whole herd or flock needs to be treated to prevent the spread of disease. In these cases, antibiotic treatment is usually given in high doses, intermittently within a relatively short period of time. Broad-spectrum or combinations of antibiotics are commonly used in such situations when the specific pathogens of concern are unidentified or in doubt. Worldwide estimated sales of antibiotic products in 2007 include macrolides (US$629 million, 22.7%), penicillins (US$550 million, 19.8%), tetracyclines (US$533 million, 19.2%), quinolones (US$531 million, 19.1%), and sulphonamides (US $118 million, 4.3%), with the leading products being oxytetracycline (US$272 million), enrofloxacin (US$259 million), chlortetracycline (US$257 million), ceftiofur (US$200 million), florfenicol (US$114 million), and tulathromycin (US $90 million) (Evans et al., 2008) . However, a narrow-spectrum antibiotic able to target a specific pathogen involved in animal disease should be the first choice and could also lower the risk level of antibiotic resistance. The major animal diseases requiring therapeutic use of antibiotics are respiratory and enteric diseases in calves and pigs, necrotic enteritis in poultry, and mastitis in dairy cattle.",

Clostridium perfringens is the major causative bacteria of necrotic enteritis. However, the occurrence of this disease is always associcated with the outbreak coccidial infection, which induces the gut to be more susceptible to C. perfringens (Dahiya et al., 2006) . Tetracycline, streptomycin, neomycin, bacitracin, and avilamycin in feed are the four most common antibiotics targeting necrotic enteritis (Wages, 2001) . Control of C. perfringens infection together with prevention of coccidiosis could be accomplished by adding antibiotics such as virginiamycin (20 g ton \u00c01 ), bacitracin (50 g ton \u00c01 ), and lincomycin (2 g ton \u00c01 ) to feed (Wages, 2001) . The ionophore classes of anticoccidial compounds are also effective in preventing coccidial infections. In addition, probiotics administration is also used as an effective method to both prevent and treat clinical necrotic enteritis.",

Multiple antibiotic residues are harmful during the development of human organs, as well as the nervous and reproductive systems. As a result, infants and young children are most susceptible to these residue compounds because of their weak body protection. By establishing preslaughter withdrawal periods, restricting certain antibiotics used in laying hens, and discarding milk produced after intramammary infusions of antibiotics in lactating animals, these harmful antibiotic residues could be reduced or even eliminated (Page and Gautier, 2012) .",

Whether or not the pool of resistance genes generated by use of antibiotics in farm animals has induced the prevalence of failures in therapy for human infectious diseases is compounded by the widespread use of antibiotics in livestock and poultry is still controversial. So far, judging from numerous journal articles, reviews, conference reports, newspapers, and TV reports, the inappropriate use of antibiotic in farm animals and its potential risk to human health have become the greatest public health concern among both consumers and scientists.

These agents are used to protect against illness, help reduce significant agricultural losses, and prevent foodborne infections in humans. For the subtherapeutic use of antimicrobials, preharvest treatment for both promotion of animal growth and inhibition of colonization and crosscontamination of foodborne pathogens have drawn great attention because of the urgency of the situation as well as the effectiveness of antibiotics in human disease treatment. However, some agents used in animal agriculture belong to classes also employed in human medicine, such as macrolides, penicillins, sulphonamides, and tetracyclines. This dual use of antibiotics and the common concern of multiple antibiotic resistance in human pathogens and the potential impact of antibiotic residues in food on public health are controversial and have raised concerns. As a result, efforts to develop alternatives such as plant-derived antimicrobial agents and biopreservatives are underway. Although the thoughtful and measured therapeutic use of antibiotics or other effective antimicrobials is essential to livestock producers, regulatory bodies, and consumers, narrow-spectrum antibiotics remain the first choice, and a comprehensive understanding of the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics in preharvest-level farm animal production, along with proper guidance from the veterinary profession, are vital to solving this complex issue.",
