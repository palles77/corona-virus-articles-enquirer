A key intervention in preventing NC is elimination of taeniasis by chemotherapy. Currently, two safe and effective taenicides, namely niclosamide and praziquantel, are available. Both are on WHO Essential Drug list, but are often inaccessible in T. solium endemic areas. Natural remedies, still widely used in some endemic areas, are frequently carcinogenic or highly toxic and as such should be discontinued. Chemotherapeutic intervention to control T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis, whilst theoretically feasible, has several practical obstacles. These include poor public awareness, problems with diagnosing Taenia carriers, poor availability of taenicides where needed and low priority afforded to the control of NC. These can be overcome, respectively, by effective health education, wider use of newly developed coproantigen tests, strengthening of health services infrastructure and essential drugs distribution, and increasing the priority given to prevention of NC, as a leading cause of epilepsy in T. solium endemic areas. Information is accumulating on rational approaches to population-based short-term chemotherapeutic control measures. These are: widely available modern diagnostic tools and taenicides, treatment of any case of taeniasis, confirmed or probable, focus-oriented chemotherapy, irrespective of Taenia species implicated, improved sanitation, cooperation of veterinary and medical services, linkage with programs against epilepsy and cooperation of better educated communities. Now, it remains to take an advantage of existing tools and experience. D",

In treating hundreds of T. saginata carriers since 1952, male fern extract was used only sporadically, due to fatal cases of intoxication being reported. In the 1950s, there was no other choice in Poland than to try pumpkinseeds (163 patients were treated with 60 -65% cure rate). The seeds were replaced in the late 1950s by atabrine or an acridine derivative-Acranil given per os (respectively, 44 and 89 patients treated with 42% and 88% cure rate). Later, metallic tin compounds became available (226 patients -88% cured) but then discontinued after reports of toxicity [7] . Then the time ''worm cure without tears'' arrived when niclosamide was introduced in the 1960, followed by praziquantel a decade later. With these safe taenicides, a high cure rate, respectively 80% and 90%, was achieved in hundreds of T. saginata carriers; it is generally accepted that T. saginata tapeworm is more resistant to anthelmintics than T. solium [8] .",

Later, it was observed that some generic products are less effective than the original ones and that niclosamide may loose efficacy during storage, probably due to polymerisation of its active particles. The production of niclosamide was much reduced in 1990s, whilst praziquantel increasingly became the taenicide of choice since it was at least 5\u00c2 cheaper per treatment.

This process can be accelerated by various factors, including the use of taenicides such as praziquantel, which is absorbed and partly pass the blood -brain barrier. In fact, possible induction of symptomatic NC by using a single dose of praziquantel has been reported [13] . This phenomenon is probably related to the individual variability of praziquantel concentration in serum and in brain tissue, but it is rare. Symptoms possibly related to activation of cysticercosis were observed in one person among 10,173 people treated with praziquantel in Ecuador [14] . No such cases were observed during mass treatment of schistosomiasis with larger doses of praziquantel in Africa. Therefore, the risk of inducing symptomatic cysticercosis, as an adverse effect of treatment with a single dose of praziquantel, cannot be a reason to limit the use of praziquantel in taeniasis, but should be rather accepted as a calculated infrequent ''price to be paid'' for treating a T. solium tapeworm carrier, being a potential source of NC.

It has been accepted that control means reduction of disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity and mortality to a locally acceptable level as a result of deliberate efforts. This is what is urgently needed in the prevention of NC. Elimination of infection was defined as a reduction to zero of the incidence of a specified infection in a defined geographical area. This will be very difficult to achieve with NC even in limited areas. Eradication is meant as a permanent reduction to zero the worldwide incidence of a specific infection. A decade ago, taeniasis/cysticercosis was a candidate for worldwide potential eradication [17] but now it is no longer considered as such because of the insufficient operational experience [18] .",

Consequently, chemotherapy of taeniasis becomes an indispensable element of any control interventions [19 -23] . This has to be supported by health education and wider availability of diagnostic tools. Interventions, which reduce pig cysticercosis, such as sanitation, pigs chemotherapy, vaccination, meat inspection are auxiliary measures, which may make a success of control by chemotherapy of the carriers quicker and more permanent. The decision, which auxiliary measure(s) have to be implemented, depends on local endemic situation and control abilities [4] .",

The long-term strategy, usually a nationwide, is designed to act over decades and depends on steady improvements in the quality of medical and veterinary services, health education, economy and legislation. Its coordination requires an administrative body. A short-term strategy was developed to allow for local urgency and severity of NC problem in some regions. It is designed to act over years and in restricted areas and requires mobilization of local public health, medical and veterinary services. The third alternative strategy, recently suggested [4] , is a horizontal approach by incorporation of simple control measures into the existing health services activities, by given them instructions and diagnostic and therapeutic control tools. Which strategy is accepted and how it would be implemented and monitored depends again on local endemic situation and local control abilities.",

The diagnos-tic sensitivity of the traditional methods is low: questioning for expulsion a tapeworm -about 50%, finding tapeworm proglottids or Taenia spp. eggs in faeces -30-50% each. Only the coproantigen tests offer the sensitivity close to 100%. It may not differentiate T. solium from other Taenia spp. but this is not a critical point because any tapeworm in humans deserves to be eliminated for medical or epidemiological reasons. The coproantigen tests are stable and can be easily distributed, stored and do not request any specific equipment to be performed (Allan in Pawlowski et al. [4] ). Coproantigen tests may be very useful in diagnosing individual Taenia carriers in hospitals or as outpatients as well as in screened populations e.g., in rural areas or military units [24] . A cost of the test could be low at a larger scale production. However, their availability is limited as in endemic regions there are only a few specialised laboratories, which can undertake commercial production of such a test, in cooperation with and supervision of some existing scientific reference centers (Allan in Pawlowski et al. [4] ).",

In the Andean region, where over 11,000 persons were treated in 26 localities, there were 5 localities without any T. solium carriers, 16 localities having 0.1% to 5.0% of population infected with T. solium and 5 localities with the prevalence of T. solium carriers between 7.1% and 21.1% [14] .
