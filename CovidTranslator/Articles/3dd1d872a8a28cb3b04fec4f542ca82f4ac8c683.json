            "text": "As a key humoral regulator of phosphate homeostasis and its involvement in the pathogenesis of human disease, human fibroblast growth factor 23 (hFGF23) has become a particularly attractive therapeutic target. To prepare soluble and bioactive recombinant human FGF23 to meet the increasing demand in its pharmacological application, small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-FGF23 fusion gene and FGF23 non-fusion gene were amplified by standard PCR methods and cloned into vector pET-22b and pET-3c, then transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) and BL21 (DE3). The best combination of plasmid and host strain was screened, and only Rosetta (DE3)/pET-SUMO-FGF23 was screened for rhFGF23 protein expressed. The average bacterial yield and the soluble expression level of recombinant hFGF23 of three batches attained 687\u00b118 g and 30\u00b11.5%, respectively, after treatment with 0.4 mM isopropyl-thio-\u03b2-galactopyranoside for 19 h at 16\u00b0C in a 30-L fermentor, after which it was purified by DEAE Sepharose FF and nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Once cleaved by the SUMO protease, the recombinant human FGF23 was released from the fusion protein. The purity of rFGF23 was shown by high performance liquid chromatography to be greater than 90% and the yield was 60\u00b11.5 mg/L. In vitro data showed that the purified rFGF23 can induce the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases in the glioma U251 cell. The results of in vivo animal experiments also showed that rFGF23 could decrease the concentration in the plasma of normal rats fed with a fixed formula diet.",

            "text": "Human fibroblast growth factor 23 (hFGF23), a member of the FGF superfamily, was first identified in 2000 (Yamashita et al. 2000) . The full-length hFGF23 consists of 251 amino acids with a signal peptide of 24 amino acids at the Nterminus, splicing a mature FGF23 polypeptide of 227 amino acids (Yamashita et al. 2000) . FGF23 reduces serum phosphate by inhibiting both proximal tubular phosphate reabsorption and intestinal phosphate absorption (Shimada et al. 2004) . This is concerning the FGF23 physiological function of regulating phosphate metabolism; on the other hand, mutations in FGF23 are implicated in a wide range of disorders. Both autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets and X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets were caused by excess FGF23, leading to hypophosphatemia (2000; Jonsson et al. 2003; Yamazaki et al. 2002) . FGF23 levels are increased tenfold above controls in patients with tumorinduced osteomalacia, a tumor associated syndrome of renal phosphate wasting (Jonsson et al. 2003; Yamazaki et al. 2002) . Circulating FGF23 levels are also increased and correlate with disease burden in patients with fibrous dysplasia, a disorder in which normal bone is replaced by fibroosseous tissue (Riminucci et al. 2003) . Reduced FGF23 signaling also causes pathology. Familial tumoral calcinosis is a disorder marked by hyperphosphatemia in which individuals develop calcified masses, often within the joints (Lyles et al. 1985 ). In addition, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), FGF23 concentrations are elevated constitutively and increase progressively as kidney function worsens (Gutierrez et al. 2005) , suggesting a direct link between increased FGF23 and the progression of CKD (Fliser et al. 2007) .",

In the next step, it is necessary to prepare sufficient hFGF23 with activity for further mechanisms and pharmacological research. Yamashita et al (2000) has expressed FGF23 in CHO mammalian cell. It is well known that the mammalian cell expression system is more complicated and costly from the standpoint of culture requirements, making this strategy difficult to use in the development of largescale fermentation processes. Furthermore, the preparation of sufficient amounts of virus for large-scale expression is time consuming. To overcome this shortcoming, Plotnikov et al. (2000) expressed FGF23 in Escherichia coli in the form of an inclusion body; however, because the inclusion bodies must be denatured and annealed, it was difficult to produce bioactive protein. Our previous experiments showed that FGF23 without using this fusion strategy was least effective in expression and solubility properties.",

As illustrated in Fig. 6a , the phosphorylation of MAPK were activated by either rFGF23 or commercial FGF23; also, the rFGF23-induced phosphorylation of ERK (141% activation, compared with negative-treated group) was more than that of commercial FGF23 (116% activation, compared with negative-treated group).

Compared to commercial FGF23, however, rFGF23 afforded a better hypophosphatemic effect (Fig. 6b) .

Specific explanation is that FGF23 suppresses the expression of type 2a and 2c sodiumphosphate cotransporters which mediate the physiological phosphate reabsorption in proximal tubules (Shimada et al. 2004) ; the other is that FGF23 decreases the expression of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1\u03b1-hydroxylase and at the same time enhances 25-hydroxyvtamin D-24-hydroyxlase expression (Shimada et al. 2004) . By modifying the expression of these vitamin D metabolizing enzymes, FGF23 acts to reduce serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], which stimulates intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption. In our studies, we can also see that the changes in plasma phosphate levels all showed significant differences after either injecting rFGF23 or commercial FGF23, compared to Fig. 6 In vitro and in vivo activity assay of rFGF23. a In vitro activity assay of rFGF23.
