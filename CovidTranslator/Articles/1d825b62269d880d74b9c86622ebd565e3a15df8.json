Constant immunosurveillance is provided by the skin immune system that consists of orchestrated interactions between Langerhans cells, keratinocytes, lymphocytes, and dermal dendritic cells. Hair and melanin pigment deliver the bulk of photoprotection as well as provide thermoregulation. The epidermis is also an important site of vitamin D regulation. Sunlight acts on the epidermis to convert provitamin D3 (7-dehydrocholesterol) to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). In the liver, vitamin D3 is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxy D3 and in kidneys to the active form 1,25-vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 regulates epidermal differentiation and proliferation. The skin is involved in thermoregulation by virtue of the pelage, blood flow, and, in some species (e.g., equids), sweating.

The vast surface area of the skin puts it in constant contact with environmental irritants, pollutants, and pathogens. Unlike diseases in internal viscera, lesions in the skin are readily apparent, and thus skin disease is one of the most common reasons for veterinary consultation. Skin diseases range from minor, esthetic problems to life-threatening conditions. In companion animals, a healthy pelage (haircoat) stands as the interface between the human owner and pet. In addition to causing undo suffering, severe skin disease may interfere with the human-animal bond. In farm animals, skin diseases produce severe economic losses because of damage to wool, hides, and meat or from decreased milk production or growth rates.",

Desmosomes are anchoring structures that mediate adhesion between cells. They have a complex structure that includes cadherin proteins of 2 types-desmocollins and desmogleins. These proteins have different isoforms, and they are differentially expressed in different layers of the epidermis.

This inconspicuous layer is an active and tough hydrophobic barrier that regulates water movement into and out of the skin. Much of the content of the SC is lost during biopsy sampling, cutting, and processing. The basket-weave pattern is an artifact resulting from loss of the lipid lamellae during processing. Thickness varies by species and site, but it is generally adapted to the degree of surface trauma or friction. The SC is thickest in nonhaired areas, such as footpads and nasal planum. Cornification (keratinization) is the process by which keratinocytes undergo terminal differentiation from the basal layer to the highly specialized corneocyte. In doing so, keratinocytes must lose a large amount of water volume (from 70% water in nucleated layers to 15% in stratum corneum). Minor injuries to the corneal layer from tape stripping or applications of solvents will result in increased transepidermal water loss. Several steps must occur for cornification to proceed normally: (1) bundling of keratin to establish the corneocyte core, (2) replacement of the cell membrane with a thick cornified envelope, (3) formation of lipid lamellar bilayers, and (4) active desquamation. Alterations in any step can lead to hyperkeratosis, clinical scaling, and decreased barrier function.",

This fact underscores the importance of the inclusion of the gross findings in the surgical pathology request. Although the architecture of the skin is conserved across most mammalian species, the pathologist must be aware of differences between species and site differences within the same species, to interpret normal versus abnormal. The dermis contributes most to the thickness of the skin. The haired skin is thickest over the dorsal surface of the body and lateral aspect of the limbs and thinnest on the ventral aspect of the trunk and medial limbs. The epidermis is naturally thicker in areas that need enhanced protection because of lack of hair and exposure to surface trauma (e.g., lips, pawpads, and nasal planum).

The keratinocytes of the epidermis undergo a process of differentiation and proliferation that facilitates repair after external trauma and yields a hydrophobic protective barrier, the stratum corneum, which is continuously shed into the environment. The steady state of the epidermis is a balance between cell proliferation, differentiation, and desquamation. The renewal is provided by a small population of slow-cycling stem cells (~10% of cells) in the basal layer that undergo proliferation into transiently amplifying cells. The amplified cells briefly proliferate then exit the cell cycle and undergo terminal differentiation. In doing so, the cells march toward the final product-fullycornified anucleate keratinocytes (corneocytes) that are shed into the environment. Within keratinocytes as well as other epithelial cells, keratin, an intermediate filament, forms the fibrous cytoskeleton that connects to desmosomes. Type I (acidic) and type II (basic) keratin subunits assemble into heterodimers through disulfide bonds. The type of keratin is differentially expressed in layers of the epidermis as well as body site (e.g., nonhaired skin of the pawpad and hair follicles). Keratin 5 (K5) and keratin 14 (K14) form heterodimers in basal layer keratinocytes. Commitment to differentiation in suprabasal keratinocytes is associated with induction of keratins 1 (K1) and K10. Keratin 2 (K2) is expressed in the stratum granulosum (SG).",

            "text": "The epidermis is a prime example of an adult tissue that undergoes continual and rapid flux. The epidermis maintains homeostasis by constant proliferation of a single inner (basal) layer of rapidly dividing progeny of stem cells. As the basal keratinocytes withdraw from the cell cycle, the transiently amplifying cells commit to terminally differentiate, detaching from the basement membrane and initiating a trek toward the skin surface. \u2022 The stratum basale (basal layer) is the deep germinative layer of the epidermis and is composed of a single layer of cuboidal to low columnar cells resting on the basement membrane zone. The basal cells are attached to the gens, CD45, vimentin, and S-100. The long dendritic processes of Langerhans cells traverse the intercellular space to the granular cell layer, where they function in immunosurveillance as antigen-presenting cells. Langerhans cells trap antigens in the epidermis and migrate via afferent lymphatics to draining lymph nodes, where they present antigen to T cells in paracortical areas, resulting in proliferation of a population of sensitized T cells. Langerhans cells express a high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE) (Fc\u03b5RI), which allows Fc receptor-mediated uptake of allergens. Exposure to UVB radiation decreases Langerhans cell numbers in the epidermis and interferes with their antigen-presenting capacity. Langerhans cells are involved in development of contact hypersensitivity, and increased numbers of epidermal Langerhans cells have been found in horses with insect hypersensitivity and dogs with atopic dermatitis. A second type of clear cell in the basal layer is the Merkel cell. There has been a long-standing debate over whether Merkel cells originate from epidermal or neural stem cells, but current studies indicate an epidermal origin. Unlike melanocytes, Merkel cells are connected to adjacent keratinocytes by desmosomes. Merkel cells are also located in the external root sheath of hair follicles. They are identified ultrastructurally by characteristic dense-core cytoplasmic granules. Immunohistochemical markers include cytokeratin, neurofilaments, neuronspecific enolase, and desmosomal proteins. Merkel cells have been identified in the dog, cat, sheep, pig, monkey, various laboratory animals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Their density in the epidermis is variable, and they are in highest numbers in areas involved with sensory perception. Merkel cells form Merkel cell-neurite complexes with axons in tylotrich pads and sinus hairs that are thought to function as gentle touch receptors that initiate slow-adapting type 1 responses. Their exact function in these structures is uncertain, but they are thought not to act as sensory cells but rather to function as abutments for deformation of the mechanosensitive nerve endings. Merkel cells are also thought to have various neuroendocrine effects and to be involved in control of the hair cycle.",

It varies in thickness in different sites and is most prominent in nonhaired areas of skin and mucocutaneous junctions. In all animals except swine, the dermal-epidermal junction is straight, and the BMZ parallels the skin surface, whereas in swine and humans, the dermal-epidermal junction is thrown into undulating folds called rete ridges. The BMZ has a crucial role in anchoring the epidermis to the dermis, and abnormalities of the BMZ result in serious and potentially fatal bullous diseases.

Hemidesmosomes are glycerophospholipids, and cholesterol sulfate, along with many modifying enzymes. During this release, enzymes modify polar \"probarrier\" lipids into nonpolar \"barrier\" lipids.

Transglutaminases, calcium-containing enzymes, are located within both the epidermis and hair follicles. These proteins (in particular, transglutaminase 1) catalyze the formation of the cornified envelope (CE) by cross-linking small protein molecules (e.g., involucrin, loricrin, cystatin A) that replace the cell membrane. The CE surrounds the protein core and provides a mechanical barrier as well as a scaffold that organizes the extracellular lipids into lamellar membranes. In the mature SC, multiple layers of corneocytes are sandwiched between layers of lipid, producing the so-called \"mortar and bricks\" analogy.

There is 1 melanocyte per 10-20 keratinocytes. The dendritic processes can be seen with silver stains. Derived from the neural crest, melanocytes migrate into the epidermis during early fetal life. Their processes are intertwined between the surrounding keratinocytes to which they transfer melanin pigment. A melanocyte and its surrounding constellation of keratinocytes is termed the \"epidermal melanin unit.\" Melanogenesis occurs in membrane-bound organelles called melanosomes, which originate from the Golgi apparatus. The melanosomes migrate to the tips of the dendrites and are phagocytosed by adjacent keratinocytes. Most melanin pigment in skin is in the basal layer, but in dark-skinned animals, melanin may be present throughout the epidermis. The epidermis of most dogs and cats is only lightly pigmented. Melanin is photoprotective, and exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light increases melanin production, often resulting in a cap of pigment granules over the nucleus. Skin pigmentation is affected by local inflammation because melanocytes respond to inflammatory mediators by increasing or decreasing melanogenesis and by altering melanin transfer to keratinocytes.",

The proliferation and differentiation is regulated by stem cell factor (SCF), a cytokine produced by fibroblasts and keratinocytes, as well as T-cell-derived cytokines (e.g., interleukin-3 [IL-3], IL-4, IL-9, IL-10). SCF is thought to home mast cells to the dermis as well as regulate the synthesis of mast cell mediators and secretory function. The receptor for SCF on mast cells is c-kit. Mast cells exert their effects by synthesizing and releasing a host of inflammatory mediators (e.g., histamine, proteases, cytokines). The release of mast cell granules is triggered by the interaction between allergens and allergen-specific IgE bound to a high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc\u03b5RI). Degranulation of both canine and human mast cells is thought to involve breakdown of their secretory granules located on the basal aspect of basal keratinocytes, and they consist of a cytoplasmic plaque that connects to the cytoskeleton and a transmembrane portion that binds to the underlying basement membrane. The cytoplasmic plaque is composed of a number of proteins, including bullous pemphigoid antigen 230 (bullous pemphigoid antigen 1) and plectin, which connect keratin 5 and 14 intermediate filaments to the plasma membrane. Hemidesmosomes also have a transmembrane portion that includes \u03b1684 integrin and bullous pemphigoid antigen 2 (type XVII collagen). The proposed ligand for \u03b1684 integrin is laminin 5, which is a component of the anchoring filaments of the lamina lucida, and this binding mediates the stable adhesion of keratinocytes to components of the BMZ. Anchoring filaments are 2-4 nm diameter filaments composed of laminin 5 (also called epiligrin, kalinin, and BM600). They pass from the plasma membrane through the lamina lucida to attach to the lamina densa. The lamina densa is composed of multiple molecules, including type IV collagen, laminin, nidogen, and several glycoproteins. The lamina densa is connected to anchoring plaques of the underlying dermis by anchoring fibrils. The subbasal lamina fibrous zone of the superficial dermis is composed of anchoring fibrils, anchoring plaques, and microfibrils.

Hair shaft length is directly related to the duration of anagen phase, which is preordained according to body region and genetics. At the onset of catagen, mitotic activity of matrix cells and melanin production by melanocytes of the hair bulb cease. The keratinocytes of the inferior segment of the follicle undergo a controlled process of involution via a burst of apoptosis. This results in the upward migration of the hair follicle and the lower follicle becoming a thin cord of epithelial cells surrounded by a fibrous root sheath. Growth of the inner root sheath stops so that the lower end of the hair shaft is surrounded by thick trichilemmal keratin. The thin cord of epithelial cells is surrounded by a thickened, corrugated glassy membrane, and as it retracts upward, it is followed by the shrunken, contracted papilla. In telogen phase, the base of the bulb is located at the level of attachment of the arrector pili muscle and is ~13 of its former length. The base of the hair is encased in trichilemmal keratin and surrounded completely by outer root sheath (club hair). A population of stem cells (secondary hair germ) remains somewhere in the permanent portion of the hair follicle. These cells eventually reform the hair follicle during the next growth cycle. In rodents, the bulge region of the follicle appears to be the site that contains slowcycling relatively undifferentiated cells from which arise a population of transient amplifying cells that become the matrix keratinocytes of the new hair bulb.

Anagen wool-growing areas have many compound follicles and consist of clusters of 3 primary follicles and a number of secondary follicles. Goats have primary follicles in groups of 3, with 3-6 secondary follicles associated with each group.

Epitrichial (apocrine) sweat glands develop embryologically from primary hair germ, and they are distributed throughout all haired skin, usually deep to the sebaceous glands. Epitrichial glands are associated with primary hair follicles only, and they tend to be largest in areas with lower hair follicle density, such as mucocutaneous junctions, interdigital follicles have a well-developed, flame-shaped, plump dermal papilla (DP) that is capped completely by the hair bulb.

A layer of columnar matrix cells lines the papilla, and melanocytes are dispersed among the matrix cells in pigmented hair follicles. Catagen, the intermediate remodeling stage, is short-lived and very difficult to assess on routine histology as it requires a perfectly sectioned follicle in a longitudinal plane. In catagen, the hair bulb is lost, and the follicular papilla devaginates. The inner root sheath is partially replaced by trichilemmal keratin. Catagen follicles have a thick glassy membrane and increased apoptotic cells.

Most perivascular dermatitides involve predominantly the superficial dermal blood vessels. In the horse and cat, most perivascular dermatitis is both superficial and deep. The primary cause of superficial perivascular dermatitis is a hypersensitivity reaction, although chronic bacterial infections, viral infections, cornification disorders, and metabolic disease can all demonstrate this pattern at some point during evolution of the condition. Perivascular infiltrates containing eosinophils should first be suspected of representing dermatitis, such as ectoparasitism, food allergy, or atopy.

Vasculitis can be immune mediated or septic. Immune-mediated vasculitis is due to type III hypersensitivity. The deposition of antigen-antibody complexes in vessel walls activates complement, which results in generation of factors chemotactic for neutrophils. Activation of neutrophils with release of reactive oxygen species and lysosomal enzymes then directly damages vessel walls. Septic vasculitis is caused by systemic infection with agents that have a predilection for endothelial cells, resulting in endothelial damage. Vasculitis can also be locally induced by bacterial antigens deposited in vessel walls. Vasculitis can further be classified on the basis of the dominant inflammatory cell within vessel walls. There are neutrophilic, eosinophilic, lymphocytic, and mixed types. It should be noted that the inflammatory cell involved often reflects the stage of the disease rather than characterizing a specific disease. \u2022 Neutrophilic vasculitis is by far the most common type and may be leukocytoclastic (associated with karyorrhexis of neutrophils resulting in \"nuclear dust\") or nonleukocytoclastic. It is seen with hypersensitivity reactions, septicemia, connective tissue disorders, equine purpura hemorrhagica, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, classical swine fever, thrombophlebitis, and as an idiopathic disorder. \u2022 Lymphocytic vasculitis may be seen with dermatomyositis, malignant catarrhal fever, vaccine-induced panniculitis, and dant finely granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm with ill-defined cell borders. Multinucleated giant cells are histiocytic variants that assume 3 morphologic forms: Langhans (nuclei form a circle or semicircle at the periphery of the cell), foreign body (nuclei are scattered throughout the cytoplasm), and Touton (nuclei form a wreath that surrounds a central, homogeneous, amphophilic core of cytoplasm that is, in turn, surrounded by abundant foamy cytoplasm). In general, these 3 forms of giant cells have little diagnostic specificity, although the Touton variety is strongly indicative of xanthomas, and the Langhans type suggests the need for an acid-fast stain. Eosinophils may predominate in feline, canine, and equine eosinophilic granuloma; in certain parasitic dermatoses (habronemiasis, elaeophoriasis, parafilariasis, dirofilariasis, dracunculiasis); in furunculosis, and in hairy vetch toxicosis. Mixed cellular infiltrates are most commonly neutrophils and macrophages (pyogranuloma), or eosinophils and macrophages (eosinophilic granuloma), or a combination of the 3 cell types. Plasma cells are common components of nodular and diffuse dermatitis in domestic animals and are of no particular diagnostic significance. They may contain eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusions that are called Russell bodies. These accumulations of glycoprotein are largely globulin and may be large enough to displace the cell nucleus. Reactions to ruptured hair follicles are a common cause of nodular and diffuse pyogranulomatous dermatitis in domestic animals, and any such lesion should be examined for keratinous and epithelial debris. All other nodular and diffuse dermatitides should be cultured, examined in polarized light for foreign material, and stained for bacteria and fungi.

It will almost always be necessary to confirm the identity of the endocrinopathy with endocrine function tests. Other causes of atrophic dermatoses include ischemia, feline acquired skin fragility, and alopecia X. Follicular and adnexal atrophy can also be secondary, rather than the primary disease process. An example is follicular atrophy as a result of a chronic inflammatory process, such as chronic allergic dermatitis, or sebaceous adenitis. In this case, there would be histologic evidence of the chronic inflammation previously present, such as scarring or epidermal hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis and superficial dermal perivascular inflammation.

Panniculitis can be divided into lobular (fat lobules are primarily involved), septal (interlobular connective tissue septa are primarily involved), and diffuse (both anatomic areas involved) types. Septal panniculitis is often associated with vasculitis. However, all 3 patterns may be seen in a single lesion from the same patient. The majority of inflammatory conditions of the panniculus are granulomatous or pyogranulomatous, and the histologic appearance of panniculitis caused by an infectious agent can be very similar to sterile panniculitis.",

There have been deliberate attempts to refine the classification system and apply structure-and function-based algorithms to understand and therapeutically address the phenotypic manifestations. Ichthyosis vulgaris, the most common form in humans is an autosomal dominant disease characterized histologically by orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis and a decreased or absent granular layer, and ultrastructurally by retention of corneodesmosomes in the stratum corneum and small or absent keratohyaline granules. It is produced by a defect in synthesis of filaggrin. X-linked ichthyosis, a recessive disorder in which males have more severe disease than female heterozygotes, is caused by an absence of steroid sulfatase activity. Steroid sulfatase acts on cholesteryl sulfate, a product of lamellar bodies, which is discharged into the intercellular space and is involved in cell cohesion in the lower stratum corneum. Failure of the enzyme to inactivate cholesteryl sulfate results in persistent cell cohesion and interferes with the normal process of desquamation. The histologic features of X-linked recessive ichthyosis are orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis with a normal or hyperplastic granular layer. Keratohyaline granules are ultrastructurally normal.

Some congenital diseases are incompatible with life and result in death at birth or shortly thereafter. Congenital abnormalities of the skin may be associated with abnormalities of other tissues or organs. In contrast, although they are genetically determined, some hereditary abnormalities of skin (genodermatoses) are not apparent at birth and may instead be manifested later in life, that is, tardive onset. For example, color-dilution alopecia may not be evident until early adulthood. These conditions are covered elsewhere in the chapter under the appropriate section. As developments in medical science have reduced the incidence of preventable diseases, an increasing awareness of genetic diseases has developed.

Ichthyosis fetalis is the more severe form, and it has been compared to the harlequin fetus form of ichthyosis in humans. Affected calves are stillborn or die shortly after birth.

Ichthyosis congenita is a less severe form compatible with life in which the limbs, abdomen, and muzzle are primarily involved. The skin is dry, hard, and inflexible like old leather, and may be prominently folded. There are flat plates of hyperkeratosis in which dense mats of hairs are entrapped. The keratin plaques are separated by shallow hyperemic fissures.

By 2 months of age, they are obviously smaller than their normal littermates. Skin lesions usually begin by 6-8 weeks of age and consist of crusty exfoliative lesions involving the distal extremities, footpads, and mucocutaneous junctions, particularly on the muzzle and mouth (eFig. 6-5). Digits are prominently splayed, and footpads develop cracks and frondlike masses of keratin. The skin is erythematous and moist under the crusts. Interdigital pyoderma and paronychia are common. Many affected dogs also have diarrhea and exhibit abnormal behavior consisting of increased aggressiveness initially, and lethargy and decreased responsiveness later in the course of disease.

The skin is wrinkled and scaly. Animals may not grow well and may have a wild temperament. The condition is a simple autosomal recessive trait.

Variation in expression of dermatomyositis in dogs suggests that factors other than simple autosomal dominant inheritance are involved in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. Immunologic mechanisms are thought to be involved in this disease in humans, and both cell-mediated and humoral immunity have been implicated in the pathogenesis. In Collies with dermatomyositis, serum levels of circulating immune complexes were found to be increased above normal before clinical disease was evident; the onset and severity of dermatitis and myositis correlated with the serum levels of circulating immune complexes and IgG, and circulating immune complex levels decreased to normal as disease resolved. These findings suggest that the immune complexes initiated inflammation rather than resulted from it. IgG was identified as the immunoglobulin component of the immune complexes, but the identity of the antigen component was not determined. Dermatomyositis has been associated with viral, bacterial, and Toxoplasma infections, but infectious agents are generally not isolated from tissues of affected people.

In some instances, the abnormality involves a change in the character of the hair rather than an absolute increase in amount. Excessively long hair is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait in Friesian cattle in Europe. The condition results in discomfort during hot weather and decreased productivity. High environmental temperature during gestation has been associated with an unusual hairy appearance of newborn lambs. The lambs are small, and most do not survive to weaning; the histologic appearance of this abnormality has not been described. Border disease is a congenital pestiviral infection of sheep in which lambs are born weak and small, have an abnormal haircoat, and exhibit tonic-clonic spasms (hairy shaker disease). Instead of the normal short, fine, closely crimped birthcoat, affected lambs have a long, straight, coarse coat. The coat abnormality is due to aberrant differentiation of hair follicles that develops only when infection occurs prior to 80 days of gestation. The histologic changes include enlargement of primary hair follicles with an increased degree of medullation and a decreased number and retarded development of secondary follicles.",

Early lesions consist of scattered individual vacuolated or shrunken, brightly eosinophilic necrotic keratinocytes in the epidermis and infundibular portion of hair follicles. Hydropic degeneration of basal keratinocytes is often present and leads to dermal-epidermal clefts that develop into vesicles that contain proteinaceous fluid, erythrocytes, and inflammatory cells. Diagnostically useful artifactual dermal-epidermal separation may be induced at the margins of the section by the shearing action of the punch biopsy. Ulceration and crusting result from lesions with extensive dermal-epidermal separation. Intraepidermal pustules are uncommon. Hyperkeratosis and acanthosis are variable. In the absence of ulceration, dermal inflammation tends to be mild and consists of mixed cells either surrounding superficial dermal vessels, hair follicles, and glands or distributed in an interface pattern, or in some cases, diffusely distributed. The infiltrate includes mononuclear cells primarily, fewer neutrophils, and occasional eosinophils and mast cells. The most consistently present histologic abnormalities are follicular atrophy and perifollicular inflammation that may be accompanied by perifollicular fibrosis (Fig. 6 -28A-C). Variable dermal fibrosis is usually evident in biopsies from dogs >6 months of age. Muscle lesions include multifocal interstitial and perivascular infiltrations with mixed cells; myofiber degeneration, regeneration, and atrophy; and fibrosis.

Inherited connective tissue disorders of skin may consist of abnormalities involving only one of these components, or there may be concurrent alterations in several components. Hereditary collagen dysplasia, the most commonly recognized connective tissue disease, is a complex group of disorders of collagen that results in decreased tensile strength of the skin and may also affect other connective tissues. Alterations in elastic fibers and ground substance may accompany some forms of collagen dysplasia, but there moderately affected dogs, lesions may resolve spontaneously in 6-12 months, whereas in severely affected dogs, lesions may regress but do not usually resolve completely, and disease may be lifelong and extensive. Lesions heal with no residual scarring in mildly affected dogs; permanent alopecic, hypopigmented, or hyperpigmented disfiguring scars develop, especially on the face, in severely affected dogs. Lesions may be exacerbated by estrus, parturition, or exposure to sunlight. Although cases of adult-onset dermatomyositis have been reported, it is likely that at least some of these dogs had mild transient lesions that were overlooked when they were pups and subsequently developed more obvious disease as adults.",

Each of the 3 polypeptide chains making up a collagen molecule have short extensions at the amino and carboxy termini.

Subsequent extracellular conversion of the procollagen to collagen requires 2 enzymes to cleave the amino- and carboxy-terminal extensions. Following cleavage of the procollagen peptides, the collagen molecules spontaneously assemble into collagen fibrils. The defect in processing of type I procollagen to collagen results in abnormal precursor molecules with peptide extensions that inhibit formation of uniform fibers and fibers capable of producing normal cross-links. They assemble instead into abnormal ribbon-shaped collagen fibrils lacking normal tensile strength.

Basal keratinocytes proliferate, then differentiate, become keratinized, and are then sloughed. In normal canine skin, the migration from the basal to the cornified layer requires 22 days, as measured by tritiated thymidine incorporation studies. This turnover rate is shortened in some skin diseases; for example, in seborrheic skin disease, it is 7-8 days. The basement membrane separates the epidermis from the dermis, and basal keratinocytes rest on this membrane anchored by hemidesmosomes and focal adhesions. Basal keratinocytes are the only cells in the epidermis that can undergo mitosis, and once mitosis occurs, the basal cell proceeds to undergo terminal differentiation. These postmitotic cells enter the stratum spinosum, develop intercellular attachments, desmosomes and adherens junctions, and change the keratin composition of the cytoplasmic keratin filaments. In the basal layer, keratins K5 and K14 are expressed, whereas in the suprabasal cells, K1 and K10 are expressed. The intercellular and cell substrate adhesions are complex. Hemidesmosomes and desmosomes are stable junctions that associate with cytoplasmic keratin filaments, whereas focal adhesions and adherens junctions connect to actin filaments and are transitory adhesions. Integrins are receptors that mediate cell-substrate adhesion, whereas cadherins mediate cell-cell adhesion. As the cells are pushed outward, they move into the stratum granulosum and start to make proteins that make up keratohyaline granules. As the cells move into the stratum corneum (SC), the cytoplasmic organelles are lost, and they become metabolically inactive. These flattened inactive keratinocytes are compacted into a keratin layer that eventually exfoliates. In this way, the epidermis is continuously regenerating and degenerating by proliferation, differentiation, and keratinization. While the cells are moving outward, keratin polypeptides form and polymerize into keratin intermediate filaments that are epithelial specific and the major component of the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells. The keratin intermediate filaments aggregate into tonofilaments that connect with desmosomes, and therefore indirectly with adjacent cells. The molecular structure of keratin is very important, and genetic mutation(s) can affect keratin filament formation. There are at least 30",

Inflammatory ceruminous otitis externa is also a constant finding. In Cocker Spaniels, cell proliferation kinetics indicate that seborrheic individuals have increased epithelial cell proliferation of the epidermis, hair follicle infundibulum, and sebaceous gland. In addition, recombinant grafting studies have shown that the hyperproliferative epidermis from seborrheic Cocker Spaniels remains hyperproliferative. These studies, although showing proliferative response, do not rule out a primary cornification disorder. Other breeds with primary, greasy seborrhea include the Basset Hound, West Highland White Terrier, German Shepherd, Dachshund, and Chinese Shar-Pei. Breeds having a dry form of primary seborrhea include the Irish Setter, Doberman Pinscher, Dachshund, and West Highland White Terrier.

Loricrin is also stored in keratohyaline granules, and this polypeptide contributes to the cell envelope, an insoluble intracytoplasmic barrier. Other proteins involved in cell envelope formation include involucrin, cystatin A, cystine-rich envelope protein (CREP), trichohyaline, small proline-rich proteins (SPRRs), sciellin, and filaggrin. These serve as substrates for the 3 transglutaminases that polymerize and crosslink these proteins in the formation of the cell envelope. The granular layer also contains small lipidrich granules-submembranous lamellar bodies (Odland bodies, membrane-coating granules)-that contain lipids necessary to form a permeability barrier between cells when they are secreted into the intercellular space. Keratinocytes forming the SC are dead and can be sloughed when desmosomes are broken down.

Longercoated animals, as typical of the Standard Poodle, initially develop a thin coat because of loss of the undercoat, and then develop symmetrical multifocal to generalized areas of patchy alopecia and brittle to broken hairs encircled by yellow to brown follicular casts. Secondary bacterial infection is common. In short-coated dogs, early lesions consist of patches of scaling and alopecia that tend to appear on the ears and dorsum. These progress to annular areas of alopecia and scaling on the trunk and head. Early histopathologic changes are characterized by granulomatous or pyogranulomatous inflammation targeted on the sebaceous glands and eventually destroying the gland ( Fig. 6-34A ). Long-coated dogs tend to have rapid and complete sebaceous gland destruction with little residual inflammation. In short-coated dogs, the lesions are more inflammatory, and sebaceous destruction progresses slowly. Inflammation can occasionally impinge secondarily on the follicular epithelium causing folliculitis. Orthokeratotic and/or parakeratotic hyperkeratosis together with follicular keratosis can be marked. In the chronic stages, both active inflammation and sebaceous glands may be absent, and there may be perifollicular fibrosis ( Fig. 6-34B ). After the disappearance of the glands, the hair follicles frequently assume a \"stretched out\" configuration and are keratin filled. Regeneration of sebaceous glands A B Further reading Rottenberg S, et al. Thymoma-associated Erythema and scaling with pruritus develop on the trunk, especially axillary and inguinal regions, and progress to involve the whole body. In chronic cases, the skin becomes lichenified, alopecic, hyperpigmented, and greasy. This combination of gross lesions has led to this condition being referred to as the \"armadillo Westie syndrome.\" Histologic epidermal lesions are characterized by irregular epidermal hyperplasia with mild to marked predominantly parakeratotic hyperkeratosis. The base of the hyperplastic epithelium can have a scalloped appearance with crowding of basilar keratinocytes, and there is multifocal spongiosis with lymphocytic exocytosis. Superficial perivascular infiltrates include neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Sebaceous glands are often markedly hyperplastic. There is commonly secondary pyoderma and/or infection with Malassezia. The absence of Malassezia organisms in histologic sections does not necessarily exclude their presence as the organisms may be lost in tissue processing. Cytologic evaluation for yeasts is a more reliable indicator of the presence and numbers of yeasts.

It is usually postinflammatory, a result of minor or chronic irritation, and may be accompanied by mild hyperkeratosis. Both melanosis and hyperkeratosis are common responses to mild injuries by agents as diverse as mites and irradiation. Hypermelanosis results from an increased rate of melanosome production, an increase in melanosome size, or an increase in the degree of melanization of the melanosome. It is usually associated with an accelerated melanocyte turnover with an increased number of melanosomes, as occurs following trauma and UV exposure. Inflammatory mediators likely play a role in stimulating melanocyte production. Activation of pre-existing immature melanocytes by sunlight, estrogen, and progesterone is thought to occur. Endothelin-1, which is produced and secreted by keratinocytes after UV irradiation, has been shown to accelerate melanogenesis. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been shown to be a mitogen for human melanocytes. Proliferating human epidermal cells in culture produce bFGF, perhaps illustrating the mechanism behind the hyperplastic and hyperpigmented lesions that typify many chronic dermatoses. Acquired hyperpigmentation may also involve hair (melanotrichia). This is usually seen as a result of inflammatory skin disorders, especially those caused by biting insects in the horse and also has been described in white Merino sheep exposed to UV light.",

            "text": "Melanin pigments are responsible for the coloration of the hair, skin, and eyes, and also play an important role in photoprotection. Melanin is synthesized by melanocytes, which are dendritic cells originating as melanoblasts in the neural crest. Melanoblasts develop in the neural crest; migrate to peripheral sites such as skin, hair follicles, and dermis; differentiate into melanocytes; and synthesize melanosomes and melanin. Genetic mutations affecting any of these steps can lead to hereditary hypopigmentation. Many such mutations have been characterized in the murine model, but this area has been little studied in domestic animals. Many types of exogenous influences, such as inflammation, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, endocrinopathies, autoimmune diseases, and nutritional status can affect melanocytes in the skin, resulting in acquired hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation. Melanin synthesis in melanocytes takes place in melanosomes, which are round or elliptical membrane-bound organelles thought to be derived from endoplasmic reticulum and containing enzymes from the Golgi and lysosomal system. Melanosomes are designated type I through IV, according to their stage of maturation. Type I melanosomes contain no melanin and are electron lucent, whereas type IV are mature melanosomes that are electron dense and migrate to the tips of the dendritic processes to be transferred to adjacent epithelial cells. Melanogenesis in round melanosomes produces eumelanins, the black pigments, and in elliptical melanosomes produces pheomelanins, red and yellow pigments. Pigment types in horses, sheep, goats, and llamas have been analyzed. These melanin pigments arise from the common metabolic pathway of conversion of tyrosine to 3, 4-dihydrophenylalanine (DOPA) and then oxidation to DOPAquinone. Tyrosinase, a copper-containing enzyme, is the critical and rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway, catalyzing tyrosine to DOPA. Many gene products are sequentially important to the melanoblast and melanocyte during their development and maturation. Apart from tyrosinase, the molecular role of these gene products has not been completely characterized, but it appears that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and receptors for fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), endothelin-B, and the Steel factor (cKIT) are crucial.",

Usually pressure induces a protective callus, but in some animals, persistent decubitus ulcers or recurrent hematoma formation eventually lead to the induction of a hygroma. The gross lesion is a variably sized cystic cavity separated from the skin by loose connective tissue. The wall of the hygroma is dense connective tissue that may have a smooth or a villus inner lining. The contents are mucinous and yellow to red, depending on the degree of hemorrhage. Histologically, the wall is composed of granulation tissue of variable maturity. A flattened layer of fibroblasts may give the appearance of an epithelial lining. The cavity may contain clumps of fibrin. Organization of fibrin deposits at the margin of the cavity gives rise to the grossly apparent villus projections that occasionally undergo cartilaginous metaplasia. Decubitus ulcers are the result of ischemic necrosis that follows application of constant pressure to a localized area of skin. Studies in Greyhounds suggest that intermittent repeated focal vascular occlusion leads to increased tissue damage from reperfusion injury. Thromboxane A 2 and its metabolite, thromboxane B 2, are thought to contribute to vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation. Predisposing conditions include prolonged recumbency, lack of proper bedding, improperly applied bandages or casts, poorly fitting tack, atrophy of muscle, loss of fat, malnutrition associated with systemic disease, contusions, irritation from feces or urine, and body types with large bones, thin skin, and low body fat. In large animals, postanesthetic myopathies, laminitis, and neurologic diseases are predisposing conditions. The \"downer\" cow is particularly prone to decubitus ulcers. Decubitus ulcers are graded from I to IV. In grade I, the lesion consists of focal erythema. In grade II, an ulcer extends into the subcutis. In grade III, the ulcer extends into the deep fascia, and the wound edges may be undermined. Grade IV ulcers extend to bone, have undermined edges, and possibly underlying osteomyelitis and septic arthritis.",

In theory, stress causes an increase in the production of endorphins, creating reinforcement of the stereotypic behavior characterizing each syndrome. Psychogenic alopecia in cats, a self-induced form of alopecia precipitated or exacerbated by environmental stress, is similar to the obsessive-compulsive disorder of humans, trichotillomania. Although this condition does occur, it is very rare and generally overdiagnosed. A thorough diagnostic workup is needed to rule out allergic skin disease, ectoparasitism, and other medical causes for pruritus. In a study of 18 cats with presumed psychogenic alopecia, 16 cats were identified with medical causes of pruritus, whereas only 2 cats were found to have only psychogenic alopecia, and 3 cats had a combination of psychogenic alopecia and a medical cause of pruritus. The condition can occur in any cat, but is most common in indoor cats and oriental breeds. Affected cats groom excessively, licking, and pulling at the haircoat. Psychogenic alopecia/dermatitis has 2 clinical forms. In one, psychogenic dermatitis, affected cats lick and chew at a single site, creating a well-demarcated erythematous, ulcerated lesion of variable size, which usually is located on an extremity, the abdomen, or flank. The lesion grossly resembles those of eosinophilic plaque. The second, or alopecic form, is characterized by regional alopecia or hypotrichosis or regions of broken (barbered) hairs and normal skin. A trichogram examination of epilated hairs reveals a normal anagen to telogen ratio and fractured tips of hairs rather than tapered ends. Microscopic examination of skin in the alopecic form is usually normal, although wrinkling of the outer root sheath and intrafollicular deposition are complex and involve such factors as the lower pH of injured tissue, mitochondrial concentration of calcium and phosphorus, and the influx of calcium into injured cells in dystrophic forms. In metastatic forms, loss of mineralization inhibitors, changing of ions into a solid phase, and phosphate ion initiation of crystal formation are implicated in salt formation. Mineralization can be localized, as in inflammatory foci (granulomas), in degenerative lesions (follicular cysts), or in neoplasms (pilomatricomas), or may be generalized as in the tissue mineralization associated with chronic renal failure.",

Secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia may occur as a result of the damage to ciliated epithelia and resultant disturbance of the mucociliary apparatus. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis occurs in acute thallotoxicosis. Focal suppurative pancreatitis has been described in several animals, but its causal relationship to thallium is not established. Ulcerative esophagitis follows dilation secondary to neuronal damage. Lesions in the central nervous system include neuronal chromatolysis, neuronophagia, and severe edema with little glial reaction. Myelinated peripheral nerves have degenerative lesions, including focal distention of myelin sheaths and swelling and occasional fragmentation of axons.",

Differentials for the clinical lesions include superficial necrolytic dermatitis, zinc-responsive dermatosis, generic dog food dermatosis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, mucocutaneous candidiasis, epitheliotropic lymphoma, and autoimmune diseases, such as pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid. The microscopic lesions of thallium toxicosis, zinc-responsive dermatosis, and superficial necrolytic dermatitis are similar, and confirmation requires a compatible history and demonstration of thallium in the urine by the Gabriel-Dubin colorimetric assay or in the stomach content, suspected bait, urine, liver, or kidneys by atomic absorption spectroscopy. rapidly from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and skin. The toxin is disseminated widely in the body and is persistent, being very slowly excreted in bile and urine. The mechanism of toxicity is not fully understood. There are 2 main hypotheses. The first holds that thallium exerts its toxic effect by combining with sulfhydryl groups, a mechanism common to many heavy metals and leading to disruption of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes. The second, which is based on the similarity of ionic radii between thallium and potassium, suggests that thallium may replace potassium in many critical biochemical functions, thus acting as a general cellular poison. The toxic effect may be, in part, the result of thallium interacting adversely with derivatives of riboflavin. Thallium can depolarize nerve cell membranes and antagonize effects of calcium on the heart.",

The pattern of skin involvement in cats and dogs is characteristic, beginning at the commissures of the lips or nasal cleft, occasionally on the ear margins, and expanding over the face and head. The mucous membranes are characteristically \"brick-red\" and may be ulcerated. Lesions also develop on the interdigital skin, footpads, axillae, inguinal areas, perineum, and lateral extensor surfaces. The lesions are marked erythema, scaling, alopecia, exudation, and crusting. The layers of scale-crust exfoliate with attached hairs to leave a raw, oozing surface. The paws often become very swollen. In more chronic cases, thick scales on the footpads resemble \"hard pad\" disease conventionally associated with canine distemper. In less severely affected animals, ease of depilation may be the only clinical indication of thallium poisoning. The pathogenesis of the alopecia is not fully understood. Although thallium enters the hair, as do other heavy metals, by binding to sulfhydryl groups in the keratin, this is unlikely to be destructive to the hair follicle. Thallium may interfere with the energy metabolism of the rapidly dividing matrix cells of anagen follicles. In experimental intoxication of rats, a rapid decline in the mitotic rate is followed by necrosis of the matrix cells within 48 hours. The follicle passes into an abnormal catagen phase, followed by complete involution (telogen). However, no club attachment is formed, and the hairs are rapidly shed. If the animal survives, hair growth is resumed. Thallium also severely alters the cornification process, and both the surface and external root sheath epithelium demonstrate marked parakeratotic hyperkeratosis.",

Gross and histologic cutaneous lesions resembled those of HCN toxicity. Wood shavings containing 4 times the maximal allowable levels of PCP/kg were traced to a lumber company using improper processing techniques. Toxicity was attributed to dibenzofuran and chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin isomers found as contaminants of the PCP. Contaminants of PCP products include a large group of dioxin isomers with a wide range of toxicity that can vary by species exposed and among animals within the species. PCP compounds are used as antiseptics, disinfectants, herbicides, fungicides, and wood and hide preservatives. The toxicity of the herbicide, Agent Orange, widely sprayed in Vietnam, is attributed to dioxin contaminants. The compounds enter the body via oral, dermal, or respiratory routes. High exposure leads to rapid death because of uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Chronic toxicity is more common. The contaminants in the PCP compounds are thought to bind to aromatic hydrocarbon receptors in the cell nucleus and influence gene expression. The response may be proliferative or suppressive. Elevated levels of the compounds can be demonstrated in the liver and adipose tissue years after exposure, whereas serum levels are cleared quickly.

A chronic disease in cattle, known as \"summer slump,\" refers to an increased susceptibility to heat stress seen in certain breeds of cattle in conditions of high environmental temperature combined with intake of endophyte-infected fescue. Cattle have decreased skin temperature and openmouth breathing, suggesting defective thermoregulation. Experimental intravenous injection of alkaloids found in fescue produced lowered skin temperature, heart rate, and prolactin levels, and elevated blood pressure and respiratory rates in heifers. Ingestion of endophyte-infected fescue in horses does not lead to the visibly evident effects of peripheral vasoconstriction as in cattle, but experimental studies have demonstrated that peripheral vasoconstriction does occur, suggesting exposure could lead to foot or leg problems. The more commonly recognized manifestations of fescue toxicosis in the horse are prolonged gestation, agalactia, thickened placentas, and possible abortion. Abdominal lipomatosis associated with marked necrosis of abdominal fat and severe weight loss occurs in domestic ruminants and some species of wildlife consuming endophyte-infected fescue. A heritable predisposition exists in cattle. ",

Initial lesions affect the lips, buccal commissures, and nostrils. Marked edema of the face may follow. Death follows development of hemorrhagic diathesis, enteritis, and septicemia. At autopsy, lesions in addition to the hemorrhagic diathesis include alimentary ulceration, pneumonia, renal infarcts, multifocal hepatic necrosis, and lymphadenitis. In many instances, these lesions may represent secondary mycotic or bacterial involvement. T-2 toxin is a highly irritant trichothecene mycotoxin from Fusarium molds on grain, and causes cutaneous ulceration when applied locally to the skin of pigs. Experimental feeding of T-2 toxin-contaminated feed, in combination with aflatoxin, induces crusting and ulceration of the lips, snout, buccal commissures, and prepuce. The pathogenesis of the lesion is thought to be contact irritant dermatitis due directly to the T-2 toxin or to a urinary metabolite, HT-2 toxin. In rodent studies, topical T-2 toxin induces a cascade of events that leads to oxidative stress and subsequent apoptosis of keratinocytes, with release of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2.",

The most common manifestation, \"fescue foot,\" is a disease of cattle characterized in the acute form by dry gangrene of the extremities commencing 2 weeks after ingestion of the tall fescue grass, Festuca arundinacea. This perennial grass is the most common pasture plant in the United States and is usually harmless. The endophytic fungus Neotyphodium (Acremonium) coenophialum infects ~75% of fescue pastures and imparts increased resistance of the plant to insects and extreme environmental temperatures. Under certain poorly understood conditions, the fed a DUIB-containing diet for 1 month. Histologically, the lesions of the Dutch outbreak also resembled those of the putative hairy vetch toxicity. Visceral lesions resembling hairy vetch toxicity occur in dairy cows fed a diet containing citrus pulp; the syndrome resolves after removal of citrus pulp from the diet. Hairy vetch toxicosis in horses resembles that in cattle, except for the infrequent finding of eosinophils in the infiltrate and lack of heart involvement. Conditions very similar to vetch toxicosis have been reported in horses with no vetch exposure. These cases have been variably referred to as idiopathic granulomatous disease involving the skin, systemic granulomatous disease, generalized granulomatous disease, or equine sarcoidosis. Organ involvement is variable. Skin lesions include scaling, crusting, and alopecia on the face or limbs, and progress to a generalized exfoliative dermatitis. Histologically, the skin has multifocal, sometimes perifollicular to deep dermal nodules of granulomatous inflammation. Sarcoidosis in man has a genetic basis and is thought to represent a hypersensitivity response to a persistent antigen. Equine sarcoidosis is discussed more fully under Miscellaneous skin conditions. Toxicity from vetch seeds is known to be due to the presence of prussic acid. The cause of the granulomatous diseases listed above remains unclear. Nor is it certain whether they represent one entity or a common tissue reaction to a variety of insults. One proposed pathogenesis is that ingestion of vetch or another substance leads to antigen formation in the form of a hapten or a complete antigen that sensitizes lymphocytes and evokes the cell-mediated response upon repeat exposure. Factors that support this hypothesis are the resemblance of the histologic lesions to a type IV hypersensitivity response, age incidence, low morbidity, genetic influence, and possible need for repeat exposure. Lymphocyte blastogenesis and cutaneous hypersensitivity studies have not substantiated this hypothesis; however, only a few vetch antigens have been studied.",

The conditions described below typically affect animals whose anatomic defenses are poor, either by lacking skin pigmentation or hair cover. UVB radiation stimulates light-absorbing molecules in the skin referred to as chromophores. Chromophores include keratin proteins, melanin, carotene, nucleic acids, peptide bonds, and some amino acids, to name a few. Light absorbed by chromophores results in electron transfers and free radical production. Energy dissipated from electron transfers induces chemical reactions to form altered cell components referred to as photoproducts, which include altered DNA molecules, enzymes, and hydrogen and disulfide bonds within proteins. Nucleoprotein is susceptible to UV radiation damage, resulting in mitotic inhibition and, if extensive enough, cell death. Sublethal damage may promote mutagenesis or carcinogenesis by the formation of thymidine dimers between pyrimidine base pairs of DNA. Pyrimidine dimer repair mechanisms normally correct DNA damage prior to cell replication; however, repeated or extensive damage may lead to failure of repair mechanisms and cell transformation. The \"sunburn cell\" associated with UV damage is a keratinocyte that has undergone apoptosis. UVB-induced keratinocyte apoptosis is a complex event that involves cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and probable p53-mediated induction of apoptosis in cells sustaining substantial DNA damage. Studies in mice have shown that UVB radiation-induced apoptotic keratinocytes are replaced by hyperproliferative keratinocytes, leading to epidermal hyperplasia, suggesting that apoptosis and hyperplasia are related events. UV light also induces mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in keratinocytes, contributing to a proliferative advantage to mutated cells that is found in solar-induced actinic keratoses and squamous cell carcinomas in humans. These findings indicate that UV radiation can serve as both a tumor initiator and promoter. UV radiation may also alter immunologic reactivity in favor of the growth of the tumor, through the induction of suppressor T cells and possible impairment of natural killer-cell function. UVB radiation exposure reduces the number of Langerhans cells and impairs their antigen-presenting functions. Contact hypersensitivity responses in experimental animals are reduced following UVB irradiation.",

The quantity of ozone, smog, altitude, latitude, season of the year, and time of day also strongly influence the amount of UV rays reaching the skin. The greatest potential for solarinduced skin damage occurs at high altitudes and temperate latitudes during mid-summer days, and in thin, lightly pigmented, sparsely haired, sun-exposed skin. An increasing prevalence of sun-induced dermatoses and tumors has been noted in humans, coincident with the depletion of the ozone layer and a consequent increase in the intensity of UV radiation reaching the earth's surface.

Sources include plant pigments and drugs or, in the case of metabolic dysfunction, the byproducts of hemoglobin metabolism or chlorophyll degradation products. The 3 categories of photosensitization are classified according to the source of the agents. \u2022 In type I, or primary, photosensitization, the animal ingests plants or drugs containing photoreactive substances that are deposited in the skin. Most exogenous sources of photoreactive pigments are found in plants, and therefore foraging animals, such as horses, sheep, cattle, and goats, are most frequently affected. \u2022 In type II photosensitization, an inherent inability to properly metabolize heme pigments necessary for erythrocyte production leads to the build-up of the photoreactive pigments, hematoporphyrins. \u2022 An abnormal build-up of phylloerythrin, a degradation product of chlorophyll, induces type III photosensitization. This is known also as hepatogenous photosensitization because it depends upon the failure of a damaged or immature liver to eliminate phylloerythrin. Type III photosensitization occurs most often in animals ingesting large amounts of green forage. \u2022 A fourth group contains those examples of photosensitization for which the pathogenesis is presently undetermined.

The relatively hairless skin of the teats, udder, perineum, and muzzle is also affected. The ventral surface of the tongue is frequently affected in cattle if constantly exposed during licking. In sheep, the susceptible sites are the ears, eyelids, face, muzzle, and coronets, although the back may be affected in animals with an open fleece or that have been shorn closely. The udders and teats of dairy goats are predisposed. In horses, lesions are most common on the face, perineum, and distal extremities but may affect any white skin. Lesions in pigs are uncommon, and have a predilection for the ears, eyelids, udder, and back. Photosensitization is rare in dogs and cats, and causative agents remain obscure. proliferation, inhibits apoptosis, and promotes angiogenesis and carcinogenesis. COX-2 expression has been shown in feline, canine, and equine cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Furthermore, use of COX-2 inhibitors may have a therapeutic role in the prevention or management of actinic keratosis and SCC. Solar elastosis, a hallmark of chronic sun exposure in humans, has been described only rarely in dogs, cats, sheep, and horses and essentially represents disorganization of dermal components caused by altered fibroblast function. The lesions usually occur in conjunction with solar radiation-associated neoplasms, particularly SCCs. Solar elastosis appears in H&Estained sections as scattered or agglomerated, thick, irregular, basophilic degenerate elastic fibers . Silver impregnation staining techniques may be needed to demonstrate elastin changes in animals. Solar dermatitis is often present without evidence of elastosis. Solar keratoses, common precancerous skin lesions in humans, occur in cats, dogs, and horses. The conjunctiva of horses with white eyelids is a common site. Histologically, the early lesions have many of the features of sunburn, including epidermal hyperplasia, spongiosis, acute dermal inflammation, and focal necrotic keratinocytes. More chronic lesions show pronounced epidermal hyperplasia with dysplasia, orthokeratotic and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates, and dermal scarring, but seldom develop significant solar elastosis, as typifies human solar keratoses. Lesions frequently progress to invasive SCC. Solar keratoses may also develop cutaneous horns. Differential diagnosis should include other vesicular or necrotizing dermatopathies, including chemical or thermal burns. Establishing the diagnosis is dependent upon anatomic distribution of lesions in nonpigmented, poorly haired, sunexposed regions. Lesions limited to areas of contact, such as the extremities, ventrum, or muzzle, suggests the presence of a contact photosensitizing agent. Multiple affected animals in a herd suggest exposure to a photosensitizing agent rather than a photoallergic reaction. Types I, II, and III photosensitivities can be differentiated by signalment and concurrent clinical signs, such as evidence of liver disease combined with examination of pastures and feedstuffs, and investigating photodynamic drug or chemical exposure. The Candida albicans inhibition assay is a simple, inexpensive, quantitative, and relatively rapid assay for screening plants and feedstuffs for potential primary contact or systemic photosensitizers. The test does not detect all phototoxins. Thin-layer chromatography techniques may be useful in identifying phototoxic compounds. Analysis of suspect vegetation for the identification and quantification of fungal spores may be needed to establish fungal organisms and associated mycotoxins as contributing factors.",

Vesicles or bullae may develop. There is marked exudation and extensive necrosis. Affected skin becomes dry and sloughs in desiccated sheets ( Fig. 6-54 ). Necrosis is frequently seen on the upper surfaces of the ears of sheep; the tips typically curl upward as a result of mummification or may slough entirely. There is swelling of the eyelids and excessive lacrimation. Among the more obscure manifestations of photosensitization is the convulsive reaction of some sheep and cattle, photosensitized by ingestion of St. John's wort, on contact with cold water. Icterus typically is associated with hepatogenous photosensitization, but hepatogenous photosensitization may occur in its absence. Economic losses in livestock can be severe due to damaged hides, weight loss, fly strikes, secondary infections, and reluctance of animals to let the young nurse damaged udders. In severe episodes of photosensitization, animals may die. This is more often the result of concomitant damage to other organs, particularly the liver, than to cutaneous damage alone.

Phenothiazine photosensitization occurs most commonly in calves but also in sheep, swine, and birds. Pigs develop cutaneous lesions more frequently than sheep or cattle, probably because the activating radiation is more able to penetrate the integument.

This applies equally to nutritional diseases and to diseases of other causes. Many systemic diseases result in cutaneous changes. The general metabolic transformations that take place in the skin are not qualitatively different from those in other tissues, but there are some quantitative differences, such as the high requirements and turnover of sulfur-containing amino acids in the elaboration of keratin. In most metabolic disturbances and deficiencies of essential nutrients, whether from dietary lack, malabsorption, the action of antimetabolites, or the body's inability to properly absorb or use nutrients, changes will be reflected in the skin. The molecular basis for these skin lesions is, however, poorly understood. There are only a few syndromes that occur naturally and are sufficiently clearly defined to warrant discussion here. A larger number can be occurs provided the animal is on a chlorophyll-rich diet and is exposed to sufficient solar radiation of the appropriate wavelength. High ambient solar radiation and lack of shade are contributing factors. Photosensitization tends to occur most often when the hepatic damage is generalized, even if mild. Severe focal necrotizing lesions of the liver generally do not cause photosensitization because there is enough hepatic reserve to remove the phylloerythrin from the circulation. The cause of hepatic damage may be a plant toxin, mycotoxin, infectious agent, or chemical. Toxic plants and mycotoxins account for most cases of hepatogenous photosensitization. A few of the many plants implicated in hepatotoxic photosensitization include lantana (Lantana camara), bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), Tribulus terrestris, Agave lecheguilla, Nolina texana, Cymadothea trifolii-infested clover, Trifolium hybridum (\"alsike clover poisoning\"), and Panicum spp. grasses, such as kleingrass (Panicum coloratum). Kleingrass is a perennial grass forage crop with a toxic principle suspected to be a saponin. Cases of kleingrass induced-photosensitization are sporadic, potentially related to environmental conditions and have been reported in Australia, Africa, and Texas.

Experimental studies demonstrated an increase in epidermal DNA synthesis and a decrease in prostaglandin E and F levels in the skin of essential fatty aciddeficient mice. The lower prostaglandin levels likely reflect a lack of precursor arachidonic acid. Deficiency of prostaglandin E 2 could influence epidermal cell kinetics through its effect on ratios of cyclic AMP to guanosine monophosphate (GMP). Supplementation of animal diets with balanced omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids is thought to modulate arachidonic acid metabolism and subsequent production of leukotrienes and prostaglandins that, in turn, may influence epidermal turnover kinetics and the inflammatory response. A seborrheic dermatosis in cats, characterized by dry scaly skin and alopecia, is responsive to fatty acid supplementation but is not likely to be the result of a true deficiency. Experimental essential fatty acid deprivation in cats produces dry, scaly coats. Diets containing linoleic acid and linolenic acids as the sole source of essential fatty acids also induce a seborrheic dermatosis. Cats are obligate carnivores, as they lack delta-6-desaturase, the enzyme responsible for converting these 18-carbon fatty acids to longer-chain fatty acids.

Hypotrichosis develops as a thinning of the hair rather than baldness, and seasonal shedding may cease or be prolonged. Lesions may be symmetrical on the head and trunk and spread to the limbs. The skin may atrophy, or hyperkeratosis, hyperpigmentation, and possibly loss of hair pigmentation develop. The histopathologic findings in the skin may mimic an endocrinopathy, with severe epidermal and adnexal atrophy, orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, and telogenization of hair follicles. In pigs, the skin often becomes hyperkeratotic and assumes a dirty, dry appearance, and the hair becomes long and shaggy. The skin of a malnourished animal has an increased susceptibility to bacterial infection and parasitic infestations and their effects. Under-nutrition of the pregnant ewe, between 115-135 days of gestation, decreases the number of secondary wool follicles in the developing fetus. Most experimental work on the effects of nutrition on hair growth has been performed in sheep, the purpose being either to improve wool production or to investigate chemical methods of shearing. Changing sheep from a lowprotein to a high-protein diet led to a 33% increase in fleece production, attributed mostly to an increase in the rate of mitosis in the hair bulb. Specific amino acid deficiencies have been investigated as potential replacements for mechanical shearing as wool production is highly dependent upon levels of certain amino acids, specifically cysteine.",

Alopecia was largely due to a fleece in which individual fibers were thin, weak, and straight. Histologically and ultrastructurally, the wool fibers had reduced numbers of cortical cells. Histochemical stains showed a delay in the incorporation and oxidation of sulfhydryl groups. Supplementation with B-group vitamins partially restored the fleece.

Zinc-responsive dermatosis in dogs is discussed in the next section. In the integument, a substantial proportion of zinc is in the wool or the haircoat. Zinc is a component of many important metalloenzymes and is a cofactor for many others. It exerts its primary effect through zincdependent enzymes that regulate RNA and DNA metabolism. Zinc thus plays a role in all metabolic processes involved with tissue growth, maturation, and repair, and is involved in vitamin A metabolism and in enzymes needed for free radical scavenging. Zinc also modulates many aspects of the immune and inflammatory responses. The relationship between the changes in particular tissue enzyme activities brought about by zinc deficiency and clinical manifestations of the deficiency syndrome are not, however, well understood. Zinc is known to have an inhibitory effect on apoptotic pathways. The parakeratosis seen in cases of zinc deficiency and zinc-responsive dermatosis may be related to decreased activity of zinc-related lytic enzymes along with increased epidermal cell turnover, which results in failure of nuclear hydrolysis. Zinc deficiency causes anorexia, alterations in food use, growth retardation, reproductive disorders, depression of the Vitamin C-responsive dermatosis has been described in two10-week-old dairy calves.

Lesions comprise scaling and crusting dermatitis with a predilection for the face, particularly around the eyes, lips and nose, pressure points, and footpads ( Fig. 6-57A ). Lesions may be unilateral initially and progress to a bilateral distribution. Pruritus may be present. Secondary pyoderma is not uncommon. The pathogenesis of the syndrome is not well established. Alaskan Malamutes with chondrodysplasia have zinc-responsive spermatozoal defects and reduced zinc absorption from the intestinal tract; malabsorption may be responsible for the dermatologic disease. Lifetime supplementation of zinc is necessary to alleviate signs. A severe form of zinc-responsive dermatosis has been documented in a litter of Pharaoh Hounds. A role for oxidative stress has been shown in cases of canine zinc-responsive dermatosis.

The first episode occurs at approximately 4 years of age but can be variable. In the Northern Hemisphere, the onset of alopecia is usually between November and March. There is spontaneous hair regrowth after 3-8 months; however, occasional dogs have progressively less hair regrowth after each episode. Rare dogs fail to regrow hair after the first episode; and some dogs have one episode of alopecia that never recurs. Clinically, the bilaterally symmetrical lesions are usually confined to the thoracolumbar regions, have well-demarcated margins with abrupt transition from affected to unaffected skin, and are usually hyperpigmented ( Fig. 6-63A ). Histologic changes are those of noninflammatory, nonscarring follicular atrophy. Follicular infundibula are dilated and filled with keratin that can extend into the openings of the primary and secondary atrophic follicles, giving the appearance of an inverted footprint over the remnants of the follicular epithelium ( Fig. 6-63B ).

There are bodies of evidence that stress the \"outside in\" theory that begins with an abnormal skin barrier that results in a pathologic immune response, as opposed to the \"inside out\" theory that focuses on immunologic aberrations that result in skin disease. The strong link between an abnormal skin barrier and AD is corroborated by investigations into the genetics of ichthyosis vulgaris (IV). Individuals with IV are homozygous for mutations in the filaggrin gene. Heterozygous relatives are clinically normal but predisposed to AD and atopic asthma. Although filaggrin is not the only predisposing cause of atopic disease, loss of function mutations are present in about 10% of the population in Western Europe. During cornification, profilaggrin, located within keratohyaline granules of the stratum granulosum, is dephosphorylated to filaggrin. Filaggrin serves to anneal keratin intermediate filaments to form the strong central corneocyte core. Degradation products of filaggrin (e.g., urcanic acid) act as a natural moisturizing factor for the stratum corneum (SC). Even subtle defects in the organization or composition of the SC enable transepidermal allergen penetration and sensitization. Humans with AD have xerosis (dry skin), which is a result of increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and impairment of the water-holding capacity of the skin. In dogs, there is only limited evidence of an association between filaggrin and canine atopic dermatitis (CAD). Mutations in the filaggrin gene FLG do not appear to play a role in the development of CAD, although altered filaggrin expression may be present. There is reasonable evidence that dogs with CAD have an altered skin barrier: deranged lipid profiles in the SC (e.g., decreased free ceramides), exposure when mast cells bearing allergen-specific IgE bind allergen and release a variety of preformed mediators, most notably histamine. The skin histamine content has been found to be increased in humans and dogs with AD. Activated mast cells also release cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and platelet-activating factor (PAF), that further promote inflammation. An IgE-dependent late-phase reaction develops subsequently when expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules on postcapillary venule endothelium promotes influx of eosinophils, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells into the skin. Eosinophils release various mediators, including PAF, eosinophil major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and cytokines that promote inflammation and cause tissue damage. Antigen-specific IgE antibodies also appear to be involved in a nonclassic role in antigen uptake and processing. IgE-bearing antigen-presenting cells (APCs), particularly Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells, bind, process, and present specific antigen locally to allergen-specific indeterminate T cells (Th0), thereby directing them to the Th2-cell phenotype. Moreover, IgEmediated antigen presentation increases the presenting capacity of these APCs up to 100-fold, a mechanism known as \"facilitated antigen presentation.\" Ultimately, B cells are stimulated to produce more allergen-specific IgE, which is bound to antigen-presenting cells, and a vicious cycle of facilitated antigen presentation is perpetuated.",

Tissue-selective homing of T cells is thought to be regulated at the level of T-cell recognition of vascular endothelial cells via interaction of differentially expressed T lymphocyte homing receptors, such as cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA), and their endothelial cell ligands. Therefore it seems likely that the elevated expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells promotes migration of increased numbers of CLA+ T cells into the skin. The tendency to develop AD, as opposed to asthma or allergic rhinitis, may depend on differences in the memory/effector T cells that are specialized to home to the skin versus lung. Furthermore, cytokines released by Th2 cells (e.g., IL-31) appear to incite pruritus. IL-31 activates Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak/STAT) pathways in a broad range of immune cells, and receptors for IL-31 are also found on keratinocytes.

The balance between Th1 and Th2 cells may be modulated by biochemical defects in monocytes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of individuals with AD have been shown to have increased activity of phosphodiesterase, which results in increased monocyte prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) production. PGE 2 tends to inhibit Th1 production of IFN-\u03b3 and accentuate secretion by Th2 cells.

One hypothesis to explain the etiology of CAD begins with a defective skin barrier. For decades, allergic inhalant dermatitis was ingrained prominently in the veterinary literature as the consequence of an allergic reaction triggered by inhaled aeroallergens. There is strong evidence that transdermal exposure is more important, which predisposes to allergen penetration and sensitization. In dogs, transdermal exposure correlates with the distribution of lesions on sparsely haired areas (i.e., paws, ventrum, flexural folds). Allergens are captured by high-affinity receptors for IgE (Fc\u03b5R1) receptors on Langerhans cells that process and present antigen to T lymphocytes. Atopic dogs and cats have increased and often aggregated Langerhans cells within the epidermis. Moreover, there are increased T cells in the epidermis, and the dermis contains clusters of perivascular dendritic cells. Functionally, these findings correlate with antigen capture by Langerhans cells (dendritic cells in the epidermis) and enhanced antigen presentation by dendritic cells to lymphocytes. The cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is innately released by activated keratinocytes and serves as a potent activator of dermal dendritic cells.

Dogs with AD have higher levels of anti-staphylococcal IgE than non-atopic dogs. Multidrug resistance to S. pseudintermedius is not uncommon in dogs that have received multiple antibiotic courses. Staphylococcus aureus in humans is believed to augment allergen-induced skin inflammation in AD by secreting exotoxins that act as superantigens. Superantigens have the capacity to activate large numbers of T cells nonspecifically by virtue of their ability to bridge the linkage between the class II major histocompatibility complex molecule on the antigen-presenting cell (APC) and certain classes of the T-cell receptor without having to be processed and presented by the APC.

Urticaria is most common in horses, uncommon in dogs, and rare in ruminants, pigs, and cats. Angioedema is rare. A wide variety of immunologic and nonimmunologic causes have been implicated, but frequently the specific causative agent cannot be determined for a particular individual. Immunologic causes of urticaria/angioedema are thought to involve type I hypersensitivity reactions primarily; type III hypersensitivity is involved occasionally. Recognized initiators in all species include foods and food additives, drugs, biological agents, stinging and biting arthropods, intestinal parasites, inhalant and contact allergens, and bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. Nonimmunologic factors associated with urticaria/angioedema include physical factors such as heat, cold, or pressure; mast cell degranulating agents such as radiocontrast media; and agents that result in perturbation of arachidonic acid metabolism. Deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor is a genetic cause of chronic urticaria in humans. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, psychologic stress, and concurrent febrile illness may be exacerbating factors, if not causative ones, in humans with chronic urticaria. Another cause of chronic urticaria identified in humans is IgG autoantibody directed against the IgE receptor of cutaneous mast cells and circulating basophils. Binding of the autoantibody to this receptor induces release of histamine. T-helper 2 cytokines, eosinophils, mast cells, and macrophages have been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of equine recurrent urticaria. Regardless of cause, the final common pathway is increased vascular permeability and resultant edema produced by histamine, the major mediator, and possibly also by kinins, eicosanoids, and neuropeptides. Drugs are probably the most frequent cause of urticaria in horses. A wide variety of systemic drugs and biological products have been implicated in initiating urticaria. Wheals frequently develop in minutes to hours after exposure to the offending drug and usually subside within several hours. Cholinergic or heat-reflex urticaria, induced by exercise or a hot bath, has been reported in a horse; pruritus in this horse appeared to be exacerbated by pelleted feed. An unusual form of urticaria called dermatographism, which is induced by blunt pressure to the skin, has also been described in the horse. In some instances, urticaria is thought to be caused by overfeeding of grains, especially those high in protein content (\"protein bumps,\" \"feed bumps\"). Lesions occur anywhere on the body but are most common on the face, neck, and thorax. In cattle, a unique form of urticaria has been described in highproducing dairy cows, especially Jerseys and Guernseys, that become sensitized to casein in their own milk (milk allergy).

Furthermore, CARF may affect 12-16% of cats with pruritus and 10% of cats with military dermatitis. No breed or sex predilection is apparent. Most cases are recognized in young adult cats. The major complaint is severe pruritus that is usually nonseasonal and frequently poorly responsive to glucocorticoid therapy. The face, ears, and neck are most commonly involved, but pruritus may be generalized ( Fig. 6-66 ). Allergens identified include fish, lamb, milk, whale meat, beef, chicken, rabbit, eggs, and pork. Food-allergic cats may also have other hypersensitivity conditions, such as AD or flea-bite allergy. Skin lesions are extremely variable and include erythema, angioedema-urticaria, selfinduced alopecia and excoriations, crusting, seborrhea, or Food allergy in humans is thought to develop as a consequence of physiologic and immunologic immaturity, resulting in increased absorption of food antigens during early life in association with the inherited tendency for increased production of IgE antibody. Absorption of intact food proteins is limited by the intestinal mucosal barrier and by combination of the proteins with food allergen-specific IgA secreted into the gut. However, adult levels of IgA are not generally produced until puberty, and this relative IgA deficiency may contribute to increased permeability of the gastrointestinal barrier during childhood. Gastrointestinal infections and parasitism may also contribute to disruption of the mucosal barrier to increase absorption of food antigens. The majority of food allergens are glycoproteins molecular weight 10,000-80,000 Da, which tend to be resistant to proteolysis and are heat stable and water soluble. Even in the mature intestine, ~2% of ingested food antigens are absorbed into the circulation in an immunologic form. However, these immunologically recognizable proteins do not normally cause adverse reactions despite being transported throughout the body because tolerance develops in most individuals. Tolerance is thought to involve activation of CD8+ T suppressor cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) to suppress an immune response. The development of tolerance to food appears to have little effect on B cells, given that antibody production to food proteins is a universal phenomenon; although low concentrations of serum IgG, IgM, and IgA food-specific antibodies are found in normal individuals, they are of no clinical consequence. In genetically predisposed infants, however, ingested antigens result in excessive production of IgE antibodies. These foodspecific antibodies bind high-affinity receptors on mast cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages in tissues and basophils in circulation. When food allergens penetrate mucosal barriers and reach the IgE bound to mast cells and basophils, mediators are released that induce the signs of immediate hypersensitivity. Activated mast cells also generate various mediators (such as IL-4, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and plateletactivating factor) that may induce an IgE-mediated late-phase response in which eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes are attracted to the site of reaction and release additional inflammatory mediators and cytokines that drive a Th2mediated response. The development of dermatitis rather than respiratory signs in individuals with food allergy may be related to homing of allergen-specific T cells to the skin by way of cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA), a homing molecule that directs these cells to the skin.",

Although signs may initially develop in young animals, CARF is typically a disease of adult animals, and no loss of clinical sensitivity has been observed in affected animals.

            "text": "Allergic contact dermatitis is caused by contact with a nonirritating concentration of a substance to which an individual has previously become sensitized. The compounds involved are usually lipid-soluble haptens (low-molecular-weight substances) that become immunogenic only after penetrating the epidermis and binding covalently to an autologous structural or cell surface protein to form a complete antigen. This antigen is subsequently internalized and processed by Langerhans cells and presented to CD4+ T cells. Langerhans cells are crucial to development of allergic contact dermatitis, as depletion of these cells results in a decreased ability to induce contact sensitization. During the induction phase of the reaction, Langerhans cells present antigen to CD4+ cells in the paracortical region of regional lymph nodes, where the specifically sensitized T cells undergo clonal expansion and then circulate as memory cells in blood and home to skin by virtue of adhesion molecules that bind to addressins on endothelial cells. Development of allergic contact dermatitis depends on the nature of the allergen, frequency of contact, and state of the skin. Factors that damage the integrity of the protective barrier of the skin predispose to development of allergic contact dermatitis. The induction phase is typically a prolonged process, estimated to require 6-24 months to develop. Although strong immunogens can elicit sensitivity after as short a period of contact as 7-21 days, most contact allergens are weaker immunogens and require chronic repeated exposure for sensitization to develop. Upon subsequent exposure to the contact allergen, specifically sensitized T cells in skin and circulation are presented the antigen by Langerhans cells (elicitation phase), become activated, and elaborate various cytokines that attract and activate other inflammatory cells and stimulate proliferation of the epidermis. Only a very small fraction (<1%) of the infiltrating T cells are specific for a relevant antigen. Thus various amplification and recruitment mechanisms are involved in induction of the reactions. The activated T cells secrete a Th1 profile of cytokines, including interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and TNF-\u03b2, which recruit and activate a wide variety of inflammatory cells, affect keratinocyte function and differentiation, and induce expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and keratinocytes. TNF-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 induce expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on keratinocytes and endothelium, which promotes homing of T cells to the dermis and epidermis. Unlike the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that develops in response to antigen injected into the dermis, which primarily involves CD4+ cells, the response to hapten painted on the epidermis involves both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Local production of cytokines induces arrival of more T cells and further amplification of proinflammatory mechanisms. Irritated keratinocytes also release a variety of cytokines that induce or augment the inflammatory response.",

The most common manifestation is multiple erythematous pruritic papules covered by brown crust (\"miliary dermatitis\") on the dorsal lumbosacral area, flanks, caudal and medial aspect of the thighs, ventral abdomen, and neck. In some cats, the condition may be manifested as overzealous grooming rather than scratching, producing alopecia that may be ventral abdominal, bilaterally symmetrical along the lateral aspect of the trunk, or dorsal lumbosacral. The skin may appear completely normal grossly, or excoriations, crusts, scales, and hyperpigmented macules may be seen. Fleas or flea dirt may not be evident because of the fastidious grooming behavior typical of most cats. Eosinophilic granuloma complex lesions have also been associated with flea-bite hypersensitivity in cats. Secondary bacterial pyoderma is uncommon. Differential diagnosis is extensive because the manifestations of flea allergy are so varied in cats. The most common differentials for miliary dermatitis include other hypersensitivity conditions (AD, food hypersensitivity), dermatophytosis, and cheyletiellosis.

The condition is characterized by intense pruritus that develops or is exacerbated near the time of estrus or pseudopregnancy but tends to become more severe and protracted with each episode; pruritus is generally perennial in male dogs. Bilaterally symmetrical erythema and crusted papules typically begin in the dorsal lumbosacral, perineal, genital, and caudomedial thigh areas and progress cranially. In chronic cases, the condition is generalized, and the skin becomes alopecic and lichenified. Pruritus is usually unresponsive to glucocorticoid treatment.

The pathomechanism is unknown, but a type I hypersensitivity reaction has been proposed. Ascarids, coccidia, hookworms, tapeworms, and whipworms have rarely been associated with pruritic dermatoses that resolve with elimination of the intestinal parasites. Lesions that have been attributed to intestinal parasite hypersensitivity include multifocal or generalized papulocrustous eruptions, pruritic seborrheic disease, pruritic urticaria, and pruritus without skin lesions. The histologic changes described are superficial perivascular dermatitis with variable numbers of eosinophils, ranging from few to many. Diagnosis is based on fecal examination and resolution of the skin lesions following appropriate parasiticidal therapy. Affected horses may scratch and bite themselves and rub objects in their environment, thereby causing damage to themselves, their riders, and environmental objects. Constant anxiety and restlessness may prevent severely affected animals from performing as riding or show animals. Also, because sweating exacerbates pruritus, affected horses cannot be worked vigorously. The differential diagnoses include ectoparasitism and other hypersensitivity dermatoses. The diagnosis is based on seasonality of the condition, location and appearance of lesions, sporadic occurrence of the condition in a group, eliminating other diseases, and response to therapy. The histologic lesions of Culicoides hypersensitivity are typically superficial or superficial and deep perivascular dermatitis consisting of eosinophils and lymphocytes primarily.

Pemphigus refers to a group of autoimmune skin diseases characterized clinically by pustules, vesicles, bullae, erosions, and ulcers and histologically by loss of adhesion between cells (acantholysis). Autoantibodies directed against antigens within stratified squamous epithelia, including haired skin, mucocutaneous junctions, oral and genital mucosa, and esophagus, develop and can be detected via immunologic assays. Classic pemphigus in humans is divided into pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus. The clinical phenotypes correlate with the autoantibody profile in the skin. Autoantibodies are directed against components of keratinocyte transmembrane glycoproteins (i.e., extracellular domains of desmoglein 1 or desmoglein 3) that are responsible for keratinocyte cell-to-cell adherence. The autoantibodies cause loss of cohesion between keratinocytes (acantholysis) and blister formation. In pemphigus vulgaris, blisters occur in the lower layers of the epidermis (suprabasilar), where the antibody targets desmoglein-3, the predominant antigen at this location on mucous membranes. Pemphigus foliaceus lesions occur only on haired skin, and the antibody targets desmoglein-1, which resides in upper layers of the epidermis. Pemphigus vulgaris can have both mucous membrane and haired skin involvement if there is concurrent autoantibody formation to desmoglein-1. IgG autoantibodies can also occur in humans with paraneoplastic pemphigus.",

Activation of plasminogen may indirectly induce the cleaving of intercellular contacts. Anti-uPA antibodies or the specific inhibitor of uPA, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2, inhibit lesion formation in vitro.

Their characteristic microscopic lesions, combined with clinical information and careful interpretation of ancillary studies, often enable a specific diagnosis to be made. In the vast majority of cases, the stimulus triggering the aberrant T-or B-cell responses against self-antigens is unknown. Drug therapy, underlying neoplasia (see Paraneoplastic pemphigus), tissue injury, infectious diseases, other autoimmune diseases, and genetic makeup are all factors known to be associated with the occurrence of autoimmune diseases. Penicillinamine, for example, may precipitate clinically, histologically, and immunologically classic cases of pemphigus in humans, which regress when the drug is withdrawn. Drug-induced forms of pemphigus are thought to be the result of haptenization of keratinocyte antigens, rendering them immunogenic. One theory suggests environmental agents, such as drugs, influence T cells by causing DNA methylation abnormalities that, in turn, alter gene expression. Exposure to ultraviolet light is known to exacerbate cutaneous autoimmune disease, perhaps by inducing keratinocyte intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression and keratinocyte production of proinflammatory cytokines. Still another theory suggests that the structural similarities of peptide fragments of some infectious agents to host proteins may trigger postinfectious autosensitization. The recognition that one autoimmune disease, tissue injury, inflammatory or neoplastic process in an individual may precede the onset of cutaneous autoimmune disease led to investigation of the phenomenon termed epitope spreading. Epitope spreading refers to the process by which the targets of the autoimmune response do not remain fixed but drift to include other epitopes on the same protein or nearby proteins of the same tissue. This may account for regional variations in pemphigus antigen expression and the clinical variation of cutaneous autoimmune diseases. Epitope spreading may also account for aberrant immune responses developing to tissue antigens after the tissue has been injured, possibly leading to the release or exposure of a previously sequestered antigen.",

Demonstration of autoantibodies does not necessarily confirm causative roles for these antibodies, just as negative results do not necessarily exclude the diagnosis of a cutaneous autoimmune disease.

Either neutrophils or eosinophils may predominate. At the base of the pustule, acantholytic keratinocytes continue to detach and enter the pustule. Ruptured pustules form a thick inflammatory crust in which acantholytic cells are prominent. The external root sheath of the hair follicle undergoes a similar acantholytic process. Dermal infiltrates consist of mild A B between the stratum basale and the stratum spinosum ( Fig.  6-71B ). The basal keratinocytes, although separated from each other following disruption of intercellular contacts, are anchored to the basal lamina resembling a \"row of tombstones.\" The outer layers of the epidermis form the roof of the vesicle that may contain a few acantholytic keratinocytes, singly or in clumps, but few or no inflammatory cells. The process may extend into the hair follicle epithelium. The dermal reaction in haired skin varies from a mild superficial perivascular to interstitial accumulation of mononuclear cells and eosinophils. A moderately intense lymphocytic-plasmacytic interface infiltrate may be present in mucosal lesions. Clinical differentials include mucous membrane pemphigoid, erythema multiforme, bullous pemphigoid, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vesicular lupus erythematosus of Collies and Shetland Sheepdogs, mycosis fungoides, and other diseases resulting in oral ulcers. Histopathologic findings of primary lesions in PV are diagnostic. Acantholytic cells are more numerous and can more often be found in rafts in PF than in superficial folliculitis. The \"cling-on\" stratum granulosum cells are only present in PF. In PF, pustules also span the interfollicular epidermis encompassing multiple follicles, whereas in superficial folliculitis pustules are more likely to be centered on single follicles. Evidence of recornification and reformation of pustules is often prominent in PF. Dermatophytosis and superficial pyoderma (impetigo) can also have similar gross and histologic lesions. Careful examination of skin sections with fungal and bacterial stains and possibly cultures may be needed for differentiation. Impetigo does not involve hair follicles, whereas PF may. Pemphigus erythematosus (PE) and pemphigus vegetans are terms that have been loosely applied to veterinary diseases based on human comparisons. Further studies suggest the conditions are not directly comparable. Criteria for diagnosis and differentiation from PF were dependent upon the immunologic demonstration of both a diffuse cell surface IF or IHC pattern typical of the pemphigus group and a linear band of immunoglobulin, with or without complement, deposited at the basement membrane zone. For reasons stated previously, IF and IHC are not dependable. Pemphigus erythematosus is a poorly characterized facially oriented PF in dogs and cats. It is unclear if PE is indeed different from PF, a localized variant of PF, or if the disease is a crossover between discoid lupus and PF. Reported cases of pemphigus vegetans in veterinary patients are very limited and originally thought to be benign variants of pemphigus vulgaris. A documented case of pemphigus vegetans has been reported in a Greater Swiss Mountain dog. The dog had verrucous superficial PF pustules/crust and deep epidermal pemphigus vulgaris lesions. Panepidermal pustular pemphigus (PPP) is a term previously used to describe a deep epidermal form of pemphigus in the dog that encompassed some of the features of pemphigus foliaceus, pemphigus vegetans, and pemphigus erythematosus. PPP is now thought to be a histologic variant of PF.",

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease characterized clinically by vesicles, bullae, and ulcers, and histologically by subepidermal vesicles/ bullae containing eosinophils or other leukocytes.

In animals, only BPAG2 has been identified. The mechanism of dermoepidermal separation is thought to be the result of the release of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, and others by keratinocytes altered by antigen-antibody interactions.

Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is a subepidermal blistering disease characterized by vesicle formation in areas of concurrent neutrophilic superficial dermatitis. The condition has been reported in dogs and humans. Circulating and tissue-bound autoantibodies targeting the distal end of anchoring fibrils in the sub-lamina densa of the lower basement membrane zone have been demonstrated using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. The actual target antigen has been shown to be the amino-terminal globular noncollagenous domain of type VII collagen. Clinical lesions in the dog are characterized by erythematous and urticarial eruption with vesicles, bullae, or ulcerations arising in areas subject to friction, including oral ulcerations. Histologically, dermoepidermal separation is present in association with marked neutrophilic inflammation in the superficial dermis and within vesicles and bullae. Too few cases have been documented to provide information regarding triggering events or clinical outcome. Differentials include those listed for BP. Olivry Although Collies are supposedly predisposed to BP, the disease process would currently be classified as cutaneous vesicular lupus erythematosus.

One confirmed BP case was documented in 3-year-old dog with vesicles and erosions on the prepuce, trunk, face, and paws. The dogs was documented with IgG autoantibodies that targeted BPAG2 (XVII collagen). BP has been documented in horses and Yucatan minipigs. In horses, the lesions are often generalized with marked sloughing of the oral mucosa and signs of systemic illness. Lesions on the rump and back characterize the disease in Yucatan minipigs.

Early in life, these dogs develop widespread skin lesions (scaling, erythema, erosions/ulcers, pigment loss) as well as variable lethargy and lameness. The inheritance is autosomal recessive and maps to canine chromosome 18. All dogs generally develop lesions by 6 months of age. The clinical and histologic features are diagnostic. The lesions are not solar associated. This first manifestation is adherent scale on the dorsal muzzle (Fig. 6-73 ). This is followed by erythema, with progression to hair loss, pigment alterations, erosions, and ulcers. As the lesions change, the distribution becomes truncal and involves the scrotum (often severe), limbs, and ears. The collar area is generally spared. The dogs are generally nonpruritic. Biopsies of peripheral lymph nodes reveal reactive lymphoid hyperplasia; nodes are often palpably enlarged before the onset of severe skin lesions. The dogs have consistent mild lymphopenia and hyperproteinemia, with some dogs having A B reaction. Thus drug eruption can mimic virtually any dermatosis. Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and vasculitis are well-recognized dermatoses that can be manifestations of cutaneous drug eruptions and are described individually later in this section. Criteria for establishing a cutaneous reaction as a confirmed drug eruption include (1) elimination of other causes of the skin lesions, (2) timing of onset of reaction with administration of a suspect drug, (3) improvement upon drug withdrawal, (4) recognition that the suspect drug has been associated with similar reactions in other animals or species in the past, and (5) recurrence of lesions upon rechallenge of the patient with the drug. Understandably, all 5 of these criteria are not often met, particularly rechallenge as this can be associated with high morbidity or mortality. The time period between drug administration and onset of an adverse reaction varies widely from hours to months, and lesions can result from a single or repeated administration. Drug-induced gross and histologic lesions are not pathognomonic for an adverse cutaneous drug eruption, although histopathologic changes may often point to a limited list of differentials. Histologic patterns that have been recognized as forms of adverse drug reactions include urticaria, perivascular dermatitis (allergy-like), hydropic and/or lichenoid interface dermatitis (erythema multiforme, TEN, lupus erythematosus-like), perforating folliculitis, vasculitis, intraepidermal vesiculopustular dermatitis (pemphigus-like), and subepidermal bullous reactions (pemphigoid-like).

Diethylcarbamazine and 5-fluorocytosine have been associated with fixed-drug eruption on the scrotum of dogs. The ulcerative lesions healed with hyperpigmentation when the drug was withdrawn but recrudescence at the same site, with vesiculation, occurred when the dog was rechallenged. The mechanism underlying fixed-drug eruption is unknown. In humans, the epidermal invasion of T cells in fixed-drug eruptions is associated with the expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on the surface of lesional keratinocytes. In dogs, cyclosporine has been reported to cause a lichenoid lymphoplasmacytic dermatitis as well as cutaneous papillomas and viral plaques.

            "text": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurs as a complication of bone marrow transplantation. It has been recorded in humans, dogs, cats, and horses. The disease results from donor T-lymphocyte responses to recipient histocompatibility antigens in the acute phase, and from immunocompetent recipient lymphocyte responses to transplantation antigens in the chronic phase. Principal target organs are the skin, liver, and intestinal tract. GVHD is considered the classic example of cell-mediated attack upon the epidermis. Proposed target cells in the skin include basal keratinocytes, follicular stem cells, and/or Langerhans cells. Studies indicate both CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes are active in the disease process, with CD8+ T cells found more often in the epidermis and CD4+ T cells in the dermal infiltrate. Natural killer (NK) cells may also play a role. T-cell production of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) results in keratinocyte expression of ICAM-1, the binding molecule for lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) found on infiltrating T cells. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) production by activated keratinocytes and Langerhans cells and IFN-\u03b3 lead to keratinocyte production of IL-8 attracting more lymphocytes. Skin lesions in the acute phase include generalized erythematous macules, multifocal alopecia, and ulcerative dermatitis. Oral lesions, epidermal detachment, and follicular papules may be present. In the chronic phase, erythema, irregular hyperpigmentation, dermal fibrosis, cutaneous atrophy, and cicatricial alopecia from chronic ulceration may occur. Histologic findings include various degrees of hydropic and/or lichenoid interface dermatitis with marked lymphocytic satellitosis of necrotic keratinocytes in all layers of the epidermis and the follicular epithelium. There are lymphocytic exocytosis and spongiosis. Dermal lymphocytic infiltrate is variable. Dermal-epidermal cleft or ulceration may also be present. Over time, epidermal atrophy and dermal sclerosis with loss of adnexa may occur. Basal layer vacuolation and inflammation persist. Differential diagnoses include erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal described in cats treated with ampicillin or cimetidine and dogs receiving trimethoprim-sulfonamide. Lesions consisted of classic subcorneal pustules with acantholytic cells, with an additional feature of vasculitis in some cases. Systemic lupuslike drug reactions have been reported in dogs and in cats. Cutaneous vasculitis caused by immune complex deposition may be initiated by drug administration. Sulfadiazine administration in Doberman Pinschers causes a poorly defined skin rash as well as ocular, joint, kidney, and hematologic abnormalities suggestive of systemic vasculitis.

A monoclonal cryoglobulinemia associated with multiple myeloma has been reported in a cat. Lead exposure and hemobartonellosis (Mycoplasma haemofelis) have also been implicated as predisposing factors in dogs and cats. Cryopathy caused by cryofibrinogens and cryoglobulins has also been reported in the dog. Cutaneous signs associated with cryopathies result from vascular insufficiency (obstruction, stasis, spasm, and thrombosis) . Lesions include erythema, purpura, cyanosis, necrosis, ulceration, and occasionally sloughing of extremities, and are precipitated or exacerbated by exposure to cold. The paws, pinnae, nose, and tip of the tail are typically involved.

The histologic lesions, cellular infiltrates and types of lymphocytes present mirror that of GVHD, lending further support for a cell-mediated immune response. One study of GVHD and EM in dogs revealed similar populations of CD4 and CD8+ cells. In humans, the pathogenesis of herpesvirusassociated EM (HAEM) is thought to be markedly different from SJS/TEN. In HAEM, viral proteins on the surface of keratinocytes provoke a Th1 CD4+ \u03b1\u03b2 response. Activated T cells secrete IFN-\u03b3 profile, which leads to a cascade of cytokines. Effector CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and NK cells target keratinocytes expressing herpesvirus protein. Apoptosis is mediated by granzyme that enters keratinocytes via transient pores induced by perforin. In drug-induced SJS/TEN, it remains unclear how the drug causes sensitization and why only rare individuals are affected. The hapten model proposes that small drug moieties bind to host proteins and are recognized as immunogenic. Keratinocyte death is similarly mediated by CD8+ T cell and NK cells; however, the apoptosis in TEN/SJS is often confluent. Soluble mediators such as TNF-\u03b1, FAS-ligand, and granulysin may play a role. The reader is referred to the reference by Yager (2014) for a detailed review of EM.",

Edema, hemorrhage, and evidence of ischemia and homogenization of dermal collagen are helpful changes. A preponderance of leukocytes in vessels walls rather than in the dermis suggests that vessels are the primary target of inflammation and not just serving to deliver leukocytes. Vessels will stand out in the section because of the attraction of leukocytes to vessel walls. Some generalizations regarding the pathogenesis of the vasculitis can be made from types of leukocytes present within vessel walls; however, the types of leukocytes present do not necessarily point to a particular etiology and may simply reflect the stage of the disease process.",

The localized form is common and develops several months after vaccination. The gross lesion is a focal, typically depressed, alopecic, and hyperpigmented patch (Fig. 6-77A) . The histologic features are characteristic and involve combination of changes in the subcutis, dermis, adnexa, and basement membrane zone/epidermis. Panniculitis is only present at the site of vaccination. The vascular lesions are subtle and not seen in all cases. Venules, arterioles, and small arteries develop a very mild chronic lymphocytic vasculitis, characterized by thickening of the vessel wall, a few intramural mononuclear inflammatory cells, scattered nuclear debris, and variable perivascular mononuclear infiltrates (Fig. 6-77B) . Occasionally, a more florid leukocytoclastic vasculitis is seen. A cell-poor interface dermatitis with vacuolar change in the basal epithelial layer and pigmentary incontinence and mural folliculitis may be present in some cases. The dermis is atrophic and hyalinized, sometimes mucinous. Hair follicles are markedly atrophied and pale staining (\"faded\") ( Fig. 6-77C ). At the site of vaccination, the subcutis contains lymphocytic panniculitis, and some cases may have blue-grey material (vaccine product) extracellularly and within the cytoplasm of macrophages. The additional lesions of erosions and ulcers of the oral mucosa and skin of the extremities and bony prominences and ischemic myopathy in subjacent musculature have been reported in cases with multicentric involvement. Immunofluorescence staining has identified rabies antigen in the vessels and epithelium of the hair follicles. A low-grade immune-mediated vasculitis with resultant tissue anoxia, leading to the atrophic changes in the overlying skin has been suggested as the pathogenesis. Lesions may remain for months to years. Differential diagnoses include dermatomyositis, traction alopecia, idiopathic vasculopathy, and lupus profundus. ",

Alopecia areata may be focal, multifocal, or generalized (alopecia universalis). Lesions occur most commonly on the face, neck, and trunk ( Fig. 6-78A ). Some horses may have hair loss on the mane and tail. Areas of alopecia are usually hyperpigmented and may exhibit sparse short and dystrophic hairs Leukotrichia may be seen in some animals initially. Lesions may be bilaterally symmetrical. There is no apparent age, breed, or sex predilection. Rodent models are available to study the condition-the C3H/HeJ mouse and the Dundee experimental bald rat. Early, clinically active lesions are characterized histologically by an accumulation of lymphocytes (\"swarm of bees\") in and around the inferior segment of anagen hair folliclesthe classic example of peribulbar lymphocytic folliculitis ( Fig.  6-78B) . Unfortunately, the classic lesion is not always evident, and more subtle bulbar inflammation is the rule. Bulbar keratinocytes are frequently vacuolated, apoptotic, or karyorrhectic. Pigmentary incontinence and melanophagia in the peribulbar region are also typical findings. Telogen follicles are unaffected, and dystrophic hair follicles may be present. Demonstration of the lymphocytic peribulbitis may be difficult and require examination of multiple sections from different levels of the paraffin-embedded biopsy specimen. Immunostaining to detect CD3+ lymphocytes may be helpful in some cases. Biopsies from the periphery of early, expanding lesions are most rewarding. Histologic findings in chronic, clinically static lesions are nondiagnostic, revealing a predominance of telogen hair follicles and follicular atrophy that may be misdiagnosed as an endocrine skin disorder. Immunologic studies in dogs and horses have indicated that the intrabulbar lymphocytes are primarily cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes. CD1+ dendritic antigen-presenting cells and both CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes are found in the peribulbar infiltrate. In addition, various autoantibodies targeting trichohyaline, hair keratins, and other components of the hair follicle have been demonstrated in various species, indicating a role for humoral immunity.

Chronically infected, reinfected, or possibly, latently infected carrier animals may allow the virus to persist in a flock for several years. Viral vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important virulence gene in the pathogenesis of orf. Epidermal hyperplasia and capillary growth with increased vascular permeability allows increased virus replication and formation of crusts. Crusts rich in virus particles favor the chances of virus survivability in the environment for extended periods. Via the CD95 pathway, ORFV can induce apoptosis of antigenpresenting cells. By inhibiting Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2), the virus is also able to inhibit apoptosis of virally infected cells.",

Lesions usually start as erythematous macules and papules, and do not form the umbilicated pustules seen in cowpox and vaccinia infections.

Human cowpox infection is rare, and most have been associated with infected cats. Domestic cats develop cutaneous and, occasionally, respiratory lesions. Transmission is probably through rodent bites or feeding on rodents carrying the virus. Most cats have a single primary cutaneous lesion, usually on the head, neck, forelimbs, or paws ( Fig. 6-81A) . A secondary bacterial infection may develop, resulting in an abscess or cellulitis. A viremic period occurs 1-3 weeks following the initial infection, and affected cats may be febrile, inappetent, and depressed. Secondary skin lesions develop during this viremic phase and consist of multiple papules that enlarge to small nodules over 3-5 days and ulcerate, forming craters and crusts. Lesions are rarely vesicular except on the oral mucosa and inner aspect of the pinna. The ulcers heal with thick gray crusts over 2-3 weeks. Mucocutaneous junctions, oral mucosa, and the tongue may also be involved. Most cats recover within 4-5 weeks, and permanent scarring can occur. However, some cats develop more severe and sometimes fatal disease. Rarely, domestic cats can develop a fatal necrotizing pneumonia without typical skin lesions. Exotic felids, especially cheetahs, are at high risk of developing a rapidly fatal necrotizing pneumonia during the viremic period. More severe disease is rare in domestic cats and is often associated with severe secondary bacterial infection or immune suppression caused by concurrent infection with feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, at any age and in any breed. Like pseudocowpox, transmission occurs via contamination of skin abrasions. Lesions occur on the muzzle, nostrils, lips, and mouth, although they can become more widespread (see Vol. 2, Alimentary system and peritoneum), and cows with suckling calves can develop teat and udder lesions.

Cowpox is enzootic in Europe and in some western states of the former Soviet Union, and in adjacent areas of Northern and Central Asia. The natural reservoirs are wild rodents, with the highest seroprevalence in bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus). In cattle, poxvirus lesions most commonly develop on the teats and udder. A thick red crust, 1-2 cm in diameter is characteristic. In severe cases, lesions occur on the medial thighs, Vaccinia. Species Vaccinia virus (VACV), and vaccinialike viruses in genus Orthopoxvirus, infects horses, cattle, swine, and humans. This virus was used for the immunization of humans during the smallpox eradication campaign. The origin of the virus is controversial. One theory is that it represents the laboratory survival of horsepoxvirus, which is now considered extinct in nature, and that horse-derived material was the source of vaccine material used by Edward Jenner in 1817 to protect against variola or smallpox. It may have arisen from buffalopox virus, which is antigenically almost identical to VACV. Another theory is that VACV was derived from cowpox virus by repeated passage on the skin of cows, sheep, and other animals, and that \"horsepox\" was caused by the infection of horses with cowpox virus. Incidental infections in cattle, horses, and pigs were transferred from vaccinated people. The lesions in cattle are indistinguishable from those of cowpox, and in swine are indistinguishable from those of swinepox. When vaccinia is inoculated onto scarified skin of horses, papular lesions resembling a naturally occurring poxvirus infection described in horses in the United States results. Furthermore, inoculation of the skin of the flexor surface of the pastern produces lesions resembling the classic \"grease heel\" form of horsepox. Although most clinical descriptions of VACV are associated with vaccination, over the past decade, a number of outbreaks of VACV affecting dairy cattle and humans in Brazil have been reported. Coinfection by VACV and orf virus-like parapoxvirus has also been reported in dairy cattle in Brazil. An outbreak of orthopoxvirus involving 14 horses in Brazil had gross findings similar to those of the buccal form of horsepox, but molecular analysis showed a high nucleotide sequence homology (95-100%) with Brazilian VACV isolates.

It is characterized by high morbidity and a relatively high mortality rate in young animals. A major effect is a fall in milk production and loss of condition. The disease is characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, and skin lesions. Lesions affect both skin and mucous membranes and follow the usual pattern of pox lesions. Lesions tend to be most concentrated around the face, including eyelids, nostrils, and margins of the pinnae. In severe cases, the whole head may be swollen. Intense pruritus may be seen in acute cases. Later, skin lesions may extend to the neck, limbs, genitalia, mammary glands, and perineum. Generalized skin lesions occur more typically in calves. Skin lesions may take 4-6 weeks to heal. Rarely, the infection can become systemic and involve the mucous membranes of the mouth, respiratory, and digestive tract. Fatalities are usually associated with secondary bacterial infection leading to septicemia, a phenomenon more prevalent in the rainy season. The lesions can be identical to parapox (camel contagious ecthyma), and laboratory tests such as ELISA, PCR, and immunohistochemistry, as well as electron microscopy, can be used to differentiate the infections.

It can also be associated with focal ulcerative lesions, primarily on the haired skin of the face or on the nasal planum, with rare reports of lesions on the feet and trunk. The lesions generally occur in the absence of clinical respiratory signs. In common with other herpesviruses, FeHV-1 can establish latency in the trigeminal ganglion. As affected cats often have a history of previous respiratory disease or recent stress, recrudescence of a latent herpesvirus infection is likely. The macroscopic lesions consist of crusts, ulcers, and vesicles, frequently on the face or nasal planum, which can be persistent or recurrent (Fig.  6-86A) . Microscopically, the lesions are ulcerative and necrotizing, and the mixed dermal inflammation frequently includes numerous eosinophils. There may be foci of degranulating eosinophils around collagen fibers (flame figures). Large amphophilic or glassy intranuclear inclusions are present in the surface and adnexal epithelium (Fig. 6-86B ). They are variable in number and sometimes hard to find in small rafts of epithelial cells surrounded by necrotic debris. The similarity of the inflammatory component in this condition with that of the feline hypersensitivity conditions, such as mosquito- bite hypersensitivity or feline eosinophilic granuloma complex, warrants close scrutiny of eosinophilic necrotizing cutaneous lesions for intranuclear inclusions or examination by molecular techniques.

Histologically, these lesions have been characterized by pyogranulomatous perivascular to nodular dermatitis, pyogranulomatous vasculitis, and folliculitis.

Ulcerative lesions around the head and neck associated with superficial dermal vasculitis have been described in experimentally infected cats. occasional involvement of trunk and extremities is seen rarely in FeLV-infected cats. Histologically, syncytial keratinocytes are seen in the epidermis and superficial follicular epithelium, accompanied by individual cell necrosis (apoptosis), pustules, and ulcers. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrates FeLV antigen in epithelial cells and giant cells. In addition, cutaneous keratin horns seen in FeLV-infected cats have been reported as a primary effect of viral infection of keratinocytes. Recurrent pyoderma and paronychia have been attributed to the immunosuppressive effects of FeLV. Dermatologic diseases associated with naturally occurring chronic FIV infection include generalized demodectic mange, notoedric mange, dermatophytosis, Malassezia dermatitis, cowpoxvirus infections, bowenoid in situ lesions, atypical mycobacteriosis, and abscesses. Cats that are FIV positive are more frequently diagnosed as having subcutaneous abscesses and cellulitis than are noninfected cats. Because the virus is shed in high titer in the saliva, and bite wounds are thought to be an important mode of transmission, this finding may simply reflect a greater tendency for cats that fight to become FIV positive.

Various clinical signs, including diarrhea and sneezing, accompanied the skin lesions. Small slit-like erosions, ruptured vesicles, and extensive ulceration were seen on the tongue, lips, snout, coronary band, and interdigital spaces. Severe lesions sometimes led to separation and sloughing of the hoof wall. Intact vesicles were seen rarely. Sporadic cases have been reported in which the lesions were exudative rather than ulcerative. They were grossly indistinguishable from those of exudative epidermitis. PPV has been cultured from skin and internal organs of affected piglets, and PPV antigen has been detected in hair follicles of lesional skin. Skin lesions were reproduced with tissue culture-origin PPV, but were not as severe as those induced with crude suspensions prepared from the skin lesions. In the sporadic cases, Staphylococcus spp. and swinepox virus were also recovered. It is likely that the severe clinical disease results from dual bacterial and viral infection. Bacterial skin disease is seen much more frequently in dogs than in any other mammalian species, and pyoderma is one of the most common skin diseases in dogs. This apparent increased susceptibility of dogs to pyoderma has been attributed to the relatively thin compact stratum corneum, the small amount of intercellular lipids in the stratum corneum, lack of a protective lipid seal at the entrance of canine hair follicles, and the relatively high pH of canine skin. S. pseudintermedius is the predominant bacterial isolate from canine pyodermas. It is also frequently isolated from canine ear and wound infections and can be a complicating factor in immunomodulatory-responsive lymphocytic-plasmacytic pododermatitis. The pathogenesis of S. pseudintermedius infection is poorly understood. It is an opportunistic pathogen and does not cause disease unless the resistance of the host is lowered or the skin barrier is altered by atopic dermatitis, medical and surgical procedures, and/or immunosuppressive disorders. Similar to Staphylococcus aureus, S. pseudintermedius produces a variety of virulence factors, including enzymes such as coagulase, thermonuclease, and proteases; surface proteins such as clumping factor and protein A; and toxins such as cytotoxins, exfoliative toxin, and enterotoxin. It has also been shown to form biofilms. A major rapidly emerging problem with this organism has been multidrug resistance generally characterized by methicillin resistance and the presence of the mecA gene. The mecA gene encodes an altered, surplus cell wall penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a), which has a low affinity to virtually the entire class of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.",

Primary pyodermas are those for which no underlying cause can be found. However, it is now thought that the vast majority of pyodermas are secondary to underlying cutaneous, endocrine, or immunologic abnormalities. Localized disruption of normal host defenses may be produced by maceration, biting ectoparasites, scratching, abrasions and other skin wounds, or introduction of foreign bodies, such as plant thorns or awns; such disruption promotes development of clinical infection. Allergic, seborrheic, and follicular disorders are the most common predisposing causes of bacterial skin infection in dogs. Hypothyroidism and spontaneous and iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism are common metabolic conditions associated with pyoderma. Primary immunologic abnormalities are uncommon to rare predisposing factors. contagious impetigo in a herd of dairy cattle was associated with crowding and intensive showering of the cows to decrease heat stress during the heat of summer.",

S. hyicus has been cultured from a number of horses with exudative crusty alopecic skin lesions on the distal limbs that resembled \"grease heel\" clinically.

Autogenous vaccines prepared from toxigenic strains of bacteria have been used to prevent infection in some situations. The pathogenesis of exudative epidermitis is incompletely understood. Both virulent and nonvirulent strains of S. hyicus are part of the normal skin flora of healthy pigs; it is carried on the conjunctiva, snout, ear skin, and vagina. The highest rates of carriage of the organism are found in the youngest piglets, suggesting that the organisms are acquired at birth. It is thought that infection develops as a result of trauma that breaches the skin barrier. Other factors that may predispose piglets to developing clinical disease include agalactia of the sow, concurrent infections, and nutritional deficiencies. The presence of porcine circovirus 2 and porcine parvovirus have been suggested as predisposing factors.

Staphylococcal folliculitis and furunculosis are very common in the dog; common in horses, goats, and sheep; and uncommon in cats, cattle, and pigs. Skin lesions associated with folliculitis and furunculosis are extremely variable. The earliest skin lesion is a follicular papule with one or several hairs protruding from the center. The papule develops into a pustule, but these are very fragile, break easily, and are thus very transient. Consequently, crusted papules are seen more commonly than are pustules. In shorthaired dogs, horses, and cattle, the earliest clinical sign is a dishevelment of the haircoat produced by small groups of hairs tufting together above the skin surface, an appearance that can be confused with urticaria. As the hairs fall out of infected follicles, multiple small foci of alopecia and scaling develop. The haircoat develops a moth-eaten appearance as the areas of alopecia become progressively larger. Lesions often enlarge and develop a central ulcer that discharges purulent or serosanguineous exudate that dries to form a crust.

Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is usually the primary pathogen in bacterial folliculitis and furunculosis in dogs. However, gram-negative bacteria, such as Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Escherichia coli are common secondary invaders. Rarely, acute deep pyoderma presenting with dorsal truncal pain has been associated with a pure culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in dogs. In some cases, this condition may be associated with self-service doggrooming facilities or aggressive grooming, such as backclipping and back-combing. Deep pyoderma may be localized or widespread. Localized forms of staphylococcal deep pyoderma commonly involve the bridge of the nose, the chin (\"canine acne\"), paws (interdigital \"pedal\" folliculitisfurunculosis), and pressure points. A particularly refractory form of staphylococcal pyoderma has been recognized in German Shepherd dogs. German Shepherd pyoderma is a genetically inherited characteristic clinical syndrome that can be triggered by a variety of other diseases in susceptible individuals. This condition affects middle-aged German Shepherd dogs and their crosses. Rump, back, ventral abdomen, and thighs are the typical distribution. In some cases, lesions are more generalized. These dogs have a disproportionately severe form of pyoderma. Typical lesions include papules, pustules, erosions, and crusts, followed by ulcers, draining tracts, furunculosis, alopecia, and hyperpigmentation. Lesions are pruritic and may be painful. An immunologic abnormality is suspected because most affected dogs have a relative increase in the CD8+ T lymphocytes and relative decrease in the CD4+ and CD21+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood. Whether these changes are a cause or effect of the disease is unknown, and in addition, some believe that in general normal German Shepherd dogs have lower lymphocyte subpopulations with a relative increase of CD8+ T lymphocytes. Examination of T and B lymphocytes in histologic sections found a marked paucity of T lymphocytes in lesions of deep pyoderma of German Shepherd dogs as compared to similar lesions from dogs of other breeds. Although not always apparent, there is generally thought to be another factor that triggers the condition (e.g., flea-bite hypersensitivity, atopic dermatitis, adverse food reactions, ehrlichiosis, or hypothyroidism).",

            "text": "Microscopically, actinomycosis and nocardiosis are characterized by pyogranulomatous dermatitis and panniculitis. The epidermis is variably acanthotic and may be ulcerated. The dermis and subcutis contain central accumulations of neutrophils surrounded by a wall of epithelioid macrophages and variable numbers of multinucleated giant cells. Necrosis may be prominent within the central abscess. The pyogranulomas are separated by granulation tissue or dense fibrous connective tissue containing lymphocytes and plasma cells. Fibrosis tends to be more common and severe in actinomycosis than in nocardiosis. Organized masses, measuring 30-3,000 \u00b5m or more in diameter, of basophilic-or amphophilic-staining organisms, may be seen in the centers of the abscesses (Fig.  6-92B ). They are commonly bordered by a clubbed corona of brightly eosinophilic Splendore-Hoeppli material. These structures correspond to the sulfur granules seen grossly in the exudate. Although granule formation is a more common feature of actinomycosis, Nocardia spp. may form granules in cutaneous lesions that are morphologically indistinguishable from those of Actinomyces. In nocardiosis, the bacteria tend to be distributed singly and are more difficult to identify in H&E-stained sections. With Gram stain, the bacteria are evident as delicate, branched, and beaded filaments, from 10-30 \u00b5m or more long and 0.5-1.0 \u00b5m wide. The beaded appearance is due to alternating gram-positive and gram-negative regions within the filament and is less prominent with Actinomyces than with Nocardia spp. Most Nocardia spp. are at least partially acid fast when using a modified acid-fast stain such as Fite-Faraco stain in tissue sections (Fig. 6-93) , whereas Actinomyces spp. and other anaerobic actinomycetes are not acid fast. Definitive diagnosis can be made with anaerobic culture for Actinomyces and aerobic culture for Nocardia spp. Diagnosis of specific Nocardia spp. can be made by molecular sequencing of 16S rRNA. Major virulence factors are the complex cell wall lipids and resistance to phagocytosis. Nocardia spp. also have the ability to invade blood vessels, leading to vascular necrosis and ischemia. Cutaneous nocardiosis is reported most frequently in cats, dogs, horses, and cattle, with very rare occurrence in goats. In cattle, Nocardia spp. are more commonly associated with mastitis. There are >30 named Nocardia spp., and different species are correlated with differences in disease features and pathogenicity. The most commonly isolated organisms are Nocardia asteroides complex types I-VI, which include N. nova, N. farcinica, N. brasiliensis, and N. otitidis-caviarum. The gross lesions of actinomycosis and nocardiosis are usually indistinguishable. In cats, nocardia panniculitis is clinically indistinguishable from panniculitis caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria. Lesions consist of abscesses, cellulitis, ulcerated nodules, draining tracts, and dense fibrous masses. When the triad of clinical signs consisting of tumefaction, draining tracts, and tissue grains is present, the lesion can be termed an actinomycotic mycetoma. Lesions progress slowly by local extension. They occur most commonly on the head, neck, and extremities. Pleural and retroperitoneal infections may extend frequent. M. microti (the \"vole bacillus\") causes cutaneous tuberculosis in cats, llamas, and rarely dogs. M. microti infection is believed to be transmitted via direct contact with wild rodents and other small mammals. In cats, most cases of M. microti involve submandibular lymphadenopathy and/or cutaneous lesions that typically affect the \"fight and bite\" sites: face, legs, and tail base. In some cases, the infection can become disseminated with spread to the lungs. Tuberculous mycobacteria possess mycolate-containing molecules in their cell walls, including the original cord factor trehalose 6,6\u2032-dimycolate. These substances are associated with virulence and the production of characteristic tubercles. To be maintained in nature, they require infection of reservoir mammalian hosts because environmental survival is limited to a maximum of a few weeks on infected fomites.",

Rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) (formerly Runyon Group IV or atypical mycobacteria) are by definition characterized by the ability to form colonies on solid media within 7 days of incubation. These bacteria are ubiquitous free-living organisms that are usually harmless and commonly found in water, soil, and decaying vegetation. RGM cause opportunistic disease in both healthy and immunocompromised individuals. These organisms are opportunistic environmental saprophytes. Infections are most common in cats, less frequent in dogs and rare in cattle, horses, and other species. Infection has been reported in Australia, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, France, Finland, the Netherlands, Italy, and Switzerland. Three syndromes are recognized: mycobacterial panniculitis involving chronic infection of the subcutis and skin, pyogranulomatous lobar pneumonia, and disseminated systemic disease in immunocompromised individuals. Panniculitis is the most common clinical presentation, especially in Australian cats. Rapidly growing mycobacteria reported to cause cutaneous granulomas in dogs and cats are the Mycobacterium fortuitum group Lesions can occur anywhere but are most common in the cat in the caudal abdomen, inguinal region, or lumbar region. The causative organisms thrive in fatty tissues. The bacterial cell wall contains glycolipids. It is thought that the lipid may provide nutrients for the organisms to grow and protect them from the immune response. A lipid-rich environment activates virulent mycolic acids in the bacterial cell walls, resulting in granulomatous inflammation. Lesions may or may not be painful, and the regional lymph nodes may not be enlarged. With solitary lesions, systemic illness is rarely observed. In immunocompromised animals, lesions may be widespread, and anorexia, fever, and inappetence may be observed. Lesions generally develop slowly over a period of weeks to months after a history of a penetrating wound or cat fight. Lesions include single or multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous nodules, plaques, purpuric macules, or diffuse swellings.

The mycobacterial organisms gain entry via skin wounds, particularly those caused by tick bites. Skin lesions are most common on the head, neck, shoulder, and legs.

Clinically and histologically, the condition resembles actinomycotic and eumycotic mycetomas. The disease occurs in humans and all domestic animals, including alpacas. Although reported rarely, the condition is probably not uncommon. Lesions are usually localized in the skin and subcutis but may extend deep to involve underlying bone and muscle. Disseminated infection with visceral involvement is rare. Coagulase-positive staphylococci are involved most commonly, but Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Actinobacillus, Pasteurella, Proteus, Escherichia, Trueperella, and Bibersteinia have also been isolated from lesions. Infection is thought to develop as a result of wound contamination or trauma, such as bites, lacerations, or puncture wounds with foreign bodies. Lesions typically consist of firm, nonpruritic single or multiple nodules that ulcerate and develop draining tracts. They discharge purulent material that frequently contains white to yellow sand-like grains. The most common lesion sites in horses are limbs, lips, chin, and scrotum. The microscopic lesion is characterized by the presence of basophilic granules within the center of neutrophilic abscesses or pyogranulomas in the dermis or subcutis. These granules correspond to the grains seen grossly in the discharge. They are surrounded and separated by fibrous tissue that may be quite extensive. Plant debris or other foreign material may also be seen in the lesions and indicate the means of infection. The granules consist of compact bacterial colonies that are usually surrounded by amorphous, deeply eosinophilic, radially arranged Splendore-Hoeppli material (Fig. 6-96A ). This material is thought to be antigen-antibody complexes. The bacteria are not well delineated in H&E-stained sections; thus special stains are usually necessary to distinguish the organisms from actinomycotic bacteria and fungi. Individual cocci or bacilli within the granules are seen most clearly in sections stained with tissue Gram or Brown-Brenn stains (Fig. 6-96B ). The granulomatous reaction is thought to develop as a result of a delicate balance between the virulence of the organism and the response of the host. The host is able to isolate the infection but is unable to eradicate it. It is speculated that this may be associated with a polysaccharide slime coating produced by the bacteria. Lloyd D.

Contact with contaminated substrate for <1 hour has been shown to be adequate for transmission, and outbreaks have been associated with contact with environment contaminated by affected animals as long as 4 days previously. D. nodosus produces a variety of extracellular proteases (the major one is AprV5) that are thought to digest the horn and allow bacterial invasion of the epidermal matrix of the horn. It also produces a heat-stable soluble factor (AprV2) that enhances the growth and invasiveness of F. necrophorum. Type IV fimbriae promote close contact between D. nodosus and host cells and allow the bacteria to translocate to a more anaerobic environment that is necessary for bacterial growth and protease production. F. necrophorum produces a leukocidal exotoxin that reduces phagocytosis. The separation of horn is caused by lysis of the epidermal matrix as a result of the local inflammatory response rather than from direct bacterial attack. T. pyogenes and other aerobic bacteria are usually located superficially in the lesion, where they remove oxygen, destroy hydrogen peroxide, and create the anaerobic environment necessary for the growth of the 2 anaerobic pathogens. The severity of ovine footrot can vary from benign to a virulent form. Benign footrot, also called foot-scald, is a milder, less persistent form of the condition. It is typically characterized by moderate interdigital dermatitis that causes mild lameness and minimal production loss. The benign form has a greater propensity for self-cure. Virulence of D. nodosus varies widely from strain to strain. Virulent strains of the bacterium produce more extracellular proteases, including elastase, and proteases from virulent strains tend to be more thermostable than those from benign strains. The virulent form of footrot in sheep is the serious, persistent form of the disease characterized by severe necrotic damage to the hoof and extensive separation of hoof horn in more than one foot in a high percentage of the sheep. The infection may persist for more than 1 year if not treated, and chronically infected sheep may die of emaciation as a result of severe pain and lameness. Affected animals are also predisposed to fly strike.",

The disease is initiated by maceration of the interdigital skin brought about by wet conditions along with minor wounds and abrasions. The damaged epidermis then becomes colonized by F. necrophorum, aerobic diphtheroids, coliforms, and other common bacteria originating from the soil, skin, and feces. Footrot develops if the dermatitis is subsequently complicated by infection with D. nodosus. The bacterium is an obligate parasite of the ruminant hoof, and carrier animals serve as the source for uninfected stock. Transmission of infection requires adequate moisture and a mean ambient temperature >10\u00b0 C. Direct contact between susceptible and infected sheep is not required for transmission multifactorial disease. The condition has been compared to chronic periodontitis in humans because both are tissuedestructive diseases with multibacterial etiology in which spirochetes appear to be predominant. The condition is also usually associated with management conditions in which the feet of cattle remain wet for prolonged periods. Some research has indicated that there is upregulation of interleukin-8 (IL-8) by keratinocytes. This may explain the epidermal hyperplasia in these lesions because IL-8 is known to have a stimulatory effect on the migration and proliferation of keratinocytes. IL-8 also plays a key role in the recruitment of neutrophils, which are common in the epidermis of these lesions.",

Factors that alter the superficial keratin barrier (such as maceration, chronic trauma, or burns), upset normal flora (such as prolonged broad spectrum antibiotic therapy), or produce immunosuppression (such as diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism, neoplasia, viral infections, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or prolonged glucocorticoid treatment) predispose to infection with the organism.

            "text": "Histopathology is an important diagnostic tool for fungal infections. It is a relatively rapid and inexpensive means to make a definitive or presumptive diagnosis of mycotic infection. In many cases, fungal infections are mistaken for neoplasms, and the entire lesion is fixed and submitted for histologic examination. Consequently, only fixed tissue is available, and the pathologist has the responsibility for the final diagnosis because the organism cannot be cultured. Some fungal organisms have distinctive enough morphologic features that, if present in sufficient numbers, they can be identified with a high degree of certainty, for instance, Blastomyces, Cryptococcus, and Coccidioides. Other mycotic infections are caused by a variety of fungi that are similar in appearance in tissues and cannot be specifically identified, although the disease can be named, for instance, dermatophytosis, phaeohyphomycosis, and eumycotic mycetoma. In some cases, fungi may be detectable in tissues but may be impossible to identify, and only the conclusion that mycotic infection exists can be made. Although immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical methods for identification of fungi in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections have been developed, the specific antisera are not readily available, and culture remains the mainstay for identification of fungal pathogens. Some fungi stain with H&E, but many fungi do not stain or stain very poorly with H&E. However, even in these cases, fungal infection can be suspected because of the presence of clear circular or linear structures, representing unstained fungal hyphae, within the lesion. Special fungal stains, such as Gomori methenamine silver (GMS), which stains fungi black, PAS, which stains fungi pink-red, delineate the fungi so that their morphology can be examined. In general, GMS is better for screening tissue because some fungal-like organisms (e.g., Pythium) stain poorly with PAS. Fungal stains may mask the natural color of fungi, however. To determine whether a fungus is pigmented, it can be examined in unstained cleared and mounted sections, or a melanin stain, such as Fontana-Masson, can be applied to the tissue.",

Pathologic commonly associated with skin disease in dogs and cats. It is also the species most commonly isolated from the skin, mucosa, and ear canals of healthy dogs and cats. When associated with skin disease, it is currently believed that Malassezia infection is due to overgrowth of normal flora resulting from disturbances of the normal physical, chemical, or immunologic mechanisms controlling the skin surface microenvironment and host defenses. Virulence factors associated with M. pachydermatis include the production of various hydrolases, including lipases, phospholipases, aspartyl proteases, and acid sphingomyelinases. Isolates of M. pachydermatis have also been shown to form biofilms on surfaces of various materials. Malassezia dermatitis is most common in dogs. Greater than 70% of dogs have concurrent dermatoses, including allergies, keratinization defects, endocrinopathies, and bacterial pyoderma. Predisposed breeds include West Highland White Terrier, Bassett Hound, American Cocker Spaniel, Shih Tzu, English Setter, Toy and Miniature Poodle, Boxer, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Australian and Silky Terriers, German Shepherd dog, and Dachshund. Excessive surface lipid or cerumen, high humidity, or failure of host defense mechanisms to control overgrowth of the yeast may predispose an animal to develop clinical disease. Dogs with Malassezia dermatitis develop high serum titers of specific IgG antibody and exhibit significantly greater skin test reactions in response to intradermal injection of M. pachydermatis extracts than dogs without evidence of Malassezia dermatitis, suggesting that hypersensitivity may be involved in the pathogenesis of clinical disease. Lesions associated with Malassezia dermatitis include erythema, alopecia, greasiness, yellow-gray scaly plaques, lichenification, and hyperpigmentation ( Fig. 6-99A) . A rancid offensive odor is typical, and moderate to severe pruritus is a common feature. Lesions may be localized or generalized, and the most common sites include lips, ear canals, axillae, groin, ventral neck, inguinal area, interdigital skin, perianal area, and intertriginous regions. Malassezia paronychia and/or claw infections produce red-brown discoloration of paronychial hairs or claws (Fig. 6-99B ).

Environmental factors include hot, humid weather, with wet, poorly ventilated unsanitary conditions, and decreased exposure to sunlight. Transmission of dermatophytes occurs by direct contact with infected animals or indirectly by exposure to infective hair and scales in the environment (contaminated grooming equipment, bedding, saddles, cages, etc.). Hair fragments containing infectious arthrospores are the most effective means of transmission.

The process by which the stratum corneum (SC) is continually renewed may also present a form of defense against organisms because the process results in continuous shedding of the SC and thus removes infecting organisms with the sloughed keratin. Disruption of the SC, either by microabrasions or maceration, appears to be important in facilitating invasion by the fungus. Fungal cells adhere to keratinocytes and migrate to the follicular orifice. Dermatophytes produce keratinolytic enzymes, endoproteases, and exoproteases, which hydrolyze keratin and enable them to penetrate and invade the hair shaft. They grow downward within the hair shaft toward the hair bulb until they reach the keratogenous zone (Adamson's fringe), where they stop because they cannot grow in viable tissue. Infection continues as long as the downward growth of the fungus is in equilibrium with keratin production; if not, the fungus is sloughed and the hair is cleared of infection. When the hair enters telogen phase, keratin production stops and fungal growth ceases. Hair shafts are weakened as a result of penetration by the fungi, and they become brittle and easily broken.",

Histopathology is not considered as sensitive as culture for diagnosis, but it can be used to confirm infection when the significance of a cultured organism is in question. It is most useful in the nodular forms, such as kerion and pseudomycetoma, which are frequently negative when superficial material is cultured. Biopsies should be taken within the outer border of expanding alopecia as this is the most active site of infection, and organisms are most likely to be present. In most cases, fungal organisms are evident in H&E-stained sections, but in some instances, fungal stains (PAS, GMS) are necessary to demonstrate infection. Dermatophytes occur as septate hyphae that break up into chains of round to oval arthrospores in the surface and follicular keratin. Hyphae are also usually present in the hair shafts, and arthrospores are formed on the outside of the hairs (ectothrix) or within the hairs (endothrix). In some cases, fungal organisms are present only in the surface keratin (T. mentagrophytes and M. persicolor in dogs); if this material was removed in preparing the skin for obtaining the biopsy or is lost during tissue processing, the diagnosis will be missed. Orthokeratotic and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis is a typical feature of dermatophytosis, and acanthosis is variable, ranging from mild to marked (Fig.  6-101A ). Inflammation may be very mild and consist of low numbers of perivascular and perifollicular lymphocytes and macrophages (Fig. 6-101B) . This is the case when infection is caused by a species of dermatophyte that is well adapted to its host. Neutrophilic luminal folliculitis is a common lesion in dermatophytosis and may result in follicular rupture and development of discrete granulomas surrounding fragments of hair at the base of the follicles (Fig. 6-101C) . Eosinophils may be numerous in these trichogranulomas. Kerions consist of diffuse pyogranulomatous inflammation in the deep dermis produced by extensive furunculosis (see Fig. 6-100B ). This form of B A inflammation is most commonly caused by poorly adapted organisms, such as the geophilic dermatophyte M. gypseum. Hair fragments containing hyphae and arthrospores are frequently present among the inflammatory cells but may be destroyed by the intense inflammatory reaction. In some cases, the pattern of inflammation may be confused with autoimmune diseases.

            "text": "Sporotrichosis is an uncommon chronic infection usually limited to skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by the opportunist fungal pathogen Sporothrix schenckii. The organism is a dimorphic fungus, growing as hyphae at environmental temperatures and in yeast form in tissue. S. schenckii exists as a saprophyte distributed worldwide in the soil, on plants, and on various plant materials. It is more common in tropical, subtropical, and temperate zones and is endemic in Central and South America and Africa. Since 1998, there has been an ongoing epidemic affecting cats, dogs, and humans in Rio de Janeiro and Southern Brazil. Sporotrichosis has been reported in cats, dogs, horses, mules, donkeys, cattle, goats, swine, camels, humans, and a variety of other animal species. The infection has been reported most often in cats, horses, and dogs. Infection is usually acquired by wound contamination or inoculation of the organism into tissue by puncture wounds caused by thorns, wood splinters, or contaminated claws. Pulmonary infection is occasionally acquired by inhalation of spores. In humans, the disease is considered an occupational hazard for those who work with the soil, plants, or plant materials. Sporotrichosis is considered a zoonotic disease. Transmission of the infection from cats to humans has been reported many times, and infected cats pose a significant public health danger. Veterinarians, other veterinary professionals and students, and owners exposed to ulcerated wounds or exudates from infected cats have developed infections. The organism may be be extensive. Fungi are distributed throughout the lesion as scattered small aggregates and individual hyphae. The hyphae are septate, 2-6 \u00b5m wide, and branched or unbranched. They are often constricted at their prominent thick septations and may contain single or chains of thick-walled vesicular swellings, 25 \u00b5m or more in diameter, that resemble chlamydospores (Fig.  6-105B) . The innate brown pigment may not be readily apparent in tissue sections, especially in cases of Alternaria spp. Melanin stains, such as Fontana-Masson, can be used to confirm the presence of melanin in the hyphae. Fungal stains demonstrate the organisms well but can mask the natural color. The etiologic agents are so similar in appearance within tissues that they cannot be identified on the basis of their morphology. Culture is always needed for specific identification of the fungi. Phaeohyphomycosis has been confused with eumycotic mycetomas caused by dematiaceous fungi. The fungi in mycetomas form discrete organized granules, whereas those of phaeohyphomycosis appear as individual hyphae and small aggregates scattered throughout the lesion. The aggregates of hyphae in phaeohyphomycosis may be surrounded by Splendore-Hoeppli material, but this does not constitute a granule. The fungal elements of phaeohyphomycosis are frequently intracellular within epithelioid macrophages and multinucleated histiocytic giant cells; granules of mycetomas are nearly always extracellular. A B multinucleated histiocytic giant cells, and fewer lymphocytes and plasma cells form discrete granulomas or extensive sheets of inflammation replacing dermal and subcutaneous tissues. Fibrosis is variable; and necrosis may be extensive. Yeast(s) surrounded by a stellate radial corona of brightly eosinophilic material (asteroid body/Splendore-Hoeppli reaction) are seen in some cases. The yeasts appear as round, oval, or elongated (\"cigar\"-shaped) single or budding cells that measure 2-6 \u00b5m or more in diameter for the round and oval forms and 2 \u00d7 3 to 3 \u00b5 10 \u00b5m for the cigar form ( Fig. 6-106B) . The cigar forms are considered characteristic of Sporothrix, but they may not be regularly found. In general, organisms are numerous in lesions from cats and rare in tissues from dogs and horses. However, some reports indicate that visible organisms may be few or absent in some cats. In immunosuppressed dogs, yeasts may be numerous. The yeasts may be extracellular or within neutrophils and macrophages. The yeasts have a refractile cell wall from which the cytoplasm may shrink during processing and give the appearance of a capsule. In such instances and when no cigar forms are evident, the organism may be mistaken for Cryptococcus neoformans or Histoplasma capsulatum. Yeasts stand out clearly with fungal stains, but serial sections may be needed to demonstrate even a single organism. Without a significant number of cigar-shaped forms, identification may not be possible. Tissue culture, immunohistochemistry, or fluorescent antibody staining may be necessary for definitive able to penetrate intact skin because not all patients who develop lesions can recall having wounds or being bitten or scratched by infected cats. The large number of organisms typically present in lesions from cats is thought to be the reason for the transmission of disease from cats to humans. However, even when the lesions in cats had few organisms, transmission to humans has occurred. In contrast, infection was not transmitted from a dog with multiple cutaneous lesions containing relatively numerous organisms to several adults and children with whom the dog had had frequent contact for the 2-year duration of infection. These cases suggest that factors in addition to absolute numbers of yeasts are involved in the apparent ease of cat-to-human transmission.",

It is thought that this form results from a high degree of host immunity, preventing spread of infection. Nodules may become ulcerated and associated with seropurulent exudate and crust formation. The normal grooming behavior of cats may result in autoinoculation and spread of lesions to distant sites. The cutaneous form may have a very chronic course. An unusual case of sporotrichosis in a dog consisted of otitis externa characterized by multiple cutaneous nodules that persisted for >5 years. A donkey with sporotrichosis had multiple slowly progressive facial lesions for 2 years before the disease was diagnosed. \u2022 The cutaneous-lymphatic form involves the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and associated lymphatics. Lesions begin as firm round nodules at the site of entry, usually on an extremity, and spread proximally along lymphatics. Lymphatic vessels become thick and corded, and a series of secondary nodules forms as the infection progresses. The nodules may break open and discharge seropurulent material. Lesions may cavitate and expose extensive areas of underlying muscle and bone. Regional lymphadenopathy is common. This is the most common form in horses and humans. Lesions generally involve the proximal forelimbs, chest, and thigh, but usually no regional lymph node involvement is evident. Dogs usually have the cutaneous or cutaneous-lymphatic form. The head, pinnae, and trunk are involved most frequently. In cats, lesions are usually located on the head, distal limbs, and base of the tail (Fig. 6-106A) .",

It develops as a sequela to cutaneous-lymphatic infection or following inhalation of the fungus. The disseminated form of sporotrichosis occurs most frequently in cats, and no immunosuppressive factors are usually identified. In experimentally induced sporotrichosis in cats, organisms were shown by culture to have disseminated to viscera in 50% of the cases. Cats with disseminated sporotrichosis are often febrile, depressed, and anorexic. This is a rare presentation in dogs. Microscopically, sporotrichosis is usually a nodular-to-diffuse pyogranulomatous or granulomatous inflammatory reaction involving the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The epidermis is acanthotic or ulcerated. Neutrophils, epithelioid macrophages, A B the organism develops biflagellate zoospores in wet environments. The infective stage of the organism is a biflagellate aquatic zoospore that is released seasonally in association with warm weather and moisture. Most infections occur in late summer and fall. Infection is thought to be acquired from prolonged contact with stagnant fresh water containing the newly emerged zoospores that are motile and are attracted chemotactically to animal hair, damaged skin, and intestinal mucosa. Once the zoospores are in contact, they encyst on the surface of injured tissue. The encysted zoospores secrete a sticky amorphous glycoprotein that mediates the adhesion of zoospores to tissue. The body temperature of the host stimulates the encysted zoospores to develop a germ tube (hypha) that extends into the infected tissue and can later infiltrate blood vessels. These organisms also produce proteases that weaken host tissue, enhancing the ability of the hyphae to invade tissue. The zoospore stage is not known to form in tissue, and the infection is thus not considered to have zoonotic potential. Not all animals with pythiosis have a history of contact with permanent bodies of water, suggesting that the organism may proliferate in temporary stands of water or even on wet grasses.",

Lesions occur most commonly on the limbs, distal to the carpus and hock, and on the ventral aspect of the thorax and abdomen, sites that are most likely to be in contact with stagnant water and would be traumatized by aquatic plants or vegetation. Affected horses frequently have a history of prolonged contact with water in lakes, ponds, swamps, or flooded areas. Lesions are usually single, but occasional horses develop lesions in several separate sites. Lesions begin as nodules that enlarge very rapidly to become circular masses of granulation tissue. The masses ulcerate or develop multiple draining tracts that discharge thick purulohemorrhagic material. The tracts also contain characteristic gray-white to pale yellow coral-like concretions (called leeches or kunkers) that may be extruded at the skin surface ( Fig. 6-107A ). The colloquial name leeches is based on the initial misidentification of the masses. These structures are unique to the horse and are not seen in other animals with pythiosis. Lesions are frequently extremely pruritic, and biting or rubbing the lesion contributes to tissue damage. The largest lesions usually develop on the thorax and abdomen and may attain a size of 45 cm or more in diameter. In chronic cases, underlying bone may be invaded. Regional lymph nodes may be involved, but visceral spread is rare.

Regional lymphadenopathy consisting of granulomatous to pyogranulomatous lymphadenitis is common and may precede skin lesions. The disease can be very aggressive, and affected dogs frequently develop lesions of the great vessels, mediastinum, lungs, and esophagus. Sudden death caused by great vessel rupture has been reported. Gastrointestinal lesions have not been observed. In some dogs, lesions may be slowly progressive, chronic, and limited to cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues. Microscopically, there is severe eosinophilic and granulomatous inflammation with numerous multinucleated histiocytic giant cells centered around broad 7-25 \u00b5m infrequently septate hyphae. Pyogranulomatous vasculitis may occur. Again, clinical presentation, PCR assays, immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analyses are needed to differentiate these infections.",

Necrotic foci consist of eosinophilic coagulated material corresponding to the kunkers seen grossly. Eosinophils, neutrophils, epithelioid macrophages, and multinucleated histiocytic giant cells surround the eosinophilic coagula and are separated by fibrovascular connective tissue. Fungi are usually located in necrotic foci and may be seen as clear linear or circular hyphal \"ghosts\" often surrounded by a thick (2.5-25 \u00b5m) eosinophilic sleeve (Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon). This finding helps differentiate zygomycosis from pythiosis and lagenidiosis, in which eosinophilic sleeves tend to be thin or absent. In addition, the hyphal diameter (as measured in tissue) tends to be significantly larger for Basidiobolus spp. (5-20 \u00b5m). Conidiobolus spp. are 5-13 \u00b5m wide, and P. insidiosum are 2-7 \u00b5m wide. Basophilic granular protoplasm may be visible with H&E stain, but the organisms are usually better visualized with GMS stain. They frequently stain poorly with PAS. Hyphae are thin walled and have occasional septations and uncommon branching. Folded, twisted, or compressed hyphae may be seen. The lesions of nasal zygomycosis caused by C. incongruus in sheep are characterized by segmental necrosis and thrombosis of subcutaneous blood vessels. Many fungal hyphae are visible in necrotic foci, in thrombi, and within vessel walls. This propensity to invade blood vessels is common with Mucorales but is an unusual feature for the Entomophthorales. the intermediate hosts is not known, but mechanical transmission by blood-sucking insects is regarded as an important natural mode of transmission. Some studies suggest that direct transmission from intermediate host to intermediate host is possible, such as through mating. Tachyzoites in the intermediate host proliferate in endothelial cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. In the later phases of infection, tissue cysts occur. Infection, however, may be generalized and is typically so in some infections in rodents and wild animals. The tissue cysts represent parasitized host cells, for instance, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, or smooth muscle cells. The bradyzoites multiply in cellular vacuoles and induce hyperplastic and hypertrophic changes in the host cells. These often divide to form multinucleated cells. The enlarging mass of crescentshaped bradyzoites compresses the cell cytoplasm and nuclei into a thin rim forming an inner coat to the cyst. A hyalinized collagenous cyst wall is laid down around the parasitized cell. The cysts, which measure up to 500 \u00b5m with a 10-to 50-\u00b5m thick wall, are visible to the naked eye.

Bovine besnoitiosis caused by B. besnoiti is enzootic in Africa and Asia, and both enzootic and epizootic in parts of Europe. It has been reported in France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Germany. The disease also occurs in Israel, Russia, South Korea, and Venezuela. The disease is of high economic importance in Africa, causing mortality in up to 10% and morbidity in >80%. In Europe, mortality is <1%, and although many animals in an endemic area may be seropositive, most are subclinically infected. Predilections for age, breed, and sex appear to vary between geographic regions. In the enzootic regions of France, bovine besnoitiosis occurs preferentially from spring to autumn. Two- to 4-yearold males are more susceptible than females and have more acute signs with higher mortality rates. In the French Alps, where the disease is epizootic, females are more susceptible. Infection appear to be rare in calves <6 months of age. In clinically affected animals, there is an acute and a chronic stage. The acute stage can be confused with bluetongue or malignant catarrhal fever and is characterized by fever, generalized edema, weakness, anorexia, and lymphadenopathy. During this stage, tachyzoites proliferate in macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, resulting in vasculitis and thrombosis, especially in small vessels of the dermis, subcutis, fascia, testes, and upper respiratory mucosa. Pregnant cows may abort, and bulls may develop orchitis and sterility. Besnoitiosis is usually recognized as a chronic disease characterized by alopecia; marked thickening and folding of the skin, especially around the neck, shoulders, and rump; scaling; exudation; and fissuring. Animals lose condition, have decreased milk production, have permanent sterility in some bulls, have significant hide damage, and up to 10% mortality may occur during the chronic stage. Lesions may be painful. During the chronic stage of besnoitiosis, only tissue cysts are found. Tissue cysts are most concentrated around mucous membranes (nares, conjunctiva, vulva, perineum) and sclera (\"scleral pearls\") but also occur commonly in the dermis; subcutis; fascia; muscle; epididymis; testes; in the mucosa of the pharynx, larynx, and trachea; and less commonly in the spleen, liver, lung, lymph nodes, periosteum, endosteum, and heart muscle.

The disease is also reported in mules and a zebra in Africa. Clinical disease is characterized by tens to hundreds of nonpruritic, white, pinpoint papular lesions in the skin and mucous membranes, especially over the nares, conjunctiva, sclera, pinnae, limbs, and perineum ( Fig. 6-108A) .

Outermost is a condensed, hyalinized, laminated, eosinophilic to amphophilic birefringent layer of collagen fibers. Next is a very thin homogeneous intermediate zone. The third layer is the cytoplasm of the host cell, and in this layer lie several giant, vesicular but compressed host cell nuclei.

The disease is most commonly reported in humans and dogs but occurs in a wide variety of domestic mammals and wildlife. Three forms of clinical leishmaniasis are recognized: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral. Cutaneous leishmaniasis occurs worldwide in dogs, cats, horses, and cattle. It is endemic in Mediterranean countries, Portugal, and in parts of Africa, India, and Central and South America. Endemic foci have also been reported in the United States and include regions of Texas, Oklahoma, Ohio, Michigan, and Alabama. Leishmaniasis is also endemic in Foxhound populations in the United States. The most common mode of transmission is through the bite of a female blood-sucking sandfly of the genera Phlebotomus and Lutzomyia. The biting sandfly injects promastigotes and saliva into the skin of the host. The sandfly saliva has potent vasodilating, anticoagulant, anesthetic, and immunomodulatory properties. Other modes of transmission have been suggested, such as blood transfusions and vertical transmission. Domestic and wild dogs, cats, rodents, and other wild mammals act as reservoirs.

The alopecic form of the cutaneous disease in the dog has been shown to be associated with fewer organisms and a more appropriate cellular immune response in terms of number of antigen-presenting Langerhans cells, major histocompatibility complex II-positive keratinocytes, and infiltrating T cells. In contrast, dogs with the",

Infestations with such larvae cause myiasis, which is discussed later. Miller WH, et extent, swine industries. Fly worry refers to the behavioral disturbances in animals brought about by the attempted feeding of flies. Biting flies inflict pain, whereas nonbiting flies cause annoyance by clustering around the eyes and nostrils, where they feed on lacrimal or nasal secretions (Musca autumnalis and Hydrotaea irritans) or by other means, such as simulating the sound of a bumble bee (Hypoderma spp.). Fly-worry occasionally induces such apprehension that the animals run aimlessly (\"gadding\"), and severe injury or death may result from misadventure. Deaths are usually sporadic, but high levels of mortality have been reported. Of much greater economic importance is the loss of production associated with fly-worry. When the insects are numerous, they cause considerable annoyance to livestock, interfere with feeding and resting, and cause reduced milk production and reduced weight gain. Fly-worry has been attributed to biting flies such as the horn fly (Haematobia [Lyperosia] irritans), the stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans), and horse flies (several genera in the family Tabanidae), and to nonbiting species such as house flies (Musca spp.), Hypoderma spp., and the sheep-head fly (Hydrotaea irritans). Culicoides spp. biting midges can cause pruritus and restlessness in horses. Horses that develop a hypersensitivity response to Culicoides spp. bites may suffer weight loss as a result of severe pruritus and irritation (see Immune-mediated dermatoses). Louse flies (Hippobosca spp.) parasitize large animals in many parts of the world. They suck blood and tend to cluster in the perineal and inguinal region. Once the fly lands on its host, it sheds its wings and burrows into the skin to feed. They remain on their host for long periods and are a source of irritation and fly-worry. Mortality may arise from direct toxic effect as well as from misadventure. Death may be the result of urticarial swelling of the head and neck or shock. Many flies are attracted to exhaled carbon dioxide and can occasionally cause death by suffocation of cattle, horses, or other animals when large numbers of flies are inhaled. Mosquitoes, especially aggressive species, such as Aedes vigilex, may cause significant mortality among piglets and puppies. The Simuliidae (black flies or buffalo gnats) are responsible for massive animal mortalities, particularly in temperate latitudes and river valleys following extensive flooding, when the insect population expands. They feed on cattle, horses, sheep, goats, poultry, wild mammals, and birds. Simuliid flies exert systemic effects through inoculation of a heat-stable toxin, which causes increased vascular permeability and abnormalities in cardiorespiratory function, which may cause death.",

It is also known as the human bot fly. The adult fly captures another carrier insect to which it attaches its eggs. The eggs hatch when the carrier insect visits a host. The larvae then attach to the host and penetrate the skin to form local subcutaneous nodules that can be pruritic. The mature larvae exit the nodule through holes that leave the host susceptible to fly strike. A case report of an infected dog from the Netherlands described lesions as painful, erythematous, exudative nodules with a central pore.",

The larvae are referred to as maggots or grubs and may be facultative or obligate parasites. The important families are Cuterebridae, Sarcophagidae (Wohlfahrtia spp.), Gasterophilidae (stomach bots of horses), Oestridae (nasal bots, warbles), and Calliphoridae (blowflies). Calliphorids feed only on dead tissue. Only those flies whose larvae cause cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions are discussed here. Nasal and stomach bots are described elsewhere. Agents of facultative myiasis affecting the skin live in decaying organic matter, and the females oviposit in wounded, infected, or heavily soiled skin of warm-blooded vertebrate hosts. The larvae feed on host tissues and eventually drop to the ground to pupate. Cochliomyia hominivorax, the screwworm fly, has a widespread geographic distribution, feed only on living tissue and has been eliminated from North America. They produce larvae that are obligatory parasites and are discussed separately. Cuterebra. The larvae of Cuterebra spp. (order Diptera; family Oestridae; subfamily Cuterebrinae) are obligate parasites of rodents and rabbits, but occasionally aberrant infestations occur in cats and rarely in dogs, pigs, and humans. Larvae attach to the host's fur and either enter via ingestion through grooming, direct skin penetration, or through natural orifices to migrate to the subcutaneous tissues to produce an initially firm, then fluctuant, cyst-like subcutaneous abscess in which the larvae mature. The larvae breathe through a draining tract in the skin through which they are visible, and feed off tissue debris. Wounds heal slowly after larvae are removed or released, and secondary bacterial infection may occur. The majority of infections occur in late summer or fall. In cats, the larvae have a predilection for the neck area ( Fig. 6-112) , often over the submandibular salivary gland, but swellings also occur in the scrotal region. Larvae may locate in aberrant locations, such as the pharynx, nasal cavity, eye, and brain. The odor induced by the bacterial proliferation and resultant inflammatory exudate attracts the primary flies, which deposit batches of 50-200 ova. The larvae of primary flies emerge within 12-24 hours and grow rapidly, feeding on inflammatory exudates. The primary larvae secrete proteolytic enzymes, including collagenases, which liquefy the host tissues and provide predigested nutrients. The cutaneous necrosis that results attracts the secondary flies to oviposit. The resulting larvae tunnel into the adjacent viable tissue and markedly expand the lesion. The putrefactive odor attracts more flies, and the process is further exacerbated. The lesions of fly strike are often extensive and leave large areas of undermined skin with punched-out holes. The subcutaneous tissues may become cavitated. Muscle may be destroyed and body cavities invaded. Lesions may result in death from shock, debilitation, toxemia, or bacterial septicemia.",

Two orders of lice are recognized. The Mallophaga are chewing lice that have mouth parts specially adapted for feeding on the epithelial scales, feathers, and sebaceous secretions of birds and mammals. The Anoplura have piercing mouth parts and are the sucking lice of mammals. Lice spend their complete life cycle on the host and cannot live away from their hosts for more than a few days. Nits (1-2 mm-long operculated eggs) are attached to hairs by a clear adhesive secretion by female lice (3-6 mm). Spread of infection occurs most commonly via direct contact, but transmission via indirect contact also occurs. Because various species of lice have adapted to different microenvironments within the host pelage, it is possible for an animal to carry several species at once. Infestation with lice is called pediculosis. It tends to be a seasonal problem, being worse in winter. Lice do not breed at temperatures above 30\u00b0 C and die at temperatures around 50\u00b0 C. The signs associated with pediculosis are extremely variable. In most instances, lice do not pose a significant threat to the host. Heavy infestations signal an underlying contributing condition, such as poor sanitation, overcrowding, ill thrift, or poor nutrition. In some cases, animals are asymptomatic carriers or only have scaling with variable pruritus. Most lesions result from skin irritation and pruritus, which ranges from mild to severe. Lesions include scaling, crusting, erythema, papules, excoriations, hair loss, and damage to wool or hide caused by rubbing or biting.

In general, C. felis felis prefers the rump and inguinal areas. E. gallinacea has a preference for the face. S. cuniculi, the rabbit flea, has a preference for the pinnae and periauricular region. Typically, hunting cats, primarily in parts of Europe and Australia, acquire the infestation from their prey. Macroscopic lesions are crusted, alopecic papules on both aspects of the pinnae and periauricular areas. Histologically, there are perivascular to interstitial eosinophils. Tunga penetrans, most common in South America and Africa, burrows into the skin and produces significant damage at the site of attachment. Some animals, despite heavy infestations, remain asymptomatic carriers. Some animals may develop flea-bite dermatitis, which is a reaction to the many irritant substances in the flea's saliva, but the vast majority of lice are commonly found on the poll, pinnae, muzzle, periocular region, neck, brisket, withers, tail, axillae, and groin. Heavy periorbital infestation of heifers by H. quadripertusus has caused keratoconjunctivitis and periorbital papillomatosis. Bovine pediculosis usually has little deleterious effect on weight gain and other production parameters. Economic consequences are due to deterioration of hide quality, damage to fences, and costs of treatment. One exception is H. eurysternus infestation, which may cause anemia and death in some uniquely susceptible cattle. L. vituli has been associated with severe anemia and mortality in young buffaloes. Sucking lice can serve as vectors of severe diseases, including anaplasmosis, theileriosis, and dermatomycosis.",

The condition is usually pruritic, and lesions are most commonly present on the head, neck, and pinnae but can become more widespread, involving the shoulders, back, rump, sides, and perineum. In some cases, clinical signs are limited to the ears and include head shaking, ear twitching, scaling in the ear canals, and occasionally purulent exudate caused by secondary bacterial infections. Skin lesions include papules, crusts, exudation, and alopecia. Psoroptic mange is characterized by intensely pruritic dermatitis. The pathogenicity of the mite has been attributed to its local irritant effect on the epidermis, but this does not readily explain the marked loss of condition induced by Psoroptes infestation in some species, particularly cattle. The detrimental systemic effects may derive directly or indirectly from a chronic hypersensitivity reaction rather than from local dermatitis. The histologic lesions, in which the predominant inflammatory cells in the superficial dermis are eosinophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes, are consistent with an allergic pathogenesis. Constant pruritus resulting from allergy markedly reduces feed intake, and secondary bacterial infection or myiasis may further contribute to loss of condition. There is little evidence to support the hypothesis that the mites inoculate a toxic compound along with their saliva.",

In rams, mites may be found on the scrotum or prepuce in small, dry lesions. Latency occurs in the summer months, when the fleece microclimate is less favorable to parasite proliferation. In autumn and winter or with debilitation of the host, the parasitic population explodes and lesions are induced. The withers and sides are particularly affected. The initial lesions are vesicles and yellow-green pustules that rupture, ooze, and develop into yellow crusts. The individual lesions expand at the periphery and may coalesce to become diffuse over most of the body surface. Fleece overlying the skin lesions becomes stained, moist, soiled, and matted.

Early lesions include papules, pustules, exudation, and excoriations. Infested areas are fairly well defined as areas of alopecia. Alopecic areas become lichenified and covered by dry gray crusts and scales. Severely affected variable degrees of superficial perivascular to interstitial dermatitis with numerous eosinophils.

Scott DW, Miller WH Inapparent infections allow persistence in the population. Pruritus is variable. It is absent to intense in the horse, goat, and cattle; tends to be intense in sheep; and tends to be absent to mild in alpacas. Lesions usually occur as erythema and papules progressing to scaling, oozing, crusts, and alopecia. In some cases, lesions may become lichenified, depending upon the duration of the disease and the degree of self-trauma inflicted. The condition is contagious and transmission occurs via direct and indirect contact. Chorioptic mange (foot mange, tail mange) is uncommon in cattle in most parts of the world. It predominantly affects housed dairy cows and is most prevalent in winter. Subclinical infections are probably quite common. The major clinical sign is pruritus, but this is not as severe as in sarcoptic or psoroptic mange. Chorioptic mange is, in general, a less serious condition than psoroptic mange in cattle, although a syndrome of highly pruritic coronitis was associated with falling milk production. The typical distribution of lesions is perineum, tail, scrotum, udder, and caudal areas of thigh, hindlimbs, and rump.

Demodex gatoi in cats lives in the superficial stratum corneum rather than in the follicles. In small numbers, Demodex spp. are normal inhabitants of the hair follicles and sebaceous glands in dogs, humans, and probably most mammals, and their position is invariably head-down. Transmission of follicular mites usually occurs from mother to young during the first 3 days of life through close physical contact while nursing. Demodex spp. are obligate parasites completing their life cycle on the host. Mites feed on cells, sebum, and epidermal debris. They are rapidly killed by desiccation on the surface of the skin, but mites move from follicle to follicle, and it is probably at this time paws, neck, or tailhead. Self-trauma and head shaking can lead to aural hematomas. The mites are contagious, particularly in young animals, and can live off the host for extended periods of time.

Two or more Demodex spp. can simultaneously parasitize the same mammalian host. Demodicosis or demodectic mange refers to a proliferation of mites associated with clinical signs and is often, but not always, associated with immunocompromise in the host. Canine demodicosis. Canine demodicosis (demodectic mange, follicular mange, red mange) is one of the most common skin disorders of dogs in North America. Two species of Demodex have been identified: D. canis (300 \u00b5m) and D. injai (the long-bodied mite, 334-368 \u00b5m) . Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that D. cornei (the short-tailed mite, 90-148 \u00b5m) should be considered a morphologic variant of D. canis rather than a separate species. Two types of demodicosis are generally recognized in dogs with D. canis infestations: localized and generalized. Localized demodicosis occurs as one to several, small, well-circumscribed, erythematous, scaly, nonpruritic to occasionally pruritic areas of alopecia, most commonly on the face (periocular and around lips) and forelegs ( Fig. 6-117A ). Most cases resolve spontaneously. In some cases, the condition is limited to the external ear canal, and these dogs have pruritic ceruminous otitis externa. Generalized demodecosis is defined as involvement of an entire body region, multiple localized regions or complete involvement of 2 paws or more. Generalized demodecosis usually starts between 3 and 18 months of age. Over time, lesions, as described above, enlarge and may coalesce to form patches. Follicular casts may be pronounced. Peripheral lymphadenopathy may be marked. Lesions that become secondarily infected with bacteria display edema, exudation, and crusting ( Fig. 6-117B) . In some cases, lesions are nodular, especially in English Bulldogs. Spontaneous resolution occurs in >50% of cases; however, if lesions do not spontaneously resolve and if the dog does not receive adequate treatment, lesions will likely continue into adulthood. This condition can be very severe and even fatal. Dogs that first develop the disease at 4 years of age or older are considered to have adult-onset generalized demodicosis. Disorders associated with adult-onset demodicosis include hypothyroidism, hyperglucocorticism, leishmaniasis, malignant neoplasia, and immunosuppressive therapy. In >50% of cases, no underlying disease can be documented at the time of demodicosis diagnosis but may become evident weeks to months into therapy.",

The disease is thought to be a genetically mediated specific immunodeficiency that allows the proliferation of Demodex mites. The condition is more common in purebred dogs, and breeds at risk include American Staffordshire Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and Shar Pei. Although some studies have suggested a decrease in T lymphocytes or premature apoptosis of peripheral blood leukocytes, most dogs are not lymphopenic, and rather, the problem is depressed T-cell function, not decreased numbers. It also appears that immune suppression is worse in those with secondary bacterial pyoderma. One study concluded that dogs with reoccurring demodicosis have higher interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels than healthy dogs and those suffering the disease for the first time. IL-10 can inhibit cytokine secretion by Th1 cells, including IL-1, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b2. IL-10 has anti-inflammatory and suppressive effects on most hematopoietic cells, and it indirectly suppresses cytokine production and proliferation of antigen-specific CD4+ T effector cells Dogs with infestations with D. injai generally have a different clinical presentation than those with D. canis. Terriers, especially the West Highland White Terrier, Shih Tzu, and Wirehaired Fox Terrier are predisposed. Most dogs are middleaged to older dogs with generalized disease that is characterized by mild to intense pruritus and greasy seborrhea, especially of the face and topline (Fig. 6-118A) . Erythema, hyperpigmentation, and comedones have been described, but hypotrichosis, alopecia, and secondary bacterial skin infections are rare. Many affected dogs have had prior histories of allergic dermatitis, immunosuppression, or immunomodulatory drug use.

Mast cells and eosinophils may be present in smaller numbers. Marked follicular hyperkeratosis is associated with variable numbers of mites in the upper third of the follicle. Mural folliculitis is also consistently present at later stages and in cases with secondary bacterial infection, but may not be the predominant pattern. In some cases, follicles may contain numerous mites but have no evidence of folliculitis, possibly indicating a poor immune response. Typically, large numbers of mites occupy the hair follicles at all levels and also occlude the opening of the sebaceous gland into the pilar canal. Marked follicular hyperkeratosis and build-up of mite products causes follicular plugging. Bacterial proliferation, chiefly Staphylococcus spp., within the plugged follicle often induces suppurative luminal folliculitis. The combined effects of follicular keratosis, mite proliferation, and folliculitis lead to follicular rupture and release of mites, bacteria, keratin, sebum, and other irritant products into the dermis. The keratin and other irritant substances stimulate a pyogranulomatous reaction, chiefly of neutrophils; epithelioid macrophages; and fewer multinucleated histiocytic giant cells. Epidermal lesions include hyperplasia, orthokeratotic and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, and variable spongiosis, neutrophilic exocytosis, ulceration, and inflammatory crusting. Longer-standing lesions consist of perifollicular mid to deep dermal or occasionally subcuticular granulomas, sometimes containing remnants of mites. Chronic lesions also have marked dermal fibrosis, often with obliteration of adnexa. Mites or fragments of mites are found in the subcapsular zone of regional lymph nodes associated with a local granulomatous inflammatory response. These do not indicate active invasion but rather passive transport to the node, via lymphatic channels. Through blood and lymph drainage, dead and degenerate mites in all stages can also be found in the spleen, lung, intestinal wall, liver, kidney, urinary bladder, thyroid gland, blood, urine, and feces.",

The preferred sites are the shoulders, neck, dewlap, and muzzle, but in heavy infestations, nodules may be present over most of the body. The content of the nodules is thick, waxy, or caseous material, sometimes stained with blood.

Histologically, the mite may be present in tunnels within the stratum spinosum or in the stratum corneum. The presence of the mites induces both hyperplastic and degenerative changes in the epidermis. The stylostome appears as a pale staining, hyalinized tube with undulating margins oriented vertical to the skin's surface and extending into the dermis. A large zone of necrotic cellular debris usually surrounds the stylostome. The surrounding dermis has a superficial perivascular infiltrate, with eosinophils and mast cells predominating.",

Ticks are small, attach firmly to their hosts, use multiple hosts, live for prolonged periods of time, and can often survive without feeding for long periods of time. These factors make ticks important in the possible transport and transmission of diseases from one host to another and between countries or continents. Importation of animals harboring ticks can pose a threat to animals in areas free of certain diseases.

Infective larvae of the filariids, such as Dirofilaria and Setaria, are deposited in the skin by the biting insects that are their vectors. The first percutaneous invasion of one of these parasites in its natural hosts takes place very quickly (for example, the larvae of Strongyloides and Bunostomum reach the dermis in 15 minutes) and provokes little reaction. Repeated invasions in a natural host or single invasion in an unnatural host are met with some resistance that is manifested as acute dermatitis limited to the invaded area. The cutaneous lesions are, except under experimental circumstances, seldom observed in animals. It is on the glabrous nonpigmented skin of people that they are easily observed and well recognized as the so-called \"creeping eruption.\" There the larvae produce acutely inflamed, serpiginous, vesicular to papular tracts that may advance several centimeters a day. Usually, aberrant larvae die in the skin, but some enter the vessels and become lodged in the lungs or other tissues. Nematode larvae most often incriminated are Ancylostoma braziliense, A. caninum, and Uncinaria stenocephala, the canine hookworm larvae.

Parafilaria bassoni has been reported in African buffalo and springbok in Namibia. The parasites are thin, thread-like worms, 2-7 cm long. The adults inhabit subcutaneous and intermuscular connective tissues producing nodules 1-2 cm in diameter. Lesions are most common over the neck, shoulders, and trunk, and pain and pruritus are variable. In the spring and summer, the nodules rapidly enlarge, burst open, hemorrhage, and heal. This coincides with the migration of the fully gravid female into the more superficial dermis to oviposit and to release infective microfilariae. The vectors, flies such as Haematobia atripalpis in Russia and Musca spp., are infected when they feed from these bleeding points, known as \"blood nodules.\" Secondary subcutaneous abscesses may occur. Gibbons LM, et The microscopic lesions reveal various degrees of superficial and deep perivascular to interstitial to diffuse dermatitis with numerous eosinophils. Microfilariae may be present in large numbers or may be very sparse (Fig. 6-122 ). Other reported histopathologic findings are eosinophilic mural and necrotizing folliculitis, palisaded eosinophilic granulomas, and deep dermal to subcutaneous lymphoid nodules. It is important to note that microfilariae can be seen in skin of normal horses, and thus histopathologic findings should be correlated with historical and physical examination findings. Microfilariae are best recovered from unfixed biopsies that are minced and incubated in saline at 37\u00b0 C.",

The parasite has been reported in dogs, cats, horses, and cattle as well as other species in endemic areas. Dracunculus insignis is the species of the nematode that occurs in dogs, cats, and wild carnivores in North America. Infection is particularly prevalent in raccoons and mink that appear to be the natural definitive species. The intermediate host is a crustacean copepod, but frogs may act as paratenic hosts. The definitive host ingests the intermediate host, and the larvae are released during digestion and proceed to migrate through the body. The adult worms mature in the connective tissue of the host in ~1 year. The parasite occurs typically in the subcutaneous tissues of the limbs. The mature female may measure up to 70 cm in length, resulting in the formation of a 2-4 cm nodule. Lesions are usually solitary occurring on the limbs and abdomen. The gravid female produces an intraepidermal bulla with her anterior end by means of toxin secretion. Rupture of the bulla forms a shallow ulcer from which a milky exudate drains. When these lesions contact water, the worm is stimulated to release very large numbers of larvae that are ingested by copepods in the water. Fine-needle aspiration of the cutaneous nodules reveals rhabditiform Dracunculus larvae, ~500 \u00b5m long and covered by a striated cuticle. The adults lie in a pseudocyst lined by fibrous connective tissue and infiltrated with eosinophils, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells. Ulcerated lesions are seen as draining tracts that may be painful or pruritic. The parasite can be identified by morphologic features. Parelaphostrongylus tenuis, a common parasite of whitetailed deer, is an occasional cause of neurologic disease in several domestic species, including goats, sheep, llamas, and alpacas. Some affected goats also develop an unusual dermatitis, often restricted to one side of the body.

Those worms that are found in the lesions are usually classified as Pelodera (Rhabditis) strongyloides. Pelodera dermatitis occurs most commonly in dogs, occasionally in cattle, and rarely in horses, sheep, and humans. Although most reported cases are sporadic, outbreaks involving multiple animals have been described in cattle and sheep. These worms live as saprophytes in warm moist soil that is rich in organic matter, and significant infestations probably require that the host's skin should be continually moist and filthy. Affected dogs often have a history of being bedded on straw. Pruritus is moderate to marked in most species, but is variable and can be absent in cattle. The lesions develop on contact areas (feet, legs, perineum, ventral trunk, tail) , particularly at the margins of areas caked with dirt. The gross lesions include erythema, papules, excoriations, scaling, exudation, and crusting, with partial to complete alopecia ( Fig. 6-123A) . Pustules may occur, particularly in dogs.

An underlying immune dysfunction is strongly suspected because the lesions are sterile when cultured, nontransmissible, and respond to corticosteroids and cyclosporine.

A series of 5 cases document a scabies-like, papular to nodular, variably ulcerated, pruritic dermatitis of the skin of the head, trunk, and extremities in dogs infected with D. immitis. Histologic examination of affected skin revealed angiocentric and pyogranulomatous dermatitis with intralesional microfilariae. The numbers of eosinophils is variable. A type II hypersensitivity response was proposed as a pathogenic mechanism based on positive immunoreaction of microfilariae with anti-IgG serum. Lesions resolved with antiparasitic treatment. Ectopic adult D. immitis have been recovered from cutaneous abscesses and interdigital cysts in parasitized dogs and cats. In addition, a generalized cutaneous syndrome characterized by a pruritic papular and crusting dermatitis without intralesional microfilariae has been apparently associated with infection with D. immitis and was thought to be a manifestation of an unusual hypersensitivity reaction. Parasites are not present in the cutaneous tissues. Lesions also resolved with antiparasitic treatment. Dirofilaria repens can cause subcutaneous dirofilariasis in dogs, cats, and wild carnivores in Europe and parts of Africa and Asia. Like D. immitis, mosquitoes are the intermediate host. During a mosquito's blood meal, L3 larvae penetrate into the subcutaneous tissues of a dog, where they molt to L4 and remain for 6-7 months before developing into adults. Adults are 5-17 cm in length. Adult nematodes are rarely found but are occasionally recovered from skin nodules. Other clinical signs include various degrees of erythema, papules, alopecia, scaling, and crusting. Acanthocheilonema (Dipetalonema) reconditum affects dogs in Europe, America, and Asia. Generally, it is not associated with clinical signs; however, there is one report of 10 dogs with an Acanthocheilonema-like parasite showing single to multiple pruritic papules and plaques with alopecia, scarring, erythema, ulceration, and crusting over the head, neck, and shoulders.

The tumor is suspected to trigger the production of autoantibodies. These types of paraneoplastic dermatoses must be differentiated from true autoimmune skin diseases as the prognosis may vary. Differentiation is based on ruling out the presence of an underlying neoplasm and resolution of the skin lesions with tumor removal. A subepidermal bullous stomatitis microscopically identical to bullous pemphigoid has been reported in a horse in association with a hemangiosarcoma. Immunoprecipitation studies indicated the horse had antibodies to desmoplakin I and II, the bullous pemphigoid 230 antigen, and a 190-kDa antigen. This immunoprecipitation profile was consistent with that reported for paraneoplastic pemphigus as reported in humans and the dog. Paraneoplastic pemphigus is a form of pemphigus that is sometimes associated with an underlying malignancy and has been previously discussed (see Immune-mediated dermatoses). Castellano MC, et al. Generalized often accumulates at mucocutaneous junctions and in interdigital spaces and clawbeds. Some lesions may have erythema, thickened skin, and marked crusting with alopecia. The condition is generally nonpruritic unless there is a secondary pyoderma or Malassezia dermatitis. Histologically, there is a cell-poor to cell-rich predominantly lymphocytic interface dermatitis with mild transepidermal and follicular apoptosis and marked orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, with patchy parakeratotic hyperkeratosis. The interface changes include Civatte bodies, hydropic degeneration, and pigmentary incontinence with a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate with fewer plasma cells and mast cells. Lymphocytic interface to infiltrative mural folliculitis is a consistent feature, and sebaceous glands are frequently reduced to absent. Some cases have been reported to also have an overgrowth of Malassezia pachydermatis and bacteria. It has been speculated that the presence of a thymoma initiates abnormal immunologic responses responsible for the dermatitis, which at times can resemble erythema multiforme or graft-versus-host dermatitis histologically. This condition has been reported in a rabbit and anecdotally in dogs. Necrolytic migratory erythema (hepatocutaneous syndrome, superficial necrolytic dermatitis) has been reported in dogs and occasionally the cat. The condition is sometimes associated with endocrine tumors of the pancreas (see Nutritional diseases of skin).",

Eosinophils are one of the major sources of inflammatory mediators associated with type I hypersensitivity reactions. Eosinophils can phagocytize small antigens, and they can kill large parasites by releasing toxic substances via degranulation. Eosinophils have 4 major granules containing a wide variety of proteins and enzymes: primary granules, secondary granules, small granules, and lipid bodies. Secondary granules contain major basic protein, eosinophilic cationic protein, eosinophilic peroxidase, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin. Small granules contain arylsulfatase and acid phosphatase. Lipid bodies are responsible for eicosanoid formation. Eosinophils also produce transforming growth factor-\u03b2 that is associated with chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Taken as a whole, the contents within eosinophil granules are responsible for inflammation and tissue destruction. They have profound vasoactive and neurogenic properties that manifest clinically as erythema, wheals, and pruritus. Eosinophilic inflammation in the horse and cat is a common tissue reaction, and it seems that the chemotactic stimuli that attract neutrophils in most species attract both eosinophils and neutrophils in these 2 species.",

These lesions can occur separately or together and, rather than a specific disease, are considered a mucocutaneous reaction pattern. In most cases, an underlying allergic etiology, particularly to environmental allergens, food, and insect bites (fleas and mosquitoes), are suspected. In human patients with severe atopic dermatitis (AD), there is some evidence to suggest that although the disease is initiated by environmental allergens, some patients may form IgE antibodies directed against human proteins (self-antigens) generated through self-trauma from scratching. Felis domesticus allergen I (Feld I) could be an autoallergen responsible for chronic inflammatory reaction in cats with EGC. And in other cases, the lesions spontaneously resolve and do not recur, making allergy an unlikely trigger in those cases. Bacterial involvement may be a significant factor, especially with indolent ulcers and eosinophilic plaques, and in some cases, lesions resolve with antibiotic therapy alone. In some cases, the oral and lip lesions are thought to be due to embedded foreign material such as insects or plants. Because this condition has been reported in several groups of related cats, there is some evidence to suggest heritable eosinophil dysregulation.

The cause of multisystemic, eosinophilic, epitheliotropic disease is unknown. A genetic basis has been proposed; Standardbreds and Thoroughbreds are overrepresented. Recurrent episodes of type I hypersensitivity caused by dietary, inhaled, or parasitic antigens has been suggested in several reports. There is one report of this condition occurring concurrently with intestinal lymphoma, and several other unpublished cases that appear identical to the case described; the authors suggest that the clonal proliferation of T lymphocytes triggers proliferation of eosinophils by secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-5. This mechanism has also been proposed in humans who have concurrent abnormal T-lymphocyte proliferations and hypereosinophilic syndrome. Affected horses often display severe weight loss, pitting edema, and exudative, exfoliative dermatitis that usually originates at the coronary bands or head and becomes generalized. Chronically, there is scaling, crusting, and alopecia. Early findings include well-demarcated ulcers on the coronary bands, muzzle, mucocutaneous junctions, and mouth. Vesicles, bullae, and wheals are rarely noted. Pruritus is variable, and peripheral lymph nodes may be enlarged. Approximately 50% of horses have diarrhea and fever. Peripheral eosinophilia is only present in ~14% of cases. Histologically, the condition is characterized by eosinophilic and lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of multiple organs, sometimes with eosinophilic granuloma formation. Organs most commonly affected include skin, pancreas, liver, common bile duct, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. In the skin, the inflammatory pattern is variable, including perivascular, lichenoid interface, interstitial, diffuse, and granulomatous. Eosinophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells predominate. There is marked epidermal hyperplasia with hyperkeratosis that is orthokeratotic and parakeratotic. An epitheliotropic infiltrate of eosinophils and lymphocytes is common, and apoptotic keratinocytes may be prominent. Eosinophilic folliculitis, furunculosis, and eosinophilic microabscesses may be seen. Collagen flame figures and lymphoid nodules are seen occasionally. Most horses suffer a chronic course of progressive weight loss and dermatitis and die or are euthanized within 8 months of diagnosis. Bosseler L, et (Fig. 6-129) . Other histologic features include eosinophilic folliculitis and furunculosis, lymphoid nodules, and dystrophic mineralization. The granulomatous process is fairly linear in silicone-needle injection reactions. Free hair shafts within the lesion suggest previous close-clipping. Axillary nodular necrosis (girth galls) is a rare dermatosis of the horse. The cause and pathogenesis are unknown.

Postinjection panniculitis also occurs with focal necrosis in the subcutis, but this area is surrounded by predominantly foamy macrophages and multinucleated histiocytic giant cells. Rabies vaccine-induced panniculitis is discussed under Immunemediated dermatoses. (Fig. 6-133 ). Affected animals with single lesions may be asymptomatic; animals with multiple lesions often have pyrexia, lethargy, and anorexia. Pain is variable. A normochromic, normocytic nonregenerative anemia is seen in chronically affected animals with multiple extensive lesions. Some cases spontaneously regress. Most lesions in dogs and cats respond to immunosup- thought that there are 3 phases and 3 distinct forms of laminitis. The 3 phases are developmental, acute, and chronic. Laminitis is a cutaneous manifestation of a systemic problem, and thus there are many risk factors and potential causes that can be categorized into 3 forms. \u2022 The first form is inflammatory laminitis, which includes starch/grain overload; black walnut-induced laminitis, sepsis, and systemic inflammation caused by gastrointestinal disease; pneumonia; and septic metritis. Following release of inflammatory toxins, there is degradation of the lamellar basement membrane and dyshesion of the epithelial cells from the basement membrane. There is matrix metalloproteinase activation and leukocyte infiltration as well as profound hemodynamic changes. \u2022 Endocrinopathic laminitis/laminopathy is the second form and includes horses with insulin resistance, obesity, pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction, and possibly corticosteroid-induced laminitis. This form is characterized by little if any inflammation and stretching of the secondary epidermal lamellae as opposed to early separation from the basement membrane. This will still lead to eventual basement membrane separation at the tips of the secondary epidermal lamellae. \u2022 The third form, contralateral limb laminitis/laminopathy, is thought to be initiated by poor blood flow and ischemia and likely involves subsequent enzyme activation and degradation of the lamellar basement membrane in conjunction with the effects of tension and stretch on the lamellar tissues. These different forms of laminitis are not entirely exclusive. Laminitis is a syndrome with many contributing factors, and although there may be different pathways, the common lesion in all forms of the disease is dermal-epidermal separation at the interface of the lamellar basal epithelial cells and the underlying basement membrane and dermis.",

The basement membrane of the secondary laminae detaches first in the region of parabasal cell attachment and subsequently in the region of the basal cells, leaving aggregates of degenerating basement membrane components within the connective tissue space between the laminae. Loss of the basement membrane leads to separation of the dermal and epidermal laminae of the hoof wall and is crucial in loss of structural integrity of the P3/hoof wall attachment. Collapse of secondary laminae leads to loss of capillaries normally present within the connective tissue between the epidermal laminae. The loss of capillaries leads to increased resistance to blood flow, arteriovenous shunting, and eventual ischemic damage. This early stage is characterized clinically by a bounding digital pulse.",

Some, such as those occurring in Rhodesian Ridgeback dogs, actually retain a sinus pore to the skin surface (see Congenital and hereditary diseases of skin). Dermoid cysts are common in some families of Boxer dogs, and affected animals have multiple cysts along the midline of the skin over the forehead. In the horse, dermoid cysts occur most often on the midline between the withers and the rump. Dermoid cysts contain keratin and hair fragments and sometimes sebaceous secretions.

They may be single or multiple, smooth, most often unilocular, spherical dermal papules or nodules seldom larger than 1 cm in diameter. The keratin may appear as loose flakes. Infundibular cysts may arise from dilation of the infundibulum of occluded hair follicles, and indeed, occasionally one can detect superficial dermal scarring that may support this hypothesis. As well, such cysts may contain fragments of mature hair shafts. One report in the dog documents multiple squamous cell carcinomas arising from multiple infundibular cysts. Some cysts are thought to arise from traumatic, developmental, or surgical implantation of epidermal fragments into dermis or subcutis.

However, for viral replication to occur, infected cells must become terminally differentiated, and therefore PVs attempt to increase both proliferation of basal cells and terminal keratinocyte differentiation. PV types are grouped into genera. Most of the >100 human PVs (HPVs) are classified as alpha or beta PVs. Alpha-PV genus includes the oncogenic mucosal types. The beta-PV genus contains cutaneous PVs that are usually associated with immunosuppression. The delta-PV type is important in nonhuman mammals because it is associated with benign fibropapillomas in both ungulates and cats. Although most papillomaviruses are species specific, delta-PVs have the unique ability to infect multiple species.",

Lesions can be anatomically extensive and multiple. The stratum corneum exhibits variable degrees of orthokeratotic to parakeratotic hyperkeratosis. Most of the hyperplasia is due to marked expansion of stratum spinosum cells, which have pale basophilic cytoplasm. Cells of the spinous and/or granular layer have swollen eosinophilic to lightly basophilic cytoplasm (ballooning degeneration) and enlarged, condensed, or multiple nuclei (koilocytes) (Fig.  6-136B) . Degenerating keratinocytes may have condensed eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions that represent aggregates of keratin, a result of the viral cytopathic effect. These inclusions should not be confused with the cytoplasmic inclusions associated with poxvirus infections. The stratum granulosum has large, variably sized and shaped basophilic keratohyaline granules. Cells of the stratum spinosum and granulosum may have vesicular nuclei with intranuclear pale basophilic viral inclusions that contain virus particles visible with electron A B keratomatous papilloma has been described in association with PV in an 8-month-old Simmental calf. Many factors are involved, including viral proteins that promote cell dysregulation and immune evasion. BPVs are composed of early (E) and late (L) genes. E5, E6, and E7 are the transforming proteins. E5 is the major BPV transforming oncoprotein. It is believed to be critical in driving cell transformation, especially by activating platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2). The binding of BPV-1 E5 to PDGFR\u03b2 results in activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKTcyclin D pathway, leading to cell cycle deregulation. BPV-1 can also down-regulate the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) through the E2 and E7 oncoproteins. TLR-4 downregulation is expected to contribute to immune evasion and viral persistence. In conjunction with several BPVs (BPV-1, BPV-2, and BPV-4), the ingestion of bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) has been associated with various epithelial and mesenchymal urinary bladder neoplasms. This plant is known to promote genomic instability, resistance to apoptosis, and cell cycle deregulation by inactivating p53 and activating ras and preventing the immune system from clearing viral papillomas.",

An angio- and inguinal plaques, and EcPV-7 was isolated from an undiagnosed penile mass in a horse. Congenital papillomas have been reported in foals (see the section Hamartomas). The most important papillomavirus-induced lesion in the horse is the sarcoid, known to be associated with BPV-1, BPV-2, and most recently BPV-13. Sarcoids are locally aggressive, nonmetastatic fibroblastic skin tumors of horses, mules, donkeys, and zebras. They are the most common skin tumor of horses, accounting for up to 90% of tumors. A combination of factors appears to be involved in development of the tumors, including exposure to a viral agent, cutaneous trauma, and a genetic predilection. Viral etiology has been deduced based on reports of epizootics of cases, transmission studies, detection of viral particles in cultured tumor cells, and demonstration of DNA sequences very similar or identical to that of BPV-1 or BPV-2 genome in tumor cells of horses and donkeys. BPV DNA has been demonstrated in normal skin of healthy horses and horses with inflammatory conditions, suggesting that there are more factors involved in sarcoid development than simply viral infection. Sarcoids frequently develop in areas subjected to trauma or at sites of wounds 6-8 months after wound healing. In horses, there is a breed predilection for Appaloosas, Quarter Horses, Arabians, and Thoroughbreds and a lower incidence in Standardbreds and Lipizzaners. In Thoroughbreds and Warmbloods, the increased risk has been associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-1 A3 and W13 alleles, whereas, in Standardbreds and Lipizzaners, a decreased risk is associated with decreased W13 allele and a lack of W13, respectively.",

The tumors are classified according to their gross appearance as occult, verrucous, nodular, fibroblastic, mixed, and malignant (malevolent) . Many horses have multiple tumors, and all types of sarcoids can be present in the same horse. Occult sarcoids are focal areas with alopecia, scaling, hyperkeratosis, and hyperpigmentation ( Fig. 6-139A ). Common locations are neck, face, sheath, medial thigh, and shoulder. The verrucous sarcoid is a small wart-like growth, usually measuring <6 cm in diameter, with a dry, rough surface and variable alopecia ( Fig. 6-139B ). This type is usually found in the head, neck, axilla, and groin. Nodular sarcoids are spherical dermal to subcutaneous masses. The overlying skin may be normal but can become alopecic and ulcerated. This type is common on the eyelid, groin, and prepuce. The fibroblastic sarcoid is more variable in appearance and may range from a well-circumscribed firm nodule with intact surface to large masses, >25 cm in diameter, with an ulcerated surface prone to hemorrhage and resembling exuberant granulation tissue. Common locations are axilla, groin, legs, and periocular. Malignant/malevolent sarcoids are aggressive and locally invasive. These tumors extend widely into the adjacent skin and subcutis and infiltrate lymphatic vessels. The occult and verrucous and, to a lesser extent, the nodular sarcoid can remain static for years if not traumatized. Any type of sarcoid lesion can develop into an aggressive fibroblastic or malignant/ malevolent tumor if traumatized. Spontaneous remission is rare. The tumors are characterized by a high rate of recurrence, up to 50%, following surgical excision.",

There is a fairly orderly progression from polyhedral, nonkeratinized basal cells at the periphery of the neoplastic epithelial structures to large polygonal keratinized cells at the centers. Neoplastic cells have vesicular nuclei with one or multiple very prominent nucleoli. Cytoplasm is usually abundant and eosinophilic. There is often a desmoplastic reaction in the surrounding dermis.

Sunlight is probably the most important carcinogenic stimulus for these tumors. The action of sunlight may be related to overexpression of p53 protein as a result of ultraviolet (UV)-induced mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Chronic sun exposure, lack of pigment, and thin haircoat in the area of tumor development are predisposing factors. In these cases, SCC is usually preceded by actinic keratosis and is seen more frequently in geographic regions exposed to long periods of intense sunlight (see Actinic diseases of skin). Affected animals are usually middle aged to older. In cats, predilection sites for UV-induced SCC are eyelids, pinnae, and nasal planum ( Fig. 6-145 ). In dogs, the ventral trunk, digits, limbs, scrotum, and lips are the most common sites. The nasal planum is rarely affected, and when it is affected, it is usually secondary to depigmentation from a chronic inflammatory condition, such as discoid lupus erythematosus. Subungual squamous cell carcinomas in dogs may be multiple and are seen most often in black dogs, particularly large breeds such as Labrador Retrievers and Standard Poodles. Although papillomaviruses have been a suspected etiology, one study did not support a viral pathogenesis. In horses, the periocular region, penis, and perianal regions are predilection sites, and Appaloosas, American Paint horses, Quarter Horses, and males are predisposed. In cattle, Herefords and Ayrshires are at increased risk, and lesions are most common on the face, eyelids, pinnae, back, vulva, and distal legs. In goats, Angoras and Boers may be at increased risk, and lesions are most common in sparsely haired skin of the udder, perianal region, horn base, pinnae, vulva, and eyelid.

These are rare, welldemarcated masses in the dermis to subcutis composed of multiple lobules and trabeculae and areas of cystic degeneration. Small epithelial cells form anastomosing cords similar to the ribbon type, and these merge into islands of cells with markedly vacuolated cytoplasm resembling anagen suprabulbar outer root sheath or pale pink isthmustype keratinocytes that line the cystic zones. Pilomatricoma (pilomatrixoma, epithelioma of Malherbe, necrotizing and calcifying epithelioma) is an uncommon benign tumor of dogs and is believed to be derived from primitive hair matrix and thus shows incomplete differentiation towards hair cortex. This tumor macroscopically resembles trichoepithelioma but is often more heavily mineralized and consists of fewer, larger cysts than does trichoepithelioma. They usually occur as single, firm to hard, raised, 1-10 cm diameter nodules most commonly on the proximal legs and dorsal trunk over the rump and shoulders. Poodles, Kerry Blue Terriers, and Old English Sheepdogs and other breeds with continuously growing coats, and thus a higher proportion of anagen follicles, are predisposed. The typical microscopic morphology is of one or more large, thick-walled cysts partially filled with so-called shadow or ghost cells (Fig. 6-149) typical of matrical differentiation. These cells are flattened eosinophilic epithelial cells with a central empty halo in place of the lysed nucleus. The cyst wall is composed of multiple layers of basal cells, resembling matrical epithelium of the hair bulb, and showing a sudden zonal degeneration to form the central laminations of shadow cells. Small zones of squamous epithelium may be seen. Small foci resembling rounded dermal papilla-like structures may be present in the cyst wall. These tumors are not connected to the overlying epidermis. There is sparse collagenous to mucinous stroma. Mitotic activity may arranged as islands, and radiating cords that may intersect or be associated with the epidermis. The tumor cells show central trichilemmal cornification. The granular layer is absent.",

As in nodular hyperplasia, perianal gland metaplasia is rarely observed. There may be compression of adjacent structures. Melanization in reserve cells is common in eyelid tumors. Sebaceous epitheliomas are grossly similar to sebaceous adenomas. They are common in dogs, occurring most commonly in Shih Tzus and Lhasa Apsos. Histologically, these masses are composed of multiple large irregular lobules of epithelial reserve cells with multiple small foci of distinct sebaceous differentiation (Fig. 6-150) .

These lesions, especially Meibomian epitheliomas, are variably pigmented. This tumor is considered to be a low-grade malignancy. Sebaceous and Meibomian epitheliomas may recur if incompletely excised; rarely, sebaceous epitheliomas have been reported to invade lymphatics and metastasize to regional lymph nodes and, in one case, lung and central nervous system.

These lesions are usually solitary, firm nodules, up to 7 cm in diameter and most common on the head. Ulceration and alopecia are common.

Sebocytic carcinomas are multilobular dermal masses that are irregular in shape but well circumscribed and may extend into the subcutis. Neoplastic cells are polygonal and larger than basal reserve cells. Orderly progression from basaloid reserve cells to mature sebocytes is markedly distorted or absent. Neoplastic cells are pleomorphic with eosinophilic cytoplasm that is variably vacuolated. Nuclei are large with prominent nucleoli, and mitotic activity is moderate to high. There may be atypical mitotic figures. Other possible features include ulceration, necrosis, cystic degeneration, squamous differentiation, keratinization, or occasional glandular structures. Epitheliomatous sebaceous carcinomas are composed predominantly of slightly larger and more pleomorphic than normal basaloid reserve be high. Mineralization of shadow cells is very common, and cyst rupture results in the pyogranulomatous inflammation that is very typical of these tumors. Foci of necrosis within the tumor are frequently seen, and mineralization or even ossification within the stroma occurs occasionally.

Histologically, the tumor is a combination of a junctional melanocytoma with a benign epithelial tumor. The epithelial population forms a mass in the dermis composed of cords and nests with occasional small cystic structures containing keratin. Melanocytic cells form nests in the epidermis and sometimes in the cords of epithelial cells within the dermal mass; melanocytic spindle cells can form whorls and bundles between the epithelial cords and nests.",

            "text": "Malignant melanomas are generally tumors of older animals; however, they have been reported in juvenile animals of many species. Criteria for malignancy and prognosis are described in the introduction to this section; in the dog, a mitotic index of 3 or greater appears to be the most accurate predictor of a poor prognosis. In addition, several studies have indicated that the degree of pigmentation and the histologic pattern are not correlated with prognosis. Malignant melanomas can be composed of a variety of cell morphologies, including spindle cells, epithelioid cells, a mixture of spindle cells and epithelioid cells, signet-ring cells, or balloon cells (clear cells). In addition, the cells can be heavily pigmented or amelanotic and form bundles, sheets, nests, and whorled patterns. Focal areas of chondroid or osseous metaplasia within the tumor may be seen on rare occasion. The most common types of malignant melanoma are composed of epithelioid cells, a mixture of epithelioid and spindle cells, or spindle cells alone, forming an unencapsulated mass in the dermis or subcutis. Various degrees of junctional activity may be present in the epithelioid cell form and in the mixed epithelioid-spindle cell form. The epithelioid cells tend to form clusters and nests, and the spindle cells tend to form sheets, bundles, or whorls. The neoplastic cells have variable nuclear pleomorphism, usually single prominent basophilic nucleoli, 3 or more mitotic figures per 10 HPFs (400\u00d7), and mitotic atypia (Fig. 6-157) . Cytoplasm is generally moderate to abundant, and the degree of pigmentation is highly variable, from darkly pigmented to amelanotic. An infrequent form of spindle cell melanoma, composed entirely of amelanotic spindle cells, can be impossible to distinguish from fibrosarcoma or neurofibrosarcoma without the aid of immunohistochemistry. Although the epithelioid and spindle cell forms of melanoma are usually pigmented to some degree, the uncommon balloon cell form and signet-ring cell form are usually unpigmented or poorly pigmented. current recommendation is to perform immunohistochemical labeling with Melan-A, PNL2, TRP-1, and TRP-2 as single antibodies, or as a cocktail.",

Ulcerated regions should be avoided. Oral and lip tumors that are heavily pigmented and composed of well-differentiated melanocytes with a low mitotic index (<4/10 HPFs) have a favorable prognosis.

Vaccination site fibrosarcomas have also been reported in ferrets and putatively in dogs. The interval between vaccination and tumor development is 3 months to 3.5 years. The mechanism of tumor development is unknown, but persistent injection-site-induced inflammation leading to deranged fibrous connective tissue repair response and eventual neoplastic transformation in genetically predisposed cats has been postulated. Alterations in oncogene and growth factor expression may be involved in the pathogenesis. Postvaccinal fibrosarcomas typically develop in the subcutis of the dorsal cervical and interscapular area, dorsal and lateral thorax, flank, and musculature of the thigh, locations that are all common vaccination sites. These tumors arise in cats that are cutaneous blood vessels (angioleiomyomas), and specialized muscles of genital skin. These tumors are usually solitary, firm, and well-circumscribed in animals. In humans, piloleiomyomas are commonly multiple; and multiple piloleiomyomas have been reported in an old cat. Microscopically, leiomyomas are small, well-circumscribed dermal masses adjacent to and surrounding hair follicles. They are composed of uniform long spindle cells in whorling and interlacing bundles. The cells have bland elongate nuclei with blunt ends (\"cigar-shaped\") and moderately abundant pale eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic figures are rare. Leiomyosarcomas exhibit nuclear pleomorphism and low to moderate mitotic activity. Angioleiomyomas consist of interlacing bundles of smooth muscle cells between numerous vascular channels. Smooth muscle tumors may be confused with fibromas, fibrosarcomas, or malignant schwannomas. In such cases, immunohistochemical staining for actin and desmin can confirm muscle origin.",

More than 70% of CCH occur in dogs <4 years of age and are most often found on the head (pinna), but can occur anywhere on the body at any age. There is no sex predilection. Boxers and Dachshunds are predisposed. Grossly, the tumors are raised, red, frequently ulcerated and alopecic, 0.5-4 cm, papular to nodular lesions that grow rapidly. Metastasis of a solitary histiocytoma to a local lymph node has been reported, and in all reported cases with follow-up, there was spontaneous regression. The tumors are well demarcated but unencapsulated and located primarily in the dermis, with the base of the tumor smaller in configuration than the more superficial aspect (\"top heavy\"). Microscopically, tumor cells form diffuse sheets that displace adnexal structures and dermal collagen, and extend from the epidermis and superficial dermis into the dermis. Care must be taken to differentiate the lesion from epitheliotropic lymphoma. The epidermis is often attenuated or ulcerated, and associated edema may lead to vertical rowing of tumor cells near the surface. Ulceration is associated with infiltrates of neutrophils. The intact epidermis may be hyperplastic. Individual tumor cells are round to oval with moderate to abundant eosinophilic, slightly foamy cytoplasm. Nuclei are centrally located, round to oval, indented or convoluted with vesicular chromatin, and most often have a single nucleolus that may be inconspicuous. Mitotic figures are variable but most often numerous, with up to 10-15/HPF. The base of the tumor may have infiltrates of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, a sign of host-mediated spontaneous tumor regression. Infiltrates of lymphocytes may also be found in perivascular or periadnexal regions. In older lesions, the lymphocytic infiltrates may be more extensive than the remaining tumor cell infiltrates, leading to a misinterpretation of primary inflammatory process or inflamed nonepitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma. Tumor cell apoptosis and zones of necrosis are common findings, particularly in regressing lesions but are not present in all CCH.

Shar-Peis are also predisposed and, in this breed, mast cell tumors often occur at an earlier age than in other breeds. The macroscopic appearance of canine mast cell tumors varies widely with their stage of progression and degree of histologic differentiation. Well-differentiated tumors most often appear as a rubbery, nodular nonencapsulated variably alopecic dermal mass 1-4 cm in diameter that clinically resembles a lipoma. Poorly differentiated tumors tend to achieve a large size more quickly, are less circumscribed, and often associated with inflammation and edema of the surrounding dermis and possible satellite lesions.

The ligand for KIT is stem cell factor (KIT ligand, mast cell growth factor). Activating mutations in KIT as well as aberrant c-kit expression has been demonstrated in canine MCTs. Approximately 15-40% of MCTs show c-kit mutations, including internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxtamembrane domain, resulting in constitutive activation of KIT in the absence of ligand binding and activating point mutations in c-kit extracellular domains. Canine mast cell tumors that are positive for the activating duplication mutation in exon 11 have a shorter disease-free interval and shorter survival times than tumors without the c-kit mutation. Tumors with mutations in exon 8 or 11 have an increased likelihood of therapeutic success with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The Kit staining pattern and protein location also has prognostic significance. The staining is defined as follows: pattern 1 (perimembrane), pattern II (focal or stippled cytoplasmic staining), and pattern III (diffuse cytoplasmic staining).

Less commonly, the tumor appears as a poorly defined area of swelling resulting from an infiltrative rather than nodular lesion. The head and neck are preferred sites. There are 2 histologic subtypes: the mastocytic type and the histiocytic (atypical) type. Histologically, the cells are usually extraordinarily uniform, polygonal to round, and grow in a diffuse sheet interrupted only by small clusters of lymphocytes and rare eosinophils. The cytoplasm is clear, eosinophilic, or only faintly basophilic. Obvious granularity is infrequent. The nucleus is round, central, and relatively hyperchromatic compared with that of canine mast cells. Even with metachromatic stains, such as Giemsa or toluidine blue, cytoplasmic granules may stain poorly, yet ultrastructurally they are abundant. Occasionally, binucleated, multinucleated, or (see Fig. 6-163A ). Dermal involvement varies from a mixed perivascular cellular component that contains low numbers of neoplastic lymphocytes to a more fulminating diffuse monomorphic neoplastic infiltrate. CTCL frequently causes ulcers, and verification of the epitheliotropic nature of the neoplasm can be difficult; however, a neoplastic lymphocytic component that abuts the ulcerated epidermis suggests epidermotropism. The neoplastic lymphocytes can vary from a small cell type, with a low mitotic index, hyperchromatic nucleus, and scant cytoplasm, to a large cell type, with moderate mitotic index together with moderate amounts of pale basophilic to clear cytoplasm. Although less well characterized than the human form of mycosis fungoides, epitheliotropic lymphomas in domestic animals also express T-cell surface antigens such as CD3. In contrast to human epitheliotropic lymphomas, which are reported to express CD4 in ~90% of cases as well as \u03b1\u03b2 T-cell receptor, 80% of epitheliotropic lymphomas in domestic animals express CD8 and the \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell receptor. CTCL with a leukemic blood component (S\u00e9zary syndrome) has been reported in the dog, cat, horse, and cow. Canine pagetoid reticulosis (Woringer-Kolopp disease) is a localized solitary plaque form of epitheliotropic lymphoma that is well vesicular nuclei and numerous mitotic figures that are often atypical. Because the neoplastic population is often the minority population, the mitotic index should be evaluated carefully, taking into account the fact that the majority population is non-neoplastic small T lymphocytes with normal morphology and low mitotic index. These tumors also usually contain macrophages, epithelioid macrophages, and occasionally multinucleated giant cells. The mixed nature of the population can lead to this tumor being mistaken for inflammation, or a neoplasm of T lymphocytes.

Pulmonary carcinoma is the most common cause of tumor metastasis to the skin in cats. Pulmonary carcinomas in the cat have a propensity to metastasize to the digits, often prior to onset of clinical signs referable to the primary tumor. Clinically, the lesions are suggestive of paronychia. Histologically, nests, solid sheets, and glandular structures formed by malignant epithelial cells are found in the dermis and subcutis. Bony lysis of the third phalanx may be evident radiographically and histologically. Tumor cells have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, basally oriented nuclei, and frequently, apical cilia. Squamous differentiation is also common. Desmoplasia is usually present.",

            "text": "Tumors metastatic to the skin A variety of tumors can metastasize to the skin, but the process is uncommon. Cutaneous metastasis may be the first sign of an undiagnosed visceral malignancy. The usual routes of lymphatic, hematogenous, or implantation from a surgical procedure apply. A thorough search for a primary tumor, knowledge of prior history of a tumor, and an awareness of a few unique tumor patterns of metastasis are necessary to help establish the condition as a metastatic process. Clinically, a wide array of cutaneous lesions have been reported, including erythema, papules, pustules, vesicles, dermal to subcutaneous nodules, and ulcers. Cutaneous metastases in dogs have been reported to occur with the following neoplasms: transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), mammary carcinoma, mast cell tumors, lymphoma, hemangiosarcoma, duodenal and colonic adenocarcinoma, gastric mucinous adenocarcinoma, inflammatory mammary carcinosarcoma, seminoma, osteosarcoma, nasal neuroendocrine carcinoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Cutaneous metastasis of transitional cell carcinoma is uncommon in dogs; however, it has been reported to occur after previous abdominal surgery for TCC and to occur through lymphatics and blood vessels. Transepidermal metastasis has been suggested, because in most cases, cutaneous lesions are in close proximity to the vulva and prepuce. Some believe neoplastic cells from the urine may seed eroded urine scalded skin. Cutaneous lesions appear as plaques, papules, and nodules and most often occur in the perineal, inguinal, or ventral abdominal dermis or subcutis in dogs with or without history of surgery. Many affected dogs also have lymph node and distant metastasis.",

Microscopically, the tumors are comprised of dermal infiltrates of round cells arranged as solid nests or clusters separated by collagenous stroma. Individual tumor cells are reported to have indistinct margins and moderate amounts of pale to vacuolated cytoplasm. The nuclei are oval or spherical with dispersed chromatin. The nucleolus may or may not be conspicuous. Anisocytosis is mild to moderate. Mitotic activity varies. Differential diagnoses include round cell tumors, such as cutaneous plasmacytoma, balloon cell melanocytoma, and metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma. Definitive diagnosis requires ultrastructural examination or immunohistochemistry. Merkel cell tumors label for cytokeratin (CK), CK20, chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, and synaptophysin. Cytokeratin 20 is specific for Merkel cells and has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma in the cat. CK 20 is a low-molecular-weight cytokeratin whose expression is restricted to the gastrointestinal epithelium, urothelium, and Merkel cell. Electron microscopic evaluation demonstrates electron-dense-core granules typical of neuroendocrine cells. Merkel cell tumors in the dog are most often benign, with only one report documenting metastasis",

Lumpy skin disease, caused by species Lumpy skin disease virus of the genus Capripoxvirus, is a disease of cattle, buffalo, and occasionally other wild species of hoofstock, characterized by the eruption of multiple, multilocular, yield only a small amount of fluid if punctured.Occasionally a large vesicle forms as a result of cleavage of necrotic epidermis from underlying dermis. The pustule stage is characterized by the formation of a thin crust. In severely affected animals, the lesions coalesce. There may be marked, gelatinous dermal edema. Highly susceptible animals often develop hemorrhagic papules early in the course of the disease and, later, ulcerative lesions in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.

Clinical features of many endocrine dermatoses include a dry, coarse, brittle, dull, easily epilated haircoat that fails to regrow after clipping; hypotrichosis and hyperpigmentation; and alopecia that is frequently bilaterally symmetrical. Secondary pyoderma and scaling are common. In addition, endocrine dermatoses share many histologic features, including orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, follicular dilation and keratosis, hair follicle atrophy, absence of hair shafts in follicles, increased numbers of telogen follicles, variably increased trichilemmal cornification (flame follicles) of follicles, and epidermal hyperpigmentation. These histologic changes suggest an endocrine dermatosis but frequently are not pathognomonic for a specific endocrinopathy. A combination of clinical and histologic features, together with clinical testing to demonstrate hormonal deficiency or excess, is required for confirmation.Hypothyroidism, almost always primary hypothyroidism, is the most common endocrine dermatopathy in dogs. Histologically, the thyroid gland may have lymphoplasmacytic inflammation (lymphocytic thyroiditis) or atrophy without inflammation (idiopathic atrophy). Lymphocytic thyroiditis has been likened to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, a similar immunemediated condition in humans. Idiopathic thyroid atrophy may represent the end stage of lymphocytic thyroiditis. In addition, hypothyroidism may be caused by developmental defects of the thyroid gland and rarely iodine deficiency. Congenital hypothyroidism with goiter has been reported in Tenterfield Terriers, as well as Toy Fox and Rat Terriers. The cause, so-called dyshormonogenesis, is caused by failure of the thyroid gland to produce sufficient hormone to inhibit pituitary release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Pituitary neoplasia, or hypopituitarism, resulting in decreased secretion of TSH can lead to secondary hypothyroidism. It is a disease of middle-aged dogs, and there is no sex predilection, although the incidence is increased in neutered males and ovariohysterectomized females. Breeds that are predisposed include the Doberman Pinscher, Golden Retriever, Chow Chow, Great Dane, Irish Wolfhound, Boxer, English Bulldog, Dachshund, Afghan Hound, Newfoundland, Alaskan Malamute, Brittany Spaniel, Poodle, Irish Setter, and Miniature Schnauzer.",

Some poxviruses, for example Pseudocowpox virus, are zoonotic. Infection is usually achieved by cutaneous or respiratory routes. Poxviruses, whether acquired by the subcutaneous or respiratory routes, usually gain access to the systemic circulation via the lymphatic system, although multiplication at the site of injection in the skin may lead to direct entry into the blood and primary viremia. Secondary viremia disseminates the virus back to the skin and to other target organs.Poxviruses induce lesions by a variety of mechanisms. Degenerative changes in the epithelium are caused by virus replication and induce vesicular lesions typical of many poxvirus infections. Degenerative lesions in the dermal or submucosal tissues sometimes result from ischemia secondary toFenner F, et al. Veterinary Virology. 2nd  ed. San Diego: Academic Press; 1993. Tang KN, et al.

Cutaneous nocardiosis in two dogs receiving ciclosporin therapy for the management of canine atopic dermati-Organisms are characteristically rare and difficult to find but are usually located in small clumps within the clear vacuoles.Small numbers of organisms may also be found within macrophages. The bacilli may stain more intensely with modified acid-fast stain than with routine acid-fast stain. In some instances, staining frozen sections of formalin-fixed tissue may result in enhanced acid-fast staining. The organisms are long rods to short filamentous bacilli. Intracellular bacteria tend to be shorter rods. The organisms stain unevenly positive with tissue Gram stains, resulting in a beaded appearance to the bacilli. Because of the scarcity of organisms, any single section may lack organisms, and the diagnosis will be missed. In rare instances, fibroplasia may be marked, and the lesion may be confused for a spindle cell tumor.The specific diagnosis of opportunistic mycobacterial infection requires identification by culture or molecular-based techniques. Because of the scarcity of organisms in some lesions, diagnosis may require multiple attempts at biopsy, culture, and PCR. Feline leprosy. Feline leprosy is a rare localized cutaneous infection caused by mycobacteria that are not culturable by standard mycobacteriologic methods. Cases occur worldwide, although certain mycobacterial species have strong geographic predilections. Mycobacterium spp. associated with feline leprosy include M. lepraemurium, M. visibile, M. spp. strain Tarwin, and a novel species found in New Zealand and the East Coast of Australia. M. lepraemurium infections have been reported from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Greece, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. Feline leprosy has no zoonotic potential; however, lesions can be clinically and microscopically indistinguishable from lesions caused by tuberculosis bacteria (M. bovis and M. microti) and members of M. avium complex (MAC).",

There are no age, breed, or sex predilections, although most horses are >3 years of age. The skin lesions are characterized by welldemarcated, focal, multifocal, or generalized scaling and crusting, with various degrees of alopecia and increased local skin temperature. Lesions are most common on the lower limbs. Internal nodules may be found in the lung, lymph nodes, liver, gastrointestinal tract, spleen, kidneys, bones, and central nervous system. In some generalized cases, skin lesions may not be present. Histopathology shows multifocal nodular-todiffuse, lymphogranulomatous dermatitis with multinucleated histiocytic giant cells. Vasculitis may be present, particularly in the localized form. The prognosis is poor for the generalized and partially generalized forms, with most horses being euthanized within months of diagnosis. Prognosis for survival is good for the localized form but guarded for the localized skin disease. Spontaneous resolution has been reported in the generalized and localized form. Panniculitis refers to inflammation of the subcutaneous adipose tissue. Panniculitis has many causes, most of which have been discussed in previous sections (bacteria, fungi, immunemediated disease, trauma, injection of irritant substances, foreign bodies, nutritional disorders, adverse reactions to vaccines or other injections, pancreatic disease). The syndrome of sterile nodular panniculitis (SNP) currently is considered to be idiopathic and either primary in origin or associated with a variety of other illnesses, including pancreatic nodular hyperplasia, pancreatic neoplasia, pancreatitis, or immune-mediated disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Concurrent inflammation of the fat in the abdomen, epidural space, and bone (steatitis) can occur in dogs with SNP. It is a rare condition affecting dogs, cats, horses, and cattle. The gross lesions are single to multiple, firm or soft, welldelineated or ill-defined, subcutaneous papules to nodules that may become cystic, ulcerate, or develop draining tracts. The exudate may be oily, serosanguineous, or hemorrhagic. Lesions may be grouped or distributed widely",

The cause is unknown, but studies showing that dog leukocyte antigen class II is significantly associated with SLO support an immune-mediated pathogenesis. A genetic predisposition has been established in certain breeds. The condition occurs in many breeds, but German Shepherds, Rottweilers, and Gordon Setters are predisposed. The condition is painful and often leads to lameness. Amputation of the third phalanx of affected digits to include clawbed epithelium is often needed to establish the diagnosis. Histologic lesions are most pronounced on the dorsal aspect of the claw. The most common changes are a lichenoid interface onychitis with lymphocytic exocytosis and spongiosis and multifocal hydropic degeneration of the basal epidermis. Pigmentary incontinence may be severe, and there may be dermal hemorrhage or fibrosis and mucinosis of the deep dermis. Claws regrow but are misshapen, dry, soft or brittle, and discolored. Secondary bacterial infection may occur. The pathogenesis of SLO is not known and, in fact, the possibility that SLO is not a specific disease entity but merely an inflammatory reaction typical for the clawbed is possible.

NEOPLASTIC AND REACTIVE DISEASES OF THE SKIN Epithelial tumors of the skin Epithelial tumors of the skin are classified according to the predominant pattern of differentiation and the biological behavior. Most of the following tumors are named according to the World Health Organization International Histological Classification of Tumors of Domestic Animals, second series (1998), and Skin Disease of the Dog and Cat: Clinical and Histopathological Diagnosis, 2 nd ed. (2005). The decision to classify a given tumor as one or another of the epidermal or adnexal tumors is often quite arbitrary. A neoplasm of the multipotential germinal cells of the epidermis may differentiate into a number of types of epithelial cells characteristic of mature cells of the various components of the epidermis or adnexa. Sometimes the differentiation results in a distinctive group of tumor cells, making precise identification unequivocal. At other times, the tumor cells may differentiate toward several skin structures forming squamous cells, sebaceous cells, or components of the hair follicle. The tumor can then be named according to the most aggressive or dominant cell type within the tumor. Other than squamous cell carcinomas, the majority of tumors derived from the epidermis or adnexa exhibit benign behavior. \u2022 Tumors of the epidermis include squamous papilloma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell tumors. \u2022 Adnexal tumors of follicular origin include infundibular keratinizing acanthoma (intracutaneous cornifying epithelioma, keratoacanthoma), tricholemmoma, trichofolliculoma, trichoblastoma, trichoepithelioma, and pilomatricoma. \u2022 Adnexal tumors arising from glandular structures include sebaceous gland tumors, epitrichial (apocrine) gland tumors, and atrichial (eccrine) gland tumors.",

The condition was named after a similar human condition thought to be an immune-mediated attack directed against type II collagen and known to affect other cartilaginous sites, such as the nose, trachea, and cardiac valves. The cause is unknown in cats and dogs, in most cases only affects the pinnae, is generally not reported to relapse, and an autoimmune or immune-mediated pathogenesis has not been supported. In one case, cartilaginous lesions were also noted in the costae, larynx, trachea, and limbs, and the cat had multicentric lymphoma. Trauma or damage to the pinnal cartilage has been proposed as a possible initiator. In a few cases, chronic otitis externa has preceded the development of the disease. Clinically, the condition occurs in young to middleaged cats and dogs; one or both pinnae are swollen, erythematous, deformed, and often painful. Histologically, the auricular cartilage may be thinned, curled, or wrinkled, with loss of basophilic staining. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates and variable numbers of neutrophils surround areas of necrosis of the auricular cartilage. Variable amounts of granulation tissue and fibrosis may be seen.Nodular auricular chondropathy has been described rarely in horses. The condition occurs as nonprogressive, single to multiple, unilateral to bilateral, firm, raised, nonmoveable, nonpainful papules and nodules along the pinnal margins and tips.

Intraepithelial cysts filled with mucin may form.There are some species differences in melanocytic tumors. In dogs, melanomas in the oral cavity and nonhaired skin of the lip have been historically cited as \"almost invariably malignant\"; however, newer studies have shown a subpopulation of oral and lip melanocytic neoplasms with a favorable prognosis. Tumors of the nailbeds also are frequently malignant, whereas cutaneous tumors are more commonly benign. In horses, melanomas occasionally occur as congenital tumors; however, they are most common in older gray horses, with a site predilection for the perineum, genital area, and distal limbs ( Fig. 6-155 ). The behavior of melanomas in horses is difficult to predict based on histologic features. They can be clinically malignant and aggressive from the outset, or they may demonstrate slow growth for years with a sudden onset of malignant behavior, or growth can be slow for many years without evidence of metastasis. In some breeds of swine, such as Sinclair miniature swine and Hormel crosses (MeLiM strain, melanoma-bearing Libechov minipigs), melanomas can occur as congenital tumors, and these breeds have been extensively used in biomedical research. Melanomas are uncommon in cats and are often amelanotic. Melanomas in cattle may occur as a congenital lesion, or they may occur at any age. Most are benign in cattle, although occasional tumors are malignant. Melanocytic tumors are uncommon in goats and sheep and are generally pigmented.The histologic diagnosis of melanocytic tumors is complicated by the fact that they can display various degrees of pigmentation, from heavily pigmented to amelanotic. In addition, neoplastic melanocytes can be pleomorphic, and melanocytic tumors can display a variety of cell shapes, including spindle cell, balloon cell (clear cell), epithelioid cell, and signet-ring cell, thus making them difficult to distinguish from poorly differentiated sarcomas and carcinomas. Junctional activity can be helpful in identification , because the only other tumors to display this activity are epitheliotropic lymphoma, and rarely, cutaneous histiocytomas and mast cell tumors. The advances in development of immunohistochemical detection of melanocytic markers has aided greatly in diagnosis of these tumors, particularly in the diagnosis of amelanotic melanomas. Although antibodies against vimentin, S-100, and neuronspecific enolase are sensitive for tumors of melanocytic origin, they are not specific for these tumors and react with many other tumors. For tumor cell specificity and sensitivity, the Carcinoma of the apocrine glands of the anal sac is a rare neoplasm of dogs. These tumors occur as unilateral or bilateral masses ventrolateral to the anus. Paraneoplastic hypercalcemia occurs in 25-90% of cases and is associated with a shorter survival. Metastasis is primarily to regional lymph nodes but is also reported to occur in the lung, spleen, liver, and bone in 50-80% of cases. The tumor varies histologically from solid, rosette, to tubular types. The solid form consists of sheets of relatively monomorphic polygonal cells with scant eosinophilic cytoplasm and round to oval hyperchromatic nuclei. In the rosette form, tumor cells with peripheral nuclei are arranged radially, sometimes surrounding small amounts of eosinophilic secretory material (Fig. 6-154 ). The tubular arrangement has larger cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei. Tubules are filled with eosinophilic secretions. These tumors are invasive and induce a desmoplastic response. Tumor growth is often directed inward through the pelvic canal so that a grossly visible perianal mass is seen in only 50% of cases.",

Classification of these tumors may be difficult, and the nomenclature is inconsistent and controversial. The tumors are classified according to the mature tissue they resemble, but histologic differences are frequently subtle, and morphologic appearance may not be specific enough to reflect histogenesis, particularly for malignant spindle cell tumors. Consequently, accurate diagnosis by morphologic features alone may not be possible for many tumors. An immunohistochemical study of canine cutaneous fibrosarcoma, hemangiopericytoma, and schwannoma found poor correlation between morphologic diagnosis and tumor cell differentiation. Although electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry may be helpful in determining the line of differentiation exhibited by tumor cells, some tumors defy identification because of conflicting results because of loss or alteration in antigens normally present or acquisition of novel antigens. Classification of spindle cell neoplasms is considered important because of the expectation that it will provide a prediction of the biological behavior of the tumor. Exact identification of spindle cell sarcomas of the skin may not be essential, however, because most soft tissue spindle cell tumors exhibit similar behavior and prognosis. The tumors are typically locally invasive, recur frequently after surgical excision, but metastasize infrequently. On gross examination, soft tissue sarcomas can appear well circumscribed or even encapsulated; however, finger-like microextensions of tumor may commonly infiltrate into the surrounding tissue to give rise to satellite lesions that are not visible grossly. The apparent tumor circumscription commonly results in incomplete excision, leaving microscopic foci of tumor tissue that result in recurrence. Wide surgical excision may be curative, however. Because determination of adequacy of excision is prognostic, surgical margins should be marked. The proposed grading system for soft tissue sarcomas is based on the combination of 3 morphologic features: differentiation score (i.e., how well the sarcoma resembles normal tissue (1-3 with the higher number being poorly differentiated), mitotic index (scores 1-3), and tumor necrosis (0-2). A grade of I, II, or III is assigned by the total score of each category (i.e., \u22643 for grade 1; 4-5 for grade II; \u22656 for grade III). The grading system is useful for predicting which neoplasms are likely to recur and metastasize. For any grade, tumors with complete margins are unlikely to recur. Grade III tumors with close surgical margins are likely to recur, whereas grade I tumors infrequently recur, and grade II have an intermediate risk of recurrence. Metastasis is very rare for grade 1 tumors, rare to infrequent for grade II, and grade III tumors have an increased risk. The reader is referred to the Dennis, et al., 2011 reference for more information.The mitotic index is more important than the tumor type in predicting the biologic behavior of most soft tissue sarcomas in dogs.",

In all species, they usually occur in adult and aged animals and are most commonly located on the trunk and proximal limbs. Lipomas are masses of well-differentiated lipocytes indistinguishable from normal fat, except for a compressed boundary of delicate stroma that normally serves to delineate the margin between tumor and adjacent normal adipose tissue. Some lipomas contain cartilage, bone, collagen, or blood vessels. In addition, some mesenchymal tumors contain roughly equal proportions of adipose tissue mixed with other mesenchymal components. These form distinctive variants, such as angiolipomas, fibrolipomas, and leiomyolipomas. Occasionally, hemangiosarcomas and mast cell tumors may be found arising within lipomatous masses, suggesting that lipomas may sometimes provide a local environment suitable for the emergence of these more sinister neoplasms. Necrosis, hemorrhage, fibrosis, and mild macrophage inflammation may occur as a result of trauma to lipomas.Infiltrative lipomas are uncommon tumors of dogs. They are usually large, poorly delineated, deep subcutaneous masses composed of well-differentiated lipocytes that infiltrate subcutaneous muscle and fascia. They may cause pain or interfere with limb function and may invade through the body wall.Liposarcomas are malignant tumors of lipocytes and are uncommon in all species. Liposarcomas in cats have been associated with retrovirus infection and with vaccination sites; a liposarcoma in a dog was associated with a glass foreign body. Liposarcomas may recur but rarely metastasize. They are usually well-circumscribed, nonencapsulated, highly cellular masses of round to polyhedral cells primarily and fewer stellate, spindle, and multinucleated cells. Lipocyte origin is recognized by the presence of cytoplasmic vacuolation that may be numerous fine vacuoles or a single large clear vacuole that displaces the nucleus peripherally. Mitotic figures are generally infrequent. Myxoid liposarcomas have prominent mucinous ground substance. Liposarcomas may be difficult to differentiate from anaplastic sebaceous carcinomas and balloon cell or clear cell melanomas. The tumor cells of liposarcoma are usually arranged in solid sheets of vacuolated cells, whereas in sebaceous carcinoma, the cells tend to be subdivided into nests and lobules. The presence of rare cells with cytoplasmic dusting of very fine brown granules can differentiate melanoma from the other 2 tumors; however, immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin, vimentin, and a melanocytic marker (such as Melan A) may be needed to differentiate the tumors.Tumors originating from muscle are rare in the skin of animals.

Cutaneous lymphomas have been reported in most domestic animals and in many wildlife species; however, the tumor has been most closely studied in the dog, cat, horse, and in cattle. The body of information about cutaneous lymphomas in veterinary dermatopathology has expanded rapidly in recent years, and is still a subject under close study.Cutaneous lymphomas in domestic animals are usually divided into 2 groups: epitheliotropic cutaneous lymphomas, in which the neoplastic lymphocytes invade the epidermis and/ or adnexal epithelium, and nonepitheliotropic lymphomas, which involve the dermis and subcutis.Cutaneous epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) has been reported in the dog, cat, horse, rabbit, and cattle. The misnomer \"mycosis fungoides\" is an accepted synonym in the human and veterinary literature. CTCL must be differentiated from non-epitheliotropic lymphoma (NEL) or dermal lymphoma. CTCL is classically divided into a localized form pagetoid reticulosis (Woringer-Kolopp disease), classic mycosis fungoides, and S\u00e9zary syndrome; however, it is unclear if this classification has any clinical relevance in veterinary medicine. CTCL is a disease of older animals.
