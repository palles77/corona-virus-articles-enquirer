            "text": "Concern that a terrorist group might attack civilian populations or agriculture by releasing deadly pathogens has grown in the past decade. Failed attempts by the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo to release botulinum toxin and anthrax in Tokyo on several occasions in the early 1990s, and the 2001 anthrax letter attacks in the United States seem to confirm these fears. However, there were only five fatalities in the US case and none in the Japanese case. The question naturally arises: How serious is this threat and, if it is serious, what strategy should states take to combat it? This article draws on US experience to outline a strategy for combating bioterrorism that is general enough to apply to most states, especially ones with well developed public health and medical infrastructures.",

            "text": "The Nature of the Threat Historically, attacks using biological agents are rare. This is not surprising given the relative ineffectiveness of biological weapons as a military weapon due to the difficulty of infecting opposing forces, the availability of protective clothing (a simple mask will do in most cases), prompt medical treatment for troops, and the risk that the attacker's troops may also become infected. The centuries-old revulsion to killing people with poison or disease codified in the 1899 Hague Convention, the 1925 Geneva Protocol, and the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) is perhaps the best explanation for why we have not witnessed more deaths due to biological attack. Norms have a powerful, albeit imperfect, influence over human behavior. Finally, with respect to terrorist use, the traditional view has been that ''terrorists want lots of people watching, not lots of people dead.'' To the extent this is true, terrorists have little incentive to attack civilians indiscriminately because they would loose political support within their community and the attack would likely provoke a draconian response by the state to eliminate the group.",

Unlike nuclear weapons, where 5-15 kg of fissile material is required to build a rudimentary fission bomb, no such barrier exists for biological weapons. In fact, biological weapon proliferation is governed more by the spread of knowledge than the spread of material and equipment.

The remnants of the former Soviet biological weapon program, estimated by some accounts to have once employed over 50 000 scientists and technicians, represents an avenue by which states or terrorists might acquire biological weapons without the painstaking research and development required to create them ab initio. President Yeltsin declared in 1992 that the former Soviet biological weapon program had been dismantled and that Biopreparat, the civilian biomedical research organization that conducted much of the biological weapons research, would be converted solely to peaceful pursuits. Due to a lack of transparency, concerns remain that a covert biological weapons program may still exist in Russia. Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria are also believed by the US government to have biological weapon programs, at various levels of development, and South Africa and Iraq formerly had programs from which materials or expertise could leak. In addition, numerous countries have biological weapon defense programs, which produce small quantities of pathogens for peaceful purposes (e.g., testing prophylaxis efficacy), which is allowed under the BTWC, from which knowledge or materials could also leak.",

The fact that biological weapon facilities can be small and have no distinct physical features makes their identification difficult even with intrusive on-site inspections, as the UN Special Commission charged with locating and destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction discovered after the 1991 Iraq War. It took the Commission 4 years to locate most of Iraq's biological weapon facilities and then only after Kamel Hussein divulged the scope of the secret Iraqi program after defecting to Jordan in 1995.

            "text": "It is less clear whether terrorists can acquire effective biological weapons without state support. Terrorists operating rudimentary laboratories face challenges obtaining lethal pathogen strains, extending pathogen shelf life and, in particular, mastering the 'weaponization' hurdles -agent drying, stabilization, and aerosolization (i.e., creating a respirable aerosol of viable agent less than 5 mm in diameter so it does not settle out of the atmosphere close to the release point and so it can penetrate the alveolar region of the lungs where pathogens are most infectious). Wet pathogen slurries are relatively easy to produce but difficult to disseminate in a 5-mm aerosol. Dry powders can be ground to less than 5 mm prior to dispersal (although clumping and electrostatic charge can be a problem), but dry agent is more difficult to produce and handle in a safe manner. Thus, each path has its hurdles. Most terrorists lack the practical knowledge required to circumvent these hurdles, even if they have trained microbiologists in their ranks, unless they receive outside help. (Aum Shinrikyo failed to kill anyone with anthrax because they used a nonlethal vaccine (Stern) strain in 1993 and attempts to aerosolize the spores failed. This led the cult to carry out its more infamous Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995.) Of course, terrorists may not strive for highly efficient weapons. Causing panic, if not terror, is possible even with a rudimentary biological weapon.",

The United States emerged from the Cold War as the world's unrivaled conventional military power, while the collapse of the former Soviet Union left its allies to fend for themselves. Consequently, opponents of the United States must search for 'asymmetric' means -including, possibly, biological weapons -to counter US military might. The suicide bombings in Iraq and Afghanistan are a current example of this approach. Terrorists' incentives to use such weapons may be changing as well. The 11 September 2001 attack in the United States and subsequent indiscriminant attacks in Bali, Madrid, Beslan, and London suggest that terrorists may wish to inflict mass casualties. Biological attacks can also devastate sectors of the US or world economy -an attractive goal to some terrorists. Still, some constraints may exist. For example, terrorists may be reluctant to use contagious agents because the subsequent contagion might spread to their home country or social group, which may have less access to public health. They may also eschew biological attacks because the operation is more likely to fail, preferring conventional explosives instead. To divinely inspired perpetrators, failure can be a deterrent because it suggests that God does not support their actions.",

While modern military forces are relatively invulnerable to biological attack, civilians are quite vulnerable because they do not have protective clothing, would not know when to put it on if they had it, and they do not routinely receive prophylaxis against common biological warfare agents. The agricultural sector in most countries is also vulnerable because farms, animal pens, animal feed, and even finished agricultural products (e.g., milk) typically are not very secure against malevolent actors. The sudden appearance of diseases such as foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalitis, wheat rust, or similar plant or animal diseases can shut down an agricultural sector very quickly, preventing exports if not domestic consumption, as demonstrated by natural outbreaks of these diseases in the past.",

Pathogens may be lethal or nonlethal, contagious or noncontagious, and they may infect the host via contact with openings in the skin, animal or insect vectors, ingestion of contaminated food or water, or inhalation, giving rise to a wide range of delivery mechanisms and attack outcomes that vary by many orders of magnitude in terms of their consequences. The current threat largely involves naturally occurring pathogens and toxins. In many ways, biological attacks are similar to the scourge of disease that has wrought havoc on human, animal, and plant populations for millennia, the main difference being that the consequences are greatly compressed in time if not scope. In the future, genetically altered or synthetic pathogens may be possible because the science of genetic manipulation and DNA synthesis is evolving rapidly.

Diplomatic initiatives may help prevent the spread of proscribed weapons, thereby eliminating the problem at its source. If weapons proliferate, deterrence may dissuade their use. If deterrence is about to fail, preemptive attacks may destroy the weapons before they can launch and, if preemption is not a viable option, 'active' defenses may interdict weapons before they arrive and 'passive' defenses may protect people from their effects after detonation. This framework applies to any proliferation problem -nuclear, biological, chemical, or ballistic missile. All four elements are important, with different emphasis depending on the nature of the proscribed weapon. For example, the Cold War nuclear threat was principally addressed by deterrence, complemented by diplomatic (i.e., arms control) efforts to circumscribe the threat and limited efforts at preemption and defense. For biological weapons, the main emphasis should be on defense, complemented by diplomatic efforts, preemption, and deterrence.",

Even with intrusive inspections, it can be difficult to identify covert facilities. For this reason, the BTWC did not include any monitoring or verification provisions, common to most arms control treaties, because member states could not agree on inspection provisions. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that the BTWC allows states to acquire small quantities of pathogens for prophylactic and other peaceful purposes.

Material protection, accounting, and control would help prevent the spread of pathogens, equipment, and materials; and funding to employ key former Soviet personnel on peaceful biomedical research would discourage them from selling their expertise to foreign bidders.

If an attack with a contagious agent occurs in a foreign country, the sooner this is detected, the better governments will be able to limit its entry into their state by monitoring borders and ports of entry, and restricting travel. Improved international disease surveillance might also detect the presence of covert biological weapon programs in the event of an accident that infects the local population. The 1979 accidental anthrax release in Sverdlovsk, Russia would have been readily detected if such a surveillance system were in place at that time. Of course, hiding covert programs, as well as avoiding political embarrassment from natural disease outbreaks, is precisely why some states will resist disease surveillance that is not under their control. Still, efforts by the World Health Organization (WHO) to implement the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network are well placed and the recently revised WHO International Health Regulations, which require reporting of any disease of international public health concern within 24 hours, when fully implemented, will have public health and security benefits for all nations. These efforts need sustained diplomatic and financial backing. Ultimately governments must recognize that the spread of disease does not respect international boundaries.

Reinforcing this norm is important not because one hopes to convince malevolent actors to abide by the norms to which the status quo powers adhere, but rather for deterrence; it convinces malevolent actors of the sincerity with which the United States and other likeminded states abhor biological weapons and, hence, the resolve with which they will respond if attacked.",

This argument distorts the character of regional leaders.

Similarly, terrorist groups often have clear strategic and tactical goals, with an infrastructure that supports their operations logistically and financially. While those who carry out acts of terror may be suicidal, the top-and mid-level leadership frequently is not.

The reason this approach has not been widely adopted as a defense against bioterrorism is twofold. First, unlike Mother Nature, terrorists are strategic opponents.

The airborne anthrax release upon which this calculation is based is one for which the exposed population is approximately 300 000 people, 8000 of which would become infected in the absence of medical treatment. The medical intervention posited here consists of antibiotic distribution to 95% of the exposed population over a period of 48 hours (possibly followed by vaccination), that antibiotic treatment prior to the onset of symptoms is 98% effective, and that postsymptomatic antibiotic treatment is approximately 50% effective if delivered within 4 days of symptom onset, assuming intensive medical care is available of the sort provided to the victims of the fall 2001 US anthrax letter attacks (i.e., multidrug regimens and pleural fluid drainage). (Different curves are required for different attack sizes and different diseases, and, in the case of contagious diseases, one must account for secondary transmission.) From Figure 1 , one observes that over 90% of this exposed population can be saved if treatment begins within 3 days after exposure. The maximum medical efficacy asymptotes at 93% due to assumptions embedded in the model. Clearly, the sooner one can provide prophylaxis to the exposed population, the better. As the detection and identification time is reduced, more time is available to implement the medical response. And, some functions can overlap in time; for example, the logistics associated with activating the Strategic National Stockpile (warehouses in the United States that currently store medical supplies for a massive infectious outbreak) and setting up and staffing the points of distribution (PODs) where people will eventually queue up to receive treatment can occur simultaneously and immediately after an attack is detected but before the agent has been identified.",

But, Figure 1 does represent the level of protection that, in principle, can be achieved. Moreover, a 90% effective medical response against an attack that hypothetically infects 8000 people, still leaves 800 people infected, which in the case of inhalation anthrax implies close to 800 deaths, a horrific outcome compared to any bioterrorism witnessed to date. This will likely be viewed as an unacceptable outcome. Thus, the tendency will be to strive for medical effectiveness well above 90%. To achieve levels of protection above 90%, it will be very important to implement policies that reduce the percentage of people who do not receive prophylaxis (assumed to be 5% of the exposed population in Figure 1 ) or that do not adhere to the full antibiotic regimen over timeboth of which are important social, as opposed to technical, challenges for a prophylaxis campaign. Finally, it is important to note that this strategy overlaps with efforts to improve public health. Consequently, some of the cost for biodefense will have benefits even if an attack never occurs. Given the low, albeit uncertain, likelihood of a biological attack, emphasizing those biodefense programs and activities that have substantial public health benefits is a prudent way to proceed, although some important biodefense programs will not meet this criterion (e.g., developing an improved smallpox vaccine). Moreover, given that infectious diseases are the leading cause of death in many developing countries, a strategy for coping with bioterrorism that does not address the legitimate public health concerns of the developing world will gain little sympathy, support, or cooperation. Contrariwise, the developed world stands to gain tremendous good will if it helps the governments of developing countries solve their public health problems -a commodity not irrelevant in the global struggle against terrorism.",

The false positive rate depends on the detection technology, the detection threshold (lower thresholds give more false positives), and background biological aerosol levels in the environment that cannot readily be discriminated from the agents one wishes to detect. As a rule, using two or more different detection technologies, with uncorrelated noise and background signals, reduces the false alarm rate considerably.

The world has a lot more to gain from improved public health than it stands to lose from bioterrorism by allowing unfettered access to scientific advances in biology and medicine. Thus, censorship or classification schemes to keep certain information from malevolent actors should be carefully scrutinized, with open access being the norm unless a clear and present danger exists. This is the best hope for having the medical countermeasures available if and when the need arises while at the same time providing benefits to public health. The US government has established the National Advisory Board for Biosecurity, a group of 25 biologists, physicians, and security experts from outside the government, to help maintain the balance between scientific openness and preventing bioterrorism. In addition to developing guidelines for research and publications in the life sciences, they have helped draft a code of conduct for life science professionals and fostered international cooperation to help define these issues.",

An effective decontamination policy must determine safe public exposure levels, which depend on site use and individual susceptibility to infection. Little data exists on environmental background levels for common pathogens. Moreover, the scientific debate regarding the effects of low-level exposure to pathogens may be as contentious as the low-level radiation debate. Therefore, the seemingly simple question of how clean a site must be to ensure public safety will, in fact, be difficult to answer with existing scientific data. Answering this question should be the first priority for decontamination research. Pathogen levels will have to be monitored for months to years after an event, which is both expensive and complicated by the fact that some detection techniques (e.g., DNA sequence matching) do not distinguish living from dead pathogens. In addition, communicating the risks associated with residual contamination to the public in a credible way is vital to allay public anxiety and the economic consequences that flow from these fears. This will be a nontrivial challenge for federal, state, and local authorities working in conjunction with the media.",

Outdoor contamination can be partially removed by washing surfaces with water and, in any case, will decrease with time due to environmental degradation of the agent (e.g., ultraviolet light reduces anthrax spore viability by 10-to 100-fold each day). Locating 'hot spots' will be important but costly because all possible outdoor locations where pathogens might collect in quantity must be sampled initially and monitored thereafter. Outdoor chemical decontamination is expensive and, therefore, will be feasible only for areas on the order of a few square kilometers.",

Indoor remediation can be very expensive, as demonstrated by the experience with the Hart Senate Office Building and the Brentwood Postal Facility after the 2001 US anthrax letter attacks, the latter of which took 1 year at a cost of approximately $130 million to clean up. Moreover, current decontamination chemicals (e.g., chlorine dioxide, methyl-formaldehyde, para-formaldehyde, methyl-bromide, hydrogen peroxide, and household bleach) are corrosive, carcinogenic, and/or toxic. Safer, more effective decontaminants are an important area for research and development, for example, gaseous germination agents that cause anthrax spores to germinate whereupon the vegetative bacillus becomes much more vulnerable to environmental degradation. Combining advanced decontamination agents with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) vacuuming could reduce the indoor decontamination problem to a manageable level, especially when combined with vaccination of the local population. Ultimately, a mixed decontamination strategy that takes advantage of environmental degradation, washing, chemical decontamination, and vacuuming where appropriate should be able to render public areas usable, but the cost may be quite high depending on the extent to which future decontamination technologies can avoid a repeat of the 2001 US anthrax decontamination experience.",

Moreover, this threat is multifaceted and complex, owing to the range of pathogens, delivery modes, and targets for attack. Substantial uncertainties exist in predicting the outcome of any hypothetical biological attack, which implies that attack outcomes can look bleak or relatively benign depending on one's assumptions. The tendency to focus on worst case scenarios, which leads one to the conclusion that biological weapons are the poor man's nuclear weapon, originate, in part, from exaggerations by those trying to move governments to action, which may have the unintended consequence of convincing some that defense against bioterrorism is too hard and others that pathogens are an ideal weapon of terror.

Arms control and export controls may constrain largescale biological weapon programs. More importantly, they reinforce the norm against the acquisition or use of pathogens in war or as weapons of terror. This helps reinforce deterrence, which may be effective against states but is less likely to be effective against terrorist groups. Attribution will be crucial to deter states from aiding terrorist groups. However, neither diplomacy nor deterrence is sufficient alone, or in combination, to reduce the biological weapon threat to a satisfactory level. In terms of limiting damage from such threats, preemption, attractive as the concept might be, will be impractical because it relies on accurate, timely intelligence. Interdiction of covert biological attacks also will be very difficult because one must detect the malevolent actors since one cannot detect the biological weapons themselves. Consequently, the emphasis should be placed on passive defense, which involves detecting the release of pathogens in a timely manner, rapid postattack medical intervention, and effective decontamination to restore contaminated areas to a usable state. In principle, postattack medical response can protect over 90% of an exposed population if pathogens can be detected within 1 day of their release, medical logistics can deliver appropriate medical supplies to the exposed population within 1 day, and a prophylaxis campaign can be mounted to treat the exposed population, potentially numbering into the millions, within 2 days. While no state currently can claim to have such an effective defense in place, except possibly against small outbreaks, such a defense is possible. Moreover, to the extent biodefense overlaps with efforts to improve public health, the expenditures may be justified because resources are not wasted even if a biological attack never occurs.",
