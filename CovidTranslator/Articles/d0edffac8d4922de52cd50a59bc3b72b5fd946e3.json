In most cases, pulmonary injury predominantly affects alveolar type I (ATI) cells. In contrast, the cuboidal, metabolically active alveolar type II (ATII) cells that produce surfactant and other products essential to pulmonary function tend to be spared. Damaged alveolar epithelial cells are replaced via an organized paradigm in which ATII cells appear to function as progenitor cells for ATI cells (1, 2) . Damage to type I cells stimulates type II cells to reenter the cell cycle, differentiate into type I cells, and spread along alveolar septa. This results in coverage of denuded basement membrane and re-establishment of epithelial continuity (1, 3, 4) . In severe inflammation, however, proliferation of ATII cells may become excessive. This can attenuate appropriate replacement of ATI cells in a manner that can lead to fibrosis and scarring (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Novel approaches to therapy might involve modulation of the various phases of epithelial cell repair to reduce fibrosis and restore function in lung injury.",

This inflammatory disorder damages and destroys ATI and, to a lesser degree, ATII cells (3, 12) . In ARDS, cell proliferation may be either beneficial or detrimental. Early in the disease, when loss of pulmonary epithelial cells contributes to pathology, enhancing cell division likely is of value. However, unchecked cell division also enhances coverage of the intra-alveolar exudate by ATII cells and can lead to fibrosis. Furthermore, the overabundance of ATII cells might interfere with differentiation of ATII cells into ATI cells. The rate at which ATII cells proliferate appears to be a key determinant of this balance between repair and fibrosis. Therefore, investigations into the determinants of pulmonary epithelial cell regeneration in ARDS and the factors that modulate the cell cycle are essential.",

            "text": "In eukaryotic organisms, the different phases of the cell cycle are precisely coordinated. During G1, the first phase of the cycle, the cell grows. Once it reaches a certain size, it enters the S phase, during which DNA is replicated. In the next phase (G2), the cell checks that DNA replication is completed and prepares for division. Finally, in the mitosis phase (M), chromosomes separate and the cell divides. After division, most cells exit the cell cycle and enter a resting stage (G0). Some, however, immediately reenter the G1 phase. In G1, diverse metabolic stress and environmental cues are integrated and interpreted to influence the deployment of specific cellular programs that lead to tissue regeneration, differentiation, or death (13) . The key point at which a commitment to division occurs is referred to as the G1 restriction point. Control of progression past the G1 restriction point is determined primarily by the phosphorylation state of the retinoblastoma (Rb) family of proteins (14) (15) (16) . Before the G1 restriction point, hypophosphorylated Rb forms a complex with the E2F1 transcription factor and acts as a transcriptional repressor. Rb polyphosphorylation leads to disassembly of the Rb/E2F1 complex. Active E2F1 can induce the transcription of genes encoding enzymes, such as DNA polymerase, that catalyze DNA replication. Rb polyphosphorylation, in turn, requires the activity of several cyclin-dependent kinases, in particular cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6. Activation of cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 is controlled by their assembly into complexes with members of the cyclin D family. Inflammation is known to effect phosphorylation and the expression of the cyclin D1 family (17) . Therefore, it is logical to evaluate the components of the cell replication apparatus and the factors influencing their activity in ATII cells in experimental ARDS. Modification of these factors might provide important information regarding the pathogenesis of hyperproliferation and fibrosis in ARDS and also might suggest novel therapeutic approaches to this deadly disease (4).",

Of particular importance is the expression of members of the 70kd heat shock protein (Hsp70) family (18) . Previously, in a model of sepsis, cecal ligation and double puncture (2CLP) in rats, we found an inappropriate failure of Hsp70 expression in the lung (19, 20) . Enhancing Hsp70 expression in pneumocytes using an adenoviral vector (AdHSP) expressing Hsp70 decreased histologic abnormalities and improved short-term outcome following 2CLP (21) . Subsequent work has revealed that AdHSP limits inflammation, in part, by attenuation of the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB pathway in pneumocytes (22) . However, this represents only one mechanism by which AdHSP might protect the lungs. Pioneering work by other investigators indicates that cell cycle components, regulatory proteins, and proteins in the mitogenic signal cascade associate with and may be protected by Hsp70 during periods of stress (17, (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) . In ARDS, the characteristic exuberant replication of pulmonary epithelial cells correlates in time with impaired Hsp70 expression (20) . Therefore, it is important to explore AdHSP-mediated changes in pulmonary epithelial cell replication to understand more fully the effects of Hsp70 on the pathophysiology of lung injury. In the present study, we investigate the effects of sepsis-induced experimental ARDS on pulmonary epithelial cell replication 48 hrs after 2CLP. These studies test the hypothesis that administration of AdHSP alters cell regeneration in ARDS.",

A549 cells were incubated for 24 hrs with either medium alone or AdHSP70 (5 \u00d7 10 7 plaqueforming units/mL) and then treated with 20 \u03bcM of MG-132 (Sigma) in F-12 medium for 4 hrs. This was followed by TNF-\u03b1 (20 ng/mL) (R&D) for 20 mins or no treatment. Nuclear extracts were isolated and immunoprecipitated with anti-Rb subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and probed with a monoclonal antibody to Rb. This allows detection of Rb-like proteins that are polyubiquitinated. Molecular weight markers appear to the right of the panel.",

We hypothesize that this process could be altered by the administration of AdHSP. To investigate this postulate, we examined the relative distribution of pulmonary epithelial cell type in lung sections obtained 48 hrs after a septic insult. These sections were stained with antibodies to specific proteins found exclusively in either ATI (Aquaporin 5, AQP5) (33) (34) (35) or ATII ProSP-C cells (4, 29, 36, 37) . Studies of sections from untreated (T0) animals revealed AQP-positive cells lining the alveoli (Fig. 1, left) . Immunostaining with an antibody to ProSP-C at the baseline demonstrated up to three positively stained cells per alveolus (Fig. 2, left) . Sepsis-induced ARDS changed the distribution and number of both types of cells. Animals subjected to 2CLP and treated with PBS (2CLPPBS) had diminished AQP in affected lung regions (Fig. 1, center) , indicating a loss of ATI cells (Fig. 1, graph) . In the same rats, there was a dramatic increase in the abundance of ProSP-C-positive cells, presumably in ATII cells (Fig. 2, center) . In contrast, treatment with AdHSP (2CLPHSP) revealed a pattern similar to that seen in T0 animals. That is, staining for AQP was prominent (Fig. 1, right) , whereas no more than three cells per alveolus appeared to contain ProSP-C (Fig. 2, left and graph) . Overall, these findings demonstrated a CLP-induced loss of ATI cells and proliferation of ATII 48 hrs following the initial septic insult. AdHSP treatment reversed or limited this change. To assure that expression of Hsp70 and not the adenoviral vector itself caused the observed changes, we investigated the effects of treatment with AdGFP. This was associated with only nine ProSP-C-positive cells/alveolus (Fig. 2) .",

Others have shown that heat shock modulates the cell cycle (22, 26, 27) . Therefore, we examined the effects of AdHSP-enhanced expression of Hsp70 on different aspects of cell replication in sepsis-induced ARDS. To initiate this investigation, we examined two markers of cell proliferation. The first, BrdU, incorporates into replicating DNA. The second, PCNA, is an essential regulatory factor for DNA replication and DNA repair. When compared with T0, we found increased BrdU incorporation into ATII cells in PBS-treated septic animals (Table 1 ; Fig. 3A and graph) . Similarly, PBS-treated septic rats had increased PCNA staining relative to T0 (Table 1 ; Fig. 4A and right) . BrdU and PCNA-positive ATII cells were cuboidal and characterized by relatively abundant cytoplasm and large nuclei (Figs. 3A and 4A). Septic animals given the control vector AdGFP developed changes in PCNA expression similar to those observed in animals given PBS (Table 1; Fig. 4A ). This implies that the adenoviral vector itself does not contribute to these changes. The findings in PBS-and AdGFP-treated animals contrasted sharply with those observed in AdHSP-treated rats. In septic animals treated with AdHSP, we found decreased BrdU and PCNA staining relative to septic animals receiving PBS or AdGFP (Table 1; Figs. 3 A and 4A ). In fact, data were similar to values observed in untreated (T0) rats (Table 1) .",

Increased expression of this enzyme will occur once the cell has passed the G1 restriction point and entered the S phase (39, 40) . Therefore, we examined the effects of sepsis-induced ARDS on the expression of DNA polymerase-\u03b2.

This nuclear phosphoprotein binds to E2F1 and limits its ability to activate E2F1-dependent promoters. In contrast to the unphosphorylated or hypophosphorylated forms of Rb, which predominate during G1, polyphosphorylated Rb has a low affinity for E2F1 (40, 41) . In vitro studies suggest that heat shock stabilizes unphosphorylated Rb (40, 41) . Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the sepsis-induced decrease in E2F1 binding activity reflected increased Rb phosphorylation and that AdHSP attenuated Rb phosphorylation. Using nuclear proteins isolated from control animals (T0), septic animals treated with PBS, septic animals treated with AdGFP, or septic animals treated with AdHSP, we examined Rb (Fig. 5B) . These studies revealed that the intranuclear abundance of Rb protein in septic animals receiving PBS or AdGFP was significantly lower than in the T0 controls and than in AdHSP-treated septic animals ( Fig. 5B and upper panel) . The abundance of nuclear pRb was significantly higher than control in septic animals treated with PBS but not in those treated with AdHSP ( Fig. 5B  and lower panel) . These data indicate that sepsis induced phosphorylation of Rb. To determine whether the prevention of Rb phosphorylation might result, in part, from an interaction with Hsp70, we immunoprecipitated nuclear protein extracts with an antibody to Rb and performed immunoblotting with an antibody to Hsp70 (Fig. 5C and upper panel) . Our data confirmed that Hsp70 associates with the Rb complex in septic animals treated with AdHSP and that no Hsp70-Rb association occurred in septic animals receiving either PBS or AdGFP (Fig. 5C and upper  panel) . Additionally, immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Rb followed by immunoblotting to E2F1 (Fig. 5C and lower panel) demonstrated an interaction between E2F1 and Rb in AdHSP-treated septic animals. Thus, AdHSP treatment preserved the E2F1/Rb complex. Controls for the specificity of immunoprecipitation demonstrated that this interaction is specific for Hsp70, Rb, and E2F1 and does not represent a non-specific antibody antigen reaction (data not shown).",

In this paradigm, ATII cells replicate, migrate across the denuded alveolar basement membrane, and then differentiate into ATI cells. Furthermore, it has been postulated that this process becomes dysfunctional in ARDS. In this syndrome, ATII cells migrate not across a denuded basement membrane but rather cover a collection of cellular debris. This stimulates ongoing ATII or pleuripotential cell proliferation and limits differentiation of these precursors into ATI cells. The studies presented here were designed to test aspects of this hypothesis in sepsis-induced ARDS. We first demonstrated that this model stimulates both a loss of ATI cells and excessive proliferation of ATII cells. We then reversed this pathology by treatment with AdHSP. Our data indicate that the ability of Hsp70 to attenuate sepsis-induced replication of ATII cells results, at least in part, from an effect on the G1 restriction point. Specifically, we showed that Hsp70 treatment attenuates the activity of E2F1, a key cell division transcription factor that is inactive when complexed to the regulatory retinoblastoma protein. Our findings reveal that Hsp70 interferes with phosphorylation of Rb, preventing its degradation by the proteasome and, thus, limiting E2F1 activation. The expression of one of the principal target genes for E2F1, DNA polymerase-\u03b2, was increased by 2CLP and attenuated by treatment with AdHSP. These data may have important mechanistic and therapeutic implications.",

This study explored one of a number of potential mechanisms by which this protection might be conferred. In this report, we examine another way in which AdHSP might limit lung injury. Specifically, we present two key findings. First, we have confirmed, by staining for BrdU and PCNA, that the loss of ATI cells in lung injury is associated with extensive proliferation of ATII cells. To demonstrate, we stained sections with an antibody to ProSP-C, a protein specific and characteristic for this cell type. This is essential because 2CLP is associated with a massive infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lung. While the majority of these migrating cells are neutrophils, there is also an increase in macrophages. These latter can be difficult to distinguish from ATII cells. However, ProSP-C, the precursor of surfactant protein-C, is uniquely expressed in ATII cells (2, 45) . To identify the lost cells, we stained sections with AQP, an apical transmembrane protein found in ATI cells (46) . This demonstrates a decrease in the number of these cells per microscopic field. While we attribute the decrease in AQP abundance observed in septic animals, receiving either PBS or AdGFP, to this loss of ATI cells, there are alternative explanations. Inflammation down-regulates the expression of the AQP5 receptor (47) , and thus, the expression per cell may be decreased. Alternatively, inflammatory cell infiltration makes it difficult to distinguish alveoli histologically. This may result in fewer alveoli per field. Thus, while the number of ATI cells per field may be decreased, the number per alveolus may be unchanged. Careful examination of Figure 1B clearly demonstrated that the number of ATI cells per high-powered field is reduced after 2CLP but preserved when septic rats were administered intratracheal AdHSP. The use of ProSP-C and AQP5 to study the distribution of ATI and ATII cells various models of acute inflammation is a well-validated approach (1, 12, 44) .",

            "text": "Further mechanistic information is provided by examination of the abundance of pRb following 2CLP. We observed that AdHSP attenuated the sepsisinduced hyperphosphorylation of pRb. This allowed for the stabilization of the Rb/E2F1 complex. In other pathways, Hsp70 prevents or limits protein phosphorylation of a number of key intracellular regulatory proteins, such as heat shock factor-1 and I\u03baB\u03b1 (42, 43) . This suggests that one mechanism by which Hsp70 may limit pathologic changes is via the modulation of phosphorylation. However, our previous study on the NF-kB pathway suggests that this is an incomplete explanation (22) . The effects of Hsp70 on this inflammatory pathway appears to involve the stabilization of multi-component protein complexes, such as Rb/E2F1. Indeed, this is consistent with the activity of Hsp70 in some, but not all, pathways. Morimoto (23) has proposed that the specific effects of chaperones are determined by the associated co-factors and not the activity of the protein itself. Therefore, Hsp70 may inhibit certain processes and facilitate others. This is consistent with the different effects on the ATI and ATII cells reported here. Additional studies will investigate the contributions of potential co-factors to these processes.",

This effect on proliferation may have longterm beneficial or detrimental effects. ARDS is an inflammatory syndrome that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality (50) . In part, these finding at the 48-hr time point may represent the early changes that later on culminate in the development of pulmonary fibrosis (9) . Therefore, interventions that attenuate ATII proliferation may limit this process and reduce fibrosis. Additional studies will be required to examine the effects of Hsp70 on fibrosis in ARDS. In addition, ongoing investigations will help confirm the value of pharmacologic, genetic, or mechanical induction of Hsp70 expression in this highly lethal disease.
