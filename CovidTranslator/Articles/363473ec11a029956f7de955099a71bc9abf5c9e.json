Young children, immunocompromised people, and pre-weaning animals are especially vulnerable, but treatment options are limited and there is no vaccine. A laboratory diagnosis is required to confirm cases of cryptosporidiosis, and species and genotype determination is essential in distinguishing human from non-human sources, understanding transmission, and strengthening the epidemiological evidence for causative links in outbreaks. However, testing is not consistent, as demonstrated by investigation of a significant increase in cases in some European countries during 2012. Many methods employed are laborious and time-consuming; recent advances, translated into diagnostic assays, can improve testing and facilitate typing to support clinical and environmental investigations.",

Cryptosporidium causes sporadic cases and outbreaks of gastroenteritis (cryptosporidiosis) through faeces-contaminated drinking and recreational water [1] , food and beverages [2] , person-to-person spread in households and institutions such as daycare settings [3] , farmed animal contact [4] , and in livestock, companion, and other animals [5] (Figure 1 ). Increased morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic implications [6, 7] are recognised by inclusion of Cryptosporidium in the Neglected Diseases Initiative of the World Health Organization (WHO) [8] . Cryptosporidiosis is a laboratory diagnosis because it is not pathognomonic -in other words, the acute signs and symptoms can be similar to other infectious and non-infectious causes of gastroenteritis [9, 10] . In cases where other parasites are also suspected, or in populations where they are prevalent, multiple faecal samples with and without chemical preservation may be required [11] (Figure 2 ). Differential diagnosis enables provision of appropriate advice on treatment, control, and management, and at the population level it is required for the identification of outbreaks and for monitoring trends, risk factors, and interventions.",

This report highlights difficulties in comparing data across countries, derived differently due to variations in laboratory testing and reporting. The lack of widespread, routine Cryptosporidium diagnosis and species identification, or a standardised subtyping scheme, impinges on investigation. These shortcomings also occur in water testing where only the genus is identified.

            "text": "Cryptosporidium, an uncertain taxonomy Taxonomic positions are important in understanding the evolution, biology, pathogenesis, sources, and transmission of pathogens as well as focussing efforts for identifying targets for diagnosis and drug therapies. The taxonomy of Cryptosporidium (phylum Apicomplexa, class Coccidea, order Eimeriidae) was disputed, because of life-cycle ( Figure 1) , phylogenetic, and biological differences observed in comparison with other Eimeriidae (e.g., Cyclospora, Cystoisospora, and Eimeria) [19] . Traditionally, Apicomplexan species were defined by host-specificity, location of endogenous stages, and morphology. For Cryptosporidium spp., however, host-specificity is variable, and oocyst morphology distinguishes only those with smaller, near-spherical oocysts (4-6 mm in diameter) from those with larger, more oval oocysts (7 \u00c2 5 mm) ( Table 1) . Therefore, a combination of biological and genetic data is recommended for identifying and naming new species: (i) morphological features of the oocyst and demonstration of developmental stages; (ii) natural and experimental host range; (iii) detailed biological characterisation, including localisation and pathology associated with an individual host; (iv) differential diagnosis; (v) genetic characterisation at multiple loci, to include the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) and other functional genes; (vi) deposition of definitive reference sequences and preserved material for further analyses; and (vii) compliance with International Committee for Zoonotic Nomenclature (ICZN) species-naming rules [20] . Where mainly genetic data are available, isolates are described as 'genotypes' [21] . The ICZN rules are open to interpretation, especially in the Principle of Priority, leading to conflicting opinions about renaming Cryptosporidium spp. (e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum as Cryptosporidium pestis) [22] . To avoid confusion and promote stability, here we use C. parvum for the species infective to calves and humans [21] .",

Schematic representation of the Cryptosporidium life-cycle and transmission emphasising elements exploited in diagnosis and detection. A population of sporulated oocysts is ingested by a host, and undergo excystation in the intestinal lumen. Four sporozoites are present in each oocyst, and emerge (A) to invade the microvilli at the brush border of the mucosal epithelium (B) and develop into trophozoites (not shown). Trophozoites undergo asexual division (merogony) to form eight merozoites within type I meronts (C), and release invasive merozoites (D) that invade adjacent host cells to form additional type I meronts or to form type II meronts (E). Merozoites released from type II meronts do not recycle but invade host cells to initiate the sexual stage. Microgametocytes released from microgamonts (F) fertilise the macrogamonts (G) to become zygotes. Most of the zygotes develop into oocysts with a thick, two-layered wall (H) but a minority only have a unit membrane surrounding the four sporozoites (I) and facilitate the autoinfective cycle that maintains infection without further ingestion of thick-walled oocysts. Sporulated, thick-walled oocysts containing four sporozoites (J) are released in faeces and transmit infection between hosts. Abbreviation: TRAPs, thrombospondin related adhesive proteins.",

The incubation period (normal range 3-12 days, usually 5-7 days) is dose-dependent. Cryptosporidiosis is self-limiting in immunocompetent people, and the symptoms vary in severity (mild to severe); duration can be for up to 1 month during which time relapse occurs in about one third of cases. Severity varies partially with the general health of the patient, and those experiencing mild, self-limiting diarrhoea will be unlikely to seek medical attention and obtain a diagnosis ( Table 2 ).",

The parasite is widely endemic and is one of the most frequently diagnosed causes of diarrhoea in preweaning calves [25] . Multiple pathogens can be involved in neonatal diarrhoea (rotavirus, coronavirus, pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp.), and cryptosporidiosis is confirmed by finding significant numbers of oocysts in diarrhoeic faeces in their absence [25] . However, coinfection may modulate the clinical presentation, and has been widely speculated to lead to more severe cryptosporidiosis [5] , although experimental data to support this are still lacking. Infection with C. felis is often asymptomatic in cats but those also infected with the feline leukaemia virus are more likely to exhibit clinical signs [5] . A very different clinical spectrum may also be seen for example in birds where C. baileyi and C. meleagridis can also cause respiratory disease, requiring investigation of different sample types ( Table 2 ). . Workflow for Cryptosporidium diagnosis during investigation of gastroenteritis. Unbroken boxes represent adopted tests [11] (see: http://www.oie.int/ international-standard-setting/terrestrial-manual/access-online/); broken lines and boxes represent reference or specialist tests; broken, grey lines and box represents alternative workflow based on multi-pathogen diagnostic PCRs. The optimisation of automated nucleic acid extraction processes and application of multiplex, real-time PCR offers great potential for streamlining diagnostic workflows.",

For example, C. hominis, but not C. parvum, was associated with joint pain, eye pain, headaches, and fatigue during the 2 months following human infection [26] . Although a study of intestinal mucosal biopsies and serology from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) did not support a major role for Cryptosporidium in its pathogenesis [27] , infection can trigger IBD flare, and inclusion of a test for Cryptosporidium is indicated in IBD patients seeking medical intervention for sudden exacerbation of digestive symptoms [28] . Experimental infection of rats with C. parvum triggers long-term pathological changes in the small intestine similar to those found in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [29] , supporting anecdotal reports of association. If a postinfectious (PI) association is found with Cryptosporidium for IBS (PI-IBS), reassurance could be provided to diagnosed patients that their altered bowel habit is consistent with PI-IBS and is likely to resolve without need for medical Major host(s) Association with human cryptosporidiosis [18] Association with animal cryptosporidiosis [5, 21, 23] Additional From the original papers describing the species or genotype. c See [18] for an explanation of gp60 subtyping and nomenclature. d Currently, Cryptosporidium is the only genus in the Family Cryptosporidiidae, but piscine species show considerable genetic distance, ultrastructural and developmental differences in comparison with other Cryptosporidium species, and a new genus, Piscicryptosporidium, has been proposed, pending study of additional piscine isolates [81] .",

One approach to overcoming this has been the commercial development of a PCR-EIA that identifies Cryptosporidium spp., C. hominis and C. parvum [45] . However, molecular diagnostic assays are being implemented in diagnostic laboratories, especially in virology and some aspects of bacteriology, and are emerging for enteric protozoa. Real-time PCR probe-based assays for the detection of multiple protozoa have been described, such as for Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Dientamoeba fragilis, with a testing algorithm for microscopy based on clinical information, which could be adapted to specific settings depending on the likelihood of involvement of other parasites [46] . The replacement of probes with carboxylated Luminex microspheres provides an alternative detection system, as demonstrated for several parasites [47] . An assay based on multiplex-tandem PCR (MT-PCR) describes the simultaneous detection of bacterial pathogens in Cryptosporidium-positive stools, and the authors suggest that the increased amplification efficiency would also be useful for water samples [48] . Commercial multiplex PCR-based assays for comprehensive panels of gastrointestinal pathogens are becoming available, utilising robotic platforms for DNA extraction and assay set-up. Although offering streamlined and high testing capacity, investigation of a wide range of pathogens in all samples increases the number of positive findings; this may not always be warranted clinically but may shed light on the importance of infection in patients previously not investigated, and of coinfections. Pathogen panels should ideally be tailored for the population under investigation. Downstream testing of extracted DNA for further species/genotype discrimination of Cryptosporidium-positive samples either in the same, or more likely a reference, laboratory could be readily implemented for epidemiological and outbreak investigations (Figure 2) .",

In the USA, classification of waterborne outbreaks according to the strength of epidemiological, clinical, and environmental data now reflects the increasing use of molecular characterization of pathogens both in clinical and environmental samples [49] . However, outbreak investigations focus on specific incidents, and the contamination event will usually have passed some time before recognition of an outbreak. For understanding Cryptosporidium spp. transmission, baseline data need to be generated by well-structured sample surveys. Interventions such as those implemented to reduce waterborne disease need to be monitored for effectiveness, and one strategy is to compare population exposure. Various Box 1. Attributes of current Cryptosporidium faecal diagnostic assays Selection criteria include resources (staff time, expertise, grade, finances, specialist equipment), desired turnaround time, the population being tested, desired sensitivity and specificity, and the need to identify other pathogens. Preservatives can inhibit PCR and must be removed by washing; this may not be possible if the preservative has penetrated the oocysts. Faeces can be concentrated by sedimentation using modified formol-ethyl acetate or solvent-free techniques, but significantly fewer parasites and larger deposits have been reported in a solventfree system, and low-density parasites might be missed [86] . Conventional flotation (e.g., zinc sulphate, saturated sodium chloride or sucrose) results in cleaner preparations but low-density oocysts may be missed. Using fluorescent stains (e.g., Auramine O) oocyst observation is easier and less subjective, and slides can be scanned at lower magnification than acid-fast stained slides, but a fluorescence microscope is needed. IFM is less subjective than other microscopy stains and increases sensitivity and specificity, although some notable crossreactions (e.g., algae) may occur in food, water, and environmental testing, necessitating observation of confirmatory features: internal contents and sporozoites by differential interference contrast and sporozoite nuclei by staining with a nuclear fluorogen. EIAs can be automated and are more sensitive than acid-fast microscopy. Immunochromatographic lateral flow (ICLF) is less sensitive, but requires little skill and can be performed anywhere as a rapid test, for example pen-side. ICLF and EIA kits may include other pathogenic protozoa in a single test (e.g., Giardia [87] ), and additionally for humans, Entamoeba histolytica [88] .",

Molecular assays are underpinned by efficient DNA extraction but oocysts may be present at low density in complex matrices (faeces, slurry, food, water) that may contain PCR inhibitors. Oocysts in faeces or semi-purified suspensions need first to be disrupted by procedures such as bead beating, freeze-thaw, cycles or enzymatic digestion [91] . Automated DNA extraction procedures can be used [48] . PCR conditions must include mitigation of potentially inhibitory substances (e.g., heme, bilirubin, bile salts, or complex carbohydrates). PCR primers and conditions need to be selected carefully to amplify all Cryptosporidium species of interest and to avoid nonspecific amplification. There is no gold-standard diagnostic test. For comparison of sensitivity and specificity, either one must be nominated or comparison tests such as McNemar's or a Bayesian model must be applied [90] . The outcome depends not only on the test properties but also the nature of the samples (e.g., consistency, parasite density), the statistical power of the study, and skill in performing assays.

Alternative methods such as continuous-flow centrifugation have been shown to provide at least equivalent recovery efficiencies [51] . A similar sequence of oocyst recovery and detection from surface eluates of fresh food produce [2, 17] forms the basis of a method currently being considered as an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard.

            "text": "Standard methods provide no information about the species, virulence, or viability of oocysts; Cryptosporidium spp. need to be identified in water monitoring otherwise all oocysts detected must be assumed to present a public health risk. Sequencing DNA from nested PCR of the SSU rRNA gene, using a repetitive and limiting PCR template approach to improve analytical sensitivity and differentiation of multiple species or genotypes in a single sample, provides the benchmark [54] . However, this is technically demanding, and is outwith the scope of most water-testing laboratories. A simplified approach is being validated using single-round, conventional, or real-time PCR of the SSU rRNA and hsp70 genes to differentiate the main human pathogens C. hominis, C. parvum, and C. meleagridis from other species commonly found in the environment (http://waterrf.org/Pages/Projects.aspx?-PID=4099). A non-PCR-based method is loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), based on autocycling strand-displacement DNA synthesis by Bst polymerase, and this may overcome the inhibitory potential of some samples and has been reported to detect organisms at relatively low concentrations in water samples [55] , although it has not yet been subjected to independent evaluation. Impact of genomics on detection, diagnosis, and typing Molecular biology had a vast impact on the understanding of the species concept within the genus Cryptosporidium, resulting in a dramatic increase in species numbers and genotypes [21] . As a result, there is a need to understand the level of within-species genetic variation such that selected DNA sequences can be indentified as references. This is particularly important because a single locus (the SSU rRNA gene) is often used as species marker; confidence in species determination and subtyping is greatly increased by using multiple markers that are spread throughout the genome [56] . Phylogenetic analysis has proven to be an essential tool for determining species status; this approach provides more information than is achieved through individual sequence comparisons (such as BLAST searches) because more weight is given to informative mutations that may be species-or group-specific [20, 54] . Use of reference sequences will help to reduce the confusion caused by sequences deposited in databases that may have been falsely attributed to a species due to limited understanding of species complexity at the time of submission. This is a considerable problem for a genus in which species numbers are still increasing.",

The relatively small Cryptosporidium genome (9.1-9.2 Mb) combined with ever-reducing sequencing costs will allow more Cryptosporidium genomes to be sequenced, and from different species and from multiple isolates of the same species [57] . Publication of new genomes will allow detailed comparisons, resulting in identification of more species-specific markers, polymorphic mini-and micro-satellite markers, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [58] . These markers can be exploited to develop improved PCR-based diagnostics utilising the more informative parts of the Cryptosporidium genome [16] . The SNPs may also be used in attempts to identify virulence genes or factors involved in host-specificity [58] . The increasing amount of genomic data will undoubtedly lead to further development of microarrays for detecting variation within parasite populations. However, this is a longer-term development and currently there is much focus on the use of mini-and micro-satellite markers. Generally, these are very variable because they are commonly in noncoding regions of the genome and are subject to fewer functional restraints that impede the accumulation of mutations. However, many Cryptosporidium satellite markers were identified before genome sequences became available, and are mostly within coding regions [59] . These satellite markers have been used successfully for studying Cryptosporidium population dynamics to evaluate transmission routes and zoonotic potential [59] [60] [61] [62] . There is a need not only for the further development of subtyping methods for epidemiological purposes, but also for their standardisation. A recent review revealed that 55 markers have been used in various combinations on different platforms to investigate variation within C. parvum and C. hominis [59] . Although multi-locus typing is a potentially powerful Review Trends in Parasitology May 2013, Vol. 29, No. 5 tool, global meta-analysis and comparisons are impossible if different methods are used, and there is a need for standardisation. Assessment of existing markers and suggestions for taking these forward in independent validation studies for harmonisation of typing schemes have been published recently by Robinson and Chalmers [59] . Typing tools developed based on Cryptosporidium genome analyses, if harmonised, will also have the potential to help with outbreak investigations, source attribution, investigations into the fate and transport of oocysts, persistence within hosts, studies into the role of strain-specific immunity, and the identification of virulence factors and genes involved in host specificity.",
