Mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with lower respiratory tract RSV infection can exceed 80%. It has been shown that RSV replication in immunosuppressed individuals is significantly prolonged, but the contribution of pulmonary damage, if any, to the pathogenesis of RSV disease in this susceptible population is not known. In this work, we tested RI-002, a novel standardized Ig formulation containing a high level of RSV-neutralizing Ab, for its ability to control RSV infection in immunocompromised cotton rats Sigmodon hispidus. Animals immunosuppressed by repeat cyclophosphamide injections were infected with RSV and treated with RI-002. Prolonged RSV replication, characteristic of immunosuppressed cotton rats, was inhibited by RI-002 administration. Ab treatment reduced detection of systemic dissemination of viral RNA. Importantly, pulmonary interstitial inflammation and epithelial hyperplasia that were significantly elevated in immunosuppressed animals were reduced by RI-002 administration. These results indicate the potential of RI-002 to improve outcome of RSV infection in immunocompromised subjects not only by controlling viral replication, but also by reducing damage to lung parenchyma and epithelial airway lining, but further studies are needed.",

            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in high-risk infants and children, elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Among hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (HSCT), RSV affects between 2 and 17% of patients, [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] with infection progressing to lower respiratory tract infection in 17-84% of cases. 1, [6] [7] [8] [9] The mortality rate of RSV lower respiratory tract infection in HSCT patients, if left untreated, can reach 83% or higher. [10] [11] [12] [13] Studies in patients with hematologic disorders and in recipients of HSCT show that they maintain dramatically prolonged RSV replication, with a reported median duration of 30.5 days. 14 Early intervention with ribavirin (aerosolized or oral) can reduce mortality associated with RSV infection of patients with hematologic malignancies and transplant recipients, highlighting the importance of controlling viral replication in this cohort. However, a significantly higher dose of ribavirin is required to achieve the therapeutic effect. 14, 15 Efficacy of ribavirin therapy may be improved by combining it with the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or intravenous RSV immunoglobulin (RSV-IVIG, a preparation containing 5-10 times the amount of RSV-neutralizing Ab found in standard IVIG preparations). 16, 17 RSV-IVIG RespiGam approved for prophylaxis of RSV infection is no longer manufactured (http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/ 300_399/0318.html) and the humanized monoclonal Ab palivizumab is the only currently available drug for the prevention of RSV in high-risk infants and children. 18 Palivizumab use in adult patients is restricted due to cost considerations; nevertheless, it has been tested in HSCT patients as a part of the combined therapy with ribavirin. The treatment was found to be safe and well-tolerated, however, its efficacy was not conclusive. 8, 19 In the normal immunocompetent subject, antivirals administered after RSV infection reduce viral replication but do not ameliorate the disease. [20] [21] [22] In contrast, antivirals given before infection reduce both viral replication and disease, suggesting that once triggered, the inflammatory response leads to cytokine response and subsequent pulmonary pathology that remains even after the viral load is decreased. 23 As cellular infiltration of the lung is a large component of RSV-induced pulmonary damage, it has been shown using an animal model that a combination of antiviral (for example, palivizumab) and anti-inflammatory (for example, corticosteroids) treatment may represent an effective therapeutic regime. [22] [23] [24] However, whether the same approach would be required for immunosuppressed individuals is not known. Pulmonary pathology in HSCT patients with RSV infection may be mediated by the lung damage caused by prolonged viral replication. In this case, treatment with a drug that has strong antiviral activity may have a higher therapeutic efficacy in immunosuppressed patients compared with immunocompetent individuals infected with RSV because of the reduction in pulmonary damage caused by excessive viral replication.",

Immunosuppression and RSV infection were also associated with significant hyperplasia of the mucosal epithelium of the conducting airways, which was absent in non-immunosuppressed, RSV-infected animals (Figures 4a and b , compare top and bottom panels). Immunosuppressed, RSV-infected animals treated with a high-dose antiviral regime had little to no inflammation in the parenchyma and a significantly reduced epithelial hyperplasia (Figure 4b , compare top and middle panels), whereas intermediate-dose treatment was slightly less effective at reducing epithelial damage. These results suggest that the high-dose antiviral regimen reduces both pneumonia and airway epithelial hyperplasia in immunosuppressed animals infected with RSV.

Repeat administration of RI-002 was used to achieve the desired effect, based on the earlier observation that an insufficient number of treatments can lead to rebound RSV replication in immunosuppressed animals undergoing Ab therapy. 36 A regime consisting of three administrations of 1500 mg/kg RI-002 was largely comparable in antiviral efficacy to a combination treatment that included one dose of 1500 mg/kg followed by two doses of 750 mg/kg. However, the high-dose treatment of repeat 1500 mg/ kg RI-002 doses appeared to be more effective in restoring the pulmonary histology to the level similar to that seen in normal cotton rats infected with RSV. In normal cotton rats, a single administration of 750 or 1000 mg/kg RI-002 given prophylactically inhibited RSV replication in the lower respiratory tract, reducing viral titers to undetectable level. Stronger antiviral effects of RI-002 correlated with higher serum RSV-neutralizing Ab titers achieved one day after Ab inoculation, consistent with the previously established correlation between serum RSV-neutralizing Ab titers and RSV load. 26 RI-002 infusion ameliorated pulmonary pathology associated with prolonged RSV replication in immunosuppressed cotton rats. Both elevated interstitial pneumonia and epithelial hyperplasia, features characteristic of immunosuppressed RSV-infected animals, were strongly reduced by RI-002. Antiviral therapy, therefore, appears more effective as a stand-alone treatment against pulmonary disease in immunosuppressed compared with normal cotton rats infected with RSV. 22, 23 This suggests that excessive viral replication may indeed be a driving factor of RSV pathogenesis in immunosuppressed subjects and that RSV antivirals may have a higher therapeutic potential as a stand-alone treatment in immunosuppressed patients, but future studies in the human patient population are needed to confirm this hypothesis. In addition to antiviral activity, an anti-inflammatory activity, which is present in IVIG, 37-39 could be beneficial and could have contributed to the disease-ameliorating effect seen in this work. Dissemination of microbial pathogens outside of primary target organs is also a significant problem for bone marrow transplant recipients. 40 Dissemination of RSV in immunocompromised patients is not well documented, but RSV RNA has been detected in the blood and found to correlate with poor outcome of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in HSCT recipients. 41, 42 Our results show that detection of RSV RNA outside of respiratory tract of immunosuppressed cotton rats was reduced by RI-002 treatment.",

            "text": "There is a well-defined segment of patients with immune deficiency diseases that require regular infusions of Ig to reconstitute their deficient humoral Ab compartment and who are also extremely susceptible to RSV disease. [43] [44] [45] With the withdrawal of RespiGam from the market, an important IVIG product in the arsenal for controlling RSV disease in vulnerable populations is no longer available. The improved efficacy of IVIG vs palivizumab against RSV in HSCT patients 17, 19 suggested that broader spectrum Ab may be required. A pivotal phase III RI-002 clinical trial in patients with immune deficiency disease has recently been completed. 46 The favorable secondary outcomes that were achieved suggest that the unique Ab profile of RI-002 may have contributed to the positive results. RI-002 not only has higher titer Ab to RSV, but also contains significantly higher titers of Ab to other respiratory viruses including coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus and influenza virus (manuscript submitted for publication). Multiple respiratory viruses, including adenoviruses, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses have higher infection rates in HSCT recipients and may have prolonged viral replication in these subjects. Lower respiratory tract infection complication rates are high for RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, adenoviruses and human metapneumovirus (reviewed in Shah et al. 47 ), suggesting that the polyvalent and broad antiviral characteristics of IVIG may be important in this patient population. Figure 6 . Effect of RI-002 prophylaxis on RSV replication in immunosuppressed cotton rats. Cotton rats were immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide and inoculated with RI-002 at 750 (low dose) or 1500 mg/kg (high dose). Twenty-four hours later, animals were infected with 10 5 PFU of RSV A/Long per animal. On days 4 and 8 post infection, RI-002 treatment was repeated in the same dose as the original one. Groups of animals were killed on days 4 and 10 post infection and lungs were collected for viral titration (VT). Control animals were immunosuppressed, infected with RSV and inoculated with saline one day before and on days 4 and 8 post infection. Results represent the mean \u00b1 s.e. for 4-5 animals per group. *Po0.05 when compared with RSV-infected animals treated with saline killed on the same day.",

On day 21, animals were infected with 10 5 PFU of RSV A/Long per animal. On days 1, 4 and 7 post infection, RI-002 treatment (Ab) was administered. Groups of animals were killed on days 4 and 10 post infection for sample collection. CY treatment was continued until the end of the study. As an internal control for RSV infection without immunosuppression, age-matched normal animals were infected with RSV, treated with saline and killed on days 4 and 10 post infection. (b) White blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocyte count and serum RSV-neutralizing Ab were quantified in blood samples collected from all animals immediately before killing the animal on days 4 and 10 post infection. RI-002 treatment was given as a high/low/low (H/L/L) regime of 1500 mg/kg followed by two doses of 750 mg/kg, or as high/high/high (H/H/H) regime of 1500 mg/kg given three times.
