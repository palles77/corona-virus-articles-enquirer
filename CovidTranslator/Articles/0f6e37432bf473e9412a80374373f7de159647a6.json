Instead, the purpose of this chapter is to provide the reader with an update on selected common and important viral infections in dogs and cats that may be evaluated by emergency and critical care veterinarians. Treatment of viral infections is largely supportive and usually includes intravenous fluid therapy, early enteral or parenteral nutrition, antiemetics, analgesia, and oxygen therapy when pulmonary disease is present. Blood products may be needed for cats with retroviral infections. Antibiotics may be needed for secondary bacterial infections. Attempts to culture secondary bacterial invaders and determine sensitivity to antimicrobial agents should be considered before commencing antimicrobial therapy. Use of antiviral medications is still limited in dogs and cats, but famciclovir can be effective for treatment of severe infections with feline herpesvirus 1.",

            "text": "CDV infection is a contagious disease of dogs that may involve the gastrointestinal (GI), respiratory, or neurologic systems. Distemper still occurs sporadically, even in vaccinated dog populations. Disease most commonly occurs in dogs 3 to 6 months of age, when maternal antibody level is declining, but can occur in older dogs that have been vaccinated infrequently or improperly, especially after stress, immunosuppression, or contact with other affected dogs. 1 CDV is an enveloped ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus that belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae. The virus survives for about 3 hours at room temperature and is highly susceptible to routine hospital disinfectants such as quaternary ammonium compounds. Several strains of CDV exist and vary in pathogenicity. Some, such as the Snyder Hill strain, are more likely to produce neurologic disease than others. A study has documented the existence of CDV strains that differ from vaccine strains and from those previously documented in the United States. 2 cytoplasmic inclusions in epithelial cells when stained with Wright or Diff-Quik stain (Figure 96-1). The sensitivity of cytology is increased after application of immunofluorescent antibody to smears by regional diagnostic laboratories. Smears should be air dried and, if possible, fixed in acetone for 5 minutes before transport. Intracytoplasmic inclusions also may be seen in erythrocytes, lymphocytes, other white blood cells, and cells within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Thoracic radiography may reveal an interstitial pattern or an alveolar pattern with secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia. Analysis of CSF may show increased protein and cell count, and measurement of anti-CDV antibody in the CSF also can be useful for diagnosis in dogs with neurologic signs. Other antemortem diagnostic tests for distemper include immunohistochemistry for CDV antigen on biopsies of nasal mucosa, footpad epithelium, and haired skin of the dorsal neck, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for viral nucleic acid. Specimens suitable for RT-PCR testing include buffy coat cells, whole blood, serum, CSF, and urine. 3 With any PCR assay, quality control can be problematic, and the use of laboratories that perform real-time (fluorogenic) PCR and that have a quality assurance program is recommended. Virus isolation is difficult and is not used widely for diagnosis.",

Poor cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is associated with spread of the virus to a variety of tissues, severe respiratory and GI signs with or without CNS involvement, and death. Dogs with an intermediate or delayed CMI response may develop persistent infection of the uvea, CNS, and footpad and nasal epithelium, leading to neurologic, cutaneous (hard pad), and ocular signs such as chorioretinitis.

Neurologic signs then occur in some dogs, either with systemic illness or after a several-week delay. Neurologic signs are frequently progressive despite treatment and are a poor prognostic sign. Myoclonus, an involuntary twitching of various muscle groups, can be most pronounced when affected dogs are at rest and is virtually pathognomonic for CDV infection. Ocular signs may consist of sudden blindness resulting from optic neuritis, chorioretinitis, or retinal detachment. Cutaneous signs may be useful for prognostication.

CRCoV was reported first in 2003 in a group of dogs with respiratory disease in a rehoming facility in England that had been vaccinated against canine adenovirus-2, CDV, and canine parainfluenza virus. 7 It is distinct from canine enteric coronavirus. Alone, CRCoV causes subclinical infections or mild respiratory disease, but like human respiratory coronaviruses, it may cause reversible damage to, or loss of, the respiratory epithelial cell cilia. As a result, infected dogs become predisposed to secondary infections. Serologic evidence of exposure to CRCoV appears to be widespread in dogs from North America, Great Britain and continental Europe, Japan, Korea and New Zealand, and the virus has been detected widely using PCR-based methods in dogs with respiratory disease from many of these countries. Canine pneumovirus is a parainfluenza virus that belongs to the genus Pneumovirus.

The virus can survive for a year at room temperature on fomites and survives disinfection with routine hospital disinfectants; inactivation generally requires a 1 : 30 dilution of household bleach, potassium peroxymonosulfate, or concentrated accelerated hydrogen peroxide solutions. Feline panleukopenia should be suspected in poorly vaccinated kittens with acute illness including fever, lethargy, anorexia, vomiting and, less commonly, diarrhea.

Severe panleukopenia may be associated with concurrent infection with FeLV. 10 In-house fecal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for CPV are suitable for diagnosis of feline panleukopenia, although false-negative results may occur, so a negative test result does not rule out feline panleukopenia.

Inactivation requires hypochlorite solutions, concentrated accelerated hydrogen peroxide solutions, or potassium peroxymonosulfate; quaternary ammonium compounds are not effective. 13 FHV-1 and FCV infections may be acquired by contact with acutely infected cats, contact with organisms in the environment, or by contact with carrier cats. The chance of infection is increased when large numbers of cats are housed together. Both viruses replicate mainly in the tonsils and respiratory tissues. In addition to the nasal, conjunctival, and oral shedding common to both viruses, FCV also is shed in the feces and occasionally in the urine.",

Clinical signs common to both infections include conjunctivitis, serous or mucopurulent nasal discharge and sneezing and, less commonly, coughing and dyspnea.

The presence of high-protein (5 to 12 g/dl), lowcellularity (predominantly neutrophils) effusion fluid is also supportive of the diagnosis. However, tests such as the serum or effusion albumin-to-globulin ratio, effusion \u03b3-globulin concentration, and the Rivalta test can be associated with false-positive and false-negative results, especially in populations in which the prevalence of FIP is low. 19 Serologic tests that detect anti-FCoV antibody are not FIP tests. Positive test results mean only exposure to a coronavirus, and many healthy cats have positive titers but never develop FIP. In one study, titers of 1 : 1600 or greater in cats that were suspected to have FIP had a 94% chance of truly having FIP, but cats that had any coronavirus antibody titer had a 44% chance of truly having FIP. 19 However, considerable interlaboratory variation in assay results occurs, so this may not be true for serology performed at all laboratories. The same study also showed that immunocytochemistry for feline coronavirus on macrophages in effusion fluid had a specificity of 100% for diagnosis of FIP, although the sensitivity was only 57%. The mutation that occurs when FCoV becomes virulent FIPV is not predictable, and there is no way to distinguish the viruses based on nucleotide sequence.
