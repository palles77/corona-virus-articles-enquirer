We segmented the \u03a6X174 genome into 14 non-toxic and non-replicative fragments compatible with golden gate assembly. We next used nicking mutagenesis with oligonucleotides prepared from unamplified oligo pools with individual segments as templates to prepare near-comprehensive single-site mutagenesis libraries of genes encoding the F capsid protein (421 amino acids scanned) and G spike protein (172 amino acids scanned). Libraries possessed greater than 99% of all 11,860 programmed mutations. Golden Gate cloning was then used to assemble the complete \u03a6X174 mutant genome and generate libraries of infective viruses. This protocol will enable reverse genetics experiments for studying viral evolution and, with some modifications, can be applied for engineering of therapeutically relevant bacteriophages with larger genomes.",

Understanding such changes are important for fundamental evolutionary studies as well as biotechnology applications like phage therapy for multi-drug resistant bacteria (Dedrick et al. 2019) . Two obstacles preventing better predictions are the oversimplification of the environment in experimental evolution studies compared to wild conditions and the vast number of experimentally unexplored mutational combinations that can occur, even in short adaptive walks and small genomes. Advances in DNA sequencing and synthesis have opened new ways to study microbial evolution and overcome some of these obstacles (Barrick et al. 2013 , Fowler et al. 2014 . Unfortunately, suitable methods do not exist for generating comprehensive bacteriophage mutant libraries. This technology gap hinders those seeking to engineer phage for biotechnological applications and for those seeking a deeper understanding of how viruses evolve.",

            "text": "Methods for genetically engineering phages have recently been reviewed (Pires et al. 2016 ) and commonly involve homologous recombination and recombineering. While such approaches can be improved by clever incorporation of CRISPR-Cas systems (Kiro et al. 2014 , Lemay et al. 2017 , Schilling et al. 2018 , the overall modest efficiencies largely limits mutagenesis to the generation and single-site mutation of chimeric genomes (Doore and Fane 2015, Doore et al. 2017) , gene deletions (Uchiyama et al. 2009 ), and limited multi-site mutagenesis (Stockdale et al. 2015) . A recent approach combines mutagenesis by PCR with degenerate (NNK) primers with in-cell recombination to create variation at specific residues in the tail fiber of T3 phage (Yehl et al. 2019) . By contrast, human viruses often have reverse genetics systems in place where comprehensive mutant libraries can be prepared for single genes (Lee et al. 2018) or regions within a gene (Doud et al. 2018 , Wu and Qi 2019) using replicative plasmids that encode whole viruses or viral components. Similarly, deep mutational scanning can be performed on plasmid-encoded phage proteins like the MS2 capsid protein (Hartman et al. 2018) . As described by Hartman et al. 2018 , such experiments can identify mutations that confer useful characteristics, such as MS2 capsid stability mutations that could improve the targeted delivery of therapeutics to particular cellular compartments.",

We synthesized a custom pool of 11,860 oligos that encoded nearly every missense and nonsense mutation in the F and G genes. Each missense or nonsense mutation was encoded by a single oligonucleotide. Application of nicking mutagenesis using this oligo pool for different plasmids (F1, F2, F3, G1, G2) resulted in at least 14-fold excess transformants required for 99.9% theoretical coverage of the desired library (Supplemental Table S3 ). The diversity of the mutant plasmid libraries was validated using deep sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq platform. All plasmid libraries have >99.7% coverage of all possible single mutations (n = 11,821/11,860, minimum counts for a mutation >5, full library statistics are given in Table 1 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/798546 doi: bioRxiv preprint non-susceptible hosts (Agilent XL1-Blue), then plated on susceptible hosts (E. coli C) after a 30-minute recovery in SOC. Viral titers increase rapidly after 30 minutes, suggesting that the XL1-Blue cells do not burst until after this time point (Supplemental Table S5 ). Accordingly, we reasoned that the number of plaques at 30 minutes represents the number of XL1-Blue cells that were transformed with viable genomes. The number of transformants varied considerably between constructs (Table 2) . 19,200 plaques were recovered from the co-transformed G1/ G2 libraries, where only 3,480 total variants were expected in the pool. On the contrary, 460 plaques were observed for the F2 library, when 2,280 total variants were in the starting plasmid pool. The underrepresentation of the F2 library at this scale could be remedied by transforming more competent cells. We expect that differences between fragments in the number of recovered viruses is due to in part to the tolerability of fragments to mutation, as inviable mutants would not form plaques. Estimates from deep mutational scanning of model proteins show that approximately 18-38% of all mutations are nonviable (Firnberg et al. 2014 , Faber et al. 2019 , and this percentage may be larger for structural proteins like F and G.",

When a gene is in multiple fragments, the number of mutational variants we expect from the assembled mutant fragments is the product of their individual variant number. Hence, since G1 contains 2640 variants and G2 contains 800 variants, they can be combined to generate 2.1 million double mutation variants. Further, nothing requires the fragments to be from the same gene. For example, since the F and G proteins bind to each other to form the capsid of phiX174 ( Fig. 2) , libraries combining mutations in F with mutations in G will capture mutations that can readily interact in the protein and have the potential to generate interesting instances of epistasis (Fig 2) . The central challenge then becomes how to survey the vast size of these combinatorial plasmid libraries. Right now, our transformational efficiencies vary, but even at the upper end of hundreds of thousands of transformants per reaction, only a fraction of the total diversity in the library can be surveyed.",

However, most biotech-relevant phages have larger genomes, and extension of this method to other viruses would encounter the following technical challenges. First, increasing genome sizes decrease transformational efficiencies, and larger genomes have increased susceptibility to DNA shearing (Rogers and Bendich 1988) . Both sizedependent effects can disrupt the integrity and coverage of the phage libraries (Edwards and Rohwer 2005) . Second, our method includes restrictions on the DNA sequences that can be used. Golden Gate cloning requires a genome without unique Type IIS restriction sequences, while nicking mutagenesis requires that there be only one orientation of the BbvCI nicking site within the template DNA fragment. Third, ligating 14 fragments is close to the upper limit of Golden Gate cloning. Additionally, increasing the size of individual fragments is difficult as the presented method depends on replicating plasmids in E. coli, and larger fragments are more likely to be toxic in vivo.",

Introduction of nicking sites into shuttle vectors containing viral genes. Verification of the introduction of the BbvCI nicking site into the shuttle vector containing the viral genes is shown by the template prep step in the nicking mutagenesis protocol (generation of ssDNA). Samples were run on a 1% agarose gel with SYBR\u2122 Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen) added before casting, the ladder used is the 1 kb DNA ladder from GoldBio.

Viral titers immediately after transformation (0 min) and then for every 30 min after up to 2 hours. As the XL1-Blue cells are not susceptible, the increase in titer is the result of cell bursts, which releases viable phage. While the virus is replicating for the first 30 minutes, they are all held within a cell and will only make one plaque.

A single oligo pool encoding for all possible single missense and nonsense substitutions in F and G was designed using the custom python scripts from Medina et al. 2019 and custom synthesized by Agilent (full sequences of all oligos are given in the associated file \"VMA_supplemental_data. csv\"). Oligo pools were designed with 20-24 bases of gene overlap flanking the mutated codon. Codons were chosen based on E. coli codon usage frequency, where the highest frequency codon that encoded the mismatch mutation was selected. We printed 14,853 unique oligos, where 14,853 = 12,453 \u03a6X174 primers-2,400 other primers. These oligos encode WT (593 primers) and all 20 possible single point mutations (including stop) (11,860 primers)",
