Therefore, we hypothesize that a MUC1 VNTR TACA-conjugate can be successfully formulated into a liposome-based anti-cancer vaccine. The immunogenicity of the vaccine should be further augmented by incorporating surface displayed L-rhamnose (Rha) epitopes onto the liposomes to take advantage of a natural antibody-dependent antigen uptake mechanism. To validate our hypothesis we synthesized a 20-amino acid MUC1 glycopeptide containing a GalNAc-O-Thr (Tn) TACA by SPPS and conjugated it to a functionalized Toll-like receptor ligand (TLRL). An L-Rhacholesterol conjugate was prepared using tetraethylene glycol (TEG) as a linker. The liposomebased anti-cancer vaccine was formulated by the extrusion method using TLRL-MUC1-Tn conjugate, Rha-TEG-cholesterol and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) in a total lipid concentration of 30 mM. The stability, homogeneity and size characterization of the liposomes was evaluated by SEM and DLS measurements. The formulated liposomes demonstrated positive binding with both anti-Rha and mouse anti-human MUC1 antibodies. Groups of female BALB/c mice were immunized and boosted with a rhamnose-Ficoll (Rha-Ficoll) conjugate formulated with alum as adjuvant to generate the appropriate concentration of anti-Rha antibodies in the mice. Anti-Rha antibody titers were >25-fold higher in the groups of mice immunized with the Rha-Ficoll conjugate than the non-immunized control groups. The mice were then immunized with the TLRL-MUC1-Tn liposomal vaccine formulated either with or without the surface displaying Rha epitopes. Sera collected from the groups of mice initially immunized with Rha-Ficoll and later vaccinated with the Rha-displaying TLRL-MUC1-Tn liposomes showed a >8-fold increase in both anti-MUC1-Tn and anti-Tn antibody titers in comparison to the groups of mice that did not receive Rha-Ficoll. T-cells from BALB/c mice primed with a MUC1-Tn peptide demonstrated increased proliferation to the Rha-liposomal vaccine in the presence of antibodies isolated from Rha-Ficoll immunized mice compared to nonimmune mice, supporting * Corresponding Authors, steve.sucheck@utoledo.edu; kwall@utnet.utoledo.edu.",

[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Numerous TACAs have been identified from the glycoprotein MUC1 obtained from cancer cells of epithelial origin. Some of these antigens include the Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF), Tn, STn as well as \u03b1-2,6-sialyl-TF and \u03b1-2,3-sialyl-TF antigens. 9,10,11 A recent finding made by Finn and coworkers reported that MUC1 variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) containing TACAs were more potent at breaking self tolerance in MUC1 transgenic mice than the unglycosylated VNTR. 12, 13 The authors believe that the glycopeptide is a more 'foreign' like epitope in comparison to the unglycosylated MUC1 which is more 'self' like. Vaccination with TACA-containing MUC1 was successful in generating glycopeptide specific antibodies and boosting previously suppressed MUC1 specific T-cell responses. Further, they identified a population of dendritic cells (DCs) that display the VNTRs bearing the GS(GalNAc-O-T)A epitope on MHC class-II molecules.",

            "text": "We have considered different ways in which a MUC1 glycopeptide could be formulated into an anti-cancer vaccine with improved immunogenicity. We believe that an interesting approach would be to incorporate xenoantigens onto the target antigen. The xenoantigens would complex naturally occurring cognate antibodies which would facilitate uptake of the target antigen by antigen presenting cells (APCs). Past studies have focused on the installation of \u03b1-Gal epitopes on vaccine constructs to boost the immune response with promising results, 14 since human serum is abundant in anti-\u03b1-Gal antibodies. [15] [16] [17] However, recent studies by both Bovin and Gildersleeve on human serum have revealed that even more abundant human natural anti-carbohydrate antibodies are present against the xenoantigen L-rhamnose (Rha). 18, 19 Further, anti-Rha antibodies can be generated in nontransgenic mice in contrast to anti-\u03b1-Gal antibodies, 20, 21 In this paper we explore the Rha eptiope as a noncovalently-linked ligand displayed on the surface of a liposomal vaccine for enhancing the immune response against a tumor-associated glycopeptide fragment of MUC1 in mice producing anti-Rha antibodies. 21 An important strategy for the development of successful anti-cancer vaccines is the efficient delivery of the antigens to the APCs. 22, 23 Liposomes have been effective in the delivery of viral, bacterial and tumor antigens to APCs 24, 25 and have the advantage of protecting peptide-based antigens against proteolysis in vivo. Liposomes also generate multivalency in the vaccine, promoting numerous antigen-antibody interactions facilitating opsonization of the vaccine. Additional mechanisms may also involve Rha epitopes interacting with endogenous B-cell receptors (BCRs) to uptake and present antigens on B-cells. 15 Vaccine immunogenicity can also be improved by the introduction of an adjuvant. Toll-like receptor ligands (TLRL), for example, have potent adjuvant activity. 26 Therefore we incorporated the prototypic TLR-2 ligand, Pam 3 Cys, into our vaccine synthesis to serve the dual role of adjuvant and lipid anchor to a liposome. Further, we envisioned a liposome capable of displaying Rha epitopes, the latter designed to bind endogenous anti-Rha antibodies in human serum. The resulting Ig-vaccine complex would then be taken up by APCs ( Figure 1 ).",

Deprotection of the N \u03b1 -Fmoc group was accomplished by treatment with 25% piperidine in dimethylformamide twice; first for 5 minutes and then a second time for 25 minutes. After the synthesis was complete, the peptide was cleaved from the solid support and deprotected using a modified reagent K cocktail consisting of 88% TFA, 3% thioanisole, 5% ethanedithiol, 2% water and 2% phenol. 4 mL of cleavage cocktail was added to the dried peptide-resin in a 15 mL glass vial blanketed with nitrogen. Cleavage was carried out for 2.5 hrs with gentle magnetic stirring. At the end of the cleavage time, the cocktail mixture was filtered on a Quick-Snap column.

Batch 1 was our positive batch of the liposomes and was formulated with Rha-TEG-cholesterol (10%), Pam 3 Cys-MUC1-Tn 11 (0.69 \u00b5M), DPPC (80%) and cholesterol (10%).

Batch 3 was our control and was formulated with only DPPC (80%) and cholesterol (20%). Particle size can be an important modulator of the immune response for neutral liposomes. 38 Therefore, the homogeneity, stability as well as size characterization of the liposomes were evaluated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging ( Figure 2 ) and dynamic light scatter scattering (DLS) measurements ( Figure  S1 , Supporting Information). All batches of liposomes were found to be stable at 4 \u00b0C for 2 days and were around 100 nm in diameter. An antibody binding study showed positive binding of the Batch 1 liposomes with both our previously generated anti-Rha antibodies 15 as well as mouse anti-human-MUC1 (CD 227) antibodies using FITC goat anti-mouse IgG/ IgM secondary antibodies and fluorescence imaging of the coated liposomes ( Figure 3 ). The binding assay proved that the Rha and the MUC1-Tn epitopes of each conjugate were displayed on the surface of the liposomes. No such antibody binding (both anti-Rha and anti-human MUC1) was observed for the Batch 3 liposomes. Batch 2 liposomes only demonstrated mouse anti-human-MUC1 antibody binding (not shown).",

The naive animals do not contain significant amounts of anti-Rha antibodies. 21 We were interested in immunizing the mice with a Rha conjugate which would show a minimal T-dependant immune response. We focused our attention on the synthesis of a Rha-Ficoll conjugate since the carrier, Ficoll, has been reported to be excellent for generating a T-independent immune response. 39, 40 For the synthesis of the Rha-Ficoll conjugate 16 (Scheme 3), tetraacetyl rhamnopyranoside 12 was glycosylated with 2-azido ethanol in presence of boron trifluoride etherate to generate the peracetylated rhamnose 2-azidoethyl glycoside 13 (83 %). 41, 42 Deacetylation of 13 under Zemplen conditions afforded rhamnose 2-azidoethyl glycoside 14 (86 %) which was reduced by treatment with Pd/charcoal under H 2 atmosphere to furnish the rhamnose 2aminoethyl glycoside 15 (quantitative). 43, 44 Commercially available Ficoll 400 was oxidized by sodium periodate in acetate buffer (pH 4.7) followed by conjugation with 15 via reductive amination using sodium cyanoborohydride in borate buffer (pH 8.0) to produce Rha-Ficoll conjugate 16. 45 The conjugate was purified by filtration through a dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cut off value of 10000 Da. The epitope ratio of 16 was calculated to be 9.44 Rha/Ficoll molecule by hydrolysis of 16 followed by derivatization with 4-amino-N-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl] benzamide (DEAEAB) and comparison of the UV-HPLC peak area with standard curve obtained from DEAEAB derivative of 14 by the methods described by Dalpathado and coworkers. 46 Immunological Results and Discussion",

Two groups of five female BALB/c mice each were immunized on day 0 with Rha-Ficoll/Alum adjuvant (group A) or Rha-OVA/complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (group B). The mice were boosted three more times on days 14, 28 and 42 with either Rha-Ficoll/Alum (group A) or Rha-OVA/incomplete Freund's adjuvant (ICF) (group B). Sera was collected separately from groups A and B after the 3 rd boost and the anti-Rha antibodies in the sera from the two groups of mice were isotyped by screening against Rha-BSA ( Figure S2 , Supporting Information). The results demonstrated the anti-Rha antibody titers in the Rha-OVA immunized mice groups were 100-fold higher than those from the Rha-Ficoll immunized mice. However, the isotype distribution confirmed that Rha-Ficoll and Rha-OVA produced the anti-Rha antibody subclasses in different proportions. Anti-Rha antibodies from Rha-OVA immunization were dominated by IgG1 (65 %) while Rha-Ficoll immunization produced antibodies which comprised mainly of IgG3 (48 %) and IgM (25%). IgG1 and IgG3 act similarly in that they both stimulate high affinity Fc\u03b3RI receptors which trigger responses from macrophages. 47 However, IgG1 also stimulates low affinity Fc\u03b3RIIB receptors which inhibit the signals from the Fc\u03b3RI and B cell receptors thereby diminishing B-cell activity and immunogenicity of macrophages. 48 On the other hand the anti-Rha antibody isotypes from Rha-Ficoll immunized mice serum resemble those naturally occurring in the human serum which is presumed to be generated through a T-independent response. Thus, we anticipated that initial immunization with Rha-Ficoll prior to the vaccine challenge will be a more realistic animal model for the human.",

            "text": "T-cell proliferation assays were performed to determine if the combination of anti-Rha antibodies and Rha-modified liposomal vaccine would potentiate a T-cell proliferative response. In the first part of the study we optimized the proliferation assay conditions. BALB/c mice were immunized (day 0) and boosted (days 14, 28 and 42) with 100 \u00b5L emulsions of MUC1-Tn 10/Sigma adjuvant system (SAS) (50 \u00b5g peptide per mouse, each injection). The mice were sacrificed (day 49), the spleens were removed and single cell suspensions were prepared and incubated with MUC1-Tn (8.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 -1.1 \u00b5g/mL) alone or with syngeneic bone marrow dendritic cells (DCs) previously pulsed with the same doses of antigen. We observed that DCs enhanced proliferation ( Figure S3 , Supporting Information), as had been previously observed for C57BL/6 mice. 12 To test the ability of anti-Rha antibodies to enhance antigen presentation, spleen cells from BALB/c mice immunized as above were prepared. DCs from BALB/c bone marrow (Supporting Information) were pulsed with the antigen by incubating with Pam 3 Cys-MUC1-Tn + Rha liposomes at antigen concentrations of 8.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 -0.22 \u00b5g/mL together with antibodies isolated from either Rha-Ficoll or Rha-OVA immunized mice or nonimmune mice. The pulsed DCs were added to the spleen cells and proliferation assessed after 3 days. The spleen T-cells proliferated better in presence of anti-Rha antibodies (from both Rha-Ficoll and Rha-OVA immunized mice serum) than in the presence of control serum antibodies over the antigen concentration range of 8.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 -0.22 \u00b5g/mL ( Figure 4A ). Also the T-cell proliferation was higher in presence of anti-Rha antibodies generated against Rha-Ficoll (6328, 6045 and 6521 counts per minute (cpm) at antigen concentrations of 8.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , 0.044 and 0.22 \u00b5g/mL) than those against Rha-OVA (5018, 4926 and 4880 cpm at antigen concentrations of 8.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , 0.044 and 0.22 \u00b5g/mL), even though the titer of anti-Rha antibodies was higher in the serum of Rha-OVA immunized mice. The results strongly suggest that the Rha-modified antigen was more effectively internalized and presented by the APCs in the presence of anti-Rha antibodies, particularly those less-inhibitory isotypes characteristic of natural antibodies and generated by Rha-Ficoll immunization. Therefore, we concluded that BALB/c mice in which anti-Rha antibodies are generated with Rha-Ficoll 16 immunization will be an appropriate model for the immunogenicity of the Rha-conjugated MUC1-Tn liposomes.",

The data showed that groups A1, A2 and B1 had similar absorbance at 1/25, 1/50. 1/100 and 1/200 serum dilutions. This proved that prior immunization with Rha-Ficoll does not affect the response to a non-Rha conjugated vaccine (groups A1 and A2). In addition the Rha epitopes on the vaccine do not alter the inherent immunogenicity of the MUC1-Tn epitopes on the vaccine (groups A1 and B1). The anti-MUC1-Tn titers for group B2 showed an 8-fold increase compared to groups A1, A2 and B1 which was mediated by the anti-Rha antibody-dependent antigen-uptake. Group B2 had an anti-MUC1-Tn titer of approximately 1/300, where titer is defined as the highest dilution giving a signal >0.1 above background. The anti-MUC1-Tn antibodies from each group were isotyped ( Figure S4 , Supporting Information) which showed that group B2 showed an increase in IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgM isotypes relative to the other 3 groups. The specificity of the antibodies towards MUC1-Tn antigen was determined by a competitive binding experiment ( Figure 6A ). Serum from every group at 1/100 dilution was incubated with the MUC1-Tn conjugate 10 at concentrations of 0, 10 \u22125 , 10 \u22124 , and 10 \u22123 M in 0.01 M PBS prior to addition in the ELISA plates coated with the conjugate 10. The absorbances decreased uniformly with increasing concentrations of free MUC1-Tn in the serum dilutions for each group. As an example, the absorbances at 620 nm for the serum dilution of group B2 at free MUC1-Tn concentrations of 0, 10 \u22125 , 10 \u22124 and 10 \u22123 M were 0.790, 0.601, 0.577 and 0.512 respectively.

These cells express MUC1 on their surface as shown by binding with mouse anti-human MUC1 antibodies (CD 227) ( Figure 7A ). Serum from group B2 mice also recognized the MUC1 on the tumor cells with similar efficiency as the CD 227 antibodies relative to non-immunized mouse serum ( Figure 7B ). This demonstrates that the antibodies generated against the glycopeptide recognize the MUC1 protein in its native environment.",

The resulting liposomes were homogenous in size and were stable at 4 \u00b0C for two days. Binding studies with both anti-Rha and mouse anti-human MUC1 antibodies revealed that the Rha and the MUC1 glycopeptide epitopes were surface displayed on the liposomes. A Rha-Ficoll conjugate was synthesized for the generation of anti-Rha antibodies in mice. The in vitro proliferation of MUC1-Tn primed mice spleen Tcells showed increased proliferation to Rha-liposomes in the presence of antibodies from Rha-Ficoll immunized mice relative to nonimmune mice. Vaccination studies with Rha-and non-Rha-displaying MUC1-Tn liposomes in mice either non-immunized or immunized with Rha-Ficoll illustrated that anti-MUC1-Tn and anti-Tn antibodies were >8-fold higher in the groups of mice previously immunized with Rha-Ficoll and later vaccinated with the Pam 3 Cys-MUC1-Tn + Rha liposomes. The anti-MUC1-Tn antibodies in the serum of the vaccinated mice recognized the aberrant MUC1 on human leukemia U266 cells. Overall this vaccine successfully triggered both T cell and humoral immunity enhanced by anti-Rha antibody dependant antigen uptake. Because this vaccine uses separate rhamnose and antigenic epitope components, the vaccine can easily be targeted to different antigens or epitopes by changing the peptide without having to change the other components.",

Chloroform was removed by subjecting the lipid solutions to a constant stream of nitrogen. The resulting lipid films were dried under vacuum overnight. The dried lipid films were hydrated with 2 mL of HEPES buffer (pH = 7.4). The suspensions of the lipids in the buffer were agitated at 43 \u00b0C for 40 mins. The suspensions were subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles (dry ice/acetone and water at 40 \u00b0C).
