Duckweed is also fed to animals as a diet complement because of its high nutritional value. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a major causative agent of fatal diarrhea in piglets and is a serious problem in the hog-raising industry. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of producing a protective antigen for the PEDV spike protein 1 using duckweed, Lemna minor. Stably transformed Lemna were obtained by co-cultivation with A. tumefaciens EHA105 harboring the PEDV spike protein gene. Transgene integration and expression of the PEDV spike protein 1 gene were confirmed by genomic PCR and RT-PCR and western blot analysis of transgenic Lemna, respectively. This is the first report of the expression of a vaccine antigen against an animal infectious disease in duckweed.",

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a known causative agent of PED. PEDV is an enveloped RNA with a single, positive-stranded genome, belonging to the group I coronaviruses (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . PEDV infects intestinal epithelial cells and causes loss of enterocytes with villous atrophy, resulting in diarrhea and dehydration (Coussement et al., 1982) . Development of effective vaccination strategies against PEDV infection is important because PEDV-induced disease is a serious problem in the hog-raising industry. Edible vaccines delivered to mucosal surfaces may be good candidates for a vaccination system for inducing modulated systemic immune responses without injection-related hazards. The antigen protein corresponding to the neutralizing epitope of the PEDV spike protein has been successfully expressed in a transgenic tobacco plant (Kang et al., 2005 (Kang et al., , 2006 .",

Approximately 78% of the fronds were bleached on day 30 in culture medium containing 100 mg L -1 kanamycin. The phytotoxic effect of kanamycin was noticeable at 200 mg L -1 in the medium as fronds started to bleach between day 10 and day 14 of culture, resulting in a total loss of chlorophyll pigmentation (bleaching) by day 30.",

(2001) established efficient genetic transformation protocols for two duckweed species, L. gibba (geographic isolate G3) and L. minor (geographic isolates 8627 and 8744; strain number is designation in Lemnaceae Germplasm Collection). Only selection with 10 mg L -1 kanamycin was used for the transformation of L. gibba G3 and L. minor 8744, while concentrations of up to 100 mg L -1 were used for L. minor 8627 (Yamamoto et al., 2001) . In our experiments, kanamycin at a comparatively high concentration (200 mg L -1 ) was used. This difference may be due to different sensitivity to antibiotics of various geographic isolates of Lemna. Moon et al. (1998) reported that proliferation of Lemna fronds varied six-fold across the 25 geographic isolates of Lemna collected at various geographical locations around the world. As described above, the Lemna used in this study was collected from a rice field in Daejeon, Korea. The fronds of Lemna were transformed by co-cultivation with A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 harboring the PEDV spike protein1 gene fused to a c-myc tag. The c-myc tag sequence was introduced into the vector to facilitate purification of the target recombinant proteins. Kanamycin-resistant fronds were transferred to liquid medium containing kanamycin and subcultured under the high selection pressure. The liquid environment allows the antibiotic to contact the entire surface of the plant, thus ensuring reliable selection (Yamamoto et al., 2001) .",
