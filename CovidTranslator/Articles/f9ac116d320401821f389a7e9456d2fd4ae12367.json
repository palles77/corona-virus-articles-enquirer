Objective: With the application of DNA microarrays, we could monitor the effects of pathogens on host-cell gene expression programmes in great depth and on a broad scale. Methods: Changes in mRNA expression levels of human endothelial-like ECV304 cells following infection with human cytomegalovirus AD169 strain was analyzed by a microarray system comprising 21073 60-mer oligonucleotide probes which represent 18716 human genes or transcripts. Results: The results from cDNA microarray showed that there were 559 differential expressed genes consisted of 471 upregulated genes and 88 down-regulated genes. Real-time qPCR was performed to validate the expression of 6 selected genes (RPS24, MGC8721, SLC27A3, MST4, TRAF2 and LRRC28), and the results of which were consistent with those from the microarray. Among 237 biology processes, 39 biology processes were found to be related significantly to HCMV-infection. The signal transduction is the most significant biological process with the lowest p value (p=0.005) among all biological process which involved in response to HCMV infection. Conclusion: Several of these gene products might play key roles in virus-induced pathogenesis. These findings may help to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of HCMV caused diseases.",

            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), which is a species of the cytomegalovirus family of viruses and is alternatively known as human herpesvirus-5 (HHV-5), is the most common pathogen causing congenital infection and primary infection during pregnancy 1 . It can cause life-threatening systemic infections in immunocompromised patients and has been recognized as a risk factor for vascular diseases, like arterial restenosis and atherosclerosis 2 . The impacts of HCMV has increased in recent decades due to the rising risk of organ allografting, immunosuppressive treatment, radiation damage, malignant tumor, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients 3, 4 . As the number of patients suffering from HCMV infections has steadily increased, there is a growing need to understand the molecular mechanism by which the virus causes disease. HCMV can infect many different cell types in vivo, such as smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, epithelialcells, neuronal cells, monocyte/macrophage lineage cells and so on [5] [6] [7] . Cytopathic effects of HCMV are varied in different tissues and cell lines. Endothelial cells are natural sites of HCMV infection in vivo following a primary infection and are a possible viral reservoir, suggest that endothelial cells may play a role in viral spread and persistence 8, 9 . HCMV infection of endothelial cells is also associated with atherosclerosis and transplant vascular sclerosis in HCMV-infected patients, pointing to the possible role that infected endothelial cells may play in HCMVmediated diseases. However, the specific mechanisms by which HCMV infects endothelial cells remain unclear. Virus-induced phenotypic changes in host cells are often accompanied with marked changes in gene expression that are related with the pathogenic mechanisms. In the last few years, studies showed that changes in gene expression that occur on different host cell types with different types of viral infections 10 . Therefore, analysis of changes in gene expression that occur on infection of endothelial cells with HCMV will be better for revealing the pathogenic mechanisms of HCMV. DNA expression profiling microarrays are designed to monitoring of hundreds and thousands mRNA levels, and therefore, analysis of those data from microarray experiment can provide us important information to understand the biological processes and complex pathogenesis of infectious diseases. This technology has also been used in studies on differenet target cells infected with HCMV, which are different performance depended on probe characteristics, array density, sample labeling methods and the characteristics of target cell [11] [12] [13] [14] . Because most studies aimed at human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) as target cell which infected by HCMV, gene expression profiling of endothelial cells infected HCMV has not yet been studied intensively.",

The Cy5-and Cy3labeled targets are purified using Rneasy mini spin columns (Qiagen), and then mixed and hybridized to the 60mer Human 1A Oligo Microarray Kit (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The hybridization volume of 450\u00b5l consisted of 7\u00b5g of each Cy3and Cy5-labeled sample, 50\u00b5l 10\u00d7control target and 225\u00b5l 2\u00d7hybridization buffer.

The slides were then dried with nitrogen and stored in dark place.Scanning was performed with an Agilent 2565BA scanner (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and the data of the images were acquired using Agilent G2567AA Feature Extraction Software (version 7.1.1). The features were automatically loaded with a grid file and calculated the centroid positions of each spot on the microarray. The Cookie Cutter method was used to define the features. Filtering was automatically performed by first excluding outlier pixels of features and background regions by flagging. The net Cy3 and Cy5 signal intensities for each feature were formed by subtracting the mean of the pixels in the local background from the mean of the pixels in the feature. Considering the features as the real indicators of expression, the spots were included whose foreground signals were significantly greater than the local background signals and additionally, g(r) backgrounds were greater than 2.6 g(r) background standard deviation. Any differences in dye signal intensity were normalized using LOWESS method and a reliable log ratio, p-value and log ratio error for each feature was calculated to give a confidence measure that a gene has been differently expressed. The Onto-Express (OE) software and Annotation Database were used to ananlyze biology processes and annotate genes for the result of microarray, respectively. Validation of microarray results by Real time qPCR cDNAs were reverse transcribed from total RNA extracted from HCMV AD169 infected and uninfected ECV304 cells.

The detail information of special\u00b0C primers are showed in Table 1 . At the end of the program, the specificity of the primer set was confirmed by melting curve analysis (65-95\u00b0C with a heating rate of 0.5\u00b0C/min). The copy numbers of target genes and GAPDH mRNA were estimated by comparing the results of real-time PCR with several dilutions (102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107 copies/ reaction).

In 1998, Zhu et al 18 . firstly used DNA array technology to global monitor the levels of about 6600 human mRNAs in HCMV-infected cells as compared with uninfected ones. The level of 258 mRNAs changed by a factor of 4 or more before the onset of viral DNA replication. Several of these mRNAs encode gene products that might play key roles in virus-induced pathogenesis. So it is important to identify them as intriguing targets for further study. In previous study, they used differential display analysis to assess the effect of HCMV infection on the accumulation of cellular RNAs. Fifty-seven partial cDNA clones were isolated, representing about 26 differentially expressed mRNAs. 11 of these mRNAs were virus-coded, and 15 were of cellular origin. But the detection throughput and sensitivity using differential display analysis were lower than those from DNA microarray technology 18, 19 . Browne et al [11] . used gene chip technology to analyze the effect of HCMV infection on cellular mRNA accumulation and 1425 cellular mRNAs, which include cell cycle regulators, apoptosis regulators, inflammatory pathway genes and immune regulators, were found to be up-regulated or down-regulated by threefold or greater. Simmen et al 12 . showed that HCMV-regulated gene expression profile in fibroblasts using high-density cDNA microarrays and found that the interaction of gB with its as yet unidentified cellular receptor is the principal mechanism by which HCMV alters cellular gene expression early during infection. These results suggested that HCMV could affect the expression of host genes through many mechanisms. However, most studies just focused on human fibroblast as the host cell infected by HCMV.",

This protein is a glycosylated mitogen that specifically acts on endothelial cells and has various effects, including mediating increased vascular permeability, inducing angiogenesis, vasculogenesis and endothelial cell growth, promoting cell migration, and inhibiting apoptosis. In our study, up-regulated VEGF gene might associate with some damage induced by HCMV as its function in cell biological process. RGS6 (regulator of G-protein signaling 6) and RGS2 (regulator of G-protein signaling 2), which are decode regulators of G protein and have been shown to modulate the functioning of G proteins by activating the intrinsic GTPase activity of the alpha (guanine nucleotide-binding) subunits. Signalling by G proteins is controlled by the regulator of Gprotein signalling (RGS) proteins that accelerate the GTPase activity of Galpha subunits and act in a Gprotein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-specific manner. Because GPCRs play a crucial role in cellular communication, and chemokine receptors are essential for leukocyte trafficking in particular. The virus-encoded GPCRs (vGPCRs) may be crucial determinants of viral pathogenesis 21 . Expression of vGPCRs may play a prominent role in immune evasion, promoting virus dissemination, or modulating cellular responses of infected cells. Within the HCMV genome, four genes encoding GPCRs have previously been identified (US27, US28, UL33, and UL78) 22 . On the basis of sequence alignments, it has been identified that HCMV may effectively use UL33 to orchestrate multiple signaling networks within infected cells.",

This cytokine encoded by TNFSF9 is a ligand for TNFRSF9/4-1BB, which is a costimulatory molecule in T lymphocytes. This cytokine and its receptor are involved in the antigen presentation process, and in the generation of cytotoxic T cells. It is found to express in various cancer cell lines, involve in T celltumor cell interaction, and also be required for the optimal CD8 responses in CD8 T cells. This protein decoded by TNFSF10 preferentially induces apoptosis in transformed and tumor cells, but does not appear to kill normal cells although it is expressed at a significant level in most normal tissues. This protein binds to several members of TNF receptor superfamily including TNFRSF10A/TRAILR1, NFRSF10B/TRAILR2, TNFRSF10C /TRAILR3, TNFRSF10D /TRAILR4, and possibly also to TNFRSF11B/OPG. The activity of this protein may be modulated by binding to the decoy receptors TNFRSF10C/TRAILR3, TNFRSF10D/TRAILR4, and TNFRSF11B/OPG that cannot induce apoptosis. The binding of this protein to its receptors has been shown to trigger the activation of MAPK8/ JNK, caspase 8, and caspase 3. Our study showed the two genes were regulated by HCMV. It was found that the biological process, such as S phase of mitotic cell cycle, was significant in HCMV infection. DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. The protein decoded by DDX11 gene is most important component in regulation of mitotic cell cycle. DDX11 is a homolog of the yeast CHL1 gene, and may function to maintain chromosome transmission fidelity and genome stability. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division 23 . In our previous study, the change of S phase effected by the HCMV infection in ECV304 cells at four days post-infection was demonstrated. HCMV productively infect terminally differentiated cells of the host that are in the G0 phase of the cell cycle. Human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells are widely used for permissive HCMV infection in tissue culture. These cells withdraw from the cell cycle on contact inhibition and are in G0 arrest or G1 phase. Because HCMV do not encode many of the biosynthetic enzymes for DNA precursor synthesis, the virus requires a mechanism to overcome cellular quiescence. HCMV infection induces the progression of quiescent cells toward the G1_S transition point and activates cellular genes required for DNA replication such as thymidine kinase (TK) 24 , dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) 25 , cyclin E 26 and DNA polymerase 27 . Genes that are differentially expressed during infection can potentially provide insights into the complex regulatory phenomena at the transcriptional level within ECV304 cells in response to HCMV infection. Up-regulated genes may represent host responses to stress stimuli and/or viral induced mechanisms of pathogenesis. On the other hand, the downregulation of other cellular transcripts may be partially attributed to the shutoff of host macromolecular synthesis in favor of viral replication.",

This kinase is known to play a critical role in mitogen growth factor signal transduction. Subsequently it phosphorylates and thus activates MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK2/ERK3. The activation of this kinase itself is dependent on the Ser/Thr phosphorylation by MAP kinase kinase kinases. The inhibition or degradation of this kinase is found to be involved in the pathogenesis of Yersinia and anthrax. v-CRK avian sarcoma virus CT10-homolog-like (CRKL) contains one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains. CRKL has been shown to activate the RAS and JUN kinase signaling pathways and transform fibroblasts in a RAS-dependent fashion. It is a substrate of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase and plays a role in fibroblast transformation by BCR-ABL. In addition, CRKL has oncogenic potential. MICA gene encodes the higly polymorphic MHC (HLA) class I chain-related gene A. The protein product is expressed on the cell surface, although unlike canonical class I molecules does not seem to associate with beta-2-microglobulin. It is thought that MICA functions as a stress-induced antigen that is broadly recognized by intestinal epithelial gamma delta T cells. MICB gene encodes a heavily glycosylated protein which is a ligand for the NKG2D type II receptor. Binding of the ligand activates the cytolytic response of natural killer (NK) cells, CD8 alphabeta T cells, and gammadelta T cells which express the receptor. This protein is stressinduced and is similar to MHC class I molecules; however, it does not associate with beta-2microglobulin or bind peptides. HCMV infection is associated with graft rejection by upregulating expression of MICA and MICB 29 . Cyclin E decoded by CCNE1 gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein abundance through the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases. Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This protein accumulates at the G1-S phase boundary and is degraded as cells progress through S phase. Overexpression of this gene has been observed in many tumors, which results in chromosome instability, and thus may contribute to tumorigenesis. Cyclin E/cdk2 kinase activity can be activated by the immediate-early genes, IE1 and IE2, in HCMV infected cells. Transactivation of the cyclin E promoter by IE2 has been reported 30 , but the mechanism for IE1 activation of cyclin E/cdk2 kinase activity in HCMV-infected cells is still unclear. In this study, our experimental results are in agreement with the results obtained by Vierling et al.",

Though the roles of the cellular genes discussed above in HCMV replication and pathogenesis remain highly speculative, the ability to identify cellular genes whose functions provide tantalizing hints of potential mechanistic roles in infectious disease processes underscores the utility of cDNA microarray technology in the study of pathogens. The global analysis of changes in mRNA levels provides a catalog of genes that are modulated as a result of the host-pathogen interaction and therefore deserve further scrutiny. DNA array analysis provides an important new approach for the investigation of pathogenic mechanisms.",
