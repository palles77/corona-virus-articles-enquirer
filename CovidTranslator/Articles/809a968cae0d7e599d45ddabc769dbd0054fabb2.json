Here the authors report that splenocytes depleted of CD4 + T lymphocytes prior to adoptive transfer retained their ability to control viral expression in the brain. In sharp contrast, depletion of the CD8 + T-cell population prior to transfer abolished the suppressive effect, with sixfold greater expression in the brain than when undepleted splenocytes were used. The authors went on to examine the contributions of cytokine-and perforin-mediated mechanisms in controlling MCMV brain infection using splenocytes from major histocompatibility (MHC)-matched IFN\u03b3-knockout (GKO), and perforin-knockout (PKO) mice. When used in adoptive transfer studies, splenocytes from GKO mice controlled viral expression; however, cells from PKO mice could not control reporter gene expression or viral DNA replication in brain tissues. The authors have previously reported that the levels of the T-cell chemoattractant CXCL10 are highly elevated in the brains of MCMV-infected mice. Here the authors found that the receptor for this ligand, CXCR3, was not essential in mediating the suppressive effects of adoptive transfer. These data indicate that peripheral CD8 + T cells control MCMV brain infection through a perforin-mediated mechanism and that neither IFN-\u03b3 nor CXCR3 play a critical role in this neuroprotective response.

            "text": "Neuroimmune responses to viral infections of the brain must clear the invading pathogen while simultaneously preventing extensive damage to this vital nonregenerating tissue (Patterson et al, 2002) . T lymphocytes are known to mediate their antiviral functions by a variety of mechanisms, including the production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 , as well as through cytotoxic mechanisms involving Fas/FasL and perforin (Finke et al, 1995; Guidotti and Chisari, 2000; Medana et al, 2000; Ruby and Ramshaw, 1991; Tishon et al, 1995) . T lymphocytes use different immune mechanisms tailored to control viral infections in particular organs, and it is becoming increasingly clear that target cell type-specific mechanisms within particular tissues also exist. For example, in the central nervous system (CNS), IFN-\u03b3 production by infiltrating T lymphocytes has been shown to play an important role in clearance of viral infections from neurons without concomitant neuronal loss (Binder and Griffin, 2001; Kundig et al, 1993; Patterson et al, 2002; Tishon et al, 1995) . However, T cells control mouse hepatits virus replication in microglia and astrocytes through perforin-mediated cytolysis, whereas they use IFN\u03b3 -mediated mechanisms to regulate viral replication in oligodendrocytes (Bergmann et al, 2004; Stohlman et al, 2002) . It is likely that other CNS pathogens also encounter similar diverse neuroimmune responses at the level of cellular tropism.",

            "text": "To determine which T lymphocyte subpopulation was responsible for mediating the suppressive effect of adoptive transfer on MCMV brain infection, either CD4 + (L3T4) or CD8 + (Lyt-2) cells were separately removed from total splenocytes obtained from primed mice by immunomagnetic depletion. Following depletion, the splenocytes were transferred into immunodeficient C.B-17 SCID/bg mice via tail-vein injection 24 h prior to icv injection of MCMV. When reporter gene expression in the infected brains was assessed using a chemiluminescence assay at 6 days post icv infection, we found that cells which had been depleted of the CD4 + T-lymphocyte population prior to adoptive transfer retained the ability to control viral expression in the brain, similar to undepleted splenocytes ( Figure 1A ). In sharp contrast, Figure 1 CD8 + splenocytes reduce reporter gene expression from the MCMV genome during brain infection. Splenocytes (1 \u00d7 10 7 cells) obtained from MCMV (Smith strain)-primed, MHC-matched (H-2 d ) mice (adoptive transfer) or splenocytes depleted of CD8 + (Lyt-2 + ) or CD4 + (L3T4) T cells ( CD8 and CD4, respectively) by immunomagnetic depletion using Dynabeads were transferred into immunodeficient C.B-17 SCID/bg mice 24 h prior to icv infection with MCMV RM461 (3 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 ). (A) At 6 days post icv infection, reporter gene expression from the viral genome was measured using a chemiluminescence assay. The level of reporter gene expression in the brains of SCID/bg mice that did not receive transferred splenocytes is also shown (SCID/bg). Composite data from four to seven animals per group are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM luminescent counts per second (LCPS/mg protein) ( \u2020 \u2020 P < .01 versus SCID/bg; * P < .05 versus adoptive transfer; Student's t test) (B) Viral load in brain tissue homogenates obtained from animals in each treatment group was quantified using real-time PCR (6 days post infection). The amount of MCMV DNA was standardized to \u03b2-actin and is presented as mean \u00b1 SEM normalized copy number from pooled data using three to five animals per group. (C) Efficiency of magnetic depletion of CD8 + or (D) CD4 + cells from total splenocytes was assessed by flow cytometry using a PE-conjugated anti-murine CD8 or anti-CD4 specific Mab (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). depletion of the CD8 + T cells prior to adoptive transfer abolished the subsequent suppressive effect on viral brain infection, with sixfold greater expression than adoptive transfer using undepleted splenocytes ( Figure 1A ). The results obtained by reporter gene expression assay were further corroborated by measuring viral load in brain tissue homogenates obtained from animals in each treatment group using realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ( Figure 1B ). The chemiluminescence assay measured reporter gene expression from the viral genome whereas realtime PCR quantified the extent of viral DNA replication. Remarkably similar results showing depletion of the CD8 + T cells prior to adoptive transfer abolished the subsequent suppressive effect on viral brain infection were obtained using chemiluminescence assay and real-time PCR. Because the efficiency of magnetic depletion can be variable, we carried out flow cytometry studies using anti-mouse CD8 and CD4 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to measure the depletion of each T-cell subset from total splenocytes prior to performing adoptive transfer. These studies demonstrated that the efficiency of magnetic depletion was >99% for both CD8 and CD4 cells ( Figure 1C and D, respectively).",

Following adoptive transfer via tail-vein injection, it was found that splenocytes from GKO mice were able to suppress MCMV brain infection as capably as cells obtained from wild-type animals. It is likely that T lymphocytes use distinct immune mechanisms to control viral replication in particular types of brain cells. For example, in the mouse hepatitis virus model, CD8 + T cells have been shown to possess the ability to inhibit virus replication in all brain cell types; however, viral inhibition by these lymphocytes is mediated through different, cell type-specific mechanisms (Bergmann et al, 2004) . Cytolytic activity in the absence of IFN-\u03b3 suppresses the infection in astrocytes, but not oligodendrocytes; whereas lymphocytes that secreted IFN-\u03b3 , but lacked cytolytic activity, inhibited replication in oligodendrocytes, but not astrocytes (Bergmann et al, 2004) .

When splenocytes from PKO animals were used in adoptive transfer experiments, they were unable to control viral expression in the brain. This failure of splenocytes deficient in the perforin pathway to control MCMV brain infection was confirmed using real-time PCR to quantify the extent of viral DNA replication in the CNS. Interestingly, the levels of viral expression in the brain were actually higher in PKO mice than in mice not receiving any adoptive transfer of splenocytes. There are many possible explanations for why more expression from the viral genome is observed in the PKO recipient mice than in the SCID/bg controls and it is interesting that similar results are observed following staining with X-gal (i.e., more blue cells present in brain sections from perforin knockouts). It could be that the splenocytes from PKO mice respond to greater amounts of virus in the brain by producing more cytokines, which stimulate promoter activity, and, therefore, more reporter gene expression is observed. We do not know if the increased reporter gene expression observed in the brains of PKO splenocyte recipients worsens the outcome, relative to nonrecipients, because MCMV brain infection is lethal in both groups.",
