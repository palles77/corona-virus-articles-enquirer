In this Review we discuss how the size, shape, charge, porosity and hydrophobic properties of a compound influence its effects on the immune response and how nanotechnology can be used to engineer each of these properties (FIG. 1) . We review the role of nanotechnology with respect to its applications in the development of vaccines and immunosuppressive agents, and we highlight how the manipulation and control of objects at the nanoscale level (BOX 1) can contribute to our understanding, as well as to our targeting, of the immune response. The field of nanotechnology is vast, therefore including all of the relevant studies is beyond the scope of this Review. However, we provide examples of selected studies that show the broad range of immunological applications of nanotechnology.",

Notably, smaller nanoparticles (25-40 nm in size) 6 penetrate tissue barriers and traffic to the draining lymph nodes more rapidly than larger nanoparticles (greater than 100 nm in size), which are typically retained by cells at the site of injection and which need to be taken up and trafficked by dendritic cells (DCs) to facilitate their transport to the lymph nodes 6,7 (FIG. 2) .

The use of a recombinant protein engineered to self-assemble into a VLP in the recombinant HBV vaccine was a major advance in safety, and the plasmabased HBV vaccine has now been replaced 15 . However, this first generation of VLP-based vaccines requires adjuvants for optimal immunogenicity in healthy individuals and is not highly effective in high-risk populations such as immunosuppressed patients and elderly individuals. In addition, the HBV vaccines are highly effective as a prophylactic vaccine but ineffective as a therapeutic vaccine. The formulation of HBV vaccines with aluminium (alum) adjuvants is a major limitation with respect to the effective induction of T cellmediated immunity against chronic hepatitis B, as alum predominantly activates T helper 2 (T H 2)-type immune responses 19, 20 . The HPV vaccine that has more recently been developed uses monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) added to alum as an adjuvant to induce a T H 1-type immune response and CTLs that are associated with antiviral immunity 19, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

            "text": "Although current VLP-based vaccines are only prophylactically efficacious but have limitations for use in therapeutic applications, these vaccines have an excellent safety record 26 . Recombinant HBV vaccines have been licensed since 1986 and hundreds of millions of doses have been administered worldwide. Pitfalls of advancing any new technology, such as novel adjuvants that enhance the immune response, include the potential risks of inducing rare, but serious, adverse reactions that only become evident after the evaluation of hundreds of thousands of individuals. Concerns about the induction of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis, following VLPbased vaccination have been raised but have not been confirmed 27 . In a systematic review of the association between multiple sclerosis and hepatitis B vaccination, 1 out of 12 studies reported an association. The authors of that review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to modify vaccination schedules and called for additional studies to be carried out 27 . VLPs and other emerging nanoparticle-based technologies provide new strategies to enhance the induction of potent, long-lasting and potentially broadly reactive (multiclade neutralization) humoral and cellular immune responses that will be crucial to achieve protection and therapy against chronic infections, rapidly mutating pathogens such as influenza and HIV-1, and late-stage malignant diseases as discussed below. These benefits must be balanced against any real or perceived risks so that the use of the vaccine is high and a benefit to public health is achieved. 28 to enhance nanoparticle assembly and to stabilize the three-dimensional conformational structure of protein antigens provides an intriguing vaccine strategy to stimulate neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1. In contrast to enveloped HIV-1 VLPs, which are limited by low Env density per virion 4, 29, 30 , or to the self-assembling peptide nanoparticles (SAPNs) described below, the synthetic approach does not require recombinant DNA technology or the expression and the purification of the monomer proteins from producer cells. Lipopeptidebased synthetic VLPs (20-30 nm in size) have been used to repetitively display a peptide-mimetic epitope derived from the V3-variable loop of gp120 (REF. 31 ). This engineered epitope was designed by modelling the stable three-dimensional \u03b2-hairpin conformation that is formed after the binding of a broadly cross-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody to the gp120 antigen. This synthetic VLP also incorporated a universal T H cell epitope 32 (this immunogenic peptide promiscuously binds to multiple different MHC class II molecules to improve the induction of T H cells) and a tripalmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine (Pam3Cys) lipid moiety, which induces TLR2 activation. Interestingly, the immunization of New Zealand white rabbits with these synthetic VLPs alone induced the production of neutralizing antibodies against the envelope proteins of multiple HIV-1 strains 31 . Thus, structural vaccinology and other strategies for immunogen design 29, 33 , in combination with repetitive antigen display using nanoparticle-based technologies as a vaccine platform, might enable the induction of responses against poorly accessible but conserved neutralizing epitopes rather than against more readily accessible immuno dominant non-neutralizing epitopes expressed on the native gp120 spike 29 . Responses against these poorly accessible epitopes are required to overcome the extraordinary mutation rate and the diversification of HIV-1 during the course of infection and to prevent viral escape. The design of synthetic nanoparticles to incorporate lipid moieties for the conformational stabilization of protein antigens, such as the membrane-proximal external region of gp41, is also of great interest as certain Figure 1 | Examples of nanotechnologies applied to immunoregulation. Nanotechnologies that can be applied to immunoregulation include nanoparticles (parts a-c), nanoemulsions (parts d-f) and virus-like particles (parts g-h). Nanoparticles include dendrimers which branch out (part a), carbon molecules known as spherical fullerenes (part b) and cylindrical carbon molecules known as cylindrical fullerenes (part c). Nanoemulsions incorporate immiscible components such as oil and water that might form amphiphilic molecules such as micelles (part d), liposomes with a lipid bilayer (part e) and oil-in-water emulsions (part f). Virus-like particles are self-assembled structures composed of one or more viral capsid proteins (part g), whereas synthetic virus-like particles are self-assembled from chemically synthesized components (part h). Examples of the relationship between nanoparticle size and bioactivity are shown in (part i).",

The US National Nanotechnology Initiative aims to expedite the discovery, the development and the deployment of nanoscale technology for public benefit, and defines nanotechnology on the basis of size alone, using the range of 1 to 100 nm 122 . Other groups, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), define nanotechnology on the basis of scale and function, using the range of 1 to 1,000 nm, provided that the physical, chemical or biological effects of the material in question are attributable to its dimensions 123 . The European Medicines Agency (EMA) initially defined nanotechnology in the range of 0.2 to 100 nm in size but has broadened the definition to less than 1,000 nm in size 124 . Nature Reviews | Immunology The immunostimulatory activity of nanoscale materials has been attributed to diverse mechanisms: the delivery of antigens, including particle size-dependent tissue penetration and access to the lymphatics (part a); a depot effect, which promotes the persistence, the stability, the conformational integrity and the gradual release of vaccine antigens (part b); and repetitive antigen display in which the spatial organization of the antigens on the particle surface facilitates B cell receptor (BCR) co-aggregation, triggering and activation (part c). Additional mechanisms associated with innate immune potentiation include Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent and TLR-independent signal transduction (not shown); cross-presentation, which is a mechanism by which exogenously acquired-antigens are processed into MHC class I pathways, caused by the nanoparticle-mediated leakage of antigens into the cytosol after they have been taken up by the phagosome (part d); and the release of soluble mediators such as cytokines, chemokines and immunomodulatory molecules that regulate the immune response (not shown). APC, antigen-presenting cell; DC, dendritic cell; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TCR, T cell receptor. have been extensively characterized in animal models and are widely used in clinical applications as a matrix to encapsulate, co-deliver and gradually release active drugs 38 . In vaccine development, pegylated PLGA (150-200 nm in size) has been used to encapsulate hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and it promotes the rapid uptake and the endosomal localization of vaccine antigens in DCs, as well as the subsequent production of high titres of antigen-specific antibodies 39 . A thermosensitive biodegradable hydrogel consisting of the monomethoxy form of pegylated PLGA (less than 100 nm in size) has recently been used in mice to achieve the subcutaneous delivery of HBsAg at the injection site at the same time as the local and sustained release of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is a crucial cytokine for the survival, the differentiation and the maturation of DCs 40 . This vaccine enhanced the recruitment of DC precursor cells to the site of injection and promoted the maturation and the migration of CD11c + DCs to the local draining lymph nodes. This was followed by the strong induction of HBsAg-specific antibody and T cell responses, even in mice that do not normally generate immune responses against HBsAg or when low concentrations (\u22642 \u03bcg) of HBsAg were used. Importantly, this suggests that this adjuvant could potentially be used in vaccines that incorporate poorly immunogenic antigens or in vaccines for individuals who have an impaired immune system. The ability to protect antigens or other bioactive mediators, to maintain the native conformation of these components at the site of immune challenge and to create a depot effect with the gradual local release of antigens over time is a key advantage for these types of nanoparticles. Biodegradable nanoparticles have also been shown to be safe and biocompatible for use in vaccine technology 38 .",

The unique properties of certain microbial pathogens and VLPs have inspired and guided the systematic modelling, design and manufacture of novel nanoparticles that use combinations of both naturally occurring and synthetically engineered biostructural motifs to optimize immune responses to vaccine antigens. SAPNs constructed from different protein oligomerization domains have been designed to achieve repetitive antigen display 41 (FIG. 2) . A customized recombinant construct, which is expressed in Escherichia coli, encodes a single polypeptide chain with two different linked protein oligomerization domains, each containing particular coiled-coil heptad repeat patterns that drive the self assembly of the purified monomers into nanoparticles approximately 16 to 25 nm in diameter; these nanoparticles have icosahedral symmetry that is analogous to viral capsids. Thus, SAPNs provide a repeating scaffold structure to enable the conformational presentation of inserted protein epitopes or domains in a highly exposed configuration that protrudes or extends from the surface of the particle after the assembly of the subunits 41 . Approximately 180 peptide chains are assembled into a single nanoparticle to form this icosahedral structure. This geometry enables the manipulation of nearly all of the parameters described above as being necessary for VLPs: a scaffold for antigen display and cellular activation that leads to substantial increases in the specific production of high-titre, high-affinity antibodies directed against the inserted linear or conformational antigen epitopes 42 .",

The incorporation of trimeric coiled-coil epitopes from the surface protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) into SAPNs was shown to strongly induce the production of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies after the immunization of mice with these SAPNs 44 . In addition, the insertion of a tetrameric form of the immunogenic epitope from the external domain of the avian influenza virus matrix protein 2 (M2e) into SAPNs led to the high-density display of oligomeric epitopes in a native conformation and the subsequent reduction of H5N2 virus-shedding after the immunization of chickens with these SAPNs 45 . Furthermore, the integration of a tandem repeat of an immunodominant B cell epitope from the malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein (CSP) into SAPNs induced the production of T cell-dependent high-avidity antibodies in mice without the use of an adjuvant. This protected mice against both primary and long-term secondary challenges with live sporozoites without causing parasitaemia 46 . Interestingly, modification of the SAPN vaccine to incorporate both B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the CSP of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum induced the production of both high-titre antibodies and longlived polyfunctional interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3)-producing central memory T cells, which protected mice against a lethal dose of a transgenic P. berghei malaria parasite that expressed the CSP from P. falciparum 14 . Finally, the \u03b1-helical domain located in the membrane-proximal external region of HIV-1 gp41 was incorporated into a SAPN scaffold to recapitulate the epitopes recognized by pre-existing HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies; however, this approach was unsuccessful in inducing HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies in immunized rats 47 .

An example of a nanoemulsion is MF59, which consists of squalene oil in combination with polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) and sorbitan trioleate (Span 85). MF59 has been licensed in Europe as a clinical vaccine adjuvant for influenza and has been intramuscularly administered to tens of millions of healthy adults, elderly individuals and children 48 . The adjuvant activity seems to involve a combination of mechanisms, including an increased cellular uptake of antigens, an enhanced release of cytokines and chemokines, a recruitment of monocytes and granulocytes to the site of intramuscular injection, and an augmented maturation and upregulation of CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) by antigen-primed DCs, which promotes their migration to the draining lymph nodes 49, 50 . MF59 has been shown to be a more potent adjuvant than alum for inducing broadly protective humoral and T H 1-type cell-mediated immune responses 48, 51, 52 . Furthermore, with respect to vaccination against pandemic influenza viruses (for example, H5N1), M59 promotes protective antiviral immune responses when delivered with relatively low doses of virus-derived antigens. By contrast, the delivery of similar antigen doses in combination with alum results in variable or ineffective antiviral immunity 48, 53 . The clinical experience of using MF59 has been documented in these clinical studies as well as in post-marketing surveillance. Increased reactogenicity, including injection site pain, has been described following administration of MF59 and has been attributed to the increased inflammation that is associated with the enhanced immune response. The ratio of the increased reactogenicity to the benefit of increased immunity remains favourable, especially if enhanced responses are needed, as is the case with pandemic influenza vaccines 54 . Early-stage clinical trials are currently in progress to study the efficacy of MF59 as an adjuvant for vaccines against other viral pathogens, including herpes simplex virus, HBV and cytomegalovirus 48 . Intranasal administration of MF59 enhanced serum antibody responses in naive mice but not in pre-infected mice 55 or in humans 56 .",

The adjuvant activity of this nanoemulsion-antigen mixture is primarily dependent on the retention of a nanodroplet structure in the emulsion and on the positive charge that facilitates binding to negatively charged proteins such as mucin. The nanoscale size and positive \u03b6-potential of the emulsion enables the penetration of the mucous layer, the binding to cell membranes and the cellular uptake that together mediate the induction of the innate and the adaptive immune responses 58 . Cytokine secretion by ciliated epithelial cells in the nasal mucosa and by cells in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALT) is followed by the activation and the migration of antigen-primed DEC205 (also known as LY75) + DCs to the regional lymph nodes 59 . Interestingly, nanoemulsions have been shown to induce necrosis or apoptosis in epithelial cells and to simultaneously activate the surface expression of calreticulin, which is a signal for immunogenic cell death 60, 61 . These observations are consistent with a mechanism by which nanoemulsions rapidly facilitate the engulfment of dying antigenloaded epithelial cells by DCs and other phagocytic cells in the tissue 59 .

Fullerenes are globally produced in the order of hundreds of tonnes per year 85 . Spherical fullerenes are approximately 1 nm in diameter and can absorb electrons through the benzene rings on their surface, which enables them to function as scavengers for reactive oxygen species (ROS) 86 . When incubated with human mast cells and peripheral blood basophils, spherical fullerenes result in decreased IgE receptor-mediated signalling, decreased production of ROS and decreased degranulation. In a mouse model of anaphylaxis, fullerene treatment prevents histamine release and prevents the reduction in body temperature that normally occurs in mice after allergen challenge 87 .",

These structures can be formed as singlewalled or multi-walled tubes, both of which have been shown to have direct immunosuppressive effects. Mice exposed to single-walled CNTs by pharyngeal aspiration had increased levels of inflammation in the lungs and enhanced recruitment of DCs, alveolar macrophages, polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes. Interestingly, when cultured with stimulatory DCs, both the proliferation and the expansion of splenic T cell populations were decreased in animals that had been exposed to single-walled CNTs. In co-culture experiments, DCs that had been exposed to both lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and single-walled CNTs were less capable of promoting the proliferation and the expansion of T cell populations than DCs that had been exposed to LPS alone 88 . Although the mechanisms responsible for the effect of single-walled CNTs on DC function have not been fully elucidated, more is known about the mechanisms by which multi-walled CNTs affect T cell function. Animals exposed to inhaled multi-walled CNTs for several weeks showed no increase in pulmonary inflammation but they showed systemic immune suppression in the form of decreased T cell proliferation and a lower production of T cell-dependent antibodies 85 . The gene expression of the enzymes cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2; also known as PTGS2) and prostaglandin E synthase 2 (PTGES2) was upregulated in the spleens of multi-walled CNT-treated mice -a response that was abrogated by the administration of a cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) antagonist and in COX2-knockout mice. The overall immunosuppressive effect was shown to be mediated by transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) produced by alveolar macrophages 89 .",

Targeting of liposomes to specific cells is exemplified by the delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to DCs by surrounding the liposome that is carrying the siRNA with a monoclonal antibody that is specific to DCs. This gene-silencing approach was used to specifically target CD40 expression by DCs and resulted in reduced levels of T cell proliferation in the liposome-treated mice 111 .

            "text": "A final example of how nanotechnology can be applied to suppress an immune response is the use of nanoemulsions to deliver self antigens 114 . When the nanoemulsion W 80 5EC is combined with the self antigen thyroglobulin and is delivered to mice, the animals become tolerant to thyroglobulin; this response is characterized by a reduced humoral immune response to thyroglobulin, an upregulation of FOXP3 and TGF\u03b2 expression and increased T regulatory (T Reg ) cell activity. This is particularly interesting, as W 80 5EC administered with foreign antigens enhances immune responses by increasing antigen delivery as well as by increasing TLR2 and TLR4 activation 57, 115 . The signalling pathways that are activated after TLR4 stimulation include the myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88 (MYD88) and the TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF; also known as TICAM1) pathways, which result in the production and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines 116 . As too much inflammation is detrimental to the host 117 , the control of TLR4 stimulation is an important immunoregulatory function. Endotoxin tolerance is a mechanism by which immunosuppression occurs in the continued presence of LPS 118 . In addition, the immunoregulatory molecule TGF\u03b2 has been described as being increased in endotoxin tolerance, as well as in the aforementioned direct immunosuppressive effects of fullerenes 89 and in the indirect immunosuppressive effects of nanoemulsion delivery of self antigens 114 . Another similarity between the signalling mechanisms in nanotechnology-mediated immunosuppression and endotoxin tolerance is a relative increase in TRIF activation and a decrease in MYD88 activation 118 . This 'TRIF bias' has been described for particular TLR4 agonists such as MPL 119 , which is an LPS derivative that is used as an adjuvant in numerous vaccines, including licensed recombinant HPV bivalent vaccine 120 .",

In the future, the use of nanoparticles that have unique immunological properties determined by their size, shape, charge, porosity and hydrophobicity will enable researchers to 'customize' immune responses in new and unexpected ways. Improved protection against the outbreak of pandemic viruses and other emerging or mutating pathogens will require the rapid activation of innate and adaptive immune responses, ideally within hours (for an innate immune response) or days (for an adaptive immune response) after a single priming dose of vaccine. This could be achieved through the absorption of nanoparticles that have unique combinations of antigens and cytokines. It is also possible that passive immunity through nanoparticle-delivered immunoglobulin genes could produce antibodies specific for pathogens and could provide immune replacement rather than simply immune manipulation by nanotechnology.",

Nanoparticles could be surrounded by antigens to augment CTL activity or they could be combined with immunomodulators, including cytokines such as GM-CSF, IL-12, IL-15 and FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L). As many co-stimulatory ligands are now known, multimerizing CD40 ligand (CD40L), glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (GITR; also known as TNFRSF18) or other activating and blocking ligands could turn lymphocytes on and off with greater precision than the antibodies that are currently being used to help to control autoimmunity and immune responses to allergens or even to transplanted organs. Using antigens with NOD-like receptors, TLR ligands and other microbial pattern recognition systems could induce CTL responses to antigens that normally do not produce this activity. It is also possible that 'suppressive nanoparticles' could be given to relatives of patients with specific autoimmune diseases in order to prevent disease development. Genetic screening for many immune diseases might enable the early correction of some immune defects using nanoparticle gene delivery methods rather than bone marrow transplantation.",

These emerging nanotechnologies provide new ways to interrogate complex pathways that control the differentiation of immune cells, including the balance of T H 17 and T Reg cells. This approach might also enable the future design of more effective therapeutics to regulate the immune system and to potentially reduce side effects and inflammation.",

Direct effects include the upregulation of homing receptors such as CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and co-stimulatory molecules including CD40, CD80 and CD86, which results in the enhanced secretion of cytokines and increased B cell and T cell activation. Enhanced delivery of antigens and adjuvants might result in apoptosis or necrosis, which enhances vaccine immunogenicity. The pathways shown are representative examples of how different nanoparticles might activate the immune system.

Nanoscale products might have a direct immunosuppressive effect (part a) on components of the immune response, including antigen presenting cells (APCs), B cells or T cells; they might deliver compounds that result in immunosuppression (part b); or they might use both mechanisms at the same time. Direct effects include the upregulation of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), which results in increased cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), prostangandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), and decreased B cell and T cell activity, as well as apoptosis. The delivery of immunosuppressants results in a decreased response to IL-2 with sirolimus, the downregulation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) with steroids and the upregulation of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), which results in increased regulatory T cell (T Reg ) activity when self antigens are presented in a nanoemulsion.

This Phase IIa clinical trial shows both the advantages and the potential limitations of using an improved MelQbG10 virus-like nanoparticle (30 nm) vaccine displaying MART1 on the surface together with integrated and exogenous TLR agonists for the enhanced generation of T H 1 cell responses and effector or memory CD8 + T cell activation in late stage cancer patients. 6. Manolova, V. et al. Nanoparticles target distinct dendritic cell populations according to their size. Eur. J. Immunol. 38, 1404-1413 (2008). This paper shows that polystyrene nanoparticles of a defined size (20-200 nm), or VLPs (30 nm) biodistribute rapidly to the draining lymph nodes to be taken up by lymph node resident DCs, whereas larger nanoparticles (500-2,000 nm) are acquired by DCs at the site of injection to be subsequently transported to the lymphatic tissues. This establishes nanoscale size as a crucial parameter for the mechanism of biodistribution and delivery and for vaccine applications. 7. Reddy, S. T. et al. Exploiting lymphatic transport and complement activation in nanoparticle vaccines. Nature Biotech. 25, 1159-1164 (2007).
