            "text": "Infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs) of GI-13 (793/B) and GI-19 (QX/LX4) lineages have been frequently detected in China in recent years. Naturally recombinant IBVs originating from the GI-13 and GI-19 lineages have also been isolated from chicken flocks with respiratory and renal problems in China. Thorough genetic and biological investigations of these recombinant viruses have led to speculation regarding their origin, evolution, and control. In order to confirm the previous results and further extend our understanding about the characteristics of the four recombinant IBV strains we had previously identified (I0718/17, I0722/17, I0724/17, and I0737/17), we conducted phylogenetic analysis by comparing their complete S1 gene sequences with those of 71 reference strains of different genotypes and lineages. We identified a close relationship between the S1 sequences of the four strains and those of GI-13 strains. The results of complete genome sequence analysis confirmed the previously identified recombination events in the four IBV strains and revealed additional recombination events in different genomic regions of strains I0718/17 and I0724/17, suggesting that the two strains originated from multiple recombination events between 4/91-like and YX10-like viruses. We comparatively evaluated the antigenicity, pathogenicity, and affinity of the four recombinant viruses and their deduced parental strains in the trachea and kidneys. Some of the strains showed comparable antigenic relatedness, pathogenicity, and affinity for the trachea and kidneys among each other and with their parental viruses; however, some of them showed varying biological characteristics. Point mutations observed in the receptor-binding domain and hypervariable region of the S1 subunit of the spike protein likely have an effect on these differences in biological characteristics, although the influence of other factors-such as host innate-immune responses and changes in genomic regions beyond the S1 protein-might also be responsible for such changes.",

            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute and highly contagious disease caused by the IB virus (IBV), which causes respiratory diseases, interstitial nephritis, and reproductive disorders in chickens of all ages (Cavanagh, 2007) . The disease can induce severe economic losses, especially in terms of decreased egg production, poor eggshell quality, reduced hatchability, increased feed conversion, and carcass condemnation at slaughterhouses (Santos Fernando et al., 2017) . IBV variants are continuously emerging in different regions of the world and continue to be a major problem for chicken production worldwide (Jackwood, 2012) . Vaccination is considered to be the most reliable approach for IBV control; however, existing vaccines have proved to be inadequate due to the constant emergence of new virus variants (De Wit, 2000; de Wit et al., 2011) . In addition, co-infection of a chicken by different IBV types carry the risk of recombination, accounting for the emergence of novel IBV strains with different antigenic properties, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity; such strains have been identified in many parts of the world (Franzo et al., 2015; Hewson et al., 2014; Hong et al., 2012; Kottier et al., 1995; Lee and Jackwood, 2000; Mardani et al., 2010; Naguib et al., 2016; Quinteros et al., 2016; Pohuang et al., 2011; Thor et al., 2011; Zanaty et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015) , and this presents a major challenge to current IBV prevention and control strategies.",

The S protein, especially the S1 subunit formed by post-translational cleavage, is critical for antigenic neutralization, hemagglutination, and determining cell tropism (Casais et al., 2001; Cavanagh, 2007; 1988; 1997; Kant et al., 1992; Promkuntod et al., 2014) . The high mutation rate of the S1 gene during IBV replication and evolution generates extensive genotypic, antigenic, and pathogenic variability in the progeny viruses. This implies the existence of multiple genotypes/serotypes and variants, against which the existing IB vaccines might not offer complete crossprotection (Cavanagh et al., 1997; Gelb et al., 2005) , thus hampering the control of IBV infection by vaccination.",

These variants have been proved to be distinct from other reference strains on the basis of genetic characteristics and phylogenetic differences in the S1 gene (Xu et al., 2018) . To provide a comprehensive outlook on the genetic characteristics of these IBV variants, we sequenced and comparatively analyzed the complete genome sequences of four novel IBV variants with those of other IBV strains in the present study. We also characterized the antigenicity, pathogenicity, and tissue tropism of these IBV strains and looked for possible associations between their genes and their phenotypic properties.",

The results demonstrated that our four IBV strains were phylogenetically clustered among IBV strains with the GI-13 genotype (Valastro et al., 2016) , including the 4/91 vaccine strain and Moroccan/G/83 (El-Houadfi et al., 1986) .

The majority of variations between I0737/17 and 4/91 were observed at the far N terminus of the S1 subunit of the S protein, in which three substitutions were located in HVRI. The nucleotide sequence of this region in strain I0737/17 was same as those in strains LGX/100508 and YX10. In contrast, the nucleotide sequences of the remaining regions in I0737/17 were nearly the same as those in strain 4/91 and different from those in strains LGX/100508 and YX10. These remaining regions included several important domains, such as the deduced minimal RBD, most parts of HVRI, all parts of HVRs II and III, and the five epitopes mapped to the S1 subunit of the S protein (Kusters et al., 1989; Koch et al., 1990) . Strains I0718/17, I0722/17, and I0724/17 possessed similar nucleotide sequences and showed differences with the amino acid sequence of 4/ 91 at the N terminus of the S1 subunit, which included HVRs I and II, epitopes D and E, half of the RBD, and four critical amino acids in the RBD.

It also helps address the processes of virus maintenance and circulation in chicken flocks. We, therefore, studied the genetic characteristics of four IBV isolates by analyzing their full-length genome sequences and also evaluated their persistence and biological properties. It has been reported that the side effects of the 4/91 vaccine might provide the basis for recombination with other strains. This phenomenon has been shown by several studies which have traced the emergence of many novel IBV strains to recombination events between the 4/91 vaccine and field strains (Feng et al., 2018; Han et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017 Jiang et al., , 2018 Liu et al., 2013; Mo et al., 2013; Ovchinnikova et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015 Zhang et al., , 2016 Zhou et al., 2017) in cases where the 4/91 vaccine strain could not provide effective protection against the field strains , leading to coinfection of the vaccine and field strains in the same chickens and ultimately resulting in recombination. In this study, we performed complete genome sequence analysis of strains I0718/17, I0722/17, I0724/17, and I0737/17 and confirmed the occurrence of recombination events at the 5\u2032 ends of the S1 gene between a 4/91-like virus (GI-13 lineage) and a YX10-like virus (GI-19) (Xu et al., 2018) , which contributed to the emergence of the IBV strains. In addition, we also identified recombination \"hotspots\" in other regions of the genome in strains I0718/17 and I0724/17. We, therefore, speculate that these two strains originated from multiple recombination events between 4/91-like and YX10-like IBV strains.",

            "text": "A potential concern regarding these recombination events is that the changes occurring in the S1 subunit during recombination have altered the neutralizing epitopes, resulting in the emergence of novel IBV serotypes. The S1 subunit of the S protein contains HVRs associated with serotype-specific and virus-neutralizing epitopes; these HVRs are present within amino acid residues 38-67, 91-141, and 274-387 (Wang and Huang, 2000) . In the present study, strains I0718/17, I0722/17, and I0724/17 were found to show a significant clustering of substitutions in HVRs I and II and epitopes D and E in comparison with 4/91 strain; these strains also showed such significant clustering of substitutions in the remaining regions of the S1 domain-including HVR III and epitopes B/C/A-in comparison with strains YX10 and LGX/ 100508 (which differ by only two amino acids in the S1 region). These regions have previously been identified as the most variable genomic regions among different IBV serotypes (Cavanagh, 2007) , and point mutations in these regions might have an effect on protein structure and polarity, possibly leading to changes in protein antigenicity. Such point mutations might also account for the decreased cross-neutralization activity between the two deduced parental strains (4/91 and LGX/ 100508) and the novel IBV strains evaluated in this study (I0718/17, I0722/17, and I0724/17), as evident from the absence of antigenic relatedness between the two groups. Upon comparing the r values between strains I0718/17, I0722/17, and I0724/17, we found that strain I0718/17 is serologically related to I0724/17. However, it was surprising to find that the other IBV pairs are not serologically related to each other, although the three viruses have very similar S1 gene sequences. IBV strains differing only by a few amino acid substitutions have been reported to show variations in antigenicity (Abdel-Moneim Table 1 Comparison of putative genes/genomic regions between the four novel IBV strains and two reference strains (4/91 and YX10). et al., 2006) . However, strains I0722 and I0724/17 have identical S1 gene sequences. Similarly, we found a difference of only ten substitutions between strains I0737/17 and 4/91, nine of which were located at the N terminus of the S1 subunit (with only three being located in HVR I). The r value calculated from the cross-neutralization test was less than 50, which implied that strain I0737/17 is not serologically related to 4/91. Contrary to this result, we have previously demonstrated that replacing the three HVRs of the avirulent Beaudette strain of IBV separately or simultaneously with the corresponding regions from a GI-19-lineage nephropathogenic strain by reverse genetics does not produce any changes in the serotype of the Beaudette strain (Shan et al., 2018) . These results might suggest that the amino acid sequences of the HVRs were not the only factor accounting for the variations in antigenicity of IBVs. Another potential concern regarding recombination events between vaccine and field strains is that recombination events leading to reversion to virulence might produce nephropathogenic and highly pathogenic recombinant strains. In the present study, all four IBV strains were pathogenic in comparison with the 4/91 vaccine strain, although they showed varying levels of pathogenicity in SPF chickens. Some of the strains showed a comparable affinity for replication in the kidneys as the LGX/100508 strain. Coronavirus binding and entry into susceptible host cells requires interactions between cell-surface receptors and the viral attachment protein (S protein). As in other coronaviruses, the S1 subunit of the S protein of IBV contains an RBD (Koch et al., 1990; Schultze et al., 1992; Spaan et al., 1988; Sturman et al., 1985) . The location of the RBD in IBV genome has been mapped to the most N-terminal 19-272 amino acid residues of the S1 subunit (Promkuntod et al., 2014) . Moreover, amino acids N38, H43, P63, and T69 appear to be critical for the binding of the S protein to host cells in the chicken respiratory tract (Promkuntod et al., 2014) . In the present study, although strains I0737/17 and 4/91 showed a difference of ten amino acid substitutions, only four were found to be located in the RBD domain. Moreover, when tested by means of experimental infection in SPF birds, these two viruses showed no drastic differences in their affinity for replication in the trachea or their pathogenicity. Although the C-terminal sequences of the RBD of strains I0718/17, I0722/17, and I0724/17 differed greatly from that of strain LGX/100508, all these viruses showed a similar affinity for replication in the trachea of infected chickens. These results suggest that these sequence exchanges might have no effect on the affinity of the viruses for the trachea, particularly for interaction with \u03b1-2,3-sialic acid or other potential IBV receptors on the surface of cells in the respiratory tract of chickens (Shahwan et al., 2013; Winter et al., 2006) . However, strain LGX/ 100508 was more pathogenic to SPF chickens than the other strains analyzed in the present study. Therefore, the point mutations observed in the RBD might have an effect on the affinity of the viruses for different tissues, rendering them highly pathogenic to SPF chickens. Interestingly, although strain I0718/17 differed from strains I0722/17 and I0724/17 by only six amino acid substitutions in the S1 protein, it showed a higher affinity for kidneys and was more pathogenic to SPF chickens. This indicates that these amino acid changes might affect receptor binding. Otherwise, the S1 protein of these IBV strains might not be the only factor responsible for their expression of pathogenicity. The binding of susceptible host cells is the first step in the viral life cycle, and host innate immune responses could also be a major contributing factor to the pathological outcome of IBV infection. In addition, we cannot exclude that the differences in pathogenicity are not due to other changes between the parental 4/91 strain and the recombinant viruses. By using reverse genetics, a previous report showed that the replicase gene of IBV is a determinant of pathogenicity (Armesto et al., 2009) and recent studies have shown that IBV pathogenicity is also due to the accessory proteins (Laconi et al., 2018; van Beurden et al., 2018) . In order to establish the mechanisms, further study by reverse genetics and animal studies is needed to verify the association between changes in the genome sequence and the pathogenicity of IBV strains. While all IBV strains appear to initially infect chickens through the respiratory tract, viremia enables the viruses to spread to secondary sites for further replication and persistence. It has been considered that the IBV strain replicates mainly in the respiratory tract, although it can also spread and replicate in a range of other tissues, such as the digestive and urogenital tracts. In this study, we found that IBV-infected birds shed the virus for a longer duration from the cloaca than from the respiratory tract; moreover, the birds shed the virus from the respiratory tract even after the clinical signs had disappeared. It is important to consider that, during an active IBV infection, even in the absence of clinical disease, and during the course of chronic and persistent infection, the gastrointestinal tract contains a significant amount of virus, and such persistently infected tissues are a likely source of reinfection in chickens, as reported previously Gough, 1978, 1977; Chong and Apostolov, 1982; Cook, 1968; Jones and Ambali, 1987) . In addition, our results from analysis of oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs showed that most of the challenged birds shed their challenge viruses from the digestive tract at 20 dpc, by which time the birds were positive for anti-IBV antibodies. This suggests that these IBVs had reached a somewhat persistent status despite the presence of systemic anti-IBV immunoglobulin G. Thus, these anti-IBV antibodies present in the serum seem to exert a non-complete protective role against IBV infection in SPF chickens, as reported previously (Santos Fernando et al., 2017) .",
