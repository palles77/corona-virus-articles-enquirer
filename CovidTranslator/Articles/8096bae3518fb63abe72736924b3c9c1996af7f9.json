Therefore, they can be anticipated, and to the extent that unsafe infectionprone practices can be identified and modified, they can be systematically prevented. Another common feature is that many of the occupational infectious diseases can be regarded as behavioral. To the extent that unsafe practices have been defined, and practice policies modified to reduce infection risk, continued transmission often represents failure to follow accepted standards. Although certain occupational infections can be prevented by vaccines (e.g., hepatitis B), prevention often depends on simple behavioral changes, such as hand hygiene, use of gloves, and not working while ill. Finally, the anthrax cases during the fall of 2001 in the United States demonstrate the possibility of intentional (and criminal) exposure to infectious agents in the workplace, in this instance among those handling mail. 1 These intentional exposures, fortunately, are rare events, but should be considered in assessing sources of exposure for unexpected illnesses.",

Modernization of agrarian techniques and improvement in sanitation have markedly decreased the incidence of these infections in the developed world, though they remain problematic in developing countries. While nearly all infectious diseases could conceivably be transmitted in the workplace, the emphasis here is on those that can be transmitted by casual contact or by specific workrelated exposures, with emphasis on diseases that are most common, most serious, or most readily prevented. Healthcare settings pose a unique challenge because of the proximity of infectious patients, susceptible patients, and healthcare personnel. Infections transmitted from personnel may have devastating effects on certain groups of patients, particularly the immunosuppressed. Likewise, certain infections transmitted to personnel, such as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, may have serious or even fatal, consequences. Table 22 .1 summarizes the microbial etiology, sources, routes of infection, categories of workers at risk, and clinical manifestations of selected infectious diseases that have occupational predilections. A detailed discussion of waterborne microbial diseases is also provided in Chapter 54. Because the treatment of occupationally acquired infections does not differ from that of infections acquired non-occupationally, 2 the emphasis of this chapter is on the recognition and prevention of these infections. etiologic category, as well as the potential for recurrences, account for the high incidence of the common cold, even among healthy adults. Colds are more common in the fall, winter, and early spring, perhaps because of increased crowding among children during the colder seasons. Workers are most apt to acquire colds from exposure to young children in the home. Secondary cases among coworkers may then develop. Adults experience two to four colds each year, although the incidence among adult women exceeds that of men by a small margin, and smokers have a substantially increased risk.",

Many pathogens, including influenza, RSV, and parainfluenza, cause outbreaks in a seasonal pattern. Laboratory confirmatory tests can be performed to differentiate influenza from other illnesses. Appropriate patient samples to collect for laboratory testing can include a nasopharyngeal or throat swab from adults, or nasal wash or nasal aspirates, depending on which rapid test is used. Samples should be collected within the first 4 days of illness. Rapid influenza tests provide results within 24 hours; viral culture provides results in 3-10 days. Most of the rapid tests are more than 70% sensitive for detecting influenza and more than 90% specific. Because as many as 30% of samples that would be positive for influenza by viral culture may give a negative rapid test result, negative rapid tests should be followed by viral culture in a sample of the swabs collected.

An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the body are affected. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. About 50% of adults, however, have been previously infected with parvovirus B19, have developed immunity to the virus, and cannot get fifth disease. Fifth disease is believed to be spread through direct contact, fomites, or large droplets. The period of infectivity is before the onset of the rash.

            "text": "Epidemiology Pertussis, or whooping cough, is an acute infectious disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Pertussis continues to be an important cause of mortality in the United States. A dramatic decline in the incidence followed the widespread use of whole-cell pertussis vaccines in the mid-1940s. However, since the early 1980s, the reported pertussis incidence has increased cyclically with peaks occurring every 3-4 years. 7, 8 Contributing to this increase in incidence is the waning of immunity over time following vaccination, particularly in older age groups. Transmission most commonly occurs by contact with respiratory secretions or large aerosol droplets from the respiratory tracts of infected persons and less frequently by contact with freshly contaminated articles of an infected person. Analysis of national surveillance data for pertussis during 1997-2000 indicates that pertussis incidence continues to increase in infants too young to receive three doses of pertussis-containing vaccine and in adolescents and adults. 7 Clinical syndromes The incubation period of pertussis is commonly 7-10 days. Pertussis begins insidiously with non-specific upper respiratory symptoms including coryza, sneezing, low-grade fever, and a mild, occasional cough, similar to the common cold. The cough gradually becomes more severe, and after 1-2 weeks, the second, or paroxysmal stage, begins. Characteristically, the patient has paroxysms of numerous, rapid coughs generally with a characteristic high-pitched whoop, commonly followed by vomiting and exhaustion. The patient usually appears normal between attacks. Older persons (i.e., adolescents and adults), and those partially protected by the vaccine may become infected with B. pertussis, but usually have milder atypical disease. Pertussis in these persons may present as a more persistent cough of greater than 7 days duration, and may be indistinguishable from other upper respiratory infections. Inspiratory whoop is uncommon. B. pertussis is estimated to account for up to 7% of cough illnesses per year in older persons. Even though the disease may be milder in older persons, these infected persons may transmit the disease to other susceptible persons, including unimmunized or underimmunized infants.",

Vaccine reactions are thought to be more frequent in older age groups, and pertussis-associated morbidity and mortality decrease with increasing age. Studies are currently under way to determine if a booster dose of acellular pertussis vaccine administered to older children or adults may reduce the risk of infection with B. pertussis. This may in turn reduce the risk of transmission of B. pertussis to infants and young children who may be incompletely vaccinated. Studies among older children, adolescents, and adults examining pertussis disease burden and transmission of disease to infants might guide future policy decisions on the use of acellular pertussis vaccines among persons more than seven years of age. Currently, vaccination of children more than 7 years of age, adolescents, and adults is not recommended either routinely or as an outbreak control measure. In the future, licensure of pertussis vaccines for adolescents or adults may lead to new recommendations for the use of vaccines in outbreaks. 9",

The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in the United States declined steadily until the mid-1980s, but then sharply increased, especially in urban areas. The resurgence of TB in the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s was associated with the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. With this resurgence of TB in the United States came several high-profile nosocomial outbreaks associated with lapses in infection control practices and delays in diagnosis and treatment of persons with infectious TB, as well as the appearance and transmission of MDR-TB strains. Since 1992, the declines in the overall number of reported TB cases, including the level of MDR-TB, appear to reflect successful efforts to strengthen TB control following the resurgence of TB and the emergence of MDR-TB. 12 Activities emphasizing the first priority of TB control (i.e., promptly identifying persons with TB, initiating appropriate therapy, and ensuring completion of therapy) have been the most important factors in achieving this improvement. Such activities reduced community transmission of M. tuberculosis, particularly in areas with a high incidence of AIDS. Improvements in implementation of infection control measures in healthcare settings, concurrent with mobilization of the nation's TB control programs, succeeded in reversing the upsurge in reported cases of TB, and case rates have declined to their lowest levels to date.

Despite its shortcomings, and because of its beneficial effect in children and against leprosy, BCG vaccine likely will remain a component of childhood vaccination strategies in developing countries. However, because of questions about the vaccine's efficacy, and because it induces dermal hypersensitivity to purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin in most recipients, BCG has never been recommended for programmatic use in the United States. 14 Healthcare providers should follow appropriate infection control procedures, including use of isolation rooms and respiratory protection, when caring for patients with active tuberculosis. 15, 16 Varicella/zoster Epidemiology Varicella virus, the causative agent of chickenpox and zoster, is a highly contagious herpes virus spread by the respiratory route from person to person. The incubation period is about 14 days, and the period of infectivity begins a few days prior to the onset of the rash to about 6 days after the first crop of vesicles appears. Immunosuppression usually prolongs the period of infectivity, especially if varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) has been administered. Zoster represents reactivation of varicella virus that is latent in sensory nerve ganglia, and it is not a manifestation of primary infection except in newborns infected in utero. The incidence of zoster increases with age and immunosuppression. Susceptible persons in direct contact with zoster lesions risk developing primary varicella.",

Varicella is not a nationally notifiable disease, and surveillance data are limited. 17 Clinical syndromes Varicella in otherwise healthy children usually is a benign, self-limited disease characterized by low-grade fever and vesicular rash, often preceded by a viral prodrome. Varicella vesicles of primary infection appear first on the scalp and trunk and disseminate in crops showing various stages of development over the next 3-4 days. Healing results in crusting accompanied by intense pruritus. Manifestations of varicella are more severe in adults than in children. About 15% of adults with varicella show radiographic evidence of pulmonary involvement, but this is rarely clinically significant. However, cough, tachypnea, and impaired gas exchange can occur and persist for months after infection. Varicella during pregnancy can produce congenital varicella. In its most severe form, this infection can result in mental retardation, blindness, growth retardation, deafness, chorioretinitis, and a peculiar dermatomal lesion of the upper or lower extremity associated with limb atrophy.",

Antiviral drugs have not been shown to decrease transmission of varicella, reduce the duration of absence from school, or reduce complications. Oral acyclovir can be considered in otherwise healthy adolescents and adults or secondary cases in the household, because of the increased risk of severe illness in these groups. Antiviral therapy may also be considered for persons with chronic cutaneous or pulmonary disorders, persons receiving long-term salicylate therapy, and for children receiving short, intermittent or aerosolized courses of corticosteroids.

Live attenuated virus vaccines have demonstrated efficacy in preventing primary infection, and one was licensed for use in the United States in 1995. Routine immunization is now recommended for children less than 18 months of age. 17 Varicella vaccination should be given to susceptible adolescents and adults who are at high risk of exposure to varicella. This group includes persons who live or work in environments in which there is a high likelihood of transmission of varicella, such as teachers of young children, residents and staff in institutional settings, and military personnel. Varicella vaccination is also recommended for susceptible adolescents and adults who will have close contact with persons at high risk for serious complications of acquired varicella, including healthcare personnel and susceptible family contacts of immunocompromised individuals. The ACIP recommends that all healthcare personnel be immune to varicella, either from a reliable history of prior varicella infection or vaccination, to reduce the risk of infection and its complications, and to decrease the possibility of transmission of varicella zoster virus to patients (Table 22. 3). Susceptible adults exposed to children with varicella or with disseminated zoster pose a risk of transmitting varicella to non-immune coworkers, and they should not work until the incubation period is over or, if they become ill, until all lesions are crusted (Table 22. 2). Dermatomal zoster is not spread efficiently by the air-borne route and otherwise healthy adults afflicted with this illness may be allowed to work if they can avoid touching the lesions and contaminating the work environment. The role of vaccine in the postexposure management of susceptible employees needs to be elucidated. Data from the United States and Japan in a variety of settings indicate that varicella vaccine is effective in preventing illness or modifying the severity of illness if used within 3 days, and possibly up to 5 days, of exposure. ACIP recommends vaccine be used in susceptible persons following exposure to varicella. 17 Personnel should be excluded from work who have onset of varicella until all lesions have dried and crusted (Table 22. 2).",

Most of the etiologic agents are acquired by the fecal-oral route; produce mild, self-limited diseases; and resolve without specific therapy. Agents of dysentery (e.g., Shigella spp.) often are highly transmissible through low-inoculum exposures. Occupational transmission of food-borne or water-borne illnesses occurs; person-to-person transmission has propagated outbreaks of many of these illnesses in healthcare settings, daycare and nursery schools, and institutions where sanitation is poor. Instances of such transmission have generally involved food handlers, who are often poorly trained and short-term employees, serving as sources of transmission to others.

HCV RNA can be detected within 1-2 weeks of exposure to the virus and several weeks before elevations of ALT and detection of anti-HCV. Testing for anti-HCV by EIA is recommended 4-6 months after an exposure to detect infection; testing for HCV RNA may be performed 4-6 weeks after exposure if earlier detection of infection is desired. 23 Treatment, prevention, and control HCV-positive patients should be evaluated for the presence and severity of chronic liver disease. Initial evaluation for presence of disease should include multiple measurements of ALT at regular intervals, because ALT activity fluctuates in persons with chronic hepatitis C. Patients with chronic hepatitis C should be evaluated for severity of their liver disease and for possible treatment.

Available data suggest that an established infection might need to be present before interferon can be an effective treatment. 23, 29 Because there is currently no postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HCV, the intent of recommendations for postexposure management is to achieve early identification of infection and, if present, referral for evaluation of treatment options. In addition, no guidelines exist for administration of therapy during the acute phase of HCV infection. However, limited data indicate that antiviral therapy might be beneficial when started early in the course of HCV infection. When HCV infection is identified early, the person should be referred for medical management to a specialist knowledgeable in this area. 23 At present, avoidance of parenteral exposure to blood is the only available strategy for preventing HCV infection.",

The virus also is perinatally transmitted to approximately 20-40% of children born to infected mothers, (e.g., vertical transmission). Breastfeeding is a bidirectional mode of transmission, to nursing infants of infected mothers and, rarely, to mothers of nursing infants when nipple maceration and biting occur. Since 1985, all donated blood in the United States has been screened for HIV infection. The risk of HIV infection due to transfusion of blood products screened by current methods is estimated to be 1 in 1,900,000 units transfused. 32 Screening does not completely eliminate the potential for a seronegative but infected unit from a recently infected donor to escape detection.",

The other group of workers at risk for acquiring HIV infection occupationally is healthcare personnel. Healthcare providers and other workers in contact with blood or other body fluids who sustain accidental percutaneous or mucosal inoculations with virus-infected material are at risk for infection. The magnitude of risk depends on the severity of exposure, but on the average, about 1 in 300 HIV needlesticks results in infection. The risk for infection following mucosal exposures is estimated to be lower at approximately 0.09%. In the absence of direct exposure, healthcare providers are not at occupational risk for HIV infection. In the United States, through December 2002, there have been 57 cases of occupationally acquired HIV infection reported with an additional 139 possible cases. 32 Clinical syndromes The clinical course of HIV infection is variable and changing with the advent of antiretroviral therapy, as well as treatment and prophylaxis for infectious complications. Early after infection, within a few weeks to months, an acute febrile illness characterized by malaise, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, maculopapular rash, and headache may occur. The frequency of this mononucleosis-like illness has varied widely in reports of seroconverting individuals. At initial presentation of such patients, HIV antibody screening tests (enzyme immunoassay (EIA)) may be negative, but viral antigen (p24 antigen) and serologic reactivity to one or more viral components (Western blot test) allows the diagnosis to be established at this stage. HIV infection should be suspected in any person with a mononucleosis syndrome lacking a positive heterophil antibody response (monospot test).",

Information regarding treatment of acute HIV infection from clinical trials is very limited. Ongoing clinical trials are addressing the question of the long-term clinical benefit of potent treatment regimens for primary infection. In general, treatment should be offered to individuals with fewer than 350 CD4 T cells/mm or plasma HIV RNA levels exceeding 55,000 copies/rnL (by RT-PCR or bDNA assay). Once the decision has been made to initiate antiretroviral therapy, the goals should be maximal and durable suppression of viral load, restoration and/or preservation of immunologic function, improvement of quality of life, and reduction of HIVrelated morbidity and mortality. 33 HIV-infected individuals found to have latent TB infection should be treated with antituberculous therapy to prevent activation of disease. 13 Persons at risk for direct contact with blood and other potentially infected materials should receive specific instruction in universal/standard precautions for infection control, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 34, 35 and mandated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 27 For most environments outside healthcare settings, common sense and attention to personal hygiene are adequate to protect workers. Gloves should be worn to clean up visible sites of blood contamination. Environmental surfaces can then be decontaminated with disinfectant solutions or household bleach (diluted 1:100). 34, 36 Individuals sustaining accidental parenteral exposures to HIV should be counseled to undergo baseline and followup testing for 6 months after exposure (e.g., 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months) to diagnose occupational infection. Postexposure chemoprophylaxis with antiretroviral agents has been recommended by the US Public Health Service since 1996 after certain exposures to HIV-infected sources which pose a risk of infection transmission, such as needlesticks, mucous membrane, and non-intact skin exposures (Tables 22.5 and 22.6). Data from animal models of prophylaxis with these agents suggest that antiviral activity is diminished when treatment is delayed for more than 24 hours. For this reason, immediate reporting and access to chemoprophylaxis is recommended. Occupational exposure is a frightening experience. Consultation with clinicians knowledgeable about HIV transmission risks who can provide supportive counseling to the worker is essential during the follow-up interval. CDC recommends that occupationally exposed workers refrain from unsafe sexual practices, pregnancy, and blood and organ donation for 6 months after exposure to minimize the risk of transmission.",

In work environments where exposure to M. tuberculosis may occur -such as healthcare settings, residential care facilities, shelters, and correctional facilities -active TST surveillance among susceptible individuals is indicated. Periodic TSTs are especially important in the wake of several recent outbreaks associated with drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis in hospitals, adult care settings, and home healthcare settings. 16 Skin testing should be performed at least annually in these settings, and perhaps as often as every 6 months, for personnel at high risk for exposure to active TB. Surveillance of teachers, travelers to endemic areas, and employees in other institutional settings where close contact with infected individuals is possible also may be warranted, depending on the local prevalence of TB. 14 Surveillance for infections among laboratory workers and animal handlers exposed to specific pathogens should be individualized in accordance with standard guidelines for biosafety in microbiologic and biomedical laboratories. 47 Maintaining standardized records of reportable infectious diseases is an important component of passive surveillance in the workplace. Centralized collection and assessment of these records at regular intervals may allow early detection of outbreaks of occupational infections amenable to specific control interventions. Geographic or temporal clusters of cases or clustering among persons with similar attributes or occupational tasks suggest a common source of exposure and infection and warrant investigation. Local public health officials and regulatory agencies should be consulted promptly when an outbreak is initially suspected. Reporting of occupationally acquired infections permits public health agencies to identify clusters of old and emerging illnesses and ultimately prevent them. These events should be reported as mandated by state and local regulations. 48, 49 Return-to-work criteria Employees diagnosed with communicable infectious diseases should not return to work until the period of infectivity is past. Specific guidelines should be consistent with local public health regulations. Some workers, for example food handlers with certain diarrheal illnesses, cannot resume their duties until culture evidence of cure is obtained. Employees should be advised of the return-towork policies at the time of employment and when illness is diagnosed. A table for length of work restriction for healthcare personnel can be used to guide return-to-work policies for the workplace (Table 22. 2). 19",

However, the re-emergence of epidemic and MDR-TB has led to a re-emphasis of other fundamentals for prevention of transmission of tuberculosis in healthcare and other settings. Early identification of TB allows early indication for therapy, and requires alertness in considering TB in high-risk patients with pulmonary symptoms, especially those with HIV infection. Special ventilation measures and respiratory protection are especially important for cough-inducing procedures, such as sputum induction and aerosolized pentamidine administration. Healthcare personnel who have the potential for being exposed to M. tuberculosis should be screened on employment and at least annually thereafter by PPD skin testing, comparing previous test results to current results to identify those who have converted to skin test positivity. 15 Procedures for disposal of infectious wastes have been developed by the CDC. 36 Needles and other sharp objects should be sterilized prior to disposal. Liquid and laboratory wastes may be dumped into sewage systems. Materials heavily contaminated with bacteria or blood should be placed in special bags that are specifically labeled for infectious waste and should be disposed of according to community standards for such materials. 36 Employers have a responsibility to educate employees about infection control.

Many of these infections are preventable by policies that promote hygiene and provide exclusion from work during periods of contagion. In addition, a variety of less common, but sometimes serious, infections are particularly associated with specific occupations. Recognition of the types of infection risk associated with specific occupations can, in most cases, lead to effective, often simple steps for primary prevention, as well as opportunities for early diagnosis and treatment.",
