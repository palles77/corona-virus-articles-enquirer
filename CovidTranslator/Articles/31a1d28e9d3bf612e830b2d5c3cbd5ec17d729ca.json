            "text": "The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in the haemocytes of shrimps Fenneropenaeus chinensis (Osbeck) and Marsupenaeus japonicus (Bate) was studied after white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection to determine its characteristics in response to virus infection. First, the NOS activity in haemocytes of shrimps was determined by the means of NBT reduction and changes in cell conformation. And the variations of NOS activity in shrimps after challenge with WSSV intramuscularly were evaluated through the analysis of L-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate (both as NO derivates) concentrations. The result showed that NOS activity in the haemocytes of F. chinensis increased slightly from 0 to 12 h postchallenge, indicated by the variations of L-citrulline (from 11.15 \u00a7 0.10 to 12.08 \u00a7 0.64 M) and total nitrite/nitrate concentrations (from 10.45 \u00a7 0.65 to 12.67 \u00a7 0.52 M). Then it decreased sharply till the end of the experiment (84 h postchallenge), the concentrations of L-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate at 84 h were 1.58 \u00a7 0.24 and 2.69 \u00a7 0.70 M, respectively. The LPSstimulated NOS activity kept constant during the experiment. However, in M. japonicus, the NOS activity kept increasing during the Wrst 72 h postchallenge, the concentrations of L-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate increased from 7.82 \u00a7 0.77 at 0 h to 10.79 \u00a7 0.50 M at 72 h, and from 8.98 \u00a7 0.43 at 0 h to 11.20 \u00a7 0.37 M at 72 h, respectively. Then it decreased till the end of the experiment (216 h postchallenge), and the concentrations of L-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate at 216 h were 5.66 \u00a7 0.27 and 4.68 \u00a7 0.16 M, respectively. More importantly, an apparent increase of LPS-stimulated NOS activity was observed in M. japonicus at 48 h postchallenge, which was about 4 times higher than that in the control group of health shrimps. In correspondence with the diVerence of NOS activity between the two species of shrimps, the cumulative mortalities of the shrimps were also diVerent. All shrimps of F. chinensis in the mortality experiment died in 66 h, much more quickly than M. japonicus, whose accumulative mortality reached 100% after 240 h. Data here reported let us hypothesize that NOS activity in the haemocytes of shrimps F. chinensis and M. japonicus responses to WSSV infection diVerently, and this might be one of the reasons for the diVerent susceptibility of F. chinensis and M. japonicus to WSSV infection.",

However, the intensiWcation and environment degradation of shrimp farming have been accompanied by the development of many infectious diseases, especially from viral origin, which cause a dramatic decrease in shrimp production [1, 2] . White spot syndrome virus (WSSV), a circular double-strand DNA virus [3] [4] [5] [6] , has led to heavy crop loss and continues to seriously aVect the cultured penaeids in the shrimp farming systems around the world [7] . In this context, control of disease is very important to insure the long-term survival of shrimp aquaculture. Therefore, it is necessary to study the immune factors of shrimp in response to the invasion of WSSV, which may be helpful in understanding the mechanism of shrimp immunity to WSSV infection and developing strategies for management of the disease.",

            "text": "Belonging to invertebrate, shrimp lack a true adaptive immune response system [8] . However, living in an aquatic environment rich in microorganisms, shrimps have developed eVective systems for detecting and eliminating noxious microorganism depending on non-speciWc innate immune response based on the activity of haemocytes, including phagocytosis, phenoloxidase releasing, bactericidin synthesis, and so on [2] . Non-speciWc molecules like reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) and reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNIs) are also involved. Surprisingly, in shrimps, the function and immune status of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and its catalyzing products-nitric oxide, have been seldom reported. Nitric oxide is a very important component of innate immune system, which has the antiviral, anti-bacterial, and anti-parasite properties by damaging the DNA, enzyme and membrane of pathogen directly or indirectly through the action on the bases and strands of DNA, protein and lipid of membrane [9] [10] [11] [12] . Therefore, the role of NO and NOS in disease resistance of shrimps is worth studying. In this paper, we have tried diVerent methods to determine NOS activity in the haemocytes of Fenneropenaeus chinensis and Marsupenaeus japonicus qualitatively and quantitatively, and the role of the NOS in haemocytes of shrimps is also discussed in response to virus infection.",

Some of the recent researches have con-Wrmed the presence of NOS activity in haemocytes of invertebrates [15, 17, 21, 22, 29, 30] . Among these researches, techniques of analytical chemistry, immunohistochemistry, and cell and molecular biology have been used to identify NOS [15, 17, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . In this experiment, the NBT reduction and cellular conformation approach were employed to identify NOS in the haemocytes of M. japonicus and F. chinensis, under the stimulation of LPS. Both of the methods could conWrm the presence of NOS activity in the two species of shrimps, as reported previously in haemocytes of other invertebrates, like Mytilius edulis and Viviparus ater [15, 22] . However, the expression of NOS in haemocytes still needs to be further conWrmed with techniques like immunochemistry or polymerase chain reaction (PCR).",

            "text": "In vertebrates, three isoforms of NOS, which can be divided into two functional classes, have been found so far. The Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent neuronal NOS (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) belong to the constitutive class. They produce NO in short bursts in low concentrations for physiological purposes. The other class, which is mainly composed of Ca 2+ -independent inducible NOS (iNOS), is related to the diseases resistance of the organisms. iNOS found in innate immune cells and non-immune cells, such as macrophages and epithelial cells, can produce NO in high concentrations for as long as the enzyme is activated. The NO produced has anti-microbial actions against various intruding microbes, mediated by oxygen radicals, and active oxygen species through the formation of reactive nitrogen oxides like peroxynitrite (ONOO \u00a1 ), via a variety of mechanisms. However, in invertebrates, only Ca 2+ /calmodulin dependent form was found so far [28, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . And in crustaceans, NOS was reported mainly in the nervous system, regulating neuronal activity [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . Recently, Kim [28] reported that NOS could also be expressed in the Y-organ, gill, testis and ovary of the land crab, which suggested that NO was also involved in other physiological processes except for neuromodulation. It was also suggested by Kim that the localization of NOS in connective tissue and epithelia in Y-organ and gill might function in an immune response to pathogens. The expression of NOS caused by bacterial infection in haemocytes of insects, suggesting the potential role of NOS related to disease resistance, have also been reported previously [15, 50] . Here in our experiment, only a slight increase in NOS activity could be observed in the two species of shrimps shortly after WSSV infection, and then it decreased till the end of the experiment, probably due to the destruction of haemocytes caused by WSSV infection at the late stage of experiment [51] . However, the NOS activity in M. japonicus kept at a high level for a longer time than that of F. chinensis after WSSV infection.More interestingly, there was an apparent increase of LPS-stimulated NOS activity in M. japonicus 48 h after WSSV infection, in contrast to the relatively stable level of LPSstimulated NOS activity in F.chinensis. Referred to the diVerent sensitivity of the two species to WSSV infection, as indicated in the mortality experiment, the results on NOS activity analysis let us hypothesize that the NOS activity in haemocytes of the shrimps might have a relation to the disease resistance ability of the shrimps to WSSV infection.",

From some previous in vitro studies, it has been demonstrated that NO could inhibit the replication of a diverse range of viruses, especially for DNA viruses, such as murine poxvirus and herpes viruses, and some RNA viruses, such as Coxsackievirus [52] . However, for virus like coronavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and murine vaccinia virus, etc., the anti-viral eVect of NO remains unclear or uncertain [52] . Besides, the overproduction of NO will aVect the host defense through its eVects on the balance between the type 1 helper T cell (Th1) and type 2 helper T cell (Th2), and the pathological processes through the oxidative stress it caused. Therefore, its intriguing to understand the role of NO in resistance of virus infection. For iNOS activity, it has been reported that it could be induced by many diVerent virus in vertebrates [53] [54] [55] , through the direct up-regulation of virus or the indirect eVect mediated by pro-inXammatory cytokines such as interferon-. However, the inhibition of iNOS activity and NO production was also reported recently. It's hard to make a straightforward remark for the role of NO and iNOS in virus resistance among diVerent organisms to the infection caused by a variety of virus. And the situation is even worse for invertebrates, although there are some reports about the invertebrate NO synthesis [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] , none of them gave information either on NOS or NO in virus resistance. In our present study, we found that NOS activity in the haemocytes of the two species of shrimp's response diVerently to WSSV infection, which is in correspondence with the diVerent sensitivity of the two species. WSSV, reported as a large dsDNA virus belonging to the virus family Nimaviridae, genus Whispovirus [65] , might be a target of NO. And the observed increase of NOS activity and LPS-induced activity in M. japonicus shortly after WSSV infection might play a role in resistance to virus infection, which lead to a relatively longer surviving time of the species after WSSV infection. However, all these hypotheses need to be further studied to elucidate the role of NO and NOS in host defense and pathological process in WSSV infected shrimps.",

In the present study, the addition of LPS could also induce the NOS activity in haemocytes of shrimps, and the LPS-stimulated NOS activity in M. japonicus was much higher than that without LPS stimulation after WSSV infection. However, it still needs to be further examined that the induction of NOS activity is good or bad for the mitigation of WSSV infection. The only thing we observed was that M. japonicacus, with higher LPSstimulated NOS activity after WSSV infection, could survive longer than F. chinensis. If the mitigation eVect of increased NOS activity on WSSV infection could be con-Wrmed, it would be helpful for the development of proper immunostimulants, and for the understanding of the mechanisms of certain immunostimulants in host defense ability against the virus infection.",
