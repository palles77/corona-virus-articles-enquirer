The first COVID-19 case in South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020, from a traveling resident of Wuhan, China [2] . In February, the disease spread rapidly within a church community in the city of Daegu [2] . The chains of transmission that began from this cluster distinguish the epidemic in South Korea from that in any other countries: As of March 24, 2020, 9,037 cases were confirmed, of which 56% were related to the church and 27% were in their 20s [2] . South Korea's intensive testing using novel contact tracing techniques allowed rapid identification and isolation cases and reduction of onward transmission [3, 4, 5] . Here, we describe potential roles of social distancing in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea by using metro traffic data to compare epidemics in two major cities.",

Likewise, the estimates of R t gradually decrease and eventually drop below 1 about a week after the reporting of its first case, coinciding with the decrease in the metro traffic volume (Fig. 2C ). The initial decrease in R t may reflect behavior change within the church; the first confirmed case in Daegu became symptomatic on February 7, 2020, and visited the church on February 9 and 16, 2020 [2] . Our estimates of R t for Daegu are consistent with the estimates of R t for South Korea by Abbott et al. [17] -their estimates drop below 1 slightly later because they rely on number of symptomatic cases instead.",
