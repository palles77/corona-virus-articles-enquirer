While COVID-19 has spread globally, the outbreak has been controlled in some countries (e.g. South Korea, Japan) versus rapidly escalated in other areas (e.g. Italy, Spain), largely based on public health measures that have blunted the peak number of cases. 2 As dermatologists, the majority of our outpatient visits are non-emergent. Given our exposure to many individuals through high volume clinics and that asymptomatic carriers can shed viral particles for weeks before (or even without) symptoms, we feel it is prudent to immediately cancel all non-urgent visits indefinitely. Screening patients and cancelling appointments only for those with fevers is not sufficient as there is known asymptomatic viral transmission and a prolonged incubation period. 3 Indeed, fever was only present in 43.9% of 7736 patients at time of hospital admission with Covid-19 in a study of 552 hospitals in mainland China. 4 Emerging research also suggests that COVID-19 viral particles remain viable in aerosol for several hours and can survive several days on multiple surfaces. 5 In summary, we feel the following measures should be immediately implemented:",
