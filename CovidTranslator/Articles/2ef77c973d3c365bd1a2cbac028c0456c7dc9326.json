Isolation has been effectively accomplished using a single patient room with negative air pressure and a ventilation system separated from the rest of the hospital. 1 Airborne infection isolation refers to the isolation of patients infected with organisms spread by airborne droplet nuclei less than 5 mm in diameter. This isolation area receives 6 to 12 air changes per hour and is under negative pressure so that the direction of airflow is from the outside adjacent space (eg, corridor) into the room. The air in an airborne infection isolation room is preferably exhausted to the outside, but may be recirculated, provided that the return air is filtered through a highefficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. The use of personal respiratory protection is indicated for persons entering these rooms. 2 Negative-pressure rooms are generally expensive to build, with new construction costs, according to a 1988 figure, ranging from $40,000 to $50,000 per room. 3 Recent naturally occurring outbreaks of influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have underscored the need to develop a flexible capacity for isolation to contain an outbreak. 4 The risk of bioterrorism with a transmissible pathogen such as smallpox or plague has necessitated planning for the contingency of having to isolate large numbers of patients. Such planning calls for airborne infection isolation that is well beyond the scope of current isolation practices at most hospitals and requires either retrofitting existing facilities or constructing new ones.",

The rooms were located in the following settings: hospitals (59%), correctional facilities (40%), and nursing homes (1%). Each room was tested with visible smoke for directional airflow into the patient room (ie, negative air pressure relative to adjacent areas). Inappropriate outward airflow was observed in 38% of the isolation rooms tested. These findings indicate that a balanced ventilation system does not guarantee inward airflow direction. Devices that continuously monitor and, in some cases, control pressurization were noted to have poor reliability. 6 Infections among health care workers have been a common feature of SARS since its emergence. The majority of these infections have occurred in locations where infection-control precautions either had not been instituted or had been instituted but were not followed. Previously recommended infection-control precautions from 2002 included the use of negative-pressure isolation rooms; N95 or higher level of respiratory protection; gloves, gowns, and eye protection; and careful hand hygiene. A 2003 report from the CDC demonstrated that a cluster of SARS cases among health care workers in a hospital occurred despite apparent compliance with recommended infection-control precautions. In fact, hospitals, because of infection of health care workers, appeared to be sites of SARS epidemic amplification during the epidemic of 2002 to 2003 7 ; therefore, HEPA filtration and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation are recommended as additional infection control measures. 4 Increasing hospital capacity to care for patients requiring respiratory isolation is a current focus of emergency preparedness efforts nationwide (Health Resources and Services Administration/CDC grant guidance 2003). The recognition that a mass casualty incident as a result of an intentionally released agent or an epidemic from a naturally occurring outbreak of illness could overwhelm current isolation capabilities has resulted in many suggested plans to handle such an event. Christiana Care Health System and the Delaware Health Care Preparedness Committee sought to examine these methods and design a system to meet our needs.",

In large health care facilities with central HVAC systems, sealed windows help to ensure the efficient operation of the system, especially with respect to creating and maintaining pressure differentials. Sealing the windows in isolation areas helps minimize the risk of airborne contamination to the outside. 4 There was some concern about the proximity of the exhaust ports to the elevated air intake shaft. In addition, the air intake shaft and the patient arrival area appear to be in close proximity to the exhaust from this space.

Air from rooms housing tuberculosis patients is exhausted to the outside if possible or passed through a HEPA filter before recirculation. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation can be used as an adjunct aircleaning measure, but it cannot replace HEPA filtration. 9 We did not test an ultraviolet germicidal irradiation unit because the need for one in this setting is unclear. The use of ultraviolet lamps and HEPA filtration in a single unit offers only minimal infection-control benefits over those provided by the use of a HEPA filter alone. 10 The portable airflow units were used to draw air through the care area, creating air changes in excess of the current CDC guidelines that specify 12 air changes per hour for particles smaller than 5 mm. 4 The pressure gradient generated was acceptable and exceeded the minimum of 5 Pa (20.02 inches of water) required for asbestos removal projects and on medical isolation facilities, which require a minimum of 2.5 Pa (20.01 inches of water) for an isolation room. 4, 8 This gradient indicated a pressure differential that would ensure isolation of air from this patient care area away from the rest of the hospital. The total cost of the project was less than $6,000, including the 4 portable airflow HEPA units, flexible ductwork, door and air return conversion, and installation of dedicated highoutput power outlets.

This 24-hour level is a potentially important consideration for patient safety. The level of 76 dB, although below maximal occupational levels, would be louder than operation of a household vacuum (70 dB per National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 1973 source) and would still potentially be annoying.
