Lobular maldevelopment with deficient alveolarization and lymphangiectasis are also commonly observed. 1, [11] [12] [13] Although it has been speculated that infants with delayed or less fulminant (atypical) presentations may have nonuniform distribution of disease that does not involve the entire lung, less abnormal density and placement of capillaries, or more normal lobular development, 5, 14, 15 limited information regarding the lung histopathology of these infants is available and often from only a single biopsy site.",

We obtained informed consent from parents of all infants and children and this study was approved by the Human Research Protection Office at Washington University. We reviewed clinical history, results from echocardiogram, cardiac catheterization, and chest computed tomography (CT), explant histology, and post-transplant course. We used Sanger sequencing to identify mutations in FOXF1 as described previously. 17 We analyzed genomic copy number variants (CNVs) using array comparative genomic hybridization with custom-designed 16q24.1 region-specific 3_720 K microarrays (Roche NimbleGen, Madison, Wisconsin). 17 A pediatric pathologist with expertise in childhood ILD and the diagnostic features of ACDMPV reviewed all explants. At least 2 sections from each lobe of the explant were reviewed for each subject (median number of sections per explant, 22; range, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Explant histology was compared with autopsy histology from 3 infants with classic ACDMPV and genetic defects of FOXF1 (2 with missense point mutations and 1 with a CNV deletion upstream of FOXF1). ACDMPV histologic criteria were characterized for each explant. 15, 18 Microscopic observations of alveolar capillaries were made on fields of congested, noncollapsed lung, in which architecture and capillaries were well-visualized. Findings of deficient capillarization of alveoli were described as \"diffuse\" (present throughout all fields, with difficulty in identifying normal capillarization in most fields), \"mixed\" (mixture of both normal and deficient capillarization throughout lung), and \"focal\" (predominantly normal, with focal areas of deficient capillarization). Findings of pulmonary vein malposition adjacent to small arteries were described as \"extensive\" (readily identified throughout the lung, with malposition in the majority of BVBs), \"patchy\" (identified throughout the lung, but in fewer than onehalf of BVBs), and \"focal\" (present, but in a minority of BVBs and not readily identified). Assessment of malposition of pulmonary veins did not include BVBs with tangential orientation in which a vein could not be excluded. Findings of medial hypertrophy of small arteries and arterioles were graded \"mild,\" \"moderate,\" or \"severe,\" ranging from mild medial thickening to occlusive lesions. Lobular maldevelopment with deficient alveolarization was noted based on the presence of enlarged alveoli with apparent decrease in numbers of alveoli and was described as \"present,\" \"suggestive\" (areas suggestive of deficient alveolarization), or \"not suggestive.\" Lymphangiectasis was characterized as primarily involving the interlobular septae or involving both the interlobular septae and the BVBs.",

Although our study is limited in that explant histology may be confounded by differences in pretransplant treatment (mechanical ventilation, prolonged oxygen exposure) and chronologic age, the nonuniformity of histopathologic characteristics suggests that disruption of lung development in this disease is location specific and may be influenced by the local cellular and growth factor milieu. It is important to note that all 6 explants had areas of lung with normal capillary loops, a finding that illustrates the challenge of making a diagnosis of ACDMPV on a single specimen lung biopsy for patients with atypical presentations. Because point mutations or CNV deletions that involve FOXF1 are present in approximately 80%-90% of infants with classic ACDMPV 10 and 3 of 5 infants tested in our series, diagnostic sequencing of FOXF1 may preclude the need for lung biopsy. 25 Failure to identify FOXF1 point mutations or CNV deletions in 2 of the 5 subjects tested suggests that other genes may contribute to or modify the ACDMPV phenotype. 10 All 6 infants in our series had clinical and histologic evidence for significant pulmonary hypertension. Medial wall hypertrophy, although present, was less pronounced among the 3 infants with classic ACDMPV (Table IV) . It is unclear whether this difference reflects a primary process related to endothelial cell proliferation or is secondary to therapies or chronic/ prolonged disruption of the pulmonary vascular bed. For 5 atypical ACDMPV infants, the severity of their pulmonary hypertension contributed to the eventual need for intensive medical and mechanical respiratory support before transplantation. Presumably, their pulmonary hypertension resulted from an anatomically fixed, decreased number of pulmonary capillaries within the alveolar epithelium, misaligned pulmonary veins, and abnormal lobular development. Although neonates with classic ACDMPV typically have transient but nonsustained responses to pulmonary vasodilators, 1 3 atypical ACDMPV infants (subjects 2, 4, and 6) demonstrated a reduction in pulmonary resistance with inhaled nitric oxide administration during cardiac catheterization, and successful treatment of all 6 infants with pulmonary vasodilators suggests pharmacologically reversible components of pulmonary hypertension. However, our study was not specifically designed to determine the effects of these therapies thereby limiting this finding. The usefulness of these medications among infants with atypical ACDMPV compared with classic ACDMPV may reflect in part the heterogeneous nature of their disease or the diversity of the underlying biologic or developmental mechanisms.",

In contrast with infants with atypical ACDMPV, infants with idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension typically are not hypoxemic without a significant intracardiac shunt and usually do not have abnormalities of the pulmonary parenchyma on chest CT. 26 Infants with biallelic loss of function mutations in surfactant proteins (SFTPB, ABCA3) typically present with severe neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and have chest radiograph findings consistent with surfactant deficiency. 27 Infants with dominant point mutations in SFTPC or missense variants in ABCA3 can present beyond the newborn period with childhood ILD and pulmonary hypertension, which when present, is associated with increased mortality. 28 The presentation of pulmonary venoocclusive disease and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis with hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension, and abnormal CT scan results (patchy centrilobular pattern of ground glass opacities, pavement appearance to lobules) can make differentiation from ACDMPV potentially difficult. Owing to the wide variability and timing of presentations, atypical ACDMPV should remain in the differential diagnosis of any infant with hypoxemia and idiopathic pulmonary hypertension including those with chest CT findings of ILD; clinical testing of FOFX1 in these patients may be diagnostic.",
