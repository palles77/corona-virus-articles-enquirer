However, these results were not reproducible and there was no difference in the proportion of positive signals from the MS patients compared to controls.

One MS patient was completely excluded as no RNA was detectable in any of the samples extracted. The sensitivity of the assays were in the range of below 10 for the nested PCR assays to 100 Tissue culture infective doses. Of the specimens tested, 32% were positive in at least one assay. An example of a PCR result is shown in Fig. 1 . For comparison between the MS group and controls each individual was only counted once using the first specimen extracted and assay performed (Table 3 ). In one nested PCR assay for HCV-229E, 31% of the patients were found positive. These results could not be reproduced by repeating the same PCR or on the other PCR analyses, neither on the same or different specimens. These PCR products were sequenced and found identical to the expected sequence from the human coronaviral nucleocapsid gene. There was no proportional difference in these sporadic positive signals between the MS group and controls. No patient or control was consistently positive, neither on reanalysis of RNA from the same extraction or different specimens from the same individual.",

A further 17 specimens gave a positive RT-PCR for MBP, but had a low total absorption and a low A 260 /A 280 ratio and were thus excluded due to low total RNA content. The remaining 76 specimens had optimal yield and quality. The amount of total RNA in brain tissue should not decrease significantly at least up to 48 h postmortem [10, 14, 21] ; however, some specific mRNA may have shorter half-life [18] . Premortem and postmortem factors may both increase and decrease expression of specific mRNA, but this is mainly important when attempting quantitative RT-PCR [18] . In this study MBP-RNA was amplified from most specimens including the older tissues dating back to 1966. It has been described that storage of RNA at -70\u00b0C for more than 5 years may affect the use of RNA for in vitro expression studies but sufficient partial or full-length RNA may remain for PCR studies [14] .",

One explanation could be a very low level presence of coronaviral target gene in only some of the specimens. If very few (in the order of 10 1 or less) copies of the target gene are present the initiation of amplification in a PCR process becomes problematic. This is due to the probability of a target gene copy being present in aliquot and the probability of the primer annealing to the specific template. A low level presence of coronaviruses in the human brain could be possible after an ordinary episode of common cold due to coronaviruses. In animal models murine coronaviruses have been found to enter the brain of mice, rats and owl monkeys after intranasal inoculation [3, 5, 19, 20] and both a hematogenous spread and direct entry via the olfactory nerve has been found.",

This could be a bias in the previous studies due to more specimens/assays recorded in the groups of patients with MS. The two studies describing HCV genome in the human brain tissue have both counted all the patients with at least one positive signal, disregarding negative results of repeat specimens [16, 25] . Murray et al. [15] used in situ hybridization techniques and found 52% of the patients with MS positive, but only 11% of the 442 sections examined were positive. In the control group 0.8% of 376 sections were positive. In the positive sections only few cells were positive. This study is comparable to the present study in regards to the paucity of the positive signals observed. Talbot et al. [25] have examined 21 specimens from 11 patients with MS and 11 specimens from 11 controls. Not all samples from the positive patients were found positive for HCV-229E. However, the results from the positive specimens were reproducible in contrast to the present study. Weighted pooling of the data (Table 4) shows that more patients with MS were positive compared to controls. This estimate could be biased, as negative studies are less likely to be published [8] .",
