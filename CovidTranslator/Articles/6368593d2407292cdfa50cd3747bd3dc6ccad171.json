However, in this phase the animal shed the virus at high titers in all the body fluids, thus posing a serious threat for other susceptible dogs in close contact with the animal. In such epidemiological circumstances, a wrong or delayed diagnosis of CDV infection may have dramatic consequences. As expected, in the serum samples collected from dog A, CDV-specific antibodies were not detected in virus neutralization, and were rather low in ELISA. These results may be accounted for by the fact that ELISA technique can detect antibodies to all the viral proteins, including the major internal N protein that elicits the highest antibody response in morbillivirus infections (von Messling et al., 1999) . This would suggest that it is better to use assays based either on the whole virion or on the N protein when evaluating CDV serological status.",
