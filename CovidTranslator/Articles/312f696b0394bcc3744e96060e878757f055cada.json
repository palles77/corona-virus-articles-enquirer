To achieve the non-selective amplification and recovery of low abundance genetic sequences, a simplified Sequence-Independent, Single-Primer Amplification (SISPA) technique in combination with MiSeq platform was applied to target negative-and positive-sense single-stranded RNA viral sequences. This method allowed successful sequence assembly of full or near full length avian influenza virus (AIV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) viral genome. Moreover, SISPA analysis applied to unknown clinical cases of mixed viral infections produced genome assemblies comprising 98% NDV and 99% of IBV genomes. Complete or near complete virus genome sequence was obtained with titers at or above 10 4.5 EID 50 / ml (50% embryo infectious dose), and virus identification could be detected with titers at or above 10 3 EID 50 / ml. Taken together, these studies demonstrate a simple template enrichment protocol for rapid detection and accurate characterization of avian RNA viruses.",

In the absence of targeted sequencing protocols, as well as during outbreak situations, the random amplification of purified nucleic acids in combination with NGS can be a useful tool for monitoring viral evolution or diagnosis. Although most molecular detection methods are unable to detect mixed viral infections, NGS allows for both target dependent and target independent sequencing of viral genomes and provides an opportunity to detect the genome of multiple viruses simultaneously (Thorburn et al., 2015) .

This combines first-step reverse transcription followed by denaturation, annealing and amplification by using random hexamers tagged with a known sequence which is then used as a primer binding extension sequence. It was developed to yield doublestranded cDNA in sufficient abundance for cloning and then sequencing (Froussard, 1993; Zou et al., 2003) . DePew et al.

Among RNA viruses, AIV of Orthomyxoviridae family and NDV of Paramyxoviridae family are considered as the most devastating poultry diseases owing to their highly pathogenic forms as well as worldwide distribution and economic implications (Swayne, 2008; Miller et al., 2010a; Alexander et al., 2012) . IBV of the Coronaviridae family also causes significant morbidity and economic losses to the poultry industry affecting primarily the respiratory tract, and can demonstrate a wide range of tissues tropism, including the renal and reproductive systems (Bande et al., 2016) . Combining target independent genome amplification with the high sensitivity of NGS provides the opportunity not only for detection of these viral pathogens, but can also simultaneously provide complete genomic sequences to allow further genetic characterization. Nonetheless, the feasibility of applying these techniques to diagnosis and research of pathogens requires further evaluation and optimization study.",

Detailed statistics on the NDV and IBV genomes assembly are provided in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3, respectively. Although the genome coverage of virus with titers below 10 3.0 EID 50 /ml was decreased, it was still possible to detect AIV and NDV viral genomes using Kraken metagenomics approach. For example, with the AIV clinical sample (10 2.5 EID 50 /ml), out of 105,544 total reads classified, 49.0% were classified to the domain level, 23.6% to the family level, and 24.3% to the species level. Influenza A virus represented 100% of ssRNA viruses, 23% of reads classified to the virus level and 0.6% of all reads classified. For NDV with the viral titer of 10 2.5 EID 50 /ml out of 117,062 total reads classified, 53.9% reads were categorized into domain level, 14.7% into family level, and 19.8% into species level. NDV represented 96% of reads classified to ssRNA viruses, 4.0% of reads classified to the virus level and 0.9% of all reads classified. IBV, was not detected when the virus titer was below 10 3 EID 50 /ml. The limit of detection for IBV by the Kraken metagenomics approach used lies at 10 3.1 EID 50 /ml. In this case, out of 34,254 reads classified, 25.6% were categorized into domain level, 22.3% into family level, and 18.8% into species level. Avian coronavirus represented 98% of positive ssRNA viruses and 2% of viruses.",

Since there was no overwhelming competition with other non-specific sequences as observed in sequence-independent approach, the depth of coverage in sequence-dependent sequencing was higher than that of SISPA-NGS method. However, below 10 6 viral particles per RT-PCR reaction, assembled sequences of AIVs were missing nearly 50% of one of the genes (the coverage of PB1 segment of Dk/Vn H5N1 was 54.2% and NA gene of A/chicken/Jordan/13/2003 was 52.9%). The genome coverage of each segment was substantially decreased in samples with the titer below 10 5 viral particles per RT-PCR reaction, especially for gene longer than 1.7 kb, such as PB2, PB1, PA, and HA (Table S4) .

Moreover, NGS technologies provide opportunities to screen for pathogens in outbreak situations from known and novel or unexpected pathogens in a single reaction. Thus, developing the simple, universal and fast amplification protocol that yields double-stranded cDNA in sufficient abundance can facilitate and expedite the whole-genome sequencing and might be a useful procedure for use not only in research but also in routine clinical diagnosis. So far, several research groups have optimized and adapted modifications of SISPA method of viral genomes and coupled it to the construction of a plasmid library generating full or near full length viral genomes (Allander et al., 2001; Djikeng et al., 2008) . Palmenberg et al. (2009) have successfully applied the SISPA method to obtain the complete genome sequence of human RNA viruses, including the full length genome sequences of a total of 78 rhinovirus isolates available at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). In turn, Rosseel et al. (2012) applied the DNase SISPA method to detect Schmallenberg virus in infected field samples. Other groups have also used the DNase-SISPA technique for the detection of bovine and human viruses (Allander et al., 2001; Djikeng and Spiro, 2009) , for the identification of a novel human coronavirus (van der Hoek et al., 2004) and for viral discovery in the plasma of HIV infected patients (Jones et al., 2005) .",

It was possible to extract and amplify RNA in 5 h using modified SISPA protocol and identify the viral genomes in 3 days (including 49 h Illumina Miseq run). The protocol presented here, do not require a pre-processing step, duplication of amplification, or pooling of samples (Depew et al., 2013) . We applied a denaturation step before conversion of cDNA into dsDNA by Klenow polymerase and size selection after the Klenow reaction and PCR amplification, which improved the yield of double-stranded cDNA and increased the average size of fragments.

It is predominantly useful for obtaining genome sequences from RNA viruses, uncharacterized RNA viruses, or investigating complex clinical samples (such as mixed infections in single reaction) as no prior sequence information is needed. As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2 , the SISPA method in combination with NGS can be a useful random priming method for a molecular detection of mixed viral infections for disease diagnosis in a single reaction. Not unexpectedly, the detection limit was dependent on viral load in the samples. Based on these findings, a minimum initial virus titer of 10 4.5 EID 50 /ml was needed to obtain the full or nearly full genome sequence as the titer of the virus correlated positively with the genome coverage. Secondly, for diagnostic detection, identification of already known agents required a minimum titer of 10 3 EID 50 /ml. We also demonstrate that non-specific bacterial or host genes in clinical samples can greatly reduce the efficiency of viral genome amplification and sequencing. Metagenomics analysis of samples that contain less than 10 3.0 EID 50 /ml of the viruses was possible, but could vary greatly and result in low reproducibility if the sample contains a high amount of non-viral or host genes. In this case a pre-processing step in the sample preparation, such as DNase treatment and filtration, could improve the efficacy of viral amplification and sequencing.",

The sequence-dependent AIV sequencing allowed us to generate complete genome sequence when the sample contained at least 10 6 EID 50 /ml of virus, and the depth of coverage was higher than that obtained from SISPA amplification. The limitation of this method is its relatively higher limit of detection and the need of primer sequences at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genes. Comparison of sequence-dependent and sequence-independent sequencing approaches for AIV showed that both of the methods can result in complete genome sequences when the virus titer is higher than 10 5.0 EID 50 /ml. In this case, the method of choice depends on the purpose of the study (screening, virus discovery, diagnosis, SNP analysis, etc.). Below 10 5.0 EID 50 /ml, sequence-independent amplification can result in lower depth of coverage, but better overall coverage for large segments. In addition, both methods showed uneven distribution of sequence reads between segments. Optimization of PCR condition could be helpful to improve this limitation by extending the random oligomer sequence (Rosseel et al., 2013) , using different 5\u2032 defined tag sequences (Zhou et al., 2009) , and using augmented PCR cycling for long segments.",
