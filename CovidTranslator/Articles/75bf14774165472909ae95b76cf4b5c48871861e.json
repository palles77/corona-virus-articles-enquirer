This milestone event was accomplished in the laboratories of E. Wimmer (Kitamura et ul., 1981) and D. Baltimore (Racaniello and Baltimore, 1981) . The knowledge of the primary structure of poliovirus RNA not only solved (or helped to solve) many outstanding problems, but also confronted researchers with new puzzles. The 5'-untranslated region (5-UTR) of the viral genome was one of such unexpected problems. This segment proved to be immensely long: about 750 nucleotides, or -10% of the genome length. There were also other unusual features (e.g., multiple AUG triplets preceding the single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes the viral polyprotein). A question arose: \"What useful purpose could this giant noncoding genomic segment serve?\"",

As we shall see, the picornaviral5-UTRs are not only involved in such essential events as the synthesis of viral proteins and RNAs (which could be expected to some extent, although some of the underlying mechanisms appeared to be quite a surprise), but also may determine diverse biological phenotypes, from the plaque size or thermosensitivity of reproduction to attenuation of neurovirulence. Furthermore, a close inspection of the 5-UTR structure unravels certain hidden facets of the evolution of the picornaviral genome. Finally, the conclusions drawn from the experiments with the picornaviral5-UTRs provide important clues for understanding the functional capabilities of the eukaryotic ribosomes.",

Rivera et al., 1988; Pilipenko et al., 1989a) . For cases in which the RNA primary structure is not yet available, hybridization studies revealed a close relationship among the 5-UTRs of numerous enteroviruses (coxsackie A and B, echo-, and polioviruses), except echovirus 22 and enterovirus 71 Bruce et al., 1989; cf. Hyypia et al., 1989) .

This feature was found to be characteristic of the genomes of all entero-and rhinoviruses investigated thus far (Rivera et al., 1988; K. H. Chang et al., 1989) . There is evidence that the hairpin is involved in a physiologically significant function ) (Section VIII). Secondary structure models for the very 5'-proximal segments of the 5-UTRs were also proposed for the EMCV (Vartapetian et al., 19831, TMEV (Pevear et al., 19881, FMDV (Harris, 1979 Newton et al., 1985; Clarke et al., 19871, and HAV (Paul et al., 1987) genomes. Although experimental support is available only for the EMCV model (Vartapetian et al., 1983) , the similarity of several elements in the EMCV, TMEV, and FMDV structures strongly suggests the existence of a consensus folding (Pevear et al., 1988; Pilipenko et al., 1990) .

A powerful approach to RNA secondary structure modeling (especially if this structure is expected to be of functional significance) consists of deduction of a consensus folding for numerous related RNA species by taking into account not only fully conserved nucleotide sequences, but also, and in particular, compensating mutations in pairs of noncontiguous bases (cf. Fox and Woese, 1975; Noller and Woese, 1981; James et al., 1988) . When this approach was applied to the picornaviral5-UTRs, no general consensus was found; however, highly conserved secondary structure models could be derived for entero-and rhinoviruses, on the one hand (Rivera et al., 1988; Blinov et al., 1988; Pilipenko et al., 1989a) , and cardio-and aphthoviruses, on the other (Pilipenko et al., 198813, 1990) . The models for entero-and rhinovirus 5-UTRs proposed by Rivera et al., (1988) and Pilipenko et al. (1989a; see also Blinov et al., 19881 , while sharing many secondary structure elements, differed nevertheless from one another in some significant aspects (significant because they involved certain physiologically important regions). The models proposed by Pilipenko et al. (1989a,b) for entero-and rhinovirus as well as cardio-and aphthovirus RNAs were supported experimentally by testing the susceptibility to chemical modifications and to a hydrolytic attack by single-strandand double-strand-specific nucleases; a similar folding was also deduced for poliovirus 5-UTRs by Skinner et al. (1989) . Figures 1 and 2 present the consensus models for the two groups of picornavirus 5-UTRs.",

To what extent, however, do they reflect the RNA folding inside the infected cell? It is difficult, if at all possible to obtain a complete answer to this question. Nevertheless, genetic evidence strongly favors the in uiuo reality of at least some elements of the proposed secondary structures. Thus, the model ( Fig.  1) predicts pairing between nucleotides 480 and 525 in the poliovirus type 1 RNA. In all but one sequenced entero-and rhinovirus genome the corresponding nucleotides are expected to form a n A-U pair (Pilipenko et al., 1989a) . The only known exception is the Sabin type l strain, having G480 instead of A; obviously, the potential to form a base pair between nucleotides 480 and 525 must in this case be diminished. In the gut of those vaccinated, however, the Sabin 1 genome appears to be unstable, and mutations in one of the two nucleotides under discussion are readily selected for. Either G480 is mutated back to A or u 5 2 5 is replaced by C; the potential to form a base pair between nucleotides 480 and 525 is fully restored in either case (Muzychenko et al., 1991 ; see also Agol, 1990) . Similar evidence for the biological relevance of the same secondary structure element in the poliovirus genome can be derived from the experiments described by Kuge and Nomoto (1987) .",

The hypothesis states that a Met-tRNApt-bearing 40 S ribosomal subunit aided by specific initiation factors recognizes the capped 5' end of an mRNA molecule and moves along it until the first AUG is encountered. Here, a 60 S subunit is recruited to form a complete ribosome, and the polypeptide chain synthesis is initiated. Accordingly, two major types of translational cis-acting elements were first considered: the cap structure and the initiator AUG.",

The modified version suggests that the ribosome scanning might be \"leaky\" (i.e., able to skip an AUG). Whether or not the AUG is recognized as the initiator codon largely depends on its \"context\" (i.e., the surrounding sequences), the optimal context being (CC)&CCAUGG (Kozak, 1984a (Kozak, , 1986a [a more extended version of the context consensus is (GCC)GCC&CCAUGG (see Kozak, 1987a Kozak, , 1987c Kozak, , 1989a l. Upstream AUGs, depending on the context, may to some extent interfere with the \"correct\" initiation due to \"false starts,\" distracting ribosomes from their proper destination (Kozak, 1984b; Liu et al., 1984; Hunt, 19851 , but such a situation, in eukaryotic mRNAs, was considered to be \"breaking the rule\" (Kozak, 1989a) . Moreover, there is a possibility that, on completing the translation of a n ORF, the ribosome (or its smaller subunit) does not dissociate from the template, but rather continues scanning and reinitiates a new polypeptide at the next AUG; in such cases the relative efficiencies of the usage of the upstream and downstream initiation codons depends not only on their contexts, but also on other peculiarities of the given template (e.g., whether the respective ORFs are overlapping or not, how far they are located from each other and from the 5' end, and some other conditions) (Kozak, 1984b (Kozak, ,1986c (Kozak, , 198713,1989b Johansen et al., 1984; van Duijn et al., 1988; Dabrowski and Alwine, 1988; Williams and Lamb, 1989) .

On the other hand, unstructured regions of the template, even if they precede a stable hairpin, may facilitate initiation (cf. Kozak, 1988) . Finally, a eukaryotic analog of the Shine-Dalgarno element (i,e., an oligopyrimidine sequence, just upstream of the initiator AUG, which is complementary to a segment of the 18 S ribosomal RNA) was also proposed to promote proper ribosome binding to the template (Hagenbuche et al., 1978) .

The exceptions to this rule are of obvious interest. First, the sequence that opens the HAV polyprotein ORF has an A residue at position 4. One may wonder whether this has anything to do with the notoriously weak template activity of the HAV RNA in uitro and/or the very slow reproduction of this virus within the infected cell. Second, an A at position 4 may be accompanied by a pyrimidine at position -3 in the segment surrounding the first AUG of the polyproteincoding sequence of several FMDV serotypes (see also Robertson et al., 1985; Sanger et al., 1987) . This may reflect the fact that only a portion of ribosomes actually initiate translation at the first AUG of the FMDV polyprotein reading frame; the others, on the other hand, appear to ignore this triplet and continue scanning until they encounter the next AUG (which, by the way, is in the frame with the previous one and is located in a favorable context). Accordingly, two sites of translation initiation could be demonstrated to operate on the FMDV genome, and the choice between these site appears to depend, at least in part, on the context of the respective AUGs (Sangar et al., 1987) . Third, a pyrimidine (C) occupies position -3 (and a \"good G occupies position 4) in the vicinity of the coxsackievirus A21 initiator triplet; by the way, this RNA contains at least two more upstream AUGs having a context of similar \"strength\" (Hughes et al., 1989) . The physiological significance of this \"abnormality\" is not immediately apparent, because the template activity of the appropriate RNA remains to be evaluated.",

The situation in entero-and rhinovirus genomes is somewhat different: Here, a conserved oligopyrimidine sequence could be found in the 560-570 region (i.e., well apart from the genuine initiator triplet). Nevertheless, there is a possibility that this oligopyrimidine tract may be involved in the interaction with ribosomes.",

Since position 472 does not coincide with any internal AUGs and a mutation diminishing the efficiency of initiation should decrease, rather than increase, the stability of the appropriate secondary structure element [corresponding evidence was published later (Blinov et al., 1988; Pilipenko et al., 1989a) ], we suggested \"that a sequence around position 472 is involved, directly or indirectly, in interactions with ribosomes or initiation factors, and that the strength of this interaction may be altered by mutations at position 472\" (in the poliovirus type 3 RNA) (Svitkin et al., 1985) . It should be noted that at that time the possibility, though unlikely, could not be rigorously ruled out that mutations other than in the region 472-480 were actually responsible for the alterations of the template activity of RNAs from attenuated poliovirus strains.

Thus, the inactivation of the cap-dependent mechanism of translation initiation by poliovirus infection rendered the first cistron inactive, and the expression of the second cistron could hardly be attributed to the ribosomes coming from the template 5' end. Rather, this expression should be due to the turning-on of a novel mechanism, most likely involving internal ribosome binding mediated by the intercistronic poliovirus-derived 5-UTR. The selective translation of the second cistron of the bicistronic template could be demonstrated even in the mock-infected cells, provided that the transfected cells were incubated under hypertonic conditions [it has long been known that translation initiation on poliovirus RNA, as opposed to cellular mRNAs, is much more resistant to hypertonic salt concentrations (Nuss et al., 197511.

The first cistron in the bicistronic templates used was represented either by the TK gene again or by the US gene of reovirus type 2 (Pelletier and Sonenberg, 19891 , whereas the CAT gene served as the second cistron in both types of constructs. In reticulocyte lysates the second cistron of the bicistronic template could be expressed, provided it had been juxtaposed to the poliovirus 5-UTR. Moreover, it continued to be expressed even when the translation of the first cistron had been abrogated by the insertion of a stable hairpin structure in its own 5-TJTR . Clear-cut results were also obtained in extracts from poliovirus-infected HeLa cells, in which the bicistronic template with the intercistronic poliovirus 5-UTR directed the synthesis of only the second gene (CAT) product . The results obtained in the same study with extracts from uninfected HeLa cells were also fully compatible with the theory on the ability of POliovirus 5-UTR to direct internal ribosome binding. Now that this theory is supported with reasonable certainty, we can attempt to deduce, from the available data, the approximate borders of the translational cis-acting element involved. To this end, it would seem logical to assume that the sequences, whose removal or mutational alterations do not appear to affect significantly the function of the element, are located outside its body. Such an approach, simple as it is, is not devoid of pitfalls. The nucleotide sequence of the element, while forming a complex three-dimensional entity, is expected to be (and actually is), in a sense, discontinuous; some of its internal portions may be (and perhaps are) of no serious functional significance. Therefore, the finding of a silent portion of the 5-UTR does not necessarily mean that it lies beyond the borders of the cis element. There is another ambiguity. The element could be considered to be composed of the essential core, whose absence results in the complete invalidation of the internal initiation mechanism and dispensable, yet functionally significant, surrounding sequences. In practice it is not always easy to judge whether a particular genomic alteration totally inactivates the element's function, affects it significantly, or leaves it unchanged. Taking into account these limitations, let us consider the experimental data accumulated thus far. First, we shall attempt to define the location of the element as a whole; then the possible functional significance of its individual components is discussed.",

More extended deletions, 570-726 or 564-726, also produce viable progeny, but the mutant viruses exhibit a small-plaque (BPI phenotype due to their retarded growth rate (see also Iizuka et al., 1989) . Assuming that phenotypic changes in this series of mutants are largely due to the altered function of the cis-acting translation control element (and we believe that this is a likely assumption), it could be concluded that the downstream border of this element should map between positions 564 and 600. The border may perhaps lie even farther to the 3' end since the 5-UTR region affected by the deletions includes repeated sequences, and therefore reformation of nearly normal structural features may be feasible in some of the deletion mutants (Pilipenko et d., 1990 ) (see also Section X).",

In agreement with the aforementioned data of Kuge and Nomoto (1987) , the removal of nucleotides 632-732 did not affect the template activity, whereas the template lacking nucleotides 462-732 (or 382-732) was completely devoid, under the experimental conditions used, of the capacity to direct the synthesis of polypeptides encoded in the downstream cistron. These data placed the 3' border of the cis element between positions 462 and 632. So far as the 5' border of the element is conmrned, the deletion of the first 32 or 79 nucleotides from the 5-UTR was without any signidcant effect on the cap-independent internal ribosome binding in experiments with bicistmnic templates and extracts from poliovirus-infected HeLa cells (Pelletier et ul., 1988b; .

On the other hand, however, the complete removal of this domain did not seem to abrogate the cap-independent initiation of translation, at least in certain cell-free systems (Bienkowska-Szewczyk and Pestova et al., 19891 , although it should be noted that no rigorous proof was provided in these studies that the initiation on the domain C-lacking templates was actually accomplished by a 5' terminus-independent (i.e., internal) mode. Perhaps the strongest evidence that the integrity of the entire domain C is not essential for the internal initiation was provided by the observation that a construct retaining only nucleotides 320-631 from poliovirus 5-UTR (and hence no intact domain C) still proved to be capable of ensuring cap-independent internal ribosome binding . Thus, the apparent conflict of the data concerning the essentiality of domain C perhaps reflects not an entirely uncommon situation in which certain damages to a biological structure are lethal, while its complete removal is not.

The fourth domain (D; positions 451-559 in poliovirus type 3 RNA) appears to perform a key role; its partial or complete destruction proved to be incompatible with the ability of the cis element to direct internal ribosome binding both in uiuo Trono et al., 1988b ; see also Dildine and Semler, 1989) and in uitro (Pelletier et al., 198813; Trono et al., 1988a; Pestova et al., 1989) .

The 5' border should certainly be placed downstream of the poly(C) tract, since the removal of this tract, together with the adjoining upstream sequence (so-called short, or S, segment), does not significantly alter the translation efficiency of the EMCV RNA to any significant degree Shih et al., 1987) . Moreover, a 5'4runcated segment of the EMCV 5-UTR containing about 480 (of 833) 5-UTR nucleotides confers a high template activity to the engineered templates (Parks et d., 1986; Krausslich et al., 1987 ; see also Elroy-Stein et al., 1989) . More detailed studies on EMCV RNA templates that were annealed with complementary oligodeoxyribonucleo-tides or were 5'-truncated (Shih et aZ., 1987) as well as on constructs containing partially deleted versions of EMCV 5-UTR (Jang et al., 1988; Jang and Wimmer, 19901 , while yielding somewhat deviating results, nevertheless permitted placement of the 5' border of the essential core of the cis element somewhere downstream of position 402, that is, approximately 430 nucleotides before the initiator AUG (position 834). In any case deletions up to nucleotide 421 completely abolished the translational activity of appropriate constructs (Jang and Wimmer, 1990 ). Thus, the 5' border of the control element coincides with a conserved hairpin-loop structure shown in Fig. 2 . There is convincing experimental evidence that the secondary structure of this locus is no less important than its primary structure (Jang and Wimmer, 1990 ). It should be noted that nonessential, though significant, portions of the control element could be revealed in a more upstream segment of the EMCV 5-UTR (e.g., around positions 373-392) (Jang and Wimmer, 1990) .",

Another theoretical argument against the possible involvement of the cap-dependent initiation system in the polyprotein synthesis is the inactivation of this system on poliovirus infection. Again, counterarguments can be put forward. First, the putative cap-dependent initiation could be imagined to occur at the very early stages of infection, prior to the inactivation of the cap-dependent factors. Second, there are examples of enterovirus infection in which no appreciable shut-off of the cellular protein synthesis could be registered due to viral mutations (Cooper, 1977; Bernstein et al., 1985) .

As already mentioned, the transfection of cultured cells with capped poliovirus RNA yielded less (rather than more) viral proteins compared with the uncapped species (Macejak et al., 1990) . The capping of transcripts containing the entire poliovirus 5-UTR did not appreciably affect, as compared with the uncapped templates, the efficiency of the expression of the adjacent reporter gene in extracts from either mock-or poliovirus-infected HeLa cells (Pelletier et al., 198813) . These facts should mean that the cap-dependent initiation of translation, if it occurs at all, could be responsible for only a negligible part of the overall protein synthesis directed by the intact poliovirus RNA. On deletions of specific segments of the 5-UTR, however, the cap dependence of translation increased markedly; it was especially pronounced with extensively truncated templates (e.g., those lacking the first 631 nucleotides); such truncated RNAs, however, could not serve as active templates in extracts from poliovirus-infected cells , in which the cap-dependent translation initiation system is inactivated (see Sec-tion V,B). These observations may be interpreted by postulating the existence of a negative cis-acting control element or, in other words, a n obstacle to ribosome scanning from the template 5' end to the initiator codon.",

The 80 S ribosomes are normally in equilibrium with their 40 S and 60 S subunits. To prevent association of the subunits, the smaller one should bind two initiation factors: a huge multicomponent factor eIF-3 and factor eIF-4C (the 60 S subunit may perhaps also be temporarily blocked by binding the initiator factor eIF-6). The second participant, the aminoacylated initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA,), should first form a ternary complex with factor eIF-2 and GTP. These two components, the ribosome subunit and the ternary complex, combine with one another to form a so-called 43 S initiation complex. Concurrently, the third participant, a n mRNA species, which is generally capped at its 5' end, interacts with the cap-recognizing factor, eIF-4E, which can be found in the cell both in a free form and in a complex with two other factors, eIF-4A and p220 (the complex of eIF-4E, eIF-4A, and p220 is called eIF-4F). It is believed that it is eIF-4F that actually interacts with mRNA in an ATP-dependent reaction. The next step is the interaction of the Met-tRNA,-charged 40 S ribosome subunit (the 43 S initiation complex) with the mRNA template associated with eIF-4F; this reac-tion also requires ATP and free eIF-4A as well as one more initiation factor, eIF-4B. Since eIF-4F as well as eIF-4A alone, and especially together with eIF-4B, exhibit RNA helicase properties (Ray et al., 1985; Lawson et al., 1989; Rozen et al., 1990, quoted by Sonenberg, 19901 , it was proposed that their function consists in unwinding mRNA secondary structure elements to permit ribosome \"landing,\" which is presumed to be RNA sequence unspecific and requiring merely a \"melted\" segment of the template (Sonenberg, 1988; Sonenberg and Pelletier, 1989) . The ribosome-template-Met-tRNAi-factors complex is called a 48 S initiation complex. At this stage a poorly understood process, the ATP-dependent movement (\"scanning\") of the ribosome subunit along the template ensues (Kozak, 1978 (Kozak, , 1989a ; it is not known whether the moving force for this process is provided by the ribosome itself or by initiation factors (e.g., the eIF-4A/eIF-4B helicase). The scanning continues until a n AUG in a favorable context is encountered. Here, the larger ribosomal subunit (60 S) is, with high probability, recruited to form the 80 S initiation complex in a reaction which requires GTP and one more initiation factor, eIF-5, and is accompanied by the release of an eIF-2-GDP complex, as well as eIF-3, eIF-4C, eIF-5, and probably some other initiation factors. This is the end of the initiation step and the beginning of the elongation step.",

In fact, this problem concerns primarily factor eIF-2, because it is released from the 80 S initiation complex in a form stably bound to GDP and is therefore unable to enter a new initiation cycle. eIF-2-GDP could be converted into a reusable species through an interaction with factor eIF-2B (known also as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GEF) and GTP, whereby the nucleotide moiety in eIF-2-GTP is eventually regenerated. A powerful and widespread tool to regulate translation initiation consists of simply inhibiting the eIF-2 recycling by phosphorylation of its (Y subunit, which can be accomplished by a variety of protein kinases. The phosphorylated form of eIF-2 is, in turn, a potent inhibitor of the eIF-2B activity. The complex and physiologically important controls involving the eIF-2 system have recently been the subject of several reviews (Kaempfer, 1984; London et al., 1987; Gupta et al., 1987; Hershey, 1989; Sarre, 1989 ).",

In fact, they could not be expected to be the same in at least one respect. Due to the lack of a cap structure, picornaviral RNAs could hardly be expected to need the cap-recognizing factors eIF-4E and eIF-4F. They do not. Moreover, the p220 subunit of eIF-4F is degraded on enterovirus (Etchison et al., 1982; Lee et al., 1985; Buckley and Ehrenfeld, 1987) , rhinovirus (Etchison and Fout, 19851, and aphthovirus (Lloyd et al., 1988; Devaney et al., 1988) [but not cardiovirus (Mosenkis et al., 1985; Lloyd et al., 1988) l infections, rendering the host cell protein-synthesizing machinery unable to efficiently initiate translation of capped mRNAs, while retaining, if not increasing, the capacity to utilize uncapped picornaviral templates (Kaufmann et al., 1976; Helentjaris and Ehrenfeld, 1978; Rose et al., 1978; reviewed by Ehrenfeld, 1984; Kozak, 1986d; Sonenberg, 1987) . The diminished ability of cell extracts from poliovirus-infected cells to translate capped mRNA species can be restored on the addition of eIF-4F preparations (Tahara et al., 1981; Grifo et al., 1983; Etchison et al., 1984; Edery et al., 19841 , supporting the theory that it is the deficiency in this factor that is responsible, at least partially, for the virus-induced shut-off of the host protein synthesis. Importantly, no evidence for poliovirus infection-induced alterations of other constituents of eIF-4F, either eIF-4A or eIF-4E, nor of another participant of the RNA-ribosome interaction, eIF-4B, was found (Helentjaris et al., 1979; Duncan et al., 1983; Etchison et al., 1984; Lee et al., 1985; Buckley and Ehrenfeld, 1986) . Since poliovirus mutants unable to induce efficient inactivation of eIF-4F, being viable, grow relatively poorly (Bernstein et al., 1985) , it seems likely that the inhibition of the capdependent initiation machinery is beneficial for the virus because it eliminates competition with other templates.",

This observation may suggest that relatively little work would be done by the ATP-consuming enzymes (e.g., eIF-4AIeIF-4B helicase or whatever entity is involved in the ribosome scanning) during the translation initiation on the cardiovirus template. On the other hand, a high requirement for eIF-4A was reported for the initiation of poliovirus polyprotein (Daniels- Mc-Queen et al., 1983) . If there actually is a difference in the eIF-4A requirement for the poliovirus and EMCV RNA translation, it is tempting to relate it to a longer distance that a 40 S ribosome has perhaps to cover (i.e., scan) between the entry site and the initiator AUG on the former template (see Section VI). [In considering the validity of these speculations, one should take into account, however, that Blair et al. (1977) reported quite the opposite results; according to their data, eIF-4A markedly stimulated the in uitm translation of EMCV, mengovirus, and FMDV RNAs, but not that of poliovirus.]",

            "text": "The next part of our discussion concerns a specific role, if any, of eIF-2 in the initiation of picornaviral polyprotein synthesis. The problem has several facets. One was set forth by R. Kaempfer and associ- ates, who proposed that eIF-2, in addition to its canonical function in guiding Met-tRNA, to ribosomes, promotes ribosome binding to certain templates, particularly to cardiovirus (mengovirus) RNA, and probably takes part in the selection of proper AUGs as well (reviewed by Kaempfer, 1984) . These proposals were based on several considerations. (1) eIF-2 was claimed to bind, with high affinity, to the neighborhood of the initiator AUG, for example, in the satellite tobacco necrosis virus RNA (which is a naturally uncapped template) (Kaempfer et al., 1981) and to mengovirus RNA (Perez-Bercoff and ; the loci of specific eIF-2 and ribosome binding appeared to overlap on these templates. (2) The addition of exogenous eIF-2 was reported to affect the competition between mRNAs with different template activities, such as a-and @globin mRNAs or globin mRNA and mengovirus RNA, in a manner that could be interpreted to suggest that these RNAs competed for eIF-2 (Di Segni et al., Rosen et al., 1982) . It should be noted that these ideas generally have been met with a great deal of skepticism, but we would consider it unwise to disregard them, especially in light of some recent observations. Thus, a mutational alteration in the eIF-2 p subunit led to a remarkable change in yeast's ability to choose the start codon; the mutant could now begin translation of a specific template from a UUG introduced in place of the genuine AUG (Donahue et al., 1988) . The ability of eIF-2 to affect the choice of initiator AUGs by the translational apparatus of rabbit reticulocytes hae aleo been reported (Dasso et al., 1990) .",

There is evidence that enhanced phosphorylation of the a subunit of eIF-2 accompanies poliovirus infection (Black et al., 1989; O'Neill and Racaniello, 1989) , the enhancement being due to the self-phosphorylation and concomitant activation of a protein kinase induced by the accumulating poliovirus-specific doublestranded RNA (the same double-stranded RNA-stimulated kinase as that activated by interferon). Interestingly, the overall activity of this kinase in the infected cells was increased despite extensive degradation of the enzyme due to an unknown poliovirus-induced process (Black et al., 1989 ) (one may wonder whether a poliovirus-specific protease is involved in this degradation). A similar combination of the activation and degradation of the kinase takes place during the EMCV infection too (Hovanessian et al., 1987) . It seems likely that the phosphorylation-triggered partial inactivation of eIF-2 in the infected cells is related to the general inhibition of protein synthesis characteristic of the final steps of the reproduction cycle (O'Neill and .",

Inactivation of this factor provides an advantage for the virus-specific protein synthesis and furnishes additional evidence for its cap independence. Modulations of the activity of some other initiation factors, first of all eIF-2, and their possible physiological significance deserve further attention. There is no clear evidence that translation initiation on picornaviral templates exhibits an especially high specific requirement for certain initiation factors. It should be stressed, however, that thus far we have been dealing only with the generally recognized initiation factors, which have more or less characterized function(s). The possible involvement of novel factors in the translation initiation on picornaviral templates is discussed in the next section.",

It is a common approach to study the initiation factor requirements for translation of picornaviral mRNAs by using an artificial host system such as HeLa cells, or even such nonhost cells as rabbit reticulocytes. Evidence is accumulating, however, that properties of the translational machinery may vary in cells of different origin or differentiation status, and that such variation may markedly affect expression of the picornaviral genomes. Thus, translation of poliovirus RNA in human blood cells (L6pez-Guerrero et al., 1989) and neural cells (La Monica and Racaniello, 1989; Ago1 et al., 1989) appears to be relatively restricted. A likely reason for these disparities may consist of the different availability of initiation factors (see also Section 1x1.

            "text": "As a matter of fact, any cis-acting element can work only if it interacts with something else. In principle, this \"something else\" may be represented by another genomic cis element or a variety of molecules of different kinds, but the first thing that comes into mind on considering the activity of an mRNA translational cis element is naturally a protein \"factor.\" Several approaches have been pursued to identify novel factor(s) recognizing the translational cis-acting control element(s) in the middle of the picornaviral 5-UTR. Perhaps the first attempt of this kind was undertaken in our laboratory when we looked for a factor able to \"sense\" mutations modulating the cis element activity (Svitkin et al., 1988) . Our study was based on two lines of previous observations. First, Dorner et al. (1984) showed that, in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, poliovirus RNA was translated predominantly from \"aberrant\" sites located within the polyprotein coding region, although \"correct\" initiation at the beginning of this region also occurred to a lesser extent. As demonstrated first by Brown and Ehrenfeld (1979) and confirmed in other laboratories (Dorner et al., 1984; Svitkin et al., 1985;  Phillips and Emmert, 1986) , crude preparations of translation initiation factors from nucleated (e.g., HeLa or Krebs-2) cells could \"normalize\" the pattern of products directed by poliovirus RNA in reticulocyte lysates. Thus, an \"initiation correcting factor\" (ICF) should be present in the active fraction from nucleated cells, whereas reticulocyte lysates appear to be ICF deficient. Second, the correct initiation was shown to be especially weak when RNA templates from attenuated poliovirus strains (known to bear point mutations within the 472-480 region of the cis-acting control element; see Section IV,B) were translated in reticulocyte lysates (Svitkin et al., 1985) . We wondered, therefore, whether the poor template activity of the RNAs with mutations in the 472-480 region could be explained by their diminished responsiveness to ICF. In other words, we asked whether ICF could \"recognize\" mutations within the cis-acting control element. The answer was \"yes\": the initiation of viral polyprotein synthesis was stimulated by partially purified ICF preparations from Krebs-2 cells to a markedly greater extent when RNAs from virulent, compared with attenuated, poliovirus strains were used as templates. We inferred that ICF does interact with a region of the viral 5-UTR that encompasses mutations in the 472-480 region of poliovirus 5-UTR.",

While the meaning of the latter is more or less self-evident, the former consists of investigating the ability of different protein fractions to form complexes with RNA molecules, thereby diminishing the mobility of the latter on nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. In both cases the problem is to find a balance between two opposite requirements. On the one hand, the RNA fragment should be as short as possible, because this gives a relatively greater mobility shift on binding a protein, and, in UV cross-linking experiments, the sequence nonspecific binding will be minimized. On the other hand, the shortening of the fragment increases the chance that it will lose its original secondary and tertiary structures, and hence certain potential RNA-protein interactions would not be realized. This conflict of requirements is a real problem, especially since the length of the RNA fragment is often determined by the availability of convenient sites for restriction nucleases on appropriate plasmids, and since the secondary and especially tertiary structure of the RNA in question is rarely known.",

Two proteins, with M, values of 52K and lOOK (p62 and p100, respectively), have been identified as covalently linked to the 559-624 RNA segment after UV irradiation, but, on the basis of several controls, only the former was considered to be specifically bound.

The main conclusion emerging from these elegant experiments was that, given the presence of an intact upstream cis-acting control element, the initiation occurred almost exclusively at the correct AUG, with a striking disregard of even an AUG located less than 10 nucleotides upstream. This and the two more upstream ignored AUGs were by no means \"crippled\" ones, since they could ensure fairly efficient initiation, provided a significant portion of the preceding sequence was deleted, The invalidation of the cisacting control elements (both the positive and negative ones) rendered the mode of initiation fully conforming to Kozak's rules; the most 5'proximal AUG was not preferentially used, and the initiation was markedly stimulated on template capping.",

Nevertheless, scanning along a limited segment of poliovirus RNA adjacent to the initiator AUG seems to be substantiated by the following observations: (1) Insertion of an AUG-containing sequence downstream of position 702 resulted in the lowering of the growth potential of the mutant poliovirus (the appearance of sp phenotype) due most likely to the impairment of the viral protein synthesis; largeplaque revertants of this mutant invariably lacked the newly acquired AUG triplet (Kuge et al., 1989a,b) ; (2) insertion of a foreign reporter gene together with its own initiator AUG at position 630 of the POliovirus 5-UTR produced a template capable of directing in uitro the synthesis of the reporter protein in a manner indistinguishable from that characteristic of the synthesis of genuine poliovirus proteins ; and (3) insertion of a stable secondary structure element (thought to be an \"obstacle\" for ribosome scanning) at position 631 of poliovirus type 2-derived 5-UTR resulted in abrogation of the expression of the following ORF .",

As discussed in Section X, the poliovirus genome could well have originated from a \"rhinoviruslike\" ancestor by the acquisition of a n additional segment between the cis-acting translational control element and the polyprotein reading frame. In the rhinovirus type 2 genome the initiator AUG is located at position 611 (see Table I ) just in the conserved secondary structure element E (Fig. 1) . We propose that, in the case of entero-and rhinovirus RNAs, the ribosomes are fixed precisely near the AUG they \"expect\" to find at a proper place within this conserved element.

We propose that such multipoint ribosome-RNA interaction is a common, and important, feature of the mechanism of translation initiation on the picornaviral RNA (cf. Jang and Wimmer, 1990) .

However, there are few, if any, biochemical mechanisms exploited by only a single group of viruses. Moreover, the history of molecular biology teaches us that cellular counterparts could eventually be found for the overwhelming majority of mechanisms for the storage, replication, and expression of the genetic information that had been first discovered in viral systems and considered to be unique at that time. In this section I consider, above all, instances pertaining to the occurrence, among different viral and cellular templates, of such fundamental \"picornavirus-like\" properties as the capacity for internal ribosome binding, cap independence, and the possession of a negative cis-acting control element. In addition, I touch on the peculiarities of some mRNA species which point to other functional potentials of the long 5-UTRa with multiple AUGs. For convenience I discuss different picornavirus-like traits more or less separately; actually, they may join one another in various combinations.",

In this regard the case of the viral polymerase of a hepadnavirus, duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), should perhaps be mentioned first. The enzyme is translated from a functionally bicistronic 3.3-kb template, whose 5'-proximal and -distal cistrons encode, in two different ORFs, the core protein and polymerase, respectively. The cistrons overlap one another, and the 305-nucleotides overlap region contains two AUGs in the polymerase O W . Several lines of evidence ruled out the possibility that the synthesis of DHBV polymerase depended on the translation of the preceding cistron; in particular, the utilization of a frame-shifting mechanism was demonstrated to be highly unlikely (Schlicht et al., 1989;  L.J. . The internal initiation at the first AUG of the polymerase ORF was suggested by these authors to be the favored, and, in fact, the only feasible, explanation. Similar data were obtained with another hepadnavirus, human hepatitis B virus (JeanJean et al., 1989) .",

The simplest, but perhaps not the only, way to explain both these observations is to postulate that the synthesis of 7K is initiated by internally bound ribosomes. A peculiar case of internal initiation of translation was suggested to explain the synthesis of the so-called X protein of another negativestrand RNA virus, paramyxovirus Sendai virus (Curran and Kolakofsky, 1988) . Similar to the previous example, this protein corresponds to a carboxy-terminal portion of a much larger viral polypeptide, protein P, and the former does not seem to be a proteolytic product of the latter. Accumulation of X, in in uitm hybrid-arrest translation experiments, also could be demonstrated under conditions excluding synthesis of P, consistent with an internal mode of initiation. The peculiarity of this initiation and its apparent distinction from the VSV case, however, is its sensitivity to cap analogs, suggesting the involvement of the template 5' terminus (Curran and Kolakofsky, 1988) .",

According to one explanation, eIF-4F is needed to stimulate the eIF-4A/ eIF-4B-promoted unwinding of an RNA region (cf. Abramson et al., 1988) to prepare the internal ribosome binding locus near the X polypeptide initiation site; the novel suggestion is that eIF-4F should reach this region only by initial binding to the 5'-terminal cap structure followed by the movement along the template (i.e., by a process similar to the ribosome scanning). The other explanation implies that ribosomes do begin their scanning along the template from the 5' end, but, with some probability, they could skip (i.e., \"jump over\") an RNA segment; this hypothesis is supported by a case in which a similar ability of prokaryotic ribosomes has been well documented (Huang et al., 1988) . In considering these hypotheses, one should take into ac-count, however, that the inhibition by cap analogs could be observed even with a cap-lacking template [e.g., satellite tobacco necrosis virus RNA (Smith and Clark, 197911 , indicating that the competition with a genuine cap is not the exclusive mode of the inhibitory effect of cap analogs.",

The leader has no upstream AUGs and contains a cis-acting control element ensuring translational activation late, but not early, in infection (Logan and Shenk, 1984) . This element permitted efficient translation of appropriate adenovirus mRNA species in poliovirus-infected cells (Castrillo and Carrasco, 1987; Dolph et al., 1988; Jang et al., 19891, suggesting that its function is independent of the cap-binding protein factors. The proposed explanation for this property is based on the determination of the leader's secondary structure; since it contains two apparently unpaired regions, it could simply bind factors eIF-4A and eIF-4B in a capindependent manner, and the helicase activity of these factors would prepare a single-stranded landing pad of a sufficient length to secure internal binding of ribosomes (Zhang et al., 1989) . This explanation, which is in line with the popular view that the major function of the cap-dependent machinery is to promote melting of the mRNA secondary structure Sonenberg, 1988) , may, however, be incomplete, because it fails to take into account that the tripartite leader appears to activate translation during late, but not early, stages of the adenovirus reproduction cycle. The involvement of transacting factors whose concentration or activity would be changed on infection seems, therefore, quite likely.

The myc 5-UTR contains a negative translational control element, as judged by a significant increase in the myc mRNA template activity on its 5' truncation (Darveau et al., 1985) , and it was proposed that the activation of Myc protein synthesis (and concomitant tumorigenesis) on the translocation of a portion of the myc gene into a different genetic background (e.g., as in Burkitt's lymphomas) may result, at least in part, from the removal of this element (Saito et al., 1983) .",

These authors propose that a sequence to the 3' side of the URF4 promotes ribosome conversion into a form unable to reinitiate at the downstream, bona fide, GCN4 initiation codon. On the other hand, on completing translation of the first URF, ribosomes retain, if not increase, the ability for further scanning of the template and for the efficient reinitiation at the next AUG.

These factors include, among others, products of negative (GCDI gene) as well as positive (GCN2 and GCN3) regulators. Under good nutrition conditions the GCDl gene is active and its product somehow ensures that ribosomes, on completing their working cycles (initiation, reading, and termination), first at the upstream and then at the downstream URFs, severely diminish their ability to reinitiate at the GCN4 ORF [this notion primarily stems from the observation that GCDl mutants efficiently synthesize the GCN4 protein constitutively (see Hinnebusch, 1985) l. Amino acid deficiency, however, stimulates certain GCN genes [in particular, GCN2, which contains a protein kinase domain (Roussou et al., 1988 ) and a domain closely related to histidyl-tRNA synthetase (Wek et al., 1989) , as well as GCN3 (Hannig and Hinnebusch, 1988) 1, and this stimulation in turn results in abrogation of the activities of the negative elements (the GCDl protein and/or the downstream URFs), accompanied by a dramatic increase in the reinitiating capacity of the ribosomes and hence in the GCN4 mRNA translatability (Tzamarias and Thireos, 1988) . Hypothetical models explaining the complex interaction of the diverse cis-and trans-acting elements involved, possibly including modulation of the eIF-2 activity, have recently been put forward (Tzamarias et al., 1989; Hinnebusch, 1990) .",

Ferritin, a ubiquitous intracellular iron storage protein, is composed of multiple copies of two subunits, light (L) and heavy (H). Ferritin synthesis is controlled posttranscriptionally, with iron deficiency resulting in the decreased translatability of both L and H ferritin mRNA species (reviewed by Theil, 1987) . The cis-acting iron-responsive control element was traced to relatively long (i.e., around 200-bp) 5-UTRs of these mRNAs, particularly to their highly conserved stem-loop structure just below 30 bp in length (Hentze et al., 1987; Aziz and Munro, 1987; Rouault et al., 1988) .

The removal of over 100 5'4erminal nucleotides resulted in the loss of viability (Racaniello and Baltimore, 19811, most likely because of an RNA replication defect. Deeper insights came from more subtle interventions in the 5-UTRs structure. Racaniello and Meriam (1986) , while constructing different poliovirus cDNA clones, isolated a mutant of the type 1 virus lacking nucleotide 10. In the original genome C,, is expected to interact with Gs4, forming the lowest base pair in a 9-bp stem of a hairpin (Larsen et al., 19811, so this stem should be truncated in the mutant RNA. The C,,-lacking mutant exhibited a ts and sp phenotype, was deficient in the synthesis of both positive and negative RNA strands at a nonpermissive temperature, and demonstrated somewhat retarded virus-specific protein synthesis at any temperature (Rancaniello and Meriam, 1986) . Most likely, the primary lesion in the mutant reproduction was in the viral RNA replication. Several t s + pseudorevertants have been isolated from the mutant virus stock, and they invariably retained the original mutation (loss of C,,), but all acquired a second-site mutation, Gs4+U. Notably, this second-site mutation could be envisioned to restore the original length of the hairpin stem, if the formation of a G,-U,, base pair were postulated . Other independent evidence also appears to suggest an important functional role for the secondary structure, not merely the nucleotide sequence (R. Andino, personal communication) .",

These mutations perhaps impair and restore, respectively, an important cis-acting replication signal. The nature of the compensating mutation suggests that this signal may be related to a secondary structure element. If this suggestion is correct, we would think that the signal is located in the positive, rather than negative, strand, since no restoration of the stem could be expected in the negative strand (the relevant positions are occupied by C and A residues) . How a secondary structure element in the vicinity of the 5' end of the positive RNA strand can affect the replication process remains entirely unclear. Alternatively, the effect of mutations may be attributed to alterations in the primary, rather than secondary, structure of the RNA templates (be they of positive or negative polarity or even double-stranded). In this case, also, no obvious explanation for the relationship between mutations at positions 10 and 34 could be proposed.",

There is a very convenient KpnI restriction endonuclease site near position 70 of the poliovirus cDNA. This site corresponds to the second (fiom the 5' end), imperfect, hairpin of the viral RNA, encompassing nucleotides 51-78 (cf. Rivera et al., 1988) . There is strong evidence that the secondary, rather than primary, structure of this element is important for efficient genome replication (R. Andino, personal communication). A 4-bp deletion (expected to nearly destroy the element) resulted in the loss of viral viability (Kuge and Nomoto, 19871 , whereas a 4-bp insertion at the same site (leading merely to an enlargement of the loop) produced a mutant with ts and sp phenotypes as well as a severe lesion in viral RNA synthesis (Trono et al., 1988a) . Viruses with an incomplete reversion to the w t phenotype (i.e., partially restoring the ability to synthesize RNA and produce progeny at 37\u00b0C) could readily be selected from the mutant population; remarkably, independent clones of these \"revertants\" retained the original mutation (i.e., the insertion at position 70) (Andino et al., 1990) . Surprisingly, the suppressing mutations in the pseudorevertant genomes mapped to the sequence encoding polypeptide 3C, a viral protease. Although the suppressors appeared to be active only in cis, an analysis of the phenotypic expression of several site-directed mutations in the 3C gene led Andino et al. to the conclusion that the polypeptide itself, rather than RNA, was responsible for the suppression. If so, then one could postulate that the 3C polypeptide interacts with a hairpin in the poliovirus 5-UTR and that this interaction is involved in the viral genome replication (Andino et al., 1990) .",

As we shall see, this problem is directly related to certain facets of viral pathogenesis and cell differentiation. Involvement of the poliovirus 5-UTR in determining the level of viral neurovirulence could first be suspected when the primary structure differences in this segment of the genomes of attenuated (Sabin) strains and their neurovirulent counterparts belonging to either type 1 (Nomoto et al., 1982) or type 3 (Stanway et al., 1984a) had been detected. This suspicion was greatly reinforced by the discovery that reversion to neurovirulence of the Sabin type 3 vaccine strain was often accompanied by a back mutation in position 472 (Cann et al., 1984; Evans et al., 1985) ; thus, the neurovirulent parent and revertants have a C residue at this position, whereas the attenuated strain has a U residue there. Further experiments with engineered genomes composed of segment derived from attenuated and neurovirulent strains have established unambiguously that the attenuated phenotype of the Sabin type 1 (Kawamura et al., 19891 , type 2 (Moss et al., 19891, and type 3 (Westrop et al., 1989) strains is partly due to peculiarities of their 5-UTRs, particularly the segment encompassing nucleotides 472-481 (reviewed by Almond, 1987; Nomoto and Wimmer, 1987; Racaniello, 1988; Agol, 1988) .3 Furthermore, different arbitrary alterations of this segment resulted in significant changes in the level of viral neurovirulence .",

A natural question then arises as to why this translation defect should be tissue specific? Although the exact answer is unknown, a possible clue is provided by the observation that translation initiation factor eIF-2 seems to be involved, directly or otherwise, in the interaction with the cis-acting control element (Svitkin et al., 1988; del Angel et al., 1989 ; see also Section V). Since the eIF-2 system is known to be subject to diverse controls (London et al., 1987; Hershey, 1989) , it could well be imagined that its activity is dependent on the status of cell differentiation. Therefore, the apparently extraordinary sensitivity of neural cells to attenuating mutations in the 5-UTR control element seems, in general, to be understandable and, in fact, has been predicted (Svitkin et al., 1985 (Svitkin et al., , 1988 Agol, 1988) . Moreover, it could be suggested that the ability of even wild-type poliovirus strains to cause a paralytic disease in only a minute proportion of infected nonimmune humans (Melnick, 1985) could partly be due to physiological or pathological alterations of the translation machinery in their central nervous systems (Agol, 1988 (Agol, , 1990 .",

Although a later study by another group failed to reveal a simple correlation between FMDV pathogenicity and poly(C) length (Costa Giomi et al., 19841 , this group did detect an apparent contribution of the homopolymeric tract length to the reproductive capacity of the virus in the organism (Costa Giomi et al., 1988) . Indeed, these authors noted that strains having a longer poly(C) tract had been selected for on chronic infection of steers, though at late stages shortening of the originally long poly(C) was also observed. Mixed infection experiments with the two FMDV isolates differing from each other with respect to the poly(C) length demonstrated that the strain with a longer poly(C) had a selective growth advantage (Costa Giomi et al., 1988) .",

On the one hand, the efforts of numerous research groups appear to be fairly rewarded, and the field, which was discovered only a decade ago, can undoubtedly be regarded as one of the most advanced areas of molecular virology. It gives insights not only into the mechanisms of viral reproduction and behavior, but also into the working abilities of the eukaryotic translational machinery in general. On the other hand, the understanding, in molecular terms, of the activities of the translational and replicational cis-acting elements within the picornaviral 5-UTRa is yet to come. Among the questions most urgently awaiting adequate answers, I would list the following.",
