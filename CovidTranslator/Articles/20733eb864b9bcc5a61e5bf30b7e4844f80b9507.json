In this study, we report on the activation of TORC1 through MEKK1-mediated phosphorylation.

            "text": "In addition to induced phosphorylation at S133, CREB activity can also be regulated through a new family of transcriptional coactivators, termed transducers of regulated CREB activity (TORCs; Conkright et al., 2003; Iourgenko et al., 2003) . Three members named TORC1, TORC2, and TORC3 have been found in this family. All three TORCs activate CREB-dependent transcription, but are differentially expressed in different tissues and cells (Conkright et al., 2003) . TORCs represent a critical regulatory point in a complex network of signals (Bittinger et al., 2004; Sceraton et al., 2004; Koo et al., 2005; Shaw et al., 2005; Katoh et al., 2006) . In one model for the regulation of TORC activity, tumor suppressor protein LKB1, which is frequently inactivated in the cancer-predisposing Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (Alessi et al., 2006) , can phosphorylate and activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The AMPK kinases then phosphorylate TORCs, leading to inhibition of O-glycosylation, binding with 14-3-3 proteins, sequestration in the cytoplasm, and prevention of transcriptional activation (Takemori et al., 2007a; Dentin et al., 2008) . It is noteworthy that S171-phosphorylated TORC2 retained in the cytoplasm undergoes polyubiquitination at K628 followed by proteosome-dependent degradation (Dentin et al., 2007) . In addition, other secondary messengers such as calcium and cAMP can also regulate TORC activity (Screaton et al., 2004; Ohmae et al., 2006; Amelio et al., 2007) . While dephosphorylation of TORC2 at S171 and S275 is induced by a calcium-activated phosphatase known as calcineurin (Jansson et al., 2008) , cAMP stimulates protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of an AMPK-related kinase termed salk-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) at S587, leading to its inhibition and subsequent activation of TORCs (Screaton et al., 2004) .",

TORCs and p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) activate transcription through different mechanisms, but they also synergize with each other (Ravnskjaer et al., 2007) . While phosphorylation of CREB at S133 promotes the recruitment of p300/CBP but not TORCs, TORCs enhance the association of CREB with TAF II 130 independent of S133 phosphorylation (Conkright et al., 2003) .

            "text": "The physiological and pathological roles of TORC coactivators have been demonstrated in different contexts. First, TORC2 is a key regulator of cell metabolism. It is a sensor of glucose and modulates gluconeogenesis and insulin signaling (Canettieri et al., 2005; Koo et al., 2005; Dentin et al., 2007 Dentin et al., , 2008 . TORCs are also transcriptional activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u2425 coactivator 1\u2423 (PGC1\u2423), which regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism , and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), a mitochondrial protein that trans-fers cholesterol (Takemori et al., 2007b) . In addition, TORC2 coordinates glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)-induced expression of antiapoptotic BCL2 gene (Kim et al., 2008) . Second, TORC2 regulates the normal program of germinal center gene activation and repression to promote Bcell development (Kuraishy et al., 2007) . Third, TORC1 is required for late-phase long-term synaptic potentiation in the hippocampus (Zhou et al., 2006; Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2007) . Finally, TORCs are critically involved in tumorigenesis (Siu and Jin, 2007) . TORC1-MAML2 is a fusion oncoprotein found in malignant salivary gland tumor and promotes oncogenesis through activating CREB and its target genes (Coxon et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2005) . TORCs are also essential coactivator of the Tax oncoprotein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) in the activation of viral long-terminal repeats (Koga et al., 2004; Siu et al., 2006) , and this coactivation is inhibited by BCL3 (Hishiki et al., 2007) . Suffice it to say, TORC coactivators are important regulators of CREB relevant to many biological systems and human diseases.",

MAPKs are evolutionarily conserved kinases that link extracellular signals ultimately to nuclear transcriptional machinery. MAPK modules generally comprise of three tiers in which a specific MAPK is regulated by a MAPK kinase (MAP2K), which in turn is activated by a MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K; Turjanski et al., 2007) . Mitogen-activated/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) is a MAP3K that regulates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) as well as other kinases including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), p38, and IB kinases (IKK; Cuevas et al., 2007) . MEKK1 contains a large N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain . The cleavage of MEKK1 at D874 releases the active kinase domain, resulting in constitutive activation of the kinase (Gibson et al., 1999) . MEKK1 is a known regulator of several transcriptional activators and coactivators such as c-Myc, c-Jun, p53, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u2424 (C/EBP\u2424), silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), and p300 (Fuchs et al., 1998; Hong and Privalsky, 2000; See et al., 2001; Alarcon-Vargas et al., 2002; Roy et al., 2002; Xia et al., 2007) .",

The mechanism of MEKK1-induced activation of TORC1 was further investigated. We demonstrated the ability of MEKK1 to induce phosphorylation of TORC1, which does not occur at S167 equivalent to S171 of TORC2. In addition, we found that the expression of MEKK1 caused nuclear translocation of TORC1, followed by its recruitment to the cAMP response element (CRE) in the promoter region. Our work suggests a new signaling pathway for the activation of TORCs and CREB.",

In HeLa cells where the level of endogenous TORCs was low (Conkright et al., 2003) , the expression of MEKK1 alone, when compared with that of TORC1, did not significantly activate CRE-driven transcription ( Figure 1 ; groups 1-4 compared with group 5). In contrast, when TORC1 and MEKK1 were coexpressed, MEKK1 induced moderate and dose-dependent enhancement of TORC1 activity on CRE ( Figure 1A ; groups 5-8). Because MEKK1 is a MAP3K, we next investigated the requirement of the kinase activity for the activation of TORC1 by using two forms of MEKK1. First, we used constitutively active MEKK-C that contains the catalytic domain only. More than 10-fold stimulation of Figure 1 . Activation of TORC1 transcriptional activity by MEKK1. HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. All groups received reporter constructs pCRE-Luc and pSV-RLuc. TORC1 (A-C) or TORC1 S167A (D-F) expression plasmid was also introduced into cells in groups 5-8. The amounts of expression vector for full-length MEKK1 (A and D), MEKK-C (B and E), and MEKK1 D1369A (C and F) were progressively increased as indicated. Relative luciferase activity (RLA) represents firefly luciferase activity recovered form pCRE-Luc normalized to Renilla luciferase activity recovered from pSV-RLuc. Results represent three independent experiments; error bars, SDs. TORC1 transcriptional activity by MEKK-C ( Figure 1B ; groups 5-8) suggested that the activation of TORC1 was likely triggered by an MEKK1-induced phosphorylation event. Similar findings were also obtained from HEK293 cells (Supplemental Figure S1 ; groups 5-8), indicating that MEKK1-dependent activation of TORC1 occurred in different types of cells. Second, we exploited MEKK1 D1369A, a kinase-dead mutant of MEKK1 . The inability of MEKK1 D1369A to stimulate TORC1-mediated transcription ( Figure 1C , groups 5-8) lent further support to the notion that MEKK1-induced phosphorylation mediates the activation of TORC1.",

To prevent nonspecific effect on the CRE, we tethered TORC1 to the promoter through Gal4 DNA-binding domain and stimulated with MEKK-C. In this setting, an approximately twofold activation of GalTORC1 by MEKK-C was observed ( Figure 2D , groups 1-4). However, neither the basal activity of GalTORC1 nor the stimulation by MEKK-C was significantly affected by U0126, SP600125, or SB203580 ( Figure 2D , groups 5-8, 9 -12, and 13-16).

We overexpressed TORC1 and MEKK1 in HeLa cells and monitored the status of TORC1 proteins by Western blotting. While a doublet TORC1 band was observed in the lysate of cells expressing TORC1 alone ( Figure  3, A and B; lane 1) , expression of MEKK1 or dominant active MEKK-C resulted in the accumulation of the slow-migrating TORC1 species (Figure 3, A and B; lane 2) . To verify that the slow-migrating band represents hyperphosphorylated form of TORC1 (pTORC1), we treated the protein samples with AP before SDS-PAGE analysis. Disappearance of the slow-migrating band and emergence of the fast-migrating species in the presence of AP indicated that TORC1 was indeed phosphorylated upon expression of MEKK1 or MEKK-C (Figure 3, A and B, lane 3) . In contrast, no alteration of the doublet TORC1 band pattern was appreciated when the kinase-deficient mutant MEKK1 D1369A was expressed ( Figure 3C ). Additionally, similar results were also obtained from HEK293 cells (Supplemental Figure S3) . Thus, the kinase activity of MEKK1 was required for phosphorylation of TORC1.",

We first confirmed that the expression of luciferase reporter driven by IL-8 promoter was activated by TORC1 (Figure 8 , A-C, group 5 compared with group 1). Furthermore, this activation was dependent on the CRE because disruption of CRE suppressed the response to TORC1 almost completely (Figure 8 , D--F, group 5 compared with group 1). The expression of MEKK1 or MEKK-C alone also activated the transcription from IL-8 promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 8 , A and B, group 2-4 compared with group 1). The activation by MEKK1 was substantially inhibited but not completely abolished when the CRE in the IL-8 promoter was disrupted (Figure 8 , D and E, group 2-4 compared with group 1). Importantly, coexpression of MEKK1 or MEKK-C with TORC1 significantly enhanced transcriptional activity of TORC1 on IL-8 promoter (Figure 8 , A-B, group 6 -8 compared with group 5). The activity of MEKK1, MEKK-C, and TORC1 was substantially reduced on the CRE-deficient IL-8 promoter (Figure 8 , D and E, group 6 -8 compared with group 5). In addition, the kinase-dead mutant MEKK1 D1369A was unable to activate IL-8 promoter significantly (Figure 8 , C and F).

A similar construct was made and we noted that the N-terminal 152 residues of TORC1 fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domain (i.e., GalM1 or GM1) had a more potent interfering activity on TORC1 (Supplemental Figure S6 , B compared with A). When this GalM1 mutant was expressed in HeLa cells, in which TORC1 is a major TORC coactivator (data not shown), the activation of IL-8 promoter by MEKK1 or MEKK-C was inhibited almost completely (Figure 8, G and  H) . Thus, endogenous TORC1 was critically involved in MEKK1-induced activation of IL-8 promoter.",

This prompted us to investigate whether IL-1\u2423 activates IL-8 production through TORC1 and MEKK1. However, the activation of IL-8 production by IL-1\u2423 is a rapid process that could not be accurately reflected by luciferase reporter assay. In addition, it would be desirable to measure the activation of endogenous IL-8 gene. Thus, we used semiquantitative RT-PCR to monitor the change of IL-8 transcript in response to treatment with IL-1\u2423 in HeLa cells ( Figure 9A ). Consistent with previous findings (Larsen et al., 1989) , activation of IL-8 transcription by IL-1\u2423 peaked at 1 h after treatment and diminished at later time points ( Figure 9A , lanes 3-5 compared with lane 2). Although expression of an irrelevant shRNA (shGFP) did not influence the induction of IL-8 transcript by IL-1\u2423 ( Figure 9A , lane 7 compared with lanes 2 and 6), prior expression of shTORC1a and shTORC1b, two independent shRNAs that were specific and effective in suppressing the expression of TORC1 mRNA (Siu et al., 2006 and Supplemental Figure S7 ), led to a significant reduction in the steady-state amount of endogenous IL-8 transcript in HeLa cells ( Figure 9A , lanes 8 and 9 compared with lanes 6 and 7). In contrast, neither shTORC1a nor shTORC1b had any influence on the expression of the irrelevant GAPDH transcript.",

Indeed, an approximately twofold elevation of phosphorylated TORC1 was found at 60 min after treatment with IL-1\u2423 ( Figure 9C , lane 4 compared with lanes 1-3). Importantly, phosphorylation of TORC1 S167A mutant could also be induced by IL-1\u2423 ( Figure 9C, lanes 5-8) , suggesting that the phosphorylation of TORC1 could be mediated by MEKK1. Because the CMV promoter used to drive TORC1 expression could also be stimulated by MEKK1 (Bruening et al., 1998) , we also compared the levels of TORC1 transcript in untreated and IL-1\u2423-treated transfected cells by semiquantitative and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. We did not notice a significant change within 1 h after treatment (Supplemental Figure S8 ). In addition, similar results were also obtained when the expression of TORC1 was driven by the SV40 promoter and enhancer (data not shown).

Activation of TORC1 by MEKK1 was not mediated through PKA or calcineurin ( Figure 2) . Instead, MEKK1 physically associated with TORC1 ( Figure 5) , and the kinase activity of MEKK1 sufficiently induced TORC1 phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo (Figures 3 and 4) . Mechanistically, MEKK1-induced phosphorylation of TORC1 in the 220-residue C-terminal activation domain (Figure 7 ) promoted nuclear translocation of TORC1 and its subsequent recruitment to CRE promoters (Figures 6 and 9 ). Importantly, we provided the first evidence for the operation of this MEKK1-TORC1 signaling pathway in the physiological activation of IL-8 promoter by IL-1\u2423 (Figures 8 and 9 ). Although our findings were made with TORC1, similar results were also obtained in experiments conducted with TORC2 and TORC3 (data not shown). Thus, our work reveals a general mechanism for the regulation of TORC activity.",

One well-characterized signaling pathway for regulation of TORC activity involves LKB-AMPK kinases and targets TORCs for posttranslational modifications such as O-linked glycosylation and polyubiquitination (Screaton et al., 2004; Dentin et al., 2007 Dentin et al., , 2008 . The phosphorylation of TORC1 by AMPK is thought to take place at S167 equivalent to S171 of TORC2 (Screaton et al., 2004) . However, our various experiments performed with TORC1 and TORC1 S167A yielded essentially the same results (Figures 1, 4 , 8, and 9, and Supplemental Figures S2 and S4) , suggesting that what we described in this work could be independent of AMPK-mediated phosphorylation. Although our findings do not exclude the possibility for cross-talk between the two pathways, existing evidence does suggest that they respond to different stimuli and lead to opposite consequences. In contrast to AMPK kinases that are regulated by LKB1, AMP, and calcium (Takemori et al., 2007a) , MEKK1 is activated by IL-1\u2423 (Figure 9 ). More importantly, whereas AMPK-catalyzed phosphorylation of TORC1 at S167 caused sequestration of TORC1 in the cytoplasm and prevention of its transcriptional activity (Screaton et al., 2004) , MEKK1-induced phosphorylation of TORC1 in the C-terminal activation domain of 220 amino acids promoted nuclear translocation and its recruitment to CRE promoter (Figures 6, 7, and 9) .",

            "text": "While our work was under review, an independent study suggested a new mechanism for regulation of TORC2 activity by cAMP and glucose (Jansson et al., 2008) . In their model, TORC2 is inhibited by MARK2-catalyzed phosphorylation at S275 and activated by calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation at both S171 and S275. Although both their and our findings support the notion that S171 phosphorylation can insufficiently account for induced translocation and activation of TORC coactivators, it is noteworthy that the components and consequence of the two signaling pathways demonstrated in the two studies are still different. MARK2 is another AMPK-related kinase and MEKK1 is a MAP3K. Moreover, similar to phosphorylation at S171 by SIK2, phosphorylation of TORC2 at S275 by MARK2 sequesters the protein in the cytoplasm and therefore inhibits transcriptional activity. On the contrary, phosphorylation of TORC1 within the C-terminal region of 220 residues by MEKK1 leads to transcriptional activation (Figure 7) . Hence, these two pathways that control intracellular activity of TORC coactivators through phosphorylation at S167/S261 and another site within the C-terminal activation domain likely operate in different contexts and serve different physiological roles. Particularly, because various cellular targets of CREB differ in their requirement for TORCs (Ravnskjaer et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2007) , it is plausible that only a subset of CREB target genes are regulated by MEKK1.",

In addition, as a physiological stimulus of IL-8 production, IL-1\u2423 rapidly induced MEKK1-dependent phosphorylation of TORC1 and its subsequent recruitment to IL-8 promoter (Figure 9 ). IL-8 is a prototypic chemokine that plays pivotal roles in cytokine signaling, tumor progression, angiogenesis and tissue remodeling (Rossi and Zlotnik, 2000) . Because of its importance and inducibility, transcriptional activation of IL-8 promoter has been extensively studied (Hoffmann et al., 2002) . Nuclear factor B (NF-B) and AP1 are thought to be key regulators of IL-8 promoter (Yasumoto et al., 1992) . Plausibly, the activation of IL-8 promoter by MEKK1 in the absence of TORC1 overexpression (Figure 8, A and B ) was attributed at least in part to the stimulation of NF-B and AP1. Although a functional CRE has been identified in IL-8 promoter and its activation by TORCs have been shown (Iourgenko et al., 2003) , the physiological function of this CRE is not understood. In this regard, our findings that MEKK1 stimulates TORC1-dependent activation of IL-8 promoter and that IL-1\u2423 induces IL-8 transcription through phosphorylation and promoter recruitment of TORC1 reveal a new facet in the regulation of IL-8 gene expression. It will be of great interest to see whether other physiological and pathological inducers of IL-8 such as tumor necrosis factor \u2423 and Ras (Sparmann and Bar-Sagi, 2004 ) might also act through MEKK1 and TORCs. In addition, the cooperation of different activation pathways and transcription factors including NF-B, AP1, and CREB in the activation of IL-8 promoter also merits further investigations. Likewise, identification and characterization of additional CREB target genes that are regulated through MEKK1 and TORCs are much warranted.",

TORC1 is likely phosphorylated at multiple sites (Screaton et al., 2004; Jansson et al., 2008) and phosphorylation at any site is often substoichiometric. Hence, in future experiments it will be crucial to increase the yield of phosphorylated TORC1 upon stimulation with MEKK1 and to achieve a higher stoichiometry of MEKK1-induced phosphorylation.",

These data are also in agreement with the dominant active property of MEKK-C (Gibson et al., 1999) and the negative regulatory function of the N-terminal domain of MEKK1 Lu et al., 2002; Witowsky and Johnson, 2003) . However, we also noted that MEKK1 and MEKK-C exhibited comparable activity to induce phosphorylation of TORC1 as analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift of TORC1 proteins (Figures 3 and 4 , and Supplemental Figures S3 and S4) . Generally, luciferase reporter assays are highly sensitive and produce high-resolution quantitative data for comparison. In contrast, the analysis of phosphorylation by electrophoretic mobility shift might be less accurate and less quantitative. In light of this, it is not too surprising that a higher activity of MEKK-C in phosphorylating TORC1 was not observed when hyperphosphorylated TORC1 was analyzed by electrophoresis (Figures 3 and 4 , and Supplemental Figures S3 and S4) .",
