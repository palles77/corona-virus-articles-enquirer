Immuno-blotting revealed that interchain disulfide bonds might be formed between this protein and the spike protein. ELISA indicated that sera from SARS patients have significant positive reactions with synthesized peptides derived from the 3a protein. These results are concordant with that of a spike protein-derived peptide. A tendency exists for co-mutation between the 3a protein and the spike protein of SARS-CoV isolates, suggesting that the function of the 3a protein correlates with the spike protein. Taken together, the 3a protein might be tightly correlated to the spike protein in the SARS-CoV functions. The 3a protein may serve as a new clinical marker or drug target for SARS treatment.",

Members of the coronavirus family can be divided into three groups according to serologic properties. 1 Although an individual coronavirus naturally infects distinct animal hosts and causes particular diseases, the whole-genome sequencing of several coronaviruses such as avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), revealed similar genomic structure among these different coronaviruses. 2 -5 A novel coronavirus has recently been identified, which causes the latest worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) shows that its genomic organization is similar to that of other known coronaviruses. 6, 7 The genome of SARS-CoV is approximately 30 kb in size and has 14 open reading frames (ORFS). 6 -8 It looks easy to analyze the entire genome of coronaviruses, but their protein component identification has proven to be a difficult task. So far, only five types of structural proteins have been identified as members of the coronavirus family. 1 The spike (S) glycoprotein, together with small envelope (E) protein and membrane (M) glycoprotein, consist of the viral envelope, while the nucleocapsid (N) protein interacts with genomic RNA of the virus to form the viral nucleocapsid. 1 -9 In addition, a hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein has been found in the virion surface of some coronaviruses such as turkey coronavirus. 1 The analysis of mRNAs of SARS-CoV revealed many transcription units covering unknown ORFs of the genome. 6, 8, 10 Although some researchers speculated that these unknown ORFs encode nonstructural proteins, 6 there is no evidence to support this assumption.",

If these cysteine residues exist in one helix, they would be located in the same surface, suggesting that the 3a protein containing these cysteine residues is able to form interchain disulfide linkages with other viral structural proteins. Interestingly, comparison with S protein sequences of the coronavirus family also shows a cysteinerich region overlapping the junction of the membrane-spanning domain and the cytoplasmic tail, which is a conserved motif of spike proteins in all analyzed coronaviruses (see Figure 3 of Marra et al. 7 ). This feature is not seen in other known structural proteins of SARS-CoV.

To test this hypothesis, the crude virions were analyzed by immuno-blotting under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. A polyclonal antibody against a peptide (S2) derived from the sequence of S protein detected two bands around 210 kDa and 180 kDa under non-reducing conditions ( Figure  2B , lane 2 of left panel), whereas only one band corresponding to 180 kDa was detected under reducing conditions ( Figure 2B , lane 1 of left panel).

In order to further confirm the observations, the antibodies were stripped out from these blotted PVDF membranes, and then the membranes were re-probed by the exchange of the antibodies (S2 for 3a1 and 3a1 for S2, respectively). The same patterns were detected again (not shown). These results suggest that the 3a protein binds to the spike protein with the interchain disulfide bonds on the interior side of the viral envelope of SARS-CoV.

Therefore, we designate this locus as SNE (S neighbor E). In general, the SNE locus consists of one to three ORFs in different species of coronaviruses, which encodes putative proteins containing at least one predicted transmembrane region ( Figure 4A ). Figure 4A shows that only the genomes of SARS-CoV and PEDV have one complete ORF in the SNE locus, whereas the putative genes corresponding to ORF 3 in SNEs of five other coronaviruses are truncated and short ORFs are produced due to a mutation. However, if the entire sequence of the SNE locus was used for phylogenetic analysis, the topology of the resulting phylograms of SNE would be remarkably similar to that of S proteins ( Figure 4B ). 6, 7 In other words, the phylogenetic analysis of SNE sequences indicates that SARS-CoV is not closely related to any of the three known groups of coronaviruses, which is in agreement with the phylogenetic analyses of all other known structural proteins of SARS-CoV. 6,7 Figure 1 .

Recently, some evidence showed that the cysteine-rich domain of S protein was required for coronavirus-induced membrane fusion. 19, 20 The sequence analysis showed that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV has a similar cysteinerich region that is also located at the junction of the putative transmembrane and cytoplasmic region ( Figure 1 ).

The analysis on the SNE locus may provide some clues to answer this question, since the ORF gene encoding the 3a protein is located in this locus ( Figure 4) . First of all, the SNE locus exists widely in all three groups of coronavirus family besides SARS-CoV, which consists of one to three ORFs ( Figure 4 ). It is likely that the SNE locus in the primitive coronavirus has only one ORF, and many short ORFs within the SNE locus may be produced in different strains of coronaviruses due to high mutation rates in this locus during the evolutionary process. Based on complete genome comparison, phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV showed that SARS-CoV is closer to group 1 of coronaviruses, 21 which is in agreement with our phylogenetic tree of the SNE locus ( Figure 4B ). Since it was proposed that PEDV and H229E diverged later than TEGV from their common ancestor in the group 1 according to the analysis of SNE locus, 10 we speculate that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV evolved from the SNE locus of PEDV or a PEDV-like ancestor.",
