            "text": "To circumvent limitations of poor antigen presentation and immunogenicity of DNA vaccines that target induction of CD8 + T cell immunity, we have generated single chain MHC I trimers (MHC I SCTs) composed of a single polypeptide chain with a linear composition of antigenic peptide, \u03b22microglobulin, and heavy chain of a MHC class I molecule connected by flexible linkers. Because of its pre-assembled nature, the SCT presents enhanced expression and presentation of the antigenic peptide/MHC complexes at the cell surface. Furthermore, DNA vaccination with a plasmid DNA encoding an SCT incorporating an immunodominant viral epitope elicited protective CD8 + T cell responses against lethal virus infection. To extend these findings, here we tested the efficacy of SCT DNA vaccines against bacterial infections. In a mouse infection model of Listeria monocytogenes, the SCT DNA vaccine encoding H-2K d and the immunodominant peptide LLO 91-99 generated functional primary and memory peptide-specific CD8 + T cells that confer partial protection against L. monocytogenes infection. DNA immunization of K d /LLO 91-99 SCTs generated functional memory CD8 + T cells independently of CD4 + T cells, although the expression of cognate or non-cognate CD4 + helper T cell epitopes further enhanced the protective efficacy of SCTs. Our study further demonstrates that the SCT serves as a potent platform for DNA vaccines against various infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases. Most of the vaccines developed to date have focused on humoral immunity, i.e. production of antibodies for neutralizing viruses and toxins or opsonizing bacteria. However, there are many cases in which the antibody response is not sufficient to protect against pathogens. CD8 + T cells play a major role in controlling infection and disease progression in many infectious diseases. Upon infection, antigen-specific CD8 + T cells are generated and remove infected cells through their cytotoxic activity and/or release of cytokines that inhibit growth of the microbe or impair its ability to survive inside the cell. Ongoing computational and/or experimental approaches have identified antigenic epitopes in a vast number of pathogens and using the identified epitopes to induce CD8 + T cell immune responses has been an important strategy for successful vaccines [1, 2] . However, most immunization approaches with class I binding peptides have failed to induce CD8 + T cell responses strong enough to prevent disease. This failure has been attributed to the lack of CD4 + T cell help and/or difficulty in maintaining a sufficient level of antigen presentation required for CD8 + T cell activation. To circumvent these limitations, we have developed fully assembled MHC molecules that can be expressed as membrane-bound proteins on the cell surface, termed single chain trimers (SCTs) [3, 4] . SCTs are composed of an immunodominant peptide, \u03b22m, and MHC I heavy chain covalently linked by 15-20 amino acid flexible linkers. Because SCTs are expressed as a single polypeptide chain, they do not require peptide processing, or chaperone-assisted peptide loading in the ER. Furthermore, antigen presentation by the SCT bypasses the need to compete with an extensive pool of endogenous peptides for peptide loading.",

            "text": "SCTs are folded properly and T cells respond to SCTs comparably to native peptide/MHC I complexes [4] [5] [6] . Various human and mouse class Ia and Ib MHC molecules have been engineered with epitope peptides into SCTs and proven as useful tools to monitor and modulate immune responses [7] [8] [9] [10] . The potency of SCT DNA vaccines has been demonstrated in mouse tumor models and virus infection models [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . For example, mice vaccinated with DNA encoding a SCT of an immunodominant CTL epitope of human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV-16) E6 antigen and H-2K b were protected against a lethal challenge of E6-expressing TC-1 tumor cells [13] . Importantly, SCT-based DNA vaccines appeared more effective at generating CD8 + T cell immunity than subunit or epitope-only DNA vaccines even when targeted to the ER lumen, due to incorporation of a preprocessed and preloaded peptide [13, 14, 16] . Recently, in the study using HLA-A*0201 SCTs in a mouse model of West Nile virus infection, we demonstrated for the first time that SCT DNA vaccination induces protective T cell immunity against virus infection [15] . Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated the flexibility of the SCT platform by combining it with other strategies to enhance DNA vaccine potency. For example, SCTs were co-expressed with a universal CD4 + T helper cell epitope to stimulate T helper cells that resulted in enhanced CD8 + T cell responses and anti-tumor and anti-virus effects [15, 17] . This suggested that the SCT platform can be incorporated into a composite vaccine targeting multiple aspects of immunity against tumors and viruses and opened the possibility that SCT-based DNA vaccines may be applied to other infectious disease models.",

Listeria monocytogenes is a gram positive intracellular bacterium that can cause the human disease, listeriosis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. L. monocytogenes infects a broad range of hosts and mouse models of Listeria infection are often used to study the mammalian immune response to infection [18] . L. monocytogenes infection elicits a robust T cell response that clears the pathogen from infected mice and provides long-lasting immunity while humoral immunity provides only a small contribution to protect mice. CD8 + T cells play a more substantial role than CD4 + T cells in conferring long term protective immunity particularly in the BALB/c mouse model [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . In BALB/c infection, listeriolysin O is one of the most antigenic proteins secreted by L. monocytogenes and the LLO epitope (residues 91-99) restricted by H-2K d is the most immunodominant as detected by CD8 T cells [23] .",

            "text": "The ability to quickly and specifically eliminate recurring infections is a hallmark of immunological memory. Thus, the generation of quality memory CD8 + T cells is an appealing goal for vaccine design against a variety of infectious diseases. While the role of CD4 + T cell help in the generation of CD8 + T cell memory remains controversial, previous studies suggested that the inclusion of a CD4 + T cell epitope in SCT DNA vaccine enhances anti-tumor or -virus effects [15, 17] . However, in these previous studies, it was not reported whether CD4 + T cell responses were actually generated and whether primary or memory CD8 + T cell responses were affected. In this study, we tested whether CD4 + T cell help can improve the efficacy of SCT DNA vaccine by co-expressing CD4 + helper T cell epitopes with the SCT. For this purpose, we compared two known CD4 + helper T cell epitopes, a pan CD4 + T cell epitope and a well-known CD4 + T cell epitope of L. monocytogenes that binds to MHC class II I-A d , LLO 189-200. Regarding the specificity of CD4 + T cell help required for optimal generation and maintenance of memory CD8 + T cell responses, it has been proposed that both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are required to be specific for the same antigen [24, 25] . However, recently published data indicate that helper T cell function is not antigen specific and likely results through cytokines [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The discrepancy between the studies may result from using different experimental systems such as inflammatory or noninflammatory and/or different precursor frequencies of antigen specific CD8 + T cells. Thus, our study not only examined the role of CD4 + T cell help in SCT-induced memory immune responses, but also compared L. monocytogenes-specific vs. -nonspecific CD4 + T cell epitopes for their ability to help protective CD8 + T cell responses induced by SCT-based DNA vaccines.",

At 4 weeks after K d /LLO 91-99 or control SCT DNA vaccination by gene gun as described above, mice were infected intraperitoneally with a high dose of L. monocytogenes (2\u00d710 5 ). For controls, na\u00efve mice or mice that had been infected with a low dose of L. monocytogenes (10 3 ) for 4 weeks were also infected with a high dose of L. monocytogenes. Mice were sampled for growth of the L. monocytogenes in spleens and livers at 3 days after infection, since, during secondary infection, infected mice usually eliminate L. monocytogenes within 3-4 days [31, 32] . As shown is Fig. 2C , K d /LLO 91-99 SCT DNA vaccinated mice had one log lower bacterial counts (CFU, colony forming units) than control SCT vaccinated mice in both spleen and liver after challenge with L. monocytogenes. Control SCT DNA vaccinated mice had the same bacterial counts as untreated mice while mice immunized with a low dose of L. monocytogenes showed lower bacterial counts than K d /LLO 91-99 SCT DNA vaccinated mice. Thus, this result demonstrates that K d /LLO 91-99 SCT DNA vaccination can induce a protective immune response against L. monocytogenes infection. It should be noted that priming with live and not heat-killed bacteria is required for full protection [33] , thus explaining the potency of priming with a low dose of L. monocytogenes. Reduction of bacterial count by one log may not be striking but is a significant level of protection. In the previous studies of DNA vaccines against L. monocytogenes, bacterial count after L. monocytogenes infection was reduced by 1~2 logs by immunization with DNA encoding wild type or mutant LLO protein but only with an adjuvant and/or boost immunizations [34, 35] . In another study which used the codon-optimized DNA sequence of LLO 91-99, DNA immunization decreased bacterial count by about one log [36] . Thus, our result with SCT based vaccination is considerable in that it was done with a single epitope without adjuvants or boost immunizations. It suggests that, relative to the heat-killed bacteria or whole protein, vaccination with the SCT can focus the immune response on an immunodominant CD8 + T cell epitope.",

            "text": "Generation of functional memory responses is a critical issue for vaccines against infection. We showed that mice have protective immunity at 4 weeks after SCT DNA immunization. But antigens may be still expressed at the time of bacteria challenge because it was reported that antigen expression was still detectable at 10 weeks following intradermal DNA injection [37] . Therefore we examined whether memory CD8 + T cells are generated after DNA immunization of SCTs and their functionality at later time points. Mice were immunized with DNA encoding K d /LLO 91-99 or control SCTs as described above and rested for 5 months before L. monocytogenes challenge. Five months after immunization, K d /LLO 91-99 tetramer positive CD8 + T cells were present in the spleen of resting mice immunized with K d /LLO 91-99 SCTs, and IFN\u03b3 production was detected after peptide stimulation in vitro ( Fig. 3A and B) . The CD8 + T cells had memory phenotypes, CD44 hi and CD62L lo (Fig. 3A and not shown) . To examine the recall response of memory T cells, we infected the vaccinated mice with 1\u00d710 3 L. monocytogenes and compared CD8 + T cell responses 7 days later between control, K d /LLO 91-99 SCTs-immune, and L. monocytogenesimmune mice. Mice immunized with K d /LLO 91-99 SCTs had 4-6 times more tetramer positive CD8 + T cells that were CD44 hi (~6.5%) as well as IFN\u03b3 producing CD8 + T cells that were CD62L lo (~10%) than L. monocytogenes-or control SCT -immune mice (Fig. 3C) . Consistent with this finding, when mice were infected with 5\u00d710 4 L. monocytogenes and 3 days later bacteria in the spleen and liver were counted, mice vaccinated with K d /LLO 91-99 SCTs had 10-fold less bacteria than mice immunized with control SCTs in both spleen and liver (Fig. 4) . This was a similar result to that from L. monocytogenes challenge at 4 weeks post-immunization described above. Therefore, the results indicate that DNA immunization of K d /LLO 91-99 SCTs generates functional memory CD8 + T cells and provides protection against L. monocytogenes infection.",

            "text": "Our results indicated that expression of only CD8 + T cell antigens by SCTs was able to generate functional memory CD8 + T cells. Generally, functional memory CD8 + T cells are known to require the presence of CD4 + helper T cells. Although it is not clear yet how CD4 + T cells help to generate and maintain CD8 + T cell function, it has been reported that memory CD8 + T cell responses are defective when CD4 + T cells are absent during the priming phase [38, 39] . In these studies CD8 + T cells were primed with infectious antigens, which is not the case in our study. It is possible that the CD8 + T cell responses we saw after SCT immunization could be enhanced by the presence of activated CD4 + T cells. To determine whether CD4 + T cells lead to improved SCT-induced CD8 + T cell responses, we designed DNA constructs that expressed CD4 + T cell epitopes with SCTs simultaneously (Fig. 5A) . CD4 + T cell epitopes were expressed in the context of an invariant chain (Ii) where a CLIP sequence was replaced with a CD4 + T cell epitope sequence in order for it to be loaded onto MHC II in the appropriate endocytic compartment. Expression of CD4 + T cell epitopes and induction of specific CD4 + T cells using this strategy have been previously reported [40] [41] [42] . The CD4 + T cell epitope/Ii was co-expressed with SCTs under the same promoter using an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). Two different CD4 + helper T cell epitopes were used in the study. One is the peptide LLO 189-200 (one of the dominant CD4 + T cell epitopes of L. monocytogenes that binds to MHC II I-A d ) and the other is the pan CD4 + helper T cell epitope (PADRE). The pan CD4 + T cell epitope (PADRE, AKFVAAWTLKAA), is an engineered peptide that binds to multiple HLA-DR alleles, which also cross-reacts on mouse class II alleles [43] . L. monocytogenes peptide LLO 189-200 (WNEKYAQAYPNV) has been reported to be the most immunodominant CD4 + T cell epitope binding to I-A d in the BALB/c model of L. monocytogenes infection [44] . Mice were immunized as above and CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses and bacteria control were compared among groups immunized with SCTs alone, SCTs plus LLO 189-200 , and SCTs plus PADRE after challenge with L. monocytogenes.",

All three groups showed similar CD8 + T cell responses in terms of the number of K d /LLO 91-99 tetramer positive cells as well as IFN\u03b3 production (Fig. 5C ).

At 6 weeks post-immunization, about the same number of memory phenotype, CD44 hi , CD62L lo and K d /LLO 91-99 tetramer positive CD8 + T cells were present in all three groups and they produced a comparable amount of IFN\u03b3 upon in vitro peptide re-stimulation (data not shown). However, after challenge with a low dose of L. monocytogenes, mice that had been vaccinated with SCTs plus LLO [189] [190] [191] [192] [193] [194] [195] [196] [197] [198] [199] [200] or SCTs plus PADRE showed about 4~5 times more IFN\u03b3-producing CD8 + T cells than mice vaccinated with SCTs alone (Fig. 6A) . SCTs plus LLO 189-200 and SCTs plus PADRE mounted similar recall responses, indicating that CD4 + T cell help is not necessarily antigen-specific. Finally, the vaccinated mice were challenged with a high dose of L. monocytogenes and 3 days later bacteria in the spleen and liver were counted. Mice that had been vaccinated with SCTs plus LLO [189] [190] [191] [192] [193] [194] [195] [196] [197] [198] [199] [200] or SCTs plus PADRE showed no significantly different bacterial counts, indicating that they were able to control bacterial infection equally (Fig. 6B) . However, mice in both groups had about 10-fold less bacteria than mice vaccinated with SCTs alone. Therefore, DNA immunization of K d /LLO 91-99 SCTs generates functional memory CD8 + T cells and expression of CD4 + helper T cell epitopes can further enhance the protective efficacy of SCTs.",

Although it did not achieve the efficacy of vaccination with low dose live bacteria, the SCT DNA vaccine still provided a significant level of protection from infection. The focus of our approach was to optimally target a known immunodominant CD8 + T cell epitope in bacterial infection to the class I antigen presentation pathway and test for protection. It should be noted that heat-killed L. monocytogenes does not provide significant immunological protection [33] . Thus infection with live L. monocytogenes is required for the best protection. Furthermore, there are other CD8 + T cell epitopes in L. monocytogenes besides LLO 91-99 [44] and other arms of the immune system such as neutrophils and macrophages that contribute to L. monocytogenes protection [47, 48] . However, our DNA vaccine using an SCT elicited a more robust response than live L. monocytogenes infection to the immunodominant LLO 91-99 epitope, demonstrating efficient antigen presentation. Furthermore, SCT approaches are likely to benefit from prime-boost strategies or co-expression with different adjuvants such as CpG oligonucleotides (ODN) or IL-12. Indeed, in a previous study, gene gun vaccination with DNA plasmid encoding LLO protein and CpG ODN required a prime/boost inoculation with a 45 day interval to generate significant numbers of Listeria-specific CD8 + T cells [35] . By comparison with our findings, we conclude that SCT approaches can focus early CTL responses to immunodominant CD8 + T cell epitopes.",

The presence of CD4 + T cell help improved the recall response and protective efficacy marginally. Generation of functional memory responses is essential to develop successful vaccines against pathogens and considerable effort has been made in developing strategies to induce high frequencies of memory T cells [49] . In the literature, there has been agreement that primary CD8 + T cell responses do not depend on CD4 + T cell help [50, 51] , which is consistent with our results. However, the role of CD4 + T cell help for the generation of stable, protective CD8 + T cell memory is still controversial. Our study shows that memory CD8 + T cells were generated without activation of CD4 + T cells, which seems in contrast to the studies supporting a requirement for CD4 + T cell help for the generation of CD8 + T cell memory [26, 38, 39, 51] . However, in those studies CD8 + T cells developed in the absence of CD4 + T cells using MHC class II-or CD4-knockout mice, whereas CD4 + T cells were present during SCT-induced CD8 + T cell generation in our study. Indeed, Bevan et al. demonstrated that effector CD8 + T cells became functionally impaired after transfer into MHC II-deficient recipients, but not into wild-type recipients [26] , implying a role of CD4 + T cells in the maintenance of functional memory CD8 + T cells. Our results that co-expression of CD4 + helper T cell epitopes did not affect primary CD8 + T cell responses but increased secondary CD8 + T cell responses and protective efficacy support the conclusion that CD4 + T cells play a role for the maintenance of memory CD8 + T cells. Additionally, the similar extent of augmentation of CD8 + T cell responses by LLO 189-200 and PADRE suggest that CD4 + T cell function is not antigen specific. Our results are consistent with the study by T. C. Wu et al. where co-administration of Ii-PADRE DNA with K b SCT DNA encoding a tumor epitope further enhanced generation of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells and anti-tumor effects against tumor challenge [17] .",

In the cytotoxic T cell response to noninfectious agents such as immunization with protein antigens, activation of CD4 + T cells is important for maturation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) necessary to promote a CD8 + T cell response. CD4 + T cells could function solely via activation of the antigen presenting cells through CD40-CD40L interaction or also via direct CD4-CD8 T cell interaction [51, 52] . Thus the amount of danger signals produced by the immunization seems to be important. Accordingly, in the CTL response to virulent pathogens, the generation of memory CD8 + T cell precursors is CD4 + T cell independent [55, 56] . One of the mechanisms for the immune responses by DNA vaccines is the innate responses directed against the plasmid itself. Because the plasmid is of bacterial origin, its sequences contain CpG oligodeoxynucleotide motifs that bind the pattern recognition receptor Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), which is constitutively expressed on dendritic cells, and results in augmentation of the immune response against the antigen encoded by the plasmid [57, 58] . However, the role of TLR9 in DNA vaccines is still inconsistent between studies [59, 60] . Additionally, it has been reported that gene-gun administration of DNA stimulates a type 2 immune response due to the low amount of DNA injected, consequently fewer CpG motifs, whereas a type 1 immune response is critical to clear intracellular bacteria like L. monocytogenes [35, 61, 62] . However, our data show that SCT DNA vaccination using the gene-gun method can provide protection against L. monocytogenes. We speculate that SCT DNA immunization does not largely depend on CD4 + T cell help because the high density expression of epitope/MHC I complexes at the cell surface using a SCT format overcomes the limited adjuvant.",

A shaded histogram shows staining of untransfected cells. (B) Activation of hybridomas specific for LLO 91-99/K d by K d /LLO 91-99 SCT-expressing cells. Transfected 293T cells were incubated with T hybridomas at the ratios of 1:1 for 24 hours and the amounts of IL-2 in the culture supernatant were measured by ELISA. For controls, P815 cells that express endogenous K d were incubated with hybridomas with or without 1\u00b5g/mL of LLO 91-99 peptide.",
