The results indicate that the urban labor market experienced a direct effect in terms of a reduction in employment of the group vulnerable to the epidemic while the rural labor market experienced an indirect effect on its economy through a reduction in employment resulting from a decline in consumption and leisure activities. If one looks into the employment in the accommodation and leisure industry, which sustained the most severe blow, dropped to its lowest level right after the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. The rural leisure and accommodation industries are highly likely to be dependent on consumption and spending from urban areas. The results suggest that the rural labor market was influenced by the spillover/external effects caused by behavioral changes among people in urban areas due to fear of infection. Thus, this empirical analysis can be used to customize policy to support regions that can be negatively impacted by spillovers due to epidemic in order to respond against economic stresses.",

When people had to go outside, they wore masks, and people who sneezed without wearing masks were finger-pointed as lacking common sense. This was due to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic that was first confirmed on May 20, 2015. In fact, MERS is a contagious disease that has low morbidity and mortality rates, but the MERS epidemic in Korea had a significant impact on the labor market and on the wider economy due to the large number of quarantined people (about one in every 3000 Koreans) and excessive media coverage (Bank of Korea, 2015; Mediaus, 2015) .",

The former chairman of the Korean Medical Association said, \"Korean society was faced with two daunting challenges. One is the MERS itself, and the other is the overblown fear of MERS\" (Noh, 2015) . According to Noh (2015) , fear spread quickly and was amplified to the extent that it turned Pyeongtaek, one of the cities adjacent to the Korean capital city of Seoul, into a 'ghost city'. He stressed, \"If one compares MERS to tuberculosis, the latter is a more prevalent airborne disease and is more lethal than MERS, given that it claimed 2466 lives in 2013 alone. However, few people refrain from going outside and meeting people or wear masks all day out of fear of tuberculosis, and temporary school closure will not be issued either. Such an excessively chaotic situation as now is not desirable.\" On June 11, 2015, after all, the Bank of Korea took a drastic measure to lower its base interest rate by a 0.25% point. The main reason for the reduction interest was not a delayed economic recovery but the economic losses caused by MERS as well as concerns on the worsening economic situation. Previous studies have said that in addition to a high mortality and confirmation rate, the fear of infection spread through rumors and mass media could have a significant influence on the economy (Eichelberger, 2007; Fenichel, 2013) . Therefore, despite its low morbidity and mortality, the MERS epidemic might have a great impact on the labor market and on the entire economy of South Korea.",

Infectious diseases can deal a blow to employment of vulnerable groups (Lee and Cho, 2016) , and the standard of living, disposable income, savings, education, and health and overall psyche of a society are determined by current levels of employment and unemployment (Shama and Krishna, 2007) . Therefore, it is very important to study employment in relation to disaster (infectious diseases). Moreover, given that urban areas are closely connected with rural areas, they inevitably influence each other (Srivastava and Shaw, 2012) , and as such, an unexpected externality can occur (O'Sullivan, 2007) . Here, the term 'externality' refers to people in a community that can benefit from or suffer loss due to a decision made by another community, i.e., an external decision. Even if an infectious disease takes place in an urban area, decisions made by people in the urban area can have an unintended influence on people in rural areas.",

            "text": "When an infectious disease like MERS breaks out, its possible impact on a country's labor market and on the wider economy can appear in the form of direct or indirect effects (Lee and McKibbin, 2004a,b; World Bank, 2014) . The direct effects caused by an infectious disease include a decrease in the labor supply of vulnerable groups due to their relative high morbidity and mortality rate or fear of contagion. On the other hand, the indirect effects are those caused by people's behavioral changes. These behavioral changes include avoiding consumption and leisure activities for fear of contagion, which in turn results in a decline in the consumption of goods and services, ultimately leading to a drop in domestic employment. Therefore, the groups of people vulnerable to the MERS epidemic (with a high confirmation and mortality rate) in an urban area where a large number of people are quarantined may have their employment activities directly affected. In contrast, a rural area may suffer from a decrease in the consumption of goods and services due to urban dwellers' behavioral changes, such as a decrease in leisure activities and consumption, which is then expected to negatively impact rural employment. In particular, accommodation and leisure industry can play an important role in stimulation the rural economy (Kadiyali and Kosov\u00e1, 2013) . Unlike local employment, which is defined as that in workplaces that operate to fulfill local consumption, those employed in the rural accommodation and leisure industry are highly dependent on non-local(urban area) consumption and spending (O'Sullivan, 2007) . Moreover, there is general belief that leisure industry (tourism) generates spillovers/ externalities to other industries, thus boosting local economies (Kadiyali and Kosov\u00e1, 2013) . Eventually, due to such spillovers, there is a possibility that a negative externality occurs in the urbanrural labor market.",

The news media speculated the possibility of a domestic epidemic as a rumor that a restaurant employee had been inflected with SARS spread through e-mail. 14% of survey respondents said they avoided Asian businesses, and New York City's Chinatown experienced a heightened anxiety and fear of stigmatization. Eventually, the rumor and its news coverage caused a tremendous drop in business and tourism in Chinatown. Even without a single confirmed case of SARS in New York City's China town, the community was quickly identified as a contagion and risk site (Eichelberger, 2007) . As shown in this study, it is not only the high mortality and confirmation rate of an infectious disease that can have a significant impact on the economy, but also the fear of 'contagion' spread through rumors and the mass media. Fenichel (2013) analyzed the effect that contagious disease can have on social distancing and social welfare. The author maintained that social distancing and quarantine policies tend to show an 'overdone' phenomenon, which leads to a decrease in welfare. This can cause economically undesirable outcomes, and can also potentially exacerbate the health outcomes.",

Shama and Krishna (2007) indicated that since the urban and rural poor are dependent on their daily wages, they are the groups that are vulnerable to disasters due to the strong correlation between disaster and employment. They added that the standard of living, disposable income, savings, education, health and overall psyche of a society are determined by current levels of employment and unemployment. The World Bank (2014) reported that an infectious disease can exert an impact on the economy through two channels. First, a direct effect of sickness and mortality can reduce the labor supply temporarily or even permanently. Second, people's fear of contagion can result in behavioral changes where fear of contagion through contact with other people reduces the labor force participation and leads to the closure of workplaces. The SARS epidemic outbreaks between 2002 and 2004 and H1N1 flu epidemic outbreak in 2009 resulted in behavioral effects that were responsible for 80-90% of the actual total impact of the contagious diseases on the economy (Lee and McKibbin, 2004a,b; World Bank, 2014) . In Liberia, for example, many hotel and restaurant employees in the service industry were laid off, and the number of available jobs were reduced to half (World Bank, 2014). Lee and Warner (2005) analyzed the effects of SARS on Hong Kong's economy. After investigating employment and unemployment conditions in the labor market, the study concluded that the SARS epidemic caused a drastic drop in room occupancy rates in hotels, which in turn led to an increase in unemployment or underemployment and also to a surge of no-pay leaves.",

(2003) analyzed the impact that the IMF crisis had on the urban and rural labor markets. The results of the analysis indicated that the IMF crisis had a negative impact on employment, especially for elderly workers in the rural labor market. Lim (2000) analyzed the effect of the East Asian crisis on employment in the Philippines by dividing it into rural and urban areas. The results of their analysis indicated a reduction in unemployment in the urban areas that mostly benefited young people aged 15-34 for females and aged 20-34 for the males. There was also some reduction in the rural unemployment rates for females, especially those aged 20-34. However, there was no improvement in employment rates for males in rural areas. Thus, rural and urban areas that are closely linked to each other are inevitably subject to influence by a certain shock, but the impact they suffer may be different for each case. Srivastava and Shaw (2012) said that even though difference scenarios unfold in urban and rural areas, they are interrelated to the extent to which one has influence over the other, predominantly after a disaster. In addition, they showed a strong interrelation in a negative aspect but a weak association in a positive aspect (Lee et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "On May 20, 2015, the first confirmed MERS patient in South Korea was a Korean male who had visited the Middle East. The total number of confirmed patients was recorded at 186 persons, and among them, 38 people lost their lives. In addition, 1164 schools were temporarily closed, and the biggest reason for which the MERS epidemic had a huge impact was the quarantine of 16,752 people. When considering the entire population in Korea, one in every three thousand people was quarantined. In addition, the lack of information and the perceived loss of control amplified fear and anxiety among people (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 2 shows the number of confirmed cases and the mortality rates by age. Although the infected patient population was evenly distributed throughout different age groups, the number of confirmed patients and the mortality rate increased among those aged 50 years or above. Therefore, people of all age groups can be assumed to inevitably be fearful of the MERS epidemic. Among them, those aged more than 50 years were found to have a relatively higher risk rate than the other age groups, and it can be assumed that their fear level might be relatively higher than that of other age groups. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of quarantined people in urban and rural areas. The quarantined people in Korea were heavily concentrated in a certain urban area, and the number of quarantined people increased dramatically in areas adjacent to the place of the first outbreak. In urban areas with a highly dense population, the number of quarantined people was extremely high. As of June 9, 2015, the distribution map shows that 90% of the quarantined people were concentrated in urban areas. Thus, the MERS epidemic dealt a severe blow to urban areas in South Korea. Urban areas close to the South Korean capital city of Seoul had a high concentration of quarantined people. After June 9, the number of quarantined people surged, and those who came into contact with confirmed patients or previously quarantined people were also put into isolation. In other words, the quarantine was additionally expanded to urban areas that the distribution map indicated already had a presence of quarantined people (The Chosunilbo, 2015) . The main reason for the lower number of people quarantined by the MERS epidemic in rural areas was that the disease was mainly transmitted in hospitals in cities (urban regions), so the number of quarantined people was heavily concentrated in these urban areas. All in all, urban areas suffered the direct impact caused by the disease itself.",

According to Local Area Labour Force Survey data officially provided by Statistics Korea, 98% of employees have residences located in the same region as their workplaces. In other words, there was a slim chance for the risk of contagion between regions to increase due to work activities of urban dwellers commuting to workplaces in rural areas (1.90%) or of rural dwellers commuting to workplaces in urban areas (0.60%). Despite that, since the urban and rural areas are closely linked to each other, they inevitably influence each other and are subject to the influence of a certain shock (Strivastava and Shaw, 2012). In the case of the onset of an epidemic disease, it is natural for people show behavioral changes, including a decrease in travel and leisure activities. The leisure (travel) and accommodation industries in rural areas, which took the brunt of the MERS epidemic, are highly likely to be maintained through non-local (urban) consumption and spending. Therefore, if an epidemic breaks out in a city, urban dwellers' decisions can have an unintended effect on people in rural areas.",

In contrast, in urban areas subjected to the direct impact of a contagious disease, it is the group vulnerable to MERS that can suffer a direct blow to their employment condition. Middle-aged and elderly people can suffer from a more severe impact (Lee and Cho, 2016) because they have a high mortality risk when infected with the MERS disease through human contact. Therefore, the middle-aged and elderly have a high probability of a reduction in their labor supply either through voluntary or involuntary means. The age group vulnerable to the MERS (those aged more than 50) suffered a direct shock, which is defined in this study as a direct effect (S Direct ). The other age group (between 15 and 49 years), a relatively more economically active group, are subject to an indirect shock due to behavioral changes, including a decrease in consumption and leisure activities, and this is defined as the Indirect effect (S Indirect ).

However, right after the onset of the MERS epidemic, the rural areas showed a higher unemployment variation over the same period of the previous year than in the urban areas. However, the unemployment rate in June and July 2014 was higher relative to the same period of the previous year. The reason for this was presumed to be the Sewol Ferry disaster in April 2014. This was one of the most serious human-made disasters, with 291 deaths and 13 missing individuals as of June 8, 2014. The disaster caused nationwide sadness and sluggish demand and employment in the accommodation, restaurant, arts, sports and recreation sectors (Ministry of Strategy and Finance, 2014). Also, the study was set with the year 2010 as the starting point because the ramifications from the 2008 financial crisis had almost disappeared by that time, which we can assume had ripple effects that remained up until 2010. If we compare the overall trends, both the rural and urban areas showed a remarkable increase in unemployment after the occurrence of the MERS epidemic. In particular, the rural areas revealed a dramatic surge in unemployment, and the urban areas showed the highest unemployment rate in June 2015 when the fear of contagion was at its peak. The unemployment rate in July 2015 decreased relative to that of June of the same year since the fear of contagion had subsided. However, the rural areas displayed a remarkable increase in unemployment in June 2015 and continued to show an increase until July. Therefore, the rural areas can be assumed to have sustained a different type of impact when compared to urban areas that suffered a direct shock (Fig. 4) . Fig. 5 showed the results of a comparison of unemployment rates between the vulnerable group of those aged more than 50 years (with a high morbidity and mortality group regarding MERS) and the non-vulnerable group of those aged less than 50 years (a relatively more economically active group), both in urban and rural areas.

For this reason, this study performed the DD analysis using the probit model. showed a dramatic increase in unemployment among those aged more than 50 years. If one looks into unemployment trends in urban areas since 2010, those aged 50 years old and above displayed the highest unemployment rate after the onset of MERS.",

            "text": "In contrast, if we look into unemployment trends in rural areas since 2010, both those aged more than 50 years and those aged less than 50 years showed the highest unemployment rates after the outbreak of MERS. If one then looks into the year-on-year unemployment variations for the same time period, those aged less than 50 years showed a more remarkable increase in unemployment after the MERS epidemic. Therefore, it can be assumed that the vulnerable group in urban areas might experience a dramatic increase in unemployment since they suffered the direct impact of the contagious disease. In contrast, the economically active population in rural areas underwent a remarkable surge in unemployment due to the slowdown in domestic demand caused by a decrease in leisure activities and consumption by urban dwellers. The study then examined the industries that suffered losses due to the onset of the MERS epidemic. (Lee and Warner, 2005; World Bank, 2014) . In the case of a disease that can spread through human-to-human contact, it is natural for people to cancel their tourism packages and travel plans. Therefore, rural areas experienced severe indirect losses due to domestic demand slowdown and dwindling consumption caused by behavioral changes among people, even when they otherwise suffered a mild direct impact of the contagious disease when compared to urban areas. Fig. 7 shows the employment ratio in rural and urban areas corresponding to those aged more than 50 years and those aged less than 50 years in various industries affected after the onset of the MERS epidemic and industries that were relatively unaffected. In urban areas, the affected industries showed similar age ratios when compared to those of the relatively unaffected industries. For both the affected and unaffected industries in urban areas, those aged less than 50 years old had a higher employment ratio than those aged more than 50 years. In contrast, those aged less than 50 years in rural areas had a higher employment rate in the affected industries than in the unaffected industries. Therefore, those aged less than 50 years were actively engaged in economic activities in the accommodation and leisure industries. Fig. 8 shows a comparison of the employment trends for affected industries that suffered severe losses in production output due to the MERS epidemic with those of unaffected industries. The urban areas did not show any significant differences in employment trends between accommodation and leisure and the other industries. The year-on year variations showed a similar trend when compared to the previous trend. In contrast, the rural areas showed that those aged less than 50 years showed a significant drop in employment over the same period of the previous year after the onset of the MERS epidemic, and the absolute number of unemployed persons reached the lowest since 2010. The employment did not show an instant change as unemployment did. Despite that, rural areas can be assumed to contain those aged less than 50 years who were employed in the affected industries, including accommodation and leisure, and suffered a negative impact. Table 2 shows the results of the analysis performed by dividing the unemployment status before and after the MERS epidemic into the entire nation, the urban areas and the rural areas. The unemployment status increased after the occurrence of the MERS epidemic. The probability of unemployment was increased by 0.24% 4 across the entire nation, with 0.17% increase in the urban areas, and 0.56% increase in rural areas. The results of the falsification analysis indicated that the probability of unemployment had decreased until 2013 while the probability of employment showed an increasing trend. In 2014, the urban areas displayed a high possibility of unemployment, and as mentioned above, the reason for the increase in unemployment was due to the Sewol ferry disaster on April 16, 2014. When the actual trends were controlled, the probability of unemployment was increased by 0.45% across the nation, by 0.43% in urban areas, and by 0.53% in rural areas, after the onset of MERS. Therefore, the MERS epidemic is assumed to have had a negative impact on the Korean labor market, not only in urban areas which suffered a direct impact from the contagious disease but also in rural areas. 5 Table 3 shows the results of an analysis of whether the MERS epidemic actually dealt a more severe blow to the labor market in urban areas, where a large number of people were quarantined for fear of contagion, than to the labor market of rural areas. Contrary to the expectations, the probability of unemployment for the rural labor market was increased by 0.70% when compared to that of the urban labor market after the onset of MERS. The robustness check was performed by controlling differential trends to hold the assumption that there might be a common trend in outcomes between the urban and rural areas, and the rural areas exhibited a higher probability of unemployment than the urban areas by 0.37%. As seen in Table 3 , the rural labor market suffered greater losses than the urban labor market although the latter experienced a more direct impact of the MERS epidemic than the former. Table 4 shows the results of an analysis examining whether the negative impact suffered in the rural and urban labor markets appeared with different characteristics. The analysis indicated that in urban areas that were under the direct influence of the MERS epidemic, the probability of unemployment for those aged more than 50 years who were vulnerable to the MERS epidemic increased by 0.60% compared to those aged less than 50 years, ceteris paribus. If we examine the results by controlling for differential time trends, the probability of unemployment for those aged more than 50 years old was increased by 0.72% compared to those aged less than 50 years after the MERS outbreak. These results can be assumed that in urban areas, which accounted for an overwhelming majority of the quarantined people, the vulnerable age group suffered direct impact in the labor market. If we look into the labor market in rural areas that experienced a minor direct shock from contagious disease, those aged less than 50 years showed a higher increase in unemployment than those aged more than 50 years. If one examines the past trends in the rural labor market, those aged more than 50 years showed a gradual increase in unemployment. However, after the onset of MERS, the probability of unemployment among those aged less than 50 years was higher by 0.18% than that among those aged more than 50 years. Table 3 shows that considering that the rural labor market suffered greater losses than the urban labor market, all age groups in the rural areas might suffer an impact from the MERS epidemic, and that among them, those aged less than 50 years sustained a more severe blow. The results of further analysis after extracting only non-farming households from the entire subject population with differential time trends controlled show that those aged less than 50 years had a higher possibility of unemployment by 0.3% than those aged more than 50 years. As seen in Fig. 6 , if we examine the age groups of employees in the affected industries, including accommodation, food and leisure, those aged less than 50 years in rural areas showed a higher employment ratio than those aged more than 50 years. Therefore, it is assumed that the economically active age group in the rural labor market suffered more due to the indirect effects caused by the decrease in people's consumption and leisure activities out of fear of contagion.",

The results of the analysis show that there is no significant difference with Table 4 . In addition, when we consider the different time trends from June, July 2010 to Jun, July 2014, the unemployment effect of rural area becomes relatively mild.

In accordance with the definitions, the analysis result indicates that for the entire labor market, the temporarily laid-off are hiked after the MERS incident. In rural areas, after the epidemic, the probability of the temporarily laid-off increased in both the group aged between 15 and 49 and the group over 50s. In urban area, after MERS outbreak, the group aged between 15 and 49 shows a higher probability of temporarily laid-off while the possibility for temporary quit by voluntary reasons was higher for the group of over 50s. We could argue that in the urban labor market, the population over 50 s tends to quit their jobs temporarily more to avoid the MERS infection (Table 6) .",

As Eichelberger (2007) argued in his study, the contagion of fear that becomes widespread through rumors and the mass media could have a significant impact on the economy.

In contrast, although rural areas experienced a less direct impact of the infectious disease, the rural labor market actually suffered more severe losses than the urban market did. These results confirm the hypothesis that the indirect effect caused by economic losses due to behavioral changes among urban people for fear of contagion might dominate the direct effect of the disease (S Direct < S Indirect ). This argument can thus be corroborated by the fact that the economically active age group, that is, those aged less than 50 years, suffered a relatively more severe blow in the rural labor market. These results are similar to the argument posed by the World Bank (2014) that a contagious disease can have an impact on the economy through two channels: a direct effect of the disease and an indirect effect of people's behavioral changes. 6 Should the MERS epidemic reduces a labor supply, the wage rates could be increased. Stated reversely, when it reduces a labor demand, the wage rate could be decreased. In Korea, however, it is well known that the seniority based wage system, where the yearly wage change is mostly determined by seniority, is prevailed (Woo and Cho, 2016) . Unlike the performance based wage system popular in many developed countries (e.g, the job-based wage system in US), the seniority based wage system makes wage sluggish in response to the economic conditions or the change in labor supply and demand. OECD also evaluates the Korean labor market is rigid due to the seniority based payment and the high employment protection for the regular workers (Cho, 2005; Cho and Keum, 2009; OECD, 2017) . When people, who are vulnerable to epidemics, quit their jobs temporarily to avoid the MERS infection, the impact should be observed instantly during the epidemic period. Thus, instead of focusing on wage rates, we further analyzed the temporarily laid-off and temporary quit by voluntary reasons from June, July 2014 to June, July 2015.",

Even if the outbreak of the infectious disease is heavily concentrated in a certain area (e.g., urban areas) the decision-making of people in the affected region can have an unintended impact on other areas (e.g., rural area). Such externalities can have an influence on the labor market, especially for the leisure and accommodation industries in rural areas that are highly likely to be maintained by non-local (urban area) consumption and spending. In other words, urban and rural areas are closely linked, and they inevitably influence each other, but the scenarios that unfold in urban and rural areas may appear in different ways. To this end, this study analyzed and compared the employment changes in the urban areas that were directly hit by the epidemic with the ones in rural areas that remained relatively unaffected by the disease itself.",

Although the urban areas accounted for about 90% of the quarantined people, the rural areas (which took up only 10% of the quarantined) suffered a more negative effect. In urban areas, the vulnerable age group of more than 50 years old showed a higher possibility of unemployment than the non-vulnerable age group of less than 50 years old. In contrast, rural areas showed the opposite results. In the case of the accommodation, food and leisure industries, which were severely damaged by the MERS epidemic, the rural areas showed that those aged less than 50 years old, an economically active group, experienced a more severe blow than those aged more than 50. In fact, the share of the number of employed persons (of those aged less than 50 years who engaged in the rural accommodation and leisure industries) in the number of working age population reached the lowest point since 2010, and the year-on-year variations over the same period also showed the steepest drop.",

The rural areas actually sustained a more severe blow in the labor market than the urban areas, and itcan be assumed that the indirect effect became dominant because economic losses caused by people's behavioral changes had a more negative influence on rural employment (S Direct < S Indirect ). This argument can be further corroborated by the fact that those aged less than 50 years who were economically active in the accommodation, food and leisure industries in rural areas showed the lowest level of employment after the onset of the MERS epidemic.",
