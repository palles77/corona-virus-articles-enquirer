DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin, and interactions with mycobacterial cells are believed to occur via mannosylated structures on the mycobacterial surface. Recent studies suggest more varied modes of binding to multiple mycobacterial ligands. Here we identify, by affinity chromatography and mass-spectrometry, four novel ligands of M. bovis BCG that bind to DC-SIGN. The novel ligands are chaperone protein DnaK, 60 kDa chaperonin-1 (Cpn60.1), glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and lipoprotein lprG. Other published work strongly suggests that these are on the cell surface. Of these ligands, lprG appears to bind DC-SIGN via typical proteinglycan interactions, but DnaK and Cpn60.1 binding do not show evidence of carbohydrate-dependent interactions. LprG was also identified as a ligand for DC-SIGNR (L-SIGN; CD299) and the M. tuberculosis orthologue of lprG has been found previously to interact with human toll-like receptor 2. Collectively, these findings offer new targets for combating mycobacterial adhesion and within-host survival, and reinforce the role of DC-SIGN as an important host ligand in mycobacterial infection.",

            "text": "Tuberculosis is the world's most prevalent infectious disease affecting a third of the global human population. The causative agent of tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, avoids the destructive capacity of the host immune system by residing inside the phagosome of host mononuclear phagocytes (Armstrong and Hart, 1975; Clemens and Horwitz, 1995; Sturgill-Koszycki et al., 1996) . Many studies have shown that M. tuberculosis, M. paratuberculosis and M. bovis BCG can bind to dendritic-cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN/CD209) to promote entry into human dendritic cells (DCs) and alveolar macrophages Maeda et al., 2003; Tailleux et al., 2003; Pitarque et al., 2005; Appelmelk et al., 2008) . A recent study indicates that a mutation of DC-SIGN causing lower expression is protective against tuberculosisinduced lung cavitation (Vannberg et al., 2008) . DC-SIGN is a 44 kDa type II transmembrane protein that consists of a carbohydrate recognition domain, neck domain, transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail. It is expressed mainly on DCs and on selected macrophage populations including alveolar macrophages (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000a; Lee et al., 2001; Maeda et al., 2003) . DC-SIGN is a calcium-dependent lectin and has a high affinity for mannosylated surfaces, forming tetrameric complexes when binding to high mannose glycoproteins, such as HIV gp120 (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000b; Feinberg et al., 2001; Mitchell et al., 2001; Appelmelk et al., 2003) . DC-SIGN has been shown to bind lipolysaccharide Le x and mannose structures found on bacteria, such as Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumonia and M. tuberculosis Geijtenbeek et al., 2003; Tailleux et al., 2003; van Kooyk and Geijtenbeek, 2003) . Using purified cell wall components from mycobacteria, DC-SIGN was shown to bind lipoarabinomannan (LAM) structures from M. tuberculosis, M. bovis and M. bovis BCG, all of which express mannose-capped LAM (ManLAM). However, LAM purified from M. smegmatis did not bind DC-SIGN, since it expresses uncapped LAM, so-called AraLAM. Similarly, LAM from M. avium bound poorly to DC-SIGN since it expresses single mannose residue attachments and thus presents lower mannoside density Maeda et al., 2003) . ManLAM was therefore believed to be the major ligand on M. tuberculosis for binding to DC-SIGN (Maeda et al., 2003; Tailleux et al., 2003) . However, later studies showed that removal of the mannose-cap in experiments using whole bacteria did not appear to have a dramatic effect on DC-SIGN binding. The faster growing mycobacteria such as M. smegmatis or M. avium could also bind DC-SIGN despite not having the mannose caps, suggesting that other components in the mycobacterial cell wall were also binding DC-SIGN. Mannosylated lipoproteins found on the cell surface of mycobacteria such as 19 kDa lipoprotein lpqH/Rv3763 and a 45 kDa lipoprotein were shown to contribute to the binding of DC-SIGN to the bacteria (Pitarque et al., 2005; Appelmelk et al., 2008) . These studies have revealed that the binding interaction of DC-SIGN to M. tuberculosis is more complicated than originally perceived, and suggests that there may be more potential DC-SIGN ligands present on M. tuberculosis.",

            "text": "We set out first to confirm the binding of DC-SIGN to whole M. bovis BCG, using lung surfactant protein A (SP-A) and BSA as positive and negative controls respectively. We also compared the binding of DC-SIGN to that of DC-SIGNR. By flow cytometry, we found that the binding of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR to whole M. bovis BCG is dose-dependent ( Fig. 1) , reaching a maximum at a protein input of about 10 \u03bcg per 5 \u00d7 10 8 cells ( Fig. 2A) . SP-A also binds dosedependently, while BSA does not bind. Binding of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are predominantly Ca 2+ -dependent, as binding is reduced by~80% in the presence of EDTA ( Fig. 2B ) compared with binding in 5 mM CaCl 2 . Binding of SP-A appears less dependent on Ca 2+ ions, as binding is reduced < 50% in EDTA. Mannose (50 mM) inhibits the binding of DC-SIGN and SP-A by less than 20%, while binding of DC-SIGNR is reduced by about 70% (Fig. 2B ). These findings are compatible with the view that DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR and SP-A are all likely to be binding to several bacterial ligands and the results with mannose and EDTA suggest more than one mode of binding. For DC-SIGNR, the results are consistent with its binding mainly (~80%) via its calcium-dependent carbohydrate binding site. For DC-SIGN and SP-A, a much smaller proportion (10%-20%) of binding may be mediated via these sites, and other binding occurs via Ca 2+ -independent sites, and also via Ca 2+ dependent sites that do not constitute the canonical carbohydrate binding site. Similar diversity for modes of binding of SP-A to viable and apoptotic mammalian cells has been observed previously (J\u00e4kel et al., 2010a, b, c) .",

From the gel (Fig. 3) four visible bands can be seen at 74, 60, 37 and 27 kDa. As a control M. bovis BCG lysates were passed through a control column made of underivatised Sepharose in the same way. No protein was detected in the eluted fractions of the control column, indicating no non-specific binding interactions (not shown). The 74, 60, 37 and 27 kDa bands were cut from the gel and analyzed by MALDI-TOF tryptic peptide fingerprinting mass spectrometry, and database searches carried out against both NCIBr and SwissProt. The bands were identified as chaperone protein DnaK, 60 kDa chaperonin (Cpn60.1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH) and lipoprotein lprG, respectively ( Table 1 ). All of these have the same protein sequence in M. tuberculosis as in M. bovis BCG (Table 1) . Two other minor candidates, CTP synthase and ATP synthase beta subunit (Table 1) were not considered further.",

This potential N-linked glycosylation site occurs in one of the Cpn60.1 peptides identified during mass spectrometry. This indicates that the site was not occupied by an oligosaccharide otherwise the peptide molecular mass would have been affected and unidentifiable during analysis. The site may be partially occupied indicating that there may be another population of this protein with an N-linked glycan present at N 506 . However, the form of this protein identified after capture by the affinity column was not glycosylated at this position, and it is therefore very unlikely that DC-SIGN binds to this ligand via its Ca 2+ -dependent lectin activity. Similarly, no potential N-linked glycosylation sites for DnaK were found ( Fig. 4) , suggesting that it also is not bound to DC-SIGN via Nglycans. From the current literature it is unknown whether these proteins undergo any O-linked glycosylation, but use of in silico O-glycosylation prediction tools available at the EXPASy (Expert Protein Analysis System) proteomics server (http://expasy.org/tools/; Gasteiger et al., 2003) indicates no predicted O-glycosylation in either protein.",

There are no published data on the localization of Cpn60.1, but a related protein, Cpn60.2 was also shown to be on the cell surface of M. tuberculosis, and has a role in the adherence of M. tuberculosis to macrophages (Hickey et al., 2009 ). Cpn60.1 and Cpn60.2 show 61% amino acid sequence identity (Kong et al., 1993) . Hickey et al. (2009) showed that macrophages formed specific interactions with M. tuberculosis, which could be inhibited by pre-incubation with increasing concentrations of Cpn60.2 or by blocking surface localized Cpn60.2 with F(ab') 2 antibody. This was supported by showing that purified Cpn60.2 could bind to the surface of macrophages. Although DnaK was also shown to be located at the mycobacterial cellsurface, Hickey et al. (2009) could not show consistent binding via DnaK to macrophages using antibodies to block the reaction. This may have been due to a lack of appropriate anti-DnaK antibodies. In Listeria monocytogenes, DnaK has been shown to facilitate phagocytosis of the pathogen into macrophages (Hanawa et al., 1999) . The same authors observed that wild type bacteria were endocytosed more than DnaK knockouts. Once inside the macrophage DnaK was shown not to be essential for multiplication within the cell although it was necessary for cell entry. Studies looking at the pathogenic role of the DnaK and its co-chaperone DnaJ, in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium revealed that they are both essential for internalising the bacteria within epithelial cells and survival within macrophages (Takaya et al., 2004) .",

Running at~37 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3) , GAPDH was identified with three peptide matches, covering 15.04% of the protein sequence. The calculated mass of the protein is 35,955 Da and two potential N-linked glycosylation sites are present in the sequence, N 53 ST and N 154 AS (Table 1, Fig. 4 ). These two potential Nlinked glycosylation sites may be occupied by carbohydrate structures required for DC-SIGN binding via its CRD. This protein has significant homology to the GAPDH enzymes indentified in Group A Streptococcus, enteropathogenic E. coli, and Candida albicans (Parker and Bermudez, 2000) . GAPDH is an important enzyme in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic metabolism that catalyzes a step of glycolysis, converting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to glycerate 1,3-bisphosphate. GAPDH is more commonly recognized as a cytosolic enzyme found on the inner surface of the cell membrane. Even though there is no apparent signal sequence or stretch of hydrophobic residues to indicate a transmembrane region (Fig. 4) , studies have reported that a 37 kDa protein homologous to GAPDH is expressed on the outer cell membrane of hematopoietic cells (Allen et al., 1987) and also on many microorganisms such as Group A Streptococcus, enteropathogenic E. coli, Candida albicans, Mycobacterium avium and Schistosoma mansoni (Goudot-Crozel et al., 1989; Pancholi and Fischetti, 1992; Kenny and Finlay, 1995; Gil-Navarro et al., 1997; Parker and Bermudez, 2000) . M. avium expresses GAPDH on its cell surface, whereupon GAPDH can bind to human epidermal growth factor. In the presence of recombinant human epidermal growth factor the rate of growth of M. tuberculosis and M. avium is rapidly increased (Parker and Bermudez, 2000) .",

LprG actually runs with an apparent molecular weight of 27 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3) and was identified with only one peptide hit with a protein score of 70.07, covering 7.62% of the protein sequence. The calculated mass of the protein is 24,547 Da (Fig. 4) . The identification of lprG was supported by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5 , in eluted fractions DE1-2, DE3-4 and DE5-6 from DC-SIGN affinity chromatography, a strong band can be seen representing lprG. LprG has two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, one of which (N 83 PT) is unoccupied or only partially occupied since it lies in one of the peptides identified by mass spectrometry. The other site, N 185 AT may be occupied. Ligand blot analysis (Fig. 6) of whole M. bovis BCG lysate incubated with either 125 I-DC-SIGN or 125 I-DC-SIGNR revealed that DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR both bind the same protein at around 27 kDa, which corresponds to lprG in our SDS-PAGE system, and is the only ligand detected by this method. DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR binding to lprG can therefore still occur when the mycobacterial protein has been denatured by SDS-PAGE. This strongly suggests that lprG binds to DCSIGN predominantly or entirely via protein-carbohydrate interactions.",

We were unable accurately to detect lipoproteins below bovis BCG lysate in 10 mM Hepes, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl 2 pH 7.4. The Sepharose was placed in a column and washed and bound proteins were eluted with 10 mM Hepes, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA pH 7.4. Eluted fractions were concentrated with Strataclean beads and prepared in reducing conditions for analysis by SDS-PAGE. Concentrated eluates were run on 4%-12% gradient gel. As a negative control, underivatised Sepharose was incubated with the lysate in the same way (results not shown).

Results are representative of three independent experiments. 20 kDa in the affinity chromatography experiment shown in Fig. 3 due to limitations in the SDS-PAGE system used, but in Fig. 6 (ligand blotting) no band in the position of lpqH is seen.

Although many DC-SIGN ligands have been identified at the cell-surface of the mycobacterium, studies suggested that there were more ligands present that had not yet been identified. Here, we have shown DC-SIGN binds to whole M. bovis BCG in both Ca 2+ -dependent and Ca 2+ -independent modes. We have identified four novel ligands for DC-SIGN. Of these only one, lprG appears to bind predominantly via the glycan binding site. LprG is also a ligand for DC-SIGNR. Dendritic cells present in the lung migrate in order to prime T lymphocytes in the lymph nodes. It is believed that M. tuberculosis resides within the phagosome of the DC and exploits the migration thereby circulating within the host undetected (Fenton and Vermeulen, 1996; Henderson et al., 1997; Banchereau and Steinman, 1998) . The discovery of new DC-SIGN binding ligands: DnaK, Cpn60.1, GAPDH and lprG, may help further research into designing inhibitors to prevent interactions between DC-SIGN and M. tuberculosis with the aim of blocking uptake and intracellular survival of mycobacterial cells.

Bacteria alone (solid) or bacteria incubated with protein (open) (5 \u00d7 10 8 cells) were incubated with either biotinylated-DC-SIGN, biotinyalted-DC-SIGNR, SP-A or biotinylated-BSA (1, 5, 10, 20 \u00b5g, respectively). SP-A binding was detected by incubating the cells with a biotinylated monoclonal anti-SPA antibody. All cells were then treated with streptavidin-PE and binding was measured using fluorescent cytometry. Biotinylated-BSA was used as a negative control. Results are representative of three independent experiments.",
