When the aim of surveillance is disease detection and identification of case herds, a risk-based approach can increase the sensitivity of the surveillance system. In this paper, the association between two network analysis measures, i.e. 'in-degree' and 'ingoing infection chain', and signs of infection is investigated. It is shown that based on regression analysis of combined data from a recent cross-sectional study for endemic viral infections and network analysis of animal movements, a positive serological result for bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is significantly associated with the purchase of animals. For BCV, this association was significant also when accounting for herd size and regional cattle density, but not for BRSV. Examples are given for different approaches to include cattle movement data in risk-based surveillance by selecting herds based on network analysis measures. Results show that compared to completely random sampling these approaches increase the number of detected positives, both for BCV and BRSV in our study population. It is concluded that network measures for the relevant time period based on updated databases of animal movements can provide a simple and straight forward tool for risk-based sampling.",

Infectious diseases are seldom homogeneously spread within the population and the benefits of searching \"in the most likely place\" when monitoring disease, in contrast to overall random sampling, have been previously discussed, e.g. by Cannon (2009) and St\u00e4rk et al.

            "text": "Lately there has been an increasing number of publications analysing livestock movements (Dub\u00e9 et al., 2009; Martinez-Lopez et al., 2009) . For instance, the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom in 2001 was the starting point for a number of studies within this field of research (e.g. see Ortiz-Pelaez et al., 2006) . However, although analysis of animal contact patterns has already been suggested for targeting the surveillance of diseases (Christley et al., 2005; Martinez-Lopez et al., 2009; Blickenstorfer et al., 2011; N\u00f6remark et al., 2011) , to our knowledge there have been almost no published applications of the use of cattle movement network analysis for implementing a risk-based surveillance so far. There are many different network measures of centrality and, in 1979 in the context of social network analysis, Freeman discussed the importance of using meaningful and intuitively interpretable measures (Freeman, 1979) . For surveillance activities that target herds with an increased risk of disease due to ingoing live animal contacts, an intuitive focus would be measures of contacts that have actually occurred, rather than measures describing the relative role of the herd in connecting the entire network (e.g. different measures of betweenness). Inclusion of measures of betweenness may, on the other hand, be more applicable in models simulating spread of disease. There are different network analysis parameters describing incoming contacts that may be applied for risk-based surveillance purposes. For example, the 'in-degree' measure (Wasserman et al., 1994) describes the actual number of ingoing animal contacts for a herd. In addition, N\u00f6remark (2010) and N\u00f6remark et al. (2011) described the 'ingoing infection chain', which includes secondary contacts in sequences, taking into account the temporal aspect and the order in which these contacts have occurred (Fig. 1) .",

In order to investigate potential association between network analysis parameters and the presence of disease, results from a serological survey of BRSV and BCV in Swedish cattle were combined with data of reported animal movements. BRSV and BCV were used as a proxy for exotic diseases, or other serious infections under surveillance, with similar contagiousness and routes of transmission. In other words, the study was not designed to investigate risk factors for these specific diseases.

In addition to the in-degree and ingoing infection chain measures, herd size and regional cattle herd density were explanatory variables that were also investigated. The main effects models were decided based on univariable regression of each variable followed by a check of the correlation between explanatory variables, and multivariable regression with backward elimination of non-significant variables. The network analysis parameters were investigated separately in different models. For best fit of the models, both 'in-degree' and 'ingoing infection chain' were included in categorized form. The categories were 0, >0 to <5 and \u22655 for 'in-degree', and 0, >0 to <25 and \u226525 for 'ingoing infection chain'.

The 'in-degree' measure, which takes only direct contacts into account, was slightly more strongly associated with testing positive to BCV, compared Table 1 Results from univariable logistic regression analyses of the combined data from a cross-sectional study for bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) with network analysis measures of animal movements in 2137 Swedish dairy herds. to the 'ingoing infection chain' measure, where secondary contacts through sequence of movements are also incorporated. However, when comparing the exact values of influence of the two network analysis measures, it should be kept in mind that results can be expected to be highly dependent on the cut-offs used in the categorization of these parameters. For BRSV, none of the network analysis parameters were found to be significantly associated when herd size and regional cattle density were accounted for. Nevertheless, these measures could still be useful for risk-based sampling because buying animals can be a risk regardless of whether a herd also has other characteristics associated with disease introduction. This was illustrated in the comparison of selection strategies, where sampling strategies based on 'in-degree' detected more BRSV positives compared to random sampling. In fact, controlling for potential confounders such as herd size may not be appropriate in risk-based sampling, as pointed out by Willeberg and co-authors in this issue of Preventive Veterinary Medicine (Willeberg et al., 2012) . In many European countries, animal movements are continuously recorded, and obtaining network measures for the relevant time period based on these can provide a simple and straight forward tool for risk-based sampling, and also when information about other herd characteristics is missing. In a recent study, live animal contacts were recognized as a major risk for the spread of emerging infectious animal diseases and an increased need for Table 2 Results from multivariable logistic regression analyses of combined data from a cross-sectional study for bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and network analysis measures of animal movements in 2137 Swedish dairy herds.",

Especially in the first stages of an outbreak, or for diseases where animals do not show clear clinical symptoms, we see benefits from targeting herds with high measures of live animal contacts. Although BCV and BRSV were primarily used as general examples of contagious diseases, some of the findings in this study can be worthwhile mentioning in specific relation to BCV and BRSV. Both diseases can spread through other types of contacts, e.g. visitors such as veterinarians; and the relative importance of animal trade and farm visits has not been investigated in relation to these infections in Swedish beef cattle. Previous studies conducted in Norway and Sweden have evaluated the association between herd-level characteristics and BCV and BRSV infections in dairy herds. The identified risk factors were similar for both viruses: large herd size was found to be a risk factor compared with small herd size (Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 1999; Norstr\u00f6m et al., 2000) , as was artificial insemination (AI) by farm personnel compared with AI by external technicians, conventional compared with organic management (Bidokhti et al., 2009) , and not providing boots for visitors (Ohlson et al., 2010) . However, in the present study, animal trade seems to be more important for BCV than BRSV. This is an interesting finding that may be explained by the slightly different epidemiology of these two viral diseases. Signs of diarrhoea (the main symptom of BCV) might not be recorded by the farmer as easily as coughing (the main symptom of BRSV), so the risk of selling animals with ongoing BRSV infection might therefore be lower. The fact that BCV is shed via faeces (Clark, 1993) could also contribute, as it is difficult to clean out and more voluminous than nasal discharge, which is the primary means of transmission for BRSV (Van der Poel et al., 1994) .",

This means that on herd level some of our observations probably were false negatives. Because all serological results used here came from analysis of samples from young stock, presence of antibodies can be assumed to reflect a relatively recent infection. A truly positive animal could nevertheless be a false positive on herd level, i.e. if the animal was born elsewhere and had gone through infection before introduction to its current herd. The unique identities of the tested animals were not available to us and individual level factors, such as place of birth and time spent in the current herd, could therefore not be investigated.

The usefulness of these measures in the design of future surveillance activities will depend on the epidemiology of the disease studied. For example, 'ingoing infection chain' is expected to be more useful when included in risk-based surveillance of diseases such as bovine paratuberculosis, where infected animals often show few or no clinical symptoms. Many of the Swedish cattle herds have few direct contacts and 'indegree' and thus 'ingoing infection chain' do not always correspond (N\u00f6remark et al., 2011) , e.g. a holding with low 'in-degree' can have a high 'ingoing infection chain'. With a focus on 'in-degree' only, such herds may be excluded from sampling.",

Also, the time periods for which the network measures are calculated need to be adjusted depending on the disease studied and on the age category of the tested animals. For some diseases, the more recent contacts will be the most interesting whereas for others, with long incubation periods, e.g. such as scrapie or paratuberculosis, trade events several years back may be still be of great importance. Moreover, the measures out-degree and outgoing infection chain (Dub\u00e9 et al., 2008) can be used to identify outgoing contacts when the target of the surveillance is herds with a high risk of spreading disease.",
