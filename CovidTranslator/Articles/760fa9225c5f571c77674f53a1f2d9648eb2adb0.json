            "text": "B acterial pneumonia (BP) is an acquired inflammation of the lower airways and lung parenchyma secondary to bacterial infection. 1 The clinical characteristics and microbiological findings in dogs with BP have been well described. [2] [3] [4] [5] However, information concerning the normalization of clinical and radiographic findings during the recovery process and guidelines on assessing the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in BP still are limited. 1, 6, 7 Acute-phase proteins (APPs) are a group of blood proteins, mainly produced by the liver, which are part of the innate host defense system. 8 The APPs are involved in the protection against infection as well as in the regulation of the immune response and inflammation, especially in the early phases of injury. 9 The major positive APPs in dogs, C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA), have low serum concentrations in healthy dogs. Serum concentrations of CRP and SAA increase markedly within the first hours after inflammatory stimuli and normalize quickly during the recovery period. 9 The APPs have certain advantages in disease monitoring compared to the CBC. The numbers of blood leukocytes are largely affected by extravasation into the pulmonary parenchyma during acute BP, whereas APPs increase consistently with increasing inflammatory stimuli. 9 Minor and moderate positive APPs, such as haptoglobin (Hp), show a more gradual increase and decrease during the acute-phase response (APR). 8 The production of other plasma proteins, socalled negative APPs (such as albumin and transferrin), decreases during the APR. 8 Being nonspecific biomarkers of inflammation, increased serum concentrations of CRP, SAA, and Hp have been observed in dogs with a variety of infectious, immune-mediated and neoplastic diseases. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Despite the nonspecific nature of APPs, serum CRP can be useful in discriminating disease processes such as BP from other pulmonary diseases. 18 The APPs have been shown to decrease after initiation of successful treatment. 16, [19] [20] [21] Additionally, the increase in serum CRP during long-term follow-up in dogs with leishmaniasis and immune-mediated polyarthritis predicts the relapse of clinical disease. 14, 21 The utilization of CRP and SAA as possible prognostic biomarkers also has been studied in dogs, and most studies concluded that serum CRP or SAA concentrations at presentation could not predict clinical outcome. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] However, persistent increases in serum CRP after 48-72 hours of treatment were correlated with poor outcome. [22] [23] [24] Serum CRP has been widely studied in humans with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and its use as a diagnostic and follow-up biomarker is recommended by current treatment guidelines. 27, 28 Bacterial pneumonia currently is treated with markedly longer antimicrobial courses than is CAP, and effective means to estimate optimal treatment duration are lacking. 1, 6, 7, 29 Biomarker-guided antimicrobial treatment has been studied in humans with CAP by procalcitonin (PCT), a novel inflammatory biomarker, which indicated that PCT-guided antibiotic use decreased the duration of antimicrobial treatment without increasing the incidence of complications. [30] [31] [32] Similar studies assessing CRP-guided antimicrobial use in humans with CAP are lacking, but serum CRP has been shown to be useful in decreasing the duration of antimicrobial treatment in humans with neonatal septicemia without increasing the incidence of complications. 33, 34 The aim of our study was to describe the changes in clinical variables, thoracic radiographs, and APPs during a natural course of BP in dogs as well as comparing these variables between dogs with less severe BP requiring <2 days of hospitalization (lsBP) and more severe BP requiring >2 days of hospitalization (msBP). Additionally, the purpose of our study was to provide information concerning the application of APPs in the assessment of treatment response and to investigate whether serum CRP measurements can aid in the estimation of antimicrobial treatment duration in dogs with BP.",

            "text": "All measured positive APPs were significantly increased in dogs with BP at presentation compared to healthy controls. This finding is in agreement with previous reports describing CRP and SAA in dogs with BP. 10, 18, 45 Haptoglobin concentrations have not been reported previously, but because significant increases in serum Hp have been reported 24 hours after an inflammatory stimulus, increased concentrations also were expected in BP. 9 However, it must be emphasized that APPs are highly nonspecific inflammatory markers and, in addition to BP, increased concentrations may be encountered in a variety of disease processes. 8, 9 As expected, all positive APPs (CRP, SAA, Hp) correlated positively with each other. However, a negative correlation with albumin did not occur in all comparisons. This is most likely due to the long half-life of albumin, resulting in a late response not noticeable in acute BP. 9 Serum APP concentrations at presentation did not differ significantly in dogs with lsBP and msBP. Additionally, serum CRP, SAA, or Hp at presentation did not correlate significantly with markers of disease severity, such as arterial PaO 2 and the duration of hospitalization. Initial serum CRP, SAA, or Hp concentrations in dogs with BP therefore may not be useful indicators of disease severity. A similar observation has been made in studies describing CRP in human patients with CAP. 46, 47 C-reactive protein and SAA rapidly decreased after initiation of treatment (Fig 2A,B) . These findings indicate that CRP and SAA are useful markers of treatment response. Haptoglobin showed a more gradual increase and decrease and therefore did not reflect clinical recovery as well as CRP and SAA. Because there is a wider range of concentrations and the magnitude of change is more pronounced in SAA compared to CRP, SAA might be a better diagnostic and follow-up marker than CRP in dogs with BP, as already suggested by a recent study comparing CRP and SAA as diagnostic markers of systemic inflammation. 45 Healthy < 2d hosp. > 2d hosp. C-reactive protein continued to increase within the first 24 hours in 5 dogs. This is not unexpected because dogs with BP were presented acutely and CRP is known to reach peak concentrations approximately 24 hours after the onset of an inflammatory stimulus. 48 Consequently, it is not meaningful to interpret the possible CRP decrease as early as 24 hours after initiation of treatment. However, a decrease in serum CRP is expected 48-72 hours after initiation of successful treatment, and a failure to show a decrease has been associated with a poor prognosis in dogs with systemic inflammatory conditions. [22] [23] [24] Consecutive measurements of CRP have been to be found useful in humans with CAP, and the magnitude of CRP decrease at days 3 and 4 has been shown to have prognostic value. 49-51 A connection also has been shown between the pattern of serum CRP concentrations and outcome in humans. Patients with persistently high CRP (so-called nonresponse) or an increase in serum CRP after an initial decrease (so-called biphasic response) during the first days of hospitalization had a poor prognosis. 52 In our study, the CRP ratio, describing the magnitude of decrease after 48 or 72 hours, did not correlate with the duration of hospitalization. This finding could be a consequence of the small number of samples available for CRP measurement at 72 hours: Only 5 dogs with msBP were still alive and hospitalized 72 hours after presentation. Another limitation concerns the method used for CRP measurements. The upper detection limit for the assay used was 210 mg/L, and measurements exceeding this concentration were set at 211 mg/L. Doing so underestimated the increase in serum CRP, because it has been shown that serum CRP can increase markedly above 211 mg/L in dogs with aspiration pneumonia. 45 This approach will affect the interpretation of the CRP ratio during the recovery process. These limitations make the interpretation of the CRP ratio in our study less informative. One dog, which was euthanized because of refractory BP, had a biphasic CRP response pattern similar to that described in connection with poor prognosis in humans with CAP. 52 Regarding other variables, dogs with msBP were characterized by a more pronounced left shift and lymphopenia and were significantly more hypoxemic. Respiratory samples in dogs with msBP were characterized by significantly more pronounced neutrophilia, eosinopenia, and lymphopenia compared to dogs with lsBP. These variables therefore could be useful as early markers aiding in the identification of dogs with a more severe course of BP. Escherichia coli as a causative agent additionally was correlated with a more severe course of BP. Moreover, coagulation abnormalities were detected only in dogs with msBP caused by E. coli. These findings likely are due to endotoxin produced by E. coli, affecting hemodynamics, blood clotting, and cellular and humoral immunity. 53 A similar finding of increased disease severity has been described in E. coli-induced CAP. 54 Additionally, prolonged aPTT has been correlated with a worse prognosis in both humans and dogs with systemic inflammation or sepsis. 55, 56 Initial radiographic findings were consistent with previously reported findings in dogs with BP. 2, 3 The resolution of the alveolar lung pattern was followed during hospitalization and follow-up visits. However, because thoracic radiographs were not repeated daily, an exact time point for the resolution could not be determined. Alveolar infiltrates resolved relatively rapidly in our study (69% of dogs had cleared alveolar infiltrates by day 10) compared to studies of humans. Only 33% of human patients with CAP had clearance of radiographic Table 2 . Comparison of demographic, clinical, and respiratory cytology findings at presentation in dogs with less severe bacterial pneumonia (BP) (requiring <2 days of hospitalization, n = 10) and more severe BP (requiring >2 days of hospitalization, n = 9, including 2 mortalities). infiltrates at day 7 and 62% at day 28, and it also has been shown that radiographic normalization lags behind clinical cure as assessed by physicians. 57, 58 With CAP, current research has not been able to show benefits for routinely repeating thoracic radiographs after clinical recovery. [57] [58] [59] Repeating thoracic radiographs during and after hospitalization therefore is not recommended in patients with uncomplicated recovery. 27 Additional information gained by thoracic radiographs, especially after the clearance of alveolar infiltrates, was minimal in our study in dogs with otherwise satisfactory clinical recovery. Antimicrobial treatment currently is recommended for 3-6 weeks or 1-2 weeks beyond the resolution of radiographic changes. 1, 6, 7 Markedly shorter antimicrobial courses are used in CAP. Antibiotics are recommended for 7-10 days in cases of mild-to-moderate CAP, and the use of biomarkers has proved useful in determining optimal treatment duration. 27, [29] [30] [31] 33, 34, 60 No published clinical studies exist addressing the optimal duration of antimicrobials in dogs with BP, and current recommendations may overestimate the treatment duration needed, especially in uncomplicated cases. Considering the variety of infectious agents and the individual differences in the interactions between microbe and the host immune system, a need also exists in dogs with BP for customizing antibiotic treatment duration according to disease severity and response rate. In our study, normalization of CRP was used to guide duration of antimicrobial treatment in 8 of 17 dogs and resulted in significantly decreased treatment duration compared to 9 of 17 conventionally treated dogs. It would have been ideal to randomize the chosen treatment regimen and stratify the randomization according to disease severity. Instead, conventional treatment was used at the beginning of the study, because previous information on the applicability of CRP to predict treatment duration was lacking. When clinical experience was gained and serum CRP was found to reflect the recovery process well, it was considered safe to stop administering antibiotics after CRP normalization. Ending antimicrobials at the point of CRP normalization was still considered premature and, to increase safety, antimicrobials were administered for 5-7 days after CRP normalization. Relapses of BP were not noted in dogs receiving a CRP-guided course of antibiotics, and therefore, the approach appears to be safe. However, because the incidence of relapse was low in both groups, our study was not able to identify an optimal end point for antimicrobial treatment and even shorter courses than those used in the CRP-guided group may have been sufficient in dogs with BP. Additionally, the small number of dogs and lack of randomization are limitations, and larger randomized studies are warranted.",

            "text": "-C. In 3 dogs, initial serum CRP concentrations exceeded the upper detection limit for the assay (>210 mg/L) were set at 211 mg/L. Three dogs had received exogenous glucocorticoids (a single PO dose of prednisolone or hydrocortisone [2/3] and daily inhaled fluticasone [1/3]) before inclusion and 1 dog was diagnosed with Cushing's disease after the study period. Serum CRP and SAA (r = 0.60, P = .015), CRP and Hp (r = 0.61, P = .010) as well as SAA and Hp (r = 0.85, P < .001) at presentation were significantly positively correlated. Serum amyloid A concentration was significantly negatively correlated with serum albumin concentration (r = \u00c00.53, P = .035), but CRP (r = \u00c00.22, P = .40) and Hp (r = \u00c00.15, P = .58) were not. Serum APPs at presentation were not significantly correlated with variables of disease severity, such as duration of hospitalization (CRP: r = 0.36, P = .24; SAA: r = 0.462, P = .072; Hp: r = 0.305, P = .235), arterial PaO 2 (CRP: r = 0.353, P = .138; SAA: r = \u00c00.450, P = .080; Hp: r = \u00c00.48, P = .052), or A-aO 2 (CRP: r = 0.35, P = .14; SAA: r = 0.42, P = .11; Hp: r = 0.42, P = .090).Changes in serum CRP, SAA, Hp, and in arterial PaO 2 during the follow-up period are presented inFigure 2A-D.The CRP ratio was calculated for hospitalized patients at 24 hours (median, 1.0; interquartile range [IQR], 0.6-2.2; n = 11), 48 hours (median, 0.95; IQR, 0.8-1.1; n = 8), and 72 hours (median, 1.0; IQR, 0.8-1.2; n = 5). C-reactive protein concentration continued to increase in the first 24 hours in 5 of 11 dogs. The CRP ratios after 24 hours (r = 0.35, P = .30), 48 hours (r = 0.46, P = .25), and 72 hours (r = \u00c00.15, P = .81) were not correlated with the duration of hospitalization.",
