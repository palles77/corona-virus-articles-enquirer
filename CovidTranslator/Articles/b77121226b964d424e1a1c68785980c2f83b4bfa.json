The etiologic agent, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; Bunyaviridae, Phlebovirus) is primarily transmitted through mosquito bites, but can also be transmitted by exposure to infectious aerosols. There are presently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics to prevent or treat severe RVFV infection in humans. We have previously reported on the activity of favipiravir (T-705) against the MP-12 vaccine strain of RVFV and other bunyaviruses in cell culture. In addition, efficacy has also been documented in mouse and hamster models of infection with the related Punta Toro virus. Here, we challenged hamsters with the highly pathogenic ZH501 strain of RVFV to evaluate the activity of favipiravir against lethal infection. Subcutaneous RVFV challenge resulted in substantial serum and tissue viral loads and caused severe disease and mortality within 2-3 days after infection. Oral favipiravir (200 mg/kg/day) prevented mortality in 60% or greater in hamsters challenged with RVFV when administered within 1 or 6 h post-exposure and reduced RVFV titers in serum and tissues relative to the time of treatment initiation. In contrast, although ribavirin (75 mg/kg/day) was effective at protecting animals from the peracute RVFV disease, most ultimately succumbed from a delayed-onset neurologic disease associated with high RVFV burden in the brain observed in moribund animals. When combined, T-705 and ribavirin treatment started 24 h post-infection significantly improved survival outcome and reduced serum and tissue virus titers compared to monotherapy. Our findings demonstrate significant post-RVFV exposure efficacy with favipiravir against both peracute disease and delayed-onset neuroinvasion, and suggest added benefit when combined with ribavirin.",

However, due to concerns with dose-related hemolytic anemia and possible teratogenic effects, ribavirin is only approved for compassionate use under investigational new drug protocols (Borio et al., 2002; Snell, 2001) .",

T-705RTP functions as a purine nucleotide analog that selectively inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the influenza virus (Furuta et al., 2005; Jin et al., 2013; Sangawa et al., 2013) . T-705 has demonstrated a 150-fold weaker inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase than ribavirin, and unlike ribavirin it does not interfere with DNA or RNA synthesis. The specificity of T-705 likely contributes to its low toxicity. The compound is presently in clinical development as an influenza inhibitor in Japan (New Drug Application filed) and the United States (Phase 3 clinical trial).",

Punta Toro virus (PTV), a more accessible and less biohazardous agent (biosafety level 2; BSL-2) belonging to the same genus as RVFV, has been used to model severe RVFV infection in different animal models (Anderson et al., 1990; Fisher et al., 2003; Pifat and Smith, 1987) . Consequently, initial studies evaluated the efficacy of T-705 in PTV infection models (Gowen et al., 2007; Gowen et al., 2010) .

The African green monkey kidney cell line, Vero 76, was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA) and maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific HyClone, Logan, UT). For in vitro antiviral assays, the serum was reduced to 2% FBS and gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 50 \u00b5g/ml.",

Half-log dilutions of T-705 and ribavirin were added in triplicate to test wells at the time of infection with the highest test compound concentrations starting at 1000 \u00b5M. For toxicity determinations, drugs were added in the absence of virus infection. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 until virus-infected control wells were observed to have > 90% CPE (day 3). The neutral red (NR) assay to measure cell viability was performed as previously described (Kumaki et al., 2011) . Briefly, the supernatants were removed for virus yield reduction (VYR) assays and infected cells and controls were subsequently stained with 0.011% NR solution for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . After incubation, the NR solution was removed, the wells were rinsed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), and the incorporated dye extracted using ethanol buffered with Sorenson's citrate buffer. The plates were read at 405 (primary) and 540 (reference) nanometer wavelengths using a Opsys MR\u2122 microplate reader (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA) to quantitate the extracted NR. The absorbance values were expressed as percentages of untreated, uninfected controls, which took up maximal dye. The values obtained were converted to percentages of untreated, uninfected controls. The 50% cell cytotoxic dose (CC 50 ) and 50% virus effective dose (EC 50 ), representing the concentration at which 50% of the monolayers would show compound cytotoxicity or viral CPE, respectively, were estimated by regression analysis. The selectivity index (SI) was calculated using the formula: SI = CC 50 /EC 50 . For the VYR assays, viral titers were determined by endpoint dilution (Reed and Muench, 1938) . The VYR data are presented as the concentration of drug that reduced the virus yield by 1 log 10 unit (EC 90 ) based on linear regression analysis, with SI values determined as the CC 50 /EC 90 .",

As in the initial experiment, animals receiving high-dose T-705 treatments initiated 1 hpi fared significantly better compared to the ribavirin-treated animals (P < 0.001; 70% vs. 10% survival), which survived the acute infection but ultimately succumbed to a late-onset neurologic disease ( Figure 4A) .

Several T-705 and ribavirin regimens (Table 1) were tested with treatment initiated at 24 hpi. Because ribavirin treatment courses commonly employ a \"loading dose\" strategy (Borio et al., 2002; McCormick et al., 1986) , we designed the combination study with this consideration in mind.

Despite similar inhibitory concentrations in the cell culture experiments, T-705 was superior to ribavirin in terms of overall survival and preventing late-onset CNS infection in RVFV-infected hamsters. Although a detailed characterization of the hamster model is lacking, similar pathological changes to those described in mice have been reported. The liver is the principal target with severe hepatic disease the likely cause of death during the acute infection with a delayed-onset encephalitic disease developing after the first week (Niklasson et al., 1984; Smith et al., 2010) . Hamsters generally succumb within 2-3 days from acute disease, whereas mortality in mice occurs during the first 3-6 days (Ikegami and Makino, 2011) . While both both species are highly susceptible to RVFV, neither reproduces the hemorrhagic fever or ocular disease observed in human cases. The rapid progression of disease in hamsters presents challenges in terms of the abbreviated therapeutic window; however, the model is very useful for evaluating experimental therapies in the context of post-exposure intervention and to demonstrate proof-of-concept in a robust small animal model. It is possible that doses higher than 200 mg/kg/day of T-705 may have achieved complete protection against lethal RVFV challenge in hamsters. The present dose of 200 mg/kg/day is equivalent to a human dose of 27 mg/kg/day based on body surface area conversion (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2008) . In the Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating T-705 as an antiinfluenza drug, the high dose arm consisted of 2400 mg on day 1 and 1600 mg on days 2-5. Assuming the average weight of the participants was 60 kg, the dosages received were in the range of 40 and 27 mg/kg/day, respectively. Although a 400 mg/kg/day loading dose with subsequent transition to 200 mg/kg/day was evaluated in the 3 rd study, the therapeutic window for T-705 in the hamster model appears not to extend much further than beyond 6 h. Considering the excellent tolerability of T-705 in hamsters (LD 50 >1500 mg/kg/day) (Gowen et al., 2007) , and the severity of the RVFV infection, it may be worthwhile to explore higher daily doses administered three times per day to obtain more consistent therapeutic levels systemically and in tissues.",

T-705 was more effective in terms of protecting the animals from both acute and late-onset CNS disease, but the window for successful post-exposure intervention was limited to approximately 6 h. In contrast, ribavirin was highly effective at protecting all animals from the rapidly overwhelming effects of the acute infection, even when delaying treatment until 24 hpi, whereas only a slight beneficial effect could be observed with T-705 treatments. However, almost all ribavirin-treated animals ultimately succumbed to CNS infection and associated disease in the absence of detectable levels of virus in serum or liver and spleen samples. These findings are consistent with a well characterized mouse RVFV infection model wherein late-onset neuroinvasion and encephalitis was described in animals succumbing during the latter part of the infection (Smith et al., 2010) . This secondary disease observed in hamsters could serve as a model for human cases of delayed-onset encephalitis that occur weeks to months after acute RVFV infection (Ikegami and Makino, 2011) .",

Ribavirin may achieve higher concentrations and activation in the primary lymphatic tissues where the virus is likely to initially replicate before seeding the blood and secondary target organs including the liver. We can only speculate as to why T-705 is able to prevent CNS infection, but has a narrower window for intervention. The complexities with the biodistribution of the parent T-705 compound, the efficiency of its intracellular conversion to the active ribofuranosyl triphosphate in various cell types and tissues, and the rate of elimination all probably influence the observed efficacy and the shorter window for effective intervention. T-705 is likely to specifically target the RVFV polymerase directly affecting the virus life cycle by inhibiting viral transcription and replication, whereas ribavirin has multiple modes of action and may prevent RVFV lethality through later acting cumulative effects from depletion of ribonucleotide pools (Leyssen et al., 2008) .",

Despite this success, the challenge of preventing late-onset encephalitis when treatment is postponed until 24 h after RVFV infection in hamsters is still largely unmet. Interestingly, our findings hint that the highest dose combination of T-705 and ribavirin was not necessarily optimal (only 10% survival), as treatments where the dose of one of the drugs was lowered resulted in improved (40%) survival outcomes. A comprehensive drug combination matrix would be needed to clearly demonstrate possible antagonism at higher doses, as well as synergy with suboptimal dosing regimens of T-705 and ribavirin.",

In fatal cases of RVF, severe hemorrhagic disease manifestations typically lead to death within 3-6 days of the onset of clinical signs of illness (Ikegami and Makino, 2011) . Because hamsters succumb to the acute phase of the infection within a day of displaying initial clinical signs (lethargy, hunched posture, and ruffled fur), it is difficult to extrapolate to the human disease. However, considering the rapid progression and lethality of RVFV infection and disease modeled in hamsters, the data presented are certainly encouraging. In view of the failure of ribavirin to prevent CNS infection in mice challenged through the upper respiratory tract (Reed et al., 2013) , future studies investigating the efficacy of T-705 against aerosol exposure in rodents is warranted. Ultimately, investigational new drug-enabling efficacy studies in a nonhuman primate model of RVF will be required for advancing the compound towards clinical evaluation.",
