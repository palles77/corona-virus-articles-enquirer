Treatment of mice with anti-CXCL10 neutralizing antibody results in limited CD4+ T cell infiltration into the CNS accompanied by a reduction in white matter damage. The current study determines the antigen-specificity of the T lymphocytes present during chronic disease and evaluates how blocking CXCL10 signaling affects retention of virusspecific T cells within the CNS. CXCL10 neutralization selectively reduced accumulation and/or retention of virus-specific CD4+ T cells, yet exhibited limited effect on virus-specific CD8+ T cells. The response of CXCL10 neutralization on virus-specific T cell subsets is not due to differential expression of the CXCL10 receptor CXCR3 on T cells as there was no appreciable difference in receptor expression on virus-specific T cells during either acute or chronic disease. These findings emphasize the importance of virus-specific CD4+ T cells in amplifying demyelination in JHMVinfected mice. In addition, differential signals are required for trafficking and retention of virusspecific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during chronic demyelination in JHMV-infected mice.",

Chemokines and chemokine receptors are involved in the generation, activation and recruitment of virus-specific T cells following injury, microbial infection or during autoimmune diseases [1] [2] [3] . Accumulating data demonstrate that chemokines play a crucial role in promoting inflammation in tissues originally considered immunologically inert, such as the CNS, resulting in either protection and/or pathology [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .

The immune response to JHMV following intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation of susceptible mice involves CNS infiltration of NK cells, macrophages and T lymphocytes [14] . Both CD4 + and CD8+ T cells are required for viral clearance from the infected brain and infiltrating T lymphocytes recognize specific viral epitopes residing within structural proteins [15] [16] [17] . Following infection of C57BL/6 mice, the immunodominant CD4+ epitope is found at residues 133-147 of the membrane (M) protein (M133-147) and additional CD4+ T cell epitopes are found in the spike (S) surface glycoprotein (S328-347 and S358-372) [15, 17] . Two defined CD8+ T cell epitopes have been identified and reside within the S protein. These epitopes include the immunodominant S510-518 as well as the S598-605 [15, 16] . Infectious virus is reduced below detectable levels within the CNS through the release IFN-\u03b3 and perforin by infiltrating T cells, but sterile immunity is not achieved [18] [19] [20] . Viral RNA and antigen persists in white matter tracts of mice that survive the acute infection and these mice develop a chronic demyelinating disease characterized by mononuclear cell infiltration and myelin destruction that is similar to the pathology associated with the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) [18] .",

When CXCL10-specific neutralizing antiserum was administered to mice with established demyelination, reduced pathology and improved neurological function were observed [9] . Concomitant with reduced pathology, was a significant reduction in CD4+ T cell invasion of the CNS. Anti-CXCL10 treatment, however, did not significantly hinder the ability of total CD8+ T cells to accumulate within the CNS [9] . These data suggest that CXCL10 can exert a selective effect on T cell subsets regulating CNS infiltration and disease progression.

We previously determined that administration of an anti-CXCL10 blocking antibody to mice persistently infected with JHMV resulted in diminished CD4+ T cell infiltration into the CNS yet such treatment did not reduce overall numbers of CD8+ T cells [9] . These findings suggested the possibility of differential expression of CXCR3 on T cells during chronic JHMV-induced demyelination. To address this possibility, C57BL/6 mice were i.c. infected with virus and CXCR3 expression on T cells within the brain was assessed by flow cytometry at days 7, 12, and 21 p.i. Antigen specificity was defined by IFN-\u03b3 production in response to peptide stimulation. Data shown in Figure 1 indicate that ~90% of CD4+ T cells recognizing the immunodominant M133-147 epitope were CXCR3-positive at each time point analyzed. Similarly, 90% of CD8+ recognizing the S510-518 epitope present within the CNS at days 7 and 12 p.i. expressed CXCR3 and declined slightly to ~80% by 21 days p.i. (Figure 1 ). Finally, greater than 90% of CD8+ T cells recognizing the S598-605 epitope were CXCR3-positive at all time times examined ( Figure 1 ). Therefore, these data indicate that CXCR3 is expressed on the vast majority of inflammatory virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells within the CNS of JHMV-infected mice during both acute and chronic disease. Further, there is not a dramatic reduction in the frequency of CXCR3-positive virus-specific cells between days 12 and 21 p.i.",

Anti-CXCL10 treatment resulted in a reduction of total CD4+ and CD8 + T cells (90% and 71%, respectively) within the brain at 15 days p.i. (Figure 2A ). By 21 days p.i., CD4+ T cells within the brain were greatly reduced (73%), but antibody treatment had very little affect on total CD8+ T cell accrual (17%) which is consistent with previously reported data (Figure 2A ) [9] . CXCL10 neutralization resulted in greater than 90% reductions in M133-147-and S358-372-virus-specific CD4+ T cells within the brain at 15 days p.i. compared to NRS treatment ( Figure 2B) . Additionally, at day 15 p.i., CD4+ T cells specific for S328-347 was reduced by 70% following anti-CXCL10 treatment ( Figure 2B ). CD4+ T cells specific for M133-147, S328-347 and S358-372 were decreased by at least 50% at 21 days p.i. as a result of CXCL10 neutralization ( Figure 2B ). Analysis of CD8+ T cells specific for the immunodominant epitope S510-518 in the brains of mice treated with anti-CXCL10 revealed a reduction at day 15 p.i., but a 2-fold increase in numbers of CD8+ T cells specific for this epitope in anti-CXCL10 treated mice at 21 days p.i.

Evaluation of total T cell accumulation within the spinal cord revealed that, similar to the brain, anti-CXCL10 treatment results in a dramatic reduction in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets (81% and 89%, respectively) at 15 days p.i. ( Figure 3A ). However, at 21 days p.i., the reduction in total CD4 + T cells within the spinal cord as a result of CXCL10 neutralization is more pronounced than that of total CD8+ T cells (CD4, 90% reduction; CD8, 66% reduction) ( Figure 3A ). Anti-CXCL10 treatment resulted in reduced infiltration of both M133-147 and S328-347 virus specific CD4+ T cells in the spinal cords at both days 15 and 21 p.i. (Figure 3B ). CD4+ T cells specific for the S358-372 epitope in the spinal cords of mice treated with anti-CXCL10 were greatly reduced (67%) at 15 days p.i, compared to NRS treated animals, but by 21 days p.i., only a moderate reduction (36%) was observed ( Figure 3B ). Anti-CXCL10 treatment had very little effect on accumulation of CD8+ T cells specific for S510-518 or S598-605 epitopes in the spinal cord at day 15 p.i. ( Figure 3C ). However, at 21 days p.i., there was a slight increase in the numbers of S510-specific CD8+ T cells (35%) and a notable reduction in S598-specific CD4+ T cells (69%) in the spinal cords of anti-CXCL10 treated mice similar to what was observed in the brain ( Figure 3C ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that antibody-mediated blocking of CXCL10 exerts a greater effect on the accumulation of both total and virus-specific CD4+ T cells compared to CD8+ T cells during the chronic stage of disease. Upon removal of anti-CXCL10 treatment, inflammatory CD4+ T lymphocytes migrate back into the CNS and participate in myelin destruction [9] . Therefore, we next determined if the return of demyelination following removal of anti-CXCL10 treatment coincided with the presence of virus-specific T cells. Infected mice were treated with anti-CXCL10 antisera from days 12 to 21 p.i. at which point antibody treatment was stopped and the presence of virus-specific T cells within the CNS determined at day 28 p.i. There were no differences in numbers of total T cells ( Figure 4A ) or virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells ( Figure 4B ) at day 28 p.i. between the groups treated with either anti-CXCL10 or NRS.",

Chemokines play a role in this process by establishing a gradient originating within the CNS that subsequently attracts distinct cell populations [7] [8] [9] 21, 25, [28] [29] [30] [31] . The current study has further defined the viral specificity of T cells infiltrating the CNS during chronic JHMV infection and evaluated the effects CXCL10 neutralization has on individual virus-specific T cell populations. Consistent with earlier studies, the data clearly indicate that during persistent JHMV infection, anti-CXCL10 treatment selectively inhibits CNS accumulation of total CD4+ T cells, but not total CD8+ T cells [9] . Moreover, these findings also support and extend earlier studies indicating that CXCL10 expression within the CNS of JHMV-infected mice functions to attract T cells [8, 9, 24] . Virus-specific CD4+ T cells and S598-605-specific CD8+ T cells are hindered in their ability to enter the CNS during anti-CXCL10 treatment, but CD8+ T cells specific for the immunodominant epitope, S510-518, are not restricted access.",

Studies by Klein and colleagues [32] demonstrated that CXCL10 is required for optimal recruitment of CXCR3-expressing effector T cells to the brains of West Nile virus-infected mice. Specifically, CXCR3-expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly reduced in CXCL10-deficient mice compared to wild-type suggesting that CXCR3 expression dictates which cells respond to CXCL10 [32] . Interestingly, examination of CXCR3 expression on antigen-specific T cells in the brains of MHV-infected mice revealed that the differential accumulation of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells following anti-CXCL10 treatment was not due to variable CXCR3 expression on specific T cell populations. Therefore, we suggest that the CXCL10:CXCR3 signaling axis is not critical in directing S510-518 antigen-specific CD8+ T cells into the CNS in mice persistently infected with JHMV. Importantly, these data support a recent study from our laboratory demonstrating that blocking CXCR3 with neutralizing antibody selectively inhibits CD4+ T cell accumulation in the CNS [11] .",

It is possible that T cells specific to the immunodominant CD8+ epitope respond to different chemotactic signals. Previous studies show that CCL5 is important for attracting S510-518 virus-specific CD8+ T cells into the CNS during chronic JHMV infection [28] . Mice persistently infected with MHV and treated with CCL5 neutralizing antibody resulted in reduced CNS accrual of total S510-518-specific CD8+ T cells at 21 days p.i. [28] . These data imply that trafficking of this CD8+ T cell subset into the CNS is more responsive to CCL5 than CXCL10. Alternatively, studies by Bergmann and colleagues have shown that S510-518specific CD8+ T cells are selectively retained in the CNS [33] . Therefore, S510-518-specific CD8+ T cells may not be affected by the absence of CXCL10 because this is the dominant CD8+ T cell viral epitope thus likely to be the most accessible and easily recognized, resulting in retention of this subset in the CNS during anti-CXCL10 treatment.",

This result leads to an important question pertaining to the fate of these T cell subsets during antibody treatment. It is possible that the affected T cell populations die and that the cells that are found in the CNS following removal of anti-CXCL10 treatment are newly generated in the periphery. We believe this unlikely, as MHV viral RNA is not detected within peripheral lymphoid tissue during chronic disease (data not shown) [33] . A more probable possibility is that the affected T cell populations are retained in the periphery and then return to the CNS once antibody administration is ablated. Importantly, these studies reveal that CXCL10 expression specifically attracts defined T cell populations to the CNS. The implication of these findings is that anti-CXCL10 treatment is potentially more selective in inducing the migration of targeted populations of cells to a site of microbial infection.",
