The identity and high purity of compound 1 were confirmed by elemental analysis, NMR, IR analysis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The compound 1, evaluated in HepG 2.2.15 cells expressing permanently HBV, significantly reduced the levels of HBV antigens and HBV DNA in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. EC 50 values were determined to be 54 lM for HBeAg, 61 lM for HBsAg and 2.66 lM for supernatant HBV DNA, as compared to 1671, 1570, 169 lM, respectively, for the commercially-available hepatitis B drug adefovir dipivoxil (ADV). Intracellular cccDNA, pgRNA and HBcAg were also found to be decreased by compound 1 in a concentration-dependent manner. Cytotoxicity results showed that compound 1 has low toxicity in HepG 2 cells with CC 50 value of 515.20 lM. The results indicate that compound 1 can efficiently inhibit HBV replication in HepG 2.2.15 cells line in vitro. Additionally, compound 1 also shows high anti-SARS activity at an EC 50 of 7.08 lM and toxicity with a CC 50 of 118.6 lM against MDCK cells.",

More than 400 million people worldwide are currently infected with hepatitis B virus. Approximately 20% of HBV patients will develop chronic hepatitis, and are at significant risk of developing cirrhosis or liver hepatocarcinoma. HBV is the prototype of hepadnaviridae, a family of small enveloped hepatotropic DNA viruses that can infect the liver of human (Marion and Robinson, 1983) . Chronic hepatitis B patients are commonly treated with either interferon alpha (INF-a), or the nucleoside analog lamivudine (3TC), adefovir, entecavir or telbivudine which are the synthetic reverse transcrip-tase inhibitors (De Clercq, 1999; Delmas et al., 2002; Buster and Janssen, 2006) . However, none of these therapies are completely safe and effective. Although direct antiviral therapy with amivudine or adefovir could efficiently control chronic active hepatitis B, drug resistance or renal toxicity could develop progressively several months after the initiation of therapy. It is thus still urgently required to identify effective anti-HBV agents.",

These complexes have shown potential applications in multitudinal fields such as catalysis, medicine and functional materials M\u00fcller, 1991, 1994) . Especially, the medicinal properties of POMs have been a subject of interest (Witvrouw et al., 2000; Judd et al., 2001; Shigeta et al., 2003; Yamase, 2005) . These compounds have low toxicity for cultured cells, and relatively less expensive than the ''chemical'' antiviral drugs. Recently, POMs have been reported to inhibit the replication of RNA viruses and DNA viruses in vitro and in vivo, such as the human immunodeficiency virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, influenza virus and herpes simplex virus (Rhule et al., 1998; Dan et al., 2002) . The activity of POMs against hepatitis B virus was also suggested by Zoulim (1999) . The mechanism of action of POMs remains to be fully elucidated, but may occur at any of the life cycle stages, including viral adsorption, penetration, or reverse-transcription (Dan et al., 2002; Shigeta et al., (Domaille and Knoth, 1983; Ozeki and Yamase, 1991) shows high antiviral activity. The interesting biological results of [PW 10 Ti 2 O 40 ] 7\u00c0 prompted us to explore the antiviral activity of compounds containing [PW 10 Ti 2 O 40 ] 7\u00c0 anions as potential anti-HBV agents.",

After a 24 h period of incubation, SARS virus stock (0.1 mL per well) and different doses of compound 1 (0.1 mL per well) were added. In the control group, 0.1 mL medium was added. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere for 2 days until maximum cytopathic effects were observed in the untreated, negative control cultures. The cytopathic effects were quantitated by the MTT assay. Briefly, 30 lL of MTT solution prepared in DMEM was added to each well and plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. The MTT solution was removed without disturbing the cells and 60 lL of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve formazan crystals. After gently shaking the plates for 5 min, the absorbance from each well was measured at 540 nm. The percentages of protection were calculated as [(A \u00c0 B)/(C \u00c0 B) \u00c2 100], where A, B, and C stand for the absorbances of wells containing compound 1 and virus (A), virus (B) and cell (C) only, respectively.",

This result shows that compound 1 has a sustained anti-HBV activity. The levels of intracellular HBV DNA, RNA and HBcAg protein were also reduced by compound 1 in a concentration-dependent manner.

It is also important to consider that the HBV pgRNA was inhibited in drugtreated cells (He et al., 2008) .

In summary, a heteropolytungstate has been prepared and characterized. The in vitro experimental results show that compound 1 has potential anti-HBV and anti-SARS virus activities. Further experiments are underway now, which include evaluation of in vivo activities and determination of the mechanism of anti-HBV activity of compound 1.",
