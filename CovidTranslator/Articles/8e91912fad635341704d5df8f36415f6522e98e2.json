Covid-19 is mainly transmitted from human-to-human by respiratory droplets and close contact, and may also be transmitted through fecal mouth and aerosol. 5, 6 The clinical manifestations of Covid-19 are very similar to SARS, and patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is highly likely to require intensive care and even lead to death. 7 Since January 2020, the Covid-19 has spread rapidly from Wuhan to other parts of China and other countries around the world. [8] [9] [10] As of March 13, 2020, a total of 132,758 laboratory-confirmed cases (80,991 in China) and 4955 deaths (3180 in China) had been reported worldwide. 11 With the increasing number of confirmed and suspected cases globally, the situation of disease prevention and control is extremely critical.",

Consistent with previous findings, 15, 23 we found that the older and patients with comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes and CVD) were more likely to develop severe illness. All death in patients (5 imported cases and 1 local case) have a kind of comorbidity, 2 of them have two comorbidities. The possible reason may be the chronic course of hypertension and diabetes leading consistent damage to the micro-vascular walls, resulting in both inefficacy of immune cell infiltration and drug deliver into lung areas. 24,25 In our study, 8 patients were young patients aged 0 to 17 years, the youngest was 3 months and 19 days, and the oldest was 17 years old.",

The radiological abnormalities are a part of diagnosis, all patients have lesion in radiology, and the radiological progression of Covid-19 in severe patient is gradual.The initial radiological lesion are patchy shadows in bilateral or unilateral lower lungs in outer bands, and then progress to 1/3 of both lower lungs, then involve both upper lungs, and eventually develop into \"white lung\".

The oxygen therapies are of vital importance for the progressive Covid-19, because ARDS is common complication in severe Covid-19 patients, the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio is clinical predictor in both severity and mortality. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio of Cocid-19 patients indicated the effect of oxygenation and the response to current therapies against hypoxemia. For the critical illness in adults in Hainan, the common reason of severe patients bears a long waiting time for diagnosis and intensive treatments, including a long time from onset to consultation or a long time from the suspect to laboratory-confirmed. The rapid progress in severe patients illustrates the importance of shorten time of each step, so a bundle of consecutive steps including early test, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment for Covid-19 patients might have contributed to a favorable outcome.
