Several treatment modalities were tried with limited success to treat SARS and a variety of experimental drugs are under development. Type I interferons (IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2) were suggested as potential candidates to treat SARS. Several animal and human coronaviruses, including SCV, were shown to be sensitive to IFNs both in vitro and in vivo. A pilot clinical report showed effectiveness of IFN-\u03b1 for the treatment of SARS patients. This review summarises antiviral activities of IFNs with special regard to SARS, and reviews the published clinical and experimental data describing the use of IFNs for SARS.",

However, the significant in vivo toxicity of ribavirin [11] and its limited antiviral activity in Vero cells infected with different SCV strains [12] did not encourage ribavirin treatment of patients infected with SCV.

Type I IFNs have functional, but no structural, similarity with IFN-\u03b3 (Table 1) . Type I IFNs, induced in most cell types by viruses and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), are clustered on chromosome 9 and consist of several \u03b1 genes and pseudogenes and one \u03b2 gene. In contrast, IFN-\u03b3, mainly secreted by T helper (Th)1 lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, is coded by a single gene on chromosome 12. IFNs mediate their effects by binding to cell surface receptors and thus activating members of the Janus kinase (JAK) family [22, 23] . Activated JAKs phosphorylate the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors. As shown in Figure 1 , IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor engagement leads to the activation of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway through the actions of JAK1 and tyrosine kinase (TYK)2 protein kinases (JAK1 and JAK2 for IFN-\u03b3), which catalyse phosphorylation events leading to the activation and heterodimerisation of STAT proteins, mostly including STAT1 and STAT2 (STAT1 reciprocal homodimer for IFN-\u03b3). The STAT1/2 heterocomplex translocates to the nucleus, where it associates with p48/IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-9 to form IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). ISGF3 binds to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) of cellular genes, known as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), leading to their induced expression and synthesis of the ISG products. Sequence motifs within the ISRE also serve as target sites for IRFs, whose action and ISREbinding properties contribute to define the overall spectrum and duration of ISG expression [21, 24] . Gene products regulated by IFNs are the primary effectors of the IFN-mediated biological responses. ISGs represent diverse functional groups, ranging from genes encoding immunomodulatory proteins to those encoding metabolic regulators [19, 25] . Oligonucleotide microarray studies in a fibrosarcoma (HT1080) cell line, as well as in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human dendritic cells treated with IFN, have identified > 300 induced genes [25, 26] . However, the exact pattern of induction varies depending on cell type and the type of IFN. This impressive stimulation of transcription has made it difficult to attribute the effects of IFNs to any particular gene product.",

Other transcription factors, known as dsRNA-activated factor and virus-activated factor (VAF), have been implicated in dsRNA-and virusmediated induction of ISGs [27] . They form transcriptional complexes with activated IRF3 and the co-activator CREB binding protein (CBP)/P300 (Figure 1 ). Although in virally infected cells both IFNs and viral dsRNA can contribute to the induction of ISGs, in some cases mere binding of viral envelope proteins to the cell surface receptors can trigger transcription of specific ISGs.

Some of these pathways are more specific for a particular group of viruses, although more than one pathway may control infection with a single virus. A common feature among these antiviral pathways, excluding Mx protein 1, is the requirement for dsRNA as a common activator or substrate to IFN-induced protein factors. Whereas OAS and PKR enzymes require nonspecific association with dsRNA for their activation and antiviral effects, ADAR-1 uses dsRNA as a substrate for deamination of adenosines and their conversion into inosines (see below). The existence of considerable residual effects of type I IFNs against encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) in mice lacking functional RNase L, PKR and Mx suggests the presence of additional pathways [28] .",

There are three structurally related size classes of OAS enzymes (small, medium, large) encoded by three separate, but clustered, genes [29] . Within each class, multiple isozymes with different carboxyl terminal regions are produced by splicing of the primary transcripts. These enzymes polymerise ATP into 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylates (2-5(A)) of different lengths, but all of them need to be activated by dsRNA. The 2-5(A) molecules activate the latent ribonuclease, RNase L, by inducing its dimerisation. The 2-5(A) synthetase/RNase L system mediates some of the antiviral and anticellular actions of IFNs by degradation of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). This antiviral pathway has been reported to operate against a number of viruses, including important human pathogens such as hepatitis C virus, vaccinia and HIV [30] . If RNA degradation is targeted to cellular RNA, this leads to programmed cell death (apoptosis). Programmed cell death may then prevent virus replication and spread if it occurs early enough in infection, or promote virus spread if it occurs late. An RNase L-independent action of OAS 9-2 isozyme causes apoptosis by a process that does not require its enzyme activity, but is mediated by binding to antiapoptotic proteins, such as B cell leukaemia/lymphoma (BCL)-2 and BCL-X L , thereby blocking their actions [31] .

            "text": "PKR represents an IFN-induced serine-threonine protein kinase that needs to be activated by autophosphorylation. IFN-induced PKR associates with viral dsRNA and becomes activated. However, other agents, such as heparin, can also activate it. PKR may interact with several cellular proteins, including protein activator of PKR (PACT) [32] . PACT can directly bind to PKR and activate it independently of dsRNA. Once activated, PKR may catalyse phosphorylation of a number of substrates, including the \u03b1-subunit of protein synthesis initiation factor 2 (eIF-2\u03b1), thus preventing a translation initiation factor recycling and resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis. In addition to its role in translation, PKR participates in several signalling transcription pathways. For example, PKR contributes to the induction of early genes such as c-fos and c-jun by platelet-derived growth factor and modulates transcription functions of STAT1. Other studies clearly demonstrated a role for PKR in the activation of transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB). Activation of NF-\u03baB leads to transcription induction of a number of genes, including IFN-\u03b2, perpetuating IFN synthesis and induction of parallel antiviral pathways [30] . It is clear that PKR is an important mediator of extracellular stimuli that regulate many aspects of cellular physiology, including regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Moreover, PKR might function as a tumour suppressor and its overexpression leads to apoptosis via BCL-2 and BCL-X L inhibition. Numerous viruses block PKR activation or action using a variety of biochemical strategies. Although some investigations suggest that PKR is dispensable in defence against virus infection, several experiments underline its crucial role as a mediator of IFN activity. For example, overexpression of PKR leads to inhibition of EMCV replication, and dominant-negative PKR mutant or antisense PKR cDNA suppress the anti-EMCV action of type I IFNs. Mice lacking PKR are predisposed to lethal intranasal infection by usually innocuous vesicular stomatitis virus and display increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection [33, 34] . Studies using PKR null mice have also shown that this kinase is a key component of the host early defence system that acts early in innate immunity before activation of the IFN system and acquired immune response [34] .",

The human MxA protein forms large oligomers. A mutant MxA that fails to form oligomers is devoid of GTPase activity. This mutant, however, retains antiviral activity, although it is rapidly degraded in cells [38] . Mx proteins possess intrinsic antiviral activity and do not require cooperation with any other IFN-induced cellular protein for their action. Their antiviral activity depends on GTP binding as well as protein-protein interactions with viral proteins, resulting in either disruption of viral RNA synthesis or blocking of viral nucleocapsid transport. A unique property of Mx GTPases is their antiviral activity against a wide range of RNA viruses. A mouse Mx gene has been shown to exert inhibitory effects on orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses and togaviruses [27] . No inhibition of picornavirus (Mengo and EMCV) replication was observed with the Mx pathway [27] . Another family of IFN-induced guanylatebinding proteins (GBPs) includes GBP-1 and GBP-2.

Coronaviruses, including avian infectious bronchitis virus, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus and human coronaviruses, were sensitive to IFN treatment [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . Although both types of IFNs were effective against coronavirus infection, some studies suggested that type I IFNs may be more potent than IFN-\u03b3. In one study, IFN-\u03b3 even stimulated 100-fold production of infectious virions of human coronavirus OC43 strain in human neuronal cells [49] . IFN-\u03b1 was more potent against MHV compared with IFN-\u03b3 in a mouse model. More recent work showed that IFN-\u03b1 displayed the strongest inhibitory activity among several potential anti-SARS drugs on human coronavirus 229E replicase [50] . Combined treatment with both IFNs showed synergistic antiviral effects [51] . As discussed in the previous sections, most viruses potentially induced IFN pathways, eventually leading to IFN production by infected cells. The ability to induce cellular IFN production, which may modulate virus infection, was demonstrated both for animal and human coronaviruses [47, [52] [53] [54] . It has been suggested that the enteropathogenic potential of human coronavirus OC43 (strain Paris) may be due to a lack of IFN induction [53] . Moreover, leukocytes of children with recurrent respiratory infections produced lower yields of IFN after stimulation with coronavirus compared with the control cohort [54] .",

Its specific activity against numerous viruses was higher than that exhibited by other IFN-\u03b1 agents, indicating its higher antiviral activity on a molar basis [57] . Moreover, IFN alfacon-1 induced NK cell activity more potently compared with IFN-\u03b1-2a and IFN-\u03b1-2b . In the preliminary, uncontrolled study of patients with SARS, 13 patients who received single treatment with corticosteroids were compared with 9 patients who additionally received IFN alfacon-1 (7 patients received 9.0 \u00b5g/day, 2 patients received 15.0 \u00b5g/day) [6] . Use of IFN alfacon-1 resulted in more rapid resolution of radiographic lung abnormalities and better oxygen saturation levels. Moreover, IFN alfacon-1 patients showed less increases in creatine kinase levels and a more rapid return of lactate dehydrogenase to normal levels. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels are suspected to indicate lung parenchymal damage and are associated with poor prognosis [6] . In Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. (2004) 4(6) addition, treatment with IFN alfacon-1 decreased the median time of peak lung involvement and IFN alfacon-1treated patients needed supplemental oxygen for shorter periods.

So far, this is the only report that has investigated the influence of IFNs on SCV replication in a human cell line (human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco2). All other investigations were exclusively performed in African green monkey kidney cell line Vero. Effects of recombinant IFN-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1-2b [Intron \u00ae A], Essex Pharma, Munich, Germany), IFN-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2-1b [Betaferon \u00ae ], Schering, Berlin, Germany) and IFN-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3-1b [Imukin \u00ae ], Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany) on two different virus strains (FFM-1, Hong Kong) were compared in Vero and in Caco2 cells. After pretreatment, EC 50 (concentration of the compound needed to inhibit the cytopathic effect to 50% of the control value) of IFN-\u03b2 for SCV FFM-1 in Vero cells was 50-fold and 25-fold lower than that of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, respectively. Similar results were obtained for the comparison of anti-SCV effects of IFN-\u03b1 with IFN-\u03b2 using SCV Hong Kong in Vero cells and for both strains in Caco2 cells.

By using oligonucleotide arrays with probe sets corresponding to > 6800 human genes, > 300 genes differentially regulated by IFNs were already identified [26] . PKR, which plays an essential role in replication inhibition of numerous viruses, was upregulated by IFN-\u03b2, but not by IFN-\u03b1, in the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 [26] . Moreover, most viruses developed mechanisms in order to antagonise IFN-induced antiviral effects by different mechanisms, including interference with ISGs [20] . SCV induced robust upregulation of ISGs with antiviral activity, such as MxA in human cells. This upregulation did not abolish virus replication [16] , indicating that SCV developed strategies to counteract antiviral activities of IFNs. The nature of those effects possibly influences the sensitivity of SCV to different IFNs. This might help to explain the different sensitivities of SCV to IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b1. A second in vitro study reported on the use of IFN-\u03b2-1a on SCV replication [18] . In this study, effects of IFN-\u03b2-1a on replication of three SCV isolates (Tor2, Tor7, Urbani) were investigated in Vero E6 cells because IFN-\u03b2-1a was found to have a specific activity 14 times higher than IFN-\u03b2-1b [60] . The use of IFN-\u03b2-1a required IC 50 (50% inhibitory concentration) as low as 50 IU/ml after pretreatment and 500 IU/ml after posttreatment. As IFN-\u03b2-1b was not assessed by Hensley et al. in their system, differences in anti-SCV activity of different IFN-\u03b2 preparations remained undetermined. Cinatl et al. compared different IFN-\u03b2 preparations and found that they exhibited similar effects when compared at an antiviral units basis, that is, IU/ml of a culture medium [61] . However, the higher specific activity of IFN-\u03b2-1a compared with IFN-\u03b2-1b may be favourable for the achievement of maximal doses of IFN for patients.",

Pegylation is the attachment of an inert polyethlylene glycol polymer to proteins. The absorption of pegylated molecules is slower, the half-life is longer and the rate of clearance from the plasma is lower than that of the native molecule. Therefore, pegylation of IFN increases the duration of its biological activity [65] . Pegylated IFN-\u03b1 exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on SCV replication in vitro. The results were similar to those obtained for IFN-\u03b1 by Cinatl et al. [16] .",

These transcription cofactors assemble on the PRD of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter to drive the expression and production of IFN-\u03b2. Alternatively, the PRD of IFN-\u03b2 may be activated by the transcriptional complex composed of IRF-3, DRAF-1 and CBP/p300 (not shown). B) Therapeutic application of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and secreted IFN-\u03b2 (induced by virus dsRNA or proteins) bind to the type I IFN receptor to initiate JAK-STAT signalling and the formation of ISGF3, the latter of which promotes expression of ISGs. Some ISGs also contain PRDs allowing dual responsiveness to IRF-3 complexed with DRAF-1 and transcription factor CBP/p300.
