            "text": "Wheezy lower respiratory tract illnesses (wLRIs) are common in early childhood and are often associated with respiratory viruses, particularly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 1,2 and RSV-associated wLRI represents the most common cause of hospitalization among infants in firstworld countries. 3 The relationship between early wheezing and subsequent development of asthma is controversial. On the one hand, it is clear that, although wheezing in infancy is common, these episodes are often transient in nature and are not, on a population basis, associated with asthma in later life. 4 However, numerous studies have reported associations between severe RSV bronchiolitis in early childhood and recurrent wheezing and asthma in later childhood, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] and it is unclear why such relationships occur in some children but not in the population at large. 4 The relationship between early childhood RSV infection and atopic sensitization is equally controversial, with published studies available that argue either for 5 or against 9 a causal relationship between early infections and subsequent atopy. Additionally, accumulating evidence suggests that susceptibility to viral infection and atopy may derive from a common set of transient developmental defects in cellular immune function(s) operative during early infancy, [10] [11] [12] which further complicate considerations of causal versus consequential interactions between these disease processes and how they impact on asthma development.",

Children who experienced LRI secondary to rhinovirus infection have been regarded as being at particular risk because of underlying respiratory conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, or other cardiorespiratory problems. 17, 18 More recently, Lemanske et al 19 in infancy was a significant risk factor for preschool wheezing in their population of ''high-risk'' children.",

[6] [7] [8] Most of this work has focused on the role of RSV and has used populations comprising hospitalised children or children from closed communities. Although the importance of RSV as a cause of severe respiratory infections in infancy is undisputed, few studies have looked at the long-term sequelae of LRI caused by other respiratory viruses, including rhinoviruses. A notable exception is the recent study by Lemanske et al, 19 which found the most significant risk factor for preschool wheezing was symptomatic rhinovirus illnesses in infancy. They evaluated wheezing up to 3 years of age, and it is likely that many of these children belong to the group of transient wheezers previously described, with less than half of them likely to have persistence of wheeze or asthma in later life. 4 Children hospitalized with rhinovirus-associated wLRI have also been reported to have an increased risk of asthma at 6 years of age. 24 The latter study also reported that children with atopic dermatitis were more likely to wheeze during rhinovirus infections, which raised the possibility that these children may have been more likely to wheeze at the time of infection because of underlying atopic changes preexisting in the airways. In the current study, we also found significant associations between rhinovirus-associated wLRI in the first year of life and current asthma, current wheeze at 5 years, and persistent wheeze, which confirms the importance of considering viruses other than RSV when determining the viral contribution to the development of persistent asthma in childhood.",

Factors related to immune maturation seem to be particularly relevant in this context. Notably, recent evidence suggests that resistance to viral infection and atopic sensitization is dependent on an overlapping series of immune mechanisms that are strongly developmentally regulated and as a consequence are attenuated in early life, in particular among children at high atopic risk. 26 Moreover, viral infections, in general, 25 and RSV infection, in particular, 26, 27 have been hypothesized to be capable of modulating the functions of these immune mechanisms during postnatal maturation. Thus, the degree to which atopic risk determines susceptibility to viral infection versus viral infection driving sensitization, and more importantly how these apparently overlapping processes interact in the context of asthma development in early life, is yet to be resolved.",

Previous cohort studies that have provided the strongest statistical support for a causative role for the cumulative (potentially synergistic) effects of infection-induced and atopy-induced airways inflammation in the etiology of persistent asthma in childhood 20, 25, 28 have suffered from the limitation of lack of information on the timing of atopic sensitization among respective study groups. In both cases, these studies have relied on assessment of atopy status at outcome age (5 or 6 years), which is several years beyond the peak period of respiratory viral infections during infancy. This begs the question of whether genetic predisposition to atopy per se creates susceptibility to the asthma-promoting effects of viral infection (for example, such subjects may intrinsically develop excessively T H 2-polarized host antiviral responses that are inefficient in viral elimination), or whether active expression of the atopic phenotype during infancy via sensitization to environmental allergen(s) is required. In contrast to the previous studies, in the current cohort we could assess SPT reactivity employing standard criteria [28] [29] [30] to a broad panel of allergens at 6 months and 24 months en route to the final assessment at outcome age 5 years. As demonstrated in Table III , stratification of our study population on the basis of time of initial expression of atopy reveals that the association between viral infections during infancy and subsequent development of persistent wheeze and current asthma at 5 years is restricted to the subset of high-risk children manifesting sensitization during the first 2 years of life. Moreover, this association is also restricted to infections that spread to the lower respiratory tract and are of sufficient intensity to trigger severe symptoms in the infants.",

First, and in line with the bulk of currently prevailing opinion in this field, early atopic sensitization and severe LRI in infancy could both be indirect markers of a wheezy (viz. asthmatic) phenotype per se, without playing direct causal roles. Arguing against this opinion and in favor of a direct causal relationship, (1) the effects of early wLRI and early sensitization are at least additive in relation to risk for subsequent asthma (Table III; see references 6, 25, 26 ); (2) wLRI was not associated with transient wheeze (Table II) ; and (3) febrile nonwheezy LRI show the same association with subsequent asthma as wLRI (Table III) , which suggests that infection intensity during infancy is the key factor determining the level of risk associated with individual infections as opposed to whether they trigger wheeze at the time. Accordingly, we suggest as an alternative interpretation that these findings are consistent with a model we have recently proposed for asthma etiology in early life. 25, 29 In this model, the contemporaneous occurrence of cycles of viral-induced and allergen-induced inflammation in the airways during the period of rapid lung growth and remodeling in infancy interacts synergistically to disrupt underlying tissue differentiation programs. This interaction results in deleterious changes in ensuing respiratory functions, which may then manifest as persistent wheeze and/or asthma.",

These findings collectively suggest that development of more effective strategies to shield the growing airways of susceptible subjects against inflammation during a critical window period during infancy may be a valid approach for longterm asthma prevention. Moreover, given the possibility that the viral and atopy-associated inflammation may interact synergistically to drive asthma pathogenesis, 25,28 effective attenuation of either of these pathways in infants may be sufficient to achieve significant long-term clinical benefits. In this context, it is pertinent to note the recent publication 30 indicating that 1 year of treatment of 2to-3-year-old children at high risk of asthma with inhaled corticosteroids ameliorated symptoms during treatment, but this effect was lost after withdrawal of treatment, which argues against any disease-modifying effects of early treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. However, the current findings suggest that alternative strategies using a broader range of treatment protocols, including different classes of anti-inflammatory drugs or immunomodulatory therapies, may be required to further assess if early intervention can result in disease modification.",
