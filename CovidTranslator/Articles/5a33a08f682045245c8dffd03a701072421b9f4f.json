Final lots of purified virus containing <0.02% of the crude tissue culture proteins had absorption maxima at 256 nm and minima at 241.2 nm and a mean extinction coefficient of E : $ = 54.3 at 256 nm. The fully corrected sedimentation coefficient for the intact virion wasS&, h = 381 S.

Virus concentration extrapolated to infinite dilution resulted in a fully corrected sedimentation coefficient, S&, W = 381 S. Equilibrium runs with 2293 were of limited meaning due to the rapid disintegration of the virus at 20\". PAGE Acrylamide gels were electrophoresed both in discontinuous Tris buffer and in continuous phosphate buffer systems. The electropherograms of stained gels were remarkably similar for the different systems, despite efforts to separate possible overlapping bands by varying gel length and other conditions of electrophoresis. Gels stained for protein, phosphoprotein, glycoprotein, and lipoprotein consistently revealed seven polypeptides: six contained carbohydrate, one contained lipid, but none contained phosphate at a level exceeding 0.6% of the virion by weight (Fig.  4) . These polypeptides ranged in estimated molecular weight from the smallest glycoprotein, 16,900 daltons and comprising 17% of the viral protein, to the lipoglycoprotein, 196,000 daltons and 15% of the viral protein (Table 1) . Two glycoproteins were associated with the surface projections and could be entirely removed from the virion by bromelin: band 3 of 105,500 daltons and band 7 of 16,900 daltons. Together they constituted 25% of the viral protein and a significant part of the virion weight; the density of intact virus in sucrose and in potassium tartrate was 1.18 and of bromelin-treated virus was 1.15 g/ml.",

Growth characteristics of 2293 are quite distinct from those of most respiratory viruses. The virus produces at least 2.5 logs more infectious progeny when cultured under a fortified medium containing twice the normal concentrations of amino acids and vitamins than when cultured under unfortified media. Preliminary amino acid analyses on purified virus show that 2293 contains five amino acids in concentrations of >8 mol%: aspartic acid, glutamic acid, leucine, serine, and valine. Possibly it is the additional requirement for one or more of these amino acids which results in increased virus yield in fortified cultures.",

The titer drop is concomitant with an increase in CPE, so that the commonly practiced time of harvesting respiratory virus cultures at early 4+ CPE (3-7 days) results in a low-yield passage of 2293. Plaque titers of 2293 are 1.2-1.6 logs higher than tube infectivity titers; both titration systems give 26-hr titers of 10g~2-10g~6 TCID,,Jml or 1010.4-1010.g PFU/ml. 2293 is a relatively poor test antigen and a weak immunogen. The IHA and CF antigen titers are considerably lower than one would expect from nine logs of virus, and the IHA, CF, and SN titers (1:80, 1:128, 1:40, respectively) of antiserum to purified virions also are much lower than expected. Although Bradburne (1970) reported two precipitin lines in ID tests between 2293 and human 229E-convalescent sera, we consistently found only one line in both ID and IE tests with convalescent human sera and rabbit antiserum versus lo-logarithm preparations of crude or purified virus.",

The fact that 2293 could be adsorbed onto human \"0\" erythrocytes at 0\" and then eluted at 37\" as the first step in purification scheme (1) was surprising because, unlike OC-43, 2293 does not agglutinate these cells. At the same time, OC-43 hemagglutinates by an \"adhering\" phenomenon (Kaye and Dowdle, 19691, and this 163 FIG. 4 . Spectrophotometric scans of 2293 viral proteins separated on discontinuous acrylamide gels and stained for lipoprotein (A), glycoprotein (B), phosphoprotein (C), and protein (Dl. Gels were electrophoresed in a Tris buffer system with a 3% stacking gel at pH 6.8, an 8% resolving gel at pH 8.8, and an electrode buffer at pH 8.3, at 38 V, 1.5 mA/gel, for 1.2 hr for stacking, and 99 V, 3.0 mAige1, for 1 hr for resolving. appears to be the manner by which 2293 is adsorbed onto human erythrocytes. Purified 2293 has seven polypeptides, the largest of which is a lipoglycopolypeptide and five others of which are glycopolypeptides. No phosphoproteins were detected by the staining procedure used, which in our hands could detect a band with as little as 0.12 pg phosphate. Spike proteins 3 and 7, both glycoproteins, were fully removed by bromelin in the same time and under the same conditions required for OC-43 (Hierholzer et al., 1972) .",
