Sudden death thus is an unexpected fatal event that very often is unwitnessed. Many of these deaths occur during sleep or at an unknown time. There is no consensus on the exact duration between the onset of symptoms and death for an unexpected fatal event to be considered sudden in nature. The most acceptable definition of sudden death is given by the World Health Organization, which defines sudden death as any death occurring within 24 h from the onset of symptoms (Saukko and Knight, 2004) . Cardiovascular system disorders are reported as the leading causes of sudden deaths. Despite advances in medicine regarding the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, a large number of sudden and unexpected deaths are caused by infections. Sudden deaths resulting from infectious diseases remain a cause of concern, especially in the developing countries (Mittal et al., 2014) .",

Infections/infectious diseases are thus caused by the invasion and multiplication of various pathogenic macro-and microorganisms in host tissues. The process usually involves an agent, reservoir, port of exit, mode of transmission, port of entry, and host. These infectious agents include: bacteria, viruses, viroids, and prions, rickettsiae, mycoplasmas, fungi, protozoa, helminths, etc. Various etiological agents and a few common infections caused by them are listed in Table 1 . Bacterial and viral infections remain the most common causes of sudden death from infectious diseases.

The infectious diseases which are commonly associated with increased morbidity and mortality are human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), pneumonia, tuberculosis, and myocarditis. Death from infectious diseases may occur as a direct consequence of the infection or from complications in an immunosuppressed host. Sudden deaths from infectious diseases are mostly reported in the acute phases of infection, and are due to secondary infections in an immunocompromised host. For example, in adult HIV infections, sudden death may result from infective causes due to opportunistic infections. Untreated/undiagnosed infectious diseases of a chronic nature also form a major portion of reported sudden deaths, especially in developing countries. Sudden death due to infectious Creutzfeld-Jacob disease disease may be categorized based on the organ system involvement. The common infectious causes of sudden death based on organ system involvement are listed in Table 2 . Though no organ system is spared by infectious agents, the majority of sudden deaths from infectious causes are due to cardiovascular system and respiratory system involvement. In the pediatric population infections of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system account for the majority of cases of sudden death. Sudden deaths resulting from infectious causes involving the cardiovascular system are commonly due to myocarditis and infective endocarditis. Myocarditis is a major cause of sudden unexpected death in young adults. Infectious causes of myocarditis include bacteria, viruses, and helminths (Magnani, 2006) . Infective endocarditis, however, is mostly of bacterial origin. Sudden deaths involving the respiratory system are mostly due to bacterial infections causing pneumonia and tuberculosis. Sudden death due to viral involvement of the respiratory system may be due to fulminant viral pneumonitis or bacterial pneumonia complicating an initial viral pneumonitis. Similarly the common causes of sudden death from central nervous system involvement are meningitis and encephalitis, which can be bacterial, viral, or fungal in origin.",

Bartonella-induced silent myocarditis has also been described as a cause of sudden unexpected cardiac death. In infections from Borrelia burgdorferi, cardiac involvement occurs in 1-8% of the cases and death is attributed to conduction disturbances. Wesslen et al. (2001) suggested that Bartonella-induced silent subacute myocarditis may eventually lead to electric instability and sudden unexpected cardiac deaths. Granulomatous myocarditis is another rare disease of the heart that is reported in tuberculosis , syphilis, tularemia, brucellosis, and fungal infections. The mechanism of death includes arrhythmias, cardiac rupture, coronary occlusion, obstruction to pulmonary blood flow leading to fatal hemorrhage, and impaired myocardial contractility. Characteristic granulomatous lesions in infectious diseases of the myocardium are shown in Table 3 . Chlamydial infection has also been associated with endocarditis, myocarditis, and pericarditis (Odeh and Oliven, 1992) . Chlamydia pneumoniae is considered an unusual cause of myocarditis and sudden unexpected death. In infective endocarditis, the most common sites of infection are the aortic and mitral valves, except in the intravenous drug abusers, where the right-sided valves are primarily affected. Sudden death in infective endocarditis occurs due to perforation of a free wall myocardial abscess or rupture of a valve leaflet. Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for 10-20% of these cases and is the major cause of death in intravenous drug abusers. Other bacterial causes include Hemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella (HACEK group). Tertiary syphilis causing aortitis may cause sudden death from rupture of aortic aneurysms with aortic dissection. The mechanism of death is either blood loss with hypovolemic shock or a fatal cardiac tamponade from intrapericardial rupture.",

The most common target organs in miliary tuberculosis are the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Corynebacterium diphtheriae produces a gray pseudomembrane in the pharynx and larynx, which may lead to respiratory obstruction and sudden death. Sudden death from acute epiglottitis occurs from respiratory obstruction caused by swelling of the epiglottic folds, uvula, and vocal cords.

Sudden deaths can result from splenic rupture in typhoid. Primary peritonitis may occur postsplenectomy, and in patients with splenic hypoplasia.

Malaria is caused by a protozoal parasite belonging to the genus Plasmodium and is transmitted by the female anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria is broadly classified as falciparum and non-falciparum. Death is rare with non-falciparum malaria; however, the mortality approaches 10-20% in patients with complicated falciparum malaria. It may be the cause of sudden death in nonimmune and susceptible individuals such as immigrants, tourists, business travelers, and sailors. Malaria is also a cause of disease and death among children under 5 years and pregnant women. Cerebral malaria (Alunni-Perret et al., 2010), acute renal insufficiency, acute pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome are possible mechanisms of sudden death due to malaria . Sudden death in malaria may also be due to rupture of an enlarged spleen, which is fragile in malaria and more vulnerable to rupture. Amebiasis is another cause of death from parasitic infections, which is caused by the protozoan Entameba histolytica. Entameba histolytica infection primarily causes amebic dysentery or amebic liver abscess. Sudden death may follow the rupture of an amebic liver abscess. Untreated liver abscesses can extend into the neighboring organs including lung ( Figure 4 ) and heart. Fatal cardiac tamponade may occur with intrapericardial rupture of an amebic liver abscess.",

Focal aggregates of lymphocytes not associated with necrosis may, however, be seen in elderly patients and are not diagnostic of myocarditis. The Dallas criteria of histopathological categorization were proposed for the diagnosis of myocarditis. As per this criteria, an inflammatory infiltrate and associated myocyte necrosis or damage not characteristic of an ischemic event is diagnostic of myocarditis. However, its diagnostic utility is questioned due to sampling errors, and variation in expert interpretation, etc. (Baughman, 2006) . Myocardial involvement may be patchy. It is recommended that at least 5-10 sections be taken from various areas of the myocardium for adequate histological sampling in the diagnosis of mild forms of myocarditis (Kitulwatte et al., 2010) . Microscopic findings in viral pneumonitis are usually nonspecific and include edema and widening of the intra-alveolar septa with a mononuclear cell infiltrate. In some cases, diagnostic viral inclusions may be demonstrated. In SARS, postmortem histopathological evaluations of lung tissue show diffuse alveolar damage consistent with the pathological manifestations of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

An aseptic technique should be used to collect the sample, which should be stored and transported in the correct medium and at the right temperature. Close liaison with the microbiology and virology laboratories is important to guide the collection, preservation, transport, and evaluation of specimens. This is particularly important in cases where there are positive cultures with negative histological findings.

            "text": "Infectious agents are not an uncommon cause of sudden death. A thorough medicolegal investigation is warranted in these deaths, which should include a complete and detailed autopsy examination. In cases with nonspecific morphological changes, investigation of appropriate autopsy samples by recently developed laboratory techniques may prove invaluable and shed light on the cause of death. Although the role of histology in cases of sudden death has been highlighted, histological evaluation is not very commonly done in many areas, especially in developing countries; its significance, therefore, needs to be emphasized along with the use of microbiology and molecular diagnostic methods. Genetic engineering has led to the development of highly infectious and virulent strains of microorganisms. Forensic pathologists should be aware of the importance of infectious causes of sudden death in the present era of bioterrorism and emergent and reemerging diseases.",
