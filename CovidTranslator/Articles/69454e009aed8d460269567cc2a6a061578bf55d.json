The spectrum of this disease ranges from mild to life-threatening. Some cases might progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or multiple organ function failure. The epidemiological survey has indicated that the general population is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Respiratory droplets and contact are considered as the main routes of transmission. The COVID-19 patients currently remain as the main source of infection. Asymptomatic carriers and those in the incubation period may also be infectious (General Office of National Health Commission, 2020; Rothe C et al., 2020; Special Expert Group for Control of the Epidemic of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia of the Chinese Preventive Medicine Association, 2020; Yu P et al., 2020). Recognition, quarantine and treatment of the confirmed patients is critically important. People with positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA of respiratory tract specimen are probably infectious source of COVID-19. According to the guideline in China, patients should be isolated until two consecutive SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests of respiratory tract specimens are both negative, with the interval of at least 24 hours (General Office of National Health Commission, 2020).",
