Some of the biochemical properties of MHV3 have been determined (10, 11) , although little is known about the molecular events during replication. (7) . This is undoubtedly clue to difficulty in growing MHV3 in cell cultures, although the growth of MHV 3 in some cells has been described (6, 7, 10) .

Furthermore the virus yield reached 106 PFU/ml even in the presence of 5---10 ~zg/ml of actinomycin D which within two hours inhibited cellular RNA synthesis by over 98 per cent. The optimal temperature of virus production was found to be 35 \u00b0 C, although MHV3 seemed to grow well within the range of 330--37 \u00b0 C.

Thus, MHV3 grown in DBT cells seemed to contain particles of different densities; high density (HD; 1.25--1.31 g/cm3), intermediate density (ID; 1.18--1.20 g/cm3), and low density (LD; 1.10--i. 14 g/ era3). The LD and ID particles appear to be made from membrane-bound MHV3 and complete MHV3 particles, respectively, because a substantial amount of infectivity was deteeted in them and the densities of LD and ID particles were comparable to those of membrane-bound human coronavirus (IteV)/0C43 (3) and of intact coronavirus (3, 4, 7) . The HD group was composed of unusual virus particles which were infectious but more dense than is usual with coronaviruses. It has been reported that HCV/229 E particles are easily deprived of their petallike projections (4) , and that treatment with NP40 increases the density of the virus particles from 1.19 to 1.27 g/em a (4). We therefore postulate that the HD group might be composed of incomplete virions which had been damaged during centrifugation. However the reason why the HD group retained infectivity remains unknown.",
