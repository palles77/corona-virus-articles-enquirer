In this study, we investigated Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) proliferation when the function of the Golgi was disturbed. Golgi function was disturbed using chemical inhibitors, namely, brefeldin A (BFA) and golgicide A (GCA), and RNA interfering targets, such as the Golgi-specific BFA-resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) and Rab2 GTPases. CSFV proliferation was significantly inhibited during RNA replication and viral particle generation after BFA and GCA treatment. CSFV multiplication dynamics were retarded in cells transfected with GBF1 and Rab2 shRNA. Furthermore, CSFV proliferation was promoted by GBF1 and Rab2 overexpression using a lentiviral system. Hence, Golgi function is important for CSFV multiplication, and GBF1 and Rab2 participate in CSFV proliferation. Further studies must investigate Golgi-resident proteins to elucidate the mechanism underlying CSFV replication.",

Specifically, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus as well as their resident proteins are used by many viruses to complete one or more stages in their life cycle (Ravindran et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016) . Anterograde and retrograde trafficking of cargo proteins between the ER and Golgi are mediated by the cytosolic coat protein complex II (COP II) and COP I transport systems, respectively. These systems are regulated by viruses to facilitate their multiplication (Rust et al. 2001; Richards et al. 2002; Yamayoshi et al. 2008) . Viruses also regulate two important targets, i.e. Golgi-specific BFA-resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) and Rab2 GTPases, which are primarily involved in Golgi-to-ER retrograde trafficking (Raj 1961; Wessels et al. 2006) .",

ST cells were transfected with the interference vector when cell confluence reached 70-90%. The transfection operation followed the protocol for the jetPRIME transfection reagent (Polyplustransfection, Illkirch, France). At 48 h post-transfection, 5 \u03bcg/mL puromycin was added to continuously screen positive cells for about 20 days. Scrambled shRNA was constructed and transfected using the same methods.

The reaction was performed with SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa) using the Bio-Rad iQ5 system under the following conditions: pre-degeneration at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of degeneration at 95\u00b0C for 10 s, and annealing and extension at 60\u00b0C for 30 s.

The proliferation of viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Goueslain et al. 2010) and dengue virus (Carpp et al. 2014) , is sensitive to BFA treatment owing to the inhibitory effect of BFA on GBF1 and the consequent inhibition of COP I vesicle formation. However, three BFA-sensitive large Arf-GEFs (GBF1, BIG1 and BIG2) are present in mammalian cells . Therefore, GCA and RNA interference were used for further tests. GCA is a highly specific inhibitor of GBF1 and had the same inhibitory effect on CSFV proliferation as BFA. Furthermore, CSFV replication in GBF1 shRNA-transfected cells was significantly inhibited compared with that in GBF1-undisturbed cells.

In the present study, CSFV replication was suppressed when Rab2 was downregulated. The overexpression of Rab2 can accelerate CSFV proliferation. The mechanisms by which Rab2 influences CSFV proliferation must be further investigated.",

Additionally, the secretory pathways involved in the Golgi apparatus are always utilized by viruses for egress on infected cells. Transport from early endosomes to the trans-Golgi network is important for vaccinia virus membrane wrapping and egress (Sivan et al. 2016) . Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) can egress via the exosomal release pathway by budding at trans-Golgi network vacuoles and inducing multivesicular body formation (Mori et al. 2008) . Furthermore, the hepatitis E virus and HCV also utilize the exosome release pathway for egress (Tamai et al. 2011; Nagashima et al. 2014 ). However, viral egress is a complicated process that involves many pathways and related proteins. Reports have shown that HCV can be released from Huh7 cells via a trans-Golgi network-to-endosome pathway (Jamel et al. 2016) . Additionally, HCV particles are found in endosomal compartments and released via a non-canonical secretory route that is unrelated to the Golgi-associated secretory route and may be an undescribed cellular secretion route (Bayer et al. 2016) . Viral egress has a close connection with the virus particle formation process. CSFV is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus that has no cytopathic effect in infected cells. The CSFV assembly process is still unclear and mysterious because its core protein is dispensable for CSFV assembly (Riedel et al. 2012) . Additional experiments are urgently needed to determine the mechanisms of CSFV assembly and egress.",
