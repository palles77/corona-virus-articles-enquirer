The case definition for SARS, however, likely does not represent the entire spectrum of disease caused by SARS cornoavirus (SARS-CoV). Previous studies have documented that asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV can occur; for example, asymptomatic health care workers who cared for patients with SARS developed antibodies to SARS-CoV [3, 4] . Minimally symptomatic patients with epidemiologic risks, fevers, and antibodies to SARS-CoV, but no pulmonary symptoms or infiltrates on chest x-ray have also been reported [5] .",

            "text": "There is much historical precedent for diagnostic serologies evolving from ELISA to western blot to improve sensitivity and/or specificity. The diagnosis of Lyme disease was first made by the presence of arthritis following the characteristic erythema migrans. With the recognition that erythema migrans may not be universally present, the ELISA was developed to confirm the diagnosis. However, the ELISA occasionally had false positives due to the presence of underlying diseases such as syphilis or relapsing fevers [7] . The western blot was developed to increase the specificity of using serology for the diagnosis of Lyme disease [8, 9] . These studies validated the western blot by comparing it to a population with a typical history and the presence of erythema migrans (once considered the pathognomonic clinical marker for Lyme disease). It has subsequently been shown in small case series that cellulites, urticaria, and other dermatologic eruptions can be misdiagnosed as erythema migrans [10] . In addition, erythema migrans can be caused by infection with other Borrelia species that do not cause Lyme disease [11] . Although the western blot was validated against a population with symptoms of Lyme disease and erythema migrans, its sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing infection with Borrelia burgdorferi or Lyme disease without erythema multiforme are more difficult to define. Yet the western blot is considered to be the standard confirmatory serological test for Lyme (though the diagnosis can still be made by clinical presentation alone).",

The follow-up article in this issue by Wang et al. demonstrates the detection of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against SARS-CoV. Even though this technique has been increasingly used in pathogenesis and vaccine response studies, there is little experience with its application as a diagnostic test. The CTL response defines a specific CD8 + T cell effector function. It is a very complicated assay system with undefined sensitivity and specificity, so it is unclear if this test could become a reference standard. Alternatively, these newer tests may find utility in the prognostication of the infection, though at this juncture this is only supposition.",
