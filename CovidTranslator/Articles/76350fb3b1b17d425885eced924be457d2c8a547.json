Although we are still waiting for the first detailed structure of a pseudoknot, their role in processes such as translational autoregulation or ribosomal frameshifting has been extensively studied and is now well established. Pseudoknot structures appear to play a pivotal role in small subunit ribosomal RNA and in the noncoding regions of viral RNAs. There are also strong indications that RNA pseudoknots are highly suitable structural motifs for the recognition and binding of proteins.",

Although a number of different types of tertiary interactions can shape the final three-dimensional (3D) structure, it was only during the last decade that Watson-Crick basepairing was realized to play a role at the level of tertiary structure formation. This involves base-pairing between a loop region in an orthodox secondary structure and a complementary sequence outside that loop. This type of basepairing leads to what is called a pseudoknot structure. It is now clear that in many cases the function of an RNA molecule can only be understood in terms of such pseudoknot formation.",

Fig. 1 illustrates the four basic elements of a pseudoknot of this type, showing the relative orientation of stems 1 and 2 ($1, S2) and the connecting loops 1 and 2 (L1, L2). In the case where both stem regions are contiguous, a stacking of the two helices becomes possible (as shown in Fig. 1 ). In principle, each of the two loops may consist of hundreds of nucleotides, possessing their own secondary structure. There is some debate, however, as to whether pseudoknots formed by long-range basepairing interactions, including stems formed by loop-loop interactions, should be called tertiary interactions, and whether the term pseudoknot should be restricted to the simpler case illustrated in Fig. 1 .

(For recent reviews on RNA pseudoknots, covering the period before 1993, see [1, 2, 4] .) of triple interactions between L1 or L2 with the stems S2 and Sl, respectively, remains an open question.

The first, small circle is derived from part of the 5' exon and the second, large one comprises the intron. The results could be explained by the formation of a pseudoknot structure involving the internal guide sequence (IGS).",

This problem received a new twist with the observation by Haenni and coworkers [11] that a 3' terminal fragment of TYMV RNA of as few as 38 nucleotides, harbouring just one pseudoknot, is sufficient for specific initiation of minus-strand synthesis.

As such, they mimic the function of the polyA tail in cellular mRNAs. In a very extensive nmtagenesis analysis, Gallie and coworkers [14\" ] have pinpointed which part of the 72 base stalk, or upstream pseudoknot domain (UPD), mediates this regulation; it turned out that both the higher order structure of PK 2 and PK 3 and their conserved sequences, especially in the 3' proximal PK3, are essential for translation. Using band shift analysis they also demonstrated that this upstream pseudoknot domain is specifically recognised by proteins from wheat germ or carrot extracts. These proteins also recognise the 5' leader, thereby parallellingo the properties of polyA-binding proteins. ",

The proposal has, to my knowledge, the unique feature that a stretch from the coding sequence is needed for pseudoknot formation. In the second model, proposed by Pilipenko et al. [20] , the pseudoknot-forn~ng basepairing takes place with the loop of the downstream-located hairpin (Fig. 3b ). An attempt was made to fold the 3' UTR in a tRNA-like structure, including an equivalent of the T-and D-loop interaction of tRNA.

Powers and Noller [22] obtained evidence for a possible essential function of the pseudoknot involving the 530-1oop (pseudoknot III). A similar in vivo study was performed by Brink et al.

From an elegant set of experiments, these authors concluded that mutations disrupting or weakening this tertiary interaction affected the formation of the 70S ribosomal complex. Similar results were obtained by Dan~rnel and Noller [24] who studied a C to U substitution at position 23 in the 5' terminal pseudoknot helix. This mutant, which is cold-sensitive and impaired in assembly, also leads to accumulation of free 30S subunits in the cell.

            "text": "It has become clear that pseudoknots are an important structural motif in RNA folding, and that they are essential for the biological activity of many RNA molecules. These pseudoknot interactions are usually detected in a way that is basically no different from establishing any other double-stranded region in RNA --that is, by means of techniques such as sequence comparisons, chemical modification and enzymatic digestion, computer prediction and site-directed nmtagenesis. In fact, one needs a minimum of two basepaired regions in order to describe a pseudoknot structure. Many new pseudoknots have been proposed on the basis of these techniques and it is safe to predict that the list of proposed and proven pseudoknot structures will keep growing in the near future. On the other hand, with RNA pseudoknots being both popular and fashionable at the current time [21] , some authors sometimes seem to forget that pseudoknot structures also need some experimental verification or support from sequence comparisons, especially when potential interactions of three basepairs or less are involved. Generally speaking, pseudoknots may serve to bring together RNA regions that are far apart in the sequence, so that a compact and biologically active RNA molecule is formed. In this way, RNA pseudoknots may be compared somewhat with S-S bridges in proteins (see [4] for a more elaborate discussion).",

First of all, it is essential that the structure of one or more pseudoknots of the simple type ( Fig. 1) is determined at atomic level, because certain mechanisms and processes seem to be directly related to, or dependent on, the proper folding of this motif. Good examples are the pseudoknot-dependent frameshifting in many viral RNAs, the binding of gene 32 protein to the pseudoknot in its own messenger RNA, or the regulation of translation by the three consecutive pseudoknots in the 3' UTR of tobacco mosaic virus RNA.",

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to determine which structural features are responsible for this specific recognition. The observations of Gold and coworkers [30] are highly relevant in this respect. Using their SELEX method for selecting RNAs that bind with a high affinity to a certain protein, they often find that the 'winning' ligands are pseudoknots. This was first discov-4red for the HIV reverse transcriptase [44\" ], while a second example was provided when the nerve growth factor (NGF) was tested [45] . Both pseudoknot structures were of the type illustrated in Fig. 1 , except that an extra hairpin is present in the L2 loop in the case of NGF. These findings suggest that pseudoknot struc-tures are very well equipped for binding to proteins. It is obvious that elucidation of the detailed structure of a pseudoknot-protein complex is highly desirable.",
