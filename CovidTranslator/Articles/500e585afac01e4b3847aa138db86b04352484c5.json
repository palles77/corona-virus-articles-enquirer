CLD granules have been used for the treatment of inflammatory conditions and feverish diseases in China, including seasonal influenza, but few evidence-based medicine (EBM) clinical studies have been conducted to assess its efficacy and safety in the treatment of influenza. Here, we performed an EBM clinical trial combining Western Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) evaluation systems to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CLD granules in the treatment of seasonal influenza. Methods and analysis The study is designed as a multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, doublesimulation, oseltamivir-controlled and placebo-controlled, parallel-design clinical trial. Eligible subjects (n=318) will be allocated after satisfying the criteria (Western medicine). Subjects will be randomised to receive CLD granules, oseltamivir, or a placebo for 5 days of treatment and with follow-up after treatment to record symptoms and signs and to collect pharyngeal/throat swabs and serum samples for detecting the virus and antibodies. At the same time, the syndrome differentiation criteria of TCM, such as tongue body, furred tongue and type of pulse, will be recorded as determined by doctors of both Western and Chinese medicine. Participants will be instructed to comply with the protocol and to keep a daily record of symptoms. The primary and secondary outcomes and safety indicators will be used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CLD granules in the treatment of seasonal influenza based on both Western Chinese medicine and TCM evaluation systems. Ethics and dissemination The CLD granules clinical trial will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice and has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. All participants must provide written informed consent. The results obtained will be disseminated at international medical conferences and in peer-reviewed publications. trial registration number NCT02662426; Pre-results.",

Therefore, amantadine is not recommended routinely for the prevention and treatment of influenza. NA inhibitors, the main choice for the clinical treatment of influenza virus infections, can specifically suppress both influenza viruses A and B, but because of intensive use, viral strains resistant towards NA inhibitors have also been found (including the pandemic H1N1 virus). NA inhibitors also have potential side effects on the nervous system. 9 Compared with Western medicine, Chinese herbal medicines, widely used in Chinese clinics, can regulate multiple targets for treatment and can improve the immune function, which is an advantage in relieving upper respiratory tract symptoms. 10 Considering the pandemic H1N1 virus and other viruses that may occur in the future, investigating the potential use of Chinese herbal medicines for the prevention and treatment of influenza is of great research value.",

            "text": "In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), influenza is said to resemble 'Feng Wen' (Wind-heat), a type of 'Wen-bing' meaning feverish diseases. Practitioners of Chinese medicine believed that the occurrence of 'Feng Wen' (Wind-heat) was associated with a seasonal climate, which closely resembles influenza. 11 Respiratory ailments and diseases were so prevalent in ancient China that Wen Bing developed into a highly specialised branch of TCM, which can be traced back 500 years. Abnormal climate change facilitates epidemics of respiratory diseases. Meanwhile, the human body has failed to adapt, leading to brain centre adjust disorder and decreased disease resistance, and thus increased susceptibility to viral invasion, causing the prevalence of respiratory diseases. According to the traditional Wen Bing precepts, the progression of influenza-like diseases can be divided into four stages: (1) fever development; (2) nasal symptoms; (3) fever and chills; and (4) haemoptysis. 12 In modern medicine, the first two of these stages may be viewed as symptoms that usually subside without treatment. The later stages represent unusual conditions, when bronchitis and late-onset pneumonia occur. 13 Excessive fever is regarded as a kind of toxin, and TCM and China herbal medicines for clearing away heat and toxic materials are recommended to be used, such as Ban-Lan-Gen, Jin-Yin-Hua and Yu-Xing-Cao. 14 One herbal medicine for clearing away heat and toxic materials, Chou-Ling-Dan (CLD; Laggera pterodonta) of the family Laggera Sch-Bip ex Hochst, widely cultivated in Yunnan province in China, has been approved and listed in 'Yunnan Chinese herbal medicine' 15 , 'Kunming common folk herbal medicine' 16 and 'Yunnan Material Medical' 17 for antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and clearing heat-toxicity effects. The root, or the whole plant, has been widely used to treat colds, sore throat, bronchitis, malaria and other diseases. 18 According to a previous study by our research group, CLD was effective against influenza in vivo and in vitro. Many active fractions have been isolated from L. pterodonta, including Fr 14, pterodontic acid, which had a wide spectrum of anti-influenza virus activity. The sesquiterpenoids of L. pterodonta also prevented an increase in cytokine and chemokine expression. [19] [20] [21] L. pterodonta may be used to develop an innovative antiviral drug, and further studies should be performed to investigate the mechanism of action in detail.",

Additionally, good efficacy and safety and the quick relief of fever, sore throat and other symptoms, without adverse reactions, has been shown in the treatment of children with influenza A (H1N1). 22 However, it is lacking the evidence-based medicine (EBM) clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CLD granules in the treatment of seasonal influenza. In additional, previous clinical studies have focused on Western medical methods to evaluate the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicines, which is not suit, because of a lack of a mature TCM evaluation system.

It is indicated in the CLD granules instructions that it can be used for children younger than 14 years or older than 65 years. The CLD granules have been approved as OTC drugs for many years in children under the guidance of doctors, and no serious adverse reactions were reported. And many of clinical trials of CLD on children and oseltamivir treatment for influenza in children had been reported. 38 39 We consider to set the age range as 14-65 years, which is based on following aspects: older people have a variety of accompanying diseases that increase the difficulty and risk of testing. Besides, issue of patient compliance should be considered since the subjects of this study are outpatients. Their age should not be too young or too old, otherwise it would be hard to follow-up and drop out easily. Moreover, children over the age of 14 years are basically enrolled in secondary schools and can communicate well with doctors. And in Chinese law, the age of 14 years is also the boundary between children and adolescents. Ideally, we hope to conduct this study among all age groups. However, after considering the limitations, we narrowed down the age range to 14-65 years.",
