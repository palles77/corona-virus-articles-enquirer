A recent epizootiological survey indicated that endemic foci of TBEV have been maintained in the southern part of Hokkaido until recently. In this study, we sought to isolate TBEV from wild rodents in the area. One virus, designated Oshima 08-As, was isolated from an Apodemus speciosus captured in Hokuto in 2008. Oshima 08-As was classified as the Far Eastern subtype of TBEV and formed a cluster with the other strains isolated in Hokkaido from 1995 to 1996. Thirty-six nucleotide differences resulted in 12 amino acid changes between Oshima 08-As and Oshima 5-10 isolated in 1995. Oshima 08-As caused high mortality and morbidity in a mouse model compared with Oshima 5-10. Although similar transient viral multiplication in the spleen was observed in the mice infected with Oshima 08-As and Oshima 5-10, greater viral multiplication with an inflammatory response was noted in the brains of mice infected with Oshima 08-As than those infected with Oshima 5-10. These data indicate that a few naturally occurring mutations affect the pathogenicity of the Oshima strains endemic in the southern part of Hokkaido.",

            "text": "T ick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the genus Flavivirus within the family Flaviviridae, causes tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in humans. Although most of the cases are asymptomatic, TBEV produces a variety of clinical symptoms. TBEV is prevalent over a wide area of Eurasia, including Europe, Russia, Far Eastern Asia, and Japan (Blaskovic et al. 1967 , Korenberg and Kovalevskii 1999 , Lindgren and Gustafson 2001 and has a significant impact on public health in these endemic regions. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, TBEV can be divided into three subtypesthe Far Eastern subtype, known as Russian Spring summer encephalitis (RSSE) virus; the European subtype; and the Siberian subtype (Gritsun et al. 1993 , Wallner et al. 1995 , Gritsun et al. 1997 , Ecker et al. 1999 , Heinz et al. 2000 . In a recent study, other possible genotypes were also identified in Siberia (Tkachev et al. 2011) . TBEV is transmitted by tick bites and is maintained in the zoonotic transmission cycle between Ixodes ticks and wild vertebrate hosts. Humans are accidental hosts. The most important vertebrate hosts for TBEV are rodents, which have the highest population densities within an endemic area (generally Apodemus, Myodes, and Microtus species).",

Although the multiplication in the blood and peripheral organs was similar for both strains, the multiplication in the brain was slightly higher in Oshima 08-As than in Oshima 5-10. These data imply that Oshima 08-As was more neuroinvasive than Oshima 5-10 or that Oshima 08-As replicates more efficiently in neural cells. Early in-flammatory responses were observed with the viral multiplication in brain infected with Oshima 08-As, compared with the mice infected with Oshima 5-10. In our previous study, systemic inflammatory and stress responses were involved in fatal infection following the subcutaneous infection of mice with the Oshima 5-10 strain (Hayasaka et al. 2009 ). The induction of the systemic inflammatory and stress responses by viral multiplication might be involved in the greater virulence of Oshima 08-As. It has been shown that naturally occurring mutations affect the pathogenic properties of circulating TBEV (Gritsun et al. 2003 , Ruzek et al. 2008 , Ruzek et al. 2009 ). Only 12 amino acid differences exist between Oshima 08-As and Oshima 5-10, but none of them are previously reported amino acid residues that affect the virulence of TBEV. The identification of critical residues that affect the virulence might contribute to the understanding regarding the pathogenicity of the Oshima strains.",

It is possible that inhabitants in the endemic area may have been infected by attenuated TBEV strains and acquired immunity against TBEV. In summary, we isolated TBEV strain Oshima 08-As from a wild rodent captured in Hokuto in 2008 and showed that a few naturally occurring mutations affect the virulence of the endemic Oshima strains. These results are important for monitoring TBEV to evaluate the epidemiological risk in the endemic area of Hokkaido.",
