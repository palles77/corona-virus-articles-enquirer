Previously, it was demonstrated that passive immunization by providing hyperimmune egg yolk through the feed reduces Campylobacter jejuni colonization in broilers. Campylobacteriosis is the most commonly reported bacterial foodborne zoonosis worldwide, and poultry products are the number one origin of these bacteria for human infection. To date, no effective control measures exist to limit Campylobacter colonization in the chicken's intestinal tract. Here, the effect of lyophilization of hyperimmune egg yolk on protection of broilers against C. jejuni was investigated. During an in vivo trial, broiler chickens were prophylactically given feed with lyophilized hyperimmune or non-immunized egg yolk powder starting from day 1 after hatch. At day 11, broilers were inoculated with C. jejuni according to a seeder model. Five days later, all broilers were euthanized and cecal content was examined for C. jejuni colonization. No decrease in C. jejuni colonization was found. The freeze-drying resulted in a 16-fold decrease of the antibody titer in the yolk powder compared to the fresh yolks, presumably caused by structural changes in the antibodies. In conclusion, applying freeze-dried hyperimmune egg yolk failed to protect broilers against C. jejuni colonization, possibly because lyophilization affected the antibodies' functionality.",

Campylobacter infection is the most commonly reported bacterial foodborne zoonosis in the European Union since 2005 (EFSA, 2017) and is mainly derived from poultry products. In most cases, clinical symptoms such as fever and diarrhea are self-limiting. However, complications may occur, such as reactive arthritis (Hannu et al., 2002) and Guillain-Barr e syndrome (Nachamkin, 2002) . Unfortunately, no effective measures to control Campylobacter infection in poultry exist to date (Hermans et al., 2011b) . In our previous study (Vandeputte et al., 2019a) , vaccination of layer hens resulted in a high and prolonged immune response, observed as the presence of high amounts of anti-Campylobacter IgY in the egg yolk. This hyperimmune yolk was administered to the feed of the broilers at a concentration of 5%, resulting in a decrease of infected birds from 78 to 15%. However, under field conditions, egg yolk as such cannot be implemented and therefore an alternative administration method for these antibodies should be developed.",

Lyophilized egg yolks were first diluted 1/2 (wt/ vol) in HBSS because half of the egg yolk consists of water (Bizanov, 2017) . The supernatant, containing the water-soluble fraction of the egg yolk, was collected for IgY quantification using ELISA. To determine egg yolk IgY titers, 96-well flat bottom plates (Nunc Maxi-Sorp, Nalge Nunc Int., Rochester, NY, USA) were coated (24 h, 4 C) with 10 6 cfu (before killing) bacterin diluted in a 50 mL coating buffer (2.16 g Na 2 CO 3 .10H 2 O, 1.935 g NaHCO 3 in 500 mL H 2 O).

The colonization data were analyzed using a hurdle model, a class of models that assumes that the data are generated by 2 processes. First, the event that an individual is colonized (i.e., returning a non-zero count) follows a Bernoulli distribution. Given colonization, its intensity or load is a random variable following a discrete or continuous distribution; in this case, a gamma distribution was assumed. The model was used to estimate the probability of C. jejuni colonization and the mean C. jejuni numbers in the cecal content of colonized birds for each treatment level. Next, the pairwise differences between those and the proportion of the respective posterior distributions that had the same sign as the mean were calculated. If working in a nullhypothesis significance testing framework, this can be interpreted as a one-sided test, estimating the probability that the true difference between treatments is zero or greater (if negative) or smaller (if positive), and thus the level of confidence that the null hypothesis can be rejected. For a detailed description of the implementation in R, reference is made to Vandeputte et al., (2019a) .",
