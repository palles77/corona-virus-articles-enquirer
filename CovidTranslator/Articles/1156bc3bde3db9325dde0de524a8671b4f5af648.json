COVID-19 poses significant threats to international health. Like the flu, COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person between people who are in close contact with one another through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In light of the infectious nature of this disease, healthcare workers are at high risk of infection of COVID-19. In China, healthcare workers account for 1,716 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including six deaths [3] .",

All typical and atypical imaging features of the disease should be made known to all radiologists to assist in recognition of the disease on images and to allow accurate reporting of these findings. We have stored images of all probable cases of COVID-19 in the PACS so that these images were readily available for any radiologist to review, and images from previous imaging studies are also available for comparison. Our diagnostic process is limited as chest CT along is not diagnostic of COVID-19 because of lack of imaging specificity. But when combined with other epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and virus nucleic acid information, typical chest CT imaging findings are helpful for making the diagnosis. In our opinion, the major role of chest CT is to understand the extent and dynamic evolution of lung lesions induced by COVID-19. The reasons why we adopted the low-dose chest CT scan protocol are as follows: low-dose chest CT has been widely used in the screening of early lung cancer. It is well known that many early lung cancers are ground-glass opacities (GGO), so we believe that low-dose screening is also applicable for COVID-19. In addition, considering the rapid development of COVID-19, many CT examinations may be conducted in the same individual to monitor disease progress. Low-dose scanning can reduce the radiation damage to patients.",
