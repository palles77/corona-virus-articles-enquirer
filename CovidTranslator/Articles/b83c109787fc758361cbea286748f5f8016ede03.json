            "text": "According to Jerne's network hypothesis, the binding site of an anti-idiotypic antibody also represents the internal image of an epitope present on a foreign, or even a self antigen. In recent years, antigen mimicry has been de\u00aened at the molecular level for some xeno-antigens. However, until now there has been no demonstration of structural mimicry between a human anti-idiotypic antibody and a self structure. To address this question, we used human IgE as the self structure and a well-de\u00aened anti-human IgE mAb (BSW17). We describe the isolation of two antiidiotypic antibodies speci\u00aec for the anti-IgE antibody BSW17 from a non-immune human Fab phage display library. Interestingly, these two anti-idiotypic antibodies mimic the same molecular surface region as a previously described IgE peptide mimotope isolated by panning on BSW17, but they cover a much larger epitope on the IgE molecule. Accordingly, immunisation of rabbits with the two anti-idiotypic antibodies induced high-af\u00aenity antibodies with the same characteristics as BSW17. Thus, our data demonstrate that it is possible to isolate anti-idiotypic antibodies derived from the human genome without the need for hyperimmunisation, and con\u00aerm Jerne's hypothesis that both foreign antigens and self structures can be mimicked by our own immunoglobulins.",

            "text": "The immune network theory proposes the idea that anti-idiotypic antibodies are produced during the immune response to a given antigen (Jerne, 1974) . A subset of these anti-idiotypic antibodies, termed internal image antibodies, or Ab2b, are able to mimic the molecular structure of the nominal antigen (Jerne et al., 1982; Pan et al., 1995) . Such anti-idiotypic antibodies have been successfully isolated and characterised from animals immunised with external antigens (Goldbaum et al., 1998; Bona, 1996; Pan et al., 1995) . In humans, natu-rally occurring auto-anti-idiotypic antibodies have been detected serologically in patients with autoimmune diseases, but also in normal donors (Jayne et al., 1993; Bronshtein et al., 1992; Zouali & Eyquem, 1983) . However, the isolation and characterisation of such antibodies has not been achieved on the monoclonal level using conventional hybridoma technology (Ko \u00c8 hler & Milstein, 1975) . We have previously shown that human anti-idiotypic antibodies against human IgE can be isolated from a non-immune repertoire using phage display technology (Vogel et al., 1994) . Here, we used the same technology to isolate human anti-idiotypic Fab fragments able to mimic an epitope from the constant part of human IgE. To de\u00aene such an epitope, we used a monoclonal anti-human (mAb) IgE antibody, termed BSW17 (Knutti-Mueller et al., 1986) . With this mAb we had screened phage-displayed random peptide libraries and isolated peptides mimicking an epitope located in the third and fourth constant domain of IgE (Rudolf et al., 1998 (Rudolf et al., , 2000 . Here, we address the question of whether it would be possible to isolate an anti-idiotypic antibody that mimics the same epitope ( Figure 1) .",

RNA was extracted from each source and used independently to prepare PCR-ampli\u00aeed cDNA corresponding to the variable heavy chain immunoglobulin (Ig) region and a part of the constant region of IgG1 (Fd) and the Ig light chains k and l. The cDNAs were cloned into the pComb3 vector system, and Fab libraries from the three different sources were expressed separately on the surface of \u00aelamentous phage and then pooled for further use. To select anti-Id antibodies speci\u00aec for BSW17, the pooled libraries were subjected to four rounds of biopanning on solid-phase BSW17 (Marks et al., 1991) . After the last round of panning, eight positive clones were selected out of 50 clones, and all of them recognised the antigenbinding site of BSW17. This was demonstrated in an inhibition assay where the binding of the Fab clones to BSW17 was inhibited by the two previously isolated IgE mimotopes corresponding to the third and fourth domain of IgE (data not shown).",

Sequence analysis revealed that only two types of Fab clones were isolated. Figure 2 shows the deduced amino acid sequences of the two anti-Id Fab clones compared with the most homologous germline genes. The two Fab clones (anti-Id-BSW17.52 and anti-Id-BSW17.43) showed the highest level of homology to two genes derived from different VH families, 22-2 B from VH3 and DP-65 from VH4. The VH CDR3 regions of both clones were also markedly different in length and sequence, suggesting that they originated from two different B-cell clones. Further, the light chains of these Fab clones were homologous to two different germline genes belonging to different families, Vk1 and Vl1 ( Figure 2 ). The V-genes of both clones showed several differences from the germline V-gene segments, suggesting that they are derived from somatically mutated B-cells. As the source of our immunoglobulin genes was a pool of three donors, we cannot conclude whether the anti-idiotypic speci\u00aecities were derived from one individual or whether both speci\u00aecities may actually be present in all three donors.",

Remarkably, the previously isolated Ce3 peptide mimotope speci\u00aec to BSW17 revealed homology with a similar region of the Ce3 domain corresponding to residues Val370 to Ser375 (Figure 4 (a); Rudolf et al., 2000) .",

Visual and computational analysis revealed that the VH of both Fab clones, as well as a part of the Ce3 mimotope, share sequence homology and mimic a common IgE epitope covering the region from Thr373 to Asn383 (Figure 4(a) ). This common epitope emerges on the surface of the IgE molecule and has considerable surface solvent accessibility. These data, and the fact that structural analysis of the common epitope revealed a b-turn, support the prediction that this region is antigenic (Chou et al., 1978) and is recognised by BSW17 as described by Knutti-Mueller et al. (1986) . Furthermore, this region has been reported to overlap with the possible IgE-binding site of the high-af\u00aenity IgE receptor. Using alanine scanning mutagenesis, two amino acid residues (Arg376, Ser378) present in this region were found to be directly involved in high-af\u00aenity receptor binding (Presta et al., 1994; Helm et al., 1996) .",

Furthermore, two residues, Arg427 and Met430, present in this homologous region have been shown by Presta et al.

To assess this functional mimicry, two rabbits were immunised with soluble anti-Id-BSW17.52 and anti-Id-BSW17.43 Fab preparations four times at two-week intervals; after seven weeks, the sera were tested for anti-IgE activity. Because the Ce3 epitope region, mimicked by the heavy and light chains of both anti-Id Fab clones, has been shown to be involved in high-af\u00aenity receptor binding, the antibodies raised against the two anti-Id Fab clones were expected to inhibit binding of IgE to its high-af\u00aenity receptor by blocking the IgEbinding domain. To assess this inhibitory activity, the rabbit antisera were \u00aerst af\u00aenity-puri\u00aeed on human IgE and then tested in an inhibition ELISA. Figure 5 shows that the two puri\u00aeed rabbit IgG preparations inhibit the binding of IgE to the a-chain of FceRI. However, the af\u00aenity-puri\u00aeed IgG of the rabbit immunised with the second anti-Id BSW17.43 Fab showed a stronger inhibition of IgE binding to the a-chain than the IgG puri\u00aeed from the rabbit immunised with the \u00aerst anti-Id BSW17.52 Fab. Using surface plasmon resonance in the BIAcore system (Malborg et al., 1996) , the af\u00aenity of both puri-\u00aeed IgG preparations to human IgE was determined. The polyclonal anti-anti-idiotypic IgG preparation puri\u00aeed from the rabbits immunised with anti-Id BSW17.52 and anti-Id BSW17.43 bound to human IgE with K d of 6 \u00c2 10 9 M \u00c01 and of 4 \u00c2 10 10 M \u00c01 , respectively. This result suggests that both anti-Id can act as a functional image of the IgE molecule. Accordingly, the anti-Id BSW17.43 Fab, which shows the closest molecular mimicry to the IgE molecule, induces antibodies in vivo with the greatest inhibitory effect and the highest af\u00aenity to the IgE molecule.

Animals were bled seven days after the last injection. To purify rabbit serum, the IgG fraction was \u00aerst isolated by precipitation in 45 % saturated ammonium sulphate. After resuspension and dialysis against PBS at 4 C, Fab was puri\u00aeed on an af\u00aenity column (CH-Sepharose 4B, Pharmacia, LKB Biotechnology, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) coupled to human IgE. The dialysed fraction was \u00aeltered on a 0.2 mm MILLEX-GV \u00aelter unit (Millipore) and applied to the column equilibrated with PBS at a\u00afow rate of 2 ml/minute. Th\u0113 owthrough was pooled and, after washing with PBS, the IgG was eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.8) and neutralised immediately with 3.3 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).

After washing, 100 ng/ml of peroxidase-labelled recombinant FceRI (Nechansky et al., 1997) was added for a second incubation of two hours at 37 C. The wells were washed, and the amount of bound FceRIa chain was determined by colour reaction using chromogenic o-phenylene diamine dihydrochloride (OPD; Sigma) OPD substrate.

            "text": "Although functional mimicry has been reported for some anti-idiotypic antibodies mimicking self antigens, there have been no studies to date that have demonstrated structural similarity between self antigens and human anti-idiotypic antibodies. Mouse monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies that mimic self structures have already been reported (Lubahn et al., 1990; Taub et al., 1992; Abrams et al., 1992; Garcia et al., 1992; Perosa et al., 1994) . Garcia et al. (1992) described a system using angiotensin which is a phylogenetically conserved octapeptide and thus can be considered as a self antigen. In this system, rabbit polyclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) speci\u00aec to a monoclonal anti-angiotensin (Ab1) were used to obtain anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab3). The conformation of the angiotensin in the complex with Ab3 has suggested that a CDR of the Ab2 could have elicited the angiotensin-speci\u00aec Ab3. However, due to the polyclonal nature of the anti-idiotypic antibodies, no structural study of Ab2 was performed to con\u00aerm this hypothesis. In our system we have isolated two human monoclonal human anti-idotypic antibodies and demonstrated amino acid sequence-based structural homology by identifying the cross-reactive residues responsible for the mimicry. Additionally, we have shown that neither immunisation nor af\u00aenity maturation is a prerequisite for generating high-af\u00aenity anti-idiotypic antibodies from phage display libraries. Recently, the isolation of human recombinant anti-idiotypic scFv against coronavirus from a non-immune phage display library has been reported (Lamarre & Talbot, 1997) . However, these scFv antibodies were not able to induce an antiviral immune response suf\u00aeciently strong to protect immunised animals. In our case, the fact that two human anti-idiotypic Fab fragments behaved as surrogate antigens and induced an anti-IgE response in rabbits may circumvent the problem of using non-human antibodies in humans. Preliminary results of monkey immunisations have shown that the anti-idiotypic antibodies can induce an anti-IgE response that is able to abolish partially reactivity in an in vivo passive cutaneous anaphylaxis test in the case of allergen challenge. Thus, the anti-idiotypic antibodies can be used as an active vaccine analogous to the IgE mimotope peptides that have been previously isolated and are currently in the preclinical testing phase. Clearly, the anti-idiotypic antibodies represent a much larger epitope of IgE than the mimotope derived from random phage peptide libraries. Moreover, in a vaccination procedure these antiidiotypic antibodies may be better tolerated than peptides that have to be coupled to immunogenic carriers. Thus, it can be expected that in humans the anti-idiotypic antibodies will induce, as already seen in monkeys, an anti-IgE immune response that would prevent binding of IgE to the FceRI, and consequently the sensitisation of the effector cells implicated in allergic disease.",

(a) Computer-simulated model of IgE Ce2-Ce4 domains depicting Ce3 regions homologous to anti-Id-BSW17 VH regions and Ce3 mimotope amino acid residues. (b) Computer-simulated model of IgE Ce2-Ce4 domains depicting Ce3 regions homologous to anti-Id-BSW17 VH and VL regions. For each comparison with the Ce3 domain, different colour schemes were chosen. Colour intensities are de\u00aened according to the homology: dark or light colours for identical or similar residues, respectively. The homology was calculated according to the algorithm developed byLipman et al. (1985).",
