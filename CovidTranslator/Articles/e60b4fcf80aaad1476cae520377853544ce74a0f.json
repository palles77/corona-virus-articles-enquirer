One of the most common ways to identify these antigens is to measure cellular proliferation (T or B cells) upon in vitro stimulation with antigen.

Screening methods are used to identify antigens that can stimulate CD4 \u00fe or CD8 \u00fe T cells, or which bind to antibodies from humans known to have been infected with the relevant pathogen. Where peptide screening uses antibodies, an additional consideration is the synthesis of antigens that contain the tertiary (folding/three-dimensional) structure of the native immunogen, since vaccine efficacy can be impacted by infidelities in the structure of the final product. Incorrect protein folding may result in a less immunogenic antigen or an antigen that induces an immune response that differs from that of the native immunogen. The mimicking of the three-dimensional structure of the native immunogen is important during the synthesis of antigens that are being used to target B-cell responses. Conversely, the requirement for folding is reduced for T cells since T cells bind only processed peptides, from degraded proteins. Likewise, DNA expression libraries using the pathogen genomic DNA have been screened using animal model systems to identify genes encoding proteins that afford protection against infection or disease caused by the pathogen.",

The gene(s) for target antigen(s) is/are usually encoded in a circular plasmid expression vector under the control of promoter sequences that direct gene expression in mammalian cells, which is achieved after injection into mammals.

The information included is not meant to be exhaustive but is intended to provide an overview of the subject matter. Ongoing research on alternative experimental administration strategies includes ballistic delivery to skin (the gene gun), the transdermal patch and other intradermal methods, plus sublingual, aerosol, rectal and vaginal mucosal vaccines. The main advantages of alternative delivery strategies are the potential to induce immune responses at the common portals of pathogen entry (eg oral polio vaccine replicating in the gut), potential convenience (eg ease of use of the transdermal patch), potential combination of vaccines to reduce or simplify the vaccination schedule, and reduction or elimination of administration via standard hypodermic needle injection. Despite the intuitive value of these approaches, few vaccines today are administered via non-IM routes. This is for several reasons including feasibility, lack of proven efficacy and limited safety data. Some problems have been observed with new routes of delivery, for example, after the 2000 launch of an inactivated intranasal influenza vaccine (a virosome formulation adjuvanted by heat labile enterotoxoid of Escherichia coli), post-licensure data indicated a significantly increased risk of Bell's palsy in vaccinees and forced its withdrawal from the market. This experience led to a higher level of caution in the development of intranasal vaccines. Today, the only example of a licensed vaccine against a latent infection is the zoster vaccine; the vaccine formulation is the high potency (about 15-fold) version of the live, attenuated varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine. This vaccine has been used to boost the anti-VZV cell-mediated immune response in older subjects and has been shown to reduce the overall incidence of zoster by 50% in subjects aged 60 years or older (Oxman et al., 2005) .",

The intent of prime-boost vaccination is to induce different types of immune responses and enhance the overall immune response, a result that may not occur if only one type of vaccine were to be given for all doses.

The development of an effective vaccine has been challenging; natural immunity to RSV infection is incomplete and re-infections occur in all age groups. Moreover, the primary target population for vaccination is newborns and young infants, and they are a challenging population as they have relatively immature immune systems and the presence of maternal antibodies may interfere with vaccination of the young infant (see Chapter 2 e Vaccine immunology). The initial efforts to develop a formalin-inactivated cell culture-derived RSV vaccine resulted in an unanticipated enhancement of natural RSV disease in some of the RSV-na\u00efve infants who received the vaccine in a clinical trial and subsequently were exposed to RSV. The exacerbated disease is thought to be due to an exaggerated T helper type 2 cell immune response (see Chapter 2 e Vaccine immunology). Safety concerns regarding the potential of vaccines to trigger or prime for immunopathological responses has resulted in a cautious approach to the development of RSV vaccines. The vaccine candidates most advanced in clinical development use two different approaches e one uses a live, attenuated virus with a gene deletion deliberately targeted to minimise immunopathological responses. The other approach uses a live viral vector to deliver only a key RSV surface antigen, thereby avoiding the risk of an immunopathological response arising from exposure to the RSV virus itself.",

A recent study showed that immunisation with an acellular pertussis vaccine at birth and 1 month of age induces high IgG anti-pertussis antibody titres by 2 months of age (Wood et al., 2010) . It is hoped that this approach may reduce death and morbidity from Bordetella pertussis infection in the first 3 months of life.",

In the late 1990s, an influenza vaccine adjuvanted with the oil-in-water emulsion, MF59\u00d4, was shown to be more effective at inducing high immune responses in the elderly (Minutello et al., 1999) . Alternative vaccine administration techniques have also been studied in the elderly. Research showed that in subjects 60 years of age or older, an influenza vaccine administered with an intradermal microinjection system induced significantly higher antibody titres compared with IM vaccination (Arnou et al., 2009 ). Subsequently, a microinjection system influenza vaccine was licensed for use in Europe, and a high antigen dose formulation has been licensed for the elderly in the USA.",

Patients can also be immunocompromised as a result of therapy, eg when receiving an organ transplant, radiation therapy or immunosuppressive medication. Such patients are therefore at an elevated risk of infection from pathogens such as herpesviruses (particularly CMV and EpsteineBarr virus), HBV, HCV, pneumocystis and coinfections and represent a special population regarding immunisation. Despite a likely reduction in the efficacy of vaccinations in immunocompromised individuals, immunisation remains a frequent recommendation in the hope that at least partial immunity will be achieved. Eliciting a response from vaccination in immunocompromised patients may require an increase in the dose and/or number of doses; altering the dosing interval; selecting a different vaccine formulation; or administration via an alternative route. Evidence in this patient population is lacking and guidelines are often based on theoretical assumptions.",

New approaches to antigen selection and production, antigen delivery, adjuvantation and vaccine administration will allow us to target established and emerging diseases, and populations with complex needs. Vaccination has been one of the most successful and cost-effective health interventions ever conceived and is now expanding further into cancer and chronic diseases.

Circulating Circulating HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; CRFs, circulating recombinant forms. Development of HIV vaccines: the toughest task? Development of a vaccine for HIV/AIDS is exceptionally difficult due to HIV targeting of key immune cells during infection; the marked variability in HIV strain sequence and antigenicity between and within individuals; the lack of understanding of successful immune control; and the failure to reproduce in humans the results of successful vaccine trials in monkey (simian immunodeficiency virus [SIV]) models. Recent human trials aimed at inducing CD8 \u00fe lymphocyte cytotoxicity (the key immune effector in SIV trials) have failed, probably because the induced repertoire lacks sufficient potency and breadth of specificity. Vaccine development has been spurred however, by the ability of human 'elite controllers' and old world monkeys to control viral load and/or disease; by the recent demonstration that broad neutralising antibody to HIV can be induced in humans; and by the 2009 'Thai vaccine trial' which demonstrated, for the first time, limited efficacy of an HIV vaccine.",

The 2009 'Thai vaccine trial' suggested a need to examine the role of nonneutralising antibody and the possibility of preventing HIV acquisition, not just progressive immunodeficiency. A better understanding of the multiple subsets of CD4 \u00fe lymphocytes in HIV infection and the role of DCs as initial targets for infection are at the forefront of these new efforts. New hybrid viral vectors, synthetic antigens (developed with the aid of three-dimensional modelling), novel adjuvants that manipulate the immune system to induce desirable responses and more useful animal models are also being developed and tested. Development of vaccines that induce broad neutralising antibodies to highly variable viruses, such as HIV and influenza, has proved to be extremely difficult. However, screening HIV-infected individuals for such antibodies has allowed the identification of previously undiscovered viral epitopes which can be incorporated into structure-based vaccine design.",

The merozoites can also develop into male and female gametocytes, lysing the blood cells upon maturation. A blood feed by another mosquito allows uptake of the gametocytes. Sexual reproduction within the mosquito generates oocysts that eventually rupture and release sporozoites that subsequently migrate to the mosquito's salivary gland to restart the life cycle when the mosquito feeds. Candidate vaccines have been designed to target the pre-erythrocytic, blood and transmission stages of the life cycle.",
