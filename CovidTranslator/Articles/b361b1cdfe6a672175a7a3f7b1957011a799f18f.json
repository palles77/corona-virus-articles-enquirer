No guidelines have been proposed to choose the reporting interval of infectious diseases. The present study aims at translating coarsely reported epidemic data into the reproduction number and clarifying the ideal reporting interval to offer detailed insights into the time course of an epidemic. We briefly revisit the dispersibility ratio, i.e. ratio of cases in successive reporting intervals, proposed by Clare Oswald Stallybrass, detecting technical flaws in the historical studies. We derive a corrected expression for this quantity and propose simple algorithms to estimate the effective reproduction number as a function of time, adjusting the reporting interval to the generation time of a disease and demonstrating a clear relationship among the generation-time distribution, reporting interval and growth rate of an epidemic. Our exercise suggests that an ideal reporting interval is the mean generation time, so that the ratio of cases in successive intervals can yield the reproduction number. When it is impractical to report observations every mean generation time, we also present an alternative method that enables us to obtain straightforward estimates of the reproduction number for any reporting interval that suits the practical purpose of infection control.",

However, we expect that the epidemic curve spikes when successive waves of infections result in successive waves of reported cases, and in this sense, using bin width as recommended by density estimation (i.e. the reporting interval informed by the smoothing method) could suggest too coarse bins that smooth out several generations of cases occurring in a single reporting interval. To interpret the time course of an epidemic, case notifications are used to estimate a key variable that characterizes transmissibility with time. The effective reproduction number at time t, R t , defined as the average number of secondary cases per primary case at time t (for t . 0), is a useful measure to inform about the transmission potential of a disease and indications of the expected number of secondary transmissions and of control efforts required to curb the epidemic (Ferguson et al. 2001 (Ferguson et al. , 2005 Haydon et al. 2003; Wallinga & Teunis 2004; Cauchemez et al. 2006a,b; Fraser 2007; Garske et al. 2007; White & Pagano 2008a,b) . There are algorithms for transforming epidemic curves into the time course of R t (Wallinga & Teunis 2004; Cauchemez et al. 2006a ), but these require symptom onsets in fine time scale. Although the most precise reporting interval (e.g. reporting in a continuous time scale) would certainly yield the most ideal interpretation of the transmission dynamics, it is often impractical to report cases on an hourly or daily basis.",

Dispersibility was defined as a measurement of the 'total effect of factors affecting the spread of any specific infection at a given time and place' (Stallybrass 1931) , the factors of which he discussed include 'sometimes intrinsic but more often depending upon either external or secondary factors'.

Nevertheless, the ratios did not highlight epidemiological characteristics (e.g. generation time) of the disease, not allowing the comparison of ratios obtained for different diseases.

Similar to equation (4.1), the exponential growth with constant r k in a given reporting interval k is interpreted as an identical growth rate between subpopulations in a heterogeneously mixing population (i.e. the exponential growth rate r k is shared among the subpopulations). Figure 4a shows the estimated R k using the daily incidence of the Spanish influenza pandemic in San Francisco. Although there is not yet a consensus on the generation time of influenza, with estimates ranging from 2.6 to 5.3 days (Fraser 2007) , here we assume for simplicity that the mean m is 3 days following recent studies (Carrat et al. 2008; White & Pagano 2008a ). If we further assume that the generation-time distribution is given by a delta function, we can calculate R k \u00bc exp(mr k ), and make a comparison between our approximate R k and another approximate R t by each generation time (i.e. equation (4.2)). Again, we observe wide uncertainty bounds for R k , where there are only a small number of cases. Nevertheless, even when we only have weekly reports of influenza in hand (figure 4b), figure 4c visually confirms overall a good approximation of R k to R t . Note that R k is drawn according to the corresponding reporting interval k. Although the precision of R k is limited for the coarsely reported data (see below), R k based on weekly reports (or the prediction based on equation (4.4)) perfectly predicts the observed weekly data. It should be noted that the approximate R k is still useful to observe the threshold condition (where R k , 1), enabling us to understand the time course of an epidemic. It should also be noted that we get R k . 1 for the fifth week of the epidemic (figure 4c), even though the number of cases in the next interval (i.e. sixth week) was smaller; this reflects dependency between adjacent reporting intervals (i.e. equation (4.4) ). If we assume random mixing of individuals, 1 2 1/R k suggests a required control effort to contain an epidemic (e.g. required coverage of mass vaccination in a given interval). Although homogeneous mixing is often not the case in reality, figure 4d would inform public health experts about an estimate of required effort and allow an assessment of control measures. Figure 4e shows time variations in the estimated reproduction numbers obtained from weekly data, assuming three different mean generation times (i.e. 2, 3 and 4 days). When R k . 1, the longer the generation time, the higher the R k we get; i.e. our analytical understanding in equation (4.5) is maintained even when the observation is coarsely reported. The relationship between the generation time and R k is reversed when R k , 1. Figure 5a compares the approximated epidemic curves with the observed Spanish influenza cases in San Francisco in 1918 (Department of Hygiene, Japanese Ministry of Interior 1922). As the reporting interval increases, the quality of the approximation is diminished. Figure 5b measures the deviation of approximated curves from observed data as a function of reporting interval. The saturated model, which is useful when the number of parameters equals the number of data points, is employed, allowing comparison of the deviance (i.e. lack of fit) between different reporting intervals. Although a more explicit test of significance cannot be employed, figure 5b shows that a reporting interval whose length is two or three times the mean generation time still approximates well the crude picture of the epidemic curve; e.g. a reporting interval of 7 days yields smaller deviance (x 2 \u00bc 889.8) than that of 5 days (x 2 \u00bc 3436.4). However, when the interval is too long compared with generation time, the deviance is too large, and it is certainly difficult to capture the observed epidemic pattern. Furthermore, it should be noted that the prediction of weekly reports based on our algorithms is not influenced by the true length of generation time; as can be seen from equation (4.4), the linear approximation to the observed epidemic curve is independent of the generation-time distribution. The precision of approximating R k using a fixed reporting interval is influenced by the length of generation time. Reporting intervals that are shorter or close to the mean generation time yield more precise R k than longer reporting intervals ( \u00a75).",

Although the interval of case notification may frequently be influenced by administrative factors, we believe that the present study provides a basis to choose the reporting interval, thereby offering a practical guide for the relevant considerations. With historical reference to Stallybrass's dispersibility ratio (Stallybrass 1931) , we have shown that the ratio of cases in successive reporting intervals is an interpretable measure in a special case (i.e. constant R over time), clarifying technical flaws in the original descriptions by Stallybrass. Moreover, explicitly adjusting the reporting interval to mean generation time, we extended Stallybrass's dispersibility ratio to estimate R t , approximating the observed epidemic curve by assuming constant growth rates in each reporting interval. Approximating R t can still capture thresholds and suggest required control efforts, helping public health experts understand the time course explicitly.",

When a single reporting interval does not include several different generations, a short reporting interval with n , 1 can more precisely reflect the transmissibility with time, because n , 1 indicates that infection of cases observed in an interval more likely had happened in previous intervals (not within the same interval) than the case for n . 1, allowing us to precisely capture R t . Both of our proposed algorithms assume linear growth in each interval, by considering the corresponding interval as separate from its adjacent intervals. Theoretically, it is certainly better to have more precise data (e.g. observation in a continuous time scale) than coarsely reported data in order to fully capture the dependency of infected individuals between adjacent time periods. Considering that only the ratio can account for the dependency between infected individuals in our approaches, we get a straightforward conclusion for our second algorithm: the smaller n is and the smaller the variance-to-mean ratio of the generation-time distribution is, the more precise the estimates of R k that are obtained.

This technical limitation is identical to that of the method given previously (Wallinga & Teunis 2004) , and therefore a different approach has to be employed for slowly progressing diseases (Gran et al. 2008) . Moreover, the distribution of generation times has to be carefully interpreted for approximation, especially when the distribution is right skewed. Although the mean generation time, m, is used to calculate the correcting factor, the variance-to-mean ratio needs to be examined in relation to the doubling time to precisely suggest the length of the reporting interval (appendix A 1). When the generation-time distribution is skewed, our second algorithm should be used to estimate R t because equation (4.5) translates the exponential growth rates in each reporting interval to R t , highlighting the skewed nature of the generation-time distribution. The estimate of R t is obtained without too apparent deviations from the observed data when the reporting interval is two or three times the mean generation time, but the approximation is worsened as the interval becomes much longer than the mean generation time.",

For example, monthly influenza reports (figure 1) may well include n . 10 generations per interval (assuming that m , 3 days) where our linear approximation may no longer be useful for interpreting the observed epidemic curve. When n is too large, a nonlinear approximation, e.g. accounting for the depletion of susceptibles, might be needed. In addition, other strategies of approximation (e.g. power law approximation) for infection process could be conceived (Finkenstadt & Grenfell 2000; Bjornstad et al. 2002) when the motivation of analysis is not to interpret the epidemic time series with an explicit measure of transmissibility. Point (iii), as well as heterogeneous patterns in transmission, is a common concern for real-time epidemic modelling (Wallinga & Teunis 2004; Cauchemez et al. 2006a; Fraser 2007 ) that has to be addressed as more detailed data become available (e.g. cases with time and place and with the length of reporting delay). For instance, in addition to a full clarification of the impact of reporting delay on the estimation framework of R t , improvements in the observation and reporting are needed (rather than adding mechanistic model assumptions).

In particular, the generation time in heterogeneously mixing population in relation to our condition (4.3) is a topic of future research. Moreover, it is impossible to know the generation time of a newly emerging infectious disease in a population. Therefore, besides the need to develop statistical methods for quantifying the generation-time distribution from empirical observation, it is suggested that notification of emerging infectious diseases needs to be reported as precisely as the public health authority can achieve. Moreover, when it is difficult to fully quantify the generationtime distribution, our study emphasizes the importance of quantifying, at least, the mean generation time so that we can understand the epidemiological time course.",

From our exercise, we showed that the use of the mean generation time as the ideal reference length for the reporting interval of surveillance would be extremely useful to estimate the effective reproduction number. To obtain a quick view of the time course of an epidemic, reporting cases every mean generation time would allow the estimation simply by using a ratio of cases in adjacent reporting intervals, yet saving the cost of reporting in a very short interval. Calculation of the ratio does not require difficult computations.

We assume that the intervals k and k \u00fe 1 correspond to periods (t 0 , t 0 \u00fe Dt) and (t 0 \u00fe Dt, t 0 \u00fe 2Dt), respectively, in calendar time scale, where Dt is the length of the reporting interval. We denote the incidence (i.e. number of newly infected individuals) at time t by I(t) and assume that I(t 0 ) \u00bc m, where m is constant. Following the exponential growth, we get I(t 0 \u00fe t) \u00bc m exp(r k t) (\u00bcmI k (t)) in interval k and I(t 0 \u00fe Dt \u00fe t) \u00bc I(t 0 \u00fe Dt)exp(r k\u00fe1 t) (\u00bcI(t 0 \u00fe Dt)I k\u00fe1 (t)) in interval k \u00fe 1. Accordingly, J k and J k\u00fe1 are given by Taking the ratio of J k\u00fe1 to J k , we get equation (4.4) in the main text. Maximum-likelihood estimates of r k were obtained similarly as in equation (A 6). As is done using equation (A 6), the 95 per cent CI for R k was computed by the profile likelihood. It should be noted that when r k is constant over time (\u00bcr), this results in J k\u00fe1 /J k \u00bc exp(rDt) as discussed in the main text, offering an interpretation of Stallybrass's dispersibility ratio (Stallybrass 1931) . Figure 6 . The relationship between the ideal reporting interval, variance-to-mean ratio of the generation-time distribution and the intrinsic growth rate. Sensitivity of ideal reporting interval to different variance-to-mean ratio and the intrinsic growth rate is examined for plausible ranges of the parameters for human influenza (Ferguson et al. 2005; Chowell et al. 2007; White & Pagano 2008a) . (a) The ideal reporting interval as a function of variance-to-mean ratio of the generation-time distribution. The intrinsic growth rate is fixed at 0.14 per day.
