            "text": "Three out of the five trials used liposome-mediated gene transfer strategies, one trial used Ad2 and one AAV2. Noone et al transfected the nasal epithelium of CF patients and was able to detect vector-specific DNA up to 10 days after gene transfer, but not mRNA or functional correction of the CFTR defect. 1 The discrepancy between this trial and previously published nose trials that were able to detect CFTR mRNA and partial correction of the CFTR defect, is likely due to the lower transfection efficiency of the cationic lipid used. In a dose-escalating safety trial, liposome DNA complexes were aerosolised into the lungs of CF subjects, half of which, had a transient fever, muscle and joint pain shortly after Correspondence: U Griesenbach, Department of Gene Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, London, SW3 6LR, UK and cationic liposomes) was low, and most likely insufficient to achieve clinical benefit. Here, we will review the clinical and pre-clinical progress for the last 2 years (2000-2001) and briefly speculate on future prospects for the next 2 in CF gene therapy. Gene Therapy (2002) 9, 1344-1350. doi:10.1038/sj.gt.3301791 liposome/DNA administration. 2 This was attributed to an immunological response against the liposome/DNA complexes; similar results were previously reported in a lung trial, using the same liposome/DNA formulation. Interestingly, Hyde et al demonstrated for the first time, that liposome/DNA complexes could be successfully readministered to the nose of CF patients. Each subject received three doses, administered 4 weeks apart and samples were analysed 4 days after each treatment. Six out of 10 treated subjects were positive for CFTR gene transfer after each dose. 3 Perricone et al reported the results of a phase I clinical trial, in which recombinant adenovirus (Ad2/CFTR) was administered through bronchoscopic instillation or aerosolisation to the lungs of CF patients. In contrast to previous studies, the authors carefully determined that inefficient gene expression was due to the very low transduction efficiency of Ad in human airways. In addition, the vast majority of transfected cells (97%), did not appear to be epithelial cells. 4 The authors therefore concluded that further improvements in Ad vector design are urgently required. An AAV2 vector was nebulised into the lung of CF subjects to assess delivery and safety. AAV2 administration to the lung appeared to be safe and vector genome was detected, at the highest dose, up to 30 days after administration. However, vector-specific mRNA could not be detected and therefore evidence for gene transfer was not provided. 5 In summary, these new studies consolidate the view that proof-of-principle of gene transfer can be demonstrated in some, but not all studies, but that gene transfer efficacy is currently insufficient to warrant phase II/III trials. Thus, significant improvements in all aspects of gene transfer need to be made.",

For this purpose several very effective extracellular barriers, such as mucus, the gycocalyx, tight junctions and mucociliary clearance have evolved ( Figure  1 ). Mucus, for example, reduces the transfection efficiency of most viral and non-viral gene transfer agents. However, transfection efficiency could be increased through pre-treatment with mucolytics or the antichiolinergic drug glycopyrolate in vitro and in vivo. 6 In addition to mucus, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid recovered from CF patients have been shown to inhibit liposome, 7 adenovirus 8 and AAV-mediated gene transfer efficiency. 9 Although recombinant DNase reduced sputum viscoelasticity and improved nanosphere migration in vitro, 10 the effect of DNase on gene transfer in vivo is unclear. To avoid the confounding effect of sputum in vivo, gene transfer should ideally be studied in CF children, before their lungs become filled with secretions. Indirect evidence has indicated, that the glycocalyx is also a barrier to gene transfer and that neu- Gene Therapy roaminidase enhances Ad transfection of polarised cells in vitro. 11 Receptors for Ad and AAV2 are located on the basolateral membrane of human airway epithelial cells and uptake of non-viral gene transfer agents also appears to be enhanced on the basolateral site, due to the presence of heparan receptors and a higher endocytosis rate.

Although a 10-to 50-fold increase in virus-and non-virus-mediated gene transfer was generally seen in vitro, it is unlikely that the opening of tight junctions, even if transient, will be clinically applicable, given that the airways of most CF patients are heavily colonised with bacteria.",

Most remarkably, it was demonstrated for the first time in vivo that CF-related secondary defects (nitric oxide synthase-2 and sodium hyper-absorption) were partially correctable through gene therapy as well. 19 Targeting of sec-R has been successful in increasing airway gene transfer and several groups are currently trying to identify new peptides that bind to airway epithelial cells and promote targeted receptor-mediated endocytosis, using phage display libraries. 20 ",

            "text": "As mentioned above, the density of receptors for Ad and AAV2 on the apical membrane of human airway epithelial cells is low, which explains in part the inefficient transfection efficiency. Multiple approaches have been studied to overcome this problem. Firstly, several new recombinant viruses have been identified, that appear to be able to enter epithelial cells via the apical membrane efficiently. In addition to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 21 Sendai virus (SeV) 22 has recently been shown to transfect bronchial epithelial cells efficiently in vivo. Two days after infection with SeV 80% of airway epithelial cells expressed the \u2424-galactosidase transgene (Figure 2a ). SeV uses binding to cholesterol and sialic acid as receptors, which are both present at the apical membrane of airway epithelial cells. In addition, SeV is not greatly inhibited by mucus. AAV entry into airway epithelial cells appears to be serotype-specific and AAV5 has been shown to transfect airway epithelial cells five times more efficiently than AAV2. 23, 24 AAV in general is a very promising gene transfer agent. Not only does the virus maintain prolonged transgene expression due to integration or concatemerisation of the vector genome, but it is also thought that the virus might be less immunogenic, due to the fact that it does not appear to transduce antigenpresenting dendritic cells. Some reports have suggested that AAV could be repeatedly administered to the lung. However, this possibility has recently been ruled out unless different serotypes or some form of immunosuppression are used. 25 An important limitation of AAV as gene transfer vector for CF has been its limited packaging capacity. However, it has recently been demonstrated that this problem can be overcome by using trans-splicing or overlapping vectors 26 or by shortening the CFTR cDNA. 27 Secondly, proof-of-principle has been established that adeno and AAV vectors can be retargeted to apical surface receptors, such as the bradykinin, 28 the urokinase plasminigen 29 and the P2Y 2 -purinoreceptor 30 in vitro. However, it remains to be established if these approaches will increase transfection efficiency in vivo.",

The treatment of CF with gene therapy will therefore require repeated administrations of gene transfer agents, which is a particular problem for viruses. Strategies such as administration of immunosuppressants and corticosteroids, and treatments aimed at transiently blocking CD4 + T cells 34 have been evaluated for repeated administration of adenovirus. However, the success of these strategies has been limited. In general, repeated administration was possible a few times, but ultimately lead to reduced and finally absent transgene expression. The only exception so far is a report by Kolb et al, who demonstrated that administration of the steroid budesonide enabled adenovirus to be re-administered at least five times without loss of transfection efficiency. 35 Importantly, treatment with an anti-CD40 ligand monoclonal antibody did not prevent a virus specific antibody response in non-human primates. 34 Another and perhaps more promising approach is based on generating a 'stealth virus', which is invisible to the immune system, by coating the virus capsid with polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEGylation of the virus capsid reduced cytotoxic T cells and antibody production and significantly prolonged transgene expression from 4 to 42 days. Repeated administration of the adenovirus modified with the same PEG was not successful, however, when different PEG formulations were used, significant transgene expression was detected after repeat administration. 36 Although, it has been demonstrated that repeated administration of liposome/DNA complexes to the nose of CF patients is possible, 3 there have been concerns raised regarding the inflammatory components of bacterial DNA. 2 The abundance of unmethylated CpG motifs in the bacterial plasmid DNA may at least in part be responsible for the inflammatory response. Several strategies are currently being explored to decrease these unwanted properties, such as (1) methylation of CpG sequences; (2) reduction of the CpG frequency by eliminating non-essential regions or by site-directed mutagenesis; and (3) the use of specific inhibitors of the CpG signalling pathway, such as chloroquine or quinacrine. 37 In summary, progress in enabling repeated administration of viruses has been rather slow and concerns regarding viral and non-viral GTA-induced inflammation have been raised. A more detailed understanding of the immune responses against viral and non-viral GTAs is therefore crucial for further improvements in gene transfer.",

Stem cell-based gene therapy approaches are also being investigated. Two strategies can be envisaged: either targeting lung-resident stem cells with integrating vectors or engineering bone marrow/embryonic cells ex vivo and inducing engraftment into the airway epithelium. Thus, bone marrow-derived stem cells have recently been observed to diferentiate into airway epithelial cells in the lung. 61 Prolonged and sustained CFTR expression may not be beneficial, especially if integrating vectors are used. To this end, epithelium-specific regulated cassettes are being developed. 62 Each of the vectors and technologies will have to be tested in relevant in vivo models. Ideally, in contrast to CF mice, these would reproduce the lung pathology seen in CF patients. For this reason efforts are being made to develop a CF ferret 63 and a CF sheep, 64 their lung biology being more similar to humans than the mouse. Finally new imaging techniques to monitor the efficiency of gene transfer in living animals/patients will also have to be developed.
