However, independently of the triggering event, ex vivo observations identified similar molecular footprints associated with the resolution of pathogenic processes (cancer, acute pathogen infection), tissue damage, or organ failure (allograft rejection, autoimmunity) suggesting that ''an immunological constant of rejection'' is required for immune-mediated tissue destruction. These footprints include interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and activation of innate immune effector functions (IEF). While ISGs appear to be necessary, but not sufficient, for induction of immunologically-mediated tissue destruction, IEF represent valuable biomarkers of terminal immunedifferentiation required for the elimination of unwanted tissues. A prototype example was recently described by Marincola's group studying the mechanisms leading to regression of basal cell carcinoma after treatment with the Toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod. In this blinded and randomized, placebo-controlled study, strong activation of IEF was seen, particularly in tumors treated with the optimized administration schedule. These observations reconcile the ambiguous role attributed to inflammation in cancer progression: chronic inflammation promotes tumor growth, while acute inflammation is required for cancer rejection.",

Immunoglobulin (Ig) gene somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch DNA recombination (CSR) are central to the maturation of antibodies and autoantibody-mediated responses. SHM and CSR are both affected by a two-step process: (i) DNA lesions initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), and (ii) lesion repair by the combined intervention of DNA replication and repair factors that include mismatch repair (MMR) proteins and translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) polymerases. AID and TLS polymerases that are crucial to SHM are induced in B cells by the triggering stimuli: B-cell receptor crosslinking and CD40 engagement by CD154. These polymerases, together with MMR proteins and other DNA replication and repair factors, could assemble to form a multimolecular complex ('mutasome') at the site of DNA lesions. Paolo Casali described these concepts within the context of existing in vivo and in vitro findings, and discussed an integrated mechanistic model of SHM and CSR.",

Because of the large number (>10 3 ) of allelic variants of human leukocyte antigens (HLA), immunoinformatics is used for prediction of new ligands that are naturally presented by any given HLA molecule. The combination of immunoinformatics and proteomics methods (e.g., mass spectrometry) is leading to characterization of ''ligandome'', that is a complete set of HLA ligands in a given individual, and application of this knowledge to the design of therapeutic vaccines against tumors. Prof. Rammensee described the ligandome study of the diverse HLA-B44 family (B*18, 37, 40, 41, 44, 45, 49, and 50) , and the definition of B44 supermotif having a glutamic acid or aspartic acid at position two and a hydrophobic amino acid at the C-terminus of the ligand. However, within several hundreds of HLA-B44 superfamily ligands, only 10 peptides were found to bind more than one HLA-B44 allele. The limitation of simple motifs for prediction of allele-or supertype-specific ligands has been demonstrated, and more sophisticated computational solutions are needed for the study of the diverse HLA families. The ultimate goal, i.e. the assembly of the near-complete ligandome through combination of sophisticated computational predictions and experimental validation, will be instrumental in prevention and therapy of major diseases-cancer, infectious disease, and autoimmunity.",

Conversion of raw genome sequence data into biological knowledge is, however, far from trivial, therefore predictions have to be subjected to stringent quality control. Dr. Patthy pointed out that the current percentage of incorrectly/incompletely predicted genes within the well-studied human genome is about 20% and the error rate is much higher for other genomes that are in earlier stages of annotation. The speaker illustrated with examples the key steps of his MisPred approach that weed out most of invalid and misleading predictions. For example, misannotation is detected when known subcellular localization of a predicted protein does not match the molecular addresses, e.g., if signal sequences are absent from extracellular proteins. Similarly, the MisPred programme will issue a warning, if a predicted protein contains abnormal domain combinations or contains domain(s) that show major deviation from the common size of that domainfamily. In summary, Dr. Patthy presented a clear case for the necessity for detection of gene mispredictions, whose extent is often underestimated. The ability of the MisPred strategy to spot abnormal or mispredicted proteins ensures its place in gene annotation as an efficient tool for quality control.",

Gene networks and systems biology in immunity (Chairpersons: Stephan Beck and Satoru Miyano) Symposium 1 comprised five plenary lectures addressing core aspects of systems biology, including genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics. Stephan Beck (Cambridge, UK) opened the symposium with a brief review of the growing field of immunogenomics and discussed recent advances of how different sets of genomic data can be combined into an integrated (epi)genetic approach to common disease, providing the missing link between genetics, disease and the environment. Chack Yung Yu (Ohio, USA) focused on the causes and consequences of copy number variation (CNV) in autoimmune disease. He presented a study that demonstrated CNV polymorphism of the complement components (C4A and C4B) contribution to the susceptibility of lupus erythematosus (SLE). Timothy Ravasi (La Jolla, USA) introduced the concept of network analysis and demonstrated its power in conjunction with experimental data such as cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) to infer transcriptional networks in macrophages during inflammatory immune responses. Bernhard Homey (D\u00fc sseldorf, Germany) reported lessons learnt from the global analysis of chemokines, a family of less than 50 proteins involved in the regulation of leukocyte trafficking. Atopic dermatitis and house dust-induced allergy are among the many clinically important phenotypes associated with chemokine-mediated immune responses. Laszlo Takacs (Debrecen, Hungary) discussed the potential of biomarkers as a tool to monitor drug efficacy in clinical trials. Using shotgun immunisation followed by antibodymediated proteomics, a plasma proteome-specific library of about 5000 monoclonal antibodies has been generated that can be expected to lead to the development of novel clinical assays. Satoru Miyano (Tokyo, Japan) presented an overview of computational approaches to systems biology. While global networks remain computationally intractable, less complex networks have been successfully applied to compute new drug targets. The development of Cell Illustrator, an interactive software to model and simulate cellular interactions, represents an important step towards enabling biomedical scientists to explore and harness the power of network analysis. The closing lecture was given by Suresh Jivan Gadher (Nyon, Switzerland) who described commercial solutions for biomarker discovery, including the ProteomeLab IgY partitioning system.",

The opening lecture of Sandor Pongor (Trieste, Italy) described the evolution of robust network topologies and gave an outline to the application of network models to biological systems. The quantitative modeling of the immune response was presented by Phil Hodgkin (Melbourne, Australia) who described an stochastic cellular calculus model and by Massimo Bernaschi (Rome, Italy) who presented the results of agent-based simulations. The data-driven approaches were presented by Francisca Sanchez-Jimenez (Malaga, Spain), who described a knowledge base integrating data and models on biogenic amines (av.bmbq.uma.es/asp), and by Shoba Raganathan (Sidney, Australia), who presented a structural immuno-informatics study of MHC-peptide complexes and its applications to autoimmune disorder Pemphigus vulgaris. Two short talks focussed on practical applications. Miriam Goldberg (Providence, USA) presented results on the use of bioinformatics tools for prediction of class II HLA-binding peptides in C3D, while Francesco Pappalardo (Catania, Italy) presented computational models for optimization of vaccine schedules.

            "text": "This session had six invited papers and three short presentations. The session covered a wide spectrum of research activities, ranging from computational modeling of various aspects of immune system, to exploiting immune system concepts for engineering applications; a very wide spectrum indeed. The first topic of the symposium was on exploiting immunological concepts as inspiration for engineering solutions (both software and hardware) (Jon Timmis, York, UK). Two such systems were presented in the symposium: one on tracking objects in a 3D virtual world (Gy\u00f6 rgy Cserey, Budapest, Hungary), and the other identifying failure in automated teller machines (Laszlo Prokai, Fort Worth, USA). However, it was also discussed that better interaction between the engineers and immunologists is needed to advance the range of applications. These interactions can be facilitated through the use of computational modeling (the other major topic of the symposium) for the study of immunological problems. A number of insightful presentations on the use of computational modeling to the study of various aspects of the immune system (Duccio Cavalieri, Florence, Italy). A computational model of cancer growth was developed and validated by experimental results (Santo Motta, Catania, Italy). Computational models allow researchers to ask questions that cannot be answered by pure experimental in vivo approach. Computational predictions were applied to the study of epitope-based vaccines (Natalia Tarnovitski Freund, Tel-Aviv, Israel). In this work T-cell epitopes were analysed by an algorithm to map the 80R epitope on a SARS coronavirus spike protein, and potential epitopes were identified as targets for vaccine design. Models of NK cell development and repertoire formation were presented (Ramit Mehr, Ramat-Gan, Israel). These models predicted that different repertoire developments will happen under different conditions, which as supported by experimental evidence (Hassan Tadjbakhsh, Tehran, Iran). A modeling approach was proposed for the analysis of information processing in the immune system through the ''language of short peptides''. It was elegantly shown that there is very little overlap between the set of unique self peptides and foreign peptides (Rob J. De Boer, Utrecht, Netherlands). This session emphasised a great deal of potential synergy from combination of studies of natural and artificial immunology.",

            "text": "Immunological databases and database tools represent the essential resources for the study of immune system. Nearly thirty databases focusing on various aspects of the immune system are cited in the NAR database listing (www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/cap/) and in the IMGT Immunoinformatics page (imgt.cines.fr). Historically, most immunological databases focused on the information related to genes and proteins of the immune system, immunoglobulins, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and immuno-polymorphisms. The integration of data from multiple sources and combination with the bioinformatic analysis tools enables automation of the analysis and knowledge discovery from databases. Vladimir Brusic (Brisbane, Australia) presented the basic concepts from data warehousing and data-mining for immunological discovery. The identification of genes and proteins of the immune system is difficult because of the complexity of immune interactions. Immune system products can be detected in genomic and proteomic studies of the immune system tissues, or using literature mining. Csaba Ortutay (Tampere, Finland) presented the database called Immunome, which contains sequence and annotation information on more than 500 genes and proteins involved in the immune function. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA -human MHC) genes show the largest variation of all human genes. A reference data set for eight HLA-homozygous typing haplotypes has been compiled and their annotations of their MHC class I region of the chromosome 6. Richard Gibson (Cambridge, UK) presented the MHC Haplotype Project for the study of disease loci within the MHC region. The IMGT/HLA database is centralised repository for Factors of the HLA System, as defined by the WHO HLA Nomenclature Committee and the Immune Polymorphism Databases (IPD) contain information on known polymorphic genes in the immune system. These two resources were presented by Steven Marsh (London, UK). A description of IMGT \u00d2 , the international ImMunoGeneTics information system \u00d2 , the reference in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics was presented by Marie-Paule Lefranc (Montpellier, France). IMGT \u00d2 standardization is based on IMGT-ONTOLOGY. IMGT \u00d2 comprises five databases, 15 analysis tools and more than 8,000 pages of Web resources for sequences, genetics, 2D (IMGT Colliers de Perles) and 3D structures of immunoglobulins (IG), T-cell receptors (TR), MHC and related proteins of the immune system (RPI) that belongs to the IgSF and MhcSF. Matthew Davies (Compton, UK) presented the database of B-cell and T-cell epitopes, AntiJen, and offered an insight into structural perspective of prediction of immune epitopes. Finally, Adriano Mari (Rome, Italy) presented Allergome database which integrates experimental, literature, and clinical data on allergens with analytical tools. Immunological databases and bioinformatic tools are necessary for efficient analysis of combinatorially-rich immunological data.",

The formidable challenges in this field still remain, including selection of adequate T-and B-cell epitope targets, vaccine formulation, elicitation of desired type of immune responses, delivery systems. Because of the enormous combinatorial complexity of vaccine development, so called ''intelligent vaccine design'' that combines immunoinformatics, molecular biology, genomics, and classic vaccinology. Nikolai Petrovsky (Adelaide, Australia) introduced the basic concepts and reviewed the current trends in the field. J. Thomas August (Baltimore, USA) presented work that combines immunoinformatic methods (prediction of T-cell epitopes, T-cell epitope hot-spots, analysis of viral diversity, and identification of conserved motifs) with LAMP-targeting DNA vaccines. Pre-clinical studies in transgenic mice or clinical trials have shown promising results in viral (HIV, influenza, and dengue) and cancer immunotherapies. Eszter Nagy (Vienna, Austria) introduced the concept of human pathogen antigenomes for the selection of vaccine candidates. This strategy utilizes full genome coverage and serological typing for identification of antigens from bacterial pathogens. The high-throughput in vitro validation relying on gene conservation, immunogenicity, extracellular localization and induction of functional antibodies helped identify novel highly conserved antigens in S. aureus, S. pheumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. agalactiae. Eva Rajnav\u00f6 lgyi (Debrecen, Hungary) discussed the use of dendritic cells (DC) as vaccine adjuvants in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. This work showed that DCs display subset-specific combinations of transmembrane and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors which determine involvement in diverse signaling pathways and transcriptional regulation. DC can be programmed by activation through synergistic signaling pathways to act as potent adjuvants. Camille Locht (Lille, France) presented a study on mechanisms of interactions between M. tuberculosis and non-professional phagocytes in latent infection. The heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA) is a major factor involved in extrapulmonary dissemination and establishment of latency. The HBHAcoated microbeads penetrate epithelial and endothelial cell layers and induce strong T-cell responses. Laszlo Radvanyi (Houston, USA) discussed tumor microenvironment factors which limit the success of T-cell-based therapies, including the role of immunosuppressive cytokines, activation of STAT3, T-regulatory cells, and defects in antigenpresenting cells. He discussed the utility of adoptive cell transfer therapy using tumor infiltrating lymphocytes using a number of experimental approaches. Hanna Rokita (Krakow, Poland) presented the work on development and testing of peptide-based vaccines for therapy of neuroblastoma. The strategy involves peptide mimetics of ganglioside GD2, pre-clinical studies in the mouse models, and the analysis of patient sera reactivity with GD2 and selected peptides. The members of Anne De Groot laboratory (Providence, USA) presented immunomics approaches to the development of vaccines for smallpox, tularemia, and H. pylori. These approaches involve combination computational screening of potential T-cell epitopes, binding assays, followed by experimental validation by ELISpot assays.",

            "text": "M. Zenke (Aachen, Germany) set the stage by the report on genomic approaches to dendritic cell (DC) biology. Emerging evidence suggests that DC develop from a population of Flt3+ progenitor cells via pathways different from the conventional pathways that produce lymphoid and myeloid cells. DCs are also being developed as vaccines and M. Zenke reported on ''smart'' contrast agents for monitoring DC location and function in vivo. A number of tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens have been used as targets for immuno anti-tumor therapy, including HER-2/neu. C.N. Baxevanis (Athens, Greece) reported ongoing studies aimed at overcoming tolerance to HER-2/ neu bearing tumors by (i) active immunization with HER-2/neu peptides, (ii) adoptive transfer of HER-2/neu specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), (iii) transfer of genetically modified CTLs that express HER-2/neu epitopes and (iv) targeting HER-2/neu by siRNA molecules. G. S\u00e1fr\u00e1ny (Budapest, Hungary) presented data on cytokine producing cancer vaccines in mouse glioma brain model combined with local radiotherapy. The immune reactions elicited in vivo were analyzed and it was found that vaccination induced the activation of CTLs and their depletion abolished the anti-tumor effect. J. Yoshida (Nagoya, Japan) reported a novel formulation of cationic liposomes containing the interferon (IFN)-b gene for therapy of human glioma. Preclinical studies demonstrated that the drug formulation is safe. In clinical studies the therapy involved surgery for tumor resection followed by stereotactic injection of the gene drug. Five patients received the treatment and the most prominent observed effect was the CTL activation.There is also considerable interest in the use of immuno-gene therapy to suppress unwanted immune responses, such as systemic auto-immune diseases. H. Oishi (Tsukuba, Japan) presented data on the use of tristetraprolin (TTP), a physiological regulator of TNF-a and GM-CSF production, in a transgenic model of MRL/lpr auto-immune prone mice. It was found that renal arteritis was significantly reduced in these mice, suggesting that TTP gene therapy is a potential modality for treatment of human auto-immune vasculitis. The design and engineering of immunoglobulin-expressing constructs and animals is a major focus of efforts to increase the efficiency and lower the cost of producing antibodies for prophylaxis and therapy. A variety of approaches to this problem were explored in this symposium. G. Hadlaczky (Szeged, Hungary) described the ACE system for monoclonal antibody production. This system has four elements: (i) a mammalian artificial chromosome with 20-50 acceptor sites for a targeting vector; (ii) a vector with the acceptor sites of the artificial chromosome and containing the gene/s to be expressed; (iii) an integrase that catalyzes the site-specific recombination of vector into acceptor sites and; (iv) a CHO cell line adapted to high density growth in serum-free medium as target for transaction by the artificial chromosome. This approach permits the generation of cell lines suitable for production of research quantities of a monoclonal antibody within two months. It was also possible to derive clonal lines expressing industry-relevant levels of antibody. Polyclonal human antibodies have a long history of use for the treatment of many different diseases. However because such antibodies are currently obtained from human donors, there are problems of supply, potency and standardization. To solve these problems, various technologies have been used to create genetically engineered animals that synthesize polyclonal human antibody. Two such models, one rabbit and the other bovine were described. I. Thorey (Bernried, Germany) reported the engineering of rabbits with a substitution of human V(D)J sequences for their rabbit equiva-lents in large tracts of the rabbit immunoglobulin heavy chain and kappa light chain loci. Rabbit promoters, enhancers and recombination signal sequences were unchanged. To obtain preferential expression of the human antibody repertoire, engineered animals were crossed with strains of rabbits with naturally occurring mutations that greatly impair the expression of rabbit immunoglobulin. The response of engineered rabbits to immunization with a defined antigen generated an antigen-specific human antibody response. R. Goldsby (Amherst, USA) described the generation of cloned cattle that are transchromosomic for a human artificial chromosome (HAC) that bears the entire human IgH and Ig light chain loci. Large numbers of human-Ig expressing HAC transchromsomal cattle have been produced. These animals synthesize fully human antibody and have a diversified repertoire of immunoglobulin. Immunization with a defined antigen induces the production of antigen-specific human polyclonal antibody. Furthermore, knockout technologies have been published that permit the derivation of cattle that cannot make bovine IgH and Ig, thereby allowing the generation of cattle that make human but not bovine antibody.",

Among the most successful immunotherapy treatment options is adoptive transfer of antigen specific T cells. The two critical barriers left to overcome that would make adoptive T cell transfer feasible. First, a source of autologous antigen specific cells needs to be readily available for any disease and all patients. Second, the function of adoptively transferred T cells must be retained in vivo. The first four lectures discussed the genetic modification of T cells to provide a source of autologous antigen specific T cells for any disease. Zelig Eshhar (Rehovot, Israel) presented his pioneering work with chimeric antibody receptors. These receptors utilize the antigen binding regions of monoclonal antibodies fused to signaling domains from CD3f or Fcc. Zelig Eshhar engineered T cells with these chimeric receptors which were then capable of recognizing tumor cells in vitro and in vivo in an MHC unrestricted fashion. Ralph Willemsen (Rotterdam, The Netherlands), Michael Nishimura (Chicago, USA), and Matthias Theobald (Mainz, Germany) each presented their work using native T cell receptor ab genes to genetically modify T cells. Drs. Willemsen and Nishimura described studies where the influence on the relative affinity of the introduced T cell receptor on target cell recognition was examined. While both described T cell receptors that had adequate affinity to engineer T cells to recognize tumors without the need for the CD8 coreceptor, Dr. Willemsen demonstrated that for most T cell receptors, co-expression of the CD8 a chain in CD8 negative cells can enhance the function of the genetically modified T cells. Dr. Nishimura focused on the crossreactivity of T cell receptor gene modified T cells and how they can be exploited to target mutant antigens.",

Enhancing the function of T cells was further discussed by Stanley Nathenson (Bronx, USA) and Kirsten Baken (Bilthoven, The Netherlands). Dr. Nathenson described his structure/function studies of the slam family of molecules which provided an insight into how to enhance T cell signaling and function. Dr. Baken presented the results of a study in which microarray analysis was used to examine the effects of the immunosuppressive biocide bis(tri-n-butyltin)oxide (TBTO) ('immunotoxicogenomics'). Gene expression profiling in thymus of mice after 3, 7, or 14 days of exposure showed that the TBTO-induced atrophy was most likely caused by inhibition of cell proliferation. Finally, Hsueh-Ting Chu (Taichung, Taiwan) described his studies to predict the best targets for immune therapy. His work would lead to vaccines that when combined with genetically altered T cells, could improve their function in vivo. In summary, this symposium provided an insight on how immunogenomics can alter T cell specificity and function to improve the quality of the immune response in patients with malignancies and virus infections.",

Is success of asthma therapy predictable by mapping haplotype complexity of the b 2adrenergic receptor, a target of bronchodilators? What are the current approaches to identify potent inhibitors of tissue lectins involved in immune diseases and tumor progression? What are the implications of ABC transporter proteins for chemoimmunity, an innate protective effector branch against toxic compounds? Will gene array technology help identify functional aberrations relevant for drug development in ankylosing spondylitis? How can extent of cytokine expression be improved in recombinant production? These were questions expertly addressed by the contributions to the symposium. Drawing on work with conditional mutants, Werner M\u00fc ller (Braunschweig, Germany) used interleukin-10 to teach the audience the salient lesson that the cellular origin of a cytokine matters markedly for the in vivo spectrum of effector functionality. Intriguingly, susceptibility to lipopolysaccharide is in part controlled by macrophage-derived interleukin-10, T-celldependent production of this protein which affects immune regulation in the gut playing no measurable role in this instance. Dissecting the in vivo cytokine network will thus require systematic study of conditional mutants. This also holds true for the emerging association of patients' haplotypes with clinical parameters in asthma. The way sequence variations of the b 2 -adrenergic receptor can help identify patients at high risk to suffer from complications was illuminated by Stephen P. Peters (Winston-Salem, USA). Adverse asthma outcomes were revealed during treatment with the short-acting b-agonist albuterol in patients homozygous for Arg at the receptor's position 16. It is therefore a matter of considerable interest to investigate further genotype variants with respect to clinical outcome. This work, and also protein characterization, is furthered by current technical advances summarized by Suresh Jivan Gadher (Nyon, Switzerland). Advances in drug development targeting immune effectors of the lectin families were reviewed by Hans-Joachim Gabius (Munich, Germany). The design of various types of chemical libraries with carbohydrate derivatives or amino acids, the latter to identify glycomimetic peptides, provides access to a fully randomized array of compounds for screening. Computer-assisted molecular modeling including flexible ligand docking and experiments to assess affinity improvements merge in an iterative refinement process to reach the optimal level of target specificity. Such a high level of specificity is deliberately avoided when looking at chemoimmunity, as outlined by Bal\u00e1zs Sarkadi (Budapest, Hungary). In fact, the three major transporters of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) protein family are currently known to expel around 1000 different compounds (xenobiotics) from cells to protect them from damage. It is an obvious challenge to define the molecular characteristics of this ''innate defense system''. The challenge to identify new targets for therapy in rheumatic diseases is presently met by testing chip technology. Peter Gergely Jr. (Budapest, Hungary) reported on his experience with RNA obtained from peripheral blood cells of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Dysregulation of gene expression, for example concerning vascular endothelial growth factor or fucosyltransferase-8, is warranted to be further followed. The last contribution to the symposium by Alireza Zamani (Hamedan, Iran) addressed a problem of gene expression not on the clinical level but in recombinant expression. Aiming at improving yields of c-interferon, a significant increase was reported by strictly controlling expression using the cumate-regulatable expression cassette.",

Doreen Cantreell (Dundee, UK) presented data on the role of serine kinases in lymphocytes. Serine is one of the most frequent modifications in T cells. One key signaling pathway effector is Protein Kinase D, which acts downstream of diacylglycerol and Protein Kinase C. PKD controls the subcellular localization of class II histone deacetylases providing a link between epigenetic control of transcription and antigen receptors.

They have successfully identified several proteins which might provide insight into the pathogenesis of this disease and also provide new therapeutic targets. Jaswinder Sethi (Cambridge, UK) used a genomic approach to identify genes regulated by TNF alpha signaling in mouse adipocytes devoid of TNF-R1, R2 or both. Using expression profiling they have identified such genes and found a link to ceramid signaling. J\u00e1nos S\u00fc megi (Cincinnatti, USA) has been studying a human condition Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (FHLH), which is a rare, autosomal recessive, life-threatening immune disorder, often referred to as an ''orphan'' disease. They have been systematically evaluating the contribution of perforin 1 to disease phenotype. They have identified perforin missense mutations with partial maturation (Class 1), no apparent proteolytic maturation (Class 2), and no recognizable forms of perforin (Class 3). L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nagy (Debrecen, Hungary) has been using genomic approaches including global gene expression profiling to identify the contribution of nuclear receptors to dendritic cell differentiation and function. They have linked now activation of the Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor gamma (PPARg) to increased retinoid production, signaling and CD1d expression. Their data suggest that the changing lipid environment causes fundamental changes in the gene expression pattern of dendritic cells including reprogramming of their lipid antigen presenting capacity. Finally, Marian L. Turner (Melbourne, Australia) gave a short talk on a new parameter in T cell proliferation. They have found striking differences between the numbers of cell division and the various signals inducing it. Constant stimulation of B cells with lipopolysaccharide or anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody and IL-4 resulted in more than 8 cycles of cell division, while B cells stimulated with CpG DNA underwent 4-5 divisions.",

Maryam Farzad (Santa Clara, USA) applied spectral karyotyping (SKY), array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), microarray gene expression analysis and various software tools to profile the differences between ovary carcinoma cells sensitive or resistant to cisplatin, and to identify gene networks. Her presentation was a clear illustration of the need for and the power of combined oncogenomic approaches in the analysis of complex tumor phenotypes like drug resistance. Ondrej Hrusak (Prague, Czech Republic) reviewed the status of gene expression profiling in leukemias, in particular for what concerns the impact on diagnostics, and presented data on the differentiation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia based on the expression of CD27 and CD44. He concluded that genomics provides great discovery tools which should not replace, but rather complement conventional diagnostic technologies. J\u00f3 zsef T\u00ed m\u00e1r (Budapest, Hungary) presented two interesting cases of functional studies set in motion by microarray findings. Melanomas were unexpectedly found to express the ryanodine receptor 2, however the receptor did not appear to be functional; hence it could have chiefly a diagnostic significance. He then showed that the analysis of melanoma xenotransplants reveals a metastasis-related signature and yields a wide set of new targets that can be exploited by drug therapy and by biotherapy. Mepur H. Ravindranath (Santa Monica, USA) reviewed tumor gangliosides from the vantage point of his great experience in this field. In particular he showed that shedding gangliosides favors tumor growth and progression by depressing the antitumor immune response. Significant antiganglioside IgM titers are detectable in various types of human cancer, like prostate and ovarian carcinoma and melanoma, and correlate with disease stage, thus representing a potential biomarker of tumor progression. Barbara Seliger (Halle, Germany) first gave a concise and comprehensive overview of the various ''omics'' dealing with the analysis of spontaneous and induced immune responses against tumors. She then presented data on the immunoproteomic analysis of tumor antigens and antitumor immune responses induced by renal cell carcinoma transduced with costimulatory molecules B7.1 and B7.2. The direct identification of proteins with mass spectrometry could provide not only useful insights in T cell activation, but also potential targets for new therapies aimed at modulating T cell activation. Pier-Luigi Lollini (Bologna, Italy) reviewed the concept of cancer immunoprevention, i.e. the use of prophylactic vaccines to prevent tumor onset in individuals at risk. He showed that a vaccine combining three immune signals (the target antigen, allogeneic MHC and interleukin 12) completely prevented the aggressive mammary carcinoma of HER-2/neu transgenic mice by inducing helper T cell cytokines (mainly gamma-interferon) and anti-HER-2 antibodies. Finally, Chia-Chung Hou (Taipei, Taiwan) showed that a galactolipid (CRE-7) from a plant used in Taiwanese folk medicine has immunomodulatory and chemopreventive activities, and Senthamil R. Selvan (Newport Beach, USA) demonstrated the potential of simultaneously measuring various blood cytokines and T cell markers for the immunomonitoring of cancer patients undergoing vaccine therapy.",

            "text": "Steffen Gay (Zurich, Switzerland) introduced currently used therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with the conclusion that, despite the novel strategies (e.g. anti-TNFa therapies), so far, we are yet unable to cure the disease. His presentation focused on how the synovial fibroblasts (SF) of RA patients can be intrinsically activated and, due to the expression of Toll-like receptors TLR-2, -3 and -4, RA-SF respond to TLR-ligands. These cells produce potent inflammatory chemokines, including GCP-2, MCP-2 and Rantes, thus attracting immune cells into the affected joints. Tibor T. Glant (Chicago, USA) presented how animal models of RA can be used for the discovery of disease (RA) responsible genes, and how the various methods (genome screening, DNA and protein microarrays, different congenic and gene-manipulated animal strains) can be combined and applied to diagnosis and treatment; and what factors of these methods limit to achieve early diagnosis and successful therapeutic application for polygenic autoimmune diseases. Alison Finnegan's (Chicago, USA) presentation focused upon the role of B cells and antibodies (in addition to T cells) in the pathogenesis of RA and RA-related animal models. As the most recent studies demonstrated a significant improvement in clinical symptoms in patients treated with Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that depletes pro-B cells and mature B cells but not plasma cells, she concluded that autoreactive T cells could synergize with autoantibodies for the induction and severity of arthritic processes. Because both autoreactive T cells and autoantibodies are required for arthritis induction, B cell-mediated effector pathways should synergistically contribute to autoimmune disease. Alteration of lymphocyte signaling thresholds, together with other factors, may contribute to the disruption of self-tolerance in systemic autoimmunity. Nikolai Petrovsky (Adelaide, Australia) questioned whether some dogmas have crept into autoimmunity research to put researchers off track and hinder development of cures. Potential dogmas might include such ideas as autoimmunity being a state of immune hyper-function, T cell auto-reactivity not being a feature of healthy individuals, autoimmune diabetes is a Th1 (interferon gamma dependent) condition, or diabetes-related HLA molecules are better at presenting diabetogenic self-peptides. He concluded that most data would suggest that each of these dogmas is in fact the opposite of the truth and thus: (1) autoimmunity is more likely to be a state of immune hypo-function, (2) T cell auto-reactivity is a common feature of non-autoimmune prone individuals, (3) interferon gamma plays an important role in autoimmunity protection, and (4) diabetes-related HLA molecules are defective rather than more efficient at presenting diabetogenic self-peptides. Milan Buc (Bratislava, Slovakia) presented data indicating that similar HLA alleles were associated with type 1 diabetes in the Slovak population as have been observed elsewhere. Moncef Zouali (Paris, France) outlined the evolving concepts and potential pathologic mechanisms underlying systemic lupus erythematosus. He discussed that alterations in lymphocyte receptor signaling may result in the persistence of high-affinity self-reactive lymphocytes and thereby, together with other factors, may contribute to the disruption of self-tolerance in systemic lupus erythematosus.",

Matyas Sandor (Madison, USA) expressed epitope tagged molecules at different mycobacterial location. His data indicate that antigens located in mycobacterial cytoplasm induce T cell immunity only if they are expressed at high level, suggesting an evasion mechanism by which a large part of mycobacterial proteome is not seen by host immunity. Joann Flynn (Pittsburgh, USA) discussed the role of TNF in controlling granuloma and the reactivation of Mtb with anti-TNF therapy. She also discussed a monkey model of Mtb.

Plant allergens belong to only a few of the 8957 protein families defined by the Pfam database version 21.0 (www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/). Sequences of 150 plant food and 157 pollen allergens (www.allergome.org) could be allocated to 31 and 29 Pfam families, respectively. The four most abundant plant food allergen families -prolamins, cupins, profilins, and Bet v 1 homologues -contain 65% of all plant food allergens. The eleven most prominent pollen allergen families contain 82% of all pollen allergens, expansins, profilins, and calcium-binding proteins representing the major ones. Members of protein families with conserved structures such as Bet v 1 homologues, profilins, or polcalcins are highly cross-reactive even when originating from taxonomically unrelated plants. Adriano Mari (Rome, Italy) the founder and administrator of the Allergome database gave an overview of currently available allergen databases on the web discussing the pros and cons of each of them. Daniel Soeria-Atmadja (Uppsala, Sweden), presented a new motif-based prediction system (DFLAP) and a web-based server for the risk assessment of potentially allergenic proteins. Kenji Izuhara (Saga, Japan) reported their search for novel asthma related genes by microarray studies. They identified the POSTN gene encoding periostin as an IL-4/IL-13-inducible gene in bronchial epithelial cells. Periostin is thought to be an adhesion molecule because it possesses four fasciclin I domains, characteristic of a family of adhesion molecules. Csaba Szalai (Budapest, Hungary) summarized their studies on the role of gene-environmental interaction in asthma. Children infected with Chlamydophila pneumoniae carrying the TNFa-3 8A allele were found to have a high risk of developing asthma. They have found an association between CCR5D32 and chronic Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infection and according to their results carrying defective CCR5 receptor might reduce the susceptibility to asthma in MP infected children comparing them to children with similar infection status, but carrying only wild type CCR5. Rob Leurs (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) talked about the characteristics of the novel histamine H 4 receptor and their initial in vivo experiments with H4 receptor antagonists which suggest a role for the H4 receptor in inflammatory conditions. Andor Pivarcsi (Stockholm, Sweden) presented a study about CCL18 and its association with an atopy/allergy skin phenotype.

In the introductory talk, Ivan Lefkovits (Basel, Switzerland) highlighted the importance of combining transcriptomic and proteomic approaches in gene expression studies. Only the combination of the two can avoid potential pitfalls present when the techniques are used as standalone. Moving from a more general conceptual framework to a successfully applied example of integrated functional genomics, Clemens Dahinden (Bern, Switzerland) showed how such a combined approach identified two novel potential mediators of allergy from basophils, Granzyme B and retinoic acid. Both mediators are released when basophils are exposed to supernatants of mast cells which have been activated by IgE-receptor crosslinking. Andr\u00e1s Falus (Budapest, Hungary) showed that cord blood-derived mast cells treated with TGF-b1 displayed changes in expression of 45 genes, the most prominent being the up-regulation of TIM-3 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3) and the down-regulation of growth differentiation factor (GDF-15). He then went on to discuss how mast cell-derived TIM-3 may support the growth of melanoma or other tumors. Peter Valent (Vienna, Austria) presented potential new targets for the therapy of mast cell leukemia identified by genomic and high throughput screening technologies. Israel Pecht (Rehovot, Israel) using the rat muco-sal-type mast cells RBL-2H3, showed how desensitization (obtained by excessive, prolonged or repetitive exposure to a stimulus), can regulate FceRI-mediated signaling by inducing two different types of regulatory processes (i) protein degradation via ubiquitin-proteasome route and (ii) attenuation of positive signaling by recruitment of negative control molecules (e.g., SHIP-1, Gab2). Franco Falcone (Nottingham, United Kingdom) presented a pilot study aimed at developing a new technology which combines allergens on a protein microarray chip with living purified basophils which can be applied to the diagnosis of Type I IgE-mediated allergy, e.g., to food allergens or pollen. The assay couples the diversity and power of the protein array, with the sensitivity of the basophils, adding a new biological dimension to the test. Tamsyn Crowley (Geelong, Australia) studies the effect of chicken aneamia virus (CAV) in poultry. CAV is a virus that causes immunosuppression in the host and is an important economical factor in broiler flocks. The study presented first data from whole genome chicken microarrays showing responses to infection at different time points. The session came to a close with a presentation by John Hunt (Sidney, Australia), who looked at the effects of IL-15 on the gene expression of mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (mBMMCs). Treatment with IL-15 induces changes in expression of genes secreted into the extracellular space, such as MMP-9 and ApoC1, genes with known roles in inflammation.",

            "text": "A number of new results and therapeutic approaches were presented at the Symposium on Neuro-immunogenomics, clustering around the molecular background and predictive therapy of neuroinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. A central role of inflammation in the development of CNS diseases were presented by suggesting common cellular targets of epilepsy and LPS induced inflammation reaction in the thalamo-cortical system (G\u00e1bor Juh\u00e1sz, Budapest, Hungary). The role of dendritic cell targeting and infectious immunomodulation was discussed as potential novel therapeutics in inflammatory CNS diseases (Zsuzsa Fabry, Madison, USA). It was demonstrated that dendritic cells can migrate from brain to cervical lymph nodes, initiate antigen specific T cell activation and homing to the CNS. These activated antigen-specific T cells accumulate in the CNS at both cognate antigen containing and traumatic injury sites and they contribute of antigen deposition, CNS infection and traumatic injury in the brain. A novel concept was also presented, on the stimulus-dependency of immunomodulation. Adverse immunomodulatory effect of b-adrenergic receptor was demonstrated on inflammatory mediator production that was accompanied by parallel changes in activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs (Judit Szel\u00e9nyi, Budapest, Hungary). This recognition offers a new perspective in further drug developments for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (Sergio Baranzini, San Francisco, USA). Two new antigen-specific approaches were presented, which are suitable for the study and treatment of myasthenia gravis (Socrates Tzartos, Athens, Greece). The first approach is based on the fact that Fab fragments of anti-AChR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are not pathogenic, but can protect AChRs against the pathogenic activity of intact MG antibodies. The second approach selectively depletes patient's plasma from the anti-AChR autoantibodies, through the construction of ''immunoadsorbent'' columns carrying recombinant AChR fragments. In another known autoimmune disease multiples sclerosis (MS), different strategies for predictive modeling of the response of patients to immunomodulatory drugs were also demonstrated (Paolo Riccio, Potenza, Italy). These methods include advanced statistics, transcriptional network analysis, and reverse engineering. Three strategies are currently used to approach the MS problem: (1) Modulating expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases; (2) Choosing an appropriate diet capable of influencing the progression of the disease; (3) Developing new carrier systems for the targeted delivery of therapeutical agents to sites of inflammation at the blood brain barrier.",

Coussens, East Lansing, USA, Jerry W. Simecka, Fort Worth, USA) and human diseases. Taking an optimistic genomic view onto the area it may be concluded that high-throughput methods and microarray platforms will certainly help delineate and described basic routes and mechanisms in inflammation. However it is also very important to take into account that current data analysis and interpretation methods are underdeveloped and cannot fully elucidate the complexity and causality in this fundamental biologic field (Zolt\u00e1n Proh\u00e1szka, Budapest, Hungary). Cliona O'Farrelly (Dublin, Ireland) presented important insights into the comparative genomic analysis of innate immune receptors. Innate immunity is the primary line of active defense against invading pathogens in vertebrates and invertebrates and is initiated by recognition of conserved structural motifs uniquely expressed by microbes. The lecture of Endre Kiss-Toth (Sheffield,UK) presented new data on the intracellular signaling via TLRs contributing to improved understanding of the concept of innate sensing. Peter Garred (Copenhagen, Denmark) focused his talk also on aspects of innate immunity by summarizing their recent results on new molecule family called ficolins. An important technical note was made by Michael W. Pfaffl (Freising-Weihenstephan, Germany) on recent advances in quantitative real-time PCR, and two other presentations focused on infection related inflammation. Stephan Beck and Elizabeth A. Hart (Cambridge, UK) summarized the complete genetic and epigenetic haplotype maps of the human MHC region. Authors set out to characterize the linkage disequilibrium patterns between the highly polymorphic HLA genes and background variation by typing the classical HLA genes and >7500 common SNPs and deletion-insertion polymorphisms across four population samples. The analysis provided informative tag SNPs that captured much of the common variation in the MHC region and that could be used in disease association studies, and it provides new insight into the evolutionary dynamics and ancestral origins of the HLA loci and their haplotypes.",

The creation of large specimen collections along with data stored lead to the development of large biobanks. This process creates new opportunities, but also raises new questions requiring appropriate actions. The tutorial session at the BCII'06 provided an excellent overview of the question of biobanks and presented contemporary approaches enabling the efficient and adequate use of biobank-data in genomic research. Martin Yuille (Manchester, UK) presented the breakthrough initiative of the UK DNA Banking Network that started the collation of genetic materials from 13 collections in different disease areas (www.dna-network.ac.uk). As a result of their work, now there is an opportunity for interested applicants to work with purified DNA specimens with standardized quality and with known clinical background. Unfortunately, the starting of a biobank is not always easy. Some thoughts about the rise and fall of biobanks were delineated by Bela Melegh (P\u00e9cs, Hungary). Barna Vasarhelyi (Budapest, Hungary) described Hungarian efforts that aim to register current specimen collections at the homepage (www.biobank.hu). Its goal is to support the creation of connections between individual research groups. A more specific homepage and common on-line register focusing on clinical and genomic data obtained from Hungarian patients with neuro-psychiatric disorders will be created in a few months: details are provided in a special article of Judit Maria Molnar (Budapest, Hungary) in this issue. Biobanks also raise ethical questions; Judit Sandor (Budapest, Hungary) gave an excellent overview of the ''tissue-issues''. In the afternoon session some excellent examples of the practical application of the collected information were introduced. The analysis of information requires a new way of integration of genomics and functional data, as Vladimir Brusic (Brisbane, Australia) noted. The data obtained during clinical and experimental work should be synthesized, integrated and analyzed. Data-mining tools are increasingly used during the last phase and, will hopefully; provide an opportunity to find links between disease and genomics. Four lectures at the tutorial focused on special topics where bioinformatics that include genomic data are extensively used. Soren Brunak (Lyngby, Denmark) presented machine learning approaches for epitope prediction. Werner M\u00fcller (Braunschweig, Germany) lectured on the use of",

The use of databases in glycoimmune research is also dynamically progressing; Edit Buz\u00e1s (Budapest, Hungary) devoted her lecture to the discussion of current trends in biobanking. Finally, Francisca Sanchez-Jimenez (Malaga, Spain) reported initial results of a pilot project on data mining and integration in the biogenic amine field.Tutorial 2. Bioinformatics for autoimmunity (Chairpersons: Nikolai Petrovsky and Paolo Riccio) The successful tutorial bioinformatics for autoimmunity, organised by Vladimir Brusic (Brisbane, Australia) Marie-Paule Lefranc (Montpellier, France) and Paolo Riccio (Potenza, Italy) on behalf of the MARIE Network of the European Science Foundation (ESF) and the European ImmunoGrid Project, provided an excellent opportunity for research immunologists and students to get hands-on experience with a range of essential online bioinformatic tools and resources covering database searching, sequence comparison, text mining, data warehousing, prediction of T-cell epitopes, analysis of immunoglobulins and 3-D modeling. Shoba Ranganathan (Sydney, Australia) gave an introduction to tools for predicting autoantigens using structural bioinformatics and 3D modillion; Marie-Paule Lefranc, (Montpellier, France) introduced the IMGT \u00d2 information system (imgt.cines.fr) for the standardized analysis of immunoglobulin, T cell receptor and MHC sequences; Vladimir Brusic (Brisbane, Australia) discussed on-line tools including neural network models for prediction of T-cell epitopes; Nikolai Petrovsky (Adelaide, Australia) provided an overview of how bioinformatic tools including artificial neural networks could be applied to autoimmune disease research with particular focus on type 1 diabetes mellitus; Sergio Baranzini (San Francisco, USA) demonstrated network modeling approaches as applied to study of experimental demyelinating diseases; Santo Motta (Catania, Italy) reported on Immune System Modeling, and Christian Schoenbach (Singapore) gave a lecture on Genomics and Post-genomics of the immune system. Throughout the workshop all participants had on-line computer access and were encouraged to explore and trial the bioinformatic tools and resources overviewed by the presenters.Tutorial-3 From microarray design to image processing and data analysis -open tools from agilent technologies (Chairperson: Istvan Rasko)Ruth Finch (Waldbronn, Germany) gave a detailed presentation on Agilent Technologies free web-based tool for setting up custom microarrays. The software called eArray is suitable for choosing and selecting Agilent validated oligos, design probes de novo, upload customer validated probes of any species for a range of microarray applications. After choosing the right array format, ordering is processed through a secure web environment to manufacturing. In the second part of the tutorial, the GeneSpring GX bioinformatics tool was introduced by Mikaela Gabrielli (Paris, France). The GeneSpring GX features such as statistical analysis, biological interpretation, visualisation tools, hypothesis testing, pathway discovery could be followed using real microarray expression data.Technical workshop on microarray and miRNA platforms (Invitrogen, CSERTEX Ltd.)The first lecture was given by Jakub Razga (Distributor Manager, Central and Eastern Europe, Invitrogen), who summarized several new products of Invitrogen regarding the sample processing for microarray analysis. Invitrogen introduced several kits to obtain high-purity, long-transcript RNA, like Trizol \u00d2 Plus RNA purification System or the ChargeSwitch \u00d2 Total RNA Cell kit. With other related kits the amount of starting materials can be increased, and the various labeling kits enable researches to choose according their application and preference. Isabelle Salvignol (Technical Sales Specialist Gene Expression Profiling, Invitrogen) presented the NCode\u00e4 miRNA Analysis Platform, which has been optimized to purify, amplify, label, detect on a miRNA microarray and quantify miRNA expression, enabling simple and efficient profiling of miRNA expression patterns in various types of tissue, disease, and developmental states, providing insight into their role in gene regulation. Purelink\u00e4 miRNA Isolation Kit is designed to purify small RNA molecules (<200 nt), such as microRNA (miRNA) and short interfering RNA (siRNA). The NCode\u00e4 miRNA Amplification System is a robust linear miRNA amplification system that employs modifications to previously documented mRNA amplification methods, enabling efficient amplification and microarray profiling of smaller RNA species such as miRNA from as little as 200 ng of total RNA or the enriched equivalent. The NCode\u00e4 miRNA Labeling System is a fast and reproducible labeling system containing all the necessary components to directly label endogenous miRNAs with fluorescent tags. The Ncode\u00e4 Multi-Species miRNA Microarray contains probes for profiling miRNAs from a variety of species, allowing researchers to comprehensively screen most known miRNA molecules for the most studied species.Satellite: European inaugural of the international postgenetics society (Chairpersons: Malcolm Simons and Andras Pellionisz)International PostGenetics Society (IPGS, www.post geneticcs.org) now with 44 Founders and members from 33 countries was established in 2005, a Century after Bateson coined the term Genetics, to give priority by an International Organization to inquiry beyond protein-coding genes, by formally abandoning ''Junk'' DNA. At its first ''European Inaugural'' as a Satellite to BCII'06 on October 12, 2006 in Budapest, Hungary, IPGS asserted that Genetics had moved beyond Genes, opening the gateway towards unraveling diseases beyond the gene definition as priority by regional funding agencies. This paradigm shift affects information technology, nanotechnology and above all ''PostGenetic Medicine''. Malcolm J. Simons (Melbourne, Australia) a pioneer in the field, pointed out in 1987 that",
