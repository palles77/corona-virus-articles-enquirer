            "text": "Nucleic acid (NA)-targeted tests detect and quantify viral DNA and RNA (collectively xNA) to support epidemiological surveillance and, in individual patients, to guide therapy. They commonly use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR. Although these all have rapid turnaround, they are expensive to run. Multiplexing would allow their cost to be spread over multiple targets, but often only with lower sensitivity and accuracy, noise, false positives, and false negatives; these arise by interactions between the multiple nucleic acid primers and probes in a multiplexed kit. Here we offer a multiplexed assay for a panel of respiratory viruses that mitigates these problems by combining several nucleic acid analogs from the emerging field of synthetic biology: (i) self-avoiding molecular recognition systems (SAMRSs), which facilitate multiplexing, and (ii) artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGISs), which enable low-noise PCR. These are supplemented by \"transliteration\" technology, which converts standard nucleotides in a target to AEGIS nucleotides in a product, improving hybridization. The combination supports a multiplexed Luminex-based respiratory panel that potentially differentiates influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, detecting as few as 10 MERS virions in a 20-ml sample.",

Almost immediately, these artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGISs) were adapted for use in diagnostics assays. These exploited the ability of AEGIS DNA to pair with AEGIS DNA without off-target hybridization to the standard nucleic acids, which are always abundant in real biological samples. Best known of these are the branched DNA assays that used two matched AEGIS components, IsoC and IsoG, in a signaling dendrimer to measure viral loads in patients infected with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C [2, 3] . These products received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2004 and were used to personalize the care of some 400,000 patients per year before the product was retired in 2014.",

This required those tools to add isoGTP opposite isoC in a template and not the reverse; if isoG were in the template, T would be misincorporated opposite isoG a substantial fraction of the time.

The reason for this was unfavorable conditions for RSV RTePCR. This cross-reactivity appeared to arise from the fact that optimal conditions to amplify the MERS targets were suboptimal for discriminating between RSV and InfA (Fig. 3C) . To resolve this problem, two groups of RTePCR incubations were done in parallel, each under its optimal conditions.

The enzymes were inactivated by heating at 80 C (20 min). The treated PCR products (3 ml) were then added directly to the RPER. Briefly, an RPER (20 ml) was done in 1 \u00c2 ThermoPol Buffer (20 mM TriseHCl, 10 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO 4 , and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.8) at 25 C (NEB) with 5 0 -biotinylated external (common) reverse AEGIS primer (0.2 mM), and Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase (1 U per reaction; NEB). To perform extension without transliteration, dNTPs (final 0.2 mM each) were added. To incorporate dZ into the final amplicon with transliteration (where Z replaces C due to primer extension with mismatching of dZTP opposite template G), nucleoside triphosphates (dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dZTP, final concentration 0.2 mM each) were added without dCTP. Both were incubated in DNA Engine Multi-Bay Thermal Cyclers (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at 95 C (1 min), followed by 20 cycles (94 C for 20 s, 55 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 30 s) with a final incubation cycle at 72 C (1 min). Reaction mixtures were then quenched with 4 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Probe coupling to Luminex MicroPlex carboxylated microspheres Capture probes modified with an amino-C12 linker at the 5 0 end were coupled to Luminex MicroPlex carboxylated microspheres (\"beads\") (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA) by a carbodiimide-based procedure according to the manufacturer's protocol. For each combination of probe and bead set, 2.5 million Luminex beads were resuspended in 0.1 M Mes buffer (morpholinium ethanesulfonate, 50 ml, pH 4.5, SigmaeAldrich), with probe (4 ml of 0.1 mM stock to give 0.4 nM final concentration), and treated twice with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC; 5 ml of a 10-mg/ml solution, Thermo Scientific/Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA; room temperature, 30 min), rinsed in Tween 20 (0.02% aq. solution), and then rinsed with a sodium dodecyl sulfate solution (0.1%) and resuspended in TriseEDTA buffer (pH 8.0) to give a final volume of 100 ml.",
