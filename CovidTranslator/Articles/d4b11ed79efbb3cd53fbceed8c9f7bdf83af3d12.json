The flow near and behind HCW is easily affected by HCW motion. The flow disturbance induced by HCW walking with swinging arms and legs is a mixing process. The walking HCW displaces air in front of it and carries air in the wake forwardly, meanwhile pressure difference drives air from two lateral sides into the wake. HCW motion (0e5.4 s) indeed induces a little gaseous dispersion, but the residual flow disturbance after HCW stops (5.4 se25.4 s) induces more gaseous agent spread and it requires more than 30e60 s to approximately recover to the initial state after HCW stops.",

No matter with or without HCW motion, the ceiling-level exhausts perform much better in controlling airborne transmission than the floor-level exhausts with the same air change rate (12.9 ACH). Smaller air change rate of 6 ACH experiences higher concentration and more gaseous spread than 12.9 ACH. In contrast to the realistic human walking, the simplified motion of a rectangular block produces stronger flow disturbance. Finally surface heating of HCW produces a stronger thermal body plume and enhances turbulence near HCW, thus slightly strengthens airborne transmission.",

[14] and Yin et al. [19] found that the displacement ventilation may or may not provide a better performance of removing tracer gas and/or fine particles in the breathing zone depending on the location of the exhaust. Previous investigations on mixing ventilations in hospital isolation rooms [17, 18] suggested that, if the upward thermal body plumes are considered in an isolation room with downward supply air streams, the ceiling-level exhausts are more efficient than the floor-level exhausts in reducing airborne transmissions.

However full-scale experimental investigations of how human movements affect dynamic airflows and airborne transmission are difficult and high-quality experimental data with meaningful temporal and spatial resolution are rare so far [23e27] . The application of dynamic mesh technique combined with CFD simulations provides a promising tool for such investigations [26e34]. Poussou et al. [27] and Mazumdar et al. [28] carried out small-scale experiments and CFD simulations to study the impact of human movement on airborne transmission in airliner cabins, finding that the human-induced wake may carry contaminant to positions far from the source location. Choi and Edward [29, 30] performed large eddy simulations to explore how realistic human walking affects indoor airflows and contaminant transport between two rooms through a door way and the shared hall or vestibule. They first found that [29] the human wake may transport material over a distance of 8 m when there is no ventilation system. The walking speed and the initial proximity of human from the doorway may affect the human-induced room-to-room contaminant transport. Then they reported that [30] , with ventilation systems, human-induced wake motion did enhance compartment-tocompartment contaminant transport.",

            "text": "Reported nosocomial SARS outbreaks in hospital wards worldwide have reminded us that it requires to create a safe and healthy environment in hospital wards, i.e. protect HCWs and uninfected patients from the risk of infection during an outbreak of airborne or droplet-borne diseases. In hospital isolation rooms, there are usually mechanical ventilation systems with air change rates of higher than 4e6 ACH, which are higher than general mechanicallyventilated indoor environments. Thus the effect of HCW motion on dynamic airflow and airborne transmission in hospital isolation rooms possibly differs from other kinds of rooms and requires more special concern. Previous studies usually used a sharp-edged rectangular block to model a moving HCW in an one-bed isolation room [31e33]. The use of rectangular blocks possibly over-predicts the dynamic flow disturbance induced by HCW motion, considering that a realistic walking HCW is a moving blunt object with human profile [35] and swinging legs, moreover there is leakage between torso and arms as well as between two legs [29, 30] . Shih et al. [31] found that although the velocity and pressure fields in an one-bed isolation room are easily affected by a moving person, however the moving body does not obviously affect the removal of gaseous contaminants. Mazumdar et al. [32] verified that the wake of moving objects can carry gaseous contaminants inducing a swing in the contaminant concentration at the breathing levels for 10e 90 s, but the risk level in the ward change little with and without the movements. Wang and Chow [33] numerically investigated the effect of human walking on dispersion and deposition of expiratory particles (0.5e20 mm) in an one-bed isolation room, finding that HCW motion significantly affects the particles dispersion and depositions. The faster HCW motion, the less suspended particles in the isolation room. The findings of Wang and Chow [33] differ from the other two [31, 32] . The possible reason is that, in Wang and Chow [33] , the boundary conditions at all wall surfaces (i.e. including moving object) for particles is 'trap' condition with 'deposition effect', and particles may deposit onto HCW surfaces as it moves backwards and forwards, however for gaseous contaminants there is no deposition [31, 32] . In addition, some literature treated the patient as the only heat source [31, 33] , and some considered the heat flux from HCW surface [32] . Further investigations are still required to investigate the difference between these two situations. Finally, apart from human movement, the influence of other transient events in enclosed indoor environments has also been investigated, such as changing of sheets on a patient's bed [32] , the motion of door opening and closing [4,29e 31,36e38] .",

[39] ), the swinging motion of both legs and arms is controlled by a temporal profile. If the normalized walking cycle events are mapped on the interval [0, 1] and the associated phase variable f denotes the progression in the cycle, almost all the walking cycle events have a constant phase value whatever the walking velocity is [39] . Here f \u00bc ft \u00bc t/T (f is the walking frequency, T is the cycle duration (s)). For the total hip flexion amplitude Dhip (see Fig. 1a ), Ronan et al. [39] suggested a choice of hip max \u00bc \u00c02 hip min which is consistent with values observed in the natural walking pattern. Here in our CFD simulations (see Figs. 1a and 2b), H \u00bc 0.68 m is the leg length for the walking HCW model. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1b , the acceleration or deceleration of moving speed is linear as a function of f or time t (s) during human walking. We also assume that a HCW would walk softly with an average speed of 0.89 m/s (or 2 mph) according to the classification of Ainsworth et al. [40] , and the key parameters include the frequency f \u00bc 0.74 Hz (or T \u00bc 1.35 s), the total hip flexion amplitude Dhip \u00bc 38.9 , the maximum walking velocity V 0 \u00bc 1.09 m/s and the minimum walking velocity V min \u00bc 0.11 m/s. The arms can be swinging or not swinging depending on the activity pattern (for example, carrying something using two hands). Here we assume that arms also swing in the opposite phase of legs (i.e. the left arm swings similarly to the right leg).",

The grid size for the surface of lying thermal manikins (see Fig. 2b ) is from 0.5 cm to 5 cm for which the finest near mouth, fine near the head and relatively coarse near torso surface. The grid size at HCW surfaces is 2 cm, and the maximum grid size at wall surfaces is 10 cm. The total number of tetrahedral cells is about 0.9 million.

One assumes that HCW model only stays near the source manikin (Patient 6) for a short moment (much less than 5 min) and there is no heat flux from the HCW surface. The other supposes that HCW model has been staying there for sufficiently long time (for example w10 min), and the surface heat flux (57.5 Watt/m 2 ) of HCW model should be considered.",

Yin et al. [19] experimentally verified the distributions of gaseous contaminant and fine particles (1 and 3 mm) looked the same. Thus ventilation rates and airflow patterns are important to transmit and remove gaseous agents and exhaled fine particles. In addition, a long period of human walking forwards and backwards [31e33] possibly produce more flow disturbance. For example, Mazumda et al. [32] found that, if the body moves for 3 s and then stops, or it moves backwards and forwards in an one-bed isolation room with 4-ACH displacement ventilation system, the swing of gaseous concentration field will disappear in less than 60 s or in 90 s respectively. As the first step, this paper only considers tracer gas simulation without moving backwards and forwards. CFD simulations of particles and droplets with different sizes will be included in the second paper. Five test cases were numerically investigated, as shown in Table 2 . In Case 1 and Case 2, six ceiling-level or floor-level exhausts with the same air change rate of 12.9 ACH. In Case 3, an air change rate of 6 ACH with the ceiling-level exhausts is studied. The comparison of Case 1 and Case 3 is used to quantify the effect of the decreasing ventilation rate. In addition, the simplified HCW motion by moving rectangular objects with a constant velocity (0.89 m/s) is included in Case 4. Finally there is no heat flux from HCW surface in Cases 1e4. Thus in Case 5, the HCW surface heat flux of 57.5 Watt/ m 2 is used.",

The concentration in Case 1 is much lower than that in Case 2. It confirms that the ceiling-level exhausts remove gaseous contaminants more efficiently than the floor-level exhausts. To explain this difference, Fig. 5c and d displays the flow vectors and temperature distribution in x \u00bc \u00c01.8 m (the centre plane of source manikin) in Cases 1 and 2. The upward thermal plume above the lying patient model interacts with the main ventilation airflow. With the ceiling-level exhausts (Case 1, see Fig. 5c ), this thermal plume above Patient 6 (source manikin) significantly enhances the upward flow induced by the ceiling-level exhausts and transports the exhaled contaminants to the ceiling level, part of which is removed out directly through the ceiling-level exhausts and the other joins the downward supply air stream. With the floor-level exhausts (Case 2, see Fig. 5d ), the downward supply air streams in the middle of room fall vertically onto the floor and all gaseous contaminants leave the room through the floor-level exhausts below the beds. The interaction between the upward thermal plume and the two-side downward supply air stream induce a mixing airflow pattern above the lying manikins. Obviously the arrangement of floor-level exhausts is less efficient in removing gaseous contaminants. Similar findings have been reported by Qian and Li [18] that the ceiling-level exhausts are much more efficient than the floor-level exhausts in removing fine particles.",

HCW walking starts at t \u00bc 0 s. At time of 0.02 s, Fig. 6a shows that the velocity and pressure fields near the walking HCW model quickly change. There is a high pressure zone in front of the walking HCW, low pressure zone in the wake behind it, and a large velocity close to it. At time of 0.2 s (see Fig. 6b ), there is more flow disturbance induced by the moving body and swinging arms/legs. The moving body displaces air in its front both forwardly and laterally, and its wake carries air forwardly. Meanwhile pressure difference (not shown here) induces air flowing from two lateral sides of the body to the wake behind the body, and also drives air flowing from the body front to the wake through the leakages between arms and the torso (or between two legs but not shown here). Moreover significant turbulence is produced near the walking HCW. Thus the realistic HCW walking does not simply Fig. 6c ), the disturbance of velocity and turbulence is weaker than that in Fig. 6b (t \u00bc 0.2 s) because the walking speed is relatively small at this moment. At time of 0.7 s (see Fig. 6d ), the disturbance of velocity and turbulence near the walking body becomes large again because the walking speed is great at this moment.

At time of 3.6 s (Fig. 6e) , the walking body is far from Patient 6 (i.e. source manikin). There is a forward flow in the wake which is about 2.5 m long.",

            "text": "This subsection discusses how HCW walking affects gaseous contaminant transport. Fig. 8 displays concentration (ppm) field in z \u00bc 1 m in Case 1 (left, ceiling-level) and Case 2 (right, floor-level) at various time. For both cases, gaseous contaminant is transported from source manikin to the other side of the isolation room by the human-walking-induced wake formation and by the residual wake after HCW motion stops. Moreover the concentration field changes a little from 0 s to 5.4 s, and varies more from 5.4 s to 18.4 s after the HCW model stops walking. The above facts show that, it takes a while for airborne transmission to respond to the flow disturbance induced by human walking. In addition, the concentration field in Case 1 at time of 35.4 s (see Fig. 8k ) is a little different from its initial state (see Fig. 8a , t \u00bc 0 s) because it has not returned to its initial state meanwhile HCW locations in the initial and final conditions are different; In Case 2 (see Fig. 8l ), that at time of 55.4 s differs a little from its initial state (see Fig. 8b , t \u00bc 0 s) due to similar reason. It verifies that the ceiling-level exhausts is more effective to remove the human-motion-induced pollutant transport. Finally, Fig. 8 also confirms that the concentration in Case 1 is always much lower than that in Case 2no matter with or without HCW walking. Thus the ventilation design is still the first key parameter and much more significant than the effect of HCW motion. In contrast to Case 1 (12.9 ACH, see Fig. 5a ), Case 3 (6 ACH, see Fig. 9a ) obviously attains much higher concentration at time of 0 s. As displayed in Fig. 9 , the human-walking-induced flow disturbance from 0 s to 5.4 s indeed produces gaseous contaminant transport from source manikin to the other side of the isolation room, but its residual flow produces more airborne spread from 5.4 s to 25.4 s after the HCW stops walking. Although the concentration field tends to return its initial state after time of 25.4 s, but there is still a little higher concentration near the HCW model at time of 45.4 s and 65.4 s (see Fig. 9feg ) than at time of 0 s (see Fig. 9a ). It verifies that, in contrast to Fig. 8k with 12.9 ACH, it takes more than 60 s in Case 3 (6 ACH) to remove or dilute pollutants near the stopped HCW model. In addition, the concentration in Case 1 (see Figs. 7 and 8, 12.9 ACH) is always much lower than that in Case 3 (see Figs. 9, 6 ACH) no matter whether HCW motion occurs. Therefore air change rate is another much more significant parameter than HCW walking in affecting airborne transmission.",

To the difference of flow disturbance induced by HCW geometries, Fig. 10 displays iso-surfaces of velocity at 0.4 m/s and flow field in z \u00bc 1 m at time of 4.06 s in Case 1 and Case 4. The realistic HCW motion (see Fig. 10a ) obviously induces less flow disturbance than the simplified one (see Fig. 10b ). The reason is that, the realistic Body A is a blunt geometry which has leakage between arms and the torso and between two legs. Body B has sharp-edged boundaries without such leakage, and it subsequently produces a stronger flow disturbance than Body A, enhancing the displacement flow in front of the body and strengthening the wake formation behind it.",

This subsection considers another situation that HCW model has stayed there for sufficiently long time (for example more than 10 min), thus the surface heat flux (57.5 Watt/m 2 ) of HCW model is taken into account in Case 5. Fig. 11a and b displays 3D iso-surfaces of concentration and concentration field in y \u00bc \u00c03.1 m of Case 1 and Case 5 at their initial conditions (t \u00bc 0 s). With the HCW surface heat flux (Case 5, see Fig. 11b ), gaseous contaminants released from the source manikin tend to spread more to the surrounding than Case 1. To illustrate the mechanisms, Fig. 11c and d shows temperature, velocity vector and turbulent kinetic energy in y \u00bc \u00c03.1 in Case 1 and Case 5. Obviously the thermal plume and turbulence surrounding and above the heated standing HCW model are stronger (Case 5, see Fig. 11d ) than Case 1 (see Fig. 11c ).

HCW model first walks for 5.4 s from the initial location near the source manikin to the other side of the isolation room, then it stops there for 60 s. The HCW walking indeed produces the flow disturbance and enhances airborne transmission from the source manikin to the other side, but the exhaust locations and air change rates are found more important than HCW walking. No matter with or without HCW motion, the ceiling-level exhausts with the air change rate of 12.9 ACH attain much lower concentration in this isolation room than the floor-level exhausts (12.9 ACH); With the same ceiling-level exhausts, a smaller air change rate (6 ACH) always experiences much higher concentration than a greater one (12.9 ACH).",

During the duration of HCW motion (5.4 s), tracer gas spreads a little from the source manikin to the other side, however after HCW walking stops the residual wake continues to induce more gaseous spread. It takes more than 30 se 60 s for the concentration field to approximately return to its initial state after HCW walking stops. The motion of HCW walking produces a complex mixing process. For realistic human walking with swinging legs and arms, the moving body displaces air parcels in front of the body forwardly and laterally, meanwhile a large pressure difference drives air from two lateral sides of HCW to the wake and from the body front backward to the wake through gaps between arms and legs. Significant turbulence is produced near HCW body. The simplified motion of rectangular block generates unrealistic stronger flow disturbance than realistic HCW walking.",
