            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes significant disease in immunocompromised patients and serious birth defects if acquired in utero. Available CMV antivirals target the viral DNA polymerase, have significant toxicities, and suffer from resistance. New drugs targeting different pathways would be beneficial. The anthraquinone emodin is proposed to inhibit herpes simplex virus by blocking the viral nuclease. Emodin and related anthraquinones are also reported to inhibit CMV. In the present study, emodin reduced CMV infectious yield with an EC 50 of 4.9 lM but was cytotoxic at concentrations only twofold higher. Related anthraquinones acid blue 40 and alizarin violet R inhibited CMV at only high concentrations (238-265 lM) that were also cytotoxic. However, atanyl blue PRL inhibited infectious yield of CMV with an EC 50 of 6.3 lM, significantly below its 50% cytotoxic concentration of 216 lM. Atanyl blue PRL reduced CMV infectivity and inhibited spread. When added up to 1 h after infection, it dramatically reduced CMV immediate early protein expression and blocked viral DNA synthesis. However, it had no antiviral activity when added 24 h after infection. Interestingly, atanyl blue PRL inhibited nuclease activities of purified CMV UL98 protein with IC 50 of 4.5 and 9.3 lM. These results indicate that atanyl blue PRL targets very early post-entry events in CMV replication and suggest it may act through inhibition of UL98, making it a novel CMV inhibitor. This compound may provide valuable insights into molecular events that occur at the earliest times post-infection and serve as a lead structure for antiviral development.",

None are approved for treatment or prevention of congenital infections. Thus, there is a pressing need for more potent, less toxic therapeutics to combat CMV infections.",

            "text": "Homologs of UL98 are encoded by all known herpesviruses. The alkaline nuclease encoded by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), UL12, is necessary for efficient replication in cell culture (Martinez et al., 1996; Shao et al., 1993) . Impaired replication has been linked to defects in DNA processing, capsid stability, and capsid nuclear egress (Martinez et al., 1996; Porter and Stow, 2004; Shao et al., 1993; Weller et al., 1990) . Recently our group showed that a CMV UL98 null mutant is severely compromised for replication (Kuchta et al., 2012) . At least one function of the CMV UL98 is likely to be similar to HSV-1 UL12 since the CMV UL98 gene can functionally complement the replication defect of HSV-1 UL12 null viruses (Gao et al., 1998) . A recent study indicated that the nuclease activity of UL12 is important for HSV-1 neurovirulence in mice yet is largely dispensable for replication in cell culture (Fujii et al., 2013) . In contrast, earlier studies indicated that the nuclease activity is important for in vitro replication since only alleles of HSV-1 UL12 that encoded a functional nuclease were able to complement replication of UL12 null mutant viruses (Goldstein and Weller, 1998; Henderson et al., 1998 Consistent with UL12 nuclease activity playing important roles both in vitro and in vivo, recent studies found that the anthraquinone emodin (Fig. 1) inhibits DNase activity of the HSV-1 UL12 in vitro, blocks replication of HSV-1 and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) in cell culture, and reduces viral pathogeneses in a mouse model (Hsiang and Ho, 2008; Xiong et al., 2011) . Earlier reports indicated that emodin and other anthraquinone derivatives also have CMV inhibitory activities (Barnard et al., 1992 (Barnard et al., , 1995 , although the mechanism of CMV inhibition has not been further studied. In the present study the anti-CMV activities of emodin and three related anthraquinones, atanyl blue PRL (also known as acid blue 129), acid blue 40, and alizarin violet R (Fig. 1) were evaluated. Atanyl blue PRL had anti-CMV activity and acted at an early post-entry stage of replication. Atanyl blue PRL also inhibited the nuclease activity of UL98, suggesting a potential mechanism of action in which UL98 activity is important early in the CMV replication cycle.",

CMV BADrUL131-Y4 (a gift from Thomas Shenk and Dai Wang) is a variant of CMV strain AD169 that contains a marker cassette encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of a simian virus 40 promoter inserted into UL21.5 (Wang and Shenk, 2005) . CMV RC2626 is a variant of CMV strain Towne containing a luciferase expression cassette under control of a synthetic P1125 promoter (composed of seven tetracycline operator elements, a 23-bp TAATA-containing element from the adenovirus major late promoter, and a 17-bp initiator from the mouse TdT gene promoter) inserted into the US2-US6 region (McVoy and Mocarski, 1999) . Expression of the relevant marker proteins (GFP or luciferase) encoded by these viruses can be detected as early as 24 h post infection (hpi). Viruses were propagated in MRC-5 cells and titered as described (Cui et al., 2012 (Cui et al., , 2008 Saccoccio et al., 2011b) .",

The first measured combined endonuclease and exonuclease activity as release of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) soluble-radioactivity from uniformly 14 C-labeled E. coli duplex DNA as described previously (Hoffmann and Cheng, 1978) . A unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to digest 1 ng of labeled DNA to TCA-solubility in 10 min at 37\u00b0C. Various compound concentrations were added to reaction mixes and assays were initiated by the addition of purified UL98 (1100 units). Control reactions contained 5% DMSO without compound. After incubation for 15 min at 37\u00b0C, reactions were terminated by addition of TCA to a 5% final concentration and 50 lg unlabeled, sonicated, and denatured salmon sperm DNA as carrier. The second assay used a doubly-quenched fluorescent hairpin probe to measure predominantly exonuclease activity in a fluorescent resonance emission transfer (FRET) assay. A synthetic 29-mer oligonucleotide was labeled at the 5 0 end with FAM fluorophore, between nucleotides 9 and 10 with ZEN quencher, and at the 3 0 end with Iowa Black dark quencher (IDT). The probe was heated to 95\u00b0C for 2 min and quenched on ice to form a hairpin containing a 4-bp 5 0 overhang. Exonucleolytic release of the 5 0 FAM-labeled nucleotide resulted in fluorescence. 70 ll assays containing 400 nM hairpin DNA substrate were incubated with 10 ll purified enzyme (1100 units as described above) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C and terminated by the addition of EDTA to 16 mM final concentration. 20 ll aliquots were transferred in triplicate to round-bottom black-walled 384-well pates and RFUs were measured using a SpectraMax M5 fluorometer (Molecular Devices). Controls containing substrates incubated without enzyme were used to determine background values, which were subtracted from experimental readings. Data for each inhibitor concentration were expressed as the percentage of maximal activities obtained from untreated controls (DNA plus enzyme in 5% DMSO).

The binding site was defined to encompass all atoms within 10 \u00c5 radius of Od1 of D254, which is located at the center of the active site. Default genetic algorithm parameters were used and a total of 50 solutions per compound were generated (no early termination, no constraints). The most plausible binding mode was identified using the HINT force-field (Kellogg and Abraham, 2000) . The ligand in its most favorable binding conformation was complexed with the protein and subjected to minimization (Powell minimization, 2500 iterations, termination gradient of 0.01 kcal/ mol-\u00c5) to remove steric clashes and optimize the protein-ligand interactions within the active site.",

Five dpi virus yields were measured by transfer of culture supernatants to uninfected MCR-5 cells and measurement of luciferase activity in these cultures 24 h later. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by adding the same concentrations of emodin to uninfected MRC-5 cells for 5 days and then measuring intracellular ATP levels as a function of luciferase activity using the CellTiter-Glo assay. Luciferase data were used to determine emodin's 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) for anti-CMV activity and 50% cytotoxic dose (TD 50 ) ( Table 1) . While the EC 50 of 4.9 lM confirmed that emodin inhibits CMV replication, emodin concentrations less than twofold higher were cytotoxic ( Fig. 2A and Table 1) . Thus, emodin's anti-CMV activity is likely to be non-specific and arise simply due to toxic effects on host cells.",

That addition of atanyl blue PRL at 24 hpi had no impact on yield strongly suggested that atanyl blue PRL does not affect CMV DNA synthesis or inhibit the viral DNA polymerase or other replication factors. To directly determine the impact of atanyl blue PRL on CMV DNA synthesis, CMV-infected cultures were either left untreated or treated with 28 lM atanyl blue PRL from the time of infection or starting at 24 hpi. Replicate cultures were harvested at 3, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hpi and relative copy numbers of intracellular CMV DNA were determined by qPCR. In untreated cultures, CMV DNA replication began between 24 and 48 hpi and copy number increased steadily thereafter (Fig. 5B) . However, when atanyl blue PRL was present from the time of infection, CMV DNA copy number remained low throughout the time course. Addition of atanyl blue PRL at 24 hpi delayed but did not prevent the onset of CMV DNA synthesis. Copy number began to increase at 72 hpi and exceeded the mock-treated control at 96 hpi (Fig. 5B) . These results confirm that atanyl blue PRL does not directly inhibit viral DNA syntheses.",

To determine if atanyl blue PRL inhibits the nuclease activity of Infectious yield (luciferase-based, 5 dpi, MOI = 0.03) 6.3 \u00b1 1.5 Viral gene expression (GFP-based, 4 dpi, MOI = 1) 6.2 \u00b1 0.9 Spread (GFP-based, 20 dpi, MOI = 0.1) 6.3 \u00b1 0.8 Infectivity (% GFP-positive wells) 7.1 \u00b1 6.0 Inhibition of UL98 total nuclease activity ( 14 C release) 4.5 \u00b1 0.7 Inhibition of UL98 5 0 exonuclease activity (fluorescence) 9.3 \u00b1 2.3 recombinant UL98, we performed two different assays. In the first, we measured the effect of increasing concentrations of the inhibitor on the ability of purified UL98 to degrade a uniformly labeled DNA substrate to a TCA-soluble form ($6-mer or less). This assay measures a combination of endonuclease and 5 0 -to-3 0 exo activities (Hoffmann and Cheng, 1978) . Atanyl blue PRL inhibited the release of soluble radioactivity with an IC 50 of 4.5 lM (Fig. 6A ). In contrast, the related compound acid blue 40 had little or no effect on the nuclease activity of UL98 at concentrations 10-fold higher (IC 50 = 99 lM). The second assay used a FRET assay to measure removal of a 5 0 labeled fluorophore from a 3 0 and internallyquenched hairpin DNA substrate by 5 0 to 3 0 exonuclease activity. In this assay atanyl blue PRL inhibited UL98's nuclease activity with an IC 50 of 9.3 lM, while again acid blue 40 had little inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 149 lM, Fig. 6B ). These results confirm that atanyl blue PRL inhibits the nuclease activity of purified UL98.",

Virus yields were determined 5 dpi by transfer of culture supernatants to fresh MRC-5 monolayers and quantitation of luciferase activity after incubation for 24 h. . Cell lysates were prepared on the indicated dpi and analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies specific to IE1/2. Images are composites from separate gels.

DNA was extracted from replicate cultures at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hpi and relative CMV DNA levels were determined by RT-qPCR. anthraquinone derivatives. The EC 50 of emodin for inhibiting CMV in our studies (4.9 lM) were remarkably similar to that reported by Barnard et al. (4.1 lM) (Barnard et al., 1992) (Table 1) . However, the high toxicities resulting in low SIs from both studies (Table 1) suggest that emodin's CMV inhibition likely arises through nonspecific disruption of cellular metabolic processes rather than inhibition of processes uniquely required for virus replication. In a subsequent study, Barnard et al. examined the anti-CMV activities of several anthraquinone derivatives (Barnard et al., 1995) . For acid blue 40 and alizarin violet R they reported EC 50 of 10 lM. We were unable to confirm these results. In our assays acid blue 40 and alizarin violet R had EC 50 of 205 and 183 lM and SIs of 0.9 and 1.4 (Table 1) , respectively, again suggesting a lack of specific antiviral activity. However, our EC 50 , TD 50 , and SI for atanyl blue PRL (6.3 lM, 216 lM, and 34 lM, respectively) were very similar to those reported by Barnard et al. (7 lM, 275 lM, and 40 lM) (Barnard et al., 1995) (Table 1 ).",

            "text": "In the present study we have extended these previous findings by demonstrating that atanyl blue PRL impairs CMV infectivity by severely reducing IE gene expression. Rapid and abundant accumulation of IE proteins through active transcription from the MIEP is crucial for driving CMV-infected cells forward in the lytic replication cycle. Conversely, repression of the MEIP leads to abortive infection and, in certain cell types, may promote establishment of latency. Repressive chromatinization of the MIEP is thought to occur by default upon delivery of the viral genome to the nucleus (Ioudinkova et al., 2006; Reeves et al., 2005a Reeves et al., , 2005b Sinclair, 2010) ; in order to enter lytic replication, the viral tegument protein pp71 must traffic to the nucleus where it acts to de-repress IE transcription by inducing degradation of Daxx (Saffert and Kalejta, 2006) . Atanyl blue PRL could interfere with IE protein expression at any point between attachment and IE transcription/translation. That exposure of the inoculum to an inhibitory dose of atanyl blue PRL prior to infection had no impact on viral yield suggests that atanyl blue PRL does not block viral entry by directly interacting with and irreversibly inactivating virions. Moreover, that atanyl blue PRL retains significant potency when added as late as 12 hpi further suggests that it does not interfere with viral attachment and entry, as these steps are largely completed within 1-3 hpi. Further studies will be needed to determine the exact stage at which atanyl blue PRL acts. It could interfere with capsid transport to nuclear pores, release of viral DNA, circularization of DNA, derepression of the MIEP, or IE transcription/translation. Two lines of evidence suggest that non-specific effects of atanyl blue PRL on viral DNA synthesis, RNA transcription, or protein synthesis can be ruled out. First, Barnard et al. measured the effects of atanyl blue PRL on cellular DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and observed IC 50 > 1000 lM (Barnard et al., 1995) . Second, atanyl blue PRL added at 24 hpi did not reduce viral DNA levels or infectious virus yield at 5 dpi (Figs. 4 and 5B) . At 24 hpi, viral DNA synthesis and transcription/translation of late proteins, which are necessary for assembly of viral progeny, are just beginning. Inhibition of either activity starting at 24 hpi should substantially reduce viral yield, as evidenced by the potent inhibitory effects of ganciclovir when added at 24, 48, and even 72 hpi (Fig. 4A ).",

The 4-position mesitylene moiety of atanyl blue PRL forms favorable hydrophobic interactions with W160, H161 and M165. In contrast, the 4-position N-phenylacetamide moiety of acid blue 40 forms weaker hydrophobic interactions owing to the polar amide substitution on its phenyl ring.

Another key non-covalent interaction observed is the p-p stacking interaction between the guanidinium ion of R164 and the 4-position aromatic substituent.

Consistent with this, low levels of UL98 have been observed in infected cells as early as 5 hpi (Adam et al., 1995) , coinciding with the time window that atanyl blue PRL is active. However, a role for UL98 early but not late in CMV replication would contrast with proposed roles for the HSV-1 UL12 alkaline nuclease late in the HSV-1 life cycle in supporting recombination-dependent DNA replication (Reuven et al., 2003) , DNA packaging, capsid formation, and nuclear egress (Martinez et al., 1996; Porter and Stow, 2004; Shao et al., 1993; Weller et al., 1990) . While it is possible that UL98 and UL12 serve very different functions in replication of their respective viruses, it is also possible that atanyl blue PRL's inhibition of UL98 nuclease activity is coincidental and that its true mechanism of CMV inhibition involves a different viral or cellular target that is important early in CMV replication.",

This would signal a profound revision of our understanding of how herpesvirus alkaline nucleases function during viral replication. ",

Modeled molecular interactions of atanyl blue PRL (A) and acid blue 40 (B) (ligand -ball and stick representation; carbon -cyan) with the active site residues of UL98 (stick representation; carbon -green). The double-stranded DNA substrate is shown as transparent sticks (carbon -white) and the active-site Mg 2+ ion shown as magenta sphere. H-bond interactions of the sulfonate with R164 and S252 of UL98 are shown as magenta dashed-lines and coordination interactions of metal ion with carboxylates of D254 and E278 of UL98 and the 9-position oxo group of ligand are shown as solid magenta lines. Lipophilic surface potential maps of the 4-position substitutions of atanyl blue PRL (C) and acid blue 40 (D) within the active site of UL98. The scale at the bottom indicates the color gradient -brown (lipophilic LP/hydrophobic) to blue (hydrophilic HP/polar).
