            "text": "Wnt proteins bind to seven-transmembrane Frizzled receptors to mediate the important developmental, morphogenetic, and tissue-regenerative effects of Wnt signaling. Dysregulated Wnt signaling is associated with many cancers. Currently there exist no drug candidates, or even tool compounds that modulate Wnt-mediated receptor trafficking, and subsequent Wnt signaling. We examined libraries of FDA-approved drugs for their utility as Frizzled internalization modulators, employing a primary imaged-based GFP-fluorescence assay that uses Frizzled1 endocytosis as the readout. We now report that the anti-helminthic niclosamide, a drug used for the treatment of tapeworm, promotes Frizzled1 endocytosis, down regulates Dishevelled-2 protein, and inhibits Wnt3A-stimulated \u03b2-catenin stabilization and LEF/TCF reporter activity. Additionally, following niclosamide mediated internalization, the Frizzled1 receptor co-localizes in vesicles containing Transferrin and agonist-activated \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptor. Therefore, niclosamide may serve as a negative modulator of Wnt/Frizzled1 signaling by depleting up-stream signaling molecules (i.e. Frizzled and Dishevelled), and moreover may provide a valuable means to study the physiological consequences of Wnt signaling.",

Due to their accessibility, plasma membrane receptors like Frizzled are also appealing as targets of prescription drugs. However, there are currently no FDA-approved drugs or tool compounds that regulate Wnt signaling at the level of the Frizzled receptor. To address this need, we have instituted a translational small molecule screening program to identify candidate leads that affect Frizzled endocytosis. Furthermore, to expedite the development of Wnt/Frizzled signaling modulators, we searched existing libraries containing FDA-approved drugs, and we have now discovered that the anti-helminthic niclosamide promotes Frizzled1 (Fzd1) internalization, and in the presence of Wnt3A, blocks downstream \u03b2-catenin signaling.",

Frizzled1-GFP localized predominantly to the plasma membrane with almost no internalized vesicles present when the cells were not stimulated with Wnt ligands (Fig. 1A ).

In contrast, biotinylated Frizzled1-GFP receptors exposed to niclosamide at the permissible internalization temperature of 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 3 , Lane 4) produce a strong immunoblot signal compared to cells not treated with niclosamide (Fig. 3 , Lane 3), indicating that the niclosamide-internalized Frizzled1 receptors originate on the plasma membrane.",

The demonstration that internalized Frizzled1-GFP co-localizes with either \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptor-RFP or Transferrin in intracellular vesicles would indicate Frizzled1 also internalizes in a similar manner. Fig. 6A-6C show cells expressing both \u03b2 2 AR and Frizzled1 receptors prior to activation, and under these conditions the two receptors are not intracellularly co-localized. Exposure to isoproterenol and niclosamide for 2 or 6 hrs ( Fig.  6D-6I ) results in multiple overlapping intracellular distributions of each receptor. Moreover, internalized Transferrin at 2 hrs has significant co-localization with internalized Frizzled1 (Fig.  6J-6L) .

Its most common therapeutic usage is in the treatment of intestinal tapeworm infections (18) , but niclosamide also has demonstrated activity against mollusks. For example, niclosamide is widely used in China as a molluscoside in an attempt to eradicate schistosome containing snails (19) . More recently, niclosamide was found to be effective at low micromolar concentrations in preventing the synthesis of corona virus proteins in a tissue culture model of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (20) . Its mechanism of action in this instance has not been well defined, but niclosamide can interact with DNA (20) . It is believed that niclosamide uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in the tapeworm (21) .",

            "text": "There are currently no radiolabeled Wnt binding assays for Frizzled, preventing a direct test of niclosamide's ability to compete for the Wnt3A binding site on Frizzled1. However, our data indicate that niclosamide can be used as a tool compound to modulate Wnt/Frizzled function in the study of cancer and regeneration at the molecular level. Niclosamide has proven safe in humans when administered for short durations. In exploring the clinical utility of niclosamide as a possible cancer treatment, its ability to block Wnt directed transcriptional activity will have to be weighed against its other biological effects. However, in cases of refractory cancers the benefits may be worth the risks. Alternatively, with structural modification, derivatives of niclosamide may eventually provide safe and effective drug therapies for patients with underlying Wnt directed cancers. Fzd1-GFP stable U2OS cells were subjected to cell-surface biotin labeling at 4 \u00b0C as described in Materials and Methods. The upper panel shows an immunoblot (IB) for biotin-labeled Frizzled1-GFP enriched using a Neutravidin bead pull down and anti-GFP antibody for Frizzled1-GFP detection. \u03b2-actin in the lower panel serves as loading control to ensure that equal amount of cell lysate were used for the Neutravidin pull down. The treatments of surface biotinylation, glutathione, niclosamide, and temperature are indicated above the blots. (A-E) Fzd1-GFP stable U2OS cells were treated with niclosamide (12.5 \u03bcM) for indicated times (0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hrs). (F) Internalization was assessed by counting the number of Frizzled1-GFP containing vesicles in the cytosol using the computer program Metamorph, and the results are presented in the graph for the given times (0 hr, n = 51 cells; 1 hr, n = 69; 2 hr, n = 32; 4 hr, n = 55, and 6 hr, n = 61). Paired data against time 0 hr were analyzed by Students t-test with a significance of P \u2264 0.0005, ***. Fig. 4 for the respective number of cells corresponding to an individual dose: n = 51, 42, 75, 64, 55, and 57. Data were analyzed paired against 0 \u03bcM sample using Students t-test with a significance of P \u2264 0.0005, ***. (J-L) depicts similar studies in cells expressing the Fzd1-GFP and exposed to Alexa-546 Transferrin (Tf) at 100 \u03bcg/ml and 12.5 \u03bcM niclosamide for 2 hrs at 37 \u00b0C. The merged imaged is presented in (L). Arrowheads indicate co-localized vesicles. (A-B) HEK293 cells stably expressing TOPFlash luciferase reporter and Renilla luciferase were treated with control conditioned medium or Wnt3A conditioned medium in the presence of DMSO (vehicle) or niclosamide (niclo). The inhibitory effect on Wnt3A stimulated TOPFlash reporter activity by 12.5 \u03bcM niclosamide is shown in (A). ns, not significant (P>0.05); ***, P<0.0001, t-tests. CTL CM and Wnt3A CM depict control and Wnt3A conditioned medium, respectively. (B) demonstrates that the inhibition is dependent on the niclosamide concentration. The average TOPFlash reporter activity of Wnt3A plus DMSO treatment was set as 100%, and the relative reporter activity of Wnt3A plus the indicated concentration of niclosmide was calculated and plotted. (C-D) Niclosamide inhibits Wnt3A-stimulated cytosolic \u03b2-catenin stabilization in U2OS cells as demonstrated by immunoblotting of cytosolic \u03b2-catenin. \u03b2-actin serves as a loading control. (C) shows the effect of 7.5 \u03bcM niclosamide treatment, whereas (D) demonstrates that this inhibitory effect occurs over a range of 1-7.5 \u03bcM niclosamide (n=3).",
