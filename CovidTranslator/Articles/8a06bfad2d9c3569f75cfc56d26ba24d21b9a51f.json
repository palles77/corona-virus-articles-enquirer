With embolization, an artery is suddenly occluded, usually by a thrombus that arises from a distant site, such as in the heart (blood clot) or a neoplasm (e.g., neoplastic cells from hemangiosarcoma).

Provide oxygen to prevent further tissue hypoxia. D. Turn recumbent animals every 6 hours, and keep them clean and well padded. E. Provide nutritional support after they are stabilized. II. Specifi c therapy is directed at reducing cerebral edema and intracranial pressure. A. Recumbent animals are positioned with their heads slightly elevated (15 to 30 degrees). B. Osmotic therapy is started for cerebral edema.1. Mannitol 0.25 to 1.0 g/kg IV over 10 to 15 minutes 2. Hypertonic saline 7% 1 to 5 mL/kg IV over 3 to 5 minutes 3. Furosemide (0.7 mg/kg IV) can be given 15 minutes after mannitol to prolong its effect. 4. Osmotic therapy can be repeated every 6 to 8 hours unless dehydration or hypernatremia develops. 5. Electrolytes, PCV, and TS are monitored closely with osmotic therapy. C. Osmotic therapy is contraindicated in hypovolemic animals and those with clinical signs suggestive of active intracranial hemorrhage. D. Surgery is indicated for depressed skull fractures or if the animal's condition deteriorates despite medical management.",
