            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the principal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Although the prevalence of the disease is moderately low averaging about 40 cases per 100,000 people in high risk areas, it is a particularly devastating disease. It primarily affects young adults, is chronic, and has an unpredictable course. Most discouraging, the cause of the disease is not known and an effective treatment has not been identified. Recently, however, research has yielded some important findings concerning the etiology of MS. Much evidence now points to an immunological process as one of the major elements in the disease (1) . It is also likely that an environmental influence, possibly an infectious process, may contribute to the disease. Finally, it is now certain that genetic makeup influences susceptibility to the disease. Presently, the strongest evidence is for a polygenic effect, not the effect of a single gene or gene locus.",

            "text": "If most or all of the CSF Ig is not directly related to the cause of the disease, why do elevated levels occur in the CSF? A likely explanation is that the CSF Ig reflects the specificity of B cells that are found in greatest number in the blood, and therefore, have the greatest chance of migrating into an inflammatory site in the CNS. The antibody specificities found in the CSF of MS patients are generally those with high titers in the blood such as antibodies to viruses that are associated with lifelong immunity. Although the accumulation of these B cells may be random, the conditions permitting their differentiation into Ig-secreting cells must be present within the CNS. Generally, differentiation of and Ig production by B cells requires two signals, one of which is the perturbation of the Ig antigen receptor. If the antigens to which these antibodies react are not in the CNS, the continued differentiation of B cells must be due to factors in the CNS milieu that are capable of overriding the need for antigen binding to the Ig receptor. This could include lymphokines produced by the ongoing immune response or to the effect of neurotransmitters with immunostimulatory activity. Obviously, an alternative explanation is that the antigen necessary to drive these B cells is in the CNS. This would suggest that multiple viruses could contribute to the disease process in some manner. Direct evidence for this is lacking. Probably the most consistent antiviral antibody found in CSF of MS patients is that to measles virus (7) . Although measles virus genome has been demonstrated in brain material from some MS patients (8) , the finding is not specific for MS and efforts to demonstrate the virus by other means have been unsuccessful. It is unlikely that the elevation in antimeasles antibody can be explained by cross-s9x MCFARLAND AND DHIB-J.AI.BU I reactivity between the virus and antigens in the nervous system since antibodies to at least four of the five protein components of the virus are elevated (Dhib-Jalbut and McFarland, unpublished data).",

Similarities between MS and a model of cell-mediated immunopathological disease of the CNS. experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). support a similar mechanism in MS. The objections to the appropriateness of EAE as a model for MS have been partially overcome by the demonstration of an experimentally produced relapsing remitting disease with close pathological similarities to MS (9) .

These studies, as well as similar studies of demyelination in EAE, indicate that myelin disruption follows an interaction between myelin and macrophages and that characteristic coated pits are found at the point of myelin-macrophage contact. These coated pits most likely represent the migration of receptors within the macrophage membrane. A critical question is what are the receptors that are concentrated in the coated pit?

Antibody to glactocerebroside (11) and possibly other myelin components have been shown to contribute to the induction of EAE in the guinea pig. Also, transfer of antibody against components of myelin to mice with a relapsing form of EAE seem to augment demyelination and enhance progression of the disease (12) .

Demyelination occurs in association with infections with several viruses in the retrovirus family. Infection of sheep with Visna virus produces an encephalitis that is characterized by inflammation and demyelination (14) . Demyelination can also be a prominent finding in AIDS-related dementia caused by infection with HIV (15) . Finally, abnormalities of white matter have been demonstrated by MRI in tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) due to infection with HTLV-I (16) . In Visna and AIDS, virus is found in the CNS in macrophages and this may form the basis for entry into the nervous system (17, 18) . HTLV-I has also been isolated from lymphocytes from patients with TSP and this may provide a similar basis for entry into the CNS in this disease (19) . The cause of demyelination in these diseases is uncertain and may be due to infection of oligodendrocytes. The possibility that macrophages infected with viruses, particularly retroviruses, can cause destruction or damage to myelin directly must be considered as well. A possible mechanism could be production of cytokines toxic to myelin. At least in Visna, this seems unlikely, since disease is reduced by treatment with immunosuppressive drugs indicating that demyelination may be immune mediated (42) . Although a similiar process would seem unlikely in AIDS which is associated with profound immunosuppression, a role for an immunopathological process in this disease must still be considered.",

Recent studies of EAE have now demonstrated fluctuating courses under several experimental conditions. Importantly, a relapsing form of EAE has been produced in mice following the transfer of T cells from mice sensitized to MBP (9) . Further, the pathological appearance of the CNS of these mice closely resembles that found in patients with MS.

In a separate study using T cell clones generated from the CSF and blood of MS patients, MBP reactive clones could not be recovered from the CSF of MS patients but were generated from CSF lymphocytes obtained from patients with postinfectious encephalomyelitis (22) . In the same study, T cell clones were generated from lymphocytes obtained from the brain of a patient with MS who had died. None of the clones reacted with MBP. These findings suggest that, even at the site of demyelination, MBP reactive T cells cannot be readily demonstrated. This study probably does not provide a definitive answer to this problem since it can be argued that if lymphocytes were obtained at the very earliest stages of disease, T cells with more relevant specificities might be recovered. Also, in studies of viral infections in the brain in which the inflammatory response is known to be generated by viral reactive T cells. only very small numbers of cells with the relevant specificity have been recovered from the inflammatory site (43) . This indicates that a very small number of antigen reactive T cells are capable of initiating an inflammatory response and that the recovery of these cells from the site may be extremely difficult. The evidence for a role for MBP reactive T cells in MS is unconvincing but unfortunately the question is not completely resolved.",

A relationship between a virus and MS has been supported by epidemiological studies showing a variation between incidence of disease and geographic region and by the apparent occurrence of small focal epidemic phase of disease (23) . In addition, elevations in antibody to various viruses have been found in the CSF of patients with MS (44) . Additional support for a relationship between MS and a virus comes from studies of SlOl various experimental models of virus-induced demyelination. One of the most important of these models is Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection in mice (24) . Infection of some strains of mice with TMEV, a picomavirus, produces, after one to several months, a neurological disease that is characterized pathologically by inflammation and demyelination. The disease appears to be immunologically mediated and susceptibility is influenced by the genetic makeup of the mouse (25) . The genetic factors include genes in the MHC and probably another genetic locus, possibly genes coding for the B chain of the T cell receptor (25) . Susceptibility to disease correlates closely with the ability to generate a DTH response to the virus. Consequently, it has been proposed that T cells recognize virus in the CNS and trigger a DTH response. The subsequent recruitment and activation of macrophages then leads to demyelination.",

Recently, the generation of virus specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) was examined in patients with MS and in appropriate control groups (26). The findings demonstrated that a substantial number of patients had a significant reduction in their ability to generate measles virus-specific CTL. In contrast, their ability to generate influenza virus-specific CTL was normal. The abnormality in measles virus CTL is due to a S-to IO-fold reduction in the precursor frequency of the population and not due to their complete absence (27) . Importantly, measles virus CTL are CD4+ lymphocytes and recognize measles virus antigens in conjunction with class II HLA molecules. This is in distinction to most other well-characterized virus-specific CTL which are predominantly CD8' and HLA class I restricted.

Even inactivated virus seems to be capable of inducing MHC class II antigen on astrocytes and this could be achieved more easily on astrocytes derived from strains of rats susceptible to EAE. These findings indicate that persistent infection could contribute to expression of MHC molecules and that this, in turn, could lead to presentation of either viral or neural antigens. This provides an alternative mechanism by which a viral infection could lead to sensitization to CNS antigens. Importantly, this suggests that a persistent infection could be instrumental to s103 disease production triggered by T cell reactivity to nonviral antigens. A diminished cellular immune response to the virus might increase the likelihood of this since there would be a reduced ability to eliminate virus. Differences in the ability to induce HLA molecules in humans similar to those demonstrated in those experimental animals could represent one of the components of the genetic susceptibility to MS. Clearly, the mechanisms regulating expression of the molecules may be critical to understanding MS. REGULATION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE One of the striking characteristics of MS is its frequent relapsing remitting course. This has led to speculation that the disease may be related to an abnormality of suppressor cell function with reduced suppression resulting in episodes of disease activity followed by return of suppressor function or local regulation of the response. In fact, deficiencies of suppressor cells have been demonstrated in several experimental, in vitro, systems (1) . The finding that a reduced number of CDS+ T cells, which includes suppressor cells, occurs during periods of worsening has been inconsistent. Functional studies have shown, however, that there is reduced suppression during progression or exacerbation. These studies have measured suppression as generated by mitogens such as concanavalin A or OKT3 which binds to the T cell receptor (36) . Similarly, the ability of CD8+ T cells to suppress Ig production following PWM stimulation is reduced while other functional parameters of the CD8+ T cells such as CTL activity are normal (37) . A subset of CD4+ cells, the 2H4 cells, which acts to induce suppression through CD8+ T cells, has been shown to be reduced in MS patients with active disease (38) .",

MS is not associated with multiple immunological abnormalities which casts some doubt on generalized suppressor cell deficiency but episodic fluctuations in regulatory mechanisms could be involved in exacerbation. Alternatively, these changes in immunoregulation could occur as a result of the same process that triggers the immune response occurring within the CNS. For example, upregulation in HLA class II antigen expression could lead to increased reactivity in all of these in vitro tests and account for the apparent reduction in suppression. Studies of immune regulation are critical to an understanding of the immune process in MS and future studies hopefully will establish if these changes represent reduced suppression or enhanced reactivity secondary to the disease process. CONCLUSION The evidence linking the pathogenesis of MS to an immunological process remains indirect and tentative. It seems increasingly certain that the actual de-struction of myelin is caused by activated macrophages. What is uncertain is the mechanism for activation of these macrophages. Although an immunological mechanism would seem most likely, it is still possible that this activation could occur as a direct result of a viral infection. By extrapolating from observations made in various experimental models, it seems that the most likely immunological process would be the induction of a DTH type response with subsequent macrophage activation. Either a neural or viral antigen could trigger this response and the genetic influence on susceptibility may reflect the genes coding for the HLA class II and T cell receptor makeup necessary for recognition of the relevant antigen. The failure to demonstrate a unique or enhanced T cell reactivity is disturbing, but could be due to the techniques used or to a sequestration of this population within the CNS. This latter possibility seems the least likely and has little support from experimental models.",

It is also likely that microglia can also express class II HLA molecules and function as antigen-presenting cells. The nonspecific induction of HLA class II antigens on these populations by lymphokines such as interferon-y provides an attractive mechanism for presenting antigen to circulating cells and triggering a local immune response which leads to demyelination. Periodic increases in HLA class II expression due to nonspecific processes such as viral infections could provide a reasonable explanation for the fluctuating course of the disease. With continued disease progression, the local production of lymphokines may become sufficient to maintain an ongoing immune response.",

B cells with appropriate specificities migrating into the inflammatory site would find both antigen and lymphokines necessary for B cell differentiation. The continued differentiation of B cells with production of antimyelin antibody could contribute to the conversion of the disease from a relapsingremitting course into one of continued progression.",

The ability of T cells to recognize epitopes consisting of only several amino acids and which are not recognized by antibody may contribute to the difficulty of answering these questions. It is hoped that the techniques that allow manipulation of HLA genes and identification of characteristics of the T cell receptor makeup along with more specific immunological methods will contribute a greater understanding to these questions.",
