The uptake rates ranged from 3% in Finland to 60% in the US (Ruutu et al., 2004; United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2010) . Several strategies involving health care professionals in improving the uptake rate of PPV have been proved effective in randomized trials. A computerized system reminding health professionals about the eligibility of patients for PPV increased the uptake rate from 0.8% to 35.8%, while an education program for patients through videotape-brochure was more effective than video-only and the control group (Dexter et al., 2001; Thomas et al., 2003) . A program with educational outreaching visits about the importance of vaccination to practicing physicians and a nurse-delivered education intervention to patients on discharge increased the vaccination rates (Siriwardena et al., 2002; Thomas et al., 2005) . However, to the best of our knowledge, no study on testing the use of a nurse-delivered brief telephone and face-to-face health education intervention to promote PPV uptake in Asian countries has been reported.",

Prior to 2007, vaccination for pneumococcal infection was not common and the estimated use of PPV was less than 10% for those aged over 65 years (Ho et al., 2004) . The uptake rate of influenza vaccination was also very low even after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and substantial promotion from the Government, as reflected by a 2004 study in Hong Kong which estimated that about 70% of patients visiting a public clinic did not have influenza vaccination within the past 5 years of the clinic visit (Mok et al., 2006) . Consequently, additional efforts, other than mass media promotion, are needed to improve the uptake rate of vaccination. As PPV is relatively new to people in Hong Kong, it is important to implement and evaluate appropriate health education interventions to promote PPV and improve the vaccination rate, especially in vulnerable older patients with chronic diseases. Nurses are the largest group of health care professionals who have the greatest frequency and duration of contact with patients, and thus have a strong potential to influence patients' behaviors.",

Thus, the required sample size calculated in the current study was on the basis of an increase in the vaccination rate from 54% to 61% (Thomas et al., 2005) , a ratio of control to intervention participants of 1:1, 80% power, and a significance level of 5%.

Previous studies reported ICC was typically around 0.05 for primary care trials and usually less than 0.01 for community-based randomized trials (Campbell et al., 2007) . As the current study included chronic patients receiving secondary care treatment in the clinics, we took the ICC = 0.01 in calculating the sample size. This gave a target sample size of a total 2250 subjects, with 1125 subjects in each group.

The overall standard promotion of PPV at the clinics, and the telephone calls prior to the scheduled appointments for completing the baseline questionnaires might have exerted some effects on raising the awareness of PPV in both groups. Providing health information such as promotional leaflet, poster, and educational video can raise the awareness of patients about the health problems, but adding a multiple component health education intervention, with direct communication with the older patients offering an opportunity for support can further motivate older patients to receive PPV. Subjects in this study were older patients with chronic diseases and low education levels, and Table 1 Baseline characteristics of subjects in the intervention and control groups, n (%) unless otherwise stated.",

About one-third of the patients who did not receive the vaccination reported that there was no need to receive the vaccine, suggesting more intensive intervention is needed to understand the reasons behind such thoughts and to motivate this group to consider the vaccination. Although previous studies showed that advice from physicians on PPV was one of the crucial factors in promoting the uptake of the vaccination (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2010) , family doctors at the clinics in Hong Kong have a very heavy workload that they can only spend a few minutes with every patient (Hedley, 1990) . Hence nurses can fill this important gap, and as indicated in this study, about two-third of the patients reported they had received advices from nurses about receiving PPV.",

Nevertheless, there were a few limitations in this study. First, the subjects were limited to older patients with chronic diseases and hence the results may not be entirely comparable to other studies which targeted all elders aged over 65 years. Furthermore, although all the five selected clinics were from the same region in Hong Kong, they had variations in their services provided and population served. For example, the three GOPCs provided primary medical care services and their patients had less acute chronic illnesses such as hypertension, while the two SOPCs provided follow up consultations, and their patients might have more acute illnesses and usually require more frequent follow ups. Further studies with a wider coverage of all elders from different regions in Hong Kong would be desirable. Second, only 58.4% (n = 730) of the patients in the intervention group had received both telephone briefing and on-site faceto-face intervention in the real clinical situation, hence the intervention effect could have been weakened. This situation was due to the busy day-to-day clinic routine, thus preventing the nurses from approaching all the randomized patients. In addition, some patients in both groups did not turn up at their scheduled appointments and hence did not receive the onsite intervention, leading to a 41.6% (n = 521) of the intervention group only received telephone briefing. Although the sensitive analysis showed the intervention effect remained significant by treating the 11 patients in the control group who had received the faceto-face health education at the clinics, future studies would require integrating health education into clinic procedures to improve efficiency. Third, we had underestimated the ICC in sample size calculation that the ICC in this study was similar to clinical studies, not in between clinical and community studies (Campbell et al., 2007) as expected. The underestimation of ICC inevitably lowered the statistical power of the study. A retrospective calculation of the power of the study using an estimated ICC of 0.051 indicating the study only has a power of 0.44 to detect a difference on 7% in the PPV uptake rates between the two groups at a 5% significance level. Fourth, the physical space of some clinics was very small and crowded with patients with no designated space for delivering health education, hence limiting the quality of delivering the intervention. Fifth, we had included medical and nursing students to deliver the second component of the intervention which might have induced variability in the quality of the intervention, although prior training was provided. Because they had less experience in health promotion, the intervention effect might have been weakened. Finally, only one-third of the eligible patients consented to the study which might also limited the generalizability of the current findings. The situation, however, was expected as PPV was very new to people in Hong Kong and a certain degree of reluctance to try a new type of vaccination is expected. Furthermore, the study included multiple components and follow-up telephone calls and older patients might not want to be engaged into these activities. As a result, those participated in the study could be more cooperative and willing to take risks (from the patient's perspective) and hence willingness to receive PPV might be greater in both groups.",
