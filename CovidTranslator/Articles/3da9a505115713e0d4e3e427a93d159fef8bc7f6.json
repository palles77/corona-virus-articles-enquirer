This evolutionary plasticity makes viruses an invaluable system to identify new mechanisms used not only by viruses but also by vertebrate cells to modulate gene expression. Here, I discuss the identification and characterization of viral mRNA structures and noncoding RNAs that have led to important insights into the molecular mechanisms of eukaryotic cells. The HIV-1 Tat protein activates transcription of the HIV-1 provirus by recruiting the cellular P-TEFb complex to the viral TAR RNA hairpin. Nuclear export of incompletely spliced HIV-1 transcripts is facilitated by the RRE RNA structure, which recruits a complex consisting of the viral Rev protein and cellular CRM1. A similar function is performed by the CTE RNA structure present in MPMV, which recruits the cellular Tap nuclear export factor. The cytoplasmic translation of picornaviral mRNAs is facilitated by IRES elements, and the translation of retroviral and coronaviral mRNAs is modulated by sequences that induce ribosomal frameshifting. Finally, the translation of both viral and cellular mRNAs can be specifically downregulated by virally encoded microRNAs.",

These phosphorylation events render RNAP II elongation competent and allow it to transcribe the entire viral genome (Barboric and Peterlin, 2005; Kao et al., 1987) . In contrast, in the absence of Tat or TAR, transcription initiation at the LTR promoter still occurs but almost all of these initiating RNAP II molecules fall off the DNA template within ~200 bp of the transcription start site. Analysis of Tat function led to the realization that not only transcription initiation but also transcription elongation can regulate gene expression levels in animal cells (Barboric and Peterlin, 2005) .",

            "text": "An important part of the answer emerged from analysis of a second retrovirus called Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV). MPMV has a simpler genomic organization than HIV-1 and only encodes the three structural proteins Picornaviruses and some flaviviruses Recruits cellular translation factors and ribosomal subunits to viral translation initiation codons in the absence of an mRNA cap Gag, Pol, and Env. Nevertheless, MPMV expresses both a genome-length Gag/ Pol mRNA and a spliced Env mRNA. As MPMV does not encode a Rev homolog, how do the incompletely spliced genomic MPMV mRNAs reach the cytoplasm? This question led to the discovery of an RNA stem-loop structure within the MPMV genome, the constitutive transport element (CTE), that mediates the nuclear export of incompletely spliced mRNAs in the absence of any viral proteins (Bray et al., 1994) . Further analysis revealed that the CTE recruits a heterodimer of two cellular proteins, Tap and p15, that also plays a critical role in the nuclear export of the majority of cellular mRNAs (Gr\u00fcter et al., 1988; Kohler and Hurt, 2007) . Normally, the Tap/p15 heterodimer is only recruited to mature, fully spliced mRNAs. However, the CTE is able to prematurely recruit Tap/p15 to partially spliced mRNAs and thereby circumvents the nuclear retention of incompletely spliced MPMV mRNAs. Although CTEs have now been defined in several other exogenous and endogenous retroviruses, not all CTEs act by directly recruiting Tap/p15. In particular, the avian leukemia virus CTE does not appear to bind to Tap or p15 directly, although Tap may be required for its function (LeBlanc et al., 2007) . Further analysis may reveal new insights into how the export of retroviral nuclear mRNAs is regulated.",

First, the single genome-length picornavirus mRNA is uncapped.

The IRES directly recruits several eIFs and the 40S ribosomal subunit to an internal viral translation initiation codon without the requirement for either cap binding or 5\u2032UTR scanning. As a result, poliovirus translation is independent of the host cell cap recognition factor eIF4E. Moreover, although poliovirus translation initiation does require eIF4G, it functions perfectly well with the carboxy-terminal fragment of eIF4G that is generated by the proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G by a virus-encoded protease. Because capdependent translation requires fulllength eIF4G, this cleavage blocks host cell translation, whereas viral mRNA translation is not only unimpeded but in fact is enhanced by the access of viral mRNAs to the entire pool of available eIFs and ribosomal subunits (Martinez-Salas et al., 2008) .",

An even more unusual IRES is found in cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), a picornavirus-like insect virus (Jan et al., 2003; Pestova and Hellen, 2003) . The CrPV IRES not only is able to recruit both the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits to assemble elongation-competent 80S ribosomes on viral mRNAs but also acts as a mimic of Met-tRNAi to permit initiation of the translation of viral capsid proteins in the absence of Met-tRNAi.",

Frameshifting is induced by a bipartite element consisting of a 5\u2032 frameshifting site and an adjacent 3\u2032 RNA structure (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006; Jacks et al., 1988) . The frameshift site has the consensus sequence X_XXY_YYZ (where the translational phase is indicated), which then slips into the \u22121 frame, that is, XXX_YYY_Z. The actual shift sites found in HIV-1 and the SARS coronavirus are U_UUU_UUA and U_UUA_AAC, respectively. The 3\u2032 RNA structure found in HIV-1 is thought to be a simple RNA hairpin but other \u22121 frameshifting signals instead contain a pseudoknot 3\u2032 to the frameshift signal (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006) . It has been proposed that the function of the 3\u2032 RNA structure is to induce transient ribosomal pausing at the frameshift site to facilitate ribosomal slippage in the \u22121 direction. Although frameshifting in HIV-1 occurs with an efficiency of ~5%, frameshifting efficiency in other viruses can be as high as ~25% and may be facilitated by a direct interaction between the paused ribosome and the downstream pseudoknot structure. Programmed frameshifting is not unique to viruses but is found also in a small number of cellular genes in both eukaryotes and bacteria (Shigemoto et al., 2001; Tsuchihashi and Kornberg, 1990) .",

Indeed, RNAi continues to represent a key component of the antiviral response in plants and invertebrates (Cullen, 2006) . The triggers for RNAi in these species are the long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that form critical intermediates in the replication of all RNA viruses except retroviruses. These dsRNAs are bound by the RNase III-related enzyme Dicer, which progressively cleaves these dsRNAs into ~22 bp RNA duplexes containing terminal 2 nt 3\u2032 overhangs (see Review by R.W. Carthew and E.J. Sontheimer in this issue of Cell). One strand of this duplex, called a small-interfering RNA (siRNA), is then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where it acts as a guide for RNA to target RISC to complementary regions of viral genomic, anti-genomic, or mRNA species. RISC then cleaves these viral RNAs, leading to their degradation. The first siRNAs to be identified were in fact antiviral siRNAs produced in tobacco cells infected by a pathogenic RNA virus, potato virus X (Hamilton and Baulcombe, 1999) .",

Because of the importance of RNAi as an antiviral defense in plants and insects, many RNA viruses that infect these species have evolved gene products that inhibit RNAi and, hence, enhance virus replication. Conversely, the absence of antiviral RNAi responses in mammalian cells means that the RNAi machinery in these cells generally remains active during viral infection (Figure 1) .",

Remarkably, the function of this RNA in the viral life cycle is still unclear.

Insertion of this viral RNA element in cis also increases the nuclear abundance of cellular mRNAs, such as \u03b2-globin mRNAs, that are normally unstable when expressed in an intronless form (Conrad et al., 2006) .

This interaction stabilizes the production of ATP in infected cells and also inhibits virally induced apoptosis (Reeves et al., 2007) . Another noncoding RNA, the VA1 RNA expressed by adenovirus, also binds to a cellular factor to inhibit an antiviral response. In this case, the target is protein kinase R (PKR), a cellular protein that binds to the long dsRNAs produced by adenoviruses and many other pathogenic viruses. Binding of dsRNA by PKR induces PKR dimerization and autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of cellular eIF2\u03b1, which results in a global inhibition of translation in the infected host cell. VA1, a highly structured ~160 nt-long noncoding RNA, binds to PKR with high affinity and blocks PKR dimerization and activation. This prevents the inhibition of translation induced by adenovirus-derived dsRNAs and allows virus replication to proceed unimpeded (Mathews and Shenk, 1991) . Interestingly, both hCMV \u03b22.7 and adenovirus VA1, like KSHV PAN and HSV-1 LAT, are also expressed at high levels in infected cells. \u03b22.7 comprises up to 20% of all viral transcripts in hCMV-infected cells, and adenovirus VA1 is expressed at an extraordinarily high number of copies (~10 8 ) per infected cell. Presumably, these high expression levels facilitate the saturation of cellular binding sites for these RNAs.",

For the majority of cellular mRNAs, it is initiated by the recruitment of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F to the mRNA 5\u2032 cap(Martinez-Salas et al., 2008) (see Review by N. Sonenberg and A.G. Hinnebusch in this issue of Cell). eIF4F consists of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the RNA helicase eIF4A, and a third protein, eIF4G. The role of eIF4G is to facilitate recruitment of the 43S preinitiation complex, consisting of the 40S ribosomal subunit, found in a complex with the initiator methionine tRNA (Met-tRNAi) and other eIFs, to the mRNA cap. Once recruited to the cap, the 40S subunit then scans along the mRNA searching for the translation initiation codon. At this point, the 60S ribosomal subunit is also recruited and translation initiation occurs(Martinez-Salas et al., 2008).",
