Films consisting primarily of insulators are not considered here, except to the extent that they may be used to form patterned arrays or electrodes with special geometries. A view of applications and properties of film electrodes as well as the methodologies used in their fabrication is given by Anderson and Winograd [1] .",

The immobilisation method will determine the sensitivity and reproducibility of the genosensor. Several strategies for the immobilisation of ssDNA have been carried out and will be discussed later. The ssDNA probe immobilised on the transducer surface recognises its complementary (target) DNA sequence via hybridisation. The DNA duplex is then converted into an analytical signal by the transducer. Different strategies for electrochemical detection have been performed. One of them is based on label-free electrochemical detection, via the intrinsic electrochemical behaviour of DNA, through guanine or adenine nucleotides. However, most of the strategies are based on the use of indicators or labels. The first ones are based on the differences in the electrochemical behaviour of indicators that interact in a distinct extension with double-strand DNA (dsDNA) and ssDNA. The indicators for hybridisation detection can be anticancer agents, organic dyes or metal complexes. The latter strategies include the use of labels such as ferrocene, enzymes or metal nanoparticles.",

Evaporation is most commonly initiated by melting the metal onto a conductive support, which may be a filament or boat, usually tungsten or tantalum, followed by further electrical heating of the metal to its melting point. Alternatively, higher-melting metals can be successfully evaporated using electron-beam heating techniques [11, 12, 14] .",

To obtain discontinuous films with different geometries, as gold arrays or electrodes with circular geometry with sizes on the order of 10 mm, it is necessary to combine these methods with microlithographic methods. In these methods, the device to be fabricated is coated with a photosensitive polymeric coating, which is baked and then exposed to a light source through a mask or a sequence of masks. The masks are designed using computer-aided design, and are typically produced by covering a metal film (e.g., chromium) on a highquality glass plate with negative photoresist, exposing and developing the resist and then etching the metal to reveal the desired pattern. Masks may be positive or negative. Positive masks block light whereas negative masks transmit light. The photoresists can also be classified as positive and negative. The positive photoresist is initially polymerised and is then depolymerised and made soluble where light strikes it, whereas the negative photoresist is initially soluble but rendered insoluble at points that have been photopolymerised by exposure to light.",

            "text": "With respect to thick-film electrodes, the screen-printing technology is the most common method used to fabricate genosensor devices. The electrodes obtained with this technology are usually called screenprinted electrodes (SPEs). Most of them are carbon thick film [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , although gold thick films are also used [36, 37] . The screen-printing technology has become increasingly popular recently for the fabrication of electrodes and complete cells for applications where a disposable, one-time-use electrochemical measurement is desired. Masking patterns are photographically exposed and developed on an emulsion applied to a fine screen whose mesh is open in zones where ink (gold, carbon, silver or Ag/AgCl) is not to be applied. Pastes or inks are then forced by means of a semiflexible squeegee blade through the masking screen onto the substrate to create the film electrode assembly. The finished assembly is then treated according to the type of electrode desired. In some cases (metal electrodes), the inks are fired to form the electrode. In other cases (carbon films), the electrodes are ready as soon as the solvent has evaporated and the film has dried. The most common substrates used to fabricate these SPEs are aluminium ceramic [16] [17] [18] , polyester flexible film [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] 36, 37] and polycarbonate sheet [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .",

The immobilisation method will determine the sensitivity and reproducibility of the genosensor. Several strategies for the immobilisation of ssDNA have been carried out and the strategy selected to immobilise the ssDNA probe depends, in many cases, on the nature of the electrode surface. The strategies for the immobilisation of ssDNA probes on solid surfaces include adsorption at controlled potential usually on pretreated screen-printed carbon surfaces [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] 29] . However, in these cases, the immobilised ssDNA probes are not totally accessible for hybridisation, resulting in poor hybridisation efficiency. Moreover, in these cases, no blocking step is carried out and the background signals obtained in many cases are important.",

Moreover, the ssDNA probes are oriented in the genosensing phase, leaving the probes accessible for the reaction with their complementary targets.

In these cases, the thiolated probes, thiolated peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) [15] or an adequate thiolated primer (used to carry out PCR amplification on electrode surface [10] ) form an ordered selfassembled monolayer on the gold surface. In these cases, a blocking step with a sulphur-containing compound is carried out to avoid the background signals. Other strategies are based on the formation of a polymer, through the electropolymerisation of a monomer-modified ssDNA probe [3] on the electrode surface, through the electropolymerisation of a monomer and subsequently covalent attachment of the amino modified ssDNA probe or through the copolymerisation of the monomer in the presence of ssDNA probe [2, 24, 25, 35] . The avidin-biotin interaction to attach biotinylated ssDNA probes on the electrode surface has also been used to obtain genosensing phases [19, 23, 27, 28, 30, 31, 34] .",

One of them is based on label-free electrochemical detection, via the intrinsic electrochemical behaviour of DNA, through guanine or adenine nucleotides. However, most of the strategies are based on the use of indicators or labels. The first ones are based on the differences in the electrochemical behaviour of indicators with dsDNA and ssDNA. The indicators for hybridisation detection can be anticancer agents, organic dyes or metal complexes. The latter strategies are the use of labels as ferrocene, enzymes or metal nanoparticles. Table 26 .1 shows the most common methods followed to detect the hybridisation event using thick-and thin-film electrodes found in the literature.",

Schems d 1 and d 2 have been recently developed. The scheme used to detect the hybridisation event depends mainly on the method employed to obtain the analytical signal. Thus, scheme a is used when label-free methods, with or without indicators, are employed to obtain the analytical signal. In this scheme the unlabelled ssDNA target is hybridised with capture probe immobilised on the electrode surface and then the detection is carried out via guanine oxidation or via the oxidation or reduction of the indicator. Schemes b and c are performed when labels are used to obtain the analytical signal. In the former scheme (scheme b) the labelled ssDNA target is hybridised with capture probe immobilised on the electrode surface and then the detection is carried out in an adequate manner. For this purpose, the labelling of ssDNA target is carried out by PCR amplification using a labelled primer or by the use of labelling kits, e.g., the Universal Linkage System (ULS). In the latter scheme (scheme c), called ''sandwich'', a first hybridisation step is carried out between the unlabelled ssDNA target and capture probe immobilised on the electrode surface followed by a second hybridisation with a labelled synthetic oligonucleotide (detector probe) complementary to other region of ssDNA target (different to capture probe). Finally, the detection of the label is carried out in an adequate manner. The main advantage of this scheme is that DNA-labelling procedures are avoided. Finally, in schemes d 1 and d 2 the label is on the electrode surface. The first scheme is called reagentless and the second one is named quasi-reagentless. In the first one, the unlabelled ssDNA target is hybridised with a ferrocene-labelled hairpin capture probe immobilised on the electrode surface [43] . In the hairpin form, the redox-active ferrocene is close to the electrode surface and undergoes oxidation. Hybridisation of the loop region to the target disrupts the hairpin, increasing the distance from the redox-active ferrocene to the electrode surface and thereby lowering the electrochemical signal. The impressive characteristic of the response is the dynamic range, which spans six orders of magnitude of the DNA concentration. Although this broad dynamic range is useful in some applications, the sensitivity of the method (the percentage change per increment of input concentration) is correspondingly less marked, making this scheme more suitable for applications such as the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) or the detection of pathogens, in which reading small changes in input concentration is less important (than it is in expression analysis).",

            "text": "In label-free systems, the nucleobases inside dsDNA are oxidised to a lesser extent than those in the resulting ssDNA and a decrease in the analytical signal after the hybridisation should be expected. The analytical signal diminishes relative to the signal from the ssDNA probe as the duplex is formed but at the same time as new electroactive bases are added within the target, its contribution to the increase in the analytical signal must be taken into account. Because of these opposite trends, nonlinear calibration curves are often obtained. The alternative is to use guanine-free probes. In these probes guanine is substituted for inosine, which binds preferentially to cytosine and its oxidation process is far removed from that of guanine [22, 29] . The signal now appears on hybridisation and background signals are negligible. An other strategy to increase the differences between analytical signals obtained for ssDNA and dsDNA based on guanine oxidation has been developed recently [32] . It consists of the use of a single-strand DNA-binding protein (SSB). This protein binds selectively to ssDNA. The guanine oxidation is hampered when ssDNA probe is bound to SSB but when the hybridisation event is carried out, the SSB does not bind to dsDNA and the guanines oxidation is recorded. Methods based on oxidation of bases are attractive because they are label-free, rapid and the most simple ( Fig. 26.1a ). Oxidation of guanine at thick-and thin-film electrodes requires high-applied potentials and the associated high background currents must be subtracted to reach competitive detection limits using potentiometric stripping analysis. Another strategy employed to increase signal-to-noise ratio is the use of ruthenium or osmium complexes that act as mediators of the oxidation of guanine, increasing the rate of electron transfer between the nucleic acid and the electrode and enhancing the oxidation signal.",

Electrochemical hybridisation indicators are electroactive compounds with different affinities for ssDNA relative to dsDNA. Three modes of binding of small molecules to DNA are normally described: electrostatic interaction, groove binding and intercalation. Because grooves are formed only within the double helix, groovebinders as Hoescht 33258 have greater affinity for dsDNA than ssDNA and thereby when hybridisation event takes places the oxidation peak of the indicator increases. Other indicators, such as daunomycin, cobalt complex and ferrocenyl-naphtalene diimide (FND), act as intercalators. Shifts in the peak potential or area of the oxidation process of daunomycin on dsDNA when compared to that obtained with ssDNA have been successfully used as electrochemical signals [19, 20] . The treading intercalator FND has higher duplex affinity and binding stability and the ferrocene oxidation increases when duplex DNA is formed. With respect to methylene blue (MB), an other indicator, this compound gives lower signals for duplex DNA than those obtained for ssDNA, because the specific interaction of MB with guanine bases is prevented in the duplex and then the reduction peak of MB decreases.",

The complex ''platinum-label'', so obtained, is monofunctional, that is, the other end of the complex finishes in one Cl, through which the attachment of the complex to the oligonucleotide takes place. The Cl is substituted by the N7 position of the guanines of the oligonucleotides in a very simple labelling reaction that takes not more than 35 min. The analytical signal is obtained from platinum (II) complex, which is deposited on the electrode surface. In the presence of platinum on the electrode surface and after fixing an adequate potential in acidic medium, the protons are catalytically reduced to hydrogen. The current generated by this catalytic reduction can be measured and increases with platinum concentration and consequently with labelled target concentration following scheme b.",

Moreover, because routine laboratories are usually working with enzymatic labels, this might make them the most attractive labels for implementation of DNA diagnosis in such laboratories. The signal normally arises from a redox process of a product of the enzymatic reaction (Table 26.1) . However, in other cases the analytical signal is not based on the redox process of the enzymatic product. Thus, Kwak et al. [14] use a biometallisation process where a nonelectroactive substrate (p-aminophenyl phosphate) is enzymatically converted into the reducing agent p-aminophenol that reduces Ag + ions leading to deposition of the metal onto electrode surface. In this case, the oxidation peak of deposited Ag is recorded. Mascini et al. [37] use the alkaline phosphatase substrate BCIP/NBT that after the enzymatic reaction generates an insoluble and insulating product on the sensing phase that blocks the electrical communication between the electrode surface and the Fe(CN) 6 3\u00c0/4\u00c0 pair. In this case, faradaic impedance spectroscopy is finally used to detect the enhanced electron-transfer resistance.",

It consists of denaturing the dsDNA thermally by using a boiling water bath for sometime and then immersing the tube containing the denaturalised DNA in an icewater bath for a short time in order to retard the re-annealing of the strands. Although the denaturalisation is achieved, one drawback of this procedure is that the sister strand can compete with capture probe by target strand. -Asymmetric PCR. Some authors used this procedure to obtain ssDNA targets [39, 40, 48] . It consists of a PCR amplification with one of the primers in excess compared with the other one. In this way, the target strand of interest is in excess compared with the sister strand, thus favouring binding at the capture probe as opposed to sister strand reannealing. When the amount of DNA from the sample is enough to detect on the genosensor device without a PCR amplification, this procedure is not used. -Alkaline treatment. Some authors have used this procedure [26, 27, 48] . It consists of adding to DNA an alkaline solution (e.g., 0.5 M NaOH solution). An increase in pH affects the ionisation of the functional groups of bases implied in the hydrogen bonds, thus decreasing the number of these bonds between the strands. It is a rapid and simple method.",

Exonucleases are enzymes that hydrolyse the terminal phosphodiester bonds of DNA strands obtaining mononucleosides monophosphate or biphosphate. In this case a 5 0 -exonuclease that hydrolyses the 5 0 -end phosphodiester is used. In this way, the strands are destroyed. To achieve the total hydrolysis of the sister strand, the target strand must be protected, for example, by a label at its 5 0 -end. Therefore, the PCR amplification is carried out using one of the primers biotinylated at the 5 0 -end and the other one modified at its 5 0 -end with a phosphate group. The extension of these primers give rise to the 5 0 -biotinylated target DNA strand and a 5 0 -phosphate sister DNA strand, which is hydrolysed by 5 0 -exonuclease.",

The control of the experimental variables that affect the hybridisation event is very important in order to obtain an efficient and selective hybridisation. The detection of SNP or genetic mutations requires an efficient discrimination between mismatched and complementary strands. In most of the cases, the selectivity relies on the operating conditions of the assay as hybridisation buffer composition, hybridisation time and hybridisation temperature. One way to obtain discrimination between mismatched and complementary strands is the use of high temperatures during the hybridisation reaction. The difference in the melting curves of the target from perfectly matched and mismatched capture probes can allow to define a specific temperature to discriminate perfect matches and mismatches. However, the employment of high temperatures during hybridisation step requires precise temperature control, which is difficult to achieve and is expensive [48] .",

The presence of ions in DNA solutions stabilises the DNA duplex because they diminish the electrostatic repulsion between phosphate groups of the strands and therefore facilitate the approximation between both strands. If the ionic strength is decreased, only complementary hybrids can be formed. Chemical agents with amino and carbonyl groups in their structure such as formamide or urea present in the hybridisation solution compete with nucleotide bases for hydrogen bonds formation, facilitating the DNA duplex destabilisation and strands separation and achieving discrimination between mismatched and complementary strands. The addition of these chemical agents to obtain more stringent conditions and therefore the discrimination of single-mismatched strand has been used by several authors [9, 30, 31, 36] .",

They combine the use of DNA ligase enzyme and A-PCR with one of the primer (called special primer by authors) containing a Tag sequence at its 5 0 -end. The Tag sequence is complementary to the genomic region between the mutation point and the special primer. Since the A-PCR products contain self-complementary sequences, they form a self-loop. The capture probes are attached to the electrode surface by their 5 0 -end. The wildtype probe (W probe) has the same nucleotide as the wild-type genome at the 3 0 -end and the mutant-type probe (M probe) has the same nucleotide as the mutant-type genome. When the A-PCR product is hybridised with the W probe or the M probe, the ligase enzyme recognises the matched or unmatched nucleotide pair at the 3 0 -end of the probe. If the 3 0 -end nucleotide is complementary (or matched), the enzyme repairs the nick between the 3 0 -end of the probe and the 5 0 -end of the A-PCR product. As a result, the probe and the A-PCR product become one molecule. However, if the last nucleotide is not complementary (or is mismatched), the enzyme does not repair the nick and the probe and the A-PCR product remain as two different molecules. After a denaturation step, if the enzyme repairs the nick, the probe and the A-PCR product are not separated and then FND (intercalator) is detected; but if the enzyme does not repair the nick, the probe and the A-PCR product are separated and then FND is not detected.",

A comparison between the signals obtained for background and immobilised DNA (double labelled with biotin and thiol) when BSA and 1-hexanethiol were employed as blocking agents is shown in Fig. 26.4 . It can be observed that the background with albumin is negligible and the S/B ratio is high (22.4) , but the DNA signal is better defined for 1-hexanethiol where the capacitively current approaches zero. Moreover, when the Thick-and thin-film DNA sensors hybridisation step was carried out the S/B ratio obtained for albumin was much lower than that obtained with a double-labelled DNA strand.

Hybridisation studies carried out between 30-mer strands were compared with those for 40-mer oligonucleotides. The length of the strand influences the hybridisation in such a way that higher signals are obtained and lower discrimination is achieved when the number of oligonucleotides increases. Experiences with crossed strands (immobilised 40-mer strand that hybridises with a 30-mer target and vice versa, hybrids between immobilised 30-mer strand and a 40-mer one) revealed the importance of an oligonucleotide tail in the immobilised strand for favouring the mobility and therefore the hybridisation.

Detection limits of 5 and 70 pM were, respectively, obtained. determinants exclusively present in the genome of the pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. Orientation of the strands in the sensing phase is achieved by modifying the surface of the electrode with streptavidin by physical adsorption followed by the immobilisation of biotinylated oligo probes. The physical adsorption of streptavidin must be performed at a constant temperature above the room temperature. Moreover, the electrode surface must be previously electrochemically pretreated at an anodic potential in acidic medium to improve its adsorptive properties. In this way, reproducible, sensitive and stable sensing phases are obtained [54] . The biotinylated oligo nucleic acid probes used in this work target the pneumolysin (ply) gene. This target is randomly labelled with the Universal Linkage System (ULS s ). This labelling system consists of the use of a platinum (II) complex that acts as a coupling agent between DNA strands and a label molecule, usually fluorescent. This platinum complex is a monofunctional derivate of cisplatin (a potent anticancer agent used in the treatment of a variety of tumours) that binds to DNA at the N7 position of guanine with release of one Cl \u00c0 ion per molecule of the complex. The label molecule used in this study was fluorescein (FITC). Electrochemical detection is achieved using two strategies. One of them is carried out using an anti-FITC alkaline phosphatase-labelled antibody and 3-indoxyl phosphate (3-IP) as enzymatic substrate of AP. The resulting enzymatic product is indigo blue, an aromatic heterocycle insoluble in aqueous solutions. Its sulfonation in acidic medium gives rise to IC, an aqueous soluble compound that shows an electrochemical behaviour similar to indigo blue. Both 3-IP and IC have already been studied on SPCEs [55, 56] . However, although these genosensors are stable and sensitive devices for the detection of specific nucleic acid fragments, the need of two additional steps to obtain the analytical signal resulted in a large timeconsuming analysis. This fact can be avoided using the second strategy for detection. In this case the analytical signal is directly obtained from platinum (II) complex, which is deposited on the electrode surface. In presence of the platinum on the electrode surface and after fixing an adequate potential in acidic medium, the protons are catalytically reduced to hydrogen. The current generated by this catalytic reduction can be measured and increases with platinum concentration and consequently with labelled target concentration.",

The electrode surface must be pretreated by applying an anodic constant current (+3.0 mA) in 0.1 M H 2 SO 4 for 2 min to improve its adsorptive properties. The use of this electrochemical pretreatment resulted in an increase in the hydrophilicity of the transducer, allowing the adsorption of streptavidin through hydrophilic and electrostatic attraction. In order to avoid repeatability problems associated to the use of streptavidin, the adsorption of streptavidin on the electrode must be performed at 41C overnight. Doing this, repeatable signals are obtained and the streptavidin coated SPCEs are stable for months if they are stored at 41C. Moreover, the significance of the attachment of biotinylated oligonucleotide probes through the streptavidin/biotin interaction has been tested in a previous work [30] . When a double-labelled (biotin and fluorescein) poly-T was attached to the electrode surface through the streptavidin/biotin interaction, the peak currents were much higher than those obtained when it was accumulated on the electrode surface by physical adsorption. This fact means that streptavidin/biotin interaction allows to attach and orient the oligonucleotide strands on electrode surface, whereas the direct adsorption of the oligonucleotide on the electrode surface results in very poor manner. Using this method of immobilisation of the oligonucleotide probes, the genosensor devices are stable for a year if they are stored at 41C.",

Although enough sensitivity to avoid PCR amplification has been achieved by use of enzymatic labels [12, 14, 26, 28] or metal tags [42] , most of the assays routinely start with a PCR or other biochemical amplification. Moreover, although label-free formats are used, most of the strategies followed to obtain the analytical signal involve several washing steps and need the use of labelled reagents (or labelling procedures) or indicators, which complicates the assay performance. Motorola Science has commercialised the eSensor [39, 40] , which detects the hybridisation of the target by a sandwich assay without cleanup steps. Although this sensor requires the addition of reagents, they are included in the microsystem as dry reagents dissolved by the sample. An important drawback is the need of carrying out DNA isolation and purification before testing the DNA sample with genosensor devices due to the inherent complexity associated with the biological sample. The real goal, for specific pathogen detection, is the development of an assay involving rapid DNA isolation with the detection of few copies in half an hour or less. With these electrochemical genosensors this goal is reliable, but it has not yet been achieved.",

However, the fluorescence-based readout of these chips involves not only highly precise and expensive instrumentation but also sophisticated numerical algorithms to interpret the data, and therefore these methods have been commonly limited to use in research laboratories. In this way, thin-film arrays of 14, 20, 25, 48 and 64 electrodes have already been fabricated [12, 15, 39, 40, 44, 48] , using lithographic techniques.
