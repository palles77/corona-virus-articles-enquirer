            "text": "Purification of recombinant proteins is often a challenging process involving several chromatographic steps that must be optimized for each target protein. Here, we developed a self-excising module allowing single-step affinity chromatography purification of untagged recombinant proteins. It consists of a 250-residue-long self-processing module of the Neisseria meningitidis FrpC protein with a C-terminal affinity tag. The N terminus of the module is fused to the C terminus of a target protein of interest. Upon binding of the fusion protein to an affinity matrix from cell lysate and washing out contaminating proteins, site-specific cleavage of the Asp-Pro bond linking the target protein to the self-excising module is induced by calcium ions. This results in the release of the target protein with only a single aspartic acid residue added at the C terminus, while the self-excising affinity module remains trapped on the affinity matrix. The system was successfully tested with several target proteins, including glutathione-S-transferase, maltose-binding protein, b-galactosidase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, and adenylate cyclase, and two different affinity tags, chitin-binding domain or poly-His. Moreover, it was demonstrated that it can be applied as an alternative to two currently existing systems, based on the self-splicing intein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and sortase A of Staphylococcus aureus.",

The drawback of all of these systems, however, is that the affinity tag usually has to be removed prior to biochemical or biological activity characterization, crystallization, or use in antibody production. Therefore, a specific cleavage site is engineered between the affinity tag and the protein of interest and the tag is cleaved off by treatment with a site-specific protease (Nilsson et al. 1997; Jenny et al. 2003; Arnau et al. 2006 ). This approach, however, suffers several limitations: (1) separation of the protein of interest from the affinity tag, the unprocessed fusion, and the added protease typically requires an extra purification step; (2) the used proteases (e.g., factor Xa, enterokinase, or thrombin) are not fully specific and may cleave additional bonds within the target protein; (3) the cleavage site in the fusion protein may be inaccessible to the protease; (4) the cleavage of the fusion usually requires long reaction times; and (5) the process is rather costly.",

These consist of a self-processing module that is genetically fused at one terminus to an affinity tag, enabling simple one-step purification, and at the second terminus to a protein of interest. After binding of the fusion protein to an affinity matrix and washing out of contaminating proteins, the cleavage activity of the self-processing module is induced by a low-molecular weight compound, resulting in release of the protein of interest, while the self-processing module-affinity tag remains trapped on the matrix. A suitable self-processing module has to fulfill two basic conditions: (1) It must undergo cleavage only at the specific peptide bond between the protein of interest and the self-processing module-affinity tag, and (2) it must cleave off only after induction in vitro and not inside of the producing organism. Therefore, selfprocessing modules matching these requirements are rare; only two types of such self-cleaving affinity tags have been reported. One is based on a self-splicing protein element of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, called intein (Chong et al. 1997) , and the other utilizes the catalytic core of sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus (Mao 2004) .",

We therefore reasoned that the SPM might be useful in constructing self-cleaving affinity tags (Fig. 1B ). An obstacle to its use, however, appeared to consist in some reactivity of carboxyl groups of the C-terminal Asp 414 residues released by SPM-mediated cleavage, as these were observed to form covalent isopeptide bonds with Figure 1 . Schemes of the FrpC protein and a recombinant protein purification based on the self-processing module of FrpC.

            "text": "It has been described that some proteases are not able to cleave a peptide bond when certain amino acid residues are placed N-terminally adjacent to the cleavage site (Shuker et al. 2003; Chu et al. 2006) . Similarly, the intein-based self-cleaving affinity tag is not able to efficiently cleave the peptide bond between a protein of interest and intein, when an asparagine, cysteine, or proline residue (Xxx) is immediately linked to the cysteine residue of the cleaved Xxx/Cys bond (see, IMPACT-CN instruction manual at www.neb.com). Here, different recombinant proteins of interest were fused in-frame with SPM, having their Cterminal residue (alanine, glutamate, histidine, serine, tryptophan, tyrosine, or valine) directly fused to the cleaved Asp-Pro bond of SPM. All constructed fusions were found to be efficiently cleaved by SPM, suggesting that those residues are allowed in the given position and that their presence has no negative effect on the SPM-mediated cleavage of the fusion proteins. It also confirms that no To compare the efficiencies of the SPM-and intein-based purification systems, a catalytically active adenylate cyclase domain of the adenylate cyclase toxin of B. pertussis was used as a reporter protein to monitor all purification steps. The amounts of AC-SPM-CBD and AC-intein-CBD in the crude cytosolic extracts were taken as 100% and the protein amounts in all other purification fractions were then expressed as a percentage of this total protein quantity. The values represent an average of three independent determinations 6 standard deviation. The values represent an average of three independent determinations 6 standard deviation. extra residues from the original FrpC sequence adjacent Nterminally to the Asp-Pro cleavage site are necessary for self-processing activity of SPM. Moreover, SPM demonstrated strong specificity only for the Asp-Pro cleavage site localized at the N terminus of SPM, and it was not able to nonspecifically cleave Asp-Pro bonds occurring in proteins of interest that were fused to SPM (an Asp-Pro bond occurred once in GST, once in MalE, and four times in LacZ). Moreover, due to the high cleavage specificity of SPM, the released proteins of interest should all have a homogeneous C terminus. This was indeed demonstrated for the AC protein that was, after SPM-mediated cleavage of the AC-SPM-CBD fusion, extensively analyzed by mass spectrometry. We have recently proposed a possible reaction scheme of processing and cross-linking of FrpC (Osicka et al. 2004) , in which binding of calcium ions to SPM of FrpC promotes a conformational change in the molecule that allows interaction of an as yet uncharacterized residue(s) of FrpC with Pro 415 and promotes its protonation (Fig. 6) . This subsequently promotes a nucleophilic attack of the b-carboxyl group of Asp 414 on the carbonyl carbon and rupture of the amide bond to Pro 415 . A reactive anhydride at Asp 414 could then form and either hydrolyze or get attacked by adjacent e-amino groups of another protein molecule to form a new isopeptide Asp-Lys amide bond (Fig. 6) .",

However, when the same proteins were bound and processed on an affinity matrix, much higher yields of the eluted GST or MalE protein were obtained when the immobilized fusion proteins were cleaved in the presence of 10 mM DTT (data not shown). This suggests that the cross-linking activity upon SPM-mediated cleavage was highly increased when the fusion proteins were concentrated on the surface of affinity beads. Hence, to avoid trapping of the proteins of interest on the column by cross-linking to the immobilized self-cleaving affinity tags, the cleavage reaction of immobilized proteins should always be performed in the presence of thiol compounds.",

Similarly to the SPM-based purification system, DTT is hydrolyzed from a released protein after intein-catalyzed processing of a fusion protein, while cysteine remains covalently bound to its C terminus (Chong et al. 1997) . This observation was also confirmed here by high-resolution mass spectrometric analysis of the trypsinized AC protein released upon the intein-mediated cleavage of the AC-intein-CBD fusion (Supplemental Table 1 ). However, in contrast to the intein-based purification system, in which the cleavage of fusion proteins can be also induced by hydroxylamine, the SPM-based system is not able to utilize primary amines (such as methylamine or ethylamine) for blocking of the cross-linking reaction that ensues SPM-mediated cleavage of the fusion proteins (data not shown). Hence, primary amines were able to induce the intein-mediated cleavage, but did not compete with the adjacent e-amino groups of internal lysine residues of the fusion proteins to inhibit the cross-linking reaction. The tryptic fragment not matching any of the masses in the theoretical AC digest was detected in one of the peptide fractions at m/z 1496.7, and its structure was determined from the PSD daughter ion spectra.

Proposed mechanism of the SPM-mediated cleavage of the Asp-Pro bond of a fusion protein and of the inhibition of the subsequent cross-linking reaction by thiol compounds. Upon calcium binding, the b-carboxyl group of Asp would initiate a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the amide bond with Pro, resulting in an unstable intermediate and disruption of the peptide bond with subsequent formation of a reactive Asp anhydride at the C terminus of the released protein of interest. This can be attacked at the carboxyl carbon of the anhydride ring by the free e-amino group of a lysine residue of the SPM-based self-cleaving affinity tag, leading to formation of an amide (isopeptide) bond with either aor b-carboxyl of the Asp residue (only reaction with a-carboxyl is shown) (A). This cross-linking reaction can be efficiently blocked by DTT, the free thiol group of which attacks the carboxyl carbon of the anhydride ring with higher efficiency than e-amino group of lysine residue (B). A similar reaction occurs when cysteine is used instead of DTT (C). However, while DTT is subsequently hydrolyzed from the aspartate (B), cysteine undergoes a spontaneous S-N acyl shift that results in formation of a peptide bond between aspartate and cysteine (C).",
