Whilst the problems in obtaining data and in assessing the quality of data that could be obtained were formidable, two conclusions can be safely drawn. First, there is great variation in coverage of HIV-related services for IDUs across diff erent countries; and second, in much of the world, coverage is clearly inadequate.",

Over the past 25 years, several useful theories have been developed for changing the health behaviour of IDUs and others at high risk for HIV. It may be time to apply those theories to changing the behaviour of policy makers.",

These theories articulate how new behaviours spread through social systems and how individuals in these systems infl uence each other to either adopt (or resist) new behaviours. 4,5 These theories have been applied in IDU interventions developed by many diff erent researchers and have the major advantage of often producing self-sustaining behavioural changes in the IDU community. Applying these theories to changing the behaviour of national policy makers raises interesting questions. Is the policy-making system relatively open or relatively closed to innovations? Is the policy-making system highly centralised (one decision centre) or decentralised (multiple decision centres)? Who might become the early adopters and serve as models or opinion leaders for others in the system? The answers to such questions would provide guidance about initiating system change.",

            "text": "The second theory is contingency management. This theory comes from basic behaviourism theory. 6,7 If you want to increase the frequency with which an individual performs a specifi c behaviour, provide a reward when Syringe-exchange programmes in which a drug user is given a new sterile syringe for bringing in a used and potentially contaminated syringe might be the most common example of contingency management to reduce HIV transmission. Within behaviour theory, onefor-one reinforcement is typically not the most eff ective schedule for behavioural change. For syringe exchange, the maximum reductions in risk behaviour seem to occur when drug users are provided with suffi cient numbers of syringes to meet their own needs, and they obtain extra syringes which can then be given to peers, leading to additional social reinforcement. Syringeexchange programmes typically have many services in addition to basic exchange, 8 which serve as additional reinforcers. Who would provide what sort of reward to political leaders for implementing HIV services for IDUs? The reward of averting large numbers of HIV infections in IDUs is certainly important, but is not consistent with a primary principle of contingency management: that rewards should be given immediately after performance of the desired behaviour. International donors, however, could require that evidence-based services for IDUs be included in national plans to address HIV for a country to receive any HIV prevention and treatment resources. The Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has adopted this approach, although, as shown by Mathers and colleagues, there is a need for better follow-through to ensure that appropriate resources are actually provided to IDUs, particularly for antiretroviral therapy.",

            "text": "HIV continues to spread among IDUs in many diff erent countries, and the need for scaling up prevention and treatment is urgent. Although theorybased policy-implementation interventions need to be adapted to local situations, we suggest that contingency management and framing the issue in community health-economic terms might be the most useful for immediate policy change. Long-term sustained eff orts to protect the health of individuals who use both licit and illicit drugs might require that policy makers acquire a basic scientifi c understanding of drug use and addiction, and frame policies toward drug users within a public health and human rights perspective. 12 The vaccine was incorporated into the CDC's Vaccines for Children Program at the same time. Some public health professionals speculated that the vaccine's rapid FDA approval and lightning-fast inclusion in CDC programmes would be followed by a colossal failure in the delivery system. 2 Specifi cally, although the vaccine's greatest potential clearly lies in the benefi ts it could confer on girls who face a high risk of cervical cancer, public health experts anticipated that the vaccine would mostly go to girls at low risk of the disease. The groups of girls more and less likely to benefi t from HPV vaccination can be readily distinguished in the USA. Those who are poor and have restricted access to regular Pap testing (and the follow-up assessments and treatments that it triggers) are at high risk of invasive cervical cancer. Those who are more affl uent and have access to regular Pap testing are at low risk of the disease because the test, when properly done, is highly eff ective. 3 Cervical cancer burden diff ers greatly between these two groups. In the fairly poor state of Mississippi (median annual household income US$36 674), the ageadjusted cervical cancer mortality rate is 3\u00b76 per 100 000. In Rhode Island, which is a wealthy state (median $55 980), the cervical cancer mortality rate is 50% lower (1\u00b78 per 100 000). Were the vaccine to mostly go to girls in states such as Rhode Island rather than those in Mississippi, such a pattern would not only fail to match ",
