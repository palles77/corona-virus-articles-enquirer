The hallmarks of the regulated secretory pathway are first that the postGolgi secretory granules fuse with the plasma membrane only after the cell has received a specific, external signal that triggers secretion. The signal involves the binding of a secretagog to the plasma membrane followed by signal transduction to the interior of the cell. The second characteristic of the regulated pathway is that only a subset of the cell's total complement of secretory proteins enters it. In other words, the regulated secretory proteins must be sorted from the constitutively secreted proteins in the 118 Tooze same cell.

In endocrine cells, where does the primary translation product undergo specific proteolytic cleavage(s) to produce the mature hormones? Inparticular, does cleavage precede the sorting and packaging into dense core secretory granules, or does it occur afterwards? Obviously, if cleavage precedes sorting and packaging, the complexity of the sorting event is increased, since the multiple products, instead of a single precursor, have to be sorted. We approached this question using AtT20 cells in which POMC is cleaved to yield ACTH and other hormones. We (4) raised an antibody against a short synthetic peptide with a sequence corresponding to the sequence around one of the P O M C cleavage sites (Fig. 6) . After cleavage the two basic amino acids in the middle of this sequence are removed, which means the epitope must be destroyed. This antibody, as expected, recognized POMC, but not A C T H (Fig. 7) .

Endocytosis of many species of ligands at the plasma membrane involves specific receptors, which may or may not recycle. By analogy with these events, it has been suggested that membrane-bound receptors in the TGN, and immature secretory granules budded from it, might be responsible for sorting regulated secretory proteins from constitutively secreted proteins and delivering the former to regulated secretory granules. Basically, this model envisages binding of regulated secretory protein in the TGN, clustering of receptor-ligand complexes, budding of the immature secretory granule, and recycling of the receptor from the detached secretory granule back to the TGN. Since in endocrine cells, at least, the pH of the granule is lower than that of the TGN, by analogy with the mannose-6-phosphate receptor, one can postulate that the affinity of the putative sorting receptor for the ligand is high at the pH of the TGN and low at the pH of the granule. In exocrine pancreas, the zymogen granules have a higher pH than condensing vacuoles, if DAMP labeling is a reliable indicator of intracellular pH. In the case of the exocrine pancreas, one would have to argue that the receptor had lower affinity at higher pH.",

Moreover, as shown here, there is clathrin-coated vesicular transport of secretory protein. Clathrin is not, however, seen on 126 Tooze the surface of mature endocrine or exocrine secretory granules. There can be no doubt that clathrin-coated vesicles play some role in secretory granule formation, but there is still no clear indication of what that role really is. The presence of clathrin on the TGN and secretory granule membrane does not address the question of whether or not there are membrane-bound receptors for anything other than clathrin. To my mind, the receptor sorting hypothesis for the sorting events involved in the formation of secretory granules is, in its simplest form, wrong. The fundamental problem with this model is that it does not take account of the very large amounts of cargo protein to be sorted. Receptors in membranes are two-dimensional; they are a surface. The core of a secretory granule is a large volume of highly concentrated protein, so concentrated that it is osmotically inert out of solution. I do not believe a membrane-bound receptor, a twodimensional sheet, could have the capacity needed to fill the volume of a secretory granule core. Membrane-bound receptor-mediated sorting is able to sort proteins at low concentrations, e.g., lysosomal enzymes in the TGN or growth factor in the medium, but not the bulk sorting or regulated secretory proteins. Imagine fi lliug your car's petrol tank with 20 gallons of petrol, spread as a monolayer.To make a volume from a sheet, you laminate, as in a book, and secretory granules are not filled with laminated membrane; quite the opposite, they are spheres and use the minimum possible amount of membrane to envelope a given volume of precipitated protein.",

            "text": "Is there any evidence in favor of the condensation sorting model? Condensation of regulated secretory proteins can be seen in the EM normally in the TGN. However, as the work of Farquhar (7, 8) , Hopkins (9) , BroadweU and Oliver (10) , and others has shown, when endocrine cells are hyperstimulated, condensation occurs in earlier compartments of the pathway, in the c/s and medial Golgi, and even in the RER. As long ago as 1956, Palade (/1) reported intracisternal granules, interpreted as spheres of condensed secretory protein, in the RER of guinea pig exocrine pancreas. What all these observations tell us is that condensation of secretory proteins is not dependent on the environment of the TGN. It cannot, therefore, depend on receptors found only in effective concentration in the TGN and secretory granule membranes.",

            "text": "Recently Horst Kern, Kathryn Howell, Steve Fuller, and I (12) have shown that intracisternal granules in the RER of guinea pig pancreas (Fig. 10) contain the complete set of secreted proenzymes and enzymes that are found in zymogen granules. However, they did not include two abundant soluble resident RER proteins, heavy chain binding protein (BiP) and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Therefore, the formation of ICGs is a sorting event. Of course, ICGs are not zymogen granule'cores. First, most of the proteins in the ICGs are crosslinked by intermolecular disulfide bonds, rendering them completely insoluble in the absence of reducing agents, which is certainly not the case for zymogen granule cores. Second, the ICGs never progress down the exocytic pathway. When they I28 Tooze leave RER, they go to autophagic vacuoles. They are not secreted. Nevertheless, their formation is a sorting event, and it can occur in the environment of the RER. Likewise, in the RER of rat pancreas, amylase can crystallize in situ, and the crystals contain other zymogens, but not PDI and BiP. Crystallization is, of course, a condensation event in which the condensed molecules are packed in a regular array. In short, cocondensation of regulated secretory proteins can sort them from other soluble proteins in the same compartment, and there is ample evidence to show that cocondensation of these proteins is not restricted to the TGN even though that is its normal site.",

The granule membrane is clearly derived from regions of the membrane of TGN. As yet, we do not know how the membrane associates with the cargo proteins condensed in the cores, nor do we know how and when the specific protein composition of the granule membrane is achieved. There might well be a place for membrane-bound receptors in the TGN and immature granule membranes that recognize precipitated aggregates of secretory proteins. This in effect would involve the recognition of one surface, that of the spherical core, by a second surface, the TGN/immature granule membrane. Such receptors, if they exist, should not recognize monomeric secretory proteins. One can also postulate that the dathrin-coated vesicular transport from immature granules serves to remove inappropriate membrane proteins from the granule membrane. Finally, the secretory granule must include proteins able to cause fusion of the granule with the plasma membrane only after a signal is relayed following the binding of a fusogen to the plasma membrane. The molecules that allow constitutive fusion of constitutive secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane must be excluded from the membrane of regulated secretory granules or inactivated if they are present.",
