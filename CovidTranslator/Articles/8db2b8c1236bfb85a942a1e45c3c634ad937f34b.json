Aim of the study: To investigate the effect and mechanism of BHT in the prevention of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) fever in manners of immune modulation. Materials and methods: The model of fever syndrome of Chinese medicine pattern was imitated by LPS injection i.v. in rabbits, and BHT was gavaged. The serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL-6, 10) and immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, and IgM) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were tested by biochemical methods. Liver tissue damage was detected by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) stain. Subpopulation of T cells was detected by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS). Genes expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) in liver tissue were assayed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Result: The results demonstrated that BHT prevented sudden increase of IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, ALT and AST, and liver damage induced by LPS. BHT also prevented significant decrease of the percentage of CD 8+ T cells since LPS injection. At the same time, BHT did not affect the gene expression of TLR4 and serum concentration of three immunoglobulins, which were increased by LPS, but made gene expression of LBP higher. Conclusion: The results of this study indicated that BHT played an important role in immunity protection and anti-injury through preventing immunoinflammatory damage by LPS. The achievement thereby scientifically provided mechanism of BHT in the prevention of febrile disease, and supported its traditional use.",

Herbal medicine is one of the most essential elements of TCM, and Bai-Hu-Tang (or White Tiger Decoction) is a classical natural Chinese herbal formula with a long history of use. The formula originated from the treatise on febrile disease of Shang Han Lun (or Treatise on Cold-Attack) compiled by Zhong-Jing Zhang who lived in Eastern Han Dynasty in China. It was formulated with four herbs of Liquorice, Anemarrhena Rhizome, Gypsum and Rice, and mainly used to reduce fever and promote generation of body fluids (Charles, 2000; Zhu, 2007) . It was also useful in treating diabetes mellitus (Chen et al., 2008) , eczema, pruritus, some anxiety and emotional disorders (Herb Toxicities and Drug Interactions: A Formula Approach, 2004) .The formula has caused wide public concern over the recent years and practiced in many countries (European Herbal and Traditional Medicine Practitioners Association, 2007) , and even some international press also published works for user guide (Herb Toxicities and Drug Interactions: A Formula Approach, 2004). Therefore, the BHT is an important traditional Chinese formula that has been extensively used to prevent febrile disease in the world. But there was little basic theory report on its mechanism and effect.",

            "text": "Cytokines play an essential role in mediating interactions between cells of the immune system (Fletcher and Starr, 2005) . A sprinkling of cytokine can be specific responses to apart from infections and get transition into recovery, but an excessive cytokine production may cause the immune system out of control, and cause the precipitation of pathological consequences (Allison and Rosenthal, 2010) . Some diseases of fever, kidney dysfunction, and liver problem could be attributed to body's response to excessive cytokine production that storm physiology of the body, such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (Clark, 2007) . This virulent immune response with production of large amounts of inflammatory cytokines often was named as immunoinflammatory response, and played the most important role in the pathogenesis of liver damage and dysfunction (Seely and Christou, 2000; Wang and Ma, 2008; Aldridge et al., 2009) . The results demonstrated that liver pathological changes were observed significantly in LPS-treated animals, and the serum concentrations of ALT and AST, which were functional readout for liver damage, increased drastically in LPS injection animals, but decreased to normal level with BHT prevention (Fig. 3) . These changes were accompanied by changes of inflammatory cytokines, especially sudden change of IL-10 signaling (Fig. 2C ). There were no significant changes of other cytokines of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-\u03b3 (data not shown). This raised the intriguing possibility that excessive production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10 (Fig. 2) , which also caused excessive immune response, may be the direct cause of liver damage, and BHT was able to prevent the pathological process. Because the activation of the innate immune response can be a prerequisite for triggering of acquired immunity (Akira et al., 2001) , the adaptive immune system always works in synchronization with innate immunity (Abdelsadik and Trad, 2011) . Depending on the combination of cytokines produced in response to the stimulus, innate and adaptive immune responses are initiated. As reported, LPS-induced proliferation of lymphoid cells is thought to be primarily restricted to B cells in acquired immune (Tough et al., 1997) , and nearly all B cells require the help of Th cells before they can mature and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. The conventional T cells played a critical role in tempering the inflammatory response recognized by innate immune system (Kim et al., 2007) . In this study, the results of immunoglobulins and T cell subpopulations showed that humoral immunity mediated by B cells was activated by LPS without CD 4+ cell (Th cells) increase, but cell immunity carried out by CD 8+ cells (Tc cells) was inhibited by LPS. Due to the role of BHT, the CD 8+ cell decrease was prevented totally (Fig. 4B ), but enhanced humoral immunity was still kept at a high level (Fig. 4C-E) . Therefore, BHT did not affect the activated adaptive immunity, but prevented the cell immunity inhibition and excessive cytokines in innate immunity by LPS at the same time.",

            "text": "In addition to cytokines, an important role in innate immunity has been ascribed to TLR family (Lenert, 2006) . Different TLR recognizes the different pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on the effector cells of immunity system, such as TLR1 recognized lipoproteins, TLR3 recognized double-stranded RNA, and TLR4 recognized LPS (Akira et al., 2006; Kawai and Akira., 2011) . Actually, TLRs as main PRRs of immunity system played an important role in linking between rapid defense of innate immunity and delayed eradication of adaptive immunity (Werling and Jungi, 2003; Pasare and Medzhitov, 2004) . It was reported that TLR4 played an indispensable role in triggering LPS fever, and the phase of febrile response to LPS depended entirely on the TLR4 (Steiner et al., 2006) . Because LPS firstly arrived at liver that is the main LPS-processing and clearance organs after intravenous administration (Li and Blatteis, 2004 , it was ponderable to investigate expression of functional genes in liver. The gene expressions of TLR4 studied herein were not affected by BHT (Fig. 5A ), but LBP expression was increased (Fig. 5B) , which bind and transport LPS to activate cells in the immunity system (Knapp et al., 2006) , and inhibiting inflammatory response at higher concentration (Hamann et al., 2005) . This indicated that BHT may play an important role in avoiding excessive immunity, and the elevated expression of TLR4 may be beneficial for the initiation of the following adaptive immunity linked by TLR4.",
