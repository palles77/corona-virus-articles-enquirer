We present a route proposal that shows how the community pharmacist may develop his responsibility to contribute to the early detection and appropriate referral of possible cases of the COVID-19. In the route have been considered three possible entrances depending on the needs of the users: anti-flu drugs, symptoms related to COVID-19 infection or the request for items for hygiene and prevention of transmission such as alcohol and face masks. Later, self-care education should be given, and the possible cases should be reported to the telephone lines designated by the mayor or the governor, continuing the healthcare process. Community pharmacies and pharmacy staff play a crucial role in minimizing the stage of \"community transmission\" of COVID-19, through properly detection and management of possible cases and customer education.",

We must take into account that in Colombia, the community pharmaciespharmacies located in the neighborhoods and drugstores-are not articulated with the health system, therefore it is necessary to connect them to the process of healthcare that has been implemented to attend the possible cases of COVID-19.
