A philosophy that integrates biological, behavioral, and social determinants of health could benefit multidisciplinary discussions of healthy publics. This manuscript introduces a Philosophy of Health by presenting its first five principles of health. The philosophy creates parallels among biological immunity, health behavior change, social change by proposing that two general functions-precision and variation-impact population health at biological, behavioral, and social levels. This higher-level of abstraction is used to conclude that integrating functions, rather than separated (biological) structures drive healthy publics. A Philosophy of Health provides a framework that can integrate existing theories, models, concepts, and constructs.",

            "text": "Both naturalistic and holistic perspectives guide important observations of health and disease. When one considers health through the BST one pays close attention to the functions of the internal, biological functioning of the human being. When one considers health through the HTH, one pays close attention to the functioning of an individual, in relation to their external, societal/ cultural functions. Is there a hybrid model that accounts for both internal and external functioning? Wakefield's (2014) harmful dysfunction analysis (HDA) creates a hybrid model that integrates natural-and value-laden phenomena when conceptualizing disease. HDA asserts that a person suffers from a disorder/disease if (1) the condition causes harm (as judged by the standards of the person's culture); or if (2) the person's internal, natural processes cannot perform normal functioning (as judged by the standards set by evolution). HDA creates a hybrid model that can integrate perspectives of the BST (i.e. by considering internal organ functioning); and the HTH (i.e. by considering external societal/goal functioning). However, while HDA may define health processes in relation to disease, it serves primarily as an integrative model of disease. Is there an integrative model of health that can account for natural and value-laden functions? Schroeder (2012) identifies a significant, common thread among these competing (or perhaps complementing) philosophies: functionalism. The researcher suggests that each philosophy is concerned with the functioning of organisms. Although the BST, HTH, and the HDA might not agree on which functions inform the first principles of health, Schroder (2012) uses higherlevel abstraction to identify one common first principle: the state of functioning in an organism impacts its state of health. When paralleling the three philosophies based upon functioning one might observe that (1) BST declares an individual healthy if its organs function normally; (2) HTH declares an individual healthy if he/she can function in relation to vital goals; and (3) HDA declares an individual unhealthy if internal mechanisms cannot perform natural, evolutionary functions, and/or when a condition prevents a person from functioning in relation to goals/norms/values. Through this higher-level abstraction, an integration of seemingly separate philosophies of health is made possible.",

Although a definition of \"function\" is not explicitly stated in the above research, it appears that Nordenfeldt (2007) , Boorse (1997) , Wakefield (2014) , and Schroeder (2012) are each discussing functions as pre-existent (i.e. either from evolution, personal goalsetting, cultural tradition) processes-with-purposes. Whether one is describing a value-laden function (e.g. decision-making in pursuit of a valuable career) or an evolutionary-biological function (e.g. the heart beating for circulation), each process (i.e. decision-making processes or cardiac processes) serves identifiable purposes (e.g. maintained financial stability or maintained blood flow). Whether an organ is functioning normally in relation to the body or a human being is functioning in relation to vital goals, it appears that both perspectives consider if an active \"process\" (i.e. an organ's activity, an individual's activity) can express its \"purpose\" (i.e. evolutionary-purpose, life-purpose).",

These behaviors not only have biological, behavioral, and social implications for the individual doing the behavior, but also have intergenerational and interpersonal effects. The individual who binges on refined sugar not only puts themselves at risk of diabetes, but can put their future offspring at risk. The individual who smokes two packs of cigarettes per day not only puts themselves at risk of lung cancer, but can put their housemates at risk of lung cancer from second-hand smoke.

Healthy breathing and moving (as well as eating and drinking) are characteristic of an ease of one's functioning that can be maintained in normal conditions. For example, the chronic smoker and the \"couch potato\" might report momentary-ease in breathing and posture when engaging in their health risk behaviors; but they do not maintain that ease outside of smoking or sitting. Conversely, the yogi might report that their yoga practices expose them to momentary dis-ease in breathing and moving that lead to maintainable-ease in breathing and movement in everyday life. In contrast to disease as a prolongeddysfunction, healthy functioning can be commonly sensed as a maintainable-ease of functioning.",

During periods of rapid increases in social diversity and cultural integration, what supported cooperation in the society? Social systems (e.g. public governments, private social organizations, religious/spiritual organizations) emerge to maintain a functional society. Although it is well documented that a social system can impact biological functioning (CDC, 2016; Riedel, 2005; Cutler and Miller, 2005) and behavioral functioning (Buettner, 2012) , the social system's primary role is to maintain functions at the level of the society.",

When taking a functionalist's perspective, the biological immune system (i.e. the integration of host defense functions and microbiota functions), one's (system of) health behaviors (i.e. the integration of decisionmaking/executive functions and habits/habitual life functions), and the social system (i.e. the integration of population values and population behaviors) appear together in A Philosophy of Health. Fig. 1 The levels of functioning. This philosophy of health investigates three levels of health: cell, self, and society. The level of the cell accounts for biological functioning within human beings. The level of the self accounts for first-person functioning of each human being. The level of the society accounts for group functioning of human beings. Fig. 2 The systems at each level. Each system is responsible for generating maintainable-ease of functioning at a level. The biological immune system is responsible at the level of the cell. A human's system of health behaviors is responsible at the level of the self.

When these population-wide behaviors are chronically restricted in a population (e.g. poor access to health care, oppression of free-speech, economic crash), societies become vulnerable to social/civil unrest [as commented historically by Victor Frankl (1985) , Alexander Solzhenitsyn (2003) , Franklin D.

            "text": "Behavior change interventions can enhance both the precision in one's decisions and the variation in one's habits. During a behavior change intervention, a person's existing habits are exposed to a new variation in habit. For example, the beginning of a new exercise intervention exposes the individual's current habits/habitual functioning to changes in movement and breathing (i.e. exercise) that may also change their patterns of eating and hydration. Through this exposure, a person's decisionmaking might adapt to prioritize maintainable-ease of functioning in the individual's lifestyle. How? Some behavior change interventions train one's decision-making to remove or \"countercondition\" unhealthy habits, by replacing them with healthy habits (Prochaska et al., 1988) . Although modern behavior change interventions have shaped the precision of decisionmaking during health behavior change (e.g. of smoking, diet, alcohol use, inactivity), new problems for health behavior still emerge when the individual is exposed to a new, potentially addictive technology. With this philosophy, behavior change interventionists and health officials might not only ask the question, \"How do we support good decision-making of individuals?\" Researchers, behavior change technology developers, and public health officials may also ask the functional question: \"How do we enhance the precision of one's decisions and the variation of one's habits following the exposure to a new, potentially addictive technology?\" Public health campaigns disseminated by social organizations can enhance the precision of the population's health values and variation in population-wide health behaviors. Leading up to first Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health (1964) , the U.S. Department of Health had become increasingly aware of (i.e. exposed to) variations in a population health behavior. If populations smoked, then populations were more likely to develop lung cancer, laryngeal cancer, or chronic bronchitis (CDC, 2018) . Following this exposure to (the consequences of) population smoking behavior, society's values shifted to prioritize health. How? The Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 was adopted, and the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 was adopted to create new health values. This shift in values prioritized new variations in population health behavior by: (1) requiring a health warning on cigarette packages; (2) banning cigarette advertising in the broadcasting media; and (3) calling for an annual report on the health consequences of smoking (CDC, 2018) . Since these first initiatives adult smoking rates have fallen from about 43% (in 1965) to about 18% today; and mortality rates from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death, are declining (Department of Health and Human Services, 2014). Although the precision of the population's values has been enhanced to impact population behaviors (e.g. the tobacco laws described above supported healthy change), new chronic states can still emerge following exposure to social changes (e.g. the invention of the Juul impacted high school and college aged populations). With this philosophy, public policy officials and public health researchers might not only ask the question, \"How do we create new laws to protect population health from nicotine addiction?\" They may also ask the functional question: \"How do we enhance the precision of the population's values and the variation of the population's behavior following the invention of a new nicotine delivery system technology (e.g. flavored Juuls)?\"",

Exposure, not avoidance, has facilitated population health in these interventions. While healthcare systematically prioritizes biological exposures in the form of vaccine interventions, they do not systematically prioritize behavioral or social exposures. However, it is documented that exposure to healthy behaviors in youth prevents risk behaviors in adolescence (Velicer et al., 2000) ; and exposure to community-based health initiatives can support population health (Dulin et al., 2018; CDC, 2018) . Given that systematic biological exposures in the form of vaccination have led to a global control of some acute infectious diseases (Tangermann et al., 2007) ; might systematic behavioral and social exposures (especially in youth) be needed to enhance global campaigns toward the control of chronic disease?",

Historically, and still too often, health professionals have an expertise at one level, that limits their prescription of interventions to that level. This can actually create barriers to a complete solution when a health problem is multileveled. While a person's mental health is typically assessed based upon their firstperson experience of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; symptoms can be triggered by biological, physiological, behavioral, psychological, and/or social dysfunction. Most clinicians typically do not have the ability to assess and address all forms functioning. So if one person, John, is meeting with a clinician who specializes in primary care medicine, he may only be prescribed a biological intervention like medication. If John is meeting with a clinician who specializes in behavioral medicine, he may only be prescribed a health behavior change intervention. If John is meeting with a clinician who specializes in a certain theory of psychotherapy, he may only be prescribed a psychotherapy intervention based on the clinician's training. If John is meeting with a clinician who specializes in social work, he may only be prescribed a group, community or social intervention. While the above specializations have been helpful in establishing an empirical bases for mental health interventions, overspecialization can be problematic when a multi-leveled solution is needed. In addition, it can also be problematic when a levelspecific solution is needed that the clinician cannot provide (e.g. when psychotherapy is needed but a clinician only has the ability to prescribe psychiatric medication).",

Although his parents' intentions are to protect John, the contrast between his behavior (self's precision-and-variation) and the population social behavior (society-variation) can impact John's health. Notice here how we have not yet considered functions that connect the self to the society (e.g. John's thoughts and feelings).

One person's thoughts and emotions/feelings are processes that help to integrate the functioning of one-self within the functioning of a society. How might John's thoughts and feelings connect his (sense of) self to his society? Perhaps John's parents teach him that it is important to feel separate from his classmates during class so he can think clearly in class; and that he can feel connected to his friends by inviting them over to communicate together after school. This parenting may impact John's thoughts and feelings during school. If John's parents do not talk with him about this topic, John may experience different thoughts and feelings during school hours. When kept to one-self, thoughts and emotions are foundational to an internal sense of self as one functions in the larger society; and, when acted upon, thoughts and feelings can become verbal communication (e.g. speech) and non-verbal communication (e.g. body language, facial expressions) that form an external sense of self that is visible to the society. The (internal) experience of and (external) communication of thoughts, feelings and actions form the foundation of all systems of psychotherapy (Prochaska and Norcross, 2018) .

(2) How fast do other's in your social group typically respond to texts (society-variation)?

For example, aerobic exercise is a health behavior that stimulates changes to variations in breathing and movement. By engaging in this behavior, the biological cells of the body are also stimulated via various physiological processes. Breathing will stimulate cellular functioning via the cardiovascular and respiratory systems; and movement will stimulate cellular functioning via the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and central nervous systems. While all physiological systems are working in collaboration in the body, certain changes to behavioral and biological functioning will stimulate certain physiological systems. By viewing health through this lens, between-level observations join the philosophy: biological functions emerge at the level of the cell; physiological functioning emerges as the cell-self connection; behavioral functions emerge at the level of the self; psychological/ mental functioning emerges as the self-society connection; and social functions emerge at the level of the society.

Research already demonstrates that tailoring interventions for biological precision (Albert-Vega et al., 2018) and biological variation (Brodin et al., 2015) can impact long-term biological functioning. Future innovations might seek to use technology to tailor behavioral and social interventions to generate maintainable-ease of functioning. Through the functional language used in this paper we hope readers are inspired to present new questions, new comments, and new perspectives about needed healthcare innovations. ",
