A previous report demonstrated that loperamide induces autophagy and enhances antimicrobial activity towards M. tuberculosis in murine and human alveolar macrophages. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of loperamide on macrophages with respect to cytokine and antimicrobial peptide production during mycobacterial infection. We infected monocyte-derived macrophages (macrophages) with M. tuberculosis H37Rv at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 and treated the cells with 3 \u03bcM loperamide. Cytokine production in the supernatants of 24-h cultures and gene expression of the cytokines TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2 and IL10 and the antimicrobial peptides LL37 and bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI) in the cell lysates was measured. Intracellular bacterial loads were evaluated by enumerating colony-forming units 3 days posttreatment for M. tuberculosis and 24 h posttreatment for M. smegmatis. We observed that loperamide exerted an immunomodulatory effect on TNF\u03b1 production in human macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis and that these responses were independent of the bacteria, as they also occurred when macrophages were infected with M. smegmatis and to a lesser extent with M. bovis. In addition, antibacterial mechanisms triggered by loperamide induced a significant reduction in bacterial load and an upregulation of BPI and LL37 gene expression. Thus, our results show that loperamide exerts immunomodulatory effects, which supports its use for additional medical conditions other than diarrhea.",

Loperamide is a phenylpiperidine derivative commonly used to treat infectious and noninfectious, acute and chronic diarrhea [2, 3] . Loperamide targets two types of membrane receptors, voltage-dependent and voltage-independent calcium channels and \u03bcand \u03b4-opioid receptors [4] [5] [6] [7] . As loperamide can mediate intracellular calcium levels by blocking calcium channels and activating opioid receptors, several biological effects of loperamide have been described in addition to those involved in diarrhea control, suggesting its potential uses for alleviating pain, controlling anxiety, reducing insulin resistance and inhibiting coronavirus replication [4, [8] [9] [10] . The advantages of performing research dedicated to repurposing currently available drugs include a considerable reduction in the time and costs required to discover new therapeutic approaches [11] .",

            "text": "We recently observed that loperamide enhances control of a M. tuberculosis strain in human and murine alveolar macrophages by inducing autophagy. Furthermore, this antimicrobial activity is associated with a reduction of TNF\u03b1 production, suggesting that loperamide may play a role in preventing excessive inflammation [1] . The regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production is desirable during M. tuberculosis infection, because cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and type I and II interferons, despite their protective roles in immunity against M. tuberculosis, can induce a hyperinflammatory state associated with tissue damage and tuberculosis pathogenesis [12, 13] . Loperamide may induce additional immunoresponses associated with its effect on calcium channels and opioid receptors. The blockade of intracellular calcium influx has been shown to cause a reduction in the production of the LPS-dependent proinflammatory cytokines IL6, TNF\u03b1, MCP-1 and IFN\u03b3 in murine macrophages [14] . Activation of \u03bc-opioid receptors induces the production of the proinflammatory chemokines TNF\u03b1 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in endothelial cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [15, 16] . Thus, loperamide may have an immunomodulatory activity that could be useful as an adjunctive therapy against M. tuberculosis infection and should be evaluated to elucidate its utility in new clinical indications.",

We measured the proinflammatory mediator profile and the induction of two antimicrobial peptides, bactericidal/ permeability increasing protein (BPI) and cathelicidin LL37. Both BPI and LL37 may be involved in inducing M. tuberculosis death, and both are known to downregulate proinflammatory mediator production in addition to their antimicrobial peptide functions. We observed that loperamide exerted an immunomodulatory effect on TNF\u03b1 and antimicrobial peptide production by human macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis and that these responses were independent of the bacteria, as they also occurred when macrophages were infected with M. smegmatis and to a lesser extent with M. bovis. In addition, the antibacterial mechanisms triggered by loperamide included upregulation of BPI and LL37 gene expression via \u03bc-opioid receptor-dependent immunomodulatory responses. Although there are limitations to the extent to which human diseases are fully represented by in vitro models, such models have the potential to contribute to the early identification and prioritization of active molecules that induce signals relevant to disease biology in studies that aim to repurpose existing drugs.",

We showed that the reduced bacterial load observed in infected macrophages treated with loperamide was accompanied by an increase in IL1\u03b2 production at both the protein and transcriptional levels. We observed a significant increase in IL10 and a significant reduction in TNF\u03b1 production at both the protein and transcriptional levels. In addition, we observed increases in PGE2 production and COX-2 gene expression, the enzyme responsible for PGE2 synthesis, in infected macrophages treated with loperamide. The addition of LPS to infected macrophages induced a significant increase in cytokine production compared to that in nontreated cells (Fig. 2) . The production of significant amounts of IL6 and GM-CSF were induced in infected macrophages compared to nontreated cells (medium) (Supplementary Fig. 2) . Changes in the production of IL12p70 were not significant in any of the treatments assessed. In addition, the production of IL8 was not modified under loperamide or LPS treatments ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . Control experiments demonstrated that loperamide alone did not affect the macrophage numbers nor their viability (100% of macrophages remained in the wells and they were 96.3 \u00b1 3.1% viable) over the course of the culture time. Bacterial infection reduced the number of cells and their viability (75 \u00b1 10% of remaining cells were 80 \u00b1 13% viable). The addition of loperamide slightly prevented cell loss (81.6 \u00b1 13% of remaining cells were 98 \u00b1 1.3% viable) (Supplementary Fig. 1a and d).",

In macrophages, the best studied inducer of LL37 is vitamin D, and the induction of LL37 by vitamin D is dependent on the synthesis of the active form of 1,25(OH)(2)D and the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) [22] . BPI is induced in human macrophages by several PAMPs, such as LPS and flagellin, during bacterial infection [24] . The mechanism involved in BPI and LL37 induction by loperamide may include distinct signal transduction pathways that converge on a common transduction signal of both antimicrobial peptides. Thus, we demonstrated that in addition to the antimicrobial activity associated with autophagy induction [1] , loperamide treatment induces antimicrobial activity in macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis in association with antimicrobial peptide production.",

The role of loperamide in regulating inflammation during infection has not been previously reported, and we observed that it was not restricted to M. tuberculosis infections, as this activity as also observed in cells infected by the mycobacteria M. smegmatis and M. bovis. Because IL10 exerts a suppressive effect on TNF\u03b1 production [25] , the induction of IL10 by loperamide may explain the reduction in TNF\u03b1 production. IL-1\u03b2 has been reported to partially act through COX2 to induce PGE2 synthesis, which regulates the containment of M. tuberculosis [26] . Therefore, the induction of IL1\u03b2 production by loperamide may participate in mycobacterial killing through the incremental increase in COX-2 and PGE2 levels. In addition, the antimicrobial peptides BPI and LL37 can both modulate host immune responses and participate in the regulation of cytokine expression by targeting inflammatory pathways such as Toll-like receptor and NF-kB [27] [28] [29] , suggesting that the induction of BPI and LL37 production by loperamide also plays a role in the immunoregulation of TNF\u03b1, IL10 and PGE2 production. Under induced stress conditions, murine macrophages have been observed to display an intermediary macrophage phenotype between M1, characterized by high antibacterial activity (with LL37 and extracellular trap induction) and M2, characterized by increased IL-10 production and reduced TNF\u03b1 production [30] . We observed that loperamide induced the production of high levels of IL1\u03b2, IL6, GM-CSF, BPI and LL37, which is associated with an M1 phenotype, and high levels of IL10 and PGE2, which is associated with an M2 phenotype. This loperamide-induced cytokine and antimicrobial peptide profile resembles an intermediary macrophage phenotype [30] .",

            "text": "We further investigated the signaling pathways responsible for loperamide modulation of TNF\u03b1 production using the M. smegmatis infection model, as it induced higher amounts of TNF\u03b1 than M. tuberculosis and allowed for better discrimination of the roles of various pathways, with the additional advantage of it being a fast-growth mycobacterium. Pretreatment of macrophages with a calcium ionophore (Bay K8644) did not restore the inhibition of M. smegmatis-induced TNF\u03b1 production by loperamide, suggesting that the blockade of calcium channels by loperamide was unlikely to be responsible for the observed modulation of TNF\u03b1 production. This phenomenon was unexpected, because M. smegmatis induced-production of TNF\u03b1 largely depends on Ca 2+ signaling [31] . However, the role of calcium in mediating TNF\u03b1 production is controversial, because increased intracellular Ca 2+ due to calcium influx (channel-mediated) exerts an inhibitory effect on LPS-induced TNF\u03b1 production [32] . In contrast, the inhibition of calcium influx also causes reduced TNF\u03b1 production and decreased protection against excess inflammation [33, 34] . A negligible participation of the calcium blockade on the TNF\u03b1 production and antimicrobial responses induced by loperamide was observed in mycobacterium-infected macrophages, as the restoration of intracellular calcium levels by Bay K8644 did not prevent M. smegmatis killing. This phenomenon was unexpected, because calcium channel blockade triggers antimicrobial autophagy [35, 36] . M. tuberculosis has been reported to interfere with macrophage microbicidal mechanisms and to inhibit murine and human macrophage Ca 2+ signaling to evade immune detection or decrease phagolysosome formation and macrophage reactive oxygen species production, contributing to the intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis [37] . Thus, loperamide is likely important in inducing other bactericidal mechanisms that are unrelated to the blockade of Ca 2+ influx.",

We evaluated the effect of naltrexone, an opioid antagonist that effectively neutralizes loperamide gastric pathways [38] , observing that naltrexone restored M. smegmatis-induced TNF\u03b1 production in loperamide-treated macrophages. This finding suggests that the activation of opioid receptors by loperamide was, at least partially, involved in the regulation of TNF\u03b1 production. In addition, we observed that activation of opioid receptors by loperamide also mediated the antimicrobial activity of macrophages, as naltrexone partially abrogated the loperamide-dependent bacterial clearance and completely abrogated the upregulated BPI and LL37 gene expression, which was not observed upon treatment with the calcium ionophore.

These results support the potential use of loperamide for treating infectious diseases such as mycobacterial infections. In addition, our findings suggest that agonistdependent \u03bc-opioid receptor signaling in human macrophages has potential roles in the immunomodulation of infectious diseases.
