However, its ability to induce the type I interferon (IFN) response has not yet been characterized. Here, we demonstrate that g-PGA induces type I IFN signaling pathway via the TLR4 signaling pathway. The induction required both myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2) and the pattern-recognition receptor CD14, which are two TLR4associated accessory proteins. The g-PGA with high molecular weights (2000 and 5000 kDa) was able to activate the subsequent signals through TLR4/MD2 to result in dimerization of IRF-3, a transcription factor required for IFN gene expression, leading to increases in mRNA levels of the type I IFN-response genes, 2 0 e5 0 OAS and ISG56. Moreover, g-PGA (2000 kDa) displayed an antiviral activity against SARS coronavirus and hepatitis C virus. Our results identify high-molecular weight g-PGA as a TLR4 ligand and demonstrate that g-PGA requires both CD14 and MD2 for the activation of type I IFN responses. Our results suggest that the microbial biopolymer g-PGA may have therapeutic potential against a broad range of viruses sensitive to type I IFNs.",

LPS is recognized by the TLR4myeloid-differentiation-factor-2 (-MD2) complex through hydrophobic interactions [1] ; its recognition activates two downstream pathways: the myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathway and the TIR domain-containing adaptor protein-inducing IFN-b (TRIF)-dependent pathway [2e5] . Recent evidence suggests that TLR4 signaling can also be activated by several non-LPS TLR4 ligands; a cell-wall skeletal component derived from Mycobacterium sp. and OK-432 derived from Streptococcus sp. [6] induce TLR4-mediated innate and acquired immune responses through NK and T-cell activation. In addition, increasing numbers of proteins that are TLR4 ligands have been identified [7] .",

Anionic g-PGA molecules with various molecular weights are produced and secreted by Bacillus species such as Bacillus subtilus (natto), a strain producing the traditional Japanese fermented food \"natto\", and B. subtilus sp. Chungkookjang, a strain used for the production of a transitional Korean fermented seasoning made from soybeans [13] . This biodegradable, non-toxic microbial polymer has been used as a delivery agent for therapeutic proteins, protein vaccines, and anti-tumor drugs [14, 15] . g-PGA was also shown to activate immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes, and induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-g, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, and interleukin-1 [16, 17] . It was proposed that this in vivo activation of immune cells by g-PGA is mediated by the (500 ng each/well) and with the luciferase expressing plasmids for the IFN-b promoter activity assay as in Fig. 1A . The transfected cells were treated with 100 mM g-PGAs with different molecular weights. As positive controls for the assay, the indicated concentrations of LPS and 0.2 mg/ml poly(I:C) were used to stimulate IFN-b promoter activity.

Furthermore, a recent report demonstrated the prophylactic effectiveness of intra-nasally administered g-PGA against the influenza virus in mice [18] . The details, however, of how g-PGA activates TLR4 and possibly induces the type I interferon (a and b) response have not yet been investigated. This study was performed to uncover the molecular mechanism underlying g-PGA-mediated activation of TLR4 signaling pathway and its impact on RNA virus replication. We investigated whether MD2 and the plasma membrane-localized pattern recognition receptor (PRR) CD14 are required as accessory molecules for g-PGA to induce the TLR4-mediated IFN responses. We also assessed the antiviral activity of g-PGA against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Our data validate the potential of g-PGA as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent that triggers type I IFN signaling.",

            "text": "PGA requires the CD14 for signal transduction through the TLR4-MD2 complex TLR4 is known to require multiple cofactors, including LPSbinding protein, MD2, and CD14, to respond to LPS [12] . CD14 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein found on the surface of many TLR4-expressing cells [28] . CD14 interacts with various ligands including a variety of microbial products such as LPS [29e32] and peptidoglycan [33] ; synthetic molecules such as the negatively charged, high-molecular weight nucleic acid poly(I:C) [34] ; and CpG DNA [12, 35] . We hypothesized that the TLR4 cofactors MD2 and/or CD14 may be required for g-PGA to activate TLR4 and subsequent type I IFN responses. To test this hypothesis, we first assessed the ability of g-PGA to activate the IFN-b promoter using a luciferase reporter plasmid carrying the binding site of IRF-3, a transcription factor activated by Tankbinding kinase 1 (TBK1) upon TLR4 stimulation [4, 5, 36] . We used the HEK293hTLR4 cell line stably expressing human TLR4, because the parental cell line HEK293 does not express TLR4 [37] . Moreover, other accessory molecules required for TLR4-mediated LPS sensing are deficient in HEK293 cells, making them unresponsive to LPS [37] . HEK293hTLR4 cells were thus transfected with sets of plasmids expressing either MD2, or CD14, or both, along with the reporter plasmids for the INF-b promoter assay. After treating the transfected cells with 100 mM of 2000-kDa g-PGA for 30 h, we performed a dual luciferase-activity assay. As shown in Fig. 1 , g-PGA led to activation of IFN-b promoter in a CD14-dependent manner. Expression of CD14 alone increased the promoter activity by 35%, whereas expression of MD2 alone failed to trigger the promoter activation. This result suggests that CD14 may act as a PRR for g-PGA. Co-expression of MD2 with CD14 further increased the IFN-b promoter activity by up to 84%, which is comparable to the response induced by 200 ng/ml LPS. This result underscores the critical role of MD2 in the TLR4-mediated signaling pathway.",

As shown in Fig. 1B , when MD2 and CD14 were coexpressed, IRF-3 dimerization was induced by g-PGA, further confirming essential roles of these proteins in the activation of TLR4 signaling by g-PGA. The degree of IRF-3 dimerization was comparable to that induced by HCV 3 0 -UTR transcripts containing 5 0 terminal triphosphate and poly-U/UC region, which is known to activate IRF-3 by being recognized by cytosolic retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) [25] . The activation of IRF-3 by g-PGA was delayed compared to 3 0 -UTR-mediated intracellular activation of type I interferon signaling pathway, probably because transfected genes had to be expressed prior to the TLR4 signaling activation (Fig. 1C) . Collectively, these results show that g-PGA is capable of eliciting the IFN-b response via TLR4 in a MD2-and CD14-dependent manner. ",

Taking advantage of the fact that among IFN-a, -b, and -g, IFN-b is the most potent protector against SARS-CoV [40] , we assessed the antiviral activity of g-PGA against SARS-CoV using the pSARS-REP-Feo replicon plasmid (Fig. 4C, top panel) . This replicon, which lacks the viral structural genes (except for the N capsidprotein gene), produces the viral RNA transcript from a cytomegalovirus promoter and a subgenomic RNA harboring Feo (a firefly luciferase gene fused to a neomycin phosphotransferase gene) from TRS9 to display luciferase activity. This replicon was previously shown to replicate in HEK293 cells [21] . As shown in Fig. 4B , 2000-kDa g-PGA induced IFN-b expression in a dosedependent manner over the 1e500 mM range in which g-PGA showed no significant cytotoxicity on HEK293hTLR4 cells, as assessed by MTS assay (Fig. 4A) . We evaluated the antiviral activity of g-PGA in the HEK293hTLR4 cells transiently transfected with pSARS-REP-Feo and plasmids expressing MD2 and CD14. As shown in Fig. 4C , stimulation of the transfected cells with 100 mM of 2000-kDa g-PGA resulted in 65% reduction in luciferase activity, while IFN-b 1a, a potent IFN for suppressing SARS-CoV replication [40] , reduced the reporter activity by 52%.

To test the antiviral activity of g-PGA against HCV, we first investigated whether the hepatocarcinoma cell line Huh7, which is the only available cell line efficiently supporting HCV replication and propagation [42] , requires TLR4, and MD2 and/or CD14 for induction of IFN-b expression by g-PGA. As shown in Fig. 5A , g-PGA stimulation increased the IFN-b mRNA levels only when MD2 and CD14 were coexpressed, as demonstrated in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1 ). In consistent with previous studies demonstrating the expression of TLR4 in hepatocytes [43, 44] , TLR4 overexpression did not further stimulate the IFN-b expression. This increased IFN-b gene expression level was associated with IRF-3 dimerization (Fig. 5B) , further confirming the capacity of g-PGA to activate the IFN-b signaling pathway. Those MD2 and CD14-epressed Huh7 cells were treated with 2000-kDa g-PGA and subsequently transfected with HCV genome encoding GFP reporter. Analysis of HCV replication levels, as assessed by GFP signal, showed that the treatment with 2000-kDa g-PGA resulted in significant inhibition of HCV replication, whereas little inhibition was seen with 5000-kDa g-PGA. More importantly, in HCV-infected cells, significant reduction in intracellular HCV genome titer (82% inhibition, p < 0.01) was observed in cells treated with 2000-kDa g-PGA, while the 5000-kDa g-PGA displayed marginal anti-HCV activity (Fig. 5E ). The antiviral activity of 100 mM 2000-kDa g-PGA was comparable to that achieved with 1 mg/ml LPS or 500 U/ml IFN-a, verifying the antiviral activity of g-PGA in virus-infected cells.",

            "text": "TLR4 activates two distinct signaling pathways that are regulated by the MyD88 and TRIF adaptor proteins to elicit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs, respectively [2e5]. The results presented here demonstrate that g-PGA is an agonist that activates the type I IFN signaling pathway via the TLR4-MD2 complex. The type I IFN responses were only stimulated by g-PGAs with molecular weights of 2000-and 5000-kDa, with the former one being more effective in stimulation of IFN-b production in both hPBMCs and murine macrophage. The IFN responses required CD14 as a PRR and led to inhibition of SARS-CoV replication, as assessed with a SARS-CoV replicon. In addition, substantial reduction in HCV genome titer was seen in HCV-infected Huh7 cells after treatment with 2000-kDa g-PGA. In the present work, we used transformed cells such as HEK293 and Huh7 to investigate whether TLR4 and its cofactors are required for IFN-b gene induction by g-PGA, via transient expression of those proteins, because observations would be blurred if dendritic cells or macrophages expressing multiple TLRs were used. Highlighting a functional role of g-PGA as a TLR4 ligand, IFN-b secretion was also observed in hPBMCs and murine macrophage. It is worthy of note that TLR4 expression increases under hepatic inflammation conditions [44] and that HCV infection induces TLR4 expression, leading to enhanced production of IFN-b in human B cells, particularly after LPS stimulation [43] . Furthermore, CD14 expression in hepatocytes is enhanced in inflammatory states [45] and during endotoxemia [46] . Thus, it is likely that IFN-b expression would be highly up-regulated by g-PGA in virus-infected liver. The chief targets of SARS-CoV infection in the human lung are alveolar epithelium and macrophages, and the latter is predominant infiltrating immune cells in response to the virus infection [47] . Therefore, via paracrine interactions between Kupffer cells and hepatocytes in the liver or pulmonary alveolar epithelium and macrophages in the lungs, g-PGA would potentially lead to synergistic antiviral activity in vivo. Recently, Moon et al. [18] demonstrated in vivo antiviral activity of nasally-delivered g-PGA against influenza A virus, which was proposed to be attributable to the type II IFN (IFN-g) produced mainly by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Our results, together with those of previous studies, suggest that g-PGA can activate host innate immune responses to display antiviral activity by induction of both type I (a and b) and type II (g) IFNs.",

The crystal structure of TLR4-MD2 in complex with E. coli LPS shows that the hydrophobic lipid chains of LPS, a large amphipathic molecule with a molecular weight up to several ten thousand [48] , are buried in the hydrophobic pocket of MD2 [1] . In addition, MD2 has been shown to play a role in the dimerization of TLR4; two MD2-LPS complexes are involved in bridging two TLR4 molecules because the two TLR4 molecules in the TLR4-MD2 heterodimer have limited direct interaction, as revealed by the crystal structure of TLR4 in complex with its ligand and MD2 [1] . We found that HEK293/hTLR4 cells transiently expressing MD2 failed to respond to g-PGA in the absence of CD14. Thus, it is unlikely that MD2 directly interacts with g-PGA, particularly when considering the hydrophilic nature of g-PGA. MD2 coexpressed with CD14, however, allowed the activation of the IFN-b promoter and consequently resulted in IRF-3 activation, suggesting a functional role of MD2 in g-PGA-mediated TLR4-pathway activation. One possible explanation for the requirement of MD2 would be its role in TLR4 expression on the cell surface [49, 50] .",

The crystal structure of CD14 shows that the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket is the principle LPS-binding site [51] . Previous biochemical investigation and structural analysis of CD14, however, strongly suggest that the long, hydrophilic, negatively charged carbohydrate chain of LPS has some affinity for CD14 [51, 52] . Consistent with those studies, CD14 does indeed interact with other negatively charged TLR ligands such as CpG DNA [12, 35] and poly(I:C) [34] . Thus, the interaction of g-PGA with CD14 is reminiscent of other hydrophilic molecules interacting with CD14 by as-yet-unknown mechanisms. Our data and the previous results discussed above suggest the role of CD14 as a PRR of multiple damage-associated molecular patterns, including PAMPs and the alarmins released in response to stress and tissue damage [12] . Nevertheless, it remains to be elucidated how CD14 can recognize different molecular compositions, particularly those of negatively charged molecules.",

Furthermore, IFN-b induction by 5000-kDa g-PGA was attenuated compared with induction by 2000-kDa g-PGA. It is not clear why g-PGA activates TLR4-MD2 signaling transduction in such a molecular weightdependent manner. g-PGA may form diverse conformations (ahelix, b-sheet, random coil, enveloped aggregation) at different pHs; it was proposed that at pH 6.0 a lower molecular weight (30 kDa) g-PGA forms a linear random coil with polyanionic characteristics [14] . Although we still do not know what conformations or structures can be formed by HMW g-PGAs, hydrophobically modified g-PGA (molecular weight: 300 kDa), prepared by the covalent attachment of L-phenylalanine ethyl ester, was shown to form nanoparticles due to its amphiphilic properties [53] . A g-PGA nanoparticle with a mean diameter of 210 nm was recently shown to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production via the TLR4 and MyD88 signaling pathways in mouse macrophages [54] . Those results, along with ours, are in some respects similar to the data presented in other recent studies demonstrating that LPS aggregates, but not monomers, are biologically active in the activation of TLR4-mediated inflammatory-cytokine production in human mononuclear cells [55, 56] . It remains to be determined how the g-PGAs, hydrophilic amino-acid-glutamate polymers with different molecular weights and/or structures, act as ligands of CD14 in the activation of the TLR4 and TRIF-dependent signaling pathway. This is a certainly challenging question that remains to be answered.",

            "text": "A recent report may give at least some clue as to the possible mechanisms explaining the attenuated IFN-b induction by the 5000-kDa g-PGA. Zanoni et al. [28] showed that CD14 is required for LPS-induced TLR4 endocytosis in dendritic cells, which leads to the induction of TRIF signaling to promote IFN expression in a TLR4containing endosomal vesicle. It is tempting to speculate that the g-PGA-TLR4 complexes are subjected to CD14-mediated endocytosis, and that g-PGAs with a molecular weight greater than 2000 kDa interferes with this endocytosis. We favor the hypothesis that, as shown with LPS [28] , the g-PGA-CD14/TLR4-MD2 complex is transported into endosomal vesicles to stimulate TRIF-mediated IFN expression. This hypothesis is consistent with previous findings that CD14 is marginally important for MyD88-dependent TNF-a induction by LPS, but essential for TRIF-mediated IFN expression in macrophages [57] . Although further studies are needed to clarify the precise entry mechanisms of the HMW g-PGAs, CD14-dependent endocytosis of TLR4-g-PGA complexes into endosomes and subsequent induction of TRIF-dependent signaling may contribute to the type I IFN responses providing antiviral protection.",
