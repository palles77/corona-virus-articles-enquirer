Since the prevalence of the pathogens and infections are determined by many site-by-site factors, which are not compliant with conventional approaches for approximate reasoning, we introduce fuzzy information.

Diagnostic reasoning is the process of reconstructing the past facts from the observed In some clinical cases, various factors may raise the difficulty in reasoning, such as the demographic variances of nosography, the incomplete knowledge of the diseases (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the early 2003), some specific restrictions on estimating relevant parameters of the diseases, etc. In these cases, the clinicians' experiences and judgments may be useful to diagnosis and prescription. Therefore, the site-by-site factors and clinicians' knowledge, which may be expressed as extra constraints in the reasoning systems, need to be integrated into the medical decision support systems. At the same time, owing to the difficulties to estimate the causal effects between possible pathogens and the diseases, the parameters of the knowledge base can be expressed as fuzzy numbers.",

Second, as a common fact, the experts may have some professional speculations in the form of constraints when reasoning from a Bayesian network or an influence diagram. These constraints could be boundary, dependency, or disjunctive conditions. Third, the investigators of influence diagrams used to maximize the utility functions by node removal processes [11] [12] [13] and ignore diagnostic reasoning tasks.

Part of the LINGO model is listed in Appendix A.

We also find thatx 4 ,x 7 ,x 8 are referenced significantly apart from the most possible values. It makes sense that, under this reasoning context, the experts need to make some subjective judgment or trade-off between different, even conflicting information sources, which make the fuzzy parameters referenced apart from their most confident values.

First, as the clinical problems grow larger and more complex, it may be a burden for the clinicians to formulate the model. In some diseases, there may be tens or hundreds of nodes in the networks. The clinicians will have difficulties to estimate the parameters or specify the conditions of their diagnosis and prescription. Therefore, the system needs some experts in knowledge engineering or information management to participate in, which consequently increases the costs to implement. Second, as the scales of network grow larger, belief propagation will be more complicated and time-consuming. Some special techniques for belief propagation may be considered, such as clustering, joint tree decomposition, stochastic simulation, and so on [2, 3, [7] [8] [9] [10] . How to integrate these propagation methods and the optimization model will be a critical issue in implementing the reasoning system. Third, as network structures become huge, implementing the optimization model with LINGO will be fairly challenging. LINGO provides several interfaces with other applications, such as Visual C++, Visual Java, Visual Basic, etc. The system developers can bundle LINGO's functionality into their applications, or call functions from within the LINGO models that were written in an external programming language [21] . It will facilitate generating the codes for LINGO models and importing the input data from other applications.",
