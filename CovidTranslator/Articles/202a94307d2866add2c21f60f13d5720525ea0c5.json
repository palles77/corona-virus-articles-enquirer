Historically, CoV infection in humans has been associated with mild upper respiratory tract diseases (1) . However, the identification of the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2003 (3) and the recently emerged (April 2012) Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (4) , which has been associated with acute pneumonia, redefined historic perceptions and potentiated the relevance of CoVs as important human pathogens. In this sense, the development of CoV infectious clones provides a valuable molecular tool to study fundamental viral processes, to develop genetically defined vaccines, and to test antiviral drugs. However, the generation of CoV infectious clones has been hampered for long time due to the huge size of the CoV genome (around 30 kb) and the toxicity of some CoV replicase gene sequences during its propagation in bacteria. Recently, these problems were overcome using non-traditional approaches based on the use of bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) (5) , in vitro ligation of cDNA fragments (6) , and vaccinia virus as a vector for the propagation of CoV fulllength cDNAs (7, 8) .",

In this system, the full-length cDNA copy of the viral genome is assembled in the BAC plasmid pBeloBAC11 (10) (Fig. 1) , a lowcopy-number plasmids based on the Escherichia coli F-factor (11) that presents a strictly controlled replication leading to one or two plasmid copies per cell. This plasmid minimize the instability problem of several CoV sequences when amplified in high-copy-number plasmids, allows the stable maintenance of large DNA fragments in bacteria (11) , and its manipulation is similar to that of conventional plasmids. The cDNA of the CoV genome is assembled in the BAC under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter and it is flanked at the 3\u2032-end by a 25-bp synthetic poly(A) followed by the sequences of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme and the bovine growth hormone (BGH) termination and polyadenylation signals to produce synthetic RNAs bearing authentic 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-ends of the viral genome. This DNA-launched system couples expression of the viral RNA in the nucleus from the CMV promoter (12) with a second amplification step in the cytoplasm driven by the viral polymerase, allowing the recovery of infectious virus from the cDNA clone without the need of in vitro ligation and transcription steps. Although some splicing events could occur during the nuclear expression of the viral genome, the efficiency of this phenomenon is very low and does not affect the recovery of infectious virus (5) .",

If only small numbers of transformant colonies are expected, it is recommended to spread 200 \u03bcL-aliquots of the electroporated cells on different plates. 21 A mix of small and large colonies indicates that the cloned DNA fragment presents some toxicity when amplified in E. coli. Choose the small colonies, which may contain the correct insert, and always grow the bacteria containing this recombinant BAC plasmid at 30\u00b0C to minimize the toxicity problem. In this case, we strongly recommend inserting this toxic DNA fragment into the infectious clone in the last cloning step, in order to reduce the manipulation and minimize the possibility of introducing unwanted mutations. Infectious BAC cDNA clones presenting a residual toxicity should be grown at 30\u00b0C. 22 It is important to avoid overloading the reaction by adding too much bacteria, which may alter the ionic balance of the reaction and inhibit the amplification by the Taq polymerase.

For each transfection sample, prepare transfection mixtures in sterile microfuge tubes as follows: 23 We recommend use this storage method for BAC clones that present a residual toxicity and are not fully stables when amplified in E. coli. 24 The Red recombination system combined with counterselection with I-SceI endonuclease results in an accurate and highly efficient method to introduce insertions, deletions or point mutations in BAC clones without retention of unwanted foreign sequences. 25 The transfection of BACs containing large inserts into mammalian cells has been optimized in our laboratory and the best transfection efficiencies were provided using Lipofectamine 2000 as transfection reagent. 26 All work involving MERS-CoV has to be performed in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) laboratory, following the guidelines of the European Commission and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of USA. 27 Do not add antibiotics to media during transfection as this may decrease transfection activity. A healthy cell culture is critical for an efficient transfection. The use of low passage-number cells is recommended. 28 Use a BAC DNA isolated with the Qiagen Large-Construct Kit since a DNA preparation of high purity is required in the transfection step.
