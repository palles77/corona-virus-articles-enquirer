            "text": "Background: The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infected over 8000 people and killed 774. Transmission of SARS occurred through direct and indirect contact and large droplet nuclei. The World Health Organization recommended the use of household disinfectants, which have not been previously tested against SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), to disinfect potentially contaminated environmental surfaces. There is a need for a surrogate test system given the limited availability of the SARS-CoV for testing and biosafety requirements necessary to safely handle it. In this study, the antiviral activity of standard household products was assayed against murine hepatitis virus (MHV), as a potential surrogate for SARS-CoV. Methods: A surface test method, which involves drying an amount of virus on a surface and then applying the product for a specific contact time, was used to determine the virucidal activity. The virus titers and log reductions were determined by the Reed and Muench tissue culture infective dose (TCID) 50 end point method. Results: When tested as directed, common household disinfectants or antiseptics, containing either 0.050% of triclosan, 0.12% of PCMX, 0.21% of sodium hypochlorite, 0.23% of pine oil, or 0.10% of a quaternary compound with 79% of ethanol, demonstrated a 3-log reduction or better against MHV without any virus recovered in a 30-second contact time. Conclusion: Common household disinfectants and antiseptics were effective at inactivating MHV, a possible surrogate for SARS-CoV, from surfaces when used as directed. In an outbreak caused by novel agents, it is important to know the effectiveness of disinfectants and antiseptics to prevent or reduce the possibility of human-to-human transmission via surfaces.",

            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak infected 8098 people and killed 774 in 2003. 1 Because SARS was a new emerging disease, a medical treatment or vaccine was not available to prevent further cases or to help the infected survive. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was discovered in March of 2003 and shortly after was classified as a member of the family of viruses known as Coronaviridae. 2 However, recent phylogenetic analyses have suggested that SARS-CoV is equally related to any of the groups and belongs in a new group, group IV. 3, 4 SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) share many structural and genetic similarities. Both viruses have a similar genome organization and both contain 2 overlapping open reading frames (ORF) known as ORF 1a and ORF 1b, which are important to initiate translation. 5,6 SARS-CoV and MHV are enveloped viruses, and this structural similarity is very important when determining resistance and sensitivity to chemical disinfectants and antiseptics. One difference is that, whereas SARS-CoV is a biosafety level (BSL)-3 agent, MHV can be studied in a BSL-2 facility. Because SARS-CoV and MHV share many structural and genetic similarities and because MHV can be studied in a BSL-2 facility, the analysis of MHV may serve to answer questions about SARS-CoV more quickly and without the need to set up complex research facilities. MHV has the potential to be a suitable surrogate for SARS-CoV.",

It has been documented that the SARS-CoV can survive up to 96 hours on surfaces, whereas other studies have shown the virus to retain its infectivity up to 6 days. 7 The effectiveness of disinfectants and antiseptics against the SARS-CoV was unknown. However, the lipophilic structure of SARS-CoV gave an indication that this virus, if similar to other lipophilic viruses, could easily be deactivated on surfaces from disinfectants.
