The changes in physiology and behaviour which characterise the acute sickness response are also well documented in a wide range of vertebrate species indicating strong evolutionary conservation of the phenomenon (Hart, 1988; Konsman et al., 2002) . This response is initiated in the periphery by elements of the activated immune system, and is mediated by the action of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other acute phase proteins. The acute sickness response is ultimately translated into central nervous system events via activation of resident microglial cells, secondary production of mediators, and ultimately altered neural transmissions (Vollmer-Conna, 2001) .",

This is illustrated by case series of patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) manifestations such as myalgia, range from 7% to 50% (Fan et al., 2006; Muller et al., 2006) , and approximately 30% of patients report chills and rigors, whereas the remainder do not (Booth et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2004; Fan et al., 2006; Muller et al., 2006) . As analysis of variability in the genome of the SARS Corona virus (SARS CoV), has revealed very limited alterations between isolates (Ruan et al., 2003; Salemi et al., 2004) , it is unlikely that these variations in individual symptoms relate to changes in the pathogen.",

Given the observed variations within the detailed pattern of the acute sickness response to a given pathogen, we therefore sought to test the hypothesis that the pathophysiological basis of relatively discrete 'symptom domains' within the overall illness complex may also be differentially influenced by genetic polymorphisms. This notion of symptom domains is analogous to the concept of 'endophenotypes', which arose relatively recently out of the substantive challenges of pathophysiological research into the common, complex, and heritable disorders of mental health, including major depression and bipolar disorder (Cannon and Keller, 2006) . The intent of this concept was to divide behavioural symptoms into recognisable and stable characteristics with a likely (or proven) genetic association. The assumptions underlying the concept are firstly that genes influencing susceptibility to mental disorders are likely to be mediated via multiple neurotransmitter systems affecting multiple neurobehavioural processes such as attention, memory, stress sensitivity, and emotional regulation (Cannon et al., 2001) ; and secondly, that identification of genetic or other biological correlates with an endophenotype is likely to be less complex than that of the illness phenotype overall (Gottesman and Gould, 2003) . Although this field is still in its infancy, one of the best examples is in the context of studies of suicidal behaviour, in which impulsive-aggressive behaviour is an endophenotype, and with which polymorphisms in the serotonin receptor-1B gene (5-HT 1B ) have been associated (Zouk et al., 2007) .",

Items relevant to each endophenotype were further selected by face validity and included in the initial PCA for each domain. For symptom items which were duplicated (e.g., SPHERE Q1 -'headache' and PSC Q7 -'had a headache'), the item with the lower loading score on the first component in the PCA was removed. The initial PCAs were then refined by sequential removal of non-salient (loading score <0.4) symptom items and ensuring that the first component accounted for >30% of the variance.

            "text": "Although the illness complex as a whole and its severity were independent of demographics, females were over-represented in the high severity groups for fatigue, neurocognitive difficulties, and mood disturbance. This finding is consistent with previous studies showing that women are more likely to report both physical and psychological symptoms than men (Gijsbers van Wijk et al., 1991; Barsky et al., 2001) , with one study demonstrating that most physical symptoms are typically reported at least twice as commonly by women in a healthy, disease-free setting (Kroenke and Spitzer, 1998) . It has been proposed that as a result of their reproductive role, women are more attentive to bodily changes (Gijsbers van Wijk et al., 1991; Barsky et al., 2001) , and/or have heightened interoceptive awareness which allows them to sense internal disruptions more easily; and may thus be more likely to report symptoms (Gijsbers van Wijk et al., 1991; Barsky et al., 2001) . Gender socialisation roles may additionally impact on this phenomenon (Gijsbers van Wijk et al., 1991; Barsky et al., 2001) . Interestingly, although no sex difference in seroprevalence or clinical illness rates are reported for EBV, men are more commonly symptomatic with acute QF than women (at a ratio of 2.5:1), despite equal seroprevalence (Tissot Dupont et al., 1992) . Studies in a mouse model of QF suggest this may be attributable to the effects of oestrogens on the host response (Leone et al., 2004) .",

In particular, the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a have been most studied and each shown to induce fever, fatigue, anhedonia, anorexia, depressed mood and to perturb cognitive functions. On the other hand, the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 has been shown to inhibit the symptoms of the acute sickness response (Krzyszton et al., 2008) . In our previous study in DIOS demonstrated strong correlations between symptom severity during the acute illness and ex vivo production of IL-1b and IL-6 (Vollmer-Conna et al., 2004). In particular, symptoms of mood disturbance were associated with IL-6 production, whereas fatigue and other physical symptoms were better correlated with IL-1 production, raising the suggestion that individual cytokines may influence the generation of different components of the symptom complex.",
