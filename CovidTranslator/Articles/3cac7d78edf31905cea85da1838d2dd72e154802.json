This stress creates a demand on an individual to make a decision on the balance between work and family. People have difficulty working in different roles or even multiple roles (as a supervisor in work, a parent at home, a child helping elderly parents in a Chinese cultural context) which leads to stress (Grandey and Cropanzano, 1999) . In 1991, Nelson-Horchler conducted a survey and discovered that only 36% of the respondents rated a job as the most important priority in their lives. This finding was echoed by the generation X'ers emphasis on quality of life (Report, 1999) . In other words, if employees feel that work-life is not balanced, they may leave the job and seek ''quality of life''.",

It includes ''benefits'' such as leave for getting married, compassionate leave, holiday house, office parties, and training courses for personal development, etc. Many benefits are designed to be family-friendly to balance shift workers' family needs due to their erratic job nature. However, from the perspective of work-life balance in today's working environment, these ''benefits'' tend to be segmented and can only be regarded as a piece-meal approach to staff support. In a workplace that is characterized by long and irregular working hours, are the existing ''family-friendly'' related practices adequate for employees to deal with their daily family responsibilities? Do they take into account and individual's needs?",

The government's recent implementation of 5-day work week 2 for civil servants has also stirred up many discussions and one primary focus is on whether the private sector should also implement a 5-day work week. As the issue of work-life balance is now receiving greater attention in the community, undoubtedly, many organizations and employees across different industries are gradually becoming aware of practices for balancing work and life. Some companies may copy the best practices and some may simply focus on the 5-day work week alone due to the complex options available. Whether this is a solution to work-life balance is unclear because it is not a ''onesize-fits-all'' strategy and also poses significant financial implications.",

The contribution of this study is to explore the perception of work-life balance issues among hotel employees in the Hong Kong hotel industry. By understanding their perspectives, hotel management can derive ways to improve staff productivity. As the jargon goes, ''Happy Employees Produce Happy Customers.'' By conducting this study, the findings should help both hotel managements and employees understand this intangible concept in human resources management. Specifically, the four objectives are to examine hotel employees' perception over work-life balance issues; investigate any underlying dimensions influencing hotel employees in facing the work-life balance dilemma; investigate which factors affect overall perception of work-life balance; and make suggestions to hotel management on devising policies on work-life balance.",

Due to the everchanging social, economic and legislative conditions in different countries, there is literally no universal definition on work-life balance. Much discussion about the concept was triggered by the entry of a greater number of women into the workforce. Dual income parents, therefore, struggle to balance their work and family responsibilities. Many firms started to feature ''familyfriendly'' related practices such as child care facility provision for workers with babies or school age children. Some exemplars of good practice also include paid maternity leave or opportunities to work more flexibly (Pocock, 2005) .",

Hence, employees who are single with no children may have other commitments within the community. There are also documented attempts to categorize employees' needs according to the broad groups they belong to: baby boomers, Generation X, Generation Y or the PC generation. Consequently, using the broad term ''family-friendly'' is too narrow a term and can, therefore, alienate some employees in today's environment (Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, 2007b) . Taking a step into the outer reaches of work and life, ''work-life balance policies'' and ''workplace flexibility programs'' are now increasingly used to collectively refer to a combination of initiatives designed to address individual's needs. Thus, work-life balance should be defined in the direction of ''people having a measure of control over when, where and how they work. It is achieved when an individual's right to a fulfilled life inside and outside paid work is accepted and respected as a norm to the mutual benefit of the individual, business and society'' (Employers and work-life balance, 2007) .",

Due to the phenomena of chronic labor shortage, role overload, long and irregular working hours exacerbated by considerable pressure over an extended time period, the prevalence of burnout is higher in service industries. This is so because one's job involves a high degree of interaction with clients (Vallen, 1993) . A survey in the Human Resource Management International Digest (2002) indicated that managers who suffer from burnout are relatively young, under 40 years of age, and, most likely, working in front office or food and beverage service. A correlation of high burnout to high turnover was also recorded (Buick and Thomas, 2001) . Thus, larger hospitality organizations in the U.K. or the U.S. are increasingly adopting sophisticated family-friendly practices to become an employer of choice (Doherty, 2004) . It is the workplace which becomes a matter of issue in the case of poor performance, low morale or increased absenteeism irrespective of the source of employees' problem.",

Moreover, in many companies, promotion depend on how late employees remain in the office rather than how productive or efficient they are (Taylor, 2006) . Fortunately, following the wave of 5-day work schemes in Asia, the Hong Kong government finally took the step forward to implement a 5-day work week policy in the hope of reducing work pressure and ''to bolster civil service morale, promote social harmony and bring about positive impact on the community'' (JobsDB, 2006) .",

Job vacancies and employee turnover rates continued to stay high in 2006 (HKIHRM, 2007c) . It is now a polarized situation where employees hop around for better career prospects as well as pay and benefits. A recent survey on Hong Kong people also indicated that 83% of respondents believed work-life balance is important in today's workplace (HKIHRM, 2006a; Mahtani, 2006) . This paradigm shift in the attitude of workforce, who now believe in family roles and responsibilities as well as physical and emotional well-being, is not to be overlooked.

A good management system can also be achieved by a well-designed roster system, job re-design and cooperation between departments aiming to facilitate a smooth handover of duties. For example, a front desk officer would be able to handover their duties to the next shift worker and leave on time on a normal business day instead of following up unnecessary matters with the Accounts Department. However, very often, line managers are the ones that can ''make or break'' the policy and may affect how the system works. A matter of face may develop implicitly among the team because of the inappropriate practice by the manager. Worst of all, a non-supportive environment would be cultivated among team members. Whether an employee could be released from work on time to provide him/her more free time would require the line managers' awareness on supervising flexibility and building up a bond of trust and cooperation.",

A common example being widely adopted in western countries is the option of working fewer hours at a pro-rated salary and benefits. For example, a half-time job provides the flexibility for an employee to consider working 4 h less everyday but keeping the 5-day or 6-day work week pattern. Employees can trade off their salary in exchange for more free time with the huge benefit of job security. The reason why employees tend to project a neutral stance on this factor but leaning towards the other side is because this kind of work arrangement is not common in Hong Kong. Though there are casual laborers commonly found in the hotel industry, they are regarded as ''stand-by'' staffs who are not employed permanently or on a contractual basis.
