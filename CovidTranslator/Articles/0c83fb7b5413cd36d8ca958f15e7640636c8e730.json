Isolating and culturing PED virus (PEDV) allow investigations into its pathogenesis and the development of vaccines and diagnostic assays. In this study, we successfully isolated two PEDV isolates (QIAP1401 and QIAP1402) from naturally infected piglets at Jeju-do, Korea. Viral propagation was confirmed in Vero cells based on cytopathic effect, immunofluorescence assay, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and electron microscopic analyses. The QIAP401 isolate propagated well in Vero cells for 70 passages, with titers of 10 6.5 to 10 7.0 50% tissue culture infectious dose/mL, which increased gradually with passaging. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the QIAP1401 isolate were determined and compared with those of other PEDV isolates. The QIAP1401 isolate was determined to be closely related to the USA/Minnesota271/2014 strain (> 99.9% nucleotide similarity) that was isolated in the USA in 2014. Phylogenetic analysis based on several PEDV genes suggested that a new PEDV variant is circulating in the Korean swine industry, with 93.08% similarity to the SM98 strain isolated in 1998. In addition, the QIAP1401 strain showed strong virulence in 3-day-old piglets and 11-week-old growing pigs.",

Since PEDV was first isolated (CV777 strain) in Belgium in 1978 [19] , PED outbreaks have been identified regularly in Europe and Asia, including Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, and Vietnam [7, 10, 20] . More recently, a PED outbreak occurred suddenly in the USA in 2013 and spread to Canada and Mexico [1, 17] . Since a live-attenuated PEDV vaccine was developed from a Korean PEDV isolate (SM98 strain) obtained from naturally infected piglets in Korea in 1998, PED vaccines have been used in pig farms to prevent PED outbreaks [11] . However, PED continues to be a major threat to the Korean pork industry [21] . In March 2014, a large number of PEDV infections occurred unexpectedly in many Korean pig farms, which had a significant economic impact on swine farms due to a high mortality rate among newborn piglets [12] .",

The PEDV genome is composed of at least seven open reading frames (ORFs), encoding three non-structural proteins (ORF1a, 1b, and ORF3) and four structural proteins; spike (S), envelope, membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S glycoprotein mediates neutralizing antibodies in pigs and viral attachment to target cells and has been reported to bind to carbohydrate (sialic acid) and proteinaceous (aminopeptidase N) cell surface molecules [14] . The M protein has an important role in assembly of the viral nucleocapsid and membrane [23] . The N protein binds to viral RNA and provides a structural basis for the helical nucleocapsid [6] . In addition, the N protein participates in transcription of the viral genome, formation of the viral core, and packaging of viral RNA [20] . Therefore, investigation of structural proteins is suitable for elucidating the epidemiological and molecular statuses of PEDV isolates.",

Growing pure PEDV in a cell culture system has been attempted in many veterinary laboratories but has proven difficult because of many factors, such as fecal toxins, other viral contaminants, and the trypsin concentration. Although PEDV can be detected in cells after one or two passages, the virus tends to lose infectivity after additional passages. A few reports are available regarding successful culture of Korean PEDV isolates since the first isolation of PEDV [11, 12, 21] . In this study, we attempted to isolate field PEDV from 30 PEDV-positive samples by using Vero cells. Two PEDV strains, designated QIAP1401 and QIAP1402, were isolated successfully, and the QIAP1401 strain was passaged 70 times in cell culture. We characterized the biological properties of the QIAP1401 strain during serial passage, and the nucleotide sequences of the QIAP1401 strain structural genes were determined after specific passages to evaluate genetic relationships. In addition, we investigated the pathogenicity of the QIAP1401 strain in 3-day-old piglets and 11-week-old pigs.",

Two PEDV isolates, designated QIAP1401 and QIAP1402, grew successfully in Vero cells inoculated with small intestinal samples from piglets from the Jeju-do pig farms (collected 26 May 2014). As shown in Fig. 1 , clear CPEs, characterized by cell fusion and large syncytia, were observed in the QIAP1401 and QIAP1402 isolates after the second passage. The supernatants from the two isolates were analyzed by the rapid detection kit and were positive for PEDV presence. No difference in CPEs was observed between the QIAP1401 and QIAP1402 isolates. The two PEDV isolates were further passaged serially to confirm efficient propagation. Distinct CPEs were usually observed in Vero cells infected with each isolate within 30 h post-inoculation, and large cells containing many nuclei and floating cells were observed over time. After fixing the cells with cold acetone and staining with the 7G7 monoclonal antibody, specific fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm of Vero cells infected with QIAP1401 and QIAP1402 (Fig. 2) . The QIAP1401 strain was serially passaged 70 times in Vero cells, and the viral titers of QIAP1401-P10, -P40, and -P70 cultured in roller bottles were 10 6.5 , 10 6.8 , and 10 7.0 TCID 50 /mL, respectively (panel A in Fig.  2 ).

PEDV particles from the QIAP1401 strain purified by gradient sucrose density centrifugation were examined by EM.

As a result, several Korean isolates, such as the KPV1405, KNU1307, and BM1 strains isolated from the feces of naturally infected piglets, were reported [4, 12] . We attempted to isolate PEDV from 30 intestinal homogenates and obtained the QIAP1401 and QIP1402 strains from Vero cells. They were confirmed to be PEDV based on CPEs, IFA, EM, and RT-PCR results. An appropriate trypsin concentration and Vero cell line were essential for isolating PEDV in cell culture [8, 13] . In this study, we found that ATCC-CCL81 Vero cells were more suitable for propagating field PEDV than were ATCC-1586 Vero cells, and 2 \u03bcg/mL trypsin at 37 o C for 1 h before inoculation into the Vero cells and medium containing 1 or 1.5 \u03bcg/mL crystalized trypsin were critical for propagating PEDV (data not shown). Subsequently, one of the new PEDV isolates has been used to develop a vaccine candidate for live and inactivated PEDV vaccines. New vaccines based on the current strains are needed because the PEDV vaccine based on the SM98 or DR13 strains might be less related antigenically to the re-emerged PEDV strains [2, 4, 18, 22] .One of the two isolates in this study was serially propagated 70 times in Vero cells. The viral titer of QIAP1401 reached 10 7.0 TCID 50 /mL by passage 70, indicating that the QIAP1401-P70 strain was adapted to the Vero cells and could be used as a vaccine strain.",

These strains were confirmed to be variants of the PEDV strain belonging to the G2 group, indicating that the QIAP1401 strain is a variant of the strains used in traditional vaccines such as SM98 or DR13. If this relationship is factual, it remains unclear how the PEDV variant was introduced into Korea. A molecular epidemiologist suggested that the Korean PEDV variant strains may have been transmitted directly or indirectly from USA PEDV strains that circulated in 2013 and 2014 [3] . The SM98-1 strain has a 52-nucleotide deletion between the end of the S protein and the start of ORF3 [12] . The QIAP1401 strain was passaged 70 times in Vero cells and showed 11 amino acid changes in the four structural proteins after passage 20 compared with those of the original QIAP1401 strain; these 11 mutated amino acids persisted for 60 passages. Only one amino acid change in the M protein was identified at passage 60, indicating that the QIAP1401 strain is genetically stable over serial passages in Vero cells.",
