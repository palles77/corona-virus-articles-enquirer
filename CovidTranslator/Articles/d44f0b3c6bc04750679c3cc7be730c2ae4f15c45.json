For the first time, this disease was described in late 2002 in the Guangdong province (southern China), and then it spread to many other regions of the world. More than 8000 people have been infected with SARS. The morbidity and mortality of SARS is rather high (mortality rate, up to 6-15%). The etiological agent of the disease, SARS coronavirus (SARS-cv), was identified by WHO experts, who determined its genome sequence and primers for molecular biological diagnosis [1] .",

It was also reported that 13% of those who caught animals in the Guandong province and had no history of SARS had IgG-antibodies against SARS-cv. In three control groups, these antibodies were found only in 1 \u2212 3% of subjects [4] .

The temperature reaction of mice allowed the value ID 50 to be calculated by the method of Kerber: in the cases of intraperitoneal and intramuscular injection, this value was 6.83 lg and 6.5lg, respectively. Therefore, the SARS-cv titer in mice expressed in /ml units was higher than the SARS-cv titer expressed in /ml units. In other words, mice are more sensitive to this virus than a cell culture. Although in mice receiving intraperitoneal injection of SARS-cv, both the ID 50 and mean body temperature were larger than control, no fatal outcomes were observed in this group of mice. However, there were two fatal outcomes in the group of mice receiving intramuscular injections of SARS-cv: on day 10 (the first dilution of the virus) and on day 14 (the second dilution of the virus).
