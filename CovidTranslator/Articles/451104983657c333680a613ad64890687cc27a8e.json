This varies from recognition of the vital importance of safe water, through waste disposal (nuclear, medical, industrial, household) and sewage disposal, to global climate change. The direct health effects of poor sanitation are horrendous in the cost to lives and health. Although progress is being made, high levels of danger to rural populations remain, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In the industrialized countries, the sanitary revolution of the nineteenth century was a fundamental achievement of public health, resulting in a doubling of life expectancy.",

Urbanization, demographic, and epidemiological shifts are associated with growing populations with health needs related to longterm diseases and conditions. These can be aggravated by environmental pollution, which presents a severe challenge in rapidly developing societies with urban crowding, air and other pollution, and fossil fuel issues. Increasing consumption associated with increasing per capita incomes creates demands for increased food supply that will be difficult to meet. Agricultural reform with improved water management and smallholder methods including better transportation, marketing, and wider use of genetically modified foods will be essential to meet these demands. Such demands are occurring in an environment of decreasing water supply, uncertainty as to climate effects, and the continuing struggle to lift people from poverty and its adverse health effects. Some successes are impressive, with many mid-level income countries achieving better education and health, whereas in some newly wealthy countries the rapid increases in productivity and income coexist with large sectors of the population remaining in rural poverty and decay.",

Moreover, within the same community there will be wide variation in actual exposure levels to the toxic agent. The agent may affect different populations or subgroups differently. There may be genetic and social factors at play as well. In cases where there is a long time lapse between exposure and resultant disease, and many independent variables, it may be very difficult to attribute the disease to a specific exposure, as in the case of asbestos exposure and mesothelioma. The risk of asbestos exposure was compounded by cigarette smoking, affecting the workers directly exposed. But asbestos also affected the families of workers, as well as people in the community secondarily exposed to inhalation of the carcinogenic fibers, with residual asbestos material having been discarded or still present in roofing and many other applications. The cumulative evidence established the causal relationship and justified action to eliminate asbestos use in work settings and the wider environment.",

Typically, the joint pain lasts for a few days or weeks, during which time the pain is severe and incapacitating. Most cases recover, but some individuals experience long-lasting joint pain or eye, neurological, or heart complications, which severely debilitate a patient. In regions where dengue is endemic, chikungunya is often misdiagnosed for dengue owing to their similar clinical manifestations. Infected female mosquitoes bites cause human-to-human virus transmission, with risk linked to the distance between mosquito breeding areas and human habitation.

The aim of drinking water quality regulations should be to ensure that the consumer has access to sustainable, sufficient, and safe drinking water. l Enabling legislation should provide broad powers and scope to related regulations and include public health protection objectives, such as the prevention of waterborne disease and the provision of an adequate supply of drinking water.

The wastewater is sprayed over trickling filters or beds of crushed stone covered with a slime containing various types of microbes. These microbes absorb the organic material and act to break it down into its various components. The sewage is then processed by the activated sludge method, carried out by introducing bacteria-containing sludge into a tank of wastewater along with compressed air. The waste is then agitated and mixed for 4-10 hours. The microbes are adsorbed to suspended particles and oxidize the organic material. After this process, the sludge, consisting of masses of bacteria, settles out into the tank. The sludge is then removed and recycled into the next tank of wastewater.",

The Greek city-states had ordinances against dumping refuse in or near cities, providing waste disposal sites for this purpose. In medieval European cities, garbage as well as human and animal wastes were discarded into the streets and areas surrounding the home. In the thirteenth century, Parisians were forbidden to throw waste on the streets and had to dump it outside the walls of the city. In 1388, the English parliament prohibited waste disposal in public waterways. During the industrial revolution, medieval cities evolved into working-class slums.

These techniques are part of the engineering of community infrastructure. Seawater dumping is still practiced in some countries, but increasing global concern about the effects of such practices on the ecology of the lakes and oceans makes this solution unacceptable. Landfill is the most prevalent method of solid waste disposal. It involves spreading garbage in layers 8-10 feet (2-3 m) deep and covering them with a thin layer of soil. This method is adequate if well planned and supervised and has the benefit that methane gas produced by anaerobic decomposition can be recovered for use. The problems of seepage of toxic materials and potentially explosive gas accumulation require careful assessment of landfill sites and limit the potential of landfills to serve as a sustainable, feasible option. Limited possibilities for suitable landfill locations in large urban concentrations make this method of disposal a serious urban planning problem. Sanitary landfill is expensive because of the cost of collection and transportation, the land value, and the human resources required. Landfill under sanitary conditions requires compaction of waste and covering by well-spread yet compacted earth far from ground and surface water. The site must be fenced to prevent scavenging by people, animals, and off-hours dumpers. The landfill should be located away from residential areas, be well maintained and tidy, and have well-paved and well-drained access roads. It should be seeded, in completed areas, with grass and trees to control erosion, and must be maintained by well-trained sanitarians.",

Children are especially vulnerable to these environmental contaminants. Clinical effects appeared particularly in children and at lower blood concentration levels than previously thought to be significant. \"Acceptable\" levels were lowered and lead abatement programs introduced. These programs were especially needed in urban slum areas, where children were exposed to lead-based paints in older homes and heavy urban traffic.

The two primary classifications are non-ionizing and ionizing radiation. Non-ionizing radiation indicates radiation in which there is sufficient amount of energy to allow atoms in a molecule to vibrate, but there is not enough to remove electrons. The properties of non-ionizing radiation are used for everyday applications, such as microwaves, radio broadcasting, and infrared heat lamps. Ionizing radiation represents higher levels of energy. Consequently, a charged part of the molecule has the ability to break free from the atom, thus creating particles with a charge, or ions. Ionizing radiation includes particulate radiation of alpha and beta particles, as well as electromagnetic X-rays and gamma rays. Alpha particles are easily stopped by a thin sheet of paper, while beta and gamma radiation can penetrate barriers both inside and outside the body. Ionizing radiation can dislodge atoms or parts of atoms and destroy chemical bonds. This can adversely affect living organisms, especially vulnerable fetal cells, resulting in mutations or carcinogenesis. Figure 9 .5 illustrates radiation energy levels on a spectrum.

At high doses, ionizing radiation increases chemical activity inside cells and can lead to health risks, including cancer.\" Ionizing radiation is characterized by having enough energy to be able pull away tightly attached electrons from their atoms. It includes high-energy electromagnetic radiation, such as X-rays and gamma rays, which are of shorter wavelength and higher energy than UV or visible radiation. It also includes high-energy particles such as electrons, neutrons, protons, and alpha particles. Excessive exposure to these forms of radiation has early and late effects depending on dose and the tissue exposed. Early effects of exposure to high doses of radiation may be fatal owing to acute damage to the gastrointestinal, erythropoietic (blood-forming), and central nervous systems. Late effects include malignant disease such as leukemia and birth defects. Background radiation is composed of both natural and artificial sources of radiation. Approximately 81 percent comes from nature, while the remaining 19 percent can be attributed to non-natural sources. The principal sources of radiation exposure for the general public can be broken down as follows: radon (55 percent), external (15 percent), internal (11 percent), medical (15 percent), consumer (3 percent), and other (1 percent). Exposure to ionizing radiation from artificial sources is largely derived from medical procedures. Moreover, natural background radiation is composed of cosmic radiation, terrestrial radiation, and internal radiation. Cosmic radiation is attributed to the sun and stars, which transmit a continuous flow of radiation to Earth. The terrestrial radiation that affects humans comes from the Earth itself, as radioactive substances are naturally present in soil, rock, air, and water. Lastly, humans are exposed to internal radiation, which originates inside the body and is present from birth; people are, in fact, a source of exposure to those around them.",

The process of alpha emission can be hazardous to health. This is characterized by a change occurring in the nucleus and a particle being released, resulting in a decay product. The majority of alpha emission takes place naturally in the environment. When soil, minerals, or rock formations are disrupted (such as during mineral extraction), this creates a risk of environmental and human exposure. For instance, high levels of uranium and radium are found in uranium mining wastes. When they rise to the surface, they may contaminate surface water or become airborne. The severity of health effects is highly dependent on the route of exposure. Alpha particles do not have the energy to penetrate the outer skin layer, so exposure external to the body is significantly less harmful than internal exposure. However, if alpha emitters are inhaled or swallowed, or enter the bloodstream, this is a cause for concern. The radiation affects living tissue and may increase the risk of developing cancer, more specifically lung cancer if alpha emitters have been inhaled.",

They are important in diagnosis, imaging, and treatment, such as treatment of thyroid disorders and drug metabolism research. Both human-made and naturally occurring beta emitters exist, with some present in our bodies. Health may be compromised when energetic particles are released. Sources of beta particle exposure vary, and may result from a nuclear reactor accident or as a consequence of a patient taking radioactive iodine. The patient will release beta particles and therefore must adhere to a rigid protocol to prevent exposure to family members. Similar to alpha particles, the route of exposure is important in determining the severity of the health outcome. Inhalation and ingestion are very serious, as particles in contact with living tissue can harm the molecules and disturb cell function. Beta particles are significantly smaller than alpha particles. As a result, they can travel deeper into tissues, causing more widespread cellular damage. In addition, if released from a strong enough source, when beta particles come into contact with skin, they can cause irritation, reddening, or burning. Although radiation from beta particles can result in both acute and chronic health problems, chronic effects are significantly more common. The major health outcome from this radiation is cancer, which typically develops from a relatively low degree of exposure over a long period. It follows a dose-response relationship, in which a higher dose is associated with a higher risk of cancer. While some beta emitters disperse throughout the body, others concentrate in particular organs.",

            "text": "The third class of ionizing radiation is gamma rays. This form of radiation is extremely high energy. Gamma photons are characterized as having no mass and no charge, and being able to travel at the speed of light. They have the power to penetrate many types of objects and materials, including human tissue. As a result, dense, heavy materials are often used as shield to retard or halt gamma photons. Gamma rays and X-rays present similar health risks, their difference lying in the portion of the atom from which they originate. Radionuclides that emit gamma photons are the most commonly used sources of radiation. Some of their uses include treatment of cancer, pasteurization of foods, sterilization of medical tools, and measuring soil density in construction areas. Radioactive isotopes are used in diagnostic examinations, for instance, to obtain images of bone, liver, or brain. For the general population, the majority of gamma exposure comes from natural radionuclides, typically present in soil and water. Further sources include meats and foods that contain high levels of potassium, such as bananas. The majority of gamma and X-ray exposure is external, and the danger lies in the rays' ability to travel far through air and deep into human tissue, putting all organs as risk. For this reason, when X-rays are needed for dental or medical purposes, they are typically carried out in a controlled, well-planned environment. Although less common, radionuclides can release gamma rays that may be ingested with water or food, or inhaled, resulting in internal risks. Determined by the source, the radionuclide can follow different pathways, as it is either absorbed in body tissue or excreted through urine or feces.",

Radiation sickness in people exposed to radiation from the atomic bomb explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and nuclear accidents ranged in severity, with a variety of short-and long-term responses. The long-term responses have been less severe than originally feared. Ionizing radiation of humans can act as a mutagen, a carcinogen, and a teratogen. It can cause cataracts, impaired fertility, premature aging, and skin damage. Radiation-induced cancer can occur as little as 2-5 years after exposure, or following a latency period of up to 25 years after exposure. Greater risk occurs for those exposed in utero. X-ray-induced disease from excess exposure, faulty equipment, or human error is a hazard of medical care. There is perhaps no safe exposure to ionizing radiation beyond atmospheric background, and any extra exposure should be limited, with prudent exposure to X-rays and limited exposure to atomic radiation from domestic or military uses.",

Documentation of occupational diseases began in 1700 by Bernardino Ramazzini (1633-1714) (see Chapter 1). Historic examples of work-related health hazards and diseases include scurvy among sailors, cancer of the scrotum specific to chimney sweeps in nineteenth-century England, black lung in coal miners, mercury poisoning in hat makers, byssinosis in cotton mill workers, and mesothelioma in asbestos workers. The list is long and extends to musculoskeletal injuries and hepatitis B in hospital workers, spinal disorders in typists, and medial neuritis (carpal tunnel syndrome) in computer users. Interventions vary widely, from the banning of asbestos use to modifying the office work environment through better chairs, exercise breaks, and ergonomic training of workers. During the early part of the nineteenth century, the harsh working conditions of children, women, and other workers led to parliamentary action to regulate mines and factories, improving conditions generally. The first factory inspectors in the UK were appointed in 1833 to administer the provisions of the Factory and Workshops Acts. In 1898, Thomas Legge became the first medical doctor appointed to the post of Chief Factory Inspector in the UK. He articulated the basic public health approach to workers' health and established the principle that management is responsible for the health of the employees. These issues are termed Legge's axioms and are still relevant to the field of occupational health today (Table 9 .5).",

Workers have lower death rates than the general population because they are demographically different from the general population and even epidemiologically different from a population matched for age and gender. This is due to the fact that there is a process of selection of workers that excludes the severely ill and disabled from employment. The selection process continues with attrition of unhealthy people from the workplace. This is termed the healthy worker effect and is a factor that needs to be considered in occupational health studies and practice. Death rates or other population-based norms from the general population may be inappropriate for comparison if this effect is not taken into account.

New and interesting technological tools are being developed in an effort to prevent or limit an employee's physical distress (Box 9.33). Thus, the same tasks can be achieved with significant less risk of injury, which in turn reduces workers' compensation claims as well as lost workdays. In the USA, major progress has been made in workplace safety. While this is a great achievement, the importance of this public health measure crosses all borders, and there are advances to be made in occupational health globally. Progress in reduced mortality from occupational injuries is shown in Figure   9 .6.

Chronic forms of plumbism or lead poisoning cause mental dullness, headache, memory loss, neurological defects (wrist drop), anemia, and a blue line on the gums. Lead toxicity has been a traditional health problem of glaziers and potters because of lead use in the manufacturing process. Wines or rum produced and stored in lead containers or in pewter (lead-tin alloy) utensils were known to be associated with the \"dry gripes\" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The Devonshire colic, described in 1776 by George Baker, was widespread for more than 100 years in parts of England where cider was made and stored in lead containers.",

It is an important component of the chemical industry because of its flame-retardant properties, low cost, and many end-product uses. It is also a carcinogen causing liver, brain, and lung cancer, as well as spontaneous abortion. Vinyl chlorides are dangerous primarily when inhaled or ingested. Vinyl chloride usage increased from the 1930s and more dramatically after the end of World War II until the 1970s. In the 1960s, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was shown to be associated with Raynaud's phenomenon and later with malignancies, including hemangiosarcoma of the liver. The carcinogenicity of PVC was established as a result of the review of all evidence in 1974 by the US Office of Technology Assessment and OSHA. Scientists concluded that there was no safe level of exposure to vinyl chlorides. OSHA adopted 1 part per million as the maximum possible dose. While the risk assessment issues are still controversial, reduction of exposure to workplace carcinogens such as vinyl chloride is the accepted standard of modern occupational health.",

The costs to industry of reducing exposure levels were less than 25 percent of expected costs because of unanticipated innovations in the production process.",

Studies in the USA based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) showed elevated BLLs in 88.2 percent of children aged 1-5 years in 1976-1980 (13.5 million children). The rate of elevated BLL fell to 8.6 percent in 1988-1991 (1.7 million children), 4.4 percent in 1991-1994 (850,000 children), and 2.2 percent in 1999-2000 (434,000 children). The lower level accepted as a marker by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was reduced to < 5 \u03bcg/l in May 2012. The reduction in prevalence of elevated BLL was due to a number of factors, including: l reduction in use of lead in gasoline since 1976 l reduced use of food and soft drink cans containing lead solder l reduced use of lead-based house paint l national standards for lead exposure in industry l ban on use of lead soldering on household plumbing l screening of children as part of routine child care and intervention where elevated BLLs are found l lead abatement by county health departments through removal of lead-based paint in older housing l increased provider and parental awareness of leadinduced permanent brain damage hazard l strong positions of the CDC, American Academy of Pediatrics, state and county health departments, and child advocacy organizations l increased public awareness l regulation and elimination of lead paint on child toys",

Employment and working conditions in the formal or informal economy embrace other important determinants, including, working hours, salary, workplace policies concerning maternity leave, health promotion and protection provisions\" (WHO, 2012) .WHO is implementing a Global Plan of Action on Workers ' Health 2008 ' Health -2017 Occupational health has become an international issue as the global economy enables the transfer of manufacturing from one country to another with great speed and ease (Box 9.30). This is often motivated by lower wages, and also by lower occupational and environmental regulatory controls and less stringent or non-existent legal protection against toxic exposures and child labor in developing countries. Transfer of occupational hazards from industrialized to non-industrialized countries has become an issue in international cooperation and trade agreements. Developed countries have stricter environmental regulations and worker organization than developing countries that are anxious for job-producing industry at any price.In 2000, occupational risk factors were responsible worldwide for 37 percent of back pain, 16 percent of hearing loss, 13 percent of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), 11 percent of asthma, 8 percent of injuries, 9 percent of lung cancer, and 2 percent of leukemia. These risks at work caused 850,000 deaths worldwide and resulted in the loss of about 24 million years of healthy life. Needlestick injuries accounted for about 40 percent of hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections and 4.4 percent of HIV infections in health care workers. Exposure to occupational hazards accounts for a significant proportion of the global burden of disease and injury, which could be substantially reduced through application of proven risk prevention strategies.",

            "text": "In the USA, workers' health benefits cost more than the steel to make a car. As a result, there is a growing interest on the part of both management and workers in promoting workers' health through improved nutritional monitoring of canteens and cafeterias, antismoking activities, and physical fitness programs. The management interest in a healthier workforce to contain rising health care costs is part of the modern corporate culture. The primary responsibility, however, legally and morally, lies with management, in addition to protecting the worker by monitoring risks, providing a safe environment, and providing care at the time of injury (Box 9.31).More than 23 million Americans have asthma and a further 13.6 million have COPD. The workplace environment often results in exposure to many chronic respiratory hazards among workers. Examples of respiratory hazards identified in the past 10 years include butter-flavouring chemicals; minifibers (flock) of nylon, rayon, and polypropylene; and dust from the World Trade Center. Analysis of workplace asthma in the USA showed that among adults an annual average of 1.4 million cases of workplace-related asthma could be prevented (Box 9.32).Occupational injuries and illnesses are social as well as engineering and management concerns. Compensation, litigation, class-action suits, and union action are all associated with increasing awareness of toxic and trauma effects on workers, and court decisions regarding management liability. The field is made more complex because some occupational illness may occur long after the exposure: silicosis, asbestos-related mesothelioma, and asbestosis may develop after a long latency of up to 20-30 years following exposure. Anticipation -dealing with potential disease and injury to include preparation for prevention as facilities are planned or renovated. l Surveillance and monitoring -assuring timely and accurate identification, reporting, and recording of occupational disease and injury; medical surveillance: passive or active and industrial hygiene and safety. l Right to know -for workers, health professionals, community at large. l Epidemiological analysis -analyzing collected data; linking exposure to outcome data helps to locate trends, clusters, associations, and causes of disease and injury for more in-depth investigation and prevention.l Exposure reduction -minimizing toxic exposure, to prevent approaching or exceeding established limits. l Substitution -substituting less toxic substances.l Awareness -promoting awareness at government, management, community, worker, and consumer levels.l Government regulation -on-site supervision by regulatory agencies; publication of standards of exposure and \"good practices\".

Occupational asthma is new-onset asthma attributed to the workplace environment. WRA is a preventable occupational lung disease associated with serious adverse health and socioeconomic outcomes.Among workers with similar occupational exposures, WRA diagnosis offers unique opportunities for prevention. The American Thoracic Society estimated that for 15 percent of US adults with asthma the condition is attributable to occupational factors.To estimate current asthma prevalence and the proportion of asthma that is WRA, CDC analyzed data from the 2006-2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 38 states and the District of Columbia (DC).Among ever-employed adults with current asthma, the overall proportion of WRA was 9.0 percent, ranging from 4.8 to 14.1 percent in different states. Proportions of WRA were highest among people aged 45-64 years (12.7 percent), blacks (12.5 percent), and people of other races (11.8 percent). Columbia, 2006 -2009 .
