However, a gulf between paying markets and the endemicity of such diseases has contributed to the dearth of R&D in meeting these public health needs. While the pharmaceutical industry views emerging economies as potential new markets, most of the world's poorest bottom billion now reside in middle-income countries-a fact that has complicated tiered access arrangements. However, product development partnerships-particularly those involving academic institutions and small firms-find commercial opportunities in pursuing even neglected diseases; and a growing pharmaceutical sector in BRICS countries offers hope for an indigenous base of innovation. Such innovation will be shaped by 1) access to building blocks of knowledge; 2) strategic use of intellectual property and innovative financing to meet public health goals; 3) collaborative norms of open innovation; and 4) alternative business models, some with a double bottom line. Facing such resource constraints, LMICs are poised to develop a new, more resource-effective model of innovation that holds exciting promise in meeting the needs of global health.",

Leading communicable diseases from AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria to diarrheal diseases, measles, and lower respiratory infections claim upwards of eleven million lives in these countries each year [1] . The burden falls disproportionately not only on some countries, but also on vulnerable parts of the population. Notably, 95 percent of deaths from respiratory infections and 98 percent of deaths from diarrheal diseases occur in LMICs [2] ; and diarrhea, pneumonia, measles, and malaria take many lives of children under five. Similarly, infectious diseases like schistosomiasis, hookworm and malaria contribute to anemia, worsening outcomes both of mother and child in pregnancy, while syphilis also adversely affects neonatal mortality. As for diseases that make up substantial portions of global disease burden-HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria-over 95 percent of the deaths caused by each of these diseases are also in LMICs. The toll of infectious diseases comes in mortality and morbidity, lost work productivity and economic losses, and the drag effect on those trapped or tipped into poverty by illness.",

            "text": "Delivering Existing Health Technologies to Those in Need--Artemisinin Combination Therapy for Malaria The Affordable Medicines Facility-Malaria (AMFm) has sought to stem irrational treatment approaches to malaria. AMFm worked to negotiate for lower prices of artemisinin combination treatment (ACT) with manufacturers, subsidize the purchase of ACTs through copayments, and support interventions that encourage rational use of ACTs. By sharply reducing the retail prices of ACTs, the initiative hoped to displace oral artemisinin monotherapies and other medicines, such as chloroquine and sulfadoxinepyrimethamine, to which resistance had emerged. UNITAID, the Gates Foundation and DFID supported the piloting of this intervention with US$216 million while the Global Fund complemented this, committing up to US$127 million towards supporting interventions for scaling up ACT use effectively [12] . The premise and preliminary findings behind this pilot illustrate the complexity of delivering even existing innovations to those in need. Early findings from the Health Action International pricing survey in six African countries showed that the AMFm price bested the originator brand and the lowest-priced generic, approaching but not yet consistently beating the prices of irrational alternatives, like chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine [13] . In less than a year though, six out of eight pilot countries met or exceeded benchmarks for availability, price and market share of quality-assured ACTs, both in rural and urban areas [14] . Efforts in Tanzania showed that accredited drug dispensing outlets could complement these upstream interventions by increasing access to and dispensing of subsidized artemisinin combination therapy [15] . However, the volatility in artemisinin supply upstream has caused significant price fluctuations in the pricing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of this drug. Though it may not offset entirely the greater demand for artemisinin from an expanded AMFm, the anticipated advent of artemisinin, sourced from microbial production, by late 2012 is a technology that may help stabilize and secure the supply of this critical drug for ACT [16] .",

Or such health technologies might require being lyophilized, kept in cold chain storage, or perhaps soon stabilized in silk films [17] for transport in tropical climates.

This is in sharp contrast to two decades ago when over 90 percent of the poorest of the poor lived in low-income countries. Most of these poor people live in countries such as India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Nigeria, which have graduated from low-to middle-income status [22] . This has implications for pharmaceutical innovation and access. For example, in establishing tiering schemes that give preferential access, from licensed technology to product prices, this tension has made firms reluctant to offer such breaks to middle-income countries. This is reflected in the challenges that the Medicines Patent Pool faces in recruiting companies to license voluntarily their HIV/AIDS drugs for generic production as part of fixed-dose combinations. Similarly, the anchoring of the GlaxoSmithKlineinitiated Pool for Open Innovation Against Tropical Neglected Diseases and WIPO Re:Search Consortium--both efforts to pool building blocks of knowledge and to license them royalty-free to those working on neglected diseases--places limits on geographic coverage to only least developed countries as a starting condition.",

The stark reality is that less than a quarter of all biomedical research publications and less than a third of all clinical trials in Africa even relate to diseases that comprise nearly 50 percent of the burden of disease on the continent [23] . The same study found that both the research institutions most productive in publishing journal articles and filing patents were concentrated in a few countries in Africa (notably South Africa, Nigeria and Egypt). Examining patterns of collaboration on biomedical publications, over threequarters of these journal articles were co-authored with collaborators, but only 5.4 percent engaged institutions in more than one African country while the preponderant majority of articles involved collaborators in Europe or the United States. This pattern of collaboration, in part, motivated the formation of the African Network for Drugs and Diagnostics Innovation, with its focus on intra-African coordination and collaboration on R&D.",

Half of these projects were conducted by multinational firms, invariably on a \"no profit-no loss\" basis. Projects from the other half were conducted on a commercial basis by small-scale entities: small and medium enterprises, developing country firms and academic research institutions.

Multinational drug firms have also begun to shift their patterns of R&D, with recent boosts in approvals of new drugs targeting orphan diseases [26] . In some respects, orphan diseases and neglected diseases may be two sides of the same coin. By value, both face small markets: orphan diseases with small numbers of patients, but treatments that may command high prices in industrialized countries; neglected diseases with millions of patients, but hopes for very low cost treatments per episode. Facing the looming cliff of patent expirations, some of these firms might also be seeing the opportunity costs of smaller markets differently than in the past.",

In another example of South-South technology transfer, Farmanguinhos, with the Indian drug manufacturer Cipla, also partnered with the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), a product development partnership, to bring to market a new fixeddosed artemisinin-based combination treatment, ASMQ, the first ACT with a three-year shelf life in tropical climates [33] .

Such technology platforms might be potentially developed for other diagnostic and therapeutic areas to accelerate innovation.

Even when publicly funded, patented inventions may not be easily accessible by other researchers or for use in disease-endemic countries. There may be even less incentive to share when such inventions are proprietary and privately funded. However, especially in the neglected disease space, both tiering and pooling arrangements have afforded greater access to needed research inputs. By tiering, preferential discounts or even royalty-free access to research inputs is provided, often bounded by field of use or geography. For AIDS drugs and many vaccines, tiered pricing arrangements offer price breaks to resource-limited countries. Further upstream, many neglected disease projects benefit from tiered licensing arrangements, whereby access to compounds otherwise inaccessible due to their proprietary nature is provided. The R&D pathway for repurposing existing drugs can be shortened considerably when such access is coupled with pre-clinical and even clinical data on these compounds.

This deposit into the pool of the European Bioinformatics Institute's ChEMBL database and the U.S. NIH PubChem database provides wide access under a Creative Commons CC0 license (work dedicated to the public domain with waiver of copyright) [41] . Tiering and pooling often work in tandem. The Medicines Patent Pool, the Pool for Open Innovation Against Neglected Tropical Diseases, and the WIPO Re:Search Consortium all represent pooling arrangements, each with different tiered access conditions on inputs into the pool. Some work by aggregating research inputs upstream in the R&D pipeline, and others recruit patented drugs downstream in the R&D pipeline. For example, the Medicines Patent Pool's mission is to secure voluntary licenses from pharmaceutical companies of HIV/AIDS drugs that might be used in new fixed-dose combinations or pediatric formulations. In so doing, the generic licensing of such combinations is meant to stir greater competition and thereby innovation and affordability of such treatments. Negotiating licenses, limited by field and geography, has proven challenging. To date, the only license with a company for AIDS medicines has been with Gilead. This license restricts manufacturing to India, but extends access to resulting products to a wider range of countries (though still excluding several middle-income countries) than under previous arrangements [42] .",

NIH has also issued guidance to grantees for the \"timely release and sharing of final research data\" for others to use [46] and for minimizing unnecessary encumbrances on the dissemination of publicly funded research tools [47] .",

From Merck's early efforts to place expressed sequence tags into the public domain to corporate participation in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Consortium, pharmaceutical firms have understood the need to harness ideas from outside their walls to fuel in-house R&D innovation. The potential application for open innovation is most evident for emerging infectious diseases, where the patenting process might be outpaced by the speed of a spreading pandemic. The need for pooling patents on SARS to enable non-exclusive licensing anticipated the potential problems of intellectual property holdings on developing a diagnostic or treatment for the illness. However, the SARS epidemic came and went before the patent pool could be launched, highlighting the potential value of open innovation norms for emerging diseases.",

Notably, India's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has embarked on the Open Source Drug Discovery (OSDD) initiative, initially focused on TB drugs. Using a web-based platform, hundreds of volunteers at a network of universities, both in India and elsewhere, have collaborated on re-annotating the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome. Their collective efforts made this possible in just four months. Supported with government funding, participants submit projects for open peer review, contribute to on-line efforts under a system of microattribution, and agree to sharing their work under a click-wrap license. In not pursuing a conventional path to drug discovery, OSDD hopes to \"bring down the cost of drug discovery significantly by knowledge sharing and constructive collaboration\" and \"to discover new chemical entities and to make them generic as soon as they are discovered, thus expediting the process of drug discovery\" [49] .",

As a result, published articles in open access journals are made available freely online without subscription barriers. A growing number of leading universities, from Harvard University to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have also established institutional, open access repositories where faculty may deposit their publications. Funders like the NIH and the Wellcome Trust have taken steps to require grantees to make available their journal publications in publicly accessible archives. The model of open access publication not only may have more universal applicability, both North and South, but also enables users to assemble relevant publications from multiple journals, without the barrier of subscription costs to each journal.",
