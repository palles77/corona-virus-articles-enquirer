Since the effectiveness of the only available tuberculosis vaccine, Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), is suboptimal, there is a strong demand to develop new tuberculosis vaccines. As tuberculosis is an airborne disease, the intranasal route of vaccination might be preferable. Live influenza virus vaccines might be considered as potential vectors for mucosal immunization against various viral or bacterial pathogens, including M. tuberculosis. We generated several subtypes of attenuated recombinant influenza A viruses expressing the 6-kDa early secretory antigenic target protein (ESAT-6) of M. tuberculosis from the NS1 reading frame. We were able to demonstrate the potency of influenza virus NS vectors to induce an M. tuberculosisspecific Th1 immune response in mice. Moreover, intranasal immunization of mice and guinea pigs with such vectors induced protection against mycobacterial challenge, similar to that induced by BCG vaccination.",

The influenza A virus contains a segmented genome consisting of eight negative-strand RNA fragments. Among them, the smallest fragment (NS), encoding two proteins (NS1 and Nep), is a suitable target for genetic manipulation. NS1 is the only nonstructural protein of the influenza virus and has been shown to tolerate relatively long insertions of more than 250 amino acids (23) . Moreover, as the NS1 protein is produced in large quantities in infected cells, expression of foreign sequences from the NS1 reading frame should result in a strong immune response against the inserted antigen. It was demonstrated that immunization of mice with NS influenza virus vectors could trigger a CD8 \u03e9 T-cell response, especially when two vectors belonging to different influenza virus subtypes were used for prime-boost immunizations (12, 39) . However, influenza virus NS vectors might be less efficient for the induction of insert-specific T-helper and antibody responses due to the intracellular localization of the NS1 protein leading to a less efficient presentation of linked antigen through the major histocompatibility complex class II pathway.",

Encouraged by the data from mouse experiments, we evaluated the potency of Flu/ESAT-6 viral vector vaccines in guinea pigs, a model more appropriate to human tuberculosis. Taking into account that guinea pigs are relatively resistant to influenza virus infection (32), the s.c. route of immunization was used in addition to i.n. application. Different groups of four guinea pigs were immunized twice with Flu/ESAT vectors or inoculated with BCG or PBS. Six weeks after the first immunization, the animals were challenged s.c. with M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Nine weeks after challenge, one out of four guinea pigs from the control group died of severe tuberculosis, whereas all vaccinated animals were progressively gaining weight (Fig. 5) . Bacterial titers in the lungs and spleens of animals immunized i.n. with BCG or Flu/ESAT-6 vectors were significantly reduced (1.2 and 0.95 log, respectively, in lungs and 1.39 and 0.97 log, respectively, in spleens) compared to those in the nonvaccinated controls (Fig.  6) . Interestingly, the bacterial reduction in the spleens achieved by s.c. vaccination (1.39 logs) with Flu/ESAT-6 vectors was superior to that achieved by the i.n. route of vaccination (0.97 log) and was at least as effective as BCG vaccination.",

As vaccination with the world's most widely used vaccine, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, varies in its protective efficacy from 0 to 80%, depending on the geographical region, there is an urgent need to develop new, more effective tuberculosis vaccines (36) .

Another trend in vaccine development includes immunization with newly discovered M. tuberculosis antigens which are absent from current BCG vaccines. It was shown that one of the most important reasons for the attenuation of the BCG vaccine is the deletion of the RD1 genome region (28) , which encodes several proteins required for cytolysis and bacterial spreading (15) . Among them, the ESAT-6 protein was shown to enhance the permeability of artificial membranes, suggesting a possible direct role in cytolysis of infected macrophages that allows the mycobacterium to spread to other cells (17, 19) . The ESAT-6 protein is secreted out of the mycobacteria at an early stage of tuberculosis infection and accomplishes its function as a heterodimer together with another culture filtrate protein, CFP-10 (10-kDa culture filtrate protein) (6) . Importantly, the ESAT-6 protein as well as other early secreted antigens appeared to be a potent immunogen inducing the Th1 immune response in animals as well as in humans (7, 8, 37, 38) .",

            "text": "In the current study, we constructed influenza virus NS vectors expressing the ESAT-6 protein and tested their potency to induce an immune response and provide protection against tuberculosis. Beside advantages associated with intranasal application and the development of a local immune response in the respiratory tract, influenza virus vectors are ideal tools for prime-boost immunizations, since several non-cross-reactive subtypes of influenza viruses are available. In our experiments, the ESAT-6 protein was delivered into the respiratory tract by using H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 Flu/ESAT-6 vectors, utilizing a prime-boost strategy and varying the subtypes, or by double immunization with a trivalent vaccine. All vectors were designed as attenuated viruses by means of truncation of their NS1 genes. Interestingly, previously obtained recombinant influenza A viruses expressing Nef and green fluorescent protein, inserted at the same position of the NS1 open reading frame, were replication deficient in mice, presumably due to an inappropriate function of the NS1 protein (12, 23) . In the case of FIG. 5 . Mean weight gain of guinea pigs. Two groups of animals were immunized twice with a trivalent Flu/ESAT-6 vaccine i.n. or s.c., respectively. One group of guinea pigs was immunized with BCG s.c. once at the time of the first immunization. Na\u00efve guinea pigs were used as the control group. Six weeks after the first immunization, the animals were challenged s.c. with M. tuberculosis H37Rv and weighed weekly. Each time point represents the mean weight gain for four guinea pigs. Error bars indicate standard errors of the means. (41) . On the other hand, the NS1 protein alone might promote the dimerization of the ESAT-6 protein in our constructs, presumably leading to an increased stability and immunogenicity of the foreign antigen. We found that Flu/ESAT-6 vectors were capable of inducing a substantial T-helper response despite the fact that the NS1 fusion protein was not secreted by infected cells or incorporated into virus particles. This effect, presumably due to the cross-priming mechanism of antigen presentation, illustrates the high vaccine potential of influenza virus NS vectors. Vaccination of mice with Flu/ESAT-6 resulted in an increased Th1 response to the ESAT-6 antigen after challenge in lymphocytes derived from the MLNs, but not in splenocytes. It should be mentioned that in our experiments, the efficacy of vaccination was tested using an i.v. challenge model. We demonstrated that i.n. vaccination, even after systemic challenge with a high dose of mycobacteria, provided a substantial level of protection, comparable to that of the BCG vaccine. Measurement of IFN-\u2425 production by T-helper cells derived from spleens of mice vaccinated with BCG or wt PR8 showed almost the same pattern of IFN-\u2425 release as in the group immunized with influenza virus vectors. In contrast to the response to ESAT-6 stimulation, splenocytes of mice immunized with influenza virus vectors stimulated with concanavalin A showed a significant increase in IFN-\u2425 production, indicating better conditions of the immune systems of the mice. Titration of bacterial loads from spleens and lungs clearly demonstrated that immunization, although providing a systemic immune response to tuberculosis, was especially effective in protecting lungs. Importantly, the immunological data were in full correlation with the bacterial counts and results of histological examination of the lung tissues. The protective effect of vaccination was also significant in guinea pigs, which are generally accepted as the most suitable model for tuberculosis vaccines. As guinea pigs are relatively resistant to influenza virus infection, animals vaccinated s.c. with Flu/ESAT-6 vectors showed higher resistance to s.c. M. tuberculosis challenge than animals with i.n. application. It would appear that s.c. immunization induces better immunity at the systemic level, which is reflected by a more significant reduction of bacterial titers in spleens than in lungs. The mechanism of antigen presentation after s.c. application of live influenza virus vectors remains to be elucidated; however, preliminary results showed that Flu/ESAT-6 viruses were capable of infecting macrophages and presumably other antigen-presenting cells involved in the dermal immunity system. The lower efficiency of i.n. immunization of guinea pigs could also be attributed to the low sensitivity of these animals to influenza virus infection (21, 32) . Nevertheless, results of animal protec-tion studies revealed the effectiveness of Flu/ESAT-6 vectors to be similar to that of conventional BCG vaccines.",

C57BL/6 mice were immunized i.n. at a 3-week interval with Flu/ESAT-6 vectors of different subtypes and combinations as indicated. Ten days after the second immunization, splenocytes were stimulated by adding the ESAT-6 protein (5 g/ml) or the ESAT-6 1-20 peptide (5 g/ml). The number of IFN-\u2425-secreting cells per 10 6 splenocytes is shown. H1, H2, and H3 indicate the subtypes of Flu/ESAT-6 viral vectors. Tri indicates the mixture of all three Flu/ESAT-6 vector subtypes, and wt indicates the PR8 wild-type virus. Error bars indicate standard errors of the means. 900 SEREINIG ET AL. CLIN.

It is known that ESAT-6 itself could have some homo-and heterodimerization activities(1,25). Therefore, expression of the ESAT-6 protein was probably promoting the dimerization capacity of the N-terminal region of the truncated NS1 protein. This fact corresponds with previous observations that an insertion of heterologous dimerization domains can functionally replace the carboxy-terminal half of the NS1 protein, resulting in increased pathogenicity of recombinant influenza viruses",
