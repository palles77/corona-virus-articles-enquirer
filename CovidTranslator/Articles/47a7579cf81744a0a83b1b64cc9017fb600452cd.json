The main symptoms on admission were fever and dry cough. Most patients (91.4%) had mild or moderate illnesses. Age of 50 years or older, breathing problems, diarrhea, and longer time between the first medical visit and admission were associated with higher level of clinical severity. Surveillance-identified cases were much less likely to progress to severe illness.",

The risk of case importation in Shenzhen was therefore high, especially because the COVID-19 epidemic occurred around the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday season during which intra-city mobility of the migrant population was extremely high. Since the first case of COVID-19 in Shenzhen was confirmed on Jan 20, 2020, local authorities activated the highest level of emergency response to the disease. Although there have been several studies on the transmission, epidemiology and clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in Wuhan (3, 5, 6) , data from other epidemic areas are still lacking (7) . In particular, information and knowledge of COVID-19 from a migrant city with high population mobility like Shenzhen can inform effective prevention and control strategies in other similar settings.

Mild cases were those with virological confirmation but without an evidence of having pneumonia. Moderate cases were mild cases at the same time with a diagnosis of pneumonia. Severe was defined when one of the following criteria was met: dyspnea (respiratory frequency\u226530/minute); blood oxygen saturation \u226493%; PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300; and/or lung infiltrates >50% within 24-48 hours.",

The incubation period was estimated by using a previously described parametric accelerated failure time model (10). Patients with detailed information on the time of exposure, the date of illness onset, or the first time of presentation were included for this analysis. We fitted lognormal, gamma, and Weilbull distributions using Markov Chain Monto Carlo in a Bayesian framework (11). We estimated the serial interval by using the time difference of illness onset between the infector and infectee. Initial reproductive number was estimated by using the best fit model based on date of illness onset of the early (Jan 10-23) local exposed cases without relation to the imported cases and the estimated serial interval of COVID-19. Logistic regression models were applied to identify factors associated with the clinical severity of COVID-19. All statistical tests and analyses of the incubation period, serial interval, and initial reproductive number were performed in R software (R foundation for Statistical Computing).",

The proportion of severe or critical cases in Shenzhen (8.6%) was significantly lower than that reported by Guan et al. in patients across China (15.7%) (15). In our study, older age, breathing problems, and diarrhea were correlated to the clinical severity on admission. Other studies also suggested that these factors were associated with poorer outcomes in patients in Wuhan and elsewhere (5, 15) . Furthermore, the longer time from the first medical visit to hospital admission was associated with higher clinical severity on admission, while surveillance identification was associated with lower clinical severity. Thus the low proportion of severe or critical cases in our study might be explained by the large number of cases identified by surveillance and the short time interval from the first medical visit to hospital admission. Of note, 33 (83.3%) of the severe or critical cases were selfidentified, which might be due to delayed hospital admission. Through active surveillance efforts such as screening of high-risk populations, a large proportion of COVID-19 patients were identified at the early stage of their illness, thus decreasing the possibility of progression to a severe illness. The hospital fatality rate of COVID-19 in Shenzhen (0.7%) was much lower than 14% reported from Wuhan (16), and also lower than 1.4% reported in a countywide study (15). Since data on clinical outcomes were censored in our study, the hospital fatality rate may be underestimated.",

Regarding the source of infection, the cases were more likely to have Wuhan exposure if they had illness onset before the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday starting from Jan 24, while more cases had exposure in Shenzhen or elsewhere afterwards(Figure 2A). In addition, there were more cases who sought medical care after illness onset in the early phase, while cases were more likely to be identified by surveillance and to be reported from cluster events after Jan 20 (Figure 2B, 2C).Using detailed information on the time of exposure and illness onset from 92 patients, we estimated the median incubation time of SARS-CoV-2 infection to be 5.0 (IQR: 3.1-8.2)",

It was speculated that effective reproduction number might have decreased below one recently, given there were no more local cases after Feb 14. Of note, the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases in Shenzhen continued to drop in recent weeks although businesses had begun to resume since Feb 10.

A substantial proportion of the cases were surveillanceidentified with less severe illness. Although the intensive and comprehensive measures and interventions have effectively contained the epidemic in Shenzhen, there is still high risk of rebound of COVID-19 cases due to the return of migrants for work, reopening of schools, removal of restrictions of movements and gatherings, and potential importation of cases from other countries. Close monitoring and risk assessments are still imperative for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in the future.",
