The aim of this study is to determine whether there is any difference in selected cytokine or chemokines response in asthmatic children compared to non-asthmatic children during acute M. pneumoniae pneumonia. Methods: Seventy-five children, 6-12 years of age, admitted with M. pneumoniae pneumonia were enrolled. Two patient groups were defined: the children with known asthma (N = 40) and non-asthmatic children (N = 35). Interleukin (IL)-18 and selected chemokines, IL-8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and regulation upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were measured by means of ELISA in the plasma samples of the patients collected on admission. We investigated the values of these mediators in relation to the asthma status and symptom severity of the patients. Twenty age-matched, non-infected controls were also studied. Results: Plasma levels of IL-18 and the chemokines increased significantly in the patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia compared to non-infected, age-matched controls (P < 0.01). However, the asthmatic patients showed significantly reduced IL-18 and CXCL10 responses (P < 0.01, <0.05, respectively) and had more severe pneumonia symptoms (P < 0.01) compared to non-asthmatic patients. IL-18 was significantly lower in severe pneumonia group than in non-severe group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our study suggests that IL-18 and the chemokines are importantly involved in the pathogenesis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia. It also indicates that some asthmatic children have deficient IL-18 response when affected by M. pneumoniae pneumonia, which might be associated with more severe pneumonia observed in this group of patients.",

Interferoninducible protein (CXCL10/IP-10) and monokine-induced by c-interferon (CXCL9/MIG) are chemokines known to selectively attract Th1 cells [8, 9] . IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils and regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) is known to recruit eosinophils [8, 9] .

Our results show that these mediators are involved in the pathogenesis of this acute respiratory infection.

When the asthma group was divided according to the atopic status of the patients, CXCL10 was significantly lower and IL-18 showed a tendency toward lower levels in atopic asthma compared to non-atopic asthma. Our finding seems to be consistent with the previous studies that reported significantly decreased serum concentrations of IL-18 [21, 22] and CXCL10 [23] in the patients with asthma or allergic rhinitis. When the patients were divided according to the severity of pneumonia, IL-18 response was significantly decreased in the severe pneumonia group compared to the non-severe group.

Data are presented as medians (interquartile range). observed regardless of asthma status of the patients, which reached statistical significance only within asthma group. A recent study has demonstrated that asthmatic children have deficient cellular and humoral immune responses to respiratory infection with M. pneumoniae and may suffer prolonged or persistent infection [3] . In our study, asthma group presented significantly higher symptom score than non-asthma group, despite the fact that the number of subjects showing severe symptom was not different between the two patient groups. Together with the previous studies, our results suggest that some asthmatic children are more likely to experience severe symptoms when affected by M. pneumoniae pneumonia, which might be associated with deficient early IL-18 response.",

The inconsistency between those results and ours may be partially explained by different age distribution and clinical characteristics of the enrolled subjects and different criteria for severe group between the two studies. Different functions of proinflammatory cytokines in experimental pneumonia caused by different respiratory pathogens have been demonstrated. Contrary to the studies showing a protective role of IL-18 during S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae pneumonia stated above [19, 20] , IL-18 was reported to impair the pulmonary host defense against Pseudomonas aeruginosa [25] . It was suggested that role of an individual cytokine such as IL-18 may be determined by the underlying state of host and the character of infecting agent [20] . Taken together with those previous studies, our findings suggest that further studies seem to be needed to find out whether the asthma-or severity-related difference in IL-18 response is specific for M. pneumoniae pneumonia in children.",
