We use simple mathematical models to describe this process with the aim to better understand the emergence of an epidemic resulting from such a mutation and the extent of measures that are needed to control it. The feared outbreak of a human-human transmissible form of avian influenza leading to a global epidemic is the paradigm for this study. We extend the SIR approach to derive a deterministic and a stochastic formulation to describe the evolution of two classes of susceptible and infected states and a removed state, leading to a system of ordinary differential equations and a stochastic equivalent based on a Markov process. For the deterministic model, the contrasting timescale of the mutation process and disease infectiousness is exploited in two limits using asymptotic analysis in order to determine, in terms of the model parameters, necessary conditions for an epidemic to take place and timescales for the onset of the epidemic, the size and duration of the epidemic and the maximum level of the infected individuals at one time. Furthermore, the basic reproduction number R 0 is determined from asymptotic analysis of a distinguished limit. Comparisons between the deterministic and stochastic model demonstrate that stochasticity has little effect on most aspects of an epidemic, but does have significant impact on its onset particularly for smaller populations and lower mutation rates for representatively large populations. The deterministic model is extended to investigate a range of quarantine and vaccination programmes, whereby in the two asymptotic limits analysed, quantitative estimates on the outcomes and effectiveness of these control measures are established.",

Human cases have resulted from direct or close contact with infected poultry (domesticated chickens, ducks and turkeys). The spread of avian influenza from an infected person to another has rarely been reported and the transmission has not been observed to continue beyond one person. All influenza viruses, however, have the ability to change and adapt. Past examples, such as the Spanish flu, have shown that this could result with a transmissible virus which can spread easily and directly to humans. Such an outbreak could develop into an epidemic on a global scale, potentially taking millions of lives. A better understanding of the dynamics of how events leading to an epidemic can help to control and eradicate the disease and to prevent an infectious disease from developing into an epidemic.",

Minor mutations may involve small changes to surface glycoproteins, resulting with a strain of the same viral subtype that can deceive the adaptive immune response, and reinfect a previously infected host. This kind of mutation is known as antigenic drift and leads to recurrent, often https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2018.08.002 0040-5809/\u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. annual, outbreaks of an influenza subtype. More dramatic mutations leading to new viral subtypes are known as antigenic shifts, which can arise in at least two ways. The first way is known as reassortment in which influenza viruses of two different subtypes infect the same host simultaneously, whereby genetic material could be exchanged to form a new, viable virus. This is a feared possibility regarding individuals infected by both the human and avian forms of influenza, leading to a transmissible form of the disease. The second involves direct or indirect introduction of an avian influenza virus into humans which subsequently adapt to the new host (Scholtissek, 1994; Ferguson et al., 2003) . The new virus subtype, with no antibodies against it present in the human body, will transmit easily from human to human, as a result, a global pandemic may occur.",

            "text": "Published models of avian flu have focused on the spread of disease between bird populations and farms (Boender et al., 2007; Le Menach et al., 2006; Sharke et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2012) and cross-species transmission between bird and human populations (Chong et al., 2014; Gumel, 2009; Iwami et al., 2007; Martcheva, 2014) . In each of these studies their aim is to understand the dynamics of the disease and the effectiveness of measures to control in both bird and human populations. Each of the bird-human transmission models is extension of the ''standard'' SIR compartmental formulation (Susceptibles-Infectives-Removed) for an endemic disease (i.e. natural birth and death processes are considered), whereby mutation to the human-human transmissible form emerges via antigenic shift in human hosts. The mutation events are assumed to have occurred either at a fixed rate (Chong et al., 2014; Gumel, 2009; Iwami et al., 2007) or as a spontaneous event at a given time point (Martcheva, 2014) . The core of the analysis investigates the stability of equilibria and establishing the basic reproduction numbers of the disease in the populations. In contrast to these studies, we analyse in this paper a model that describes the potential development of an epidemic of human-human transmission form of flu by focusing on the human population only, whereby bird-human transmission only occurs to a sub-population of humans (bird handlers) at a fixed rate (assuming an approximately fixed population of diseased birds). In common with the above mentioned avian flu models, we extend the SIR formulation and assume mutation is via antigenic shift in humans, however, we analyse in much more detail the transient behaviour (e.g. timescales for epidemic outbreak, duration of epidemic) as well as the long-time dynamics. Moreover, a stochastic version of the model is investigated to assess the reliability of the predictions from a continuum model in a range of circumstances. We note that modelling epidemics using SIR based models has had a long history since the seminal work of Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) , including applications to influenza, sexually transmitted disease, the ''Bombay plague'' (Murray, 1993) and West Nile virus (Wonham et al., 2004) . Amongst the mathematical extensions include more general infection rate kinetics (Korobeinikov and Maini, 2004) , terms with time delays (Jin and Ma, 2006; Tchuenche et al., 2007; Cooke, 1979) , stochasticity (Tornatore et al., 2005; Tuckwell and Williams, 2007) and spatial spread (K\u00e4ll\u00e9n et al., 1985) . We also note there are a number of epidemic models examining mutations and genetic drift (e.g. Boni et al., 2006; Girvan et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2003; Pease, 1987) , many of which are more sophisticated than the proposed model, but at a cost at being more difficult to analyse.",

Whilst the former model is expected to be mainly applicable to large populations, the slow mutation process suggests that stochasticity is important, particularly early in an epidemic. We analyse these models to determine the effects of parameters on a number of features of an epidemic (onset time, epidemic duration etc.), establishing the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches. Furthermore, the deterministic model is extended to investigate potential measures in disease control. Though the model provides a general framework for in-host mutation more virulent forms of disease, we use the much feared avian flu scenario as a paradigm.",

We carry out large-time (Section 3) and asymptotic (Section 4) analysis to obtain predictions, in terms of reduced model solutions, on the possible development of an epidemic.

The entire population is broadly compartmentalised into susceptible, infective and recovered (or removed) classes and the populations vary continuously in time. In the case of avian flu, only a fraction of a population are exposed to birds who are themselves exposed to the bird-bird transmissible form of avian flu. We thus split the susceptible class into two, one class that are bird-handlers (mainly poultry farmers) at risk of catching flu directly from their birds and the other class who are not exposed to potentially diseased birds. We note, that this assumption has general application, for example, where sub-populations have different exposure to a non-human-human transmissible disease based on their activity or their geographical location. We will not be modelling bird populations explicitly and assume that their numbers are constant. Those infected by the bird-human transmissible form of avian flu are not able to infect other susceptibles, unless the virus has mutated to a humanhuman transmissible form, thus two infected classes are assumed. To summarise, the total population is divided into five subclasses: S b : population of the bird-handlers at risk of catching avian flu from birds. S n : population of individuals not at risk of catching avian flu from birds. I b : population of infectives with only the non-mutated birdhuman transmissible avian flu. with S, I and R conventionally denote the susceptible, infective and removed/recovered. The variable R is the population who has survived or died from the disease; taking the mortality fraction to be \u03b7, then \u03b7R is the number of deaths from the disease (currently \u03b7 \u2248 0.53 World Health Organization, 2015-2018). We note that we have assumed that recovery from one form of the flu leads to immunity against both forms. The pathway summarising the interaction between the population classes is illustrated in Fig. 1 , and a summary of the modelling assumptions is as follows,",

We observe that there is an initial time period (t < T L ), in which when \u00b5 = 10 \u22124 the majority of the population is unaffected by the disease, whereas for \u00b5 = 1 the susceptible bird-handlers, S b , are steadily acquiring the bird-human transmissible form of the disease. At around the time indicated by the vertical line (t = T L ), the epidemic of the mutated transmissible form begins affecting the whole population. One of the interesting features in these simulations is this apparent time lag before the onset of the epidemic, moreover the occurrence of the bird-human transmissible form appears to be negligible during the epidemic. We note increasing \u03b5 moves the t = T L line to the left, whereby for \u03b5 = O(1) there is no delay in the emergence of the mutated flu epidemic. We investigated the model in two biologically relevant cases using singular perturbation theory, namely (1) \u03b5 \u2192 0 and \u00b5 \u2192 0 and (2) \u03b5 \u2192 0 and \u00b5 = O(1). Since case (1) is most relevant for avian flu, whereby the rates of bird-human disease transmission and mutation are very low, we present the analysis in some detail in Section 4.1, whilst that for case (2) is briefly summarised in Section 4.2. The method used provides a systematic process by which the solutions of the model are separated as a sequence of timescales, within which the dominant processes are identified and represented by reduced versions of the equations.

These phases will be made explicit by the analysis below. The first phase involves the equilibration in population of those infected by the bird-human transmissible form of avian flu over an t = O(1) timescale.

This restriction states that the timescale for a mutation event (1/\u03b5) is much less than the exponential of the timescale for cross-species transmission (e 1/\u00b5 ) and arises from the time at which the solutions of the first timescale breakdown (see Section 4.1.1). The analysis for the case ln(1/\u03b5) \u226b 1/\u00b5 follows that of the \u03b5 \u2192 0 and \u00b5 = O(1) limit summarised in Section 4.2 and the distinguishing features of these two limiting cases merge when ln(1/\u03b5) \u223c 1/\u00b5 (analysed in Appendix A to determine an expression for R 0 ).

Similar investigations based on the standard SIR model would predict that \u03bd needs to be O(1) in order to be effective; this could be a significant over-estimate, which may compromise the application of this vaccination approach in managing the disease. We note that there is no change to R 0 in this analysis. Fig. 7(a) shows the recovered/removed fraction R against time to demonstrate how the vaccination rate \u03bd effects the total proportion of the population that had caught the disease. Here, the relevant case corresponds to \u03b5, \u00b5 \u226a 1, and the values used are \u03bd = X (\u03b2\u22121)/ln(1/\u03b5\u00b5) = X /T L for X = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.6. The figure suggests that even at X = 0.5 (or \u03bd = 1/2T L ) the vaccination programme significantly reduces the size of the epidemic. The effect of the vaccination rate X on the fraction of the population that catches the disease, R \u221e , is shown in Fig. 7(b) . The analysis predicts that the vaccination programme will be effective when (1), and the numerical results support this. Interestingly, as the infection rate \u03b2 increases, the removed fraction R \u221e decreases slightly beyond X \u2248 0.6. The general pattern of the profiles shifting to the right on increasing \u03b2 ends at about \u03b2 = 20, as \u03b2 increases further (unlikely to be relevant in biological terms) the profiles retreat to the left due to the increased effects of the vaccination rate (as \u03bd \u221d \u03b2 for fixed X ) outpacing that of the rate of infection.",

For instance, if the rate of catching bird flu and the mutation rate to the transmissible form are both very small, then the population of I b will be small and individuals with bird flu will most likely be recovered/removed before a mutation event occurs. In such circumstances, a deterministic model may not capture the early stages well and we hence investigate in this section a stochastic form of the model proposed in Section 2. In particular, we will investigate how stochasticity effects features of an epidemic such as the maximum number of individuals infected with the transmissible form, total number of those recovered or removed and the timescales for the onset of the epidemic and its duration. The proposed stochastic model will take the form of a continuous time Markov process, whereby future states are only dependent on the present one. Using the same variable names as before, the four state variables are S n (t), S b (t), I b (t) and I m (t), the variable R(t) being derived from (2.6).

The latter observation is further demonstrated in Fig. 9 .

Furthermore, the table shows that total number of individuals in the recovered/removed class as t \u2192 \u221e is in very good agreement. We note that the standard deviations of the stochastic model are less than 1% of the mean in the first three quantities listed. However, where the deterministic model is a poor predictor of stochastic solutions is with regard to the onset of the epidemic, where for smaller values of N, \u03b5 and \u00b5 it is a severe under-estimate. For this reason, we analyse the stochastic model further to determine analytical estimates for the epidemic onset time in Section 6.2. We investigated the distribution of onset times T L for a number of values for N, \u03b5 and \u00b5; two examples of which are presented in Fig. 11 , where the probability density functions for T L are approximated from 10 000 realisations in each case. Here, the onset times is split into equal time intervals (or bins) and the frequency of elements from the raw data lying in each bin is normalised so that there is unit area under the curve; the time points in the plot are the mid values in the bins. For larger \u03b5 and \u00b5, the shape of the distribution is near bell-shaped, which broadens and skews to the left as \u03b5 and \u00b5 gets smaller. For the case of \u03b5 = \u00b5 = 10 \u22123 ( fig. (a) ), the profile happens to fit very well to that of the Gumbel distribution (here, the distribution's two parameters are formulated using the mean and standard deviation of the data). However, on comparing all of the probability distributions available in the mathematics package MATLAB with all of the results generated from the stochastic simulations, no single distribution fits the data well in all cases (indeed all these distributions poorly fitted that shown in the right plot); hence this was not pursued further. Fig. 11(b) shows the case \u03b5 = \u00b5 = 10 \u22124 , where, interestingly, the modal value of T L \u2248 10 in the plot is much closer to that predicted by the deterministic model.",

            "text": "In this paper, a simple mathematical model is constructed to study the outbreak of an infectious disease following mutation of a non-transmissible strain for which only a subset of the population are at risk of catching. This scenario may arise in avian flu, in which currently only people working with poultry are likely to catch the disease, but a mutation could lead to a human-human spreading strain, with potentially devastating results. We derived a mathematical model extending an SIR type approach that divides each of the susceptible and infectious classes into two subclasses. The susceptibles were divided into those who are (e.g. poultry farmers) or are not at risk of catching bird-human strain and those who are infected with the bird-human and human-human transmissible strains. We note, the assumed division of susceptibles into two (or more) classes has very wide application, where sub-populations with distinct disease exposure characteristics to the non-mutated form could be based on activity, geography or demography. The model has relatively few parameters and four dimensionless ones (\u03b2, \u00b5, \u03f5 and s 0 ), of these s 0 could be obtainable using suitable census data and using ordinary flu for the infection rates we may expect \u03b2 to be in the range 2 \u2212 5 (Chowell et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2003) . Estimation of \u00b5 and \u03f5 will be more difficult and will require clinical data and perhaps laboratory data for estimates of mutation rates. Analysis of the model was aimed at predicting the severity of an epidemic in terms of the model's parameter values. In particular, we sought to establish the necessary conditions for an epidemic to occur and key characteristics such as the timescale for the onset of the epidemic, the size and duration of the epidemic and the maximum level of the infected individuals at one time. For general parameter values, we derived in Section 3 bounds on the predicted total fraction of the population who will catch the disease. Further progress was made in two biologically feasible asymptotic limits in Section 4 using singular perturbation theory. Here, analytical approximations to the model solutions were made by solving systematically deduced reduced systems for different timescales, making it easier to identify the important processes at various stages of the epidemic and to express key epidemic features in terms of simple formulae (as summarised in Table 1 ). In particular, it was demonstrated that the naive assertion of the reproduction number R 0 = \u03b2 (dimensionless) would not be appropriate for small \u03b5 and \u00b5 \u223c 1/ln(1/\u03b5) or larger (Eq. (4.21) ). Furthermore, the analysis highlighted the role of parameters \u03b5 and \u00b5 on the logarithmic dependence on the timescale for epidemic onset, T L , whilst other aspects of an epidemic (duration, maximum infectives etc.) are largely governed by an SIR model and parameters \u03b2 and s 0 . However, it is in the prediction of T L , for very small \u03b5 and \u00b5 and insufficiently large populations, where the deterministic model fails, as demonstrated in Section 6 using a stochastic model; the rarity of mutation events combined with failure to pass on the infection result in extended onset times. This highlights the need for caution when using a deterministic model to describe the progress of a disease in ''large populations'', as the presence of small parameters may necessitate the population to be much larger than expected (perhaps beyond that which is applicable) for the model to represent well the mean of a stochastic process. However, in all other key features of an epidemic, the results of the deterministic and stochastic models were in very good agreement.",

The simple formulations resulting from asymptotic analysis made it a relatively simple task to predict the outcome of such measures and, in particular, indicate how intensively the measures need to be applied in order for them to be effective. They target two characteristics of the disease predicted by the model: (1) by reducing the effective basic reproduction number (specifically in the cases of quarantine and pre-infection vaccination programmes) and (2) by exploiting the time lag prior to the epidemic, whereby a significant proportion of the population will be vaccinated before the outbreak. Of course, the situation is more complicated than that assumed in the model, with the existence of many and newly evolving flu virus strains and the constant need to develop new vaccines. Without suitable estimates of all the parameters, it is difficult to assert which programme will be the most effective.

Of course, such modelling simplifications are made at a cost of a number of potentially important details. The model can be refined to consider other phases (e.g. incubation phase), population classes (e.g. bird populations), endemic scenario (population growth and migration), time dependent infectiousness and recovery (e.g. integro-and/or delay-differential equation systems), and spatial effects (either as a continuum or in a patch network). These refinements will doubtless lead to models with better predictive capabilities in more specific scenarios. Nevertheless, the current model serves as a simple approximation to describe the emergence of mutated, spreadable disease, that is simple enough to analyse in some detail and so provide insight into the timing and appropriate use of control measures should the threat of an epidemic becomes imminent; for avian flu, we hope this will never be the case.",

Consequently, there will be an error of size O(ln(ln(1/\u03b5)))/ln(1/\u03b5) \u226a 1 to the formula in R 0 . As this error is small, (A.14) is applicable as a leading order estimate for the full definition of R 0 in this paper. The remaining analysis for this case is similar to that described in Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 and is not discussed further.",

In the latter case, having 1 \u226a T L \u223c ln(1/\u03b5)/(\u03b2s 0 \u2212 1) ensures that S b , I b \u223c 0 before I m \u223c \u03c3 , so the susceptible pool is only those in population S n ; if \u03b2 \u223c ln(1/\u03b5) or larger then setting s 0 = 1 gives a good approximation. The system (B.1)-(B.3) is the classic SIR model and it does seem likely that the analysis below has been reported before in some form; however, we have not found any such reference and hence its inclusion here. We note the problem to determine the epidemic duration is a shooting problem, in which we impose the boundary condition I m (T \u03c3 ) = \u03c3 to determine T \u03c3 ; this could be routinely solved numerically. However, for there to be a solution T \u03c3 > 0, dI m /dt must be positive at t = 0, hence \u03b2 > 1/(s 0 \u2212 \u03c3 ); this is the condition on \u03b2 for the epidemic to reach the level I m = \u03c3 . In the limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e there are three timescales of interest, namely t = O(1/\u03b2), t = ln(\u03b2)/\u03b2s 0 + O(1/\u03b2) and t = O(1), the latter timescale leading to the approximate value of T \u03c3 .",

Let p u = \u00b5(1 \u2212 s 0 )N\u03b4t be the probability of getting bird flu and p d = \u03b3 i \u03b4t be the probability of recovery, then the expected number of steps to I b = I c b satisfies the recurrence relation Fig. 13 . We note that the probability of mutation has been assumed negligible since \u03b5 \u226a \u03b3 . The recurrence relation can be solved analytically, in which E b 0 can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions and a sum of Gamma functions, however, (C.1) can be more easily computed by writing. . , I \u2212 1, leading to two recurrence relationssubject to z 0 = \u22121/p u and E b I = 0.
