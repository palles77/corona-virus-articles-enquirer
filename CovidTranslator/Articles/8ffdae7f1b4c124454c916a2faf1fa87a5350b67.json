Methods: Throat swabs from patients with an ILI presenting to physicians in sentinel practices were collected during the 2016-2017 influenza season. Results: A total of 52 samples tested positive by FilmArray Respiratory Panel. Forty percent were influenza A virus, and subtype H3N2 virus was the major epidemic strain. However, nearly 60% of ILI cases seen at sentinel sites were caused by non-influenza pathogens. The results of the FilmArray assay and cell culture were identical, and this assay was more sensitive than a rapid influenza diagnostic test. Genetic analyses revealed new influenza A H3N2 variants belonging to a novel subclade 3C.2a2. Conclusions: The FilmArray assay facilitates urgent testing and laboratory surveillance for common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. This study demonstrated the use of a highly sensitive assay using clinical samples that is feasible for application worldwide. This may lead to an increased rate of diagnosis of viral infections and to improved patient outcomes, and in particular to a reduction in the overuse of antibiotics and antivirals.",

During past influenza seasons, many severe cases and deaths were reported among the middle-aged population group, which had a major socioeconomic impact. Therefore, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) expanded their scope to provide free influenza vaccinations for children aged 6 months to <18 years, pregnant women, women within 6 months of giving birth, adults aged >50 years, at-risk individuals with chronic medical conditions, individuals with rare diseases or major illnesses/injury, health care and public health personnel, poultry farmers and animal health inspectors, individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 , and residents and personnel at nursing institutes. This campaign increased the flu vaccination coverage from 13% to 25% of the total population of Taiwan.",

Influenza surveillance in Taiwan is based on sentinel physician and laboratory isolation of influenza viruses (Lin et al., 2008) . However, other respiratory viruses cause upper respiratory tract infections at rates similar to those of influenza A virus and account for a substantial percentage of all ILI cases (Fowlkes et al., 2014; Otomaru et al., 2015) . Data from this study showed that around 60% of ILI cases seen at sentinel sites were not caused by influenza virus infections. Even during the influenza season there are still many other respiratory pathogens, not only viruses but also bacteria, that co-circulate with influenza virus. Of note, HRV/ HEV most part of the non-influenza infections in Taiwan, and data from further laboratory investigations showed that 11 (84.6%) of these cases were caused by enteroviruses CA2, CA6, and CA10. The rate of positivity for HRV/HEV infection in the present study is higher than that reported in previous studies (Liao et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2004) .",

In this study, the concurrent existence of European strains in the 3C.2a2 subclade was identified (Harvala et al., 2017) , and this genetic observation showed that epidemic strains of the same serotype isolated in Taiwan were comparable to strains isolated elsewhere; however, the origin and effects of strains introduced from outside Taiwan could not be addressed in this study. It remains unclear why Taiwan is an important region for viral diversity. However, the geographical position of Taiwan provides an ideal environment for viral migration between tropical and temperate regions. Furthermore, among the countries of East Asia, Taiwan is particularly highly interconnected with the world via air travel. Thus the continuous monitoring of Taiwanese isolates may provide a complete profile of viral antigenic and genetic evolution patterns that may be important to assist in the early prediction of potential new regional or pandemic strains.",

            "text": "This study has some limitations. First, the surveillance was implemented at three sentinel sites and surrounding areas in Taipei City, which may limit the ability to generalize the findings to the entire country. Second, in the case of negative results for any of the tested pathogens, no further tests were performed to identify other etiological agents including bacteria. Third, it is possible that these observations were limited by the particular strains of respiratory viruses circulating in the study region. Larger studies involving specimens from different geographical areas would be helpful to assess the reliability and validity of the study findings. The facilities available for the rapid diagnosis of these microorganisms in our laboratory include an automated NucliSens easyMAG instrument (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) for nucleic acid extraction, a LightCycler thermal cycler (Roche, Molecular Biochemical) for real-time PCR detection, and a Perkin Elmer 2700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Forest City, CA, USA) for conventional RT-PCR reactions. The total runtime is approximately 6.5 h and the cost of testing eight specimens for all 20 respiratory pathogens is about USD 623.80, including reagents and supplies. Assuming the use of a single FilmArray instrument for diagnosis, it takes about 8.5 h to test eight specimens. The list price for eight FilmArray Respiratory Panel kits is USD 1032.00 (USD 129.00/test), and no other reagents or supplies are needed. Thus, the cost of the FilmArray assay is higher than that of the previously used conventional methods for respiratory pathogen testing. However, the FilmArray Respiratory Panel offers significant advantages such as accuracy, ease of use, faster turnaround time, and less hands-on time, and this test may be more favorable than other available methods.",

The FilmArray system has the ability to perform high-order multiplex testing yet is simple to use and requires minimal hands-on time. Previous studies have shown the rapid evolution of Taiwanese influenza isolates in terms of antigenic and genetic diversity, which may result in epidemic strains that have the capacity to become the dominant strains worldwide (Chiu et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2007) . Of note, the data from this study show that the FilmArray system was able to detect new genetic variants of the influenza A H3N2 virus even in the small number of samples tested. Thus, the system could be used as the first-line diagnostic test for the sensitive and accurate detection of known respiratory pathogens. Figure 1 . Molecular phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood method. The evolutionary history was inferred using the maximum likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model. Numbers to the left of the nodes are bootstrap percentages (1000 replications). Bootstrap values of less than 70 are not shown. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying the Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the maximum composite likelihood (MCL) approach, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA 6.",
