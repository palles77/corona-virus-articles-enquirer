To gain a glimpse into the biological potential of 2, it was subjected to antiviral analysis versus herpes simplex-1, herpes simplex-2, herpes simplex-1 (TK \u2212 ), vaccinia, cowpox, vesicular stomatitis, coxsackie B4, respiratory syncytial, parainfluenza 3, reovirus-1, Sinbis, Punta Toro, rhinovirus, adenovirus, hepatitis C, and West Nile, and feline coronavirus. 11 No activity was found for these viruses. However, effects towards measles (MO6) were observed (EC 50 2.8 \u03bcM, neutral red assay; EC 50 13 \u03bcM, visual assay). As a member of the paramyxoviridae family of viruses it might be expected that some activity would be seen with an aristeromycin analog since this viral family is susceptible to inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteine metabolism. 12 It is surprising, however, that the other paramyxo representatives (respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza) and none of the other viruses (for example, vaccinia, cowpox, vesicular stomatitis, and reo) that are vulnerable to such interference were not effected by 2. 12 Perhaps, another mechanism is selectively operative for 2 towards measles. 13 No cytotoxicity arose in the cell lines used for the antiviral assays. 14 Scheme 1.
