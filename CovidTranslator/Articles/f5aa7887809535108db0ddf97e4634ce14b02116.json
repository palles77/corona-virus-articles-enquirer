Exosomes contain diverse types of proteins, mRNA and miRNA. This figure shows the exosomal content of exosomes derived from MC9 mouse cells [2] . The exocarta compendium was queried for this exosome study with protein, mRNA and miRNA content recorded from the same samples. Considering the very large number of entities, we considered only those proteins and RNA that are part of the top physiological functional groups. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to cluster the proteins by molecular category, subcellular localization and functional group. In the diagram, the top right panel (a) indicates the subcellular localization of exosomal proteins and the mRNAs (as representatives of proteins they may encode if all the mRNAs are functional and get translated). The symbol and legend are indicated on the figure. The top 10 functional clusters of proteins (b), miRNA (c) and mRNA (c) are graphically depicted. These data represent the top 10 hits from Ingenuity generated canonical pathway analysis for functional protein clusters. According to recent reports exosomes also contain mitochondrial DNA and oncogenic/amplified DNA. microvesicles help maturing erythrocytes get rid of transferrin receptors and other obsolete proteins [6] . Visualization by electron microscopy and correlation of the vesicle release kinetics with the well established endocytosis kinetics of markers such as the transferrin receptor (TfR), revealed that a subset of endosomal vesicles are released intact to the cell exterior in a mechanism distinct from endocytic recycling [6] .",

            "text": "While cells of the hematopoietic lineage such as B-cells, dendritic cells, mast cells, T-cells and platelets were initially characterized for exosome production, in later years non-hematopoietic cells such as various epithelial cell types, neurons, and a very wide variety of tumor cells have also been shown to produce exosomes [9] . Of particular interest are tumor cells that exhibit enhanced production of exosomes. The mechanism or need for such enhanced production of exosomes is not understood but may indicate a role for exosomes in tumor development [10] . Since exosome production is a continuous cell function, certain cell types like platelets can be treated with agonists to induce degranulation and enhanced release of microvesicles and exosomes [11] . Exosome secretion is also increased on free radical stress or UV irradiation, decreased membrane cholesterol, and increased intracellular calcium. In vivo, exosomes have been characterized in most circulating body fluids such as plasma, urine, saliva, broncheoalveolar lavage (BAL), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and others [12, 13] . The biogenesis and molecular relevance of exosomes. (a) Exosomes arise from the cell 0 s endosomal system. The plasma membrane invaginates and buds off during endocytic internalization. Cargo destined for lysosomal degradation is ubiquitinated. At the early endosome the decision to recycle or be directed to the late endosome relies on specific protein interactions and domain based sorting. The early endosome matures into a late endosomal compartment where inward budding of intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) allows the capture of cytoplasmic cargo. Distinct subsets of ILVs may target cargo for lysosomal degradation (ESCRT dependent, ceramide independent) or release cargo to the cell 0 s exterior via exosomes. The formation of exosomes is ceramide biosynthesis dependent and relatively ESCRT independent. Exosomes retain similar membrane topology as the plasma membrane due to the two membrane inversion events. Sorting of cargo into exosomes relies on specific interactions with lipids and proteins on membrane sub-domains as well as interactions with the tetraspanin web. (b) Exosomes are internalized by cells close to the donor or originating cell (juxtacrine uptake), some distance from the donor cell (paracrine uptake) or they may spread through systemic circulation and be taken up by distant tissues (endocrine uptake). There is specificity in exosome uptake as a function of recipient cell lineage. Exosome surface markers and host cell surface markers contribute to such selectivity in uptake. Exosomes may begin protein based signaling functions even as they adhere to the host cell. Uptake of exosomes occurs primarily through phago-lysosome intermediates or utilizing specific receptors for exosomal surface proteins or the Tim-4 receptor. Once internalized, exosomal content is released via the phagolysosome or localized in the late endosome. (c) The exosomal lipid, protein, RNA, miRNA and DNA content can alter a recipient cell 0 s molecular profile by various mechanisms which alter gene expression. Some possibilities for exosomal cargo mediated recipient cell reprogramming may include altered transcriptional or translational profile, transcript or protein modification, regulation of signaling cascades, protein localization and turnaround, key enzymatic reactions and cellular homeostasis. The source and condition of both the donor and recipient cell may determine which of these molecular mechanisms predominate. Intriguingly, exosomes may also have recipient cell type specific functions for the same molecule.

Additionally, the urinary exosome resource from the Knepper Lab at NIH also provides a detailed dataset of urine exosomal protein content (Urinary Exosome Protein Database). Augmenting this core set of components, the biology of exosomes originates from the cell type and cell condition specific cargo of protein, lipid, RNA, miRNA and DNA (Fig. 1 ). This dependence of biomolecular content on cell context, and variations between normal and diseased cells, has garnered much interest in exosomes as harbors of disease biomarkers which could be thought of as a ''fluidome'' or ''liquid biopsies'' where extraction of exosomes from body fluids can provide a snapshot into the donor cell condition [15] .

The mono ubiquitination of cargo and its sorting for lysosomal degradation in MVBs is a well-studied process. MVB topology serves as a sorting station where ubiquitinated cargo is directed to ILVs fated for degradation while membrane sequestration allows other proteins to be directed to the recycling compartment.",

Uptake of exosomes is possibly a non-random event and recent papers [18] suggest a mechanistic basis to target cell selection by invoking tetraspanins as entry selection markers. This is supported by a defined set of exosomeassociated tetraspanins that appear to direct targeting to endothelial cells to promote angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. It has also been shown by Valadi et al. [2] . that DC-derived exosomes are efficiently taken up only by DC lineage cells. In recent papers there is well documented evidence that exosomes can act systemically and behave as endocrine moieties in that respect [23] .

            "text": "Having discussed the various physiological and pathophysiological roles exosomes may play in different cell and tissue types, it is clear that many opportunities exist to harness exosome biology as either a therapeutic or treatment strategy. As an example, the capacity to differentially challenge DCs to produce dexosomes with either pro-or anti-inflammatory properties is finding exciting uses in the field of cancer vaccines, humoral immunity, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) vaccine and transplant tolerance induction, delayed type hypersensitive response, rheumatoid Fig. 3 . Exosomes can alter the molecular profile of their microenvironment and recipient cells and can affect tissue health. (a) Exosomes help to establish a metastatic niche to aid tumor growth and tumor metastasis. Utilizing VEGF and cytokine cargo, exosomes enhance recruitment of hematopoietic and endothelial precursor cells to enhance neoangiogenesis in the tumor. Exosomes have also been suggested to influence planar cell polarity and the extracellular matrix to allow tumor cell mobilization. To aid tumor growth, exosomes are additionally known to trigger apoptotic reduction in anti-tumor immune cells through FasL and TNF-pathways. The growth factor and cytokine cargo helps exosomes to attract disseminated tumor cells from the primary tumor site as well as cells of the myeloid and erythropoietic lineages to the pre-metastatic niche to aid tumor spread. (b) Exosomes share many characteristics with viruses in the molecular machinery of budding from the plasma membrane. Retroviruses like HIV utilize the cellencoded intercellular vesicle traffic as a means to protect themselves from the host cell's proteolytic system. Segregating into the exosomes during the exosome formation event, the virus is camouflaged and avoids the host surveillance system and proteolysis. The exosome encapsulated virus is furthermore able to disseminate and move between cells utilizing the exosome pathway for entering a host cell without utilizing its own fusion machinery as it searches for optimal target cells. Exosomes thus aid the trans-infection of viruses. (c) Amyloid plaques of the Alzheimer's disease afflicted brain have aggregates of amyloid beta peptide processed from amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is processed by at least three proteases termed a-, b-, and g-secretases, which lead to the generation of a number of proteolytic fragments, including Ab when APP is cleaved by band g-secretases. Exosomes have been found to contain APP, Ab and other proteolytic fragments of APP, a-, b-, and some components of g-secretase. It has also been suggested that exosomes from an unhealthy brain cell may cause spread of cellular insults in the form of RNA and protein to surrounding healthy cells and thus aid the spread of neurological disorders. EE, early endosome, AICD, amyloid precursor protein intracellular cytoplasmic/C-terminal domain. arthritis treatment, etc. [36] . Additional studies are ongoing to establish exosomes as nanocarriers for delivery of a variety of therapeutic modalities [23] . It is formally possible, although currently unlikely, that targeting exosome release could represent a viable therapeutic strategy. However, should future research demonstrate that exosomes are critical for certain pathological disease processes, a strategy of targeting the formation and/or release of exosomes in specific cell types (e.g. primary tumor cells, etc.) would represent a novel route of therapeutic intervention. Designing a strategy that is specific to the formation of exosomes in a single cell type rather than creating a general ''exosomal poison'' is likely to be both tantamount, and a tremendous challenge, to the development of such a drug. The specificity of exosomal disruption would be critical since it is unlikely that a general shutdown of exosome formation would be tolerated without adverse consequences. Achieving such specificity of destruction or modulation might be a challenge due to the non-redundant nature of most exosome formation regulators and the difficulty of identifying a molecule with the specificity required to target a cell-specific exosomal formation process in the body. However, we believe this approach can't be ruled out as a potential therapeutic strategy in the years to come. With innovative therapeutic modalities emerging today (bi-, tri-specific antibodies, etc.) and others on the horizon, such a pharmacological approach may become feasible should exosomes be conclusively implicated in disease in the future.",

Glioblastoma derived exosomes contain a diagnostic set of miRs in addition to mutant EGFR vIII [3] . Prostate cancer plasma exosomes revealed up-regulated miR-145 [64] . Circulating levels of miR-195 and let-7a decreased in cancer patients post-operatively suggesting feasibility as a prognosis biomarker as well. In this study, the level of certain miRs also correlated well with clinico-pathological variables like nodal status and estrogen receptor status. Significant changes to both proteins and miRNAs was also reported for circulating exosomes from patients suffering from ovarian cancers [72] . The study found that a set of 8 miRs could distinguish benign vs. malignant ovarian tumors. Peripheral blood exosomal miRs showed the same profile as the lung adenocarcinoma in stages I-IV patients [73] . The predictive capacity of exosomal miRNA was quite outstanding as exemplified by two exosomal miRNAs accurately discriminating acute lymphoid from acute myeloid leukemia.",

In terms of RNA content, the earliest reports of circulating RNA hypothesized that body fluid derived RNA must somehow be protected from the degradative RNAse-rich content of the body fluid. Many interesting theories have arisen over time to answer this conundrum such as the presence of a novel conformation that imparts resistance to nucleases, confinement in exosome-like vesicles and, recently, the presence of Argonaute bound and LDL bound RNA species in plasma. Other fascinating questions in the field of exosome biology include cargo sorting mechanisms, exosome uptake specificity, and the correlation between the mRNA, miRNA and protein content of exosomes in terms of selection for expulsion as well as in the landscape of effects on the recipient cell.",

            "text": "Fig. 2. The biogenesis and molecular relevance of exosomes. (a) Exosomes arise from the cell 0 s endosomal system. The plasma membrane invaginates and buds off during endocytic internalization. Cargo destined for lysosomal degradation is ubiquitinated. At the early endosome the decision to recycle or be directed to the late endosome relies on specific protein interactions and domain based sorting. The early endosome matures into a late endosomal compartment where inward budding of intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) allows the capture of cytoplasmic cargo. Distinct subsets of ILVs may target cargo for lysosomal degradation (ESCRT dependent, ceramide independent) or release cargo to the cell 0 s exterior via exosomes. The formation of exosomes is ceramide biosynthesis dependent and relatively ESCRT independent. Exosomes retain similar membrane topology as the plasma membrane due to the two membrane inversion events. Sorting of cargo into exosomes relies on specific interactions with lipids and proteins on membrane sub-domains as well as interactions with the tetraspanin web. (b) Exosomes are internalized by cells close to the donor or originating cell (juxtacrine uptake), some distance from the donor cell (paracrine uptake) or they may spread through systemic circulation and be taken up by distant tissues (endocrine uptake). There is specificity in exosome uptake as a function of recipient cell lineage. Exosome surface markers and host cell surface markers contribute to such selectivity in uptake. Exosomes may begin protein based signaling functions even as they adhere to the host cell. Uptake of exosomes occurs primarily through phago-lysosome intermediates or utilizing specific receptors for exosomal surface proteins or the Tim-4 receptor. Once internalized, exosomal content is released via the phagolysosome or localized in the late endosome. (c) The exosomal lipid, protein, RNA, miRNA and DNA content can alter a recipient cell 0 s molecular profile by various mechanisms which alter gene expression. Some possibilities for exosomal cargo mediated recipient cell reprogramming may include altered transcriptional or translational profile, transcript or protein modification, regulation of signaling cascades, protein localization and turnaround, key enzymatic reactions and cellular homeostasis. The source and condition of both the donor and recipient cell may determine which of these molecular mechanisms predominate. Intriguingly, exosomes may also have recipient cell type specific functions for the same molecule.
