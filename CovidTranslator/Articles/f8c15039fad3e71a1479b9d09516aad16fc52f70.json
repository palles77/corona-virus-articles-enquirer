In this study, we report clinical and microbiological features of ten COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Centro Hospitalar Conde de S\u00e3o Janu\u00e1rio (CHCSJ) between January 21 to February 16, 2020. Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT-PCR assay. In total, seven were imported cases and three were local cases. The median duration from Macau arrival to admission in imported cases was 3 days. Four patients required oxygen therapy but none of them needed machinal ventilation. No fatal cases were noted. The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%). In the \"Severe\" group, there was significantly more elderly patients (p=0.045), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (p=0.002), and elevated C-Reactive protein levels compared to the \"Mild to Moderate\" group (p<0.001). There were positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals in all patients' NPS and stool specimens but negative in all urine specimens. Based on our data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in stool and the possibility of a lag in viral detection in NPS specimens, the assessment of both fecal and respiratory specimen is recommended to enhance diagnostic sensitivity, and also to aid discharge decision before the role of viral RNA shedding in stool is clarified.",

The dynamic change and evolution in the laboratory data of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization were demonstrated ( Figure 2 ). Lymphopenia and elevated CRP and CK levels peaked in the second week after symptom onset, thus possibly indicating disease progression. After the third week of symptoms onset, we noted that white blood cells, such as neutrophils and lymphocytes, increased alongside the downtrend of CK, LDH, and CRP levels; this suggests a stable phase in the disease progression. Patients categorized as \"Severe\" had different laboratory features compared to those who were \"Mild to Moderate\" (Table 3 ). In the \"Severe\" group, there was significantly more elderly patients (p=0.045), higher LDH levels (p=0.002), and elevated CRP levels compared to the \"Mild to Moderate\" group (p<0.001).",

Suspected cytokine storms and a series of immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 have also been suggested [11] . Our data echoed the same findings of lymphopenia and elevated LDH levels during the second week after symptom onset. Major complications, including arrhythmias, shock, ARDS, and multiple organ failure were not present. Less than half of patients (40%) required low-flow oxygen therapy, and none of the patients needed invasive ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In this cohort, no patients were admitted to the ICU or died; 50% were discharged, and 50% remained hospitalized. For those who were discharged (n = 5), the median hospital stay was 20 days (IQR: [19] [20] [21] . We believe that early diagnosis and adequate supportive treatment may have positive effects on stabilizing the patients. Noticeably, the median duration from Macau arrival to admission was only 3 days, that early detection of imported cases may be contributed to the effective quarantine policy organized by the Macau government, and may minimize the spread of local outbreak in Macau as no new diagnosed cases from February 4 th to 27 th ,2020 [1] . after one negative and one inconclusive result from NPS specimens. All five NPS specimens taken six days after symptom onset remained negative or inconclusive by qRT-PCR in patient 5. In contrast, fecal samples were subsequently collected and virus RNA were detectable in 90% of our patients from their first sample by qRT-PCR. In addition, in patient 1, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in feces till 14 days after the onset of symptoms. This echoes the result from the first case in the U.S. that featured positive virus RNA in the stool [9] , but is in contrast to a case series reported by Chan et al [8] . A recent study has shown that cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II was also expressed in absorptive enterocytes in the ileum and colon [19] . Based on our data on viral shedding in stool and the possibility of a lag in viral detection in NPS specimens, it is not unreasonable to perform additional testing of both stool and respiratory specimens to enhance the detection sensitivity and minimize the \"escape\" of infected individuals. Although virus RNA shedding in feces was common in our patients, the question of whether it is a potential transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 deserves further evaluation since the viability of SAR-CoV-2 in feces is uncertain. Thus, we advocate that we should consider a combined assessment of both fecal and respiratory specimens for all patients during hospitalization. Furthermore, it is worth questioning the current discharge policy which is based on the clinical, radiological condition and twice negative results from qRT-PCR in respiratory specimens [5] . Our data suggested some patients may have the delay of virus RNA conversion in the stool sample. Patients with negative NPS and positive stool samples may be undergoing the convalescent phase and their infectivity during this phase remained unknown. We believed that the discharge of those patients should require additional considerations. For example, transferring those with low medical demands from hospital to another isolation facilities or extending the isolation period at home with strict infection control and follow-up may be considered before more data available against this transmission route, especially when healthcare resource is in scarcity during the outbreak. Notably, some recovered patients were reported to have virus RNA reappeared in respiratory samples after discharge [20] . We believed that false-negative RT-PCR test results, virus RNA residues or/and re-activation may be contributed to this phenomenon. Whether these patients are contagious or not, we should take a more cautious approach unless proven otherwise. Serial qRT-PCR tests and home isolation for discharged patients could provide a safety net to block the potential transmission. In our cohort, 70% of cases were imported that it was difficult to follow their conditions when they returned home in Mainland China, but they were advised to be followed in local medical institutions.",

Second, evaluation of viremia from patient's serum was not available in this study. Third, virus isolation from different specimens was not performed. Hence, it was impossible to determine whether RNA shedding in specimens correlated to the virus's viability. Finally, half of the enrolled patients are still hospitalized at the time of the submission of this paper. Therefore, there may have been bias regarding the prognosis of the patients.",

The primary findings in CT images of COVID-19 patients were as follow [7, 12] : ground glass opacities (GGO), inter-or intra-lobular septal thickening, and air space consolidation. Lung abnormalities on chest CT images were reported to show the greatest severity approximately 10 days after the initial onset of symptoms while consolidation could increase up to two weeks and be gradually absorbed [12] . Fibrous stripes were recognized upon improvement in the disease course [13] . These features were mostly in line with our cases (Figure 3) . Notably, a few slightly enlarged lymph nodes were found in the mediastinum in two of the 10 cases (patients 5 and 7), which the enlargement subsided in the fourth CT performed on day 21 after symptom onset in patient 5. Reactive lymphadenopathy due to infection might be one of the explanations.Currently, there is no medications for COVID-19 approved by FDA. Antiviral therapies such as ritonavir and lopinavir, with or without ribavirin, have shown some success in the treatment of SARS [14] , and an early report suggests that it might have similar efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 [15] .Meanwhile, phase III trials of remdesivir, ritonavir and lopinavir had been initiated [16] . In this cohort, all our patients received lopinavir/ritonavir. Although it is impossible to draw any conclusion of its efficacy before having the results from the trials, the side effects were well tolerated to all patients and the empirical use may be justified under the circumstances of epidemic. Although the use of corticosteroids is controversial [17] , three patients had received methylprednisolone for a short duration due to clinical and radiological exacerbations. We believe that this is still advisable for patients who have severe illness, based on the hypothesis of reducing cytokine storm and inflammation-mediated lung injury. The settlement of this debate still requires further high-quality studies to justify or against the use of corticosteroids, and also to determine the optimal timing, dosage and duration of administration.NPS remains a mainstay sampling method for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections; it is especially supported by recent data on SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in upper respiratory specimens with higher viral loads detected in the nasal area than in the throat [18] . Of our cases, 90% were diagnosed by RNA signals in NPS specimens. Interestingly, patient 5 was diagnosed via the detection of viral RNA in sputum",
