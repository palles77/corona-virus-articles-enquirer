In particular, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has quickly intensified interest in developing treatment options to mitigate impact on human life. Remdesivir (GS-5734\u2122) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is now being tested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in international, multi-site clinical trials. Currently available evidence about the antiviral effects of remdesivir against coronaviruses is primarily based on in vitro and in vivo studies (including some on a chemically related compound, GS-441524\u2122), which have demonstrated largely favorable findings. As the pandemic progresses, information from human compassionate use cases will continue to accumulate before the clinical trials are concluded. It is imperative for public health practitioners and the One Health community to stay up to date on the most promising potential therapeutic options that are under investigation. Thus, the purpose of this review is to synthesize the knowledge to date about remdesivir as a therapeutic option for coronaviruses, with a special focus on information relevant to the One Health community.

However, public perception and awareness of HCoVs has shifted considerably in the last twenty years, with the onset of three high profile outbreaks that have garnered international attention and have subsequently led to renewed interest in potential therapeutic options for HCoV-related illnesses. In 2002-2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infected more than 8,000 people, reaching 26 countries and resulting in a 10% case fatality rate [3] . In the ~7 years between April 2012 and November 2019, there were 2,494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that reached 27 countries and had a mortality rate of approximately 34% [4] , though serologic studies have implied that the prevalence of MERS-CoV may have been underestimated [5] . Most recently, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 in Wuhan and its subsequent spread to over 70 countries across the world has generated intense interest in vaccine development and treatment options for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [6, 7] .",

Originally developed to treat Ebola virus infection [8] , remdesivir is a prodrug of the parent adenosine analog, GS-441524 (Figure 1b) , both of which are metabolized into an active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) by the host (Figure 1c ) [13] . The parent nucleoside, GS-441524, has displayed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV, Marburg virus, and feline infectious peritonitis virus, among others [9, [14] [15] [16] .

            "text": "Viruses classified under the Coronaviridae family are enveloped positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that exhibit high genetic diversity [21] . Within the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, there are four genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus. Viruses in this family can infect a wide variety of host species, such as birds, humans, and non-human mammals, including dromedary camels, alpacas, domestic pigs, dogs, cats, ferrets, minks, and bats [5, 11, 12, 16, [22] [23] [24] . However, to our knowledge, only viruses of the alpha-and betacoronavirus genera infect humans [2] , though those in the gamma-and deltacoronavirus genera have indirect effects through economic impacts on the agricultural production of poultry and pigs [12] . Host specificity is believed to be largely dependent upon variation in the CoV spike attachment glycoprotein [23] . Although the infectivity of most strains is host species-specific, host range is wide across different CoVs, and some bat CoVs rely on the same host receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2; ACE-2) as human CoVs to facilitate entry into cells [11, 25, 26] . It has been hypothesized that the CoV propensity for host-switching may partly be attributable to recombination events that alter the spike protein, which, in turn, affects interactions with host receptors (e.g., ACE-2) [27, 28] .",

            "text": "As a nucleoside analog, remdesivir acts as an RdRp inhibitor, targeting the viral genome replication process. The RdRp is the protein complex CoVs use to replicate their RNA-based genomes. After the host metabolizes remdesivir into active NTP, the metabolite competes with adenosine triphosphate (ATP; the natural nucleotide normally used in this process) for incorporation into the nascent RNA strand [32] . The incorporation of this substitute into the new strand results in premature termination of RNA synthesis, halting the growth of the RNA strand after a few more nucleotides are added. Although CoVs have a proofreading process that is able to detect and remove other nucleoside analogs, rendering them resistant to many of these drugs, remdesivir seems to outpace this viral proofreading activity, thus maintaining antiviral activity [30] . Unsurprisingly, Agostini et al. reported that a mutant murine hepatitis virus (MHV) devoid of proofreading ability was more sensitive to remdesivir [13] . The opposite is also possible-that mutations that improve proofreading or otherwise increase fidelity of the base-pairing process may result in remdesivir resistance [33] . In fact, Agostini et al. also induced mutations in MHV (through passage in remdesivir) that conferred strong resistance against the drug, but these mutated strains were outcompeted by wild-type MHV in coinfected cell cultures that were not exposed to remdesivir [13] . How well this experiment would represent a situation in which a resistance mutation developed naturally, though, is unclear. Nonetheless, some evidence suggests that remdesivir could have an additional mechanism of action that has yet to be discovered, which, if true, may allow for partial antiviral activity to continue despite viral mutations that enhance replication fidelity [11] [12] [13] .",

This genetic diversity is posited to be attributable to the large viral genome and the molecular nuances of the viral RNA replication processes (e.g., RdRp infidelity) [21] . Although remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral, its efficacy against other families of viruses may not be generalizable to its effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2, and attempts to predict the level of potential generalizability are hampered by the possibility that the drug may have secondary mechanisms of action that are yet to be elucidated.

Among currently known CoVs, PDCoV has the least similar RdRp sequence compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (only 67-69% similarity in amino acid sequence) [12] . In fact, the RdRp of PDCoV has a different amino acid at a specific site (phenylalanine to leucine at residue 483), a dissimilarity that has been previously associated with increased resistance to remdesivir in other CoVs [12, 13] . Therefore, it was important to attempt to disentangle whether the lower antiviral activity observed could be related to a viral characteristic of PDCoV or if it could be attributable to differences in the cell lines used. While diminished potency of remdesivir against PDCoV was noted in cultures of porcine kidney epithelial cells (LLC-PK1), in a human liver cell line (Huh7), the EC 50 was relatively low (EC 50 not reached in LLC-PK1 vs. EC 50 =0.02 \u03bcM in Huh7; Table 1 ). Similarly, the EC 50 was substantially higher for antiviral activity against an endemic HCoV (229E) in the porcine cell line (3.8 \u03bcM compared to 0.02 \u03bcM in Huh7), again indicating the likely lower potency of the drug in this context. Thus, the observed variations in remdesivir potency against the same viruses in the different cell lines may imply that there is some factor associated with the cell line, rather than the virus, that may be affecting the drug's antiviral activity. In fact, the authors state that these findings may imply that LLC-PK1 cells lack a cellular process necessary for remdesivir antiviral activity, which could also support the hypothesis that remdesivir may have another mechanism of action that is not presently understood.",

For example, using a mouse model with a Ces1c-knockout (which better emulates human metabolism of remdesivir compared to wild-type mice) and a humanized MERS-CoV receptor, Sheahan et al. found that both prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir had protective effects against MERS-CoV replication and associated pathology, generally resulting in less lung damage and better pulmonary function compared to controls [10] . Interestingly, among mice that were infected with a higher virus quantity (i.e., more plaque-forming units), those receiving prophylactic remdesivir one day before infection had significantly better 6-day survival than infected control mice that did not receive remdesivir. However, the mice were sacrificed before longer follow-up data could be obtained. Similarly, in a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV pathogenesis, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of remdesivir demonstrated favorable results, reducing respiratory tract viral titers and pulmonary pathology [18] . Prophylactic use was initiated 24 hours prior to viral challenge, whereas therapeutic use was initiated 12 hours after challenge. While respiratory rate was not substantially different J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f between the prophylactic, therapeutic, and control groups, x-ray scores, representing the severity of pulmonary infiltrates, were significantly better in the prophylactic and therapeutic groups, comparing each to controls [18] . Incidentally, remdesivir has also been associated with beneficial effects, including reduced severity of respiratory signs and improved survival, against challenge with Nipah virus, which is a CoV-unrelated virus in the Paramyxoviridae family in African green monkeys [21] .",

Controls were not included, as historical data on untreated cats were available, demonstrating a mortality rate close to 100% [14, 36] . After experimental challenge with the FIP virus, 2 cats did not develop FIP-related signs and remained untreated [14] . In the 10 infected cats, treatment was initiated upon onset of FIP-associated clinical signs (~10-18 days post infection), and continued for 2 weeks. Of these cats, half (n=5) were treated with a 5mg/kg dose of GS-441524 administered subcutaneously once per day, and the other half (n=5) were treated with 2mg/kg daily. If disease recurred after initial treatment, cats were re-treated using the same regimen for another 2 weeks. Follow-up continued for 8 months. All treated cats demonstrated favorable responses to GS-441524 treatment within 24-48 hours, regardless of dose, and were still alive and clinically unremarkable 8 months post infection. Two cats (one from each dose group) experienced disease recurrence at 4 weeks and 6 weeks after initial treatment and were retreated. Adverse events related to treatment, other than temporary discomfort at the injection site, were not observed. This study was based on a small number of animals, and it is unclear whether experimental infection is a relevant representation of naturally-occurring FIPV infection in cats. Future studies with additional follow-up time would be helpful for assessing whether unexpected long-term sequelae are observed in the cats, since such information on surviving animals is sparse given the high fatality rate.",

Most cats in this study had \"wet\" or effusive FIP, the hallmark of which is the accumulation of fluids in the abdominal or thoracic cavities. There were only 3 cats in the study with abdominal noneffusive (\"dry\") FIP, which is a more chronic condition, and another 4 cats initially had dry FIP that progressed into wet FIP. One cat in the dry FIP group and one in the dry-to-wet group did not survive. Because of the small number of cats with dry FIP, conclusions cannot be drawn about whether remdesivir has greater efficacy in the treatment of some clinical manifestations of FIP than others. A strength of this study is that it was conducted among animals with naturallyoccurring CoV infection as a field trial, better representing real-world circumstances.",

Incidentally, randomization to remdesivir treatment was discontinued in this trial after an interim analysis showed superior survival for two other trial drugs, despite preclinical and compassionate use data having been favorable for remdesivir against the Ebola virus prior to the trial [9] . Interestingly, patients who received remdesivir had slower rates of viral clearance compared to patients who received single-dose antivirals (specifically, MAb114 and REGN-EB3), which the authors hypothesized may be related to the fact that the treatment plan for remdesivir involved multiple intravenous infusions. However, for now, information on the potential efficacy of remdesivir specifically against CoVs is largely limited to in vitro and animal studies, though COVID-19 related knowledge is evolving quickly.",

In addition to this issue, there are a number of factors that can impact how predictive findings from in vitro or in vivo models may be of clinical efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. For example, drugs that may be effective in vitro may not have clinical utility if the therapeutic dose induces severe adverse events in the patient. Alternatively, if the treatment dose does not attain an effective serum concentration in patients, or if EC 50 is greater than the achievable maximum serum concentration (C max ), then the drug is less likely to have therapeutic utility. With regard to animal models, how closely the model represents disease pathogenesis and drug metabolism in humans can be challenging to gauge.",

Another well-known candidate that is being evaluated in multiple trials against COVID-19 is chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), which is already approved as an antimalarial (and for extraintestinal amebiasis) [41, 48] . Results of the clinical trials currently underway in the U.S. and China will provide crucial information about whether remdesivir represents a viable treatment option for COVID-19 [20, 49] . If the trial findings are ultimately positive, it will be imperative to ensure that the drug is produced on a commercial scale capable of meeting the demand generated by both the current pandemic and future outbreaks. Such a change in production may also allow for the added benefit of the drug becoming more available for agricultural and veterinary use for relevant indications. ",
