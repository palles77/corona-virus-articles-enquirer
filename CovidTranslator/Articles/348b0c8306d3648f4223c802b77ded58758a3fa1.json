Most children (90%) have radiographic abnormalities on presentation to the hospital. The primary radiographic finding in paediatric patients with SARS was air-space opacification, which can be focal or multiple. Children of younger age usually present with focal segmental consolidation. A few teenage patients, who presented with a more severe disease and required oxygen therapy, had bilateral lung involvement and multi-focal consolidation [15] (Fig. 7) . In general, the consolidative changes on chest radiography in children are less extensive than adults. The majority of children showed slight radiographic deterioration on serial chest radiographs with a mean peak on day 6 after the onset of fever. Lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion and cavitation are not features of paediatric SARS, in contrast to the more common paediatric chest infections such as tuberculosis [16] and pneumococcal pneumonia [17] . At the time of writing of this review, all the patients in our initial cohort have recovered with complete resolution of radiographic changes.",
