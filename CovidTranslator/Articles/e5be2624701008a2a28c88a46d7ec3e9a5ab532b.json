            "text": "Autophagy is a physiological activity in which organisms rely on lysosomes to self-degrade their own macromolecular proteins and damaged organelles (Zhao et al., 2018) . However, the mechanism of how autophagy involved in PCV2 replication is still unclear. The ORF5 protein, a newly identified protein encoded by PCV2 has been demonstrated located to the endoplasmic reticulum and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in host cells (Lv et al., 2015) . Upon the viral infection, unfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum and trigger the unfolded protein reaction (UPR) and eventually leads to ERS (Rabinowitz and White, 2010) . During hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the silence of PERK signaling pathway in the UPR led to decreased autophagy and the titer of the virus also decreased (Wang et al., 2014) . In addition, Bluetongue virus (BTV) infection activates the PERK/eIF2\u03b1 pathway to mediate autophagy and promote viral replication (Wang et al., 2009) . Furthermore, the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway also plays a key role in regulating autophagy (Hay and Sonenberg, 2004) . After mammalian synthesis of LC3 (autophagy marker light chain 3), a small stretch of peptide chain at the end of LC3I is cleaved to form LC3II under the catalytic shear of Atg3, Atg4, and Atg7, and this process is a key step in the extension of autophagosome membrane (Fujita et al., 2008) . In mammalian cells, adenosine monophosphates-activated protein kinase (AMPK) negatively regulates mTOR by activating TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex-2) protein (Madeo et al., 2015) . Also it is reported that I, III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), reactive oxygen species (ROS)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and AMPK are involved in the formation of autophagosomes (Zhou et al., 2015; Zhong et al., 2017) . In this study, we aimed to investigated the effect of PCV2 ORF5 protein on autophagy. We found that ORF5 play important roles in PCV2-activated autophagy. Remarkably, we found that ORF5 facilitate viral replication through PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 and AMPK-ERK1/2-mTOR pathways.",

The result demonstrated that p-PERK, p-eIF2\u03b1, ATF4, and LC3II were induced by ORF5. Interestingly, the expression of these host factors were also greatly induced by PCV2 infection, but were lees induced by PCV2 ORF5 infection. The protein expression level of p-PERK, p-eIF2\u03b1, and LC3II in PCV2-infected group cells was higher than that in PCV2 ORF5 infected cells (Figures 2A,B) . This result indicates that ORF5 protein activates the phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2\u03b1. To further demonstrate that ORF5 induce autophagy by PERK, the GSK2606414 used to block the PERK pathway and the expression of its downstream factors eIF2\u03b1 and ATF4 was determined. The results showed that the expression of p-eIF2\u03b1 and ATF4 were significantly lower in the GSK2606414 pretreatment group than in the EGFP-ORF5 transfection group cells (Figures 2C,D) . The MTT assay showed that cell viability was no significant affected among those conditions ( Figure 2E) .

            "text": "PCV2 is related to lymphoid degeneration and tissue cell infiltration and induces autophagy (Sinha et al., 2012) . The potential function of PCV2 encoding viral proteins has not been fully understood. In the previous study, we demonstrated ORF5 protein of PCV2 is localized to the ER and to induce ERS (Lv et al., 2015) . In this study, we focused on the relationship between ORF5 protein and host autophagy. First, we demonstrated that ORF5 protein induced the phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2\u03b1. In addition, the expression level of transcription factor ATF4 is also induced by ORF5 protein in PK-15 cells. PERK is one of the sensors that transmits UPR signals in ERS (Ron and Walter, 2007) . In following study, we demonstrated that the PCV2 ORF5 protein could also suppress the activation of mTOR pathway, which induces autophagy (Figure 3) . It had been reported that Dengue virus (DENV) infection can activate UPR and induce autophagy andPERK-eIF2\u03b1 and IRE1\u03b1-JNK signaling pathways increase autophagy and viral load after DENV infection (Lee et al., 2018) . Besides, early infection with dengue virus type 2 (DENV2) triggers PERKmediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Pena and Harris, 2011) . PCV2 infection induces ERS and activates the PERK/eIF2\u03b1 pathway in UPR, and ERS may play a role in PCV2 infection as part of autophagy and apoptosis , as well as the PERK pathway also regulates autophagosome formation . The Rep and Cap proteins of PCV2 induced UPR by the phosphorylation of PERK with subsequent activation of the eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 pathway (Zhou et al., 2017) . In the present study, we showed that ORF5 protein activates eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 expression by phosphorylating PERK which is consistent with the above studies. We found PCV2 ORF5 phosphorylates PERK and eIF2\u03b1 also up-regulate the expression of LC3II. This might due to the phosphorylation of PERK accumulates eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), which leads to the formation of Atg5/Atg12/Atg16L complex (Kang et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018) . The LC3I is hydrolyzed and cleaved into an active LC3II, thereby mediating the extension of the autophagosome membrane. The mTOR-ERK1/2-AMPK is also found affected by ORF5 protein in this study. AMPK plays an important role in the regulation of autophagy and proteolysis in mammalian cells (Meley et al., 2006) and autophagy induced by non-starvationrelated factors act primarily through activation of AMPK (Hoyer-Hansen et al., 2007) . Autophagy mediates enhanced AMPK activity in human breast and cervical cancer cells (Hoyer-Hansen et al., 2007) and activated AMPK initiate autophagosome formation by activating PIK3C3/VPS34 complex or by inhibiting mTOR (Xie et al., 2016) and regulate ERK1/2 (Kim et al., 2012) . These opposite effects are due to complex intermodulation and constraints among the AMPK, ERK1/2, and mTOR signaling pathways. ORF5 induces phosphorylation of AMPK, thereby enhancing the activity of ERK1/2, but negatively regulating mTOR since inhibiting the phosphorylation of mTOR, the cleavage of LC3-I to LC3-II is enhanced, and the autophagy is induced.",

Some RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm can apply the bilayer membrane structure of autophagic vacuoles as a site of attachment to resist cell clearance. For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (Coronavirus, SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) can simultaneously detect LC3 II and virus in autophagosomes after infection of cells (de Haan et al., 2010) . In conjunction with that PCV2 promotes its own replication by autophagy, ORF5 protein phosphorylates the PERK-eIF2\u03b1 pathway and activates the expression of the downstream factor ATF4, which significantly increases the viral capsid protein as well as the PCV2 DNA copy number, the replication capacity of PCV2 is reduced when PERK was blocked by GSK2606414. This indicates that ERS produced by ORF5 promotes the formation of autophagosomes and has a beneficial effect on the replication of PCV2. This consistent with previous studies that PCV2 infection of PK-15 cells induces autophagy and significantly decreases FIGURE 8 | ORF5 protein promotes PCV2 replication by PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 pathway.
