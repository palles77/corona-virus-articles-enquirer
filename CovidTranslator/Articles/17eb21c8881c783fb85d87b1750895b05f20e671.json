This RNA was shown to encode the viral nucleocapsid protein by direct in vitro translation in a cell-free, reticulocyte-derived system. Single stranded q-labeled complementary DNA was prepared from this RNA and was demonstrated to be virus specific. Using this complementary DNA in a Northern blotting procedure, we were able to identify six major virus-specific intracellular RNA species with estimated molecular weights of 0.8, 1.1, 1.4, 1.6, 3, and 4 X l@ daltons. All of these RNA species were polyadenylated. Our results support the idea that coronavirus-infected cells contain multiple intracellular polyadenylated RNAs which share common sequences. et al., 1959) of mouse fibroblasts.",

Although little is known about the RNA replication strategy of coronaviruses, Stern and Kennedy (1980a, b) have recently identified a set of five polyadenylated subgenomic RNAs in cells infected with the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Oligonucleotide fingerprint analysis of these RNAs suggested common sequences among them (Stern and Kennedy, 1980a, b) . Evidence for multiple intracellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs) has also been presented in the case of another coronavirus, i To whom reprint requests should be addressed. murine hepatitis virus (MHV). Siddell et al. (1980) reported the separation of polyadenylated RNAs from MHV (JHM strain)-infected cells by means of sucrose gradients; fractions from these gradients were able to direct the in vitro translation of two viral proteins. However, the limited degree of resolution obtainable on sucrose gradients makes a more definitive analysis of MHV subgenomic RNAs highly desirable.",

The fractions containing the single-stranded [32P]cDNA (approximately 80% of the total radioactivity applied) were collected, pooled, and used for the subsequent experiments.

As expected, this cDNA annealed predominantly with a 0.8 X lo6 dalton RNA species in A59-infected L cell RNA (Fig. 4, lane A) . However, the cDNA also showed significant annealing with five other RNA species with estimated molecular weights of 1.1, 1.4, 1.6, 3 and 4 X 106. (Fig. 4, lane A) . Similar results were obtained using poly(A)-selected A59-infected L cell RNA (Fig. 4, lane B) , indi-cating that all the observed RNA species, which share homology with the [=P]cDNA, were polyadenylated. These RNA species were visible in autoradiograms within several hours of exposure. In contrast to these results with infected L cell RNA, the cDNA showed no annealing with either uninfected L cell RNA (Fig. 4, lane C) or poly (A)-selected, uninfected L cell RNA (Fig. 4, lane D) . Furthermore, the cDNA showed no annealing with RNA which was poly(A) selected from as much as one mil- Nomenclature of viral proteins is as proposed by Sturman et al.

The specificity of the cDNA prepared from 0.8 X lo6 dalton RNA was further tested by annealing it with tRNA, uninfected L cell RNA, poly(A)-selected, uninfected L cell RNA, and A59-infected L cell RNA. Actinomycin D was added to the A59-infected L cells to prevent the expression of endogenous L cell genes (including retrovirus genes). The results are shown in Table 1 . The tRNA hybridization data indicated that the [32P]cDNA showed no significant self annealing. In addition, the [32P]cDNA showed less than 10% annealing with either uninfected, or poly(A)-selected, uninfected L cell RNA. Thus, in agreement with the RNA transfer results, the cDNA had little if any homology with uninfected L cell RNA. In contrast, the cDNA annealed completely with A59-infected L cell RNA with a C&of 5 X low2 (using data from Table 1 ). This result, using the calculation of Varmus et al.

Taken together, the evidence suggests that coronaviruses, as exemplified by MHV and IBV, code for five to six polyadanylated subgenomic RNAs whose molecular weights lie within the range of approximately 0.8-4 X 106. The existence of homologous sequences within a set of viral RNAs suggests parallels with certain other positive-strand RNA viruses. In the replication of the alphavirus, Semliki Forest virus, structural and nonstructural polypeptides are translated from a 26 S RNA and a 42 S RNA, respectively. A copy of 26 S RNA sequence is present within the 42 S RNA molecule, although translation of the 42 S RNA appears to yield only nonstructural polypeptides (Glanville et aZ., 1976) . It has been suggested in studies with Semliki Forest virus (Glanville et al., 1976) as well as certain plant viruses (Shih and Kaesberg, 1973; Hunter et al., 1976) and polyoma virus (Hunter and Gibson, 1978 ) that translational initiation of eukaryotic mRNAs may occur at only a single site near the 5' terminus, and that additional coding regions located further downstream are not translated. Thus, the transcription of a set of viral mRNAs which share 3' end sequence homology but differ in length may be a common effective mechanism to ensure translational initiation of all viral genes by the host cell.",

Using reported molecular weight estimates for the three major viral structural proteins of A59 (Sturman et cd., 1980) , i.e., a 18OK dalton glycoprotein, a 50K nucleocapsid protein, and a 23K protein, it can be calculated that somewhat less than half of the total coding capacity of the genome is occupied by sequences encoding these structural polypeptides. The remainder of the genome would presumably comprise nonstructural protein-encoding regions as well as any noncoding regions. Experiments performed on the JHM strain of MHV (Siddell et aZ., 1980) suggest that at least two viral structural polypeptides are encoded by separate mRNAs rather than by a single polycistronic mRNA as in the case of other positive-strand viruses such as alphaviruses (Mowshowitz, 1973) or enteroviruses such as poliovirus (Jacobson and Baltimore, 1968) . Our own studies with MHV (Cheley and Anderson, in press) have shown that each of the three major structural polypeptides is translationally initiated in an independent rather than in a sequential manner; this result is again indicative of the existence of separate viral mRNAs for each structural protein.",
