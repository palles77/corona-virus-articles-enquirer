Abstract 28 Approximately 15-20% of COVID-19 patients will develop severe 29 pneumonia, about 10 % of which will die if not properly managed. Earlier 30 discrimination of the potential severe patients basing on routine clinical and 31 laboratory changes and commencement of prophylactical management will not 32 only save their lives but also mitigate the otherwise overwhelmed health care 33 burden. In this retrospective investigation, the clinical and laboratory features 34 were collected from 125 COVID-19 patients, who were classified into mild (93 35 cases) or severe (32 cases) groups according to their clinical outcomes after 3 36 to 7-days post-admission. The subsequent analysis with single-factor and 37 multivariate logistic regression methods indicated that 17 factors on admission 38 differed significantly between mild and severe groups, but that only comorbid 39 with underlying diseases, increased respiratory rate (>24/min), elevated C-40 reactive protein (CRP >10mg/liter), and lactate dehydrogenase 41 (LDH >250U/liter), were independently associated with the later disease 42 development. Finally, we evaluated their prognostic values with the receiver 43 operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis and found that the above four 44 factors could not confidently predict the occurrence of severe pneumonia 45 individually, but that a combination of fast respiratory rate and elevated LDH 46 significantly increased the predictive confidence (AUC= 0.944, sensitivity= 47 329 Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia",
