A pandemic with a basic reproductive number (R 0 ) of 2.5 resulted in peak absenteeism of 10%. Treatment decreased peak absenteeism to 8%, while 8 weeks' prophylaxis reduced it to 2%. For pandemics with higher R 0 , peak absenteeism exceeded 20% occasionally and 6 weeks' prophylaxis reduced peak absenteeism by 75%. Insufficient duration of prophylaxis increased peak absenteeism compared with treatment only. Earlier pandemic detection and initiation of prophylaxis may render shorter prophylaxis durations ineffective. Eight weeks' prophylaxis substantially reduced peak absenteeism under a broad range of assumptions for severe pandemics (peak absenteeism >10%). Small investments in treatment and prophylaxis, if adequate and timely, can reduce absenteeism among essential staff.",

Different predetermined prophylaxis substrategies were considered, based on the weeks of prophylaxis; each additional week required 140,000 doses in addition to separate treatment stockpiles. To be conservative, we assumed that prophylaxis stockpiles would last only for the planned duration. Separate analyses explored the effect of stopping prophylaxis after individual clinical infection, with redistribution of prophylaxis doses to other HCWs to prolong prophylaxis beyond the planned duration; however, this strategy is only possible if tests can promptly confirm individual infection and logistics networks allow for redistribution.",

The first source was exposures from colleagues (HCW-to-HCW transmission) at a proportion (\u03c9); the second was from persons outside the workplace (1-\u03c9). In the absence of published estimates, the base case assumed that 50% of infections were attributed to HCW-to-HCW transmission, with sensitivity analysis performed from 20% to 80%. The third source was from general population case-patients (patient-to-HCW transmission), expressed as the ratio of susceptible HCWs who could be infected by incident case-patients who sought treatment from the healthcare system (H/P). The extent of transmission is dependent on interventions such as barrier precautions (11) . On the basis of findings from exploratory analysis, increasing the H/P ratio moves the HCW epidemic earlier; at an H/P of 2.08, the HCW epidemic peaks before the start of prophylaxis, negating the outcomes of prophylaxis. Therefore, H/P values >2 do not substantially contribute to the outcomes and study conclusions, and sensitivity analysis was performed for H/P from 0 to 2 (online Technical Appendix, available at www.cdc.gov/EID/ content/13/3/449_app.htm).

Higher HCW-to-HCW transmission resulted in an increased postprophylaxis epi- demic peak. The HCW epidemic coincided with the general population epidemic if the patient-to-HCW infections variable was minimized (H/P = 0). Increasing H/P alone shifted the HCW epidemic such that it preceded the general population epidemic and amplified peak absenteeism by as much as 1.4\u00d7 for the base case. For the prophylaxis strategies, increasing the patient-to-HCW transmission resulted in the distribution of HCW absenteeism away from the postprophylaxis period into the pre-and intraprophylaxis periods, which resulted in lower peak absenteeism up to a point. For H/P >2.0, peak absenteeism occurred before initiation of prophylaxis, negating the effect of longer durations of prophylaxis. Under all HCW-to-HCW and patientto-HCW transmission scenarios for a base-case pandemic, 6 weeks of prophylaxis provided equal or superior results to treatment only; 8 weeks of prophylaxis was always superior (Online Technical Appendix). Figure 4 shows the changes in peak absenteeism when latent and infectious periods were varied. For any rate of growth, assuming different latent periods changed peak absenteeism by <1% for most scenarios; assuming longer infectious periods increased peak absenteeism by <3%. However, epidemics with higher growth rates for any latent and infectious periods increased peak absenteeism by >10% when no action was taken. Although changes in the transmission parameters substantially changed peak absenteeism levels for certain scenarios, the overall conclusions remained similar. For epidemics with low peak absenteeism (<10%) and prolonged duration (low growth rate), prophylaxis strategies were less effective than treatment only. In contrast, for epidemics with higher peak absenteeism (>10%) and shorter duration (high growth rate), prophylaxis of >6 weeks was superior to treatment only. Figure 5 shows the adequacy of prophylaxis for a base-case pandemic under different prophylaxis initiation points based on pandemic detection. Earlier detection and prophylaxis initiation resulted in a greater likelihood that shorter durations of prophylaxis would be ineffective. If prophylaxis were initiated on entry of the first pandemic case, 14 weeks of prophylaxis would be required for maximal benefit. Prophylaxis for 6 weeks was more effective than treatment only if it was initiated when incident pandemic cases in the general population exceeded 10% of the ILI rate, whereas 8 weeks of prophylaxis was effective when incident pandemic cases exceeded 1%.",

            "text": "During an influenza pandemic, essential services such as healthcare must be maintained, especially during the pandemic's peak, when the maximal number of patients require care, and healthcare services can ill afford absenteeism due to infection. Absenteeism may also occur for reasons such as background illnesses and the need to care for ill relatives. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in Singapore in 2003, schools were closed for weeks. Although no study documented the resultant workplace absenteeism, parents may have taken time off to care for their children. The New Zealand government has predicted overall absenteeism levels as high as 40% (20) , and actual pandemic workplace absenteeism levels will likely exceed those shown in this study. Treatment and timely use of prophylaxis with neuraminidase inhibitors reduce HCW absenteeism compared with no action. As shown in previous studies, treatment provides benefits over no action and should be considered in preparedness plans to reduce illness and death (2, 3, 21) . Using prophylaxis to prevent infection results in a secondary increase in infections after prophylaxis is stopped because HCWs remain susceptible at a time when transmission in the general population is ongoing. Insufficient durations of prophylaxis thus result in poorer outcomes than treatment only. For prophylaxis strategies to accrue more benefits than treatment only, the prophylaxis duration must be sufficient to cover the pandemic's peak. Eight weeks of prophylaxis, the maximum safe duration previously studied (22) , was sufficient to provide a substantial reduction in peak absenteeism under a broad range of assumptions for more severe pandemics where peak absenteeism exceeded 10%. Six weeks of prophylaxis was marginally beneficial, if one assumes that prophylaxis was initiated after incident pandemic cases exceeded 10% of the baseline ILI rate.",

Improved surveillance, critical for early detection, paradoxically increases the likelihood of initiating prophylaxis too early, causing predetermined stockpile durations to be inadequate. Many countries have developed comprehensive preparedness plans to reduce a pandemic's spread. These may prolong the pandemic's duration within the country, which would compound the issue of stockpile adequacy. If prophylaxis is started prematurely, stockpiles will be exhausted before the delayed waves of the pandemic occur and thus will not reduce absenteeism more than would treatment only. Prophylaxis should not be initiated until a certain point in the epidemic curve, but this may be difficult, given public sentiment and pressure. Further studies are needed to determine the ideal time for prophylaxis initiation and the role of surveillance in evaluating the pandemic phases and projected spread.",

Another limitation is that effects over the entire HCW population were aggregated. In reality, subsets of HCWs exist with varying levels of exposure. Stochastic variation and nosocomial outbreaks, which were not modeled, may result in higher local absenteeism rates than predicted by this model. Further studies that use individual-based stochastic models may provide improved representation of disease transmission to test other interventions. Studies should also consider modeling the effect of multiple pandemic waves. Finally, the study parameters used were based on historical data; the validity of the projections will depend on how the next pandemic compares with its precedents.",
