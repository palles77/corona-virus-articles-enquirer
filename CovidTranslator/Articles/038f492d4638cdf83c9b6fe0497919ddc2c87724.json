We have previously shown that the E protein from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) forms cationselective ion channels in planar lipid bilayers (Wilson, L., McKinlay, C., Gage, P., Ewart, G., 2004. SARS coronavirus E protein forms cationselective ion channels. Virology 330(1), 322-331). We now report that three other E proteins also form cation-selective ion channels. These E proteins were from coronaviruses representative of taxonomic groups 1-3: human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), respectively. It appears, therefore, that coronavirus E proteins in general, belong to the virus ion channels family. Hexamethylene amiloride (HMA)an inhibitor of the HIV-1 Vpu virus ion channelinhibited the HCoV-229E and MHV E protein ion channel conductance in bilayers and also inhibited replication of the parent coronaviruses in cultured cells, as determined by plaque assay. Conversely, HMA had no antiviral effect on a recombinant MHV with the entire coding region of E protein deleted (MHV\u0394E). Taken together, the data provide evidence of a link between inhibition of E protein ion channel activity and the antiviral activity of HMA.",

However, for the two best characterized virus ion channels -M2 protein from influenza A and Vpu from HIV-1ion channel activity has been strongly linked to roles in the virus's life cycles by studies with mutants and channel blocking drugs (Hout et al., 2005a (Hout et al., , 2005b Pinto et al., 1992; Sakaguchi et al., 1996; Schubert et al., 1996) . The M2 ion channel activity is inhibited by amantadine and some of its derivatives, and these are currently used in the clinical treatment of influenza A infections (Fleming, 2001; Pinto et al., 1992) . We have demonstrated that the Vpu ion channel activity in planar lipid bilayers is blocked by the amiloride derivate HMA, and that HMA also inhibits replication of HIV-1 in cultured human macrophages . For some other viral ion channels, inhibitors have also been discovered (Griffin et al., 2003; Pavlovic et al., 2003; Premkumar et al., 2005; Premkumar et al., 2004) , although evidence of antiviral activity of the compounds has not yet been published.

The full-length peptides, with predicted molecular weights of 9092.9, 9660.0, and 10475.4 Da, respectively, were excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels and purified as described in Materials and methods. Western blot analysis of the purified peptides ( Fig. 1) showed that all three preparations contained discrete protein bands electrophoresing at approximately the expected size of the full-length products and recognized by the appropriate peptide-specific antibodies. HCoV-229E E protein ran as a single discrete band at about its expected molecular weight, indicating that the sample contained mostly full-length protein and did not contain significantly truncated products. The MHVand IBV E samples both yielded discrete doublet bands on the blots, with in each case the smaller of the two bands running at about the expected molecular weight. It is possible that, due to their highly hydrophobic nature, the proteins may electroporese more slowly than expected, and it may be the larger of the two bands that corresponds to the full-length (or at least very near full-length) protein and the smaller band represents a truncated species. The MHV E protein was detected with an antibody that recognizes an epitope within the first 19 N-terminal amino acids (referred to as, anti-MHV EN). Since, peptide synthesis proceeds from the C-terminus to the N-terminus and because it would require about 6-amino-acid residues to form an epitope to react with the anti-MHV EN antibody, the Western blot indicates the smaller immunoreactive peptide would be truncated at the Nterminus by maximally about 13 amino acids. As predicted from MHV E protein hydropathy plot, the E protein N-terminus consists of about a 14-amino-acid hydrophilic region so even the smaller of the two immunoreactive species would contain an intact TM putative ion channel domain. The IBV E protein also ran as a doublet, and again, it is likely that the larger band represents the full-length product and the smaller band is IBV E protein with several amino acids truncated from the N-terminus. For all three synthetic peptides Western blots confirmed the presence of proteins of at least sufficient length to contain the TM putative ion channel-forming domain.",

Fig. 2A shows typical current trace in a solution containing a 10-fold gradient of NaCl (500 mM CIS: 50 mM TRANS) at a range of holding potentials. Fig. 2B shows the current-voltage (I-V) plot for this experiment, which reveals a reversal potential of about +26 mV. In nineteen similar experiments where the theoretical equilibrium potential for Na + ions was +54 mV, the average measured reversal potential was +22 \u00b1 7 mV (mean \u00b1 SEM). This indicates that the channel is weakly selective for Na + ions over Cl \u2212 ions. Using ion activities in the Goldman, Hodgkin, and Katz (GHK) equation the P Na +/P Cl \u2212 ratio was calculated to be 3, indicating that the HCoV-229E E protein ion channel is only 3 times more permeable to Na + than Cl \u2212 ions. For these 19 experiments, the average conductance was 19 \u00b1 4 pS, and the maximum conductance measured was 91 pS. Fig. 2C shows typical current traces for HCoV-229E E protein in asymmetrical KCl solution, in this experiment the K + ion current was observed to reverse at +42 mV (Fig. 2D ). In thirteen comparable experiments with a theoretical K + equilibrium potential of +54 mV, the average measured reversal potential was +38 \u00b1 4 mV. By the GHK equation, HCoV-229E E protein is 12 times more selective for K + than for Cl \u2212 ions. For the 13 experiments, the average conductance was 23 \u00b1 5 pS. The ion selectivity for HCoV-229E E protein ion channel is thus, K + > Na + > Cl \u2212 and the channel is about 4 times more permeable to K + than to Na + ions (Table 1) . The group 2 coronavirus MHV E protein forms ion channels that are sodium selective MHV E protein was tested for its ability to form ion channels in planar lipid bilayers, and experiments were done to determine the selectivity of MHV E protein for Na + ions over Cl \u2212 ions and for K + ions over Cl \u2212 . Fig. 3A shows characteristic current traces for MHV E protein ion channel activity in asymmetrical NaCl solution. In this experiment the ion current reversed at +42 mV ( Fig. 3 B) . In 14 equivalent experiments, the average reversal potential was +49 \u00b1 1 mV, which is close to the Na + equilibrium potential of +54 mV. Thus, the MHV E protein ion channel is highly selective for Na + ions and the P Na +/P Cl \u2212 ratio is 138. For the 14 experiments the conductance varied between 235 and 7 pS, with an average conductance of 61 \u00b1 16 pS. Fig. 3C illustrates representative current traces of MHV E protein ion channel activity in a 10-fold concentration gradient of KCl. In this experiment, K + ion flow was observed to reverse at +25 mV (Fig. 3D ), but after eleven similar experiments, the average reversal potential was calculated to be +13 \u00b1 6 mV, indicating that MHV E protein ion channel is only 2 times more selective for K + over Cl \u2212 ions. The conductance for the 11 experiments ranged from 60 to 6 pS with an average of 18 \u00b1 5 pS. The ion selectivity order for MHV E protein ion channel was Na + \u226b K + > Cl \u2212 , with the channel being about 69 times more permeable to Na + than K + ions. Thus, the MHV E protein ion channel distinguishes between monovalent cations and is highly selective for Na + ions (Table 1) . The group 3 coronavirus IBV E protein forms ion channels that prefer sodium IBV E protein also forms ion channels in planar lipid bilayers and experiments conducted in NaCl and KCl solutions demonstrated that IBV E protein channels have a slight preference for Na + ions over K + ions, similar to E protein channels from the group 2 coronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV . Fig. 4A shows typical current traces of IBV E protein ion channel conductance in asymmetrical NaCl solution. In this experiment, the Na + ion flow was observed to reverse at +30 mV (Fig. 4B ). In 13 independent experiments, the average reversal potential was +36 \u00b1 5 mV and the IBV E protein P Na+ /P Cl \u2212 ratio was 10. For the 13 experiments, the conductance was variable, the highest conductance measured was 77 pS, with an average conductance of 24 \u00b1 5 pS. The I-V relationship for the IBV E protein in NaCl solution was nonlinear, indicating rectification of the ion channel. The channel conductance was smaller when the TRANS chamber was held at positive potentials relative to the CIS chamber than when the polarity was reversed.",

To demonstrate that the ion channel activities we were observing were specifically due to the HCoV-229E or MHV E proteins, rather than a contaminant in samples, purified epitopespecific antibodies recognizing these proteins were utilized. In some previously published cases, such antibodies have been shown to inhibit ion channel activity directly in bilayer experiments. This inhibition depends on binding of the antibody to an exposed epitope and either physical blocking of the ion channel by the antibody or induction of a conformational change in the ion channel structure that inactivates it. However, for many antibodies, simple binding of the antibody may not be sufficient to inactivate the target ion channel. So alternatively, the antibodies can be used to remove the ion channel-forming peptide from solution (Ewart et al., 1996; Melton et al., 2002) .",

The plaque overlay on the MHV infected L2 cells slows diffusion of the newly emerged virus, which then infect adjacent cells, resulting in larger plaques than in the L929 cells. HMA was tested on MHV infection in L2 cells at 20 \u03bcM, which is significantly above the EC 50 measured in L929 cells (Table 2 ), but removed from toxicity (as determined by MTT cytotoxicity assay). To determine if the MHV E protein was the antiviral target, HMA was also tested for its ability to inhibit the recombinant MHV with the entire E protein deleted (MHV\u0394E). MHV\u0394E replicates to low titer and has a small plaque phenotype in L2 cells (Kuo and Masters, 2003) . Therefore, it is expected if compounds were targeting the MHV E protein, replication of MHV\u0394E would not be affected. Furthermore, if HMA was targeting the MHV E protein the plaque phenotype of MHV wild-type in the presence of HMA would be comparable to the MHV\u0394E small plaque phenotype. Fig. 8 shows that the MHV wild-type virus in mouse L2 cells has a large plaque phenotype of about 3-4 mm in diameter in the absence of antiviral compound (Fig. 8A1) . In the presence of 20 \u03bcM HMA the plaque size is reduced to about 1 mm (Fig. 8A2) , about the same size as the MHV\u0394E plaques (Fig. 8B1) . Conversely, 20 \u03bcM of amiloride did not reduce MHV plaque size (Fig. 8A3) . Moreover, none of the amiloride derivatives tested notably inhibited MHV\u0394E plaque formation ( Fig. 8B1-3) , indicating that MHV E protein is the probable antiviral target.",

Our data demonstrate that the E proteins from HCoV-229E, MHV, and IBVrepresentative of coronavirus taxonomic groups 1, 2, and 3, respectivelyform cationselective ion channels in planar lipid bilayers. In the cases of HCoV-229E and MHV, epitope-specific antibodies were used to confirm that the channel-forming species in test samples was indeed the purified synthetic E protein. The anti-HCoV-229E E antibody, which binds on the C-terminal side of the transmembrane helix, did not inhibit channel activity in bilayers. However, when this antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the E protein, the residual supernatant did not form ion channels. The anti-MHV EN antibody inhibits the MHV E ion channel activity when added to one chamber (but not the other) of the bilayer rig, indicating that the N-terminus of the peptide is exposed on the CIS side of the bilayer. Further, this shows that the peptides are aligned in a parallel, rather than antiparallel, conformation in the presumed homo-oligomer that forms the ion channel.",

Such broad-spectrum inhibition by HMA suggests that the drug-binding sites of these channels from diverse viruses share structural similarities. Another example of one compound inhibiting different ion channels is amantadine, which blocks both influenza A M2 (Pinto et al., 1992; Sugrue and Hay, 1991) , HCV p7 (Griffin et al., 2003) and Dengue M protein channels (Premkumar et al., 2005) . HMA does not block the IBV E protein ion channel suggestive of a more divergent structure of this group 3 coronavirus E protein. In this regard, models of the membrane topology of the IBV and MHV E proteins are quite different (Corse and Machamer, 2000; Maeda et al., 2001) . The rectified I-V plot observed in NaCl solutions (Fig. 4B) is also indicative of unique properties of the IBV E protein channels that warrant further investigation.",

Amantadine's clinical use against influenza A infections is the clearest evidence of this and the mechanism of action of the M2 channel in virus replication has been well characterized. We have shown that HMAa blocker of the Vpu ion channelinhibits replication of HIV-1 in cultured human primary macrophages , but in this case, the underlying mechanistic links remain to be uncovered. In this manuscript, we report that in addition to blocking E protein ion channels, HMA also inhibits replication of HCoV-229E and MHV. Conversely, HMA at 20 \u03bcM does not inhibit the recombinant virus, MHV\u0394E, with the entire E protein deleted (see . Taken together, the data imply that the antiviral target of HMA is the E protein, and further, that the E protein ion channel activity is important for coronavirus replication. Other groups have previously provided evidence for the importance of E protein for replication of MHV and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), a group 1 coronavirus (Kuo and Masters, 2003; Ortego et al., 2002) . Deletion of the open reading frame encoding the E protein from the genome of MHV results in a strongly attenuated virus with a small plaque phenotype (Kuo and Masters, 2003) . This indicates that, while the E protein has important roles in the MHV life cycle, it is not essential for in vitro replication of MHV. In contrast, the E gene is thought to be essential for replication of TGEV (Ortego et al., 2002) .",

It is possible that the functional similarities and differences may be related to the ion channel selectivities of the E protein channels, which we found to be more similar between groups 2 and 3 E channels (prefer Na + ions) than group 1 (prefers K + ions). Of course, more ion channel selectivity and complementation studies are required to confirm these early observations.",

Briefly, a lipid mix of 3:1:1 1palmitoyl-2-oleolyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine:1-palmitoyl-2oleolyl phosphatidyl serine:1-palmitoyl-2-oleolyl phosphatidyl choline in chloroform were dried under N 2 gas and resuspended in n-decane. Bilayers were painted across a circular hole of approximately 100 \u03bcm diameter in a Delrin cup separating aqueous solutions in the CIS and TRANS chambers. For testing E protein selectivity for Na + and Cl \u2212 ions, the solution in the CIS chamber consisted of 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), while the solution in the TRANS chamber contained 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.2). For testing E protein selectivity for K + and Cl \u2212 ions, the solution in the CIS chamber consisted of 500 mM KCl and 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), while the solution in the TRANS chamber contained 50 mM KCl and 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.2).

Typically, when present, ion channel activity was detected after about 5-15 min of stirring. The CIS chamber was earthed and the TRANS chamber was held at a range of potentials between +100 mV to \u2212100 mV. The voltage (V m ) vs. the current (I) were plotted (I-V plot) to determine the reversal potential (V r ), which indicates the ion selectivity of the channel. The theoretical V r for a Na + or K + selective channel in our experimental set up was +54 mV, whereas the theoretical V r for a Cl \u2212 channel was \u221254 mV (using activities in the Nernst equation). The V r was used in the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation to determine the relative permeability ratios (P Na +/P Cl \u2212 or P K +/P Cl \u2212) of the ion channel.",
