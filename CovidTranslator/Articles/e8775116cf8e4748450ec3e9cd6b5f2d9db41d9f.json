The tourism industry suffered the most, experiencing the highest stock price decline (approximately 29 percent) within a month of the SARS outbreak. This research examined the effect of the SARS epidemic on Taiwanese hotel stock price movements using an event-study approach. Seven publicly traded hotel companies experienced steep declines in earnings and stock price during the SARS outbreak period. On and after the day of the SARS outbreak, Taiwanese hotel stocks showed significantly negative cumulative mean abnormal returns, indicating a significant impact of the SARS outbreak on hotel stock performance. Empirical findings could be used to prepare businesses for the similar epidemics, such as a deadly bird-flu epidemic. r",

Some doctors blamed the government for the growing public panic, claiming that its draconian anti-SARS measures have only undermined attempts to control the disease. For example, Taipei officials proposed an automatic 3-day quarantine for anyone with a fever. The Department of Health banned the sale of anti-fever pills at drugstores in hopes of encouraging possible SARS sufferers consult their doctors. Most Taipei roads were gridlocked by 7:00 a.m., since a government order that required all subway and train passengers to wear masks caused commuters to avoid using public transportation.",

The SARS outbreak also tarnished Taiwan's international image and brought about social disorder, both of which harmed its economic growth. The impact of SARS on the national economy appeared to be a short-term phenomenon, but the magnitude of the impact was not minimal.

Several hotels catering to Japanese visitors, the primary international tourist market, lost as much as half of their Japanese bookings, and resorted to a price reduction program to lure more tourists, thus resulting in an even greater loss of their sales revenue. Thus, many hotels tried to cut costs by closing unoccupied floors or ordering employees to take unpaid leave (China Post, 2003c) .

In terms of the 1-month change in earnings, the hotel companies experienced drops in earnings in a range of \u00c049.81% to \u00c011.14%.

Such a finding indicated that hotel stocks, on average, were exposed to above-market-average risk during the SARS outbreak period, which is consistent with the common perception that the hotel industry is most vulnerable to a decrease in the number of tourists. It suggests that investors expect hotel stock prices to react negatively to a future epidemic and ask for a higher return to compensate for higher risk. Table 4 presents the CARs for four models and ten industries within the 10-day event windows before the SARS outbreak. As shown in Table 4 , the estimated CARs during the 10-day period prior to the SARS outbreak were not statistically significant across all the models and industries. Thus, these results indicated that the value of CAR for the hotel industry as well as the other industries was not different from zero in the absence of the SARS influence and no significant abnormal returns were witnessed before SARS outbreak (Table 5) In comparison, the estimated CARs over the event window (0, 10), i.e. the 10-day period after SARS outbreak, the negative CARs were found to be statistically significant at the 5% level for seven out of ten industry sectors. However, only for the hotel and foods industries among those seven sectors, the negative CARs of all four models were statistically significant at the 5% level.

A contagion effect prevails in case that unpredictability concerning some stocks is transferred to other stocks in the same or related industry. Among different segments of the tourism industry, stock prices of hotels could have immediate negative reaction right after the SARS outbreak, and other industry segments such as restaurant, travel agency, rental car companies could also be directly exposed to significantly negative stock market returns. The influence of the SARS outbreak on the tourism industry was quickly assimilated into declining stock prices in reality. Thus, accompanied by a sharp decline in sales revenue and cash flow due to significant decrease in occupancy and average daily rate, a widespread panic caused stakeholders who invested in hotels to perceive higher risk and to require higher rate of return for their investment in Taiwan. Therefore, hotel investors considered their stocks over-valued, resulting in sell-off of their stocks.",

By measuring the cumulative abnormal hotel returns 10 days prior to the SARS outbreak (days \u00c010 and \u00c01) and comparing the results to those after the 10 days (days 1 and 10) and 20 days (days 1 and 20) of the SARS outbreak, the impact of the SARS outbreak on hotel stock prices was examined. The results indicated that the estimated cumulative abnormal returns before the SARS outbreak were not statistically different from zero, supporting that there would be no abnormal return when the SARS was not an issue.",

These results confirmed that the SARS outbreak had a significantly negative impact on the hotel stocks in Taiwan. It is also noteworthy that the negative cumulative abnormal hotel returns after the 20 days of the SARS outbreak became intensified when compared to the models of the ten calibration days. The results indicate that since the first case was found, more infected and death cases were reported and these cases reinforced the debilitating impact on the stock values of hotel companies.",

The SARS outbreak demonstrated the fragility of the hotel business toward an epidemic and a new epidemic could likely depress stock markets in Taiwan and South-East Asia. Thus, in order to minimize the possible negative impact on the firm's financial performance or stock prices if a similar epidemic like the bird-flu occurs, hotel management in Taiwan and other South-East Asian countries should prepare preventive remedies to improve the stock market's negative response to the crisis. Top management should sustain the confidence level of hotel investors by reducing their uncertainty of hotel stocks in the market; thus an irrational market response such as panic or stock sell-offs may not be as severe or durable as before. Thus, it may be important for hotel management to widely advertise, on the occurrence of a similar disease, that the abnormal impact would be a temporary phenomenon as evidenced in this study.",
