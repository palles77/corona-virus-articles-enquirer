First, keeping the trifluoromethylketone moiety in place, we investigated chemical modifications on the side chain of Glu or Gln residue at the P1 position, in order to block the formation of the cyclic structure (Scheme 1) and modulate the hydrogen bonding ability of this P1 position toward the active site, as well as modifying the amino acid residues at the P2 and P3 positions. Second, we investigated a replacement of the chemical warhead of the inhibitor, that is, the trifluoromethyl unit, by other moieties such as electron-withdrawing thiazolyl and benzothiazolyl groups. We believe that this modification would be valuable for enhancing the reactivity of the covalent-adduct formation to the active site cysteine residue in SARS-CoV 3CL pro .",

The inhibition assay was performed using a procedure mentioned earlier. 14a In our previous report, compounds 1a,b (Scheme 1) were found to be moderate SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors with K i values of 116 and 135 lM, respectively ( Table 1 , entries 1 and 2). These compounds were used as leads for structural optimization in the development of potent SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors. Compound 8a was our first attempt at modifying the P1 residue by converting the c-carboxylic acid of compound 1a to a N,Ndiethylamide. However, compound 8a exhibited lower inhibitory activity than lead compound 1a. A plausible reason for the observed low activity could be attributed to a disruption of hydrogen bonding interactions at the P1 position with the active site of the enzyme, or an unfavorable steric hindrance to a covalent bond formation at the CF 3 -ketone moiety with the active site cysteine residue in the enzyme. On the other hand, replacements of P1 N,Ndiethylamide in compound 8a with N-morpholine-and N,N-methylbenzyl-amides increased the inhibitory activity (Table 1 , entries 4 and 5). Indeed, the activity of compounds 8b and 8c with K i values of 21.0 and 34.1 lM, respectively, was fivefold higher affinity than reference compound 1a. Next, to develop smaller sized inhibitors, we prepared CF 3 -ketone compounds 8d and 8e containing the same P1 structure as compound 8a but different peptide chain lengths, because peptide chain length plays a significant role in the inhibition of enzymes by forming crucial hydrogen bonding interactions. However, the observed change in activity was negligible with either an increase or decrease of one residue in the peptide chain length (compare entries 3, 6 and 7) .",

Several energy minimization processes with an MMFF94x force field were additionally performed in a water soak environment around the inhibitor, followed by a molecular dynamics simulation. During the simulation, the moieties from P 1 to P 3 interacted in a similar manner as the original ligand except for the thiazolyl ketone and benzyloxycarbonyl moieties (Fig. 1a) . The oxoanion of the ketone generated from an attack of Cys145, interacted with the amide backbone of Gly143, Ser144 and Cys145 (Fig. 1b) . The nitrogen in the thiazole was also in contact with His41 through hydrogen bonding interactions. These interactions indicate an acceptance of the unique ketone.
