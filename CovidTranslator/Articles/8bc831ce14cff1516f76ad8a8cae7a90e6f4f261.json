            "text": "Subgenomic RNA transcription of coronaviruses involves the interaction between the leader (or antileader) and the intergenic (IG) sequences. However, it is not clear how these two sequences interact with each other. In this report, a previously unrecognized minor species of subgenomic mRNA, termed mRNA5-1, was identified in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains JHM2c, JHM(2), JHM(3), A59, and MHV-1. Sequence analysis revealed that the leader-body fusion site of the mRNA is located at approximately 150 nucleotides (nt) downstream of the consensus IG sequence for mRNA 5 and did not have sequence homology with any known IG consensus sequences. To determine whether this sequence functions independently as a promoter, we cloned a 140-nt sequence (from \u03f770 nt upstream to \u03f770 nt downstream of the fusion site) from viral genomic RNA and placed it in front of a reporter gene in the defective-interfering (DI) RNA-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vector. Transfection of the reporter RNA into MHV-infected cells resulted in synthesis of a CAT-specific subgenomic mRNA detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The strength of this promoter was similar to that of the IG7 (for mRNA 7) as measured by the CAT activity. Deletion analysis showed that the sequence as few as 13 nt was sufficient to initiate mRNA transcription, while mutations within the 13-nt abolished mRNA transcription. In vitro translation study confirmed that the envelope (E) protein was translated from mRNA5-1, which encodes the open reading frame (ORF) 5b at its 5\u0408-end, indicating that mRNA5-1 is a functional message. Furthermore, when the ORF5b was replaced with the CAT gene and placed in the DI in the context of viral mini-genome, CAT was expressed not only from the first ORF of mRNA5-1 but also from the second and third ORF of mRNA5 and genomic DI RNA, respectively, suggesting that more than one mechanism is involved in regulation of ORF5b expression. Our findings thus support the notion that base-pairing between the leader (or antileader) and the IG is not the sole mechanism in subgenomic RNA transcription.",

            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a prototype of murine coronavirus, contains a single-strand, positive-sense RNA genome of \u03f732 kb in length (Lee et al., 1991; Pachuk et al., 1989) . Upon virus infection into susceptible cells, the viral genomic RNA serves both as an mRNA for translation of the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase polyprotein, which is required for subsequent RNA transcription and replication, and as a template for the synthesis of the genome-length, negative-strand RNA that in turn is used for the synthesis of the viral genome. Six to seven subgenomic mRNAs (mRNAs 2 to 7) are found in MHV-infected cells (Lai et al., 1981; Leibowitz et al., 1981) . They are co-nested at the 3\u0408-ends (Lai et al., 1981; Leibowitz et al., 1981) . Each mRNA contains a leader sequence of approximately 70 nucleotides (nt) at the 5\u0408-end, which is identical to the leader sequence of the genomic RNA (Lai et al., 1983 (Lai et al., , 1984 Spaan et al., 1983) . Depending on MHV strains, there are two to four consensus UCUAA repeats with the last repeat being UCUAAAC, at the 3\u0408-end of the leader (Makino and Lai, 1989a,b) . An identical or similar consensus sequence is present between each gene, termed intergenic (IG) sequence (Budzilowicz et al., 1985; Shieh et al., 1989) , which serves as a transcription initiation signal (promoter) for subgenomic mRNA synthesis (based on the leader-primed transcription model) or a termination signal for subgenomic negative-strand RNA synthesis (based on the discontinuous transcription on the negative-strand RNA) (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, and references therein) . The IG is the cis-acting sequence absolutely required for subgenomic RNA transcription (Makino et al., 1991) ; it serves as a joining point between the leader (or antileader) and the remaining body part of each subgenomic RNA. For simplicity and consistency, we use the terminology according to the leader-primed transcription model (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997 ) throughout this report.",

Further sequencing on cDNA clones derived from JHM2c mRNAs by reserve transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has shown that the leader-body joining sites in subgenomic mRNA2-1 are more heterogeneous . In addition to the varying numbers of repeats, the joining sites of some mRNAs are located either upstream or downstream of the authentic consensus IG sequence, and they appear to be randomly distributed. The degree of such heterogeneity varies among JHM strains and mRNA species. Such phenomenon has also been observed in a recombinant MHV A59 expressing a green fluorescence protein (Fischer et al., 1997) . Two mRNA species smaller than mRNA7 were also identified in MHV-infected cells; they initiate from IG-like sequences UCCAAAC and UCUAAAU, respectively, within the nucleocapsid gene (Schaad and Baric, 1993) . Thus, heterogeneity of leaderbody joining sites in subgenomic mRNAs may be a common phenomenon for MHV.",

Subsequently, the IRES has been roughly mapped through a series of deletion mutants to be located approximately between 100-nt upstream and 180-nt downstream of initiation codon for ORF5b (Jendrach et al., 1999) . The counterparts of the E gene in other coronaviruses include ORF5b of bovine coronavirus (BCoV), ORF4 of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E, and ORF3c of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Godet et al., 1992; Smith et al., 1990; Siddell, 1995) . Interestingly, while ORF5b of BCoV and ORF4 of TGEV and HCoV are translated from the first ORF of mRNA5-1 and mRNA4, respectively, the ORF3c of IBV and ORF5b of MHV are translated from the third and second ORF of mRNA3 and mRNA5, respectively. More intriguingly, within TGEV strains, the ORF3b of Muller strain is translated from the second ORF of mRNA3 via an IRES, whereas that of the Purdue strain is translated from the first ORF of mRNA3-1 via cap-dependent mechanism (O'Connor and Brian, 2000).

Subsequently, the same mRNA species was identified in other MHV strains. We found that the leader-body joining site for this mRNA is located approximately 150-nt downstream rather than the authentic consensus IG sequence for mRNA5. We thus named mRNA5-1 for this novel mRNA species, and accordingly, IG5-1 for this transcription initiation site. When it was placed in front of the chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) gene in the defective-interfering (DI) RNA-CAT reporter plasmid, the IG5-1, which is devoid of any known IRES sequence, can direct the synthesis of a subgenomic CAT-containing mRNA and expression of the CAT activity, thus confirming that the IG5-1 serves as a promoter for transcription of a subgenomic mRNA. Deletion analyses identified that a 13-nt sequence is sufficient for driving the reporter gene transcription. Furthermore, in vitro translation study confirmed that the E protein is translated from mRNA5-1, suggesting that mRNA5-1 is likely a functional message in virus-infected cells.",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that subgenomic mRNA2-1 of a small plaque mutant JHM2c is more heterogeneous in the leader-body joining site than that of its parental JHM strain, and that, even within the same JHM2c strain, mRNA2-1 is more heterogeneous than mRNA7 . To understand whether such heterogeneity is virus-strain specific or mRNA-species specific, we have undertaken systematic analyses on the structure of all subgenomic mRNA species of JHM2c. DBT cells were infected with JHM2c at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5 in the presence of actinomycin D. Intracellular RNAs were extracted from infected cells at 8 h postinfection (p.i.). cDNAs were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain action (RT-PCR) with a sense primer specific to the leader sequence and an antisense primer specific to a sequence downstream of the IG for each subgenomic mRNA. PCR products were directly cloned into the pTOPO2.1 TA vector. Inserts were then released from the vector by digestion with a restriction endonuclease EcoRI and were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. We found that heterogeneity of subgenomic mRNAs occurred in all mRNA species (Fig. 1 , and further data not shown). While it was consistent with the previous finding that the heterogeneity at the leader-body fusion site appeared to be randomly distributed , transcripts amplified from mRNA5-specific primers exhibited another distinct subset. As shown in Fig. 1B , three types of cDNA inserts for mRNA5 were identified. Fourteen of the 20 clones analyzed had a size corresponding to mRNAs initiating at the authentic consensus IG5 site. One had a size larger than the authentic mRNA5. Surprisingly, a quarter (5/20) of clones had a size smaller than the authentic mRNA5, suggesting that these transcripts possibly initiated at a downstream sequence. These results indicate that mRNA 5 of JHM2c is also heterogeneous, but that a second initiation site might be present at a downstream location.",

To confirm that the cDNA clones shown in Fig. 1 indeed represent mRNA5, and if so, what are the structural feature of these clones at the leader-body joining sites, all 20 clones were sequenced with an automated DNA sequencer. As shown in Fig. 2A , all 20 clones contained sequences corresponding to mRNA5 of JHM2c, indicating the specificity of the RT-PCR products. Consistent with the data from agarose gel analysis ( Fig. 1) , the leaders of the 14 clones fused to the body at the authentic consensus IG sequence (UCUAAAC) ( Fig.  2A) . In one clone, the leader fused to a sequence upstream of the consensus IG sequence. This clone was not pursued for further experiments due to its singularity. All the other five smaller clones had a leader fused to a nonconsensus sequence approximately 150-nt down-stream of the authentic consensus IG sequence, with only three nucleotides complementary to the template (Figs. 2A and 2B). These sequence data indicate that the noncanonical downstream sequence possibly serves as a site for leader-fusion for a smaller subgenomic mRNA species, which is termed mRNA5-1.",

Two rounds of PCR for a total of 65 cycles were performed. The PCR fragments of \u03f7600 nt in length were gel-purified and used for direct sequencing. As shown in Figs. 2C-2F, the DNA fragments of the four MHV strains contain the same leader-body junction site that is identical to that of the IG5-1 of JHM2c (see Fig.  2B ). These results thus confirm the existence of mRNA5-1 in all five MHV strains studied that uses the downstream IG5-1 sequence as the leader-fusion site. It is worth noting that minor species of mRNAs other than mRNA5-1 might exist, which could not be identified by direct sequencing of PCR fragments.",

The ability of the deleted sequences in initiating subgenomic mRNA transcription was then determined by both the expression of CAT activity and the synthesis of CAT-containing subgenomic mRNAs. As shown in Fig. 4A , when an upstream 63-nt sequence was deleted, the CAT activity was similar to that of the fulllength [compare DECAT5-1(140) with DECAT5-1\u232c63]. However, when an additional 13-nt sequence was deleted, the CAT activity was significantly reduced to approximately 12-fold above the background (more than 100-fold reduction) [compare DECAT5-1\u232c76 with DECAT5-1\u232c63 in Fig. 4A ). When a construct containing only a 13-nt sequence franking the leader-fusion site was transfected [construct DECAT5-1(13)], 95% of the CAT activity was expressed as compared to the full-length [DECAT5-1(140)], indicating that the 13-nt sequence is sufficient for driving CAT expression. Consistent with the results of CAT activity, subgenomic mRNAs corresponding to the respective constructs were identified by RT-PCR in MHV-infected and DI-transfected cells (Fig. 4B) .

Subgenomic mRNA5-1 is a functional message for translation of the E protein in an in vitro translation system. To determine whether mRNA 5-1 is a functional message, the open reading frame prediction program of software MacVector (version 3.5) was used to analyze the sequence and to predict the possible ORFs in mRNA5-1. Our analysis indicated that ORF5b is the most probable ORF at the 5\u0408-end of mRNA5-1 (Fig. 5A ). To confirm that ORF5b can be expressed from mRNA5-1, a FIG. 3.

To address this question, we made two sets of DI CAT reporter constructs, both of which contain the authentic ORF5a and the CAT gene in place of ORF5b. In the first set, the IG5 consensus sequence and the 5\u0408-UTR are present, so that ORF5a would be expressed from mRNA5, while in the second set the ORF5a would not be expressed due to the absence of mRNA5 transcription (see their structures in Fig. 6 ). We then transfected these DI RNAs into JHM-infected cells. Detection of the CAT activity would indicate the expression of the ORF5b from these reporter DI RNAs. As expected, high CAT activity was detected in DECAT5-RNA-transfected cells (1384fold increase over the background) (Fig. 6A) . Interestingly, the CAT activity expressed from DECAT5m RNAtransfected cells remained at a high level (921-fold above background level), though it was slightly lower than that of DECAT5. Because there was no subgenomic DI mRNA5-1 transcribed from DECAT5m (Fig. 6B) , it is conceivable that the CAT activity must have been expressed CAT activities expressed from these constructs, shown on the right, represent fold-increase against the background, which is set as onefold (1\u03eb). The CAT activities are representative of three independent experiments. IG5 and IG5-1 indicate the transcription initiation sites for mRNA5 and mRNA5-1, respectively. IG5-1m indicates two nucleotide mutations in the IG5-1 sequence. ORF, DI open reading frame. Thick lines denote the sequences derived from the viral genome; dashed lines indicate deletions. (B) Reverse-transcription PCR was performed to detect CAT-containing subgenomic mRNAs using CAT-and leaderspecific primers. RNAs were isolated from cells infected with a helper MHV and transfected with various DI CAT RNAs as indicated at the top. Lane Mock-Tx, mock-transfection. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. The solid arrow denotes PCR products representing mRNAs transcribed from IG5 site, and the unfilled arrow indicates mRNAs transcribed from IG5-1 site. M, molecular mass marker in base pair (bp) is shown on the left. from either DI mRNA5 or genomic DI RNA, in the latter of which the CAT gene is the third ORF. In both cases, the expression of the CAT activity must be mediated via internal entry of ribosome. When the IG5 consensus sequence was removed and the TIS5-1 was mutated (construct DECAT5-1Lm), the CAT activity was drastically reduced (164-fold above the background). Because neither DI mRNA5 nor DI mRNA5-1 was transcribed from DECAT5-1Lm (Fig. 6B) , the low level of CAT activity was likely expressed from the genomic DI RNA via ribosomal internal entry. However, when the wild-type IG5-1 sequence was restored (DECAT5-1L), CAT activity was significantly increased (Fig. 6A) . Because the wild-type IG5-1 allowed the transcription of DI mRNA5-1 (Fig. 6B) , this result indicates that a large part of the CAT activity was expressed from DI mRNA5-1 (compare the structure and CAT activity of DECAT5-1L with those of DECAT5-1Lm in Fig. 6 ). Taken together, these results indicate that MHV ORF5b can be expressed from mRNA5, mRNA5-1, and even the genomic RNA in vivo using the DI RNA expression system.",

            "text": "In this study, we have identified a noncanonical sequence that allows the transcription of a novel subgenomic mRNA species (mRNA5-1) of JHM2c, JHM(2), JHM(3), A59, and MHV-1. Using the MHV DI RNA-CAT reporter system, we were able to demonstrate that the noncanonical sequence serves as a signal for transcription of a subgenomic mRNA (Fig. 3) . Although the precise sequence for this transcription signal was not determined, a 13-nt sequence including the leader-joining site was shown to be sufficient for the expression of the DI CAT reporter gene (Fig. 4) . Furthermore, the three nucleotides at the leader-joining site appear to be required for its transcription activity, since mutations of these nucleotides abolished subgenomic mRNA transcription (Fig.  4) . The computer program MacVector predicts that this novel mRNA species encodes the ORF5b of MHV at its most 5\u0408-end. In vitro translation studies with the rabbit reticulocyte lysate confirmed that the E protein is translated from this mRNA (Fig. 5) , indicating that this mRNA is a functional transcript. Our results thus establish for the first time that a noncanonical sequence, which has no sequence resemblance to the consensus IG sequence, can serve as a signal for transcription of a functional mRNA in MHV. This finding will have important implications not only in the mechanisms of coronavirus RNA transcription but also in the regulation of coronavirus gene expression both at the transcription and translation levels.",

            "text": "The major feature in coronavirus RNA transcription is the discontinuous process. Regardless of whether the discontinuous transcription occurs during (\u03e9)-or (\u03ea)strand synthesis, subgenomic RNA synthesis always in-volves the interaction between the leader (antileader) and the intergenic sequence. It has been suggested that this interaction is probably mediated by direct RNA-RNA interaction between the complementary sequences (see review by Lai and Cavanagh, 1997 , and references therein). Using MHV JHM2c, we previously showed that mRNA2-1 of JHM2c is very heterogeneous at its leaderbody joining site . In addition to those mRNAs whose leader-body fusion occurs at the consensus IG sequence, some mRNAs have a leader fused at either upstream or downstream of the consensus IG sequence. Because these upstream or downstream regions do not have complementary sequences between the leader and the consensus IG site, it is less likely that direct RNA-RNA interaction through complementary sequences is the major determinant for this discontinuous process. While the previous observation reveals a random fashion of the heterogeneous leaderbody fusion sites, our present data show a distinct, conserved site, even though both studies have identified noncanonical sequences for leader-body fusion. Thus, our current finding reinforces the notion that direct RNA-RNA base-pairing between the leader (antileader) and the IG region is not the sole mechanism in regulating coronavirus RNA transcription. If base-pairing guides subgenomic RNA transcription as shown in arterivirus (van Marle et al., 1999) , then why the remaining consensus sequences that are base-paired with the leader and are distributed throughout the genomes of arteriviruses and coronaviruses do not transcribe subgenomic mRNAs. This fact combined with previous Fischer et al., 1997) and current findings further suggests that other mechanisms, i.e., protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions and/or RNA secondary structures Zhang and Lai, 1995; Lai, 1998) , are likely involved in this discontinuous transcription process.",

            "text": "With respect to the translation of ORF5b, our data clearly show that, when the ORF was placed at the 5\u0408-most end of an mRNA (pBS-mRNA5-1), it could be translated efficiently both in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation system (construct pBS-mRNA5-1 in Fig. 5 ) and in vivo in the DI RNA CAT-reporter system (construct DECAT-5-1L in Fig. 6) . These data suggest that ORF5b is possibly expressed from mRNA5-1 via the 5\u0408 cap-dependent mechanism. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of the cap-independent pathway because part of the IRES (Jendrach et al., 1999) is also present in these mRNAs. When the CAT gene was placed in the second ORF of mRNA5 (construct DECAT5m in Fig. 6 ) or in the third ORF of genomic DI RNA (construct DECAT5-1Lm in Fig. 6) , the CAT gene could also be expressed in vivo with the DI CAT-reporter system. These results thus clearly indicate that ORF5b can be expressed via internal ribosomal entry, consistent with the finding by Siddell (1994, 1995) . Jen-drach et al. (1999) reported that the IRES encompassing a region from approximately 100-nt upstream to 180-nt downstream of the ORF5b AUG start codon mediated the translation of ORF5b. Our results showed that the presence of the upstream sequence alone is able to mediate its expression, albeit with low efficiency (Fig. 6) . It is important to point out that, although our experimental design was not intended to address the mechanism of translation, the results presented here (Fig. 6 ) strongly suggest that ORF5b can be expressed from mRNA5, mRNA5-1, and genomic RNA. This finding raises an intriguing question: Why does MHV use multiple pathways to regulate the expression of a single gene? To date, there is no clear answer to this question, but it is known that the expression of the E protein is diverse. For example, the E gene is expressed from the third ORF of mRNA3 in IBV, but from the first ORF of mRNA5-1 of BCoV and of mRNA4 of TGEV and HCoV 229E (Siddell, 1995) . Apparently, various coronaviruses have the ability to use different mechanisms for expressing their E protein. Recently, O'Connor and Brian (2000) reported that in TGEV, ORF3b of the Purdue strain is expressed from the first ORF of mRNA3-1, whereas that of the Muller strain is expressed from the second ORF of mRNA3.",

When the CAT gene was placed as the third ORF in the DI, a low level of CAT activity was expressed (Fig. 6A) . One possible explanation is that a low amount of CAT-containing subgenomic DI RNA was transcribed from the mutated IG5-1 site. However, our sensitive RT-PCR could not detect any such mRNA (Fig.  6B) . Thus, a more reasonable explanation is that the CAT activity is expressed from the genomic RNA via internal entry of ribosome. This is further supported by the data obtained with the DECAT5m construct. However, by comparing DECAT5-1L with DECAT5-1Lm (Fig. 6) , one could conclude that translation of the CAT gene from the genomic DI RNA via internal entry of ribosome must be very inefficient. By analogy to the DI system, our results suggest that the E gene can also be expressed from the genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNAs 2-4, since they all contain the IRES, but that the efficiency of such translation is low. Further investigation on the mechanisms of translation of ORF5b is needed.",

            "text": "It is worth noting that the detection of mRNA5-1 in JHM2c-infected cells is unlikely the result of RT-PCR artifact. We employed the same procedure for amplifying various mRNA species (mRNAs 2-7) and did not identify such conserved mRNA species (Zhang, 2000) . By contrast, we were able to amplify mRNA5-1 repeatedly and in an amount proportional to mRNA5 (data not shown). However, mRNA5-1 is a minor species relative to mRNA5 (Figs. 1 and 2) . Interestingly, when Makino et al. (1984) analyzed the intracellular viral mRNAs of JHM2c and its parental JHM strains, they found that a minor mRNA species (named RNA c) migrated slightly faster than mRNA5 on 1% agarose gel. They noted that it was difficult to separate the major (mRNA5) from the minor (RNA c) RNA species, but possible mixtures were noticeable. Although RNA c was identified in both JHM and JHM2c, it was predominantly present in JHM2c (Makino et al., 1984) . Sequence comparison also revealed that the IG5-1 is conserved between JHM and JHM2c (data not shown). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that mRNA5-1 identified in this study might represent RNA c detected by Makino et al. (1984) . However, RNA c-like mRNA species was not found in A59 and MHV-1. Thus, mRNA5-1 may represent a novel mRNA species.",

For detection of viral subgenomic mRNAs, DBT cells were infected with JHM2c at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Virus grew in the presence of actinomycin D (10 g/ml). Intracellular RNAs were isolated from cells at 7 h postinfection by the Nonidet P-40 method as described previously and used for cDNA synthesis by RT with an antisense primer 3\u0408IG5-300 (5\u0408-GCG TAG GCC GTG AAG CTA-3\u0408). This primer is complementary to a sequence approximately 300 nucleotides downstream of the IG consensus sequence between genes 6 and 5 of viral RNAs. An additional sense primer (5\u0408L9) specific to the leader was used for the subsequent PCR amplification. The conditions for the RT-PCR were essentially the same as described previously . Briefly, the RT reaction was carried out at 42\u00b0C for 90 min, and the PCR was performed in a thermocycler (DNA Engine PTC-200, M.J. Research) for 30 cycles. The condition for each cycle was denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 62\u00b0C for 1 min, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min. For detection of subgenomic mRNAs containing the CAT reporter gene, RT-PCR was carried out using a CAT-specific antisense primer 3\u0408-CAT542 (5\u0408-TTA CGC CCC GCC CTG CCA CTC ATC GC-3\u0408, complementary to the 3\u0408-end of the CAT ORF) and the leader-specific sense primer 5\u0408-L9. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis either directly or after cloning and restriction enzyme digestion as indicated. PCR products were directly cloned into the pTOPO2.1 TA cloning vector (In Vitrogen). For detecting mRNA5-1 in other MHV strains [JHM(2), JHM(3), A59 and MHV-1], the antisense primer 3\u0408-IG6-50 (5\u0408-GCT GTC CAT TGG TAG ACG-3\u0408, complementary to a sequence at nt 30-47 of the ORF6) was used for RT reaction and the primer pair 5\u0408-L9 and 3\u0408-IG6-50 for PCR.",

In the first PCR, pTA-IG5-370 DNA was used as a template. pTA-IG5-370 contains the 5\u0408-end 370 nt of mRNA5, which was cloned after RT-PCR amplification (see Figs. 1 and 2). The sense primer was 5\u0408-SpeIG5-1 (5\u0408-TTA CTA GTT GTG AGT GAC GCC T-3\u0408), which contains a SpeI site at the 5\u0408-end (italic) and a sequence at nt 81-95 downstream of the consensus IG5 site. The antisense primer was 3\u0408-IG5-1 CAT (5\u0408-ATT TTT TTC TCC ATA CCC TGG TTG CTA CA-3\u0408), which contains a sequence from nt 206 to 221 downstream of the consensus IG5 and the first 14 nt of the CAT ORF (italic). In the second PCR, the CAT ORF was amplified from the pDECAT2-1 DNA template with the primer pair 5\u0408-CAT (5\u0408-ATG GAG AAA AAA AT-3\u0408) and 3\u0408CAT542.

The final PCR products were digested with SpeI and BspEI, and they were directionally cloned into the SpeI and BspEI sites of pDECAT2-1, generating pDECAT5-1(140). This construct contains 140 nt of the IG5-1 sequence in front of the CAT ORF. For making two deletion constructs, pDECAT5-1(140) was used as a template for PCR amplification with the primer pair 5\u0408-SpeIG5-1\u232c63 and 3\u0408CAT542, and 5\u0408-SpeIG5-1\u232c76 and 3\u0408CAT542, respectively. 5\u0408-SpeIG5-1\u232c63 (5\u0408-TTA CTA GTG CTT CCA ATT TAA-3\u0408) contains a SpeI site (italic) and a sequence at nt 144-156 downstream of the IG5 consensus sequence. 5\u0408-SpeIG5-1\u232c76 (5\u0408-TTA CTA GTT ATT GCC AAC CCC GA-3\u0408) contain a SpeI site at the 5\u0408-end (italic), and a sequence at nt 157-172 downstream of IG5 consensus sequence. The PCR products were digested with SpeI and BspEI, and directionally cloned into the SpeI and BspEI sites of pDECAT2-1, resulting in pDECAT5-1\u232c63 and pDECAT5-1\u232c76, respectively (Fig.  4) .

The in vitro translation experiment was performed in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of 35 S-methionine. Ten microliters of in vitro translation products were precipitated with an anti-E antibody (lane IVT \u03e9 \u2423E) or with an unrelated anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (lane IVT \u03e9 \u2423Flag) or without any antibody (lane IVT \u03e9 G). Lane IVT represents 10% of the input volume of in vitro translation products used for immunoprecipitation. Proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis on 17% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The arrow indicates the E protein. Prestained protein standard (Bio-Rad) was used as molecular mass marker, which is shown in kilodaltons (kDa) on the left.",
