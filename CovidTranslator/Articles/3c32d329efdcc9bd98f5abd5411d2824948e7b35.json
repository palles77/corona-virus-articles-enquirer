Celiac disease Celiac disease (CD), also known as celiac sprue, nontropical sprue, gluten-induced enteropathy, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE), is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the small intestine induced by a T-cell-mediated immune response and characterized by malabsorption after ingestion of wheat gluten or related proteins in rye (secalins) and barley (hordeins) in individuals with a certain genetic background. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) CVID is primarily a dysfunction of B-cell differentiation resulting in hypogammaglobulinemia and diminished ability to produce antibodies. Deamidation Detachment of an amino group by tissue transglutaminase from gliadin that becomes negatively charged. Enteroendocrine cell dysgenesis This disorder is associated with neurogenin 3 mutation that is a protein involved in gut and pancreatic endocrine cell development, located on chromosome 10q21.3. Enteropathy-induced T-cell lymphoma (EITCL) This highgrade T-cell lymphoma is the most fearsome complication of CD in patients with long-standing malabsorption. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis This is a spectrum of diseases characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of various segments of the GI tract together with peripheral eosinophilia and coexisting allergies. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) Donor T cells of cytotoxic subtype incite an immunologic reaction to certain host cells resulting in injury to GI mucosa. Gastrointestinal complications are common in bone marrow transplant recipients rather than solid organ transplantation.

Microvillus inclusion disease (MVID) MVID is an uncommon congenital enteropathy characterized by severe, intractable diarrhea within the first week of life due to defective MYO5B gene located on 18q21 encoding myosin Vb that regulates distribution of endosomes. It is characterized by loss of microvilli and numerous microvillus inclusions in the apical cytoplasm of the enterocytes. Neonatal enteropathy Severe intractable chronic (> 2-3 weeks) diarrhea starting immediately after birth and resulting in failure to thrive of the infant.

Adequate absorption takes place when there are mechanically intact digestive organs to produce the necessary enzymes as well as an adequate blood supply, motility, and microflora. Malabsorption develops when malfunction in any of these components leads to failure of absorption of nutrients resulting from a wide variety of causes ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ), the mechanisms of which can be classified into three groups: (i) maldigestion, which is related to mixing and digestive mediators; (ii) mucosal or mural causes including celiac disease (CD); and (iii) microbial causes (Table 2) . Physiologically, there are three phases of absorption, luminal digestion, mucosal digestion, and mucosal absorption. The luminal phase consists of the breakdown of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats by digestive enzymes and bile, while mucosal phase involves hydrolysis of carbohydrates and peptides by enzymes of enterocyte membrane (disaccharidases and peptidases), and absorption phase comprises transepithelial transport of nutrients, fluid, and electrolytes to the blood vessels through enterocytes. Malabsorption can, therefore, result from defects in either of these phases. In the succeeding text, the mechanisms of malabsorption are further discussed for each of these phases:",

Small intestinal biopsy is an indispensable component of the diagnostic work-up of patients with malabsorption and/or chronic diarrhea secondary to mucosal damage. Though complete villous flattening usually indicates CD when coexisting crypt hyperplasia is present, there are entities that may cause villous flattening and crypt hyperplasia other than CD. The majority of disorders causing malabsorption, on the other hand, produce mild to moderate villus blunting and crypt hyperplasia without any specific diagnostic feature.

Further mechanical digestion continues in the stomach until the semiliquid food or chyme is formed. Digestion is completed when chyme is delivered into the duodenum and treated with pancreatic enzymes and bile salts. When normal gastric function is lost due to surgical procedures such as partial or total gastrectomy, the partially digested food rapidly passes into the duodenum causing osmotic pressure and diarrhea. Enzymatic activity is equally crucial for absorption of nutrients. Pancreatic enzymes and intestinal brush border hydrolases act in harmony for chemical modification of complex carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Therefore, any disorder causing defective nutrient hydrolysis as in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) where excess HCl (acid) production may inactivate gastric lipase and proteolytic pancreatic exocrine enzymes, pancreatic enzyme deficiency due to chronic pancreatitis, or a malignancy obstructing the outflow of pancreatic juices into the duodenum may all lead to malabsorption. There are reduced bile salt synthesis due to severe liver disease (cirrhosis) and impaired bile salt secretion due to chronic cholestasis (intrinsic liver disease that causes bile duct damage or extrahepatic bile duct obstruction): bile salts are thus not available to form micelles to aid in fat solubilization for absorption. Bile salts may be inactivated in the intestinal lumen by overgrowth of bacteria in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome (SIBO). In patients with conditions that predispose to intestinal stasis, either by anatomical or motility abnormalities bacteria may overgrow in the proximal small intestine ( Figure 3 ). These excess bacteria deconjugate bile salts leaving them unconjugated and unable to participate in micelle formation. This leads to malabsorption of fat and fatsoluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.",

When gluten is presented to lamina propria CD4 \u00fe helper T cells, they become activated to secrete INF gamma and induce upregulation of IL15 that in turn boosts IEL-mediated cytotoxicity. IELs, under the influence of IL15, gain NK-cell-like properties and cause enterocyte damage ( Figure 5 ). Tissue damage leads to tTG secretion and deamidation of more gluten peptides. Because of the immunopathologic basis of the disease, there is a complex and heterogeneous population of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria comprising plasma cells that locally produce antigliadin antibodies and antiendomysial antibodies, T cells that include predominantly helper T cells as well as few cytotoxic cells. Also, neutrophils, eosinophils, and mast cells may be found in varying numbers, though grading this inflammatory reaction is difficult and impractical.

Gluten sensitivity has also been known to affect other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, (1) Normal absorption of carbohydrates with intact brush border hydrolase activity. Lactase acts upon luminal lactose and cleaves it to glucose and galactose that can then be absorbed by the intestines. (2) In lactase deficiency, this cleavage cannot take place leaving lactose intact until it reaches the colon where fermentation by intestinal microflora occurs resulting in gas formation.

Marsh classification is comprised of three consecutive states of mucosal damage (types 1-3), including infiltrative lesion (Marsh type 1) characterized by increased IELs in the villus epithelium in an otherwise normal mucosa with normal villous-crypt ratio, hyperplastic lesion (Marsh type 2) characterized by crypt hyperplasia with normal villi showing increased IELs, and destructive lesion (Marsh type 3) characterized by flat mucosa with crypt hyperplasia and increased IEL ( Figure 6 ). In its classical form, CD results in shortened, widened villi or even totally flat mucosa with hyperplastic crypts (Figure 7(a) and 7(b)). These architectural changes are preceded by an increase in the number of IELs over the normal numbers (Figure 8 (a) and 8(b)), corresponding to the cell-mediated immune nature of the disorder, and it is this group of cases that cause difficulty in the differential diagnosis.",

The mechanism is believed to be mediated through activation of Th2 lymphocytes leading to an increased production of proallergenic interleukins, especially, IL-4, IL-5, and IL13. While IL-5 promotes maturation of eosinophils and migration from the bone marrow into the circulating bloodstream, IL-4 and IL-13 upregulate the production of eotaxin-3 by the epithelium, a chemokine responsible for attracting the eosinophils into the mucosa ( Figure 11) . As a result, mature eosinophils accumulate in the intestine, are activated, and degranulate releasing multiple cytotoxic agents. Though the mechanism of fibrogenesis is still unclear, IL-5, by inducing fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation, may be the critical molecule for tissue fibrosis as well as smooth muscle hyperplasia that leads to defective peristaltism and malabsorption in this condition. Histological abnormalities consist of mild to severe eosinophilic infiltrates in the lamina propria and intraepithelial eosinophils both in the surface and crypt epithelium, forming eosinophilic crypt abscesses, and in the muscularis mucosae together with mildly increased IELs (Figure 12(a) and 12(b) ).",

The disease was first described by Davidson et al. in 1978 as severe secretory diarrhea occurring during the first week of life with villous atrophy in the intestinal biopsy. It has been demonstrated that MYO5B gene located on 18q21 encoding myosin Vb that regulates the organization of intracellular transport and cell surface polarity in epithelial cells. Myosin Vb-deficient enterocytes display disruption of cell polarity as reflected by mislocalized apical and basolateral transporter proteins including CD36, altered distribution of certain endosomal/lysosomal constituents including Rab GTPases, and disorganization in the distribution of actin myofilaments ( Figure 13) . Although described as a disease of the small intestine, there are few reports of colonic involvement. Successful outcomes of small intestinal transplantation have been reported, and evidence suggests that an early transplant might be beneficial. Diagnosis rests on light and electron microscopic examination of small intestinal biopsy. Duodenal biopsies show moderate villous blunting, with no active inflammation in the lamina propria or IELosis. Changes in the enterocytes are typically found at the villous tips rather than villous bases and crypts. Light microscopy shows an irregular vacuolated appearance in the apical cytoplasm of the enterocytes with extensive or patchy absence of the brush border (Figure 14(a) and 14(b) ). The surface epithelial brush border shows an abnormal pattern of staining by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and CD10 instead of its normal linear staining pattern. Ultrastructural examination revealing intracytoplasmic inclusions that are lined by intact microvilli is the diagnostic hallmark of the disease (Figure 14(c) ). These inclusions are present in the absorptive surface epithelial cells of the small intestine and are associated with poorly developed surface brush border microvilli.",

The general pathogenetic mechanism shared by many small intestinal infections depends on the interaction of the infectious agent with the mucosal components including the enterocytes and the immune modulators and effector cells in the lamina propria. This interaction requires an intact mucosa with intact enterocytes as well as an intact innate and adaptive intestinal immune system. The way that intestinal immune system recognizes pathogens from nutrients and microflora residents is via the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These pattern recognition receptors include Toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors that sense extracellular and intracellular PAMPs, respectively. They are specifically expressed in response to certain microbial stimuli, especially to invasive microorganisms. The immune effectors or modulators, on the other hand, are products of distinct genes, which may be either constitutively expressed (i.e., alpha defensins) or inducible (i.e., beta defensins) molecules by infectious stimuli.",

In addition, many patients with irritable bowel syndrome may suffer from this condition. Normally, small intestinal lumen is colonized by facultative anaerobe or obligate bacteria, particularly bacteroides species, which are most abundant in the distal ileum. Any disbalance of this complex intestinal microbiome, both qualitative and quantitative, might have serious health consequences resulting in SIBO.

Small bowel aspirate and quantitative cultures with more than 10 5 CFU ml \u00c01 considered the cutoff are the diagnostic procedures. The resultant picture involves deconjugation of bile acids by bacterial enzymes causing loss of deconjugated bile acids in stool and decreased bile acid pool that is not enough for lipid digestion/absorption.

Infection occurs by fecaloral transmission, contaminated food and water, and personto-person transmission. A number of studies have found that children and patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, agammaglobulinemia, IgA deficiency, and/or achlorhydria have a higher incidence of infection with Giardia. However, a humoral immunodeficiency state is not necessary for infection. Immunosuppressed patients are more likely to have long-term infections with chronic diarrhea and malabsorption, while immunocompetent patients are more likely to have an acute self-limited diarrheal illness or become asymptomatic carriers. In its classical picture, diarrhea, abdominal pain, boating, nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, and weight loss are the main presenting symptoms. Giardia exists in two forms: the motile trophozoite and the infective cyst. Following ingestion, the cyst forms two trophozoites in the duodenum. These are pearshaped with two nuclei or sickle-shaped in sagittal plane appearing faintly basophilic on H&E sections. Trophozoites are typically found in the lumen near the surface or as attached to the enterocytes (Figure 20 (a) and 20(b)). Giardiasis is a typical example of enteric infection that presents with normal or near-normal mucosa, although more severe change in the villous morphology resembling CD may rarely be seen. In children, giardiasis can cause lymphoid hyperplasia in the small intestinal mucosa. Coccidial infections are commonly observed in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with AIDS. However, all except microsporidia may also infect healthy individual and cause diarrhea accompanied by fever, weight loss, and abdominal pain. The immunocompromised patients may suffer from malabsorption. Among the most common coccidial organisms infecting the small bowel are Cryptosporidium parvum, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Isospora belli, Microsporidium, cryptosporidia, microsporidia, and I. belli are often missed, because of their small size, intracellular location, and poor staining with usual tissue stains thereby require special stains.

Infection with Ancylostoma duodenale, a hookworm, causes chronic blood loss and malabsorption and bloody diarrhea leading to iron deficiency anemia. Patients often have peripheral eosinophilia with mucosal eosinophilic infiltrates. Mucosal ulcerations are common when there is heavy parasitic infection. Strongyloides stercoralis also causes malabsorption, diarrhea, and eosinophilia. The intestinal surface is hemorrhagic and eroded covered with a pseudomembrane of exudate and fibrin. Larvae, adult forms, and eggs may all be present within the crypts (Figure 23 ). Fasciolopsis buski inhabits the upper small intestine. The infection is usually asymptomatic unless there is heavy parasitic infection. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, and GI hemorrhage. Large adult parasites attach to the intestinal mucosa inciting an inflammatory reaction.",

            "text": "Biopsies from patients with enteric viral infections seldom if ever cross the stage of the surgical pathologist, as they are detected in stool samples rather than biopsy specimens. Some common enteric viruses known to cause diarrhea include, adenovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, echovirus, enterovirus, astrovirus, and Norwalk virus. Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe childhood diarrhea and diarrheal mortality worldwide, particularly in children under the age of 2 years. Patients develop fever, severe watery diarrhea, and vomiting leading to dehydration and acidosis. Biopsy changes are very nonspecific and include increased inflammatory cells in the lamina propria, degenerative epithelial changes, and widening of villous tips. The diagnosis of rotavirus is generally made by stool immunoassay and/or culture, and the disease is rarely biopsied. Adenovirus infection is also frequent as a cause of childhood diarrhea. However, it may also cause diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, especially those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS. Histological features of adenovirus infection include epithelial cellular changes such as loss of maturation, disorganization, and degeneration. Characteristic inclusions usually crescent-shaped may be seen, especially in immunocompromised patients, within the nuclei of surface epithelium (particularly goblet cells). Useful aids to diagnosis of adenovirus infection include immunohistochemistry, stool examination by electron microscopy, and viral culture. Pathologists usually get a specimen from adenovirusinfected patients when the patient develops intussusception. CMV infection may be diagnosed in patients with immunosuppression or IBD even when the patients have not been treated with steroids. It is particularly important to consider this diagnosis in patients with steroid-resistant disease as treating the CMV may prevent the need for other medical therapy or surgery. Symptoms may vary with the immune status of the patients and the site of the infection. Most commonly abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and weight loss are observed, while isolated CMV infection of the duodenum may lead to severe GI bleeding. It usually causes ulceration of the mucosa and the viral inclusions are frequently found at the ulcer base. The characteristic owl's eye inclusions are preferentially found in endothelial cells and stromal cells but only rarely in enterocytes (Figure 24(a)-24(c) ). Though H&E sections are diagnostic, immunohistochemistry may be applied when in doubt. CMV infection may mimic IBD both clinically and histologically.",

Gastrointestinal complications of HIV infection have dramatically decreased after the introduction of HAART protocols. However, the effects of antiviral drugs on the GI tract together with superimposed infections are still commonly seen in these patients, especially in those with sustained low levels of CD4 \u00fe T-cell counts. Also, these patients may have atypical presentations of opportunistic infections that occur during or after therapy. Hence, a CD4 count <200 cells mm \u00c03 is the marker for those patients who should be searched for opportunistic infections for their GI symptoms. Histological features of 'HIV enteropathy' include crypt hypertrophy, increased apoptosis in the enterocytes, and villous atrophy that are reminiscent of GVHD.
