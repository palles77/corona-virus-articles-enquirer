We have previously shown that transplantation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) into mice persistently infected with the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) results in enhanced differentiation into oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) that is associated with remyelination and axonal sparing. The current study examines the contributions of the transcription factor Olig1 on NPC differentiation and remyelination. Under defined conditions, NPCs preferentially differentiate into oligodendroglia whereas NPCs isolated from Olig1-deficient (Olig1\u2212/\u2212) mice exhibit enhanced differentiation into astrocytes. Transplantation of Olig1\u2212/\u2212 and Olig1+/+ NPCs into JHMVinfected mice resulted in similar cell survival, proliferation, and selective migration to areas of demyelination. However, only recipients of wild type NPCs exhibited extensive remyelination compared to mice receiving Olig1\u2212/\u2212 NPCs. In vivo characterization of NPCs revealed that Olig1+/+ NPCs preferentially differentiated into NG2-positive OPCs and formed processes expressing myelin basic protein that encircled axons. In contrast, the majority of transplanted Olig1\u2212/\u2212 NPCs differentiated into GFAP-positive cells consistent with the astrocyte lineage.",

Such failure in myelin regeneration could be due to multiple factors including inflammation, inhibitor molecules present in the lesion or age-related deficits in endogenous OPCs (Fancy, et al., 2010) . With this in mind, cell-based therapy using exogenous NPCs or OPCs have emerged as candidate therapies for promoting remyelination (Pluchino, et al., 2009 , Sher, et al., 2008 . Most studies have utilized either autoimmune models of neuroinflammatory-mediated demyelination, or chemical-induced gliotoxic demyelination to assess the remyelination potential of NPCs. While such models have advantages in capturing certain aspects of MS-like pathogenesis, they do not capture the full range of possible causative factors.",

(7 and 21 days post-transplant) and tissue was fixed by intracardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). Intact spinal columns were removed and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C. The bone was removed to expose the fixed spinal cord and the tissue 8 mm anterior and 8mm posterior from the injection site was divided into twelve tissue pieces (1mm). To evaluate GFP+ NPC migration and differentiation in vivo, tissue sections were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 7 days and embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek). Seven-micron thick transverse sections were cut and used for immunofluorescence staining or stained with luxol fast blue (LFB) in combination with H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) to determine the extent of demyelination. To evaluate the remyelination potential of transplanted NPC, even tissue pieces were processed and embedded in resin while odd tissue pieces were processed and embedded in OCT. For resin sectioning, tissue pieces were exposed to 1% Osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences), dehydrated in ascending alcohols, and embedded in Spurr resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) according to standard protocols. Transverse semi-thin (1 \u03bcm) sections were cut from each block, stained with alkaline toluidine blue, cover slipped, and examined by light microscopy using an Olympus BX-60 microscope, 600x magnification. The myelination of axons was determined by assessing the thickness of the myelin sheath in relation to the axons diameter (Guy, et al., 1989, Hildebrand and Hahn, 1978) . Demyelinated axons, remyelinated axons and normally myelinated axons were counted within an area equal to 10% of the total area of demyelination. The quantitative assessment of remyelination was conducted throughout the region 8mm caudal and rostral to the transplant site. The number demyelinated axons, remyelinated axons, the total number of axons and the percent remyelinated axons was determined for each of the four regions on each tissue block, averaged, then averaged across animals within each group for each tissue block as previously described (Totoiu, et al., 2004) .",

NPC cultured from GFP-C57BL/6 mice were used as WT controls. Two weeks prior to transplantation, recipient C57BL/6 mice were infected by i.c. injection of 200 PFU of JHMV, which is a sufficient viral dose to induce immunemediated demyelination. Transplantation consisted of a single intraspinal injection of 2.5x10 5 cells (or vehicle control, HBSS) at thoracic vertebrae 9 and recipient animals were sacrificed one week and three weeks post-transplant to evaluate the extent of exogenous cell migration and engraftment. Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining of a representative JHMVinfected mouse 14 days p.i. indicated that at the time of transplantation, white matter demyelination was localized in the ventral white matter in the vicinity of the central canal ( Figure 2A ). Three weeks post-transplant of either WT or Olig1\u2212/\u2212 NPCs, demyelinated lesions were found to extend from the ventral to the lateral white matter (Figure 2A ). Quantification of demyelination in experimental mice indicated a similar level of myelin damage in recipients of either WT or Olig1\u2212/\u2212 NPCs compared to vehicle control ( Figure   2B ). Importantly, these findings are consistent with earlier results and indicate that transplantation of NPCs neither exacerbate nor ameliorate JHMV-induced immunopathology and this was associated with no attenuation in neuroinflammation (Hardison, et al., 2006 , Totoiu, et al., 2004 .",

Moreover, we have determined that migration is mediated through CXCR4 expressed on transplanted NPCs responding to CXCL12 that is expressed within demyelinating lesions . Transplanted WT and Olig1\u2212/\u2212 NPCs exhibited similar migration both rostral and caudal to the site of implantation at 1 and 3 weeks post-transplant indicating that Olig1 function does not regulate migration ( Figure 3A ). In addition, similar numbers of WT and Olig1\u2212/\u2212 NPCs were detected in transplanted mice indicating that replication is not negatively affected in the absence of Olig1 ( Figure 3B ). Importantly, positional migration of transplanted NPCs was not affected in the absence of Olig1 as both populations of NPCs preferentially migrated into ventral and lateral white matter columns of JHMV-infected mice ( Figure 3C ).

Spinal cord sections were used for either tracking migration of GFP-labeled NPCs or measuring remyelination to ensure that assessment of histopathology was performed within areas in which transplanted cells were present ( Figure 4A) . A representative spinal cord from a non-infected, non-transplanted mouse is shown to demonstrate normal myelin thickness ( Figure 4B ). Numerous demyelinated axons were present among vacuoles, myelin debris, and activated macrophages in JHMV-infected mice receiving either vehicle control ( Figure 4C ) or Olig1\u2212/ \u2212 NPCs ( Figure 4D ). In contrast, infected mice transplanted with WT NPCs exhibited numerous axons with thin myelin sheaths consistent with remyelination ( Figure 4E ). Quantification of remyelination in experimental groups of mice revealed an overall increase in the frequency of remyelinated axons in mice transplanted with WT NPCs when compared to either Olig1\u2212/\u2212 NPCs or vehicle control ( Figure 4F ) (Totoiu, et al., 2004) . Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining in combination with confocal microscopy revealed GFP signal overlying with MBP staining ( Figure 5A ) as well as GFP-positive wraps surrounding numerous axons (defined by neurofilament staining) ( Figure 5B ) in mice receiving WT NPCs yet this was absent in recipients of Olig1\u2212/\u2212 NPCs. These findings support and extend previous work from our laboratory indicating that transplantation of NPCs into JHMVinfected mice results in extensive remyelination , Totoiu, et al., 2004 . The overall paucity in remyelinated axons in Olig1\u2212/\u2212 NPCs suggests that although these cells are able to migrate and accumulate within areas of pathology they are not able to remyelinate demyelinated axons. Importantly, the demonstration of transplanted NPCderived myelin wraps surrounding axons in WT NPC recipients provides compelling evidence that transplanted cells directly remyelinate axons.",

The majority of WT NPCs had differentiated into NG2-positive OPCs (27.78% \u00b1 3.31) rather than mature oligodendrocytes as evidenced by GST-\u03c0 staining (11.83% \u00b1 0.72). In marked contrast, very few (<5%) of Olig1\u2212/\u2212 NPCs expressed either NG2 (4.11% \u00b1 1.92) or GST-\u03c0 (2.7%\u00b1 0.55) indicating these cells did not preferentially differentiate into a myelin-competent cell ( Figure 6A ). Indeed, staining for the astrocyte marker GFAP revealed that the majority (>70%) of transplanted Olig1\u2212/\u2212 NPCs were GFAP-positive (73.04% \u00b1 3.1) and displayed a morphology consistent with an activated astrocyte ( Figure  6B ). However, fewer than 20% of transplanted WT NPCs differentiated in GFAP-positive cells (17.05% \u00b1 3.57) ( Figure 6B ).",

For this and other devastating human white matter disorders, exogenous NPC and OPC transplantation are of great interest as having potential therapeutic roles (Conti, et ., 2008) . The use of a viral model of demyelination to evaluate the remyelination potential of NPCs has unique features that make this a relevant experimental model system. First, the etiology of the human demyelinating disease is enigmatic with both genetic factors and environmental influences considered important in initiation and maintenance of disease. Viral infection has long been viewed as a potential triggering mechanism involved in demyelination and numerous human viral pathogens have been suggested to be involved in eliciting myelin-reactive lymphocytes and/ or antibodies that subsequently infiltrate the CNS and damage the myelin sheath (Ascherio and Munger, 2007 , Ebers, et al., 1995 , Sospedra and Martin, 2005 . Therefore, viral models of demyelination are clearly relevant and have provided important insight into mechanisms associated with disease initiation, neuroinflammation and demyelination. Given the possibility of viral infection in initiating demyelination as well as the fact that numerous neurotropic viruses exist that are capable of persisting within the CNS, it is imperative to evaluate the remyelination potential of stem cells in the presence of a persistent viral infection that is correlative with chronic neuroinflammation and demyelination",

To address this, we used NPCs derived from mice deficient in the transcription factor Olig1. The genes Olig1 and Olig2 encode basic helix-loop helix transcription factors that are expressed in neural progenitor cells (Zhou, et al., 2000) and are required for fundamental processes of CNS development including oligodendrocyte formation . The Olig1-deficient mice we employed are viable and have mildly delayed myelination during development . However, they showed a profound deficiency in remyelination, indicating a nonredundant role for Olig1 in remyelination due to a defect in OPC differentiation to oligodendrocytes after white matter injury (Arnett, et al., 2004) . We note that this contrasts findings with a different Olig1-null line that shows a lethal developmental hypomyelination phenotype (Xin, et al., 2005) . Thus, Olig1 is critical for normal myelination and remyelination.",

Our findings reveal that engrafted Olig1\u2212/\u2212 NPCs were well tolerated, replicated, and migrated to a similar extent along white matter spinal cord tracts compared to WT NPCs. However, there was a marked reduction in the number of remyelinated axons in comparison to recipients of control cells. Paucity of remyelination from Olig1\u2212/\u2212 donor cells was associated with an apparent change in lineage fate commitment, as Olig1-null mice preferentially differentiated into GFAPpositive cells whereas WT cells exhibited commitment to an oligodendrocyte lineage. This was confirmed by our in vitro studies showing the importance of Olig1\u2212/\u2212 to enhance oligodendroglial lineage commitment, as the absence of this transcription factor seemed to favor the differentiation into astrocytes by NPCs.",

            "text": "In all recipients, WT NPCs migrated to demyelinated white matter and formed MBPcontaining processes that encircle neurofilament positive axons. These findings are consistent with several possibilities. First, Olig1 may be required to regulate cell fate differentiation of NPCs into OPCs; alternatively, Olig1 may be required to maintain OPC fate and in the absence of Olig1 function OPCs will \"trans-differentiate\" to astrocytes. We favor the former argument as in Olig1\u2212/\u2212 mice OPC fate and myelination proceeds to a level comparable to wildtype mice demonstrating Olig1 is not strictly required to maintain OPC fate. Therefore, our findings indicate that Olig1 is not required for migration into lesions but is important in selecting an oligodendrocyte lineage fate. These findings differ from, but are not in conflict, with Arnett et al (Arnett, et al., 2004) where OPCs were recruited into demyelinating lesions induced by lysolethicin treatment but failed to mature to participate in remyelination. Of note, in this study no increased astrogliosis in lesions was observed. Similarly, transplanted Olig1\u2212/\u2212 NPCs migrated yet did exhibit differentiation primarily into astrocytes. An important difference in these results may reflect differences in model systems utilized. While lysolethicin induces focal demyelinating lesions in the absence of infiltration of activated T lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophages, JHMVinduced demyelination is characterized by the presence of activated T lymphocytes as well as other inflammatory cells that results in the secretion of numerous proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines (Bergmann, et al., 2006 . Therefore, one intriguing possibility is that the inflammatory microenvironment may tailor NPCs fate decision through an Olig1-regulated mechanism. In addition, these findings are consistent with other studies highlighting the importance of Olig1 in contributing to myelin repair following experimental demyelination (Burton, 2005 Our findings suggest that exogenous NPCs actively participate in remyelination following engraftment. This is supported by counting remyelinated axons in experimental animals as well as the presence of GFP-positive wraps encircling axons following transplantation of wild type NPCs. Our findings are consistent with earlier studies by Cummings et al. (Cummings, et al., 2005 ) that demonstrated engraftment of human NPCs promoted locomotor recovery in a rodent model of spinal cord injury. Importantly, recovery was abolished by selective ablation of engrafted cells suggesting that the therapeutic benefit was mediated primarily by engrafted cells. However, a recent report indicated that transplanted neural progenitors were shown to enhance proliferation of host OPCs (Einstein, et al., 2009 ). This was associated with increased remyelination in a model of cuprizone-mediated demyelination indicating that transplanted neural progenitors stimulated endogenous cells to participate in repair. Differences between experimental outcomes most likely reflect differences within the model systems employed as cuprizone represents an acute and focal model of demyelination with a limited role for activated lymphocytes in participating in myelin destruction and this is dramatically different compared to JHMV-induced demyelination. Therefore, the environmental signals encountered by engrafted cells will modulate the ability of the engrafted cell to home, differentiate, and participate in repair. With this in mind, our results reveal insight into the importance of Olig1 within the context of engrafted NPCs into an ongoing immune-mediated demyelinating disease initiated by viral infection: i) Olig1 does not influence NPC positional migration, ii) Olig1 is required for differentiation into OPCs/oligodendrocytes, and iii) preferential differentiation into oligolineage cells is associated with increased remyelination.",
