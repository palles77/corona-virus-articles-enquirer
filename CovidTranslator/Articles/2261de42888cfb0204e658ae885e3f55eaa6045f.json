In this study, we incorporated data on microbiologically confirmed infections and seroprevalence to comprehensively describe the epidemiology of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza. Seroprevalence was determined from 1,795 random serum samples collected in our hospital in January 2007 (before the first wave of the pandemic) and March 2010 (after the second wave). Data on microbiologically confirmed infection and severe cases were obtained from the Centre for Health Protection in Hong Kong. Severe cases were most common in the 51-to 60-year-old age group. The microbiologically confirmed incidence rate was highest for children aged <10 years and dropped sharply for the adult population ( \u202b\u060d\u202c \u060a1.0; P < 0.01), but the incidence rate for severe disease was highest for the 51-to 60-year-old age group. For the 51-to 60-year-old age group, the seroprevalence was similar to that for the younger age groups, but the proportion of severe cases relative to seroprevalence was significantly higher than that for 11-to 50-year-old age groups. As judged from the percentage of specimens positive for other respiratory viruses compared with that for pandemic H1N1 virus, the impact of symptomatic disease due to pandemic H1N1 virus was higher than that for other respiratory viruses in people aged <50 years. In conclusion, the 51-to 60-year-old age group, which had the highest overall incidence and the highest rate of severe disease but is currently not considered by the World Health Organization to be an at-risk group, should be prioritized for influenza vaccination in areas where universal influenza vaccination is not practiced.",

Data on agespecific incidence rates from the influenza pandemic can provide a scientific basis for formulating public health policies and insights on the age-related susceptibility to and severity of influenza. Currently, there are discrepancies in the age cutoffs in recommendations for influenza vaccination, especially for adults. While the World Health Organization considers individuals aged \u054665 years to be at a higher risk of severe influenza and includes them as one of the target groups for influenza vaccination and antiviral treatment or prophylaxis (50) , the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention extended influenza vaccination to all persons aged \u05466 months and, in the event of vaccine shortage, to those aged \u054650 years (18) .",

If the total number of microbiologically confirmed cases is used as the denominator, this overestimates the severe case incidence rate because infections without microbiological confirmation are excluded. On the other hand, influenza-like illness (ILI) is often used as a surrogate marker for total number of cases, but this may be inaccurate, especially if the surveillance period extends over a long period, when many ILIs may be due to other respiratory pathogens. Other epidemiological studies have used seroprevalence as a measure of the infected population, and these studies have reported a high prevalence in young adults and more severe disease in the pediatric and geriatric populations (27, 30) , which may be explained by the immature immune system and immunosenescence, respectively (37, 40) .

This is supported by our finding that the burden of severe disease is highest in the 61-to 70-year-old age group and is consistent with other studies which have shown that those aged \u054660 or \u054665 years have higher casefatality ratios (10, 14, 17) . However, we have also demonstrated that the 51-to 60-year-old age group has the highest incidence rate of severe disease among all age groups and a higher burden of severe disease than that for younger age groups. Our result is comparable to worldwide estimates obtained by using laboratory-confirmed cases as the denominator in the calculation for the rate of severe cases, as the 50-to 64-year-old age group had the highest relative risk of admission to an intensive care unit for most countries (47) . Likewise, a study from California showed that the highest incidence rate of death occurred in those aged 50 to 59 years (30) . However, neither study estimated the burden of severe disease in all infected individuals by monitoring the change in seroprevalence before and after the first wave. Rather, they used the total population as the denominator for the analysis. The find- (18) . Our finding was unlikely to be caused by specimen collection bias, as the positivity rate for other respiratory viruses was not different from that for the 41-to 50-year-old age group. The high incidence rate of severe disease in this age group therefore justifies lowering the age cutoff for the highrisk group from 65 to 51 years old. The burden of symptomatic disease was lowest in the age groups including persons aged 21 to 60 years, suggesting that there were many patients with mild disease who did not require medical attention and therefore were not tested for respiratory viruses in this age group. This result is consistent with the findings of another large prospective study in which most pa- tients in this age group were only mildly symptomatic (6) . The burden of severe disease was also lower in the age groups including persons aged 21 to 60 years than in older age groups. Despite such a low burden of severe disease, the absolute numbers of severe cases in these age groups were actually higher than in those above 60 years old, similar to the case in previous studies (13, 25, 28, 38, 45, 48) , because a large proportion of the population in these age groups was infected due to the lack of preexisting cross-reactive antibodies against the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. We also speculate that this particular age group has developed a solid cell-mediated immunity due to a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response or nonneutralizing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against the highly conserved viral antigens on the viral matrix or nucleoprotein (12, 26) , which is important in recovery from the illness. Such relative protection induced by repeated exposure before and after the age of 20 years decayed with age-associated immunosenescence or was impaired by major underlying disease in those over 50 years of age.",

Factors associated with lower rates of seroconversion have been described, including older age, being female, being pregnant, or having milder disease (7, 9, 32, 42) . Notably, 10% of convalescentphase plasma donors of influenza virus had HI titers of \u03fd40 (21). These factors contribute to a lower seroprevalence rate, which leads to an underestimation of the incidence of infection. In contrast, vaccination leads to seroconversion, and therefore seroprevalence may overestimate the incidence of infection in areas where vaccine coverage is high. However, the pandemic H1N1 vaccination uptake rate was very low in Hong Kong after one widely publicized report of a suspected influenza-related complication of Guillain-Barre syndrome in a medical doctor. Up to 31 March 2010, only 188,622 individuals in the Hong Kong influenza vaccination program (2.7% of the total Hong Kong population) had received the monovalent pandemic H1N1 vaccine, while an additional 61,107 doses of vaccine had been distributed to private practitioners for individuals who were excluded from the at-risk target group in the vaccination program. However, the exact number of vaccinees in the private sector outside the government vaccination program is not known, as these data are not reported to the CHP. But even if this batch of vaccine were all administered to patients, the percentage of vaccinated population would be only 3.6%. Therefore, the effect of vaccination is negligible.",

However, since other studies of this age group showed very low prevalence rates of preexisting antibody of \u03fd5% (34), the interpretation of our results should be similar for this age group. Unexpectedly, there were unexplained small changes in seroposivity between 2007 and 2010 for the 61-to 80-year-old age groups. Finally, the differences in rates of severe infection may have been confounded by factors such as underlying diseases. In our study, we found a higher incidence of severe infection in the 51-to 60-year-old age group. In Hong Kong, 22.5% of the population in the age group of 50-to 59-year-olds has chronic diseases, compared to 2.8 to 10.7% of those aged less than 50 years (23). We were not able to access the clinical data for each patient, as the serum samples were coded anonymously. Further studies incorporating underlying diseases will allow an assessment of the independent effect of age on severity in this age group.",

In contrast to the usual age cutoff of 65 years, our results clearly demonstrate that individuals of more than 50 years of age are more prone to severe infection than the younger population. In view of our findings, health authorities should consider lowering the at-risk group from those above 65 years of age to those above 51 years of age.",
