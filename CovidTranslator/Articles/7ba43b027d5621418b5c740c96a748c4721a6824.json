            "text": "Purpose: This study evaluates the use of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) to differentiate smear-positive, active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) from other pulmonary infections in the emergency room (ER) setting. Methods: One hundred and eighty-three patients diagnosed with pulmonary infections in an ER were divided into an acid fast bacillus (AFB) smear-positive, active PTB group (G1 = 84) and a non-AFB smearpositive, pulmonary infection group (G2 = 99). HRCT images from a 64-Multidetector CT were analyzed, retrospectively, for the morphology, number, and segmental distribution of pulmonary lesions. Results: Utilizing multivariate analysis, five variables were found to be independent risk factors predictive of G1: (1) consolidation involving the apex segment of right upper lobe, posterior segment of the right upper lobe, or apico-posterior segment of the left upper lobe; (2) consolidation involving the superior segment of the right or left lower lobe; (3) presence of a cavitary lesion; (4) presence of clusters of nodules; (5) absence of centrilobular nodules. A G1 prediction score was generated based on these 5 criteria to help differentiate G1 from G2. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.96 \u00b1 0.012 in our prediction model. With an ideal cut-off point score of 3, the specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) are 90.9%, 96.4%, 90.0% and 96.8%, respectively. Conclusion: The use of this AFB smear-positive, active PTB prediction model based on 5 key HRCT findings may help ER physicians determine whether or not isolation is required while awaiting serial sputum smear results in high risk patients.",

            "text": "Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis currently affects nearly one-third of the world's population [1] . Highly contagious pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) can masquerade as communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) and escape initial diagnosis by emergency room (ER) physicians, thereby increasing the risk of nosocomial infection and further transmission to the general population [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Current screening methods recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) involve respiratory isolation (RI) of suspected PTB patients until 3 sputum samples obtained over 48 h are negative [6] . This expanded RI policy for all patients suspected of PTB in the United States led to the proper isolation of over 95% of PTB upon admission; however, it also resulted in an 8-fold overuse of the isolation room, and eventually led to an insufficient number of isolation rooms [7] . Under the threatening of acute lung disease such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and the new H1N1 influenza nowadays, a 3-day isolation policy for waiting times for smear results for all patients merely suspected of active PTB, may prove too burdensome for most hospitals [8, 9] . Furthermore, an isolation policy based solely upon negative sputum samples may not adequately account for the truly positive sputums missed due to low organism loads [10] . Therefore, more effective diagnostic tests and/or criteria for differentiating those patients at highest risk of active PTB are desperately needed.",

The subsequent costs associated with late treatment and contact investigation could actually offset the original savings [31] . During flu season, influenza is one of the leading causes of ER visits, and the availability of isolation rooms is essential [30] . With this in mind, we created a G1 prediction score based on 5 key HRCT findings: (1) consolidation involving the apex segment of either lung (s1), posterior segment of the right upper lobe (s2), or apico-posterior segment of the left upper lobe (s1 + s2); (2) consolidation involving the superior segment of the right or left lower lobe (s6); (3) presence of a cavitary lesion; (4) presence of clusters of nodules; (5) absence of centrilobular nodules. The ROC curve (Fig. 3) identified a score of 3 points as the cut-off. At this point, the sensitivity hits 96.4%, and the NPV approaches 96.8%. An ideal test would have both 100% sensitivity to avoid missing any patients with active disease and 100% NPV to assure negative results truly represented diseasefree status. This is extremely important in public health situations that deal with highly infectious diseases like AFB sputum positive, active PTB.",

Compared to serial sputum smear analysis currently endorsed by the CDC, first sputum NAA demonstrated an 87% sensitivity and 99% NPV in this study. The future of diagnostic testing may soon include the use of first sputum NAA, but current guidelines are still in effect. Furthermore, if sputum was not available from spontaneous cough or specimens of bronchoscope, the NAA test was not feasible. Our study demonstrates the effective use of HRCT to predict smear-positive, active PTB cases in advance of the serial sputum results or patients without spontaneous sputum, thereby decreasing the transmission rate and opening up isolation rooms needed for other communicable diseases, such as influenza and SARS.",
