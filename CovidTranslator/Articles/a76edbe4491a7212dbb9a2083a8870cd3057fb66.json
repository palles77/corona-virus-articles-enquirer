However, there is still a need to optimize the biocatalysts. The aim of this work was to increase the titre of terpenyl glucosides in biotransformation assays with E. coli expressing VvGT14ao, a glycosyltransferase gene from grape (Vitis vinifera). Seven expression plasmids differing in the resistance gene, origin of replication, promoter sequence, and fusion protein tag were generated and transformed into four different E. coli expression strains, resulting in 18 strains that were tested for glycosylation efficiency with terpenols and a phenol. E. coli BL21(DE3)/ pET-SUMO_VvGT14ao yielded the highest titres. The product concentration was improved 8.6-fold compared with E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS/pET29a_VvGT14ao. The selection of a small solubility-enhancing protein tag and exploitation of the T7 polymerase-induction system allowed the formation of increased levels of functional recombinant protein, thereby improving the performance of the whole-cell biocatalyst.",

            "text": "Enzymes offer tremendous opportunities for the chemical industry as they can efficiently and economically convert molecules and replace well-known and established industrial processes with more sustainable ones. Traditionally, enzymes are used by food and feed industry, but are increasingly implemented in emerging markets such as pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries [18] . The production of catalytically active proteins in heterologous microbial and fungal hosts leads to lower costs and high yields, which is crucial for the economy of an industrial process. Escherichia coli is the host of choice if post-translational modifications of the enzyme are not required for its activity [19] . The use of E. coli as whole-cell biocatalyst offers additional benefits such as cofactor regeneration, high catalytic efficiency and mild and simple reaction conditions [24] . However, the production of misfolded and inactive aggregates such as inclusion bodies is problematic when recombinant proteins are over-expressed in bacteria. Strategies for overcoming this disadvantage of heterologous expression are the optimization of the expression system, e.g. by using tightly regulated promoters or by attaching solubility-enhancing fusion tags. When using whole-cell biocatalysts for biocatalysis, substrate and product transmembrane transport and cofactor regeneration capacity of the used strain must similarly be considered. For the moment, the most promising method for whole-cell biocatalysis seems to be the use of engineered E. coli, which offers the potential for large-scale and costeffective production.",

These enzymes transfer carbohydrate residues from activated sugar donors to a multitude of acceptor molecules, including proteins, saccharides, lipids and small molecules. Glycosylation of their -OH, -NH 2 , -SH, and -COOH groups results in O-, N-, S-glucosides, and sugar esters, respectively [16] . Uridine diphosphate sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGT) form the largest group and are characterized by a unique C-terminal consensus sequence representing the sugar donor site [22] . Plant genomes are rich sources for UGT genes, which code, among others for biocatalysts that can transfer sugars to small molecules and on-going sequencing projects continuously deliver new nucleotide sequences (http://supfa m.org/). These UGTs are capable of efficiently glycosylating various plant metabolites from different chemical classes in a stereo-and regioselective manner [23] . VvGT14a from grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is a promiscuous enzyme that can efficiently glucosylate not only terpenols such as geraniol, citronellol and nerol, but also eugenol [2] . Thus, plant glycosyltransferases are ideal biocatalysts for the biochemical and biotechnological production of small molecule glucosides but utilize costly cosubstrates such as UDP-glucose, which requires the use of whole-cell biocatalysts for cosubstrate recycling and efficient production [7] .",

Kanamycin was more stable and better suited for high cell-density fermentations [31, 32] . The ori determines the plasmid copy number (PCN). Plasmids with the pBR322 ori resulted in a PCN of approximately 15-20 [3] , whereas the high-copy ori RSF yielded PCN of over 100 copies [6] . The promoter affects the expression strength and tac and T7 are considered strong, inducible promoters [4, 35] . A gene containing a T7 promoter is only transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase encoded by the lambda DE3 prophage insertion. Therefore, only strains with the (DE3) insertion transcribe genes harbouring a T7 promoter [15] . The small fusion tags, His-tag and S-tag, are mainly used for protein purification purposes [40] while larger fusion tags are said to improve solubility. The SUMO-and the trxA-tags are 100 and 109 amino acids long, respectively, and the glutathione S-transferase (GST)tag has a length of 211 amino acids [26] . Other fusion tags like NusA and MBP are also often used to facilitate higher solubility, however they are even bigger than GST with 495 and 396 amino acids, respectively [7] . NusA and MBP were not investigated in this study due to their enormous sizes. The aim of an optimal fusion protein is to facilitate higher solubility without impeding the strain's metabolism.",

The glucosyltransferase gene VvGT14a was isolated from Vitis vinifera and the encoded protein biochemically characterized [2] . VvGT14ao was cloned in frame with the N-terminal GST tag into the pGEX-4T-1 expression vector (Amersham Bioscience), which was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany) synthesized the codon-optimized gene VvGT14ao. The expression vector pET-SUMO_VvGT14ao was produced by ligation independent cloning (LIC) [12] . The entry vector was linearized by using SspI and subsequently treated with T4 DNA polymerase and dGTP. The gene of interest was amplified by PCR using primers with the LIC-site extension (Supplemental Table S1 ). The purified PCR product was treated with T4 DNA polymerase and dCTP. The annealing was performed with a vector-to-insert ratio of 1:3 regarding to the amount of substance. All other constructs were produced by standard cloning procedures. For the cloning of the VvGT14ao gene, the entry vectors were digested with BamHI and NotI and dephosphorylated with FastAP. The gene of interest was amplified by PCR using primers with the corresponding BamHI-/NotI-extensions (Supplemental Table S1 ). Where applicable, the primers were additionally expanded with spacer bases to assure an in-frame insertion. The cleavage was also done with BamHI and NotI. The constructs were finished with a ligation. The vectors pGEX-K and pET32aK are modified versions of pGEX-4T-1 and pET32a. Their ampicillin cassettes were exchanged with the kanamycin resistance cassette KanR2 from pRSFDuet-1. For the cloning of pET32aK two parts, pET32a backbone and the kanamycin resistance gene, were amplified by PCR using primers with an Eco31I + linker-extension (Supplemental Table S1 ). Both parts were cleaved with the IIS nuclease Eco31I, creating two unique overhangs. The construct was finished with a ligation. For the cloning of pGEX-K, the entry vector pGEX-4T-1 was digested with AatII and BsaI and dephosphorylated by using FastAP. Subsequently, the DNA fragment was gel purified. The kanamycin resistance gene was amplified by PCR using primers with the corresponding AatII/BsaI-extensions (Supplemental Table S1 ). The cleavage of both parts was performed with AatII and BsaI. The construct was finished after ligation. All ligations were performed by T4 DNA ligase (Promega) with a vectorto-insert ratio of 1:3 by weight. The codon-optimized UGT gene VvGT14ao was cloned by a standard restriction-ligation procedure into respective plasmids to obtain pET29a_VvG-T14ao, pET32a_VvGT14ao, pET32aK_VvGT14ao, pGEX-4T-1_VvGT14ao, pGEX-K_VvGT14ao and pRSFDuet-1_ VvGT14ao (Supplemental Figure S1 ).

The plates allowed the downscaling from shaking flasks with 50 mL of culture to a working volume of 2 mL culture per well. Each well had a total volume of 25 mL, which allowed for high rotational speeds (Supplemental Table S2 ). The formation of a wave inside the wells could only be observed at rotational speeds upwards of 200 rpm. The maximum wave height was 6, 13, and 16 mm above the resting liquid level at rotational speeds of 300, 400, and 500 rpm, respectively. The formation of a wave increases the liquids surface and improves the surface/volume ratio further. This was necessary for good aeration and thus for unhindered cell growth. Experiments could be performed in parallel and in multiple determination across the 24 wells (4 \u00d7 6) of the plate. Multiple repetitions of biotransformation experiments confirmed the reproducibility of the experimental results (Fig. 1) . Initially, the cell densities were adjusted before induction. Since the cell densities were only slightly different, but the workload involved was high, the laborious adaptation was omitted. Since the glucosyltransferase VvG-T14ao (codon-optimized) from grapevine, which was used to develop the whole-cell biocatalysts exhibited promiscuous activity toward terpenols and phenols [2] , four alcohols (geraniol, nerol, citronellol, and eugenol) were used as substrates.

The highest product titres were generated from E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS when vectors carrying an ampicillin resistance (pET32a_ VvGT14ao, and pGEX-4T-1_VvGT14ao) were used. The E. coli Waksman strain only produced small amounts of glucosides under the applied testing conditions. In summary, it is anticipated that the expression of a SUMO-VvGT14ao fusion protein in E. coli BL21 would result a highly efficient whole-cell biocatalyst for the production of terpenyl and phenyl \u03b2-d-glucopyranosides. The results of the HP cultivation can be employed to select promising production strains for scale-up experiments in shaking flasks. The system can also be adapted to test other production strains for various whole-cell biotransformation applications.",

The column was a Luna \u00ae 3 \u00b5m C18 LC column 150 \u00d7 2 mm from Phenomenex (Aschaffenburg, Germany). The sample ran under isocratic conditions with 45% (v/v) methanol at 0.2 mL/min for 8 min, except for the analysis of citronellyl glucoside, which ran for 12 min. The substances were measured with the UV detector at 210 nm. The products geranyl glucoside, neryl glucoside, citronellyl glucoside and eugenyl glucoside eluted at 5.4 min, 5.5 min, 8.3 min and 3.2 min, respectively. The calibration was done with authentical reference material. The statistically analysis was done with Microsoft Office Excel.",

The combination of all suitable strains and vectors resulted in a total of 18 different strains. Each vector contained the gene coding for the glycosyltransferase VvGT14ao from Vitis vinifera.

Combined product formation in [mM] (b). The different strains are separated by different bar styles: doted bars for E. coli BL21, dark grey bars for E. coli BL21(DE3), light grey bars for E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, and diagonally striped bars for E. coli Waks-man. Strains 1 through 12 contained a kanamycin resistance gene while strains 13 through 18 contained an ampicillin resistance gene (a). The subcategories represent the different expression vectors and are separated by vertical grey lines. The expression vectors from left to right are pRSFDuet-1, pET29a, pET32aK, pET-SUMO, pGEX-K, pET32a, and pGEX-4T-1. Each expression vector contained the gene coding for VvGT14a from Vitis vinifera.
