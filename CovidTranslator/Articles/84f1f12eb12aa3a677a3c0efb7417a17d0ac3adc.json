We applied a sequenceindependent, single-primer amplification method to amplify the genome of PHEV from extracted RNA. We used the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) to prepare a next-generation sequencing library followed by sequencing on MiSeq. We used both Ray and SPAdes softwares for de novo assemble of 9 PHEV strains. We closed small sequencing gaps by using a Sanger sequencing method, and reamplified 2 strains (15SW0331 and 15SW0582) with a relatively smaller percentage of genome coverage (54% and 80%, respectively) by using 21 pairs of PHEV-specific primers followed by sequencing on MiSeq. We aligned and compared sequences using MUSCLE (MEGA Software version 6.06; www.megasoftware.net). We confirmed all insertions and deletions by Sanger sequencing. We performed phylogenetic comparison of the sequenced PHEV strains to reference coronavirus Page 3 of 10 sequences obtained from GenBank by complete sequence, nonstructural 2 (NS2) gene, spike gene, and NS4.9 gene. We constructed dendrograms using the neighbor-joining method with the MEGA software package.

IAV surveillance activities during 2015 involved agricultural fairs beyond Michigan, including those taking place in Ohio and Indiana. We selected samples from 14 fairs from each of those states (n = 280 per state) for PHEV screening to compare them to the prevalence in Michigan exhibition swine. Fairs from Ohio and Indiana were selected based on influenza-like illness (ILI) in the pigs, corresponding time to Michigan fairs, and IAV-negative swine samples.

Among the PHEV strains identified in the current study, the genomes range from identical to 1.8% difference, demonstrating presence of distinct strains. Further analysis reveals that the PHEV strains identified in the present study contain deletions and/or insertions in different genes, including open reading frame 1b (ORF1b), NS2, spike, NS4.9, and 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) (Technical Appendix Figures 2-4). Compared with VW572, 4 (15SW0331, 15SW0582, 15SW1362, and 15SW1765) of the 10 PHEV samples contain a 3-nt deletion (GTA) in the ORF1b at positions 20089-20091, resulting in a 1-amino-acid deletion (NEP vs. NGKP). In comparison with VW572, HECV 4408, Kakegawa, and WD470, all 10 PHEV strains have different deletion patterns in the NS2 gene, resulting in 5 different lengths of the NS2 gene. Five strains (15SW1209, 15SW1582, 15SW1655, 15SW1727, and 15SW1785) have a truncated NS2 gene, with the smallest genome nt, and 751 nt in length, respectively, longer than that of VW572, but encode only 5 aa because of a premature stop codon caused by a 44-nt deletion in the 5\u2032 NS2. 15SW25049 has the largest size of NS2 gene, 826 nt, encoding a 195-aa protein, which is 1 aa longer than that of VW572 NS2 protein. In the case of the spike gene, compared with VW572, 9 PHEV strains have a 3-nt deletion (AAT) at positions 2680-2682, resulting in a single amino acid deletion (N, Asn), whereas 15SW25049 does not have this deletion (just as in 2 Canadian PHEV strains [67N and IAF-404]). In the case of the NS4.9 gene, 3 different deletion patterns were identified in the 10 PHEV-positive samples, as compared to VW572. The deletions result in 3 different lengths of NS4.9 (15SW0582 and 15SW1362: 13aa; 15SW0331 and 15SW1765: 28aa; 15SW1209, 15SW1582, 15SW1655, 15SW1727, 15SW1785 and 15SW25049: 20aa) (Technical Appendix Figures 6 and 7). The truncated NS4.9 protein pattern of 15SW1209, 15SW1582, 15SW1655, 15SW1727, 15SW1785 and 15SW25049 has been previously reported in 2 Canadian PHEV strains (67N and IAF-404) (3). In the 3\u2032 UTR, compared with VW570, all 10 PHEV strains we detected have 1 unique single nucleotide deletion at position 174, and 5 strains (15SW0331, 15SW0582, 15SW1362, 15SW1765 and 15SW25049) have an additional single nucleotide deletion at position 190. We identified the NS2 gene of PHEV in 1 sample (15SW24992) and detected porcine parainfluenza virus-1 (PPIV-1) in 1 sample (15SW0582) in addition to PHEV.",
