In addition, it is important to consider the diagnosis of PCP which has a prevalence of 22% among HIV-infected adults admitted with CAP in sub-Saharan Africa (17, 18) . P. jirovecii was identified on quantitative PCR from 18% of adult CAP patients in South Africa in 2014; however in some cases, identification on PCR may indicate colonisation (12) . The risk of CAP in HIV-infected individuals, as well as the probability of identifying mixed or atypical infections, increases with decreasing CD4+T cell count (19) .",

In contrast to primary care, X-rays are widely available and all patients presenting to hospital with suspected CAP require a CXR to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other potential causes for their illness (5) . The accuracy of CXR for the diagnosis of pneumonia is not known but it is considered the reference standard for ruling-out the diagnosis of CAP when normal. However, even a normal CXR is not sufficient to eliminate the diagnosis in the setting of a very high pretest probability (34) . CXR is not a good test for rulingin CAP and alternative diagnoses should be considered for patients with abnormal CXRs in the absence of compatible clinical features of CAP. Therefore, as in all infectious diseases, the diagnosis of CAP in severely ill patients depends on the likelihood (or risk) of having the disease and the finding of supportive features using a combination of history, examination and chest radiography. In severely ill hospitalised patients with suspected pneumonia and a normal CXR, it is not unreasonable to start empiric antibiotic therapy (48) , which may be stopped if appropriate cultures are negative and a repeat CXR at 24-48 hours remains clear of new infiltrates (5). This is supported by a large cohort study where 7% of patients admitted with suspected CAP and an initially normal CXR developed changes consistent with CAP on a repeat CXR (48) . In most circumstances, however, the administration of antibiotics for suspected CAP without CXR confirmation has been associated with inaccurate diagnosis (49) and overuse of antibiotics (50) .",

The common microbiological investigations that would be performed in the setting of CAP are BC, sputum culture, and detection of Legionella and pneumococcal antigens in urine. In addition, molecular tests are becoming more commonly employed, and serology may also be used. The benefit of identifying the aetiological agent is primarily to assist in directing antimicrobial therapy. This can result either in a change to broaden the spectrum of activity for an organism not adequately treated by the initial, empiric, regimen (which would directly benefit the patient), or to change to a narrower spectrum agent if a susceptible organism is identified (which is less likely to directly benefit the patient, but is in line with antibiotic stewardship principles, and will hopefully have a broader benefit on society). Other reasons to attempt to identify aetiological agents are to identify organisms of potential public health importance (e.g., influenza) and to better understand the epidemiology of CAP-which in turn influences clinical practice. However, these investigations are associated with increased health care costs. The decision of whether or not to perform microbiological investigations in patients with CAP is sometimes debateable. As a general rule, investigations would be recommended where there is a reasonable chance of the result influencing the management of the patient. The yield of BC in the setting of CAP ranges from about 5-14%. Guidelines for appropriate collection of BCs have been published (61), and will not be reviewed here. The likelihood of a patient with CAP having a positive BC is increased with severity of illness. While a number of studies have described clinical parameters associated with increased chance of a positive BC, due to differences in study design and clinical parameters described, different studies have identified different parameters associated with bacteraemia. These include neutrophilia (62) , low WCC, raised creatinine, hypoglycaemia, temperature >38 \u2103 (63), elevated PSI score (64); tachycardia, tachypnoea and hypotension (65) , and low oxygen saturation (66) .",

Thus, the major benefit of a Gram stain on a well-collected sputum sample is that it may allow for the broadening of antimicrobial cover for S. aureus or gram-negative bacilli. However, it must be borne in mind that in the majority of patients, the microscopy will be unhelpful, with no predominant micro-organism observed. Only approximately 25-40% of patients will have an adequate sample obtained (68, 69) and the yield on culture of these adequate samples can be as high as 80%. However, when assessing the sputum culture yield in all patients with CAP, it can be as low as 15% overall, since a proportion of patients are unable to produce sputum, and a proportion of samples will be unsatisfactory. As with BCs, sputum samples should only be sent for culture if the result is likely to influence patient management.",

In addition, for the pneumococcal antigen test, the question is what incremental yield is obtained over sputum and BC. A recent meta-analysis found that the UAT may identify an additional 11% of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, over and above those identified with culture (10). However, a study from Switzerland found that the addition of the UAT for S. pneumoniae did not influence antibiotic choices or clinical outcomes (72) . Given that empiric regimens for CAP always include agents active against S. pneumoniae this is not surprising. A similar argument could be made regarding the use of the Legionella UAT, since patients with severe CAP will be treated with an agent active against this pathogen. However, there are no readily available alternative tests to detect Legionella, and the knowledge may have epidemiological importance. Thus, while further research is needed to guide practice regarding narrowing of spectrum when a UAT is positive, there may be some justification for testing patients with severe CAP for Legionella using a UAT.",

Thus, the results will not impact immediate patient management, and the routine use of serology is not recommended. (78, 79) , in any patient admitted to ICU (80) , and in those with subacute illness or those not responding to empiric antimicrobial therapy. Traditional diagnostic tests for TB have major drawbacks; automated liquid culture systems are the gold standard for the diagnosis of TB but are expensive and require prolonged incubation while sputum smear microscopy has a much lower diagnostic yield (81) , particularly in HIV-infected patients, and does not provide drug susceptibility data. In response to these limitations, the NDOH recently rolled out GeneXpert MTB/RIF\u00ae (Xpert) (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) as a replacement for smear microscopy to diagnose pulmonary TB in South Africa. The assay has overall pooled sensitivities of 88% to detect culture-positive TB cases, and 67% after a negative smear microscopy result (82) . A major advantage of the test is that it is able to rapidly detect patients with rifampicin resistance. Sputum induction provides an adequate sample and a bacteriological diagnosis more frequently than instruction by a health-care worker but is costlier and does not result in a higher proportion of same-day diagnoses (83) . Other WHO endorsed and clinically validated rapid molecular TB tests are also in use in South Africa. Certain genotypic assays, such as line probe assays, may have diagnostic accuracy that is comparable to Xpert MTB/RIF and have the added advantage of detecting both isoniazid and rifampicin resistance as well as susceptibility to second line TB drugs (84) (85) (86) .",

In the study by Ruiz and colleagues (105) , comorbid pulmonary disease, hepatic and nervous system illnesses as well as current smoking and alcohol abuse were associated with distinct patterns of aetiology for each of those conditions. In that study, respiratory comorbidities were defined as treatment for asthma or COPD, or presence of interstitial lung disorders, hepatic comorbidities were defined as pre-existing viral or toxic hepatopathy and nervous system illnesses were defined as symptomatic acute or chronic vascular or nonvascular encephalopathy with or without dementia. For example, in that study patients with pulmonary disorders were at a greater risk of infections with gram-negative enteric bacilli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the study by El-Solh et al. (106) , activities of daily living index, and pulmonary (defined as treatment for COPD or interstitial lung disease), endocrine (defined as diabetes mellitus) and CNS (defined as symptomatic acute or chronic vascular or nonvascular encephalopathy) comorbidities were associated with similar Box 2 WHO case definition for PCP in patients with HIV Dyspnoea on exertion or non-productive cough of recent onset (within the past three months), tachypnoea and fever And chest X-ray evidence of diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates And no evidence of bacterial pneumonia: bilateral crackles on auscultation with or without reduced breath sounds distinct aetiological patterns. The study by Cilloniz and co-workers (107) documented that pathogens such as S. aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and H. Influenzae only occurred in CAP patients with one or more comorbidities, which included one or more of the following; chronic respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic cardiovascular disease, neurologic disease, chronic liver disease, and chronic renal disease, with these comorbidities not being further defined. In addition, multiple medical comorbid conditions have been documented to be a risk factor for penicillin-resistant and other drug-resistant pneumococcal infections (108) . Patients treated at home who are <65 years old, without antibiotic exposure in the past 90 days or comorbidities should receive oral high dose amoxicillin. Patients treated at home who are \u226565 years old, have received antibiotics within the previous 90 days or who have comorbidities should receive oral amoxicillin-clavulanate or an oral second generation cephalosporin.

Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of critically ill patients with CAP, comparing macrolidebased therapies with other regimens clearly indicated that macrolide use was associated with a significant reduction in mortality compared with non-macrolide containing regimens, and the benefit became even more significant with the pooling of data from studies that provided adjusted risk estimates (112, 113) . This mortality benefit from the use of macrolide-based combination antibiotic regimens versus other antibiotic regimens in critically ill patients was also supported by studies of survival among intubated patients with CAP (114) and among CAP patients with severe sepsis, the latter even when evaluating patients with CAP infections due to macrolide-resistant pathogens (e.g., macrolideresistant pneumococci and gram-negative pathogens) (115) . Patients with severe CAP should therefore be treated with a combination of amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime or a third generation (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) cephalosporin plus a macrolide/azalide antibiotic. An alternative regimen for severe CAP is a respiratory fluoroquinolone, which should be combined with another agent, most commonly a beta-lactam. In adults hospitalised with CAP, antibiotic therapy initiated within 4-8 hours of hospital arrival was associated with lower adjusted short-term mortality (113) .",

The data generated from these studies and systematic reviews have recently been extensively reviewed (140) . One of the most comprehensive meta-analyses was that of Siemieniuk and colleagues (138) , who in addition to undertaking an extensive extraction of the literature, analysed the data for all possible benefits and potential harms, using instruments to assess risk of bias in the individual studies, as well as publication bias, and the GRADE system to evaluate the quality/certainty of the evidence. The final assessment of findings was that corticosteroid use was associated with a lower mortality (significant only in the severe CAP group), reduction in need for mechanical ventilation, the occurrence of ARDS, time to clinical stability and length of hospital stay with the evidence being of moderate or higher quality (138) . There are still unanswered questions regarding corticosteroid use, including which patients with CAP are most likely to benefit, which corticosteroids to use, at what dose and for how long. However, the data from the various studies and meta-analyses suggest that those with severe CAP requiring ICU admission, those with the highest inflammatory indices (such as a CRP level above 150 mg/L) and those with shock requiring vasopressor support are most likely to benefit (140) . The recommended regimen is methylprednisone 0.5 mg/kg/12 h or equivalent for 5 days (135) . While patients with diabetes (141) and those receiving long-term steroids have been included in RCTs, there are limited data in patients with HIV infection.",

In such cases, a pleural fluid pH of <7.2 indicates the need for urgent drainage of the effusion, if pH is 7.2-7.3 it is reasonable to observe the patient while a pleural fluid pH of >7.3 suggests that the effusion may be managed with systemic antibiotics alone (155, 156) .

Acute lung abscess, associated with a short duration of symptoms and a rapidly-evolving chest radiograph, is a rare complication of CAP. Risk factors include immunosuppression, inappropriate antibiotic selection, and infection with S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. Acute lung abscess should be differentiated from a chronic abscess (presenting with indolent symptoms that evolve over a period of weeks or months) seen most commonly in the debilitated or alcoholic patient, and following aspiration in a patient with a reduced level of consciousness or impaired swallowing mechanisms. Infection with anaerobic bacteria, S. aureus, gram-negative enteric bacilli or S. anginosus group (previously known as S. milleri) in the presence of poor dental hygiene should be considered in that instance. A lung abscess is typically diagnosed when a chest radiograph reveals a pulmonary infiltrate with a cavity; an air-fluid level is frequently present. Better anatomic definition can be achieved with a CT scan, which can distinguish a cavitating lung lesion from a pleural collection, also a complication of CAP. It may also demonstrate previously unrecognised underlying conditions such as an aspirated foreign body, a pulmonary neoplasm, or bronchial stenosis. Most patients respond to appropriate antibiotics guided by the microbiology of the precipitating episode of CAP. If patients fail to respond to antibiotics it may be necessary to insert a pigtail drain. Antimicrobial therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate if a chronic abscess is suspected. In this instance, sputum culture is unreliable as it is contaminated by oral flora. A prolonged course of antibiotics (up to 6 weeks) may be required, although there is no evidence on the optimum duration of antimicrobial therapy. Monitoring response with serial CRP measurements may be useful in guiding the length of therapy. Percutaneous drainage of the abscess (guided by either ultrasound or CT) can be performed diagnostically and therapeutically in non-responders, and surgery is rarely required (less than 5% of cases in most series).",

With regard to the pathogenesis, it is being increasingly recognised that platelet activation may play a central role in CAPassociated AMI, raising the possibility that anti-platelet agents, such as aspirin, among many other agents, may be beneficial in preventing these events, as has been documented in at least one study in the elderly (164) (165) (166) . Furthermore, the pathogenesis of these cardiac events in pneumococcal CAP is increasingly being understood (167, 168) . It is recommended that any patients with CAP who have well-recognised risk factors for a cardiovascular event, or patients who are complicated by clinical failure, should be investigated for the possibility of a cardiovascular event. Importantly, such events, when they occur in patients with CAP, are associated with a poorer prognosis acutely, as well as a poorer prognosis and associated increased risk of cardiovascular events on long-term follow-up (169) (170) (171) .

While most cases of CAP are caused by microaspiration of relatively virulent bacteria residing in the upper respiratory tract (177), aspiration pneumonia refers to a syndrome of bacterial pneumonia in susceptible patients with defective lower airway clearance mechanisms who aspirate a large inoculum of normally nonvirulent pathogens (178, 179) . Although some features of aspiration pneumonitis and aspiration pneumonia overlap, they represent distinct clinical entities in terms of pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical manifestations and treatment. So-called 'bland' aspiration, as occurs after haematemesis or aspiration of enteral feeds, may lead to CXR infiltrates but does not result in an inflammatory response in the lung and usually resolves spontaneously without antimicrobial therapy (178, 180, 181) .

Alcohol abuse and seizures are strongly associated with anaerobic aspiration pneumonia because of reduced levels of consciousness, poor oral hygiene, immune dysfunction and delayed presentations (179) . Conditions such as dental caries, periodontal disease and gingivitis increase the risk of oropharyngeal colonisation with pathogenic organisms and a higher overall bacterial load, and are associated with a higher risk of aspiration pneumonia (173, 176, 195) . The elderly therefore represent a higher risk group (186) because of the more frequent neglect of oral hygiene (196) and higher rates of neurological disease (173) .

The most common isolates included Bacteroides melaninogenicus and other Bacteroides species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus spp. (175, 199, 200) , many of which produce beta-lactamases. The relevance of these early studies assessing the bacteriology of aspiration pneumonia has been questioned, with concerns about the sterility of sampling techniques employed (201) and the inclusion of patients with established complications such as lung abscess and empyema (173) . More recent studies using protected specimen brushes to sample the lower respiratory tract of patients with severe aspiration pneumonia isolated bacterial pathogens in a minority of cases. In these studies S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, H. influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae predominated, and no pathogenic anaerobic organisms were isolated (202, 203) . In a group of institutionalised elders with severe aspiration pneumonia who underwent bronchoscopic sampling, gram-negative enteric bacilli were the predominant organisms isolated (49%), followed by anaerobic bacteria (16%), and S. aureus (12%) (204) . This shift in microbiological profiles may reflect a true decline in anaerobic infection due to improved social conditions and access to health care, but the overlap with organisms found in health-care associated pneumonia suggests an increased occurrence of aspiration in these settings.",

This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial and in the active arm of the study, two doses of PCV7 were given to the patients 4 weeks apart. The efficacy of the vaccine for the primary endpoint, which was prevention of a further episode of vaccine serotype (or serotype 6A) pneumococcal infection, was 74% (95% CI, 30-90%). The second was a study in The Netherlands among adults >65 years which evaluated the efficacy of PCV13 in preventing first episode of vaccine type strains of community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia (primary endpoint), non-bacteremic and noninvasive pneumococcal CAP and invasive pneumococcal disease (secondary endpoints) (216) . Patients in the active arm were given one dose of PCV13.

For this reason, as well as limited duration of effectiveness, influenza vaccination is recommended to be repeated each year. Influenza vaccine usually becomes available in South Africa from March and should be given sufficiently early to provide protection for the winter season. Influenza vaccine effectiveness depends on characteristics of those being vaccinated (age and health), whether there is a good match between the circulating viruses and the viruses contained in the vaccine, and on influenza types and subtypes. In general, influenza vaccines work best among children \u22652 years and healthy adults. Older people (\u226565 years), children <2 years and severely immunocompromised individuals often have poorer immune responses to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) compared with healthy adults. However, even for these people the influenza vaccine still provides some protection. Other products, e.g., high-dose influenza vaccine and adjuvant vaccines, have been shown to be more effective in certain groups (217) but these vaccines are not available in South Africa. In the elderly, influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce the incidence of severe disease including bronchopneumonia, hospital admissions and mortality. Trivalent IIV has been shown to provide protection in HIVinfected adults without severe immunosuppression (218) . Vaccination of healthcare workers may decrease the risk of spreading influenza to their patients. Vaccinating individuals at risk of severe influenza may provide direct protection for these individuals. In addition, vaccinating individuals in close contact with people at risk for severe influenza may provide indirect protection through preventing transmission to high-risk individuals. Groups who should receive influenza vaccine are shown in Box 4.",

Most effusions are uncomplicated and resolve with treatment of the pneumonia. However, if bacteria invade the pleural space, a complicated para-pneumonic effusion or empyema results. Anaerobic utilisation of glucose by the neutrophils results in pleural fluid acidosis, and lysis of neutrophils increases the LDH concentration in the pleural fluid to values often more than 1,000 IU/L. Empyema develops when there is evidence of bacterial infection of the pleural liquid, as indicated by the presence of pus in the pleural space and/or the presence of bacterial organisms on Gram stain. A positive culture is not required for diagnosis, since there are several reasons why bacteria may not be cultured from an empyema, including the presence of anaerobic organisms in the pleural space that may be difficult to culture. The characteristic putrid odour of the pleural fluid is classically considered diagnostic of anaerobic infection.
