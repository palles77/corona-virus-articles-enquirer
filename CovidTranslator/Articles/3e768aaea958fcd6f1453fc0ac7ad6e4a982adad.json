However, the studies on these drugs are small, retrospective, uncontrolled and use different endpoints. Therefore, it remains unknown which treatment is superior. We retrospectively evaluated 68 consecutive patients treated with infliximab for aGvHD. We adhered to recently proposed guidelines for aGvHD trials and thus evaluated response on day 7 and 28. Furthermore, we assessed the composite endpoint 6 months freedom from treatment failure (6MFTF). The majority of patients had grade III-IV aGvHD. We found that 41 patients (60%) responded on day 7 and 31 patients (46%) on day 28. Twenty-four patients (35%) achieved 6MFTF. The main reasons for failure within 6 months were death (n = 31) or additional immunosuppression (n = 16). By six and 24 months, 44 and 34% of the patients were alive respectively. Patients with response to infliximab on day 7 and 28 had significantly higher overall survival (OS) probability than non-responders. We show that response on day 7 and 28 identifies high and low risk groups. Patients who fail to respond should be identified early and offered alternative therapy.",

If progression was noted in any organ or additional treatment was administered, patients were classified as having progressive disease (PD).

Marty et al. [30] previously reported increased incidence of non-Candida invasive fungal infections in patients treated with infliximab for aGvHD, which is in line with our observation of invasive Aspergillus infections. Carc\u00eda-Cadenas et al. [31] found 1-year incidence or bacterial, viral and fungal infections to be respectively 74, 65 and 14% after second-line treatment of aGvHD with anticytokine therapy. Whether patients treated with infliximab have additional, different, or more severe infections compared to other treatments, cannot be concluded from these data. Careful monitoring of the patients, including relevant sampling and clinical microbiological diagnosis as well as early, aggressive antibiotic treatment, is pivotal.",

Our results are in line with previously published reports on infliximab and other second-line therapies. Further research, preferably prospective and controlled with comparable endpoints, is warranted. Patients who fail to respond should be identified early and offered alternative therapies.",
