In this discontinuous colorimetric assay using malachite Synthesis of Bananin and Its Derivatives The bananins were synthesized by the reaction of green and ammonium molybdate, released phosphate is quantified after a 5 min reaction period, observed at phloroglucinol (most likely in its triketo tautomeric form) with aromatic aldehydes, catalyzed by hydrochloric a wavelength of 630 nm. Oligo-dT 24 was included in the assay at a saturating concentration of 200 nM, to mimic acid or sodium hydroxide in aqueous solution [9] .

The bananin group of compounds represents, to any inhibitory activity at all. These results suggest that are the double reciprocal Lineweaver Burke plots for the data in Figures 3A and 3C . In both cases, as the V max was significantly decreased in the presence of the inhibitor, but the K M changed little, this indicated that bananin was acting as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the ATPase activity of the SCV helicase with respect to both ATP and nucleic acid. This suggests that bananin inhibits by binding at a site distinct from the ATP and nucleic acid binding sites. Building on this foundation, we next tested the antihelicase activities of these compounds. We used a newly developed fluorimetric assay based on the very strong fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the fluorophore Cy3 to the quencher Black Hole Quencher 2 (BHQ2). A similar approach has been outlined very recently in assaying the hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase, a 3# to 5# helicase [34] . However, as we have recently shown that the SCV helicase holds strict 5# to 3# directionality [26] , we designed a system with a 5#-oligo(dT) overhang. The principle behind this new assay is outlined in Figure 4A . There is a Cy3 fluorophore at the 3# end of one of the oligomers of the duplex, in close proximity to a BHQ2 quencher at the 5# end of the other oligomer. When the two oligomers are in very close proximity (i.e., when the two oligomers are annealed), then the Cy3 fluorescence is strongly quenched by the FRET effect. After the duplex has been unwound by the SCV helicase, then the Cy3 fluorescence is no longer quenched, and a dramatic increase in the fluorescence may be observed. To ensure that the primers do not reanneal, a second capture primer is included in the reaction. This is identical to the BHQ2 primer but does not contain the BHQ2 quenching group, therefore the annealing process has little effect on the fluorescence of Cy3. We optimized reaction conditions to ensure that all measurements were carried out in the linear region ( Figure S2 ). As a one minute time-point was in the linear region, we then probed the larger) than the ATPase IC 50 values, it was observed that the inhibitors followed the same general trends as those observed for the ATPase data. Bananin, iodobabulky side groups on the six-membered ring of this nanin, vanillinbananin, and eubananin were effective inclass of compounds reduce their inhibitory activity hibitors of helicase activity, while ansabanin and adenagainst the SCV helicase.",

These results suggest first that bananin is an effective inhibitor with an EC 50 of below 10 \u00b5M (when measured 48 hr post-infection and when drug was added one hour after virus infection). Second, due to the increased efficacy of the drug when added post infection, these results suggest that bananin does not inhibit the entry step, but inhibits a later step of the infection cycle after the virus has penetrated the cell.
