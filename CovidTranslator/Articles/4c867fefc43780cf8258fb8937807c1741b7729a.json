The agreement includes provisions for developing bi-national cultural events to strengthen ties and promote tourism, waiving applicable visa fees for teachers and experts in the field of tourism, promoting travel to regions and developing and improving tourist facilities and attractions in regions which contain examples of native culture in each country, and conducting joint marketing activities in third countries.",

In 1974, in Lusaka, Zambia, a UNWTO budget formula and statutes were adopted allowing for the UNWTO to become an official organization the following year. Its first General Assembly was held in Madrid in May 1975, and the intervening years have seen its emergence as the key world organization for tourism. In 2003, the UNWTO achieved status as a UN-specialized agency. Its current mission statement summarizes its primary responsibility as '. . . (providing) a central and decisive role in promoting the development of responsible, sustainable and universally accessible tourism, with the aim of contributing to economic development, international understanding, peace, prosperity and universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms'. UNWTO offers national tourism administrations and organizations the machinery as a clearing house for the collection, analysis and dissemination of technical tourism information, developing partnerships between the private and public sectors, and supports the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism. Activities include facilitating international dialogue and implementation of worldwide conferences, seminars and other means for focusing on important tourism development issues and policies.

WTTC was established in 1991 by a group of chief executives from major companies within the industry to convince governments concerning travel and tourism's strategic importance. Over the past decade and a half, WTTC has worked with governments to increase understanding of the industry's economic benefits and to persuade them to re-evaluate the role of travel and tourism in their overall policy priorities.

The reasoning for this action stems from recovery measures necessitated by recent set backs experienced in the industry as a result of terrorism, war, economic slowdown and SARS. The president of WTTC, speaking at the 2003 Global Travel and Tourism Summit, stated, 'There is now a new consciousness amongst governments that they cannot leave the growth of travel and tourism to chance. What is needed is a new vision and strategy involving a partnership between all stakeholders -public and private to turn future challenges into opportunities. The Blueprint for New Tourism spells out how that can be achieved'. The guiding principles of 'New Tourism' recognize global consciousness of the importance of tourism, takes a fresh look at the opportunities and partnerships it produces and the delivery of commercially successful products that provide benefits for everyone -not just the traveller but also the local people and communities with respect to their natural, social and cultural environments.",

The OECD tourism instrument recommended minimum amounts for the import and export of national currency, for travel allowances, and for duty-free allowances for returning residents and for non-residents. It also made recommendations concerning travel documents and other formalities that strive towards facilitation of tourism. A finding then was that the most numerous and highly rated concerns among the countries responding were those impediments related to market access and the right of establishment. This reflects the importance of reaching customers in the country of residence in order to attract tourist and travel business. Without a local branch or subsidiary, travel agents, tour operators, airlines and other tourist companies are unable to market their services adequately, placing them at a competitive disadvantage.

With overall projected costs in the $200 billion range, pressure is being exerted on every agency budget and general rescissions of 2-3 per cent are possible in already approved fiscal year 2006 budgets. The public lands agencies and international tourism marketing will not be exempted from such rescissions.

Recreation industry organizations point out that this estimate only applies to visitor expenditures within 50 miles of National Parks and that it does not include billions of dollars in expenditures made farther away for recreation supplies and expensive \"durables\" such as boats, snowmobiles, skis and other durables, even though those purchases are made with the clear intent of using them on national forests. Concerns that the lower impact estimate will be used to justify a lower priority for recreation in the Forest Service budget are rejected by the agency, which points out that recreation is still the largest generator of revenue of all activities on the national forests. The validity of the FS economic impact estimates has been supported by a new study of the economic impact of wildlife refuges by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Although a much smaller impact of $1.4 billion is found for 2004, the economic assumptions and methodology are the same and the estimated impact is comparable to the FS when the smaller acreage of the National Wildlife Refuge System and fewer visitors to wildlife refuges are considered.",

Swanson Member of Southeast Tourism Policy CouncilThe Southeast Tourism Policy Council (STPC) is the government advocacy arm of the STS, a tourism industry trade association representing the interests of twelve states in the southeastern United States. While STS was established in 1983 and has long been active in governmental affairs, the STPC was formalized after the first-ever State-Federal Tourism Summit, organized by STS in 2002. Within two years after the Summit, the STPC established formal relationships with several federal agencies including the Departments of Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Army and Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Many of these relationships were formalized on February 24, 2004 at a signing ceremony held at the Department of the Interior where a Mem-Orandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between the STPC and various federal agencies. Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton observed that all of the signatories were \"strong advocates with common goals in support of public lands and the economic viability of tourism\". Below is a list of signatory organizations on the MOU. Department of Commerce -Office of Travel and Tourism Industries 4. Department of the Army -Corps of Engineers 5. Department of Transportation -Federal Highway Administration 6. Environmental Protection Agency 7. Advisory Council on Historic Preservation 8.
