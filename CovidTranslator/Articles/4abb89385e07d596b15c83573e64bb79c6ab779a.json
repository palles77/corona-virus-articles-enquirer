For a decade, he was managed for hypopituitarism due to a pituitary stalk lesion, diagnosed as optic glioma. Physical examination revealed clinical signs of cirrhosis and purpuric scalp lesions. Laboratory tests showed cholestasis and inflammation. Skin biopsy showed large cell infiltrate, staining with S-100 protein and CD1a, confirming Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). Magnetic resonance imaging with cholangiogram found moderate segmental intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and distortion, consistent with sclerosing cholangitis (SC, Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Liver biopsy revealed micronodular cirrhosis with advanced fibrosis and positive immunostaining (S-100 protein and CD1a, Fig. 1 ). Ursodeoxycholic acid and corticosteroids were begun. After few months, LCH lesions partially resolved: cholestasis and inflammation improved and pituitary lesion decreased in size ( Supplementary Fig. S2) . Conversely, liver decompensation with bleeding esophageal varices, ascites, and encephalopathy ensued, and patient was referred for transplantation (MELD score 16); however patient's condition worsened, with hepatorenal syndrome which did not improve with terlipressin treatment. Two days later MELD score was 34, and orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) was performed (Supplementary Fig. S3) ; however the patient died on post-operative day 17 from invasive aspergillosis, diagnosed through imaging and culture in bronchoalveolar lavage and serum, though treated with voriconazole.",
