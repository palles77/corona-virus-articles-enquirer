The cited articles were retrieved from computer literature searches by use of Chemical Abstracts (CA Selects), MarinLit, STN International and also NAPRALERT. Terms such as West Indian, Caribbean, gorgonian, sea whip, octocoral, and phylla names were used. The primary focus will be the structural chemistry and biological activities of the metabolites produced by a relatively small group of gorgonians found within a limited geographic area. Wherever possible, every effort was made to record the biological and pharmacological properties of new metabolites. Since marine natural products in general are often the targets of synthetic chemists, we include synthetic work, where available, on novel compounds isolated from these animals.",

All over this region the families Gorgoniidae and Rico. Their structures were defined by chemical and spectroscopic methods.

            "text": "Interestingly, seco-asbestinin derivative 35 was not cytotoxic against HeLa and CHO-KI cells, suggesting a possible role for the ten-membered ring in the cytotoxic properties of asbestinane diterpenes. A collection of B. Briareum asbestinum also produces a series of interesting, highly oxidized diterpenes called briareins, which may sometimes contain chlorine, headed by briarein A (37) . The X-ray structure of briarein A, isolated from B. asbestinum collected in Jamaica, has been reported. 33 The physical and chemical properties of briarein A as well as those for a tetraacetate monobutyrate analog of 37, briarein B (38) , which were obtained during collections of B. asbestinum from Belize 23 and Honduras, 24 have also been reported. 24 Extracts of B. asbestinum collected off the coast of Tobago, have afforded five diterpenes 39-43 that belong to the briarane class. 32 The structures of briaranes 39-43 were determined spectroscopically and that of methyl briareolate (39) , a crystalline compound, was confirmed by X-ray crystal structure. 34 Brianthein V (44) is a cytotoxic and antiviral diterpene from B. asbestinum collected near Sandy Cay, Bahamas. X-ray analysis of a suitable crystal of 44 grown from a solution of methanol furnished the absolute structure and ring conformation. 35 The variation in defensive chemistry of colonies of Briareum asbestinum, which has been recognized as one of the most ubiquitous and chemically deterrent of the Caribbean gorgonians, has been sampled. The basis of deterrence appears to reside in the diverse complement of briarane and asbestinane diterpenoids found in individual colonies. 36 The structural variability for this species has been expanded even further with the recent discovery of five new diterpenoids possessing the eunicellin ring system from B. asbestinum collected in Puerto Rico. The isolation of asbestinins, briareins, and eunicellins from the same organism supports the theory that metabolites belonging to these skeleton Detailed analysis of the spectral data and chemical correlation of briantheins X and Z established the gross structures of these highly oxidized, chlorinated diterpenes. X-ray diffraction confirmed the placement of the butyrate ester in brianthein Y and defined the absolute configuration for all three compounds. 39 Briantheins Y (46) and Z (47) have also been found in specimens ofB. asbestinum collected in the Bahamas. 35 Two additional nonchlorinated diterpenes with the briarane skeleton, brianthein-W (48) and the unnamed compound 49, were reported from the same organism shortly after. The structure of brianthein-W was defined from spectral data and X-ray diffraction studies. 40 The structure of brianthein 49 was described in 1986, but the spectral data for this metabolite were not reported. 41 Two of these compounds, brianthein Y (46) and brianthein W (48), have been tested to determine their effects on the feeding behavior of the grasshopper Melanoplus bivittatus, a major agricultural nuisance in the plain and plateau states. 40 Brianthein Y proved toxic at a high dose but inactive at a lower dose; brianthein W produced no deleterious effect at either dose. 42,43 Briantheins Y (46) and Z (47) showed viral inhibition in the in vitro mouse corona-virus assay, and 47 is also active in vitro against Herpex simplex-I virus and P338 cells. 35 Brianthein Y was quite toxic at 250 ppm when subjected to the tobacco hornworm assay.43 A unique antimicrobiai pyranone, bissetone (50) , was isolated from the very polar extracts of B. polyanthes. Spectroanalytical and chemical methods were used to develop plausible structures, but X-ray diffraction settled the correct structure and relative stereochemistry. 44 The (S,S) configuration of (-)-bissetone has been established by total synthesis from D-glucose. 45 In addition, a species of Briareum from Puerto Rico, which was identified as either B. asbestinum or B. polyanthes, contained nine new briarane diterpenes, which were named briareolides A-I (51-59). 46 Their structures were determined by spectroscopic methods, especially one-Natural products of gorgonian octocorals 4577 and two-dimensional NMR. The structure and absolute stereochemistry of briareolide B (52) were determined by X-ray analysis. 46 Some of the briareolides [A(51), B(52), C (53), D (54) , and E (55)] display antiinflammatory activity. However, these briarein type compounds, which are all nonchlorinated and highly oxygenated, were not cytotoxic against P-388 leukemia cells. All the briareolides except briareolide G (57), which has an ~x,l~unsaturated ~/-lactone, contain an ~x,13-epoxy-7-1actone, a feature found only in a few other briarane diterpenes isolated from Briareum spp. 46",

The structures of erythranes 60 and 61 were determined by X-ray analysis and from spectral data, respectively. Photochemical conversion of 61 into 60, by a di-~-methane rearrangement, helped confirm their structural relationship. 47 Erythrolides A and B along with seven additional erythrolides have been isolated from E. caribaeorum collected in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Jamaica. The structures of erythrolides C-I (62-68) were elucidated from spectroscopic dam. 46 All of these erythrolides, except erythrolide H (67) , arc chlorinated at the C-6 position. Erythrolide H (67) is unique among the compounds in this series in having a C-5,6 double bond and a 4578 A.D. RODRIGUEZ hydroxyl substituent at C-16 instead of an exocyclic C-5,16 double bond. Erythropodium caribaeorum obtained off the coast of Tobago yielded also the diterpenes erythrolide A (60), erythrolide B (61), and erythrolide E (64) along with a new diterpene, which has been designated erythrolide J (69) . The structure of 69 was determined by high-resolution NMR. 48 Erythrodiene (70), a new sesquiterpene hydrocarbon of a rare structural class, has been isolated from E. caribaeorum collected at Chub Cay, Bahamas. The structure of 70 was assigned from spectral studies and through X-ray analysis of the diol obtained during ozonolysis of erythrodiene followed by reductive work up with NaBH4. 49 Erythrodiene has been synthesized from 4-isopropylcyclohexanol in 8 steps and approximately 16% overall yield. The synthesis features a stereoselective intrarnolecular carbomercuration reaction as the key step. 50 When an extract of E. caribaeorum was incorporated into food strips, natural groups of fishes on the same reef from which the gorgonian had been collected were deterred from feeding. The feeding deterrent effects were present in a sample fraction containing erythrolides, but not in a fraction containing erythrodiene (70) . Although the erythrolides appear to defend E. caribaeorum from reef predators, the function of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons remains unclear. 51 2.3, Eunicea (family Plexauridae) Gorgonians of the common Caribbean genus Eunicea were among the first marine invertebrates to be investigated chemically with over fifteen species documented. Although common and abundant, the genus Eunicea is taxonomically complex with many species varying only slightly in form and color. Consequently, secure species assignments were difficult to make and over the years a comprehensive chemical evaluation of this group was impeded. Animals belonging to this genus are usually rich in cembrane diterpenoids.",

The I3C-NMR spectral assignments of asperdiol, 53 its synthesis, 54,55 as well as the synthesis of two plausible precursors, have been reported. 56,57 Asperketals A-F (72) (73) (74) (75) (76) (77) are diterpenes isolated from the Caribbean sea whip E. asperula collected along the offshore islands of the Tobago Cays. Compounds 72-76 are ketals and hemiketals related to the dilophol class of 10-memhered-ring diterpenoids, while asperketal F (77) belongs to the fuscol class. Their structures were assigned on the basis of chemical and spectroscopic studies. 58 In addition, the isolation of the known diterpenoid obscuronatin (78) from the same organism was reported. Further studies to determine the stereochemistry of this compound were not pursued. The stereochemistry of asperketal B (73) (89) is an elemene-type diterpene that has been isolated from the gorgonian Euniceafusca collected near South Caicos, W.I. 62 Although the data collected did not permit unequivocal assignment of the stereochemistry at C-4 in fuscol, the isolation of ketone 90 from the same animal implies that the side chain should be equatorial. An E configuration could be assigned to the disubstituted double bond. However, the geometry of the trisubstituted double bond could not be specified in the original report although it was later assigned as E. 63 Their structures were elucidated by combined spectra and chemical methods and in that study the researchers established that the structure of palominol should be revised from 97 to 102. 68 A brine shrimp assay, which was used as a simple lethality test to screen for biological activity in palominol, produced a 0% death response at an initial concentration of 30 I.tg/mL after a 24 hour count period. When screened for antimicrobial activity palominol was found to inhibit weakly the growth of Gram negative bacteria. 67 Palominol also displayed modest cytotoxic activity (IC50 = 10 I.tg/mL) against the human colon (HCT 116) cell line. 69 Isopalominol (103) Specimens collected at Jamaica and the Florida Keys contain (+)-o~-muurolene (112) ",

The crystal structure and absolute configuration of the acetate derivative of plexaurolone were determined from three-dimensional X-ray diffraction data. 120 Plexaurolone (178) may represent the first example of a Caribbean cembranoid belonging to the or-series. Later data, however, suggested that the PGA2 of P. homomaUa is not used to compete allelopathically or to reduce fouling, but to provide protection from predators. 140 Interestingly, during a re-evaluation of the ichthyodeterrent role of prostaglandins in P. homomalla, it was found that the consumption of food strips containing the acetoxy methyl ester of (15R)-PGA2 did not differ from consumption of control strips when presented to a natural assemblage of Caribbean coral reef fishes. However, treatment with the acetoxy acid, hydroxy methyl ester, and hydroxy acid of (15R)-PGA2 inhibited consumption of food strips by reef fishes. Although the results of the latter study suggest that the esterified prostaglandins present in P. homomalla do not deter fish predators, these compounds may have very different effects on other potential predators of gorgonians, particularly invertebrates. 141,142 The mechanism of biosynthesis of prostaglandins of the A and E series from P. homomalla, which clearly follows a distinct pathway from the mammalian cyclooxygenase/endoperoxide route, has been the subject of intense research. 143-147 A major discussion of the chemistry and chemical ecology of Plexaura homomalla appeared in 1992. 9",

The total synthesis of (+)-crassin acetate methyl ether has also been reported. 163 Crassin acetate (200) , which may constitute as much as 1.5-2% of the dry weight of the cortex of the gorgonian P. porosa, functions in the marine ecosystem, along with other related compounds, by decreasing the viability of ciliated larvae of organisms which compete with gorgonians for space.t64, 165 Recently, two additional cytotoxic antitumor diterpenoids of the cembrane class related to crassin acetate, named 14-deoxycrassin (207) and pseudoplexaurol (208) , were isolated from a specimen of P. porosa The first successful synthetic approach to a pseudopterane, viz., 213, was reported. 169 A retrosynthetic strategy for the total synthesis of pseudopterolide (212) and allied pseudopteranes has been reported. 170,171 Several routes to the 2,5-furanocyclic ring system of the pseudopterane family of natural products along with prototype pseudopterane and furanocembrane systems have recently been described. 172-176 A collection of a Pseudopterogorgia spp. from Belize, whose spicule analyses closely related the animal to the Caribbean sea whip P. acerosa, produces exclusively the sesquiterpene 12-hydroxy-E-'pbisabolene (214) . The structure of this alcohol was based upon spectral analyses and chemical interconversions. 177 Tobagolide (215) is a nitrogenous pseudopterane derivative from a Tobago specimen of P. acerosa. 2D-NMR spectroscopy was used to establish the structure of tobagolide as the dimethylamino derivative 215.178 Pseudopterolide (212) can be transformed efficiently into tobagolide (215) by reaction with dimethylamine. Sequential treatment of tobagolide with methyl iodide and sodium hydride results in intramolecular SN' displacement with reconstruction of pseudopterolide. 179,180 Two collections of P. acerosa from Tobago produced mixtures of acids that were esterified with diazomethane to obtain deoxypseudopterolide (216) and acerosolide (217) in the former collection and tobagolide (215) in the latter collection. The reported structural assignments for the pseudopterane 216 and the cembrane 217 were devoid of relevant stereochemistry and depended heavily on 2D-NMR spectroscopy. 181",

A number of these compounds have offered special opportunities for advancing basic science and laying a foundation for new research. For instance, determining the natural functions of these secondary metabolites is currently an issue of more broad interest. Most marine scientists are now convinced about the defensive roles of these compounds and many suspect that they may have contributed to the evolutionary success of the producing organisms (the ecological roles of the majority of these compounds, however, have yet to be clearly dermed). Their interest, coupled with the demonstration of potent feeding deterrence, has added a new dimension to gorgonian biology. Moreover, metabolites isolated from West Indian gorgonians are frequently the subjects of biochemical and biosynthetic investigations. Some of these compounds have already found application as probes for new mechanisms of action, and a selected few may soon be found under development as pharmaceutical agents (i.e. the pseudopterosins are currently in clinical evaluation for topical skin diseases and fuscosides A (91) and B (92) are of possible interest. At this time, however, there are no other compounds isolated from West Indian gorgonians in preclinical study or in clinical evaluation). 235 The majority of the species of gorgonians listed by Bayer (about 80%) 1 are not easily available as chemical targets, since they are either extremely rare or occur very deep. As a result, the emphasis of those already involved in the isolation of new compounds and those who may choose to enter this field, should inevitably move to the study of gorgonians that are rare or difficult to collect. The emphasis on new directions is well justified for it is becoming increasingly difficult to find new compounds from those specimens that are too obvious or easily collected using SCUBA. Notwithstanding, the recent literature provides confidence that many gorgonian species from the West Indian region will continue to yield fascinating and previously undescribed secondary metabolites with potent pharmacological activity. One can comfortably predict not only that the natural products isolated from these marine invertebrates will provide a rich source of biologically active compounds of medicinal importance but, even more importantly, that they will provide models on which to base extensive synthetic programs leading to still more efficacious pharmaceuticals.

A highly stereo-and enantioselective total synthesis of (+)-sarcophytol A (183) has been described, which could in principle be modified to obtain also (-)-sarcophytol A (182). 123-126 The synthesis of (+)-sarcophytol A benzyl ether has also been reported. and Spraggins reported the occurrence of relatively large quantities of two prostaglandin derivatives in the gorgonian Plexaura homomalla from coastal waters off Florida. 128 These compounds, 15-epi-PGA2 (185) and its diester 186, present in the air dried cortex to the extent of 0.2% and 1.3%, repectively, are epimefic with the potent hormones found in mammalians at the allylic hydroxyl center.They are devoid of the dramatic blood pressure lowering effect in dogs of PGA2 itself. Most of the structure determination work was based on spectral data and chemical modifications, and was performed with the diester 186.128-130 These (15R)-prostaglandins, themselves possessed of no dramatic biological activity, were however, used as starting materials for the preparation of (15S)-prostaglandins such as PGE2, PGF2a and other closelyrelated highly active prostaglandins. 131-133 Plexaura homomaUa collected in other locations throughout the Caribbean region has yielded prostaglandins with the (15S)-configuration [i.e. (15S)-PGA2 (187), its methyl ester 188, and (15S)-PGE2 methyl ester (189)]. 134 Also, both (15R)-and (15S)-prostaglandins may occur in some single specimens of this gorgonian. During the chromatographic purification of (15S)-PGA2 obtained from P. homomalla, another natural prostaglandin, 5-trans-PGA2 (190), was detected. Its structure was elucidated on the basis of spectral data and confirmed by chemical transformations. 135 The isolation and characterization of (15R)and (15S)-prostaglandins A2 and their esters from P. homomalla collected at Grand Cayman and the Florida Keys, have been described. 136 Small amounts of derivatives of prostaglandins (15R)-PGE2 (191) andPGF2a(192) were also reported. P. homomalla forma kiikenthali, collected in Puerto Rico, yielded 50% of its weight as the mammalian prostaglandin (15S)-PGA2 methyl ester(188). The freeze-dried gorgonian yielded (15S)-PGA2 largely as the acetate of the methyl ester. 137 PGF2a-9-O-acetate methyl ester(193) was found as a natural product in extracts of P. homomalla collected in the Bahamas Islands. The structure of this prostaglandin derivative was assigned on the basis of spectral analysis. 138 Experiments performed underwater at Curacao have shown that both (15R)-PGA2(185)and (15S)-PGA2 (187) induce vomiting in fishes, which quickly learned aversion to pellets containing PGA2. Thus, it was speculated that the PGA2 of P. homomalla can serve as an effective defense against most predatory reef fish.

The biosynthesis of preclavulone-A from arachidonic acid involves a process that contrasts sharply with the mammalian (endoperoxide) route. Preclavulone-A may be a key intermediate from which other more highly oxygenated, bioactive marine prostanoids are formed. 143 Subsequent studies revealed that the Caribbean coral species Plexaura homomalla, Plexaura nina, Plexaura flexuosa, Pseudopterogorgia americana, Muriceopsis flavida, and Eunicea asperula have all been found to convert arachidonate to 8-R-HPETE (210) and preclavulone-A (209) demonstrating that this route to marine prostanoids is widespread among such corals. .

Pseudopterogorgia species are among the most common of the Caribbean species with over fifteen species documented. Chemical studies of Pseudopterogorgia species began in 1968, with investigations of the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons from the most common representative of this genus, Pseudopterogorgia americana. A. Pseudopterogorgia acerosa (Pallas) (Purple sea plume, Dry sea plume) Pseudopterolide (212) was isolated by conventional chromatographic methods from the extract of Pseudopterogorgia acerosa collected in the Florida Keys. The structure of 212 was determined by X-ray analysis of the cyclic p-bromophenylurethane derivative obtained in two steps from pseudopterolide. 168 Pseudopterolide inhibits overall cell cleavage but does not inhibit nuclear division in the fertilized urchin egg assay. Although pseudopterolide can be dissected symmetrically into two geranyl units in two possible ways (perhaps suggesting a biogenesis involving dimerization) the prevalence of the 14-membered ring cembranoids in marine soft corals suggests a mechanism involving ring contraction.",

Bipinnatins A (244), B (245) and D (247) are active in vitro against P388 murine tumor cell lines with ICs0's of 0.9, 3.2 and 1.5 ~tg/mL, respectively. Bipinnatin C (246), which lacks the \u00a2t,[~-unsaturated carbonyl functionality, is much less active, with an IC50 of 46.6 [tg/mL. 201 Curiously, cembranes 244, 245, and 246, along with related derivatives bipinnatin E (248) and bipinnatin F (249), all lophotoxin (250) analogs from a Pseudopterogorgia sp., had been reported in 1985 by the Fenical group but their structures were not proposed nor their physical and chemical data reported. 202 They found then that one of these analogs, 245, was equipotent as lophotoxin (250) for inhibition of [125I]-ct-toxin binding to intact cells and, notably, also blocked ix-toxin binding to detergent-extracted receptor. Furthermore, 245 inhibited [125I]-ct-toxin binding to receptor-rich membrane fragments prepared from Torpedo electric organ, a preparation in which lophotoxin was inactive. Structure-activity relationships exhibited by these lophotoxin congeners suggest mechanisms for covalent binding to the receptor by way of a Michael addition or by Schiff base formation.202, 203 These lophotoxins are also unique in that they irreversibly inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by forming a covalent bond with a tyrosine residue at position 190 in the ct-subunit of the receptor.204,205, 206 The bimolecular reaction constants for the interaction of the bipinnatins with the nicotinic receptor decreased in the order bipinnatin B > bipinnatin A > bipinnatin C for the acetylcholine-binding sites. 204 Although additional lophotoxin analogs have been reported [i.e. bipinnatins G (251), H (252), and I (253), as well as bipinnatolide-B (254)], their structures have not been proposed nor their physical and chemical datareported. Bipinnatin E and F (along with bipinnatins A, B, and C) were isolated from P. bipinnata collected in the Bahamas and bipinnatin G, H, and I were isolated from an unidentified species of Pseudopterogorgia . 203 A concise synthesis of the furan-containing macrocyclic (cembranoid) ring system found in lophotoxin (250) and other members of this family of irreversible nicotinic receptor antagonists, . Pseudopterogorgla elisabethae (spec. nov.) The Caribbean sea whip Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae collected in the central Bahamas Islands, was found to contain the pseudopterosins A-D (255-258), a new class of natural products which can be characterized as diterpene-pentose-glycosides. The pseudopterosins possess antiinflammatory and analgesic properties that exceed the potencies of existing drugs such as indomethacin. An X-ray-crystallographic study, together with degradation to obtain D-xylose, gave the structure of pseudopterosin C (257), to which pseudopterosins A (255), B (256), and D (258) were related by chemical interconversion.",

The structures of the seco-pseudopterosins were suggested on the basis of comprehensive spectral analyses and upon chemical transformations.

The Greater Antilles (Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and Jamaica) lying not far from the center of the region, are within the area where the greatest variety of species occurs. Although up to the present time these islands are credited with about 53 species 1, a little less than one third of those of the entire region, yet it is probable that future collecting will eventually demonstrate that a large majority of the other West Indian and Atlantic gorgonians occur also along their shores. The unprecedented structures obtained from the approximately 20% of West Indian gorgonians studied thus far constitute ample evidence that these animals are an important source of new classes of bioactive metabolites. These marine invertebrates are responsible for the production of over twenty different skeletal classes of terpenes with unique substitution patterns and functionalities. An example of both diversity and antipodal nature of West Indian gorgonian sesqui-and diterpenoid metabolites are those isolated from Eunicea and Plexaura octocorals. They are also the source of prostaglandins, sterols, carotenoids, and intriguing metabolites of mixed biogenesis. A chemical class distribution of the gorgonian natural products compiled in this Report, shows some interesting trends. The principal terpenoids elaborated by West Indian gorgonians are diterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Diterpenoids as a single class, represent the largest percentage of natural products isolated from these animals accounting for 73.5% of the approximately 290 metabolites reported from 1958 to December 1994.",
