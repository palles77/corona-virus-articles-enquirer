            "text": "The concept that animal health and the environment influence human health has been around since ancient times. Indeed, the initial mission of veterinary medicine was to benefit human health by improving the food supply. In the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, leaders in medicine such as Drs. Rudolf Virchow and William Osler embraced the concept that human health and animal health were inextricably linked. 1 As the 20 th century progressed, collaboration between medicine and veterinary medicine waned. In the 21 st century, the emergence of deadly zoonotic diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and West Nile virus, present the urgent need that these professions renew and increase collaborative efforts.",

Lancisi recommended that ill and suspect animals be destroyed. In order to put Lancisi's principles into effect, the first veterinary medical school in the world was established in Lyon, France. 2 Virchow and Osler continued these cross-disciplinary efforts. Early in his academic medical career, Virchow conducted animal experiments such as the study of the life cycle of Trichinella spiralis in porcine muscular tissue and cysticercosis and tuberculosis in cattle; he coined the term \"zoonosis.\" 3 His efforts helped lead to regular meat inspections by veterinarians in Europe and eventually in the United States. In 1873, Osler, who had recently received his medical degree from McGill University, left Canada to study with Virchow in Berlin. Virchow impressed upon the young Osler the importance of the autopsy and of scientific inquiry in the practice of medicine. Osler returned to Canada in 1874, where he established veterinary pathology as an academic discipline in a North American school of veterinary medicine. 4",

Schwabe, the late veterinary epidemiologist and parasitologist at the University of California, Davis, coined the term \"One Medicine,\" which promoted a unified medical and veterinary medical approach against zoonotic diseases. This strategy is important because there have been recent emerging zoonotic disease outbreaks, including the Nipah virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and avian influenza (A) H5N1, that are spreading across Asia, Africa, and Europe. Reasons for the emergence of these zoonotic diseases include: intensive agricultural practices, global trade in exotic animals, consumption of \"bush meat,\" and human population pressures. We must anticipate many more zoonotic disease outbreaks \"emerging\" in the future.",

Doherty, a physician and veterinarian, respectively, discovered how the immune system distinguishes normal cells from virus-infected cells.

Visionary leaders and educators of medicine embraced the fact that zoonotic pathogens infect both humans and animals and, as a result, they encouraged their physician colleagues to work closely with their veterinary medical colleagues. On June 25 th , 2007, the American Medical Association House of Delegates approved a \"One Health\" resolution, which promotes the partnership between human and veterinary medicine. The American Veterinary Medical Association set up a task force of prominent veterinarians, physicians, and allied health scientists in July 2007. It was charged with developing strategies to implement the \"One Health\" concept. These are important steps toward our understanding of how to control, and ultimately, prevent zoonotic disease transmission, which would improve the health and lives of both animals and humans. Schools of medicine, veterinary medicine, and public health should embrace the \"One Health\" concept and prepare their students to meet the challenges of the future.",
