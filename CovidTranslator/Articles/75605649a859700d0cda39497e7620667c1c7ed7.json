Interestingly, it appears to be a disease that predominantly affects adults while the mortality in children is extremely low. However, the pathogenesis of SARS in relation to different characteristics relevant to age remains unclear. Material and Methods: To better understand the role of cytokines in the immunopathological processes of SARS, weanling (4 weeks old), young (6 weeks old) and adult (10 weeks old) male BALB/C mice were inoculated intranasally with N-protein of SARS-CoV in this study. Serum or lung homogenate levels of some cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interferon-g (IFN-g) along with acute injury lung index and histology were also analyzed. Results: Histopathological analysis of adult male BALB/ C mice after N-protein infection showed progressive inflammatory reactions, especially pulmonary edema, in accordance with a moderately (~13 %) elevated level of W/D ratio at 24 h. Although adult groups underwent a progressive lung inflammation in the acute phase accompanied by raised levels of TNF-a in serum, no significant changes in lung TNF-a level were reported simultaneously. Moreover, adult SARS infected BALB/c mice showed elevated levels of IFN-g while IFN-g levels in weanling and young groups had no obvious association with lung inflammation. Conclusion: Our study supports the observation that adult mice do have progressively greater immune reactions than weanling and adolescent ones over time. The relative immaturity of the immune system in weanlings may confer benefit leading to less impairment of lung function. However, the measurement of TNF-a and IFNg levels was not indicative of the severity of lung injury at the early stage of disease.",

It is a new infectious disease with a significant morbidity and mortality, whose major clinical features include persistent fever, chills/rigor, myalgia, malaise, dry cough, headache, and dyspnoea. Interestingly, when it wreaked havoc in China, South East Asia and other parts of the world in 2003, it appeared to be a disease that predominantly affects adults. Less than 10 % of those infected were children. Among the affected children, only 5 % required admission to an intensive care unit, and less than 1 % required mechanical ventilation. No deaths were reported among children affected by SARS [1] . Different features in children have led some to believe that SARS is a relatively mild disease in this age group. A novel coronavirus has been identified as the pathogen responsible for SARS [2] . However, the pathogenesis of SARS involving different characters relevant to age remains unclear and there is no efficient treatment for SARS so far.",

Among all the coronavirus proteins, the N protein is the most abundant throughout infection at both mRNA and protein levels [4] .

It has been shown that many proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interferon-g (IFN-g) take part in the occurrence and development of ALI and ARDS, and the therapy, aimed directly at cytokines has achieved initial effects [8] . TNF-a has been shown to be elevated in bronchopulmonary secretions of patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome [9] , and to cause a pulmonary inflammatory reaction when administered intravenously or directly into the lungs of animals [10] . Although the production of TNF-a was found to increase and correlate positively with severity in H5N1 infections [11] and swine pneumonia [12] , other studies showed that plasma TNF-a was not elevated in SARS patients [13, 14] , which suggested that the hosts immune reaction to the novel coronavirus might be dif- ferent from the immune reaction to other pathogens. Besides, imbalance of Th1/Th2 cytokine profile confirmed the SARS-CoV induced Th1 predominance as all SARS patients exhibited a significant increase in the typical antiviral Th1 cytokine IFN-g and an array of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-12) [13] . Other studies showed that chemokines such as IFN-g-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and monokine induced by interferon-g were substantially boosted soon after the onset of fever in pediatric cases [17] . However, there is still some controversy or uncertainty about the expression pattern of cytokines in the development of SARS, especially in the early stage of the disease among different ages.",

BALB/c mice, small and accessible, infected with N-protein of SARS-CoV which have been evaluated extensively at the immunological level by several labs as a possible animal model for SARS [18, 19, 20] . It seems that the route of inoculation was a key factor to demonstrate SARS-CoV replication in mice. Subbarao et al. [20] demonstrated that SARS-CoV does infect BALB/c mice by intranasal inoculation. Mice exhibited mild and focal peribronchiolar mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, with no significant pathology in other organs. A previous study [21] confirmed that animals showed acute lung injury 6 hours after inoculating with Nprotein, which suggested that mice infected by N-protein can mimick the immunopathological processes of SARS in the short term. In our study, inflammatory and histopathological changes in lungs were present in some animals just 2 hours following administration. In general, humans exhibit more mature lungs at birth than rodents. Alveolarization in rodents occurs exclusively from Days 4 to 14 after birth and thoracic growth and alveolarization persist throughout life. Mice are weaned at approximately 4 weeks old when the alveolar wall has been formed and testes of male mice have dropped to the scrotum at about 50 days old [30, 31] . In our study, BALB/C mice at the age of 4,6,10 weeks old were chosen in analogy to the periods of childhood, adolescent and adult in human respectively.",

Lung inflammation caused by SARS-CoV is likely a complex pathophysiological process involving inflammatory cytokines released from activated macrophages in alveoli, leading to immune system dysregulation. The predominant pathology in the lungs of patients infected with SARS-CoV has been demonstrated as diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) [32] . In this study, histopathological analysis of adult male BALB/C mice after N-protein infection showed progressive inflammatory reactions, especially pulmonary edema, in accordance with a moderately (~13 %) elevated level of W/D ratio at 24 hours. Loss of cilia, denudation of the bronchiolar epithelium, and luminal deposition of fibrin provided evidence of more severe injury to the bronchiolar epithelium in adult than in weanling and young mice. Interestingly, we observed that pulmonary inflammation and congestion occurred immediately after intranasal inoculation of N-protein in weanling groups and recurrence was found at 24 hours after a period of relief. We also found lung injury became progressively worse at 6 hours in young groups, but it lessened after that. However, no significant differences in either W/D ratio and histopathological scores were seen between control and infected mice of weanling and young groups except at 6 hours in young. Some reports [25] in- dicated that the inflammation of lung would become aggravated again in some patients, being named the \"second peak\". One possible explanation was attribueted to the secondary virema. Others have proposed that the secondary immune response related to the infection of virus may play an important role [26] . Mice in weanling groups underwent similar processes which were different from the other two groups, suggesting acute immunopathological development of disease at an early stage in the weanling. Further time points need to be assessed to investigate whether older groups have the same processes over time.",

Interestingly, the progression levels of TNF-a in serum of adult SARS patients were reported by the Beijing group of National Research Project for SARS [15] . Our results showed the levels of TNF-a in focal lung tissue at young groups were much higher than in the other two groups at the early stage of disease while young groups presented a relatively severe transient circumscribed lung injury only at 6 hours. Although adult groups underwent a progressive lung inflammation in the acute phase accompanied by raised levels of TNF-a in serum, no significant changes in lung TNF-a level were reported simultaneously. This raised the questioned of whether the measurement of TNF-a level reflected the severity of lung injury at the early stage of SARS.",

It has been proven that the levels of IFN-g and some proinflammatory cytokines were significantly advanced in the early stage of SARS and even decreased in the convalescence stage [13, 14] . In our study, adult SARS infected BALB/c mice showed elevated levels of IFN-g, suggesting that the proinflammatory cytokine response may be responsible for SARS-associated events [24] . However, IFN-g levels in weanling and young groups have no obvious association with lung inflammation. Possible reasons proposed include that weanling mice were not able to mount a hei-ghtened mature immune response as seen in adults during the immune deregulation phase of SARS and thus less organ damage ensued with its associated morbidity and mortality [22] . It was also confirmed by our research that the increment of W/D ratio in weanling groups was not as significant as that of in adult groups. In addition, Leung CW, et al. [23] posed the viewpoint that children in general presented with less comorbidity than adults and this may contribute to low mortality in children.
