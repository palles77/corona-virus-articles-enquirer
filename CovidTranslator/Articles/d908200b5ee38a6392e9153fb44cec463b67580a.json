LANGERHANS Figure 1 | Immune-response elements in non-inflamed skin. Human skin is composed of three distinct compartments relevant to its immune functions. First, the epidermis is composed of keratinized epithelial cells and functions as both a physical barrier and an early warning system. Immune cells resident in the epidermis include specialized dendritic cells (DCs) known as Langerhans cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes. Second, the dermis is mainly composed of connective tissue produced by dermal fibroblasts. Immune system cells resident in non-inflamed dermis include dermal DCs, mast cells and a small number of cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA)-positive memory T cells. Third, dermal post-capillary venules constitutively express low levels of E-selectin, CC-chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1). These support the margination and baseline emigration of CLA + memory T cells into non-inflamed skin.

Adaptive immune surveillance addresses the logistical challenge faced by the immune system in getting the right T cell to the right place at the right time. At the skin interface, this process can be viewed as operating at three levels, which we term primary, secondary and tertiary immune surveillance (FIG. 4) . Primary immune surveillance incorporates the mechanisms for bringing environmental antigens that are encountered in the skin, professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and naive T cells together in the specialized microenvironment of skin-draining lymph nodes. Secondary immune surveillance, in turn, involves the production and distribution of antigen-specific effector memory T cells expressing homing receptors that direct their migration to the tissue where antigen was encountered. Tertiary immune surveillance encompasses the long-term elements of the acquired immune response, including the production of central memory and effector cells that are potentially directed to tissues other than the site of primary exposure. Each of these modes of immune surveillance is a strategy used by the immune system to improve the odds that each T cell will find the antigen for which its T-cell receptor (TCRs) is specific and develop effective responses: first, by increasing the efficiency with which naive T cells are exposed to antigens; second, by targeting the effector response to the most appropriate tissue site; and third, by expanding coverage to other tissues.",

More recently, immunobiological therapy has come to the forefront in this disease, with reports of polarizing therapies such as IL-4, IL-10 and IL-11, which inhibit T HELPER 1 (TH1) CELLS and/or enhance TH2-CELL functions, showing promise [97] [98] [99] . Other biological agents that inhibit T-cell recruitment or activation, including alefacept (an LFA3immunoglobulin fusion protein), efalizumab (a humanized antibody specific for CD11a) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4)-immunoglobulin fusion protein have shown efficacy in clinical trials; with alefacept and efalizumab recently winning FDA approval 100 . Biological agents that inhibit TNF are also quite effective -etanercept is a p75 TNF receptor-IgG Fc fusion protein and infliximab is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for TNF. Both of these compounds have been shown to be effective in the treatment of psoriasis 101 . Interestingly, short-term treatment with an antibody specific for E-selectin was recently shown to be ineffective in psoriasis, indicating that once lesions are established, blocking T-cell rolling on E-selectin is insufficient to block disease activity 102 . By contrast, Efomycin M -a small molecule inhibitor of selectin binding -has recently been shown to be effective in animal models of psoriasis and might indicate a further role for inhibition of selectins in the treatment of human psoriasis 103 .",

This leads to the activation of resident T cells and the recruitment of CLA + T cells from the blood, including the presumed subpopulation that is specific for psoriatic autoantigens.

A general model in which allergen-specific type 1 CD4 + and CD8 + T cells act as effectors and type 2 CD4 + T cells act as regulatory elements is supported by investigations in animal models 117 . Accumulation of eosinophils and enhanced production of IgE can also be seen 118 . ACD requires a sensitization phase of 1-2 weeks after exposure, in which small molecule components of the active agent bind to endogenous proteins and act as haptens to induce the activation and proliferation of antigen-specific T cells, which then mature into skin-homing effector memory cells.

The production of IL-18 is increased in atopic dermatitis 159 , and keratinocytes from patients with atopic dermatitis produce a different array of cytokines and chemokines than do keratinocytes from non-atopic individuals 160-162 . Protocols to enhance DC migration to peripheral lymph nodes are under investigation 149 . It is also important to consider the effects of vaccination strategies on DC activation, as antigen presentation by immature DCs has been shown to stimulate antigen-specific inhibition of effector T-cell functions 93, 150 .",

            "text": "Investigation of leukocyte trafficking to the skin has provided insight into the role of primary, secondary and tertiary immune surveillance in normal cutaneous immune function and in the development of inflammatory skin diseases. The few disorders that we have discussed in detail are only a subset of clinically important T-cell-mediated skin diseases, which also include drug eruptions, alopecia areata, lichen planus and many others. The number and diversity of these diseases are testament to how many things can potentially go wrong in a complex system such as cutaneous immune surveillance. At the same time, it is extraordinary that the cutaneous immune system works as well as it does most of the time. The concept that exaggerated or inappropriate activity of an important immune-surveillance mechanism can cause organ-specific diseases might extend to inflammatory bowel disease and asthma, which occur at two other epithelial-cell interfaces with the environment. The challenge will be to design therapies that target the elements of cutaneous immune surveillance that are overactive in specific diseases of the skin or other organs, while leaving intact those functions that are central to survival in a hostile world filled with opportunistic pathogens. reaction, sometimes resulting in partial tumour destruction [126] [127] [128] . Clonal expansion of T cells occurs in regressing primary melanoma, and lymphocytes explanted from such lesions are cytotoxic in vitro to autologous melanoma cells [129] [130] [131] [132] . Although a rapid lymphocytic infiltrate in the vertical growth phase (where rapid growth and prominent dermal invasion occur) of primary melanoma occurs less frequently, this response is correlated with prolonged survival and a reduced incidence of metastatic disease [133] [134] [135] .",

In the development of such protocols, relatively little attention has been paid to the route of vaccination used [145] [146] [147] . We would predict that immunization through the skin would generate a skin-homing effector T-cell response, but might not be expected to target metastatic tumours in the lungs or gastrointestinal tract efficiently. Under normal circumstances, antimelanoma T-cell responses might first be expected to develop in the local skin-draining lymph nodes and should lead to the generation of skin-homing memory effector cells. Indeed, IL-2 therapy (which expands and activates pre-existing memory effector cell populations) and DC vaccine therapies result in more rapid responses to the cutaneous metastases of melanoma than to metastases elsewhere 148 . For immunization with melanoma-antigen-pulsed DCs, if they are injected into the skin, they could traffic through afferent lymphatics to draining lymph nodes, generating skin-homing memory effector cells. Injected intravenously, however, their migration patterns remain largely unknown.",
