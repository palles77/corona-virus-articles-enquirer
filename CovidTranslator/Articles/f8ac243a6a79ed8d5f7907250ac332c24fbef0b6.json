Clinical microbiology tends to rely on often largely ad hoc taxonomical nomenclature, such as biochemical serovars for Salmonella enterica or mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRUs) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. While the rich information contained in WGS should in principle allow superseding traditional taxonomic classifications [6, 7] , defining an intuitive, meaningful and rigorous classification for genome sequences represents a major challenge. For strictly clonal species, which undergo no horizontal gene transfer (HGT), such as M. tuberculosis, it is possible to devise a 'natural' robust phylogenetically based classification [8] . Unfortunately, organisms undergoing regular HGT, and with a significant accessory genome, do not fall neatly into existing classification schemes. In fact, it is even questionable whether a completely satisfactory classification scheme could be devised for such organisms, as classifications based on the core genome, accessory genome, housekeeping genes (MLST), genotypic markers, plasmid sequence, virulence factors or AMR profile may all produce incompatible categories ( Figure 1 ).",

In principle, WGS offers the possibility to predict the full resistance profile to multiple drugs (the 'resistome'). Possibly the first real attempt to predict the resistome from WGS data was a study by Holden et al. in 2013, showing that, for a large dataset of S. aureus ST22 isolates, 98.8% of all phenotypic resistances could be explained by at least one previously documented AMR element or mutation in the sequence data [9] .",

            "text": "Since then, several tools have been developed for the prediction of resistance profiles from WGS. These include those designed for prediction of resistance phenotype from acquired AMR genes, including ResFinder [10] and ABRicate (https://github.com/tseemann/abricate), together with those also taking into account point mutations in chromosome-borne genes such as Arg-Annot [11] , the Sequence Search Tool for Antimicrobial Resistance (SSTAR) [12] , and the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) [12] . Of these, ResFinder and CARD can be implemented as online methods that, dependent on user traffic, can be considerably slower than most other tools that only use the command-line. They are, however, superior in terms of broad usability and are more intuitive than, for example, the Glossary Accessory genome: the variable genome consisting of genes that are present only in some strains of a given species. Many of the organisms representing the most severe AMR threats are characterised by large accessory genomes containing important components of clinically relevant phenotypic diversity. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR): the ability of a microorganism to reproduce in the presence of a specific antimicrobial compound. Also referred to as antibiotic resistance (ABR or AR). The sum of the detected AMR genes in a sequenced isolate is sometimes referred to as the resistome. Horizontal gene tranfer (HGT): the transmission of genetic material laterally between organisms outside 'vertical' parent-to-offspring inheritance, including across species boundaries. Genetic elements related to clinically relevant phenotypes such as AMR and virulence are often transmitted via HGT. K-mer: a string of length k contained within a larger sequence. For example, the sequence 'ATTGT' contains two 4-mers: 'ATTG' and 'TTGT'. The analysis of the k-mer content of raw sequencing reads allows for rapid characterization of the genetic difference between isolates without the need for genome assembly. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST): a scheme used to assign types to bacteria based on the alleles present at a defined set of chromosome-borne housekeeping genes. Also referred to as sequence typing (ST). Phylogenetic tree: a representation of inferred evolutionary relationships based on the genetic differences between a set of sequences. Also referred to as a phylogeny. Transmission chain: the route of transmission of a pathogen between hosts during an outbreak. This can often be characterized using WGS compared to traditional epidemiological inference based on, for example, tracing contacts between patients. Virulence: broadly, a pathogen's ability to cause damage to its host, for example through invasion, adhesion, immune evasion, and toxin production. However, virulence is currently loosely defined by indirect proxies either phenotypically (e.g., through serum-killing assays) or genetically (e.g., by the presence of genes involved in capsule synthesis or hypermucosvisity). Whole-genome sequencing (WGS): the process of determining the complete nucleotide sequence of an organism's genome. This is generally achieved by 'shotgun' sequencing of short reads that are either assembled de novo or mapped onto a high-quality reference genome. graphical user interface of SSTAR. Other tools exist for richer species-specific characterization such as PhyResSE [13] and PATRIC-RAST [14] . Further tools have been developed to predict phenotype directly from unassembled sequencing reads, bypassing genome assembly [15, 16] .",

One major challenge is that virulence is often a context-dependent trait. For example, in K. pneumoniae various imperfect proxies for virulence are used. These include capsule type, hypermucovisity, biofilm and siderophore production, or survival in serum-killing assays. While all of these traits are quantifiable and reproducible, and could thus in principle be predicted using WGS, it remains unclear how well they correlate with virulence in the patient.

Available tools tend to be sophisticated and complex to implement, and the sequence data needs extremely careful quality control and curation. Unfortunately, in some cases insufficient genetic variation will have accumulated over the course of an outbreak, and a transmission chain simply cannot be inferred without this signal [57, 58] . Furthermore, extensive within-host genetic diversity (typical in chronic infections) can render the inference of transmission chains intractable [59] .

In a hospital setting, surveillance can help to detect transmission within the hospital and inflow from the community, optimize antimicrobial stewardship, and inform treatment decisions; at national and global scales, it can highlight worldwide emerging trends for which collated evidence can direct both retrospective but also anticipatory policy decisions.",

Another popular tool for the sharing of data and visualization of phylogenetic trees and their accompanying meta-data is Microreact (microreact.org) [61] , which also allows for interactive data querying and includes bacteria and fungi. A further tool, predominately for bacterial data, is WGSA (www.wgsa.net).

This is a misunderstanding as one cannot simply extrapolate the cost of a bacterial genome by multiplying a highthroughput per DNA megabase (Mb) sequencing cost by the size of its genome. For microbial sequencing, multiple samples must be multiplexed for cost efficiency, which is easier to achieve in large reference laboratories with high sample turnover.

Realistic cost estimates for a microbial genome including library preparation on the best available platforms give a different picture ( Figure 2B ). Since the introduction of the Illumina MiSeq platform in 2011, new sequencing kits generating higher output have only marginally affected true microbial genome sequencing costs, as library preparation makes up a significant portion of the total (60 USD of a total of 74 USD for a typical bacterial genome in 2018).

The removal of the culture requirement can drastically decrease turn-around time from sample to data and enable identification of both rare and novel pathogens.

Easy-to-collect sample sites (e.g., faeces and sputum) typically also have a resident microbiota, so it can be challenging to distinguish the etiological agent of disease from colonizing microbes.

Integrating sequencing data from different methods into a single diagnostics pipeline is therefore an attractive prospect to quickly identify the genomic needles in the metagenomic haystack in a species-agnostic manner. For example, the presence of a particular antibiotic-resistance gene in sequencing data may recommend against the use of that antibiotic; whether the gene is present in data from a single-species isolate or from metagenomes is irrelevant.

However, how these analyses are implemented varies widely, both between microbial species and human labs. Despite some commercial attempts at one-stop analysis suites such as Ridom Seqsphere+ (http://www.ridom.com/seqsphere/), most laboratories use a collection of open-source tools to perform particular subanalyses. Typically, these tools are then woven together into a patchwork of software (a 'pipeline'). The idea of a pipeline is to allow within-laboratory standardized analysis of batches of isolates with relatively little manual bioinformatics work. Such pipelines can be highly customizable for a wide range of questions. There are also some communal efforts at streamlining workflows across laboratories. As an example, Galaxy (https://usegalaxy.org) is a framework that allows nonbioinformaticians to use a wide array of bioinformatics tools through a web interface.",

In order to move towards real-time interpretable results for clinics it will be necessary to take certain shortcuts. The focus should be on rapid, automated analysis and clear, unambiguous results. Some steps in the pipeline can simply be omitted for clinical purposes. As an example, genome assembly might appear to be a bottleneck for real-time WGS diagnostics, but is probably rarely required; sufficient characterization of an isolate can be made by analysis of the k-mers in the raw sequence data, which is orders of magnitude faster. Accurate identification of an isolate can be made rapidly with MinHash-based k-mer matching methods such as Mash [78] , and AMR elements can be identified from k-mers alone [14] . Another example of a computationally intensive step that could be omitted from a default pipeline is sophisticated phylogenetic inference. Best practice for the creation of phylogenetic trees may involve evaluating the individual likelihood of a very wide range of possible trees given a sequence alignment or other distance metric, repeated for thousands of bootstrapped replicates, giving a tree with high confidence but with extreme computational time costs.

Results would have to be continuously validated, and international accreditation standards met at regular intervals. At a national level, accreditation bodies (e.g., UKAS in the UK) may lack the expertise required. In our experience, many promising databases have collapsed after funding expired or the responsible postdoc left for another job. If WGS is ever to make it into the clinic it will be necessary to secure indefinite funding of both infrastructure and personnel for such databases.",

Additionally, and perhaps significantly, it also highlights the difficulty to communicate the potential benefits of WGS to the day-to-day life of a clinic. The main proponents of WGS tend to be based in the public health/research environment and are rarely actively involved in clinical decision-making. This in itself can present something of a language barrier, challenging meaningful dialogue over how adoption of new approaches can lead to quantifiable improvements in existing systems. Further, the physical planning, implementation and integration of WGS diagnostics may be unlikely to succeed without carefully planned introduction and continued training of its user base. This is of course challenged by the already resource-limited infrastructure of many clinical settings.",

There is also a genuine risk that precious knowledge in basic microbiology will be lost after the transition to WGS, particularly if investment prioritises new technology at the expense of older expertise. More positively, irrespective of the future implementation of WGS in clinical microbiology, we should not forget that the availability of extensive genomic data has been instrumental in the development of a multitude of routine non-WGS typing schemes.",

One precedent for the successful adoption of a technology without transitions through its acknowledged historical predecessors is the widespread use of mobile phones in Africa. This has greatly increased communication and allowed access to e-banking, despite the fact that many people previously had no traditional bank account and only limited access to landlines. Most hospitals in the developing world do not currently benefit from a clinical microbiology laboratory. The installation of a molecular laboratory based around a standard sequencer, such as a benchtop Miseq, might constitute an ideal investment, as it is neither far more expensive nor more complex than setting up a standard clinical microbiology laboratory.

The strains share most of their chromosome, but with G2 having acquired one point mutation (small black line) in one of the genes of the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) typing schemes, and thus being assigned to a different sequence type (ST); G3 also acquired an insertion on the chromosome. Point mutations on the chromosome are represented by short black lines. Additionally, all three strains share two plasmids (red and blue) carrying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) elements (shapes), and G1 has an additional private plasmid (purple).
