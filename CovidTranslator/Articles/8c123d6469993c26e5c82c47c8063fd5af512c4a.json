C. jacchus is susceptible to infection with the blood stages of several species of malaria parasite including the line designated MVF1 (Mitchell et al., 1988) from which it recovers and shows immunity to reinfection. By exploiting these two phenomena, EBV-transformed, marmoset lymphoblastoid cell lines secreting antibodies to malaria parasite antigens have been generated and cloned. We believe this to be the first time that monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been raised from common marmosets. Since numerous and diverse human pathogens can infect this small primate in the laboratory, these methods may prove generally applicable for the generation of MAbs whose specificities derive from immune responses to infection.",

            "text": "We have been evaluating C. jacchus as a laboratory host for Plasmodium vivax, a widely distributed and clinically important human malaria parasite. In one marmoset which had been infected with a laboratory line of P. vwax, we first observed and then isolated a morphologically altered, virulent malaria which was initially considered to be a marmoset-adapted, mutant of P. vivax (Mitchell et al., 1988) . Recent gene sequence data refute this assumption and suggest that a second species of malaria parasite contaminated the original inoculum; formal reidentification is in hand (Waters et al., in preparation) . The immunobiology of this malaria infection, designated MVF1 (Marmoset Virulent Form 1), has been extensively studied in C. jacchus. Primary infections with MVF1 are self-limiting and generate high titres of anti-malarial immunoglobulin G (IgG). Challenge of self-cured animals results in a low grade, abbreviated parasitaemia accompanied by a further rise in antibody titres (Mitchell et al., 1988) . We have used EBV to immortalise splenic lymphocytes from common marmosets which have recovered from infection with MVF1 malaria and have cloned the resulting lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Using X-irradiated, EBV-transformed LCLs raised from naive marmosets as feeder cells, monocional, marmoset LCLs were generated which were shown to secrete antibodies directed against MVF1 malaria antigens. These MAbs, whose specificities are derived from a protective immune response, will further our understanding of the immunobiology of this model system.",

Consequently, it is necessary to compromise between cloning late so that a significant proportion of the population seeded will consist of immortalised cells and cloning early so that the desired specificities will not be lost through overgrowth.

However, this result is thought more likely to be artefactual, resulting from a greater affinity of the anti-human IgG used in screening supernatants for anti-malaria antibody for marmoset IgG than that of the anti-human IgM used for marmoset IgM, thereby biasing the assay towards detection of lgG antibodies.

            "text": "As a laboratory primate for immunological study, the common marmoset possesses several useful characteristics: it is small, easy to handle, requires relatively simple husbandry and breeds readily in captivity, usually bearing twins which are haematopoietic chimaeras. Furthermore, as de-scribed above, the generation of marmoset MAbs is now feasible. C. jacchus is susceptible to infection with diverse human pathogens of major clinical importance including Coronavirus (Russell et al., 1985) , Junin virus (Avila et al., 1987) , Varicella Zoster virus (Provost et al., 1987) , Parainfluenza type 1 (Sendai) Virus (Sunderland et al., 1986) , HTLV type 1 (Kinoshita et al., 1985) , EBV (Wedderburn et al., 1984) , Campylobacterfetus (Russell et al., 1985) , Legionella pneumophila (Baskerville et al., 1983a) , Bordetella bronchiseptica (Baskerville et al., 1983b) , Chlamydia trachomatis (Johnson et al., 1981) , Mycoplasma genitalum (Taylor-Robinson et al., 1987) , Trypanosoma cruzi (Scott et al., 1985) , Plasmodium vioax (Mitchell et al., 1988) , Plasmodium brasilianum (simian form of P. malariae) (Wedderburn et al., 1985) and, possibly, HIV 1 (McCiure et al., 1987) . The protocols detailed in this communication may, therefore, find application in the study of a wide range of human disease.",
