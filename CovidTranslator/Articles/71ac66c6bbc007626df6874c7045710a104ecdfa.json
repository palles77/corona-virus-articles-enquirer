DUB activity is usually assayed using full-length ubiquitin, and these enzymes generally show low activity on small substrates that constitute the P4-P1 LRGG C-terminal motif of ubiquitin. To gain insight into the C-terminal recognition region of ubiquitin by DUBs we synthesized positional scanning libraries of fluorogenic tetrapeptides and tested them on three examples of human DUBs (OTU-1, Iso-T and UCH-L3) and one viral ubiquitin specific protease -Plpro from West Nile virus. In most cases the results show flexibility in the P4 position, very high specificity for Arg in P3 position and Gly at P2 -in accord with the sequence of the natural substrate ubiquitin. Surprisingly, screening of the P2 position revealed that UCH-L3 in contrast to all the other tested DUBs, demonstrates substantial tolerance of Ala and Val at P2, and a parallel analysis using the appropriate mutation of the full-length ubiquitin confirms this. We have also used an optimal tetrapeptide substrate, Ac-LRGG-AFC to investigate the activation mechanism of DUBs by ubiquitin and elevated salts concentration. Together, our results reveal the importance of the dual features of 1) substrate specificity and 2) the mechanism of ubiquitin binding in determining deubiquitination by this group of proteases.",

Four of the subfamilies are cysteine proteases and one family is represented by zinc-dependent metalloproteases. The most diverse structural subfamilies of DUBs are UBPs (Ubiquitinspecific processing proteases) -which are able to both deconjugate ubiquitin from target proteins and disassemble polyubiquitin chains, and UCHs (Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolases) -which are responsible for processing ubiquitin precursors that have C-terminal extensions [5] .

The first region binds the ubiquitin surface. This region interacts with the surface of the protease often leading to large conformational changes in the DUB required for optimal positioning of the catalytic machinery [14, 15] . The second region, the protease active site cleft, binds a linear epitope consisting of the sequence RLRGG (P5-P1), where the terminal Gly residue at the Cterminus of ubiquitin is conjugated to a Lys residue of a target protein. This linear sequence is highly conserved throughout evolution, implying a role in defining specificity for ubiquitin ligation, or ubiquitin deconjugation, or both. Peptide-based reporter substrates encompassing this region are cleaved by DUBs, but with poor catalytic rates [16, 17] . However, the sequence specificity requirements for recognition of this motif by DUBs have never been systematically analyzed [18] . The objective of this study was to define the sequence preference of representative unrelated DUBs for this C-terminal motif, by using positional scanning peptide libraries, to explore the relative importance of this region in DUB catalysis, and to examine the catalytic enhancement at the active site cleft produced by ubiquitin binding. Understanding these fundamental properties of DUBs is vital to delineating their function in the critical roles that this group of enzymes plays in cell fates and functions.",

As targets for our investigation of specificity we used examples of DUBs from three main groups of cysteine proteases, namely Iso-T (UBPs), UCH-L3 (UCH) and OTU-1 (OTU family). Additionally we extended the screening to SARS viral processing enzyme (SARS-CoV PLpro), which has recently been recognized as a deubiquitinylating enzyme, and which is considered a target in the discovery of antiviral drugs [20, 25] . Previous reports demonstrated that fluorogenic tetra-and pentapeptides based on the C-terminal sequence of ubiquitin are cleaved much less efficiently by the DUBs -IsoT and UCH-L3 than full-length ubiquitin-based substrates [16] . Because catalytic rates were expected to be low, we designed the positional scanning tetrapeptide fluorogenic substrate library so that a small number of individual fluorogenic sequences were in each sub-library, so as to reach the highest possible concentration during the assay. This was achieved by fixing three positions varying an equimolar mixture of 19 amino acids in a fourth position (Fig.1 ).",

The high preference at the P3 position and relatively low specificity in the P4 position can be explained by comparison with the published crystal structure of UCH-L3 bound with ubiquitin inhibitor (Fig.3) . The side chain of Arg in the P3 position of ubiquitin is oriented toward the surface of UCH-L3 and is located in a deep pocket, constructed of the acidic residues Asp and Glu. These interact with the amine groups of Arg and explain the high specificity in this position. In contrast to the P3 Leu side chain, the P4 side-chain is oriented away from the surface of UCH-L3 and there is no clearly defined pocket that could be responsible for the tight binding of any amino acids. The restricted tolerance at P4 for hydrophobic residues, revealed in our library screen, is not explained by available crystal structures [29, 30] ",

Kinetic rates on the consensus substrate Ac-LRGG-AFC were low, with k cat /K m values varying from about 2 -400 M \u22121 s \u22121 in the HEPES assay buffer (Table 1) . These slow catalytic rates imply that additional interactions must take place upon ubiquitin binding to enhance catalysis. According to available crystal structures, most DUBs undergo substantial conformational changes upon binding ubiquitin. Depending on the particular DUB, this effect can result from distinct mechanisms. In one mechanism a ubiquitin molecule binds a distant pocket on the enzyme, resulting in a change that facilitates binding of a second ubiquitin (the one that will be cleaved) into the enzyme catalytic site (trans activation). In a second mechanism the ubiquitin molecule that will be cleaved docks directly with the catalytic site and causes a reorientation of catalytic residues (cis activation) [31] . Fluorogenic substrates are a convenient tool in the investigation of such changes, as demonstrated for the cleavage of full-length Ub-AMC or Z-LRGG-AMC by IsoT [17] . Importantly, by using small peptidyl substrates that occupy only the active site cleft of the enzyme, we can address the role of allosteric changes that affect only the active site of a DUB. This allows us to observe the role of ubiquitin binding, and thence derive the mode of ubiquitin-directed conformational changes that enhance activity in a systematic manner (see below).",

At very high sodium citrate concentrations we observed a drop in activity, most dramatic for OTU-1, which is due to enzyme precipitation in the assay. The weakest activation was observed in the case of IsoT, where there is almost no increase in catalysis compared to low salt conditions. Interestingly, at low sodium citrate concentrations the potency of the enzyme is even weaker than in the absence of salt suggesting some disorganization of the structure. The salt effect could, in principle, either enhance catalysis by optimizing the conformation of the enzyme or the tetrapeptide substrate.",

Enhancement followed the order citrate>sulfate>acetate>chloride (Fig 5) . But the extent of activation was dependent on the length of substrate (Fig 5B) . Interestingly, the tetrapeptide substrate Ac-LRGG-AFC and the pentapeptide substrate containing Ala at P5 -Ac-ALRGG-AFC -both demonstrated a salt effect, but the pentapeptide substrate containing Arg in P5 -Ac-RLRGG-AFC -did not demonstrate one (Fig 5B) . Since Ac-ALRGG-AFC is more hydrophobic than Ac-RLRGG-AFC there is a possibility that the former substrate is activated for catalysis by a hydrophobic \"salting in\" onto the enzyme active site -a sort of concentration effect -whereas the latter is not, and that this accounts for the lack of enhanced cleavage of the latter substrate by UCH-L3. However, it is also likely that the Arg at P5 in Ac-RLRGG-AFC negates the salt-dependent activation of UCH-L3, possibly because it is in contact with the mobile loop of the enzyme (Fig 3B) and thus serves a similar function to the salt effect. This is supported by the higher basal activity on the Ac-RLRGG-AFC substrate, which in our hands is now the optimal short peptidyl substrate for DUBs.",

This is interpreted as binding of a proximal ubiquitin molecule in the ZnF UBP domain of IsoT, which facilitates the processing of the second ubiquitin molecule in trans. Increasing the ubiquitin concentration resulted in a decrease in the cleavage efficiency, presumably as a result of competition between the second (substrate) ubiquitin molecule and the fluorogenic substrate binding to the enzyme active center (Fig 4) . This would be simple substrate competition. In the case of the UCH-L3 we observed inhibition of the fluorogenic substrate by elevated full-length ubiquitin concentrations. This is likely due to the presence of only one ubiquitin binding domain in the UCH-L3, which results in the competition of ubiquitin for Ac-LRGG-AFC at the active center, similar to elevated concentrations of ubiquitin on IsoT. In the case of OTU-1 and PLpro, full-length ubiquitin did not result in any substantial decrease or increase of the processing of the fluorogenic substrate by the ubiquitin concentrations used in this study (Fig 4) . Most likely, this is the result of relatively weak binding of ubiquitin. Thus it is possible to distinguish the effect of ubiquitin, which activates DUBs by exosite binding, from the Hofmeister salts, which we suggest activate DUBs by altering the mobility of loops in the active site cleft, as discussed below.",

To validate this unexpected discovery in the context of a more natural substrate we generated a mutant of full-length ubiquitin where Gly in the P2 position was substituted by Val. Both natural and P2-Val ubiquitin were equipped with a His tag at the C-terminus to allow for visualization of cleavage efficiency by SDS/PAGE (Fig. 6 ). UCH-L3 was able to process both substrates, however the natural ubiquitin variant was cleaved about 20-50 times more efficiently than the P2-Val mutant, whereas in the context of a tetrapeptide there was much less discrimination between Gly and Val at P2 (Fig 2) . One possibility for the enhanced discrimination of Gly over Val at P2 in the context of the natural substrate is that ubiquitin binding to UCH-L3 may help to position its P2 residue for optimal catalysis. Further experiments would be required to test this possibility. Control experiments using Iso-T show that this enzyme can tolerate only Gly at the P2 position in the context of the natural substrate (Fig. 6) , confirming the PS-SCL library specificity. No processing of the P2-Val mutant of ubiquitin by Iso-T was observed even at very high concentrations of the enzyme. These results confirm that hits from the tetrapeptide library translate to the context of the natural protein substrate, and demonstrate that UCH-L3 possesses much broader tolerance in P2 than other tested DUBs.",

            "text": "The primary function of DUBs is to remove ubiquitin from a target protein and/or to dismantle polyubiquitin chains. These enzymes reveal high specificity toward ubiquitin, and different enzymes are responsible for different cleavage events. Although some DUBs contain secondary ubiquitin binding sites that influence catalysis in trans, the general feature that all DUBs share is the binding and cleavage of the ubiquitin molecule by the catalytic unit of the enzyme. In this respect it is necessary to recognize two separate binding motifs: (i) the size dominant exosite that binds epitopes on the ubiquitin surface, and (ii) the smaller linear epitope corresponding to the C-terminal tetrapeptide that binds the active site cleft of the enzymes (Fig  3) . Seeking to dissect the specificity requirements of the active site cleft we explored positions P2-P4. We did not explore P1 specificity because available crystal structures of DUBs reveal P1 occupies a restricted tunnel at the active center, and that only a Gly residue can be tolerated at this position. Fig.2 reveals that each enzyme has a different tolerance for individual amino acids within the active site cleft, with the viral protease PLpro demonstrating a broad specificity at P3. The high flexibility at P3 in part may explain why this enzyme can process protein substrates other than ubiquitin [33, 34] . UCH-L3 demonstrated unexpected tolerance for residues other than the canonical Gly at P2, compared to the extreme specificity of the other three tested DUBs. Despite these differences, the subsite pockets of all four enzymes are optimal for recognition of the LRGG sequence corresponding to the C-terminus of ubiquitin. Thus we show for the first time that DUBs from four distinct groups have evolved to optimally recognize the conserved linear motif. A comparison of the preferred residues in the P4-P2 subsites between the DUBs tested in this work, and the SENPs tested previously, is shown in Fig 7[21] .",

In terms of their P4 preferences, the DUBs cluster with SENPs 6, 7 and 8, whereas SENPs 1, 2 and 5 form a clearly defined group of their own. This group clustering is maintained at the P3 position, although the diversity of residues accommodated at this position by PLpro make it more like SENPs 6, 7 and 8 than the other DUBs. Most importantly, the cluster analysis demonstrates a preference of the ubiquitin sequence LRG (P4-P2) for all DUBs, and SENPs 6-8, and the SUMO sequence QTG (P4-P2) for SENPs 1, 2 and 5. This makes biological sense for the DUBs, SENPs 1, 2 and 5, as well as SENP8, whose natural target Nedd8 contains the same sequence as ubiquitin within the catalytic cleft. Only SENPs 6 and 7 seem to be outliers in this analysis, unless their primary substrates are not SUMOs, as had earlier been thought [35] . As previously demonstrated, the turnover values for short peptidyl substrates are several orders smaller than for substrates based on full-length ubiquitin [17, 29] . Clearly DUBs have evolved to recognize epitopes on the ubiquitin surface, and this is a major component that enhances catalysis. But it is also apparent that pockets in the active site cleft are important in recognition of ubiquitin, as revealed by the inability of IsoT to cleave a full-length ubiquitin substrate with P2 mutated from Gly to Val, a feat that UCH-L3 can accomplish (Fig.6) . Consequently, it appears that a combination of interactions developed at both the ubiquitin binding exosite and the active site cleft are required for optimal activity and stringent recognition of substrates by DUBs.",

Sodium citrate, at high concentrations, activated OTU-1, UCH-L3 and PLpro, and this could be due to an ionic effect or a Hofmeister effect. Certain salts at high concentrations enhance the activity of a broad variety of enzymes, including deSUMOylating enzymes that are somewhat related to DUBs [13] , through the Hofmeister effect. Sodium citrate at 0.8M enhanced activity of UCH-L3 by 12-fold versus 0.8M NaCl for Ac-LRGG-AFC and 20-fold for Ac-ALRGG-AFC (Fig. 5B ). Since the ionic contribution difference between these concentrations of sodium citrate and NaCl would only be 6-fold, we suggest a Hofmeister effect, although this is not as pronounced as for deSUMOylating enzymes where enhancements at high sodium citrate are above 50-fold [13] . The details are not precisely defined, but Hofmeister salts tend to order flexible components of protein structures [32] . A more extended analysis will be required to fully explain the catalytic enhancement by high concentrations of sodium citrate, but we raise the following hypothesis. All three enzymes above consist essentially of a single catalytic domain, and their activation by sodium citrate is consistent with a loop ordering typical of the Hofmeister effect. Indeed, it is likely the loop that is ordered corresponds to UCH-L3 residues 147-166, which are disordered in the structure of the free enzyme, but ordered and in contact with portions of the substrate in the ubiquitin-bound form of the enzyme (Fig.3A) [29, 30] . This hypothesis is supported by our finding that placing an Arg at P5 of a peptidyl substrate overcomes the salt-dependent enhancement of catalysis. This Arg is in contact with residues 156 and 157 and may help to lock down the mobile loop, thereby enhancing alignment of the peptide substrate. This scenario for the Hofmeister effect explains the data, and is supported by the well documented mobility and re-ordering of the active-site loop in UCH-L3 and closely related DUBs [29, 30] . But of course structural investigations would be required to further test the hypothesis.",

Catalytic rates are low, and as previously demonstrated for Iso-T, the natural substrate is cleaved several orders more efficiently. Consequently, specificity for ubiquitin has been greatly enhanced by exosite interactions that consist of epitopes on the surface of ubiquitin, tuning the enzymes for their specific function. Different DUBs have tolerance for different residues in their active site clefts. For example, UCH-L3 has a previously unexpected tolerance for Val in P2, which clearly distinguishes it from the other DUBs tested here. This provides proof of concept that small molecules that target the cleft could, in principle, deliver inhibition selectively, and the positional libraries used here could be applied to other DUBS in guiding drug development according to these specificities. The enzyme concentration was in the range 1-5 \u00b5M. ACC production was monitored using an fmax multi-well fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices) at excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Assay time 15-30 min. The x-axis represents the one letter code of natural amino acids (O -nor-leucine, bA-beta-alanine). The y-axis represents the average relative activity expressed as a percent of the best amino acid. Alterations in activity in the presence of sodium citrate or ubiquitin was assayed using the Ac-LRGG-AFC substrate. Data are expressed as fold increase above the activity in 0.1M sodium citrate (left panels), or fold change in activity in the presence of ubiquitin (right panels). The y axis represents the activity as an average from individual assays. The standard deviation was +/\u221210%. The enzyme concentration was 0.5-4 \u00b5M (based on the total enzyme concentration), the substrate concentration was 50-100\u00b5M, and the assay time was 20 min. The sharp decrease in activity of OTU-1 above 0.8 M sodium citrate is due to enzyme precipitation in the assay. A) Activity of UCH-L3 on Ac-LRGG-AFC and Ac-RLRGG-AFC in different Hofmeister buffers expressed as fold increase in the absence of salt. The data are an average of three experiments, and the range was less than 10%. The enzyme concentration was 4 \u00b5M (based on total protein), the substrate concentration was 100-200\u00b5M, the assay time was 15-20 min. B) Relationship of UCH-L3 activity to peptide length and sequence in different Hofmeister salts at pH 7.5 (final concentration of the given salt in the buffer was 0.8M). The non-Hofmeister salt NaCl was used as a control to rule out that the effect was due to alterations in ionic strength. Note that extending the substrate with an Arg in P5, but not Ala, negates the enhancement in activity afforded by the Hofmeister buffer. The enzyme concentration was 3 \u00b5M (based on the total enzyme concentration), the substrate concentration was 180 \u00b5M, and the assay time was 15 min. Error bars are the standard deviation from four independent experiments. Comparison of catalytic rates on an optimal tetrapeptide substrate Data represent the mean and standard deviation of at least triplicate experiments. Substrate concentration 1-100 \u00b5M, final enzyme concentration 0.5-4 \u00b5M based on total protein concentration. Note that PLpro is substantially more active than the other DUBs on the peptide substrate. ",
