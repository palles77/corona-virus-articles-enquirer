CoVs encode the nucleocapsid (N) protein, a major structural protein that plays multiple roles in the virus replication cycle and forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with the viral RNA through the N protein's N-terminal domain (N-NTD). Using human CoV-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) as a model for CoV, we present the 3D structure of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexed with ribonucleoside 5\u2032-monophosphates to identify a distinct ribonucleotide-binding pocket. By targeting this pocket, we identified and developed a new coronavirus N protein inhibitor, N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)(N,N-dimethylamino)acetamide hydrochloride (PJ34), using virtual screening; this inhibitor reduced the N protein's RNA-binding affinity and hindered viral replication. We also determined the crystal structure of the N-NTD\u2212PJ34 complex. On the basis of these findings, we propose guidelines for developing new N protein-based antiviral agents that target CoVs.",

            "text": "The CoVs have several conserved structural proteins: the matrix (M), the small envelope (E) proteins, the trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins, and the nucleocapsid (N) proteins. 7 Some variants have a third glycoprotein, HE (hemagglutinin esterase), which is present in most betacoronaviruses. 8, 9 The N protein is a major structural CoV protein that serves multiple purposes, such as packaging the RNA genome into helical ribonucleo-proteins, modulating host cell metabolism, and regulating viral RNA synthesis during replication and transcription. 10, 11 The N protein binds to the viral RNA genome, forming a long helical nucleocapsid structure or ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. 12 In situ cross-linking and immunological experiments revealed that the RNP formation is critical for maintaining an ordered RNA conformation suitable for replicating and transcribing the viral genome. 10, 13 Other studies implicate the N protein in the regulation of cellular processes, including actin reorganization, host cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. 14\u221216 The N protein is capable of inducing protective immune responses against CoV and is a key antigen for developing a sensitive diagnostic assay. 17 Coronavirus N proteins contain three domains: an Nterminal RNA-binding domain (NTD), a C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD), and a poorly structured central Ser/Arg (SR)-rich linker. Previous studies have revealed that the N-and C-terminal domains of the CoV N proteins are responsible for RNA binding and oligomerization, respectively. 18\u221220 The central region of the N protein has also been shown to contain an RNA-binding region and primary phosphorylation sites. 21, 22 The crystal structures of several CoV N-NTDs, including those encoded by SARS, 23 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), 24, 25 HCoV-OC43, 20 and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) 26 have been solved. Additionally, several critical residues have been identified for RNA binding and virus infectivity in the Nterminal domain of coronaviral N proteins. 23,26\u221228 However, the structural and mechanistic basis for RNA binding and RNP formation remains largely unknown. Understanding these aspects should facilitate the discovery of agents that specifically block the formation of RNP during CoV genome replication. We report the crystal structures of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexed with ribonucleoside 5\u2032-monophosphates as a model for understanding the molecular interactions that govern CoV N-NTD binding to RNA. We also describe the structure of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexed with a new N protein inhibitor, N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)(N,Ndimethylamino)acetamide hydrochloride (PJ34), and demonstrate the ability of PJ34 to interfere with both the RNAbinding activity of the N protein and virus replication. Our findings will aid in the development of new drugs that interfere with viral N proteins and viral replication in HCoVs.",

To begin to elucidate how RNA and the N protein interact, we determined the crystal structure of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexed with AMP. The complete statistics for the data collection and refinement of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexed with AMP are summarized in Table 1 . The complex contained one ribonucleoside 5\u2032-monophosphate-binding site alongside two \u03b2 strands (\u03b22 and \u03b23) ( Figure 1A ). As with apo HCoV-OC43 N-NTD, the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexes all contain a core located within amino acids 105\u2212120 that comprises five \u03b2 strands, one \u03b1 helix, and a disordered loop that extends away from the core. The flexible loop region lies between \u03b22 and \u03b23 (residues 115\u2212117) and exhibits a low electron density in the initial 2F o \u2212F c map. The AMP base was inserted into a hole in the N-NTD that was almost perpendicular to the phosphate moiety ( Figure 1B ,C). The phosphate group was bound to a basic and conserved 5\u2032phosphate-binding site that contained the largest positively charged region on the N-NTD surface. The HCoV-OC43 N-NTD has the same folding pattern as is found in the SARS-CoV, IBV, and MHV N-NTD; 20 however, the positions of the secondary structural elements and loops vary between the species. AMP binding to the N-NTD is clearly unambiguously defined in the resulting electron density maps provided in Figure 2A . AMP shows a temperature factor of about 20 \u00c5 2 , compared with an average overall temperature factor of around 35 \u00c5 2 . Figure 2B monophosphate with a distance of 3.8 \u00c5, whereas the Gly 68 backbone forms hydrogen bonds with the monophosphate group in the AMP with a distance of 2.4 \u00c5. Additionally, the carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen of the Ser 64 backbone form hydrogen bonds with the ribose 2\u2032-hydroxyl substituents and N7 of the base with distances of 3.0 and 2.7 \u00c5, respectively. Tyr 124 is located on the surface of the N protein in the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD and is directly involved in the interactions with the AMP base through \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking. The phenolic hydroxyl group substituent on Tyr 126 forms hydrogen bonds with the sixth amino groups present in the AMP adenine ring with a distance of 3.1 \u00c5. Hydrogen bonds also form between the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group of the AMP ribose and the Arg 164 side chain. The Arg 122, Tyr 124, Tyr 126, and Arg 164 side chains generate a distinct ribonucleotide-binding pocket and interact with the ribonucleoside 5\u2032-monophosphate via hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, and \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking forces ( Figure 2C ). These amino acids are sequentially and structurally conserved in other HCoV N proteins ( Figure S2 , Supporting Information); therefore, they are likely essential for RNA recognition and interaction in all coronavirus N proteins. In addition, the structure of the N-NTD in the AMP cocomplex is essentially identical to the previously published structure of apo HCoV-OC43 N-NTD with a root-meansquare deviation (RMSD) value of 0.19 \u00c5 (123 equivalent C\u03b1 atoms) ( Figure 2D ). Only the phenyl group of F57 is displaced backward by 1 \u00c5 to prevent steric hindrance at the AMP entrance. We solved the structures of three additional HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexes (cytosine monophosphate (CMP), guanosine monophosphate (GMP), and uridine monophosphate (UMP)), all featured protein\u2212RNA interactions similar to the interaction of the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD\u2212AMP complex. See Figure S3 in the Supporting Information. A comparison of the amino acid composition of ribonucleoside 5\u2032-monophosphate-binding sites in the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexes ( Figure S3D ) shows that amino acid residues Ser 64, Phe 66, Gly 68, Arg 122, Tyr 124, Tyr 126, and Arg 164 are interactive in more than two HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complex structures, indicating their importance in RNA binding. Compared to AMP, the higher B-factors of CMP, GMP, and UMP indicate the ligand for CMP, GMP, and UMP is quite flexible in the ribonucleotide-binding pocket of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (Table 1; Table S1 , Supporting Information). On the basis of the electron density maps of similar resolution data, it appeared that the structure of the AMP complex showed better defined electron density for all components of the nucleotide ( Figure 2A ). These results suggest that this pocket is probably specific for AMP. More studies are needed to prove this in the future.",

            "text": "RNA-Binding Activity Analyses of Wild-Type and Mutant HCoV-OC43 N Proteins. We replaced amino acid residues Arg 122, Tyr 124, Tyr 126, and Arg 164 with alanine and used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis to determine their interactions in the binding between the fulllength HCoV-OC43 NPs and RNA. Depending on the virus strain, there are two to four UCUAA pentanucleotide repeats, with the last repeat being UCUAAAC and termed the intergenic (IG) sequence at the 3\u2032 end of the leader. 29, 30 Previous studies showed that HCoV N protein has high affinity for the intergenic sequence. 11, 31 Therefore, the repeated intergenic sequence of HCoV-OC43, 5\u2032-bio(UCUAAAC) 4 -3\u2032, was used as a probe in our SPR experiments. The association constants, K d (k d /k a ), for the various HCoV-OC43 N protein and RNA complexes were obtained from kinetic analyses of SPR experiments ( Table 2 ). The dissociation constants for RNA binding to R122A, Y124A, Y126A, and R164A range from 3.83 \u00d7 10 \u22128 to 8.13 \u00d7 10 \u22128 M and are much larger than those for the wild type (WT). Thus, we identified several amino acids in the HCoV-OC43 N protein that are important for RNA binding, especially R122, Y124, and R164. Previously, Keane et al. reported that R127 and Y127 in MHV, which correspond to R122 and Y124 in HCoV-OC43, play key roles in RNA binding. 23, 26, 27 In addition, the alanine substitution of Y94 in the NTD of the IBV N protein, which corresponds to Y126 in HCoV-OC43, led to a significant decrease in its RNA-binding affinity. These results are consistent with our observations. Since R122A, Y124A, and R164A mutants have significant effects on the RNA-binding activity of the N protein, we monitored levels of viral RNA encoding the M protein to determine the effects of R122A, Y124A, and R164A mutants on the viral replication. Because all OC43 genes are transcribed concordantly throughout HCoV-OC43 infection, levels of the M protein gene should reflect virus replication. Therefore, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the mutant N protein and its WT counterpart followed by infection with HCoV-OC43. As shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information), in cells transfected with plasmids encoding the mutant N protein and infected with virus, levels of M RNA were significantly decreased compared to those detected in cells transfected with plasmids encoding the WT N protein. These results support the notion that these amino acids of HCoV-OC43 are important for RNA-binding affinity.",

Potential hits with high docking scores (87 compounds) ( Table  S2 , Supporting Information) were further analyzed on the basis of these docking results. We found that nine of the potential hits showed interaction characteristics reminiscent of those between AMP and HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (Table S3 , Supporting Information). First, they all contain an aromatic core able to stack onto Y124 of the N-NTD. Second, the aromatic core contains hydrogen-bond-forming moieties to mediate the specific interactions with the N-NTD. Third, the aromatic core contains an attached branching moiety (or moieties) to fit into the ribonucleotide-binding pocket. More importantly, among the 87 potential hits, these 9 compounds were readily available commercially. We further studied the effects of the nine compounds on the RNA-binding capacity of N protein by SPR experiments. Two compounds, O3 and PJ34, decreased the RNA-binding capacity of N protein by more than 10% (Table S3) . Because PJ34 and O3 were predicted to bind to the N-NTD ribonucleotide-binding pocket, we next studied PJ34 and O3 in virus replication assays. To enhance virus replication, we transfected N cDNA into cells prior to infection because previous results showed that increased N protein expression enhanced replication. 20 In general, a 10 \u03bcM concentration of each candidate compound was used in subsequent assays. If the candidate compound at this concentration was effective, we considered the compound worthy of continued development. We monitored M mRNA levels in infected 293T cells in the presence of PJ34 and O3 at 10 \u03bcM both with and without exogenous N protein expression.",

The HCoV-OC43 N protein exhibited weaker RNA binding in the presence of PJ34 with a 5-fold increase in the dissociation constant ( Figure 3D ). Therefore, PJ34 antagonizes the binding activity between HCoV-OC43 N protein and RNA. Consequently, the data indicate that PJ34 interacts with the HCoV-OC43 N protein, decreasing RNA binding and subsequently decreasing viral replication. Crystal Structure of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD Complexed with PJ34. To determine the mechanism of PJ34 ( Figure 4A ) binding to the HCoV-OC43 N protein, N-NTD crystals were soaked in PJ34 under the conditions described in the Experimental Section. We used molecular replacement to resolve the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD\u2212PJ34 complex structure at a 2.65 \u00c5 resolution and refined this model to an R work :R free ratio of 18%:22% (Table 1 ). The complex revealed additional unbiased density around the ribonucleotide-binding pocket of the N-NTD, suggesting that the affinity of N-NTD for PJ34 was sufficiently high to inhibit the RNA-binding affinity of N protein ( Figure 4B ). As with the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD\u2212AMP complex, one PJ34-binding site was noted near the \u03b22 and \u03b23 strands ( Figure 4C ).

            "text": "The N protein is the most abundant viral polypeptide in CoVinfected cells and is responsible for recognizing RNA and forming a filamentous nucleocapsid. 18 Because CoVs are significant threats to both humans and domestic animals, understanding the molecular mechanisms governing RNP formation may facilitate better management of CoV infections. Previous X-ray analysis revealed that the folding of the N protein's N-terminal domain is essentially conserved across various CoV strains 20, 24, 26, 34 with a right-handed fist-shaped structure in which the palm and finger are rich in basic residues, while the flexible loops remain ordered around the \u03b2-sheet core of the NTD, possibly providing a scaffold for RNA binding. Xray diffraction analyses of RNA-binding proteins complexed with ribonucleoside monophosphate have been used in several studies to identify the unique ribonucleotide-binding site in the RNA-binding domain. 35, 36 Here, we report an N-NTD\u2212 ribonucleoside 5\u2032-monophosphate complex crystal structure that comprises a pocket for accommodation of ribonucleotide binding. On the basis of the structures of the N-NTD\u2212 ribonucleotide complex, two tyrosine residues on HCoV-OC43 NTD (Tyr 124 and Tyr 126) were found to interact with RNA bases via stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions, respectively. Similar interactions were observed in complexes between vesicular stomatitis virus nucleoprotein and RNA. 37 In addition, two arginine residues of HCoV-OC43 NTD, Arg 122 and Arg 164, interact with the phosphate group and ribose though ionic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, respectively. These four residues were conserved in other HCoVs as well, and the results suggest that the ribonucleotide-binding pocket of the HCoV N-NTD exists among different CoVs ( Figure S6 , Supporting Information). No structural data are available regarding CoV N protein binding to single-stranded RNA. To understand the structural interactions responsible for the RNA recognition by HCoV-OC43 N-NTD, we modeled the structure of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD in an RNA-bound state using the crystal structure of the N-NTD\u2212AMP complex as a template ( Figure S7 , Supporting Information). Previous studies indicated that the positively charged amino acid, Arg 106, located at the cleft in the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD structure, is conserved in all CoV N proteins and interacts nonspecifically with the RNA phosphate backbone. 20 This model indicates that the RNA-binding region of the N-NTD contains Arg 106, Arg 122, Tyr 124, Tyr 126, and Arg 164 and expands from the \u03b2sheet core to the exterior loop region. A previous study showed that other conserved positively charged residues in the positively charged loop of HCoV-OC43 N protein, including R107, K110, and R117, were also involved in RNA binding. 20 Current antiviral drugs developed to treat CoV infections primarily target the 3C-like (3CL) and papain-like (PLP) proteases. 38 However, antiviral protease inhibitors may nonspecifically act on the cellular homologous protease, resulting in host cell toxicity and severe side effects. Therefore, novel antiviral strategies are needed to combat acute respiratory infections caused by CoV. The CoV nucleocapsid protein is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that is necessary for viral RNA transcription and replication. Recent studies suggest that N proteins in infections caused by coronaviruses and other viruses will be useful antiviral drug targets because they serve many critical functions during the viral life cycle. Two strategies to inhibit oligomeric N protein function have been reported. 39 The first strategy is to impair normal N protein function by interfering with monomer\u2212oligomer equilibrium through either enhancement or inhibition of its oligomerization. The second one is to target the RNA-binding site, which contains a number of conserved residues. In one study, nuclozin analogues were shown to inhibit influenza A virus replication by preventing RNP formation during viral particle production. 40 Lo et al. identified an antiviral peptide that interferes with the CTD oligomerization of the HCoV N protein and inhibits HCoV. 19 The results presented herein provide a detailed, highresolution picture of the ribonucleotide monophosphate bound to the CoV N-NTD and identify a unique ribonucleotidebinding pocket in the center of the CoV N-NTD. Mutation of RNA-binding residues in the NTD of the coronaviral N protein led to a significant decrease in its RNA-binding affinity and subsequent decrease in viral replication. Therefore, the Nterminal RNA-binding domain of coronaviral N protein would be a validated target for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs through interference with the RNA-binding activity of the N protein.",

PJ34 has been reported to protect mice against brain ischemia, splanchnic ischemia, reperfusion, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) toxicity, in addition to various models of local inflammation. 41 We also found that the cell viability was not affected by treatment with PJ34 alone up to 20 \u03bcM for 24 h in cell lines. Therefore, the efficacy of PJ34 is relatively diverse while its safety is high, making PJ34 an ideal new candidate for antiviral therapy. We found that PJ34 at 10 \u03bcM inhibits coronavirus replication and potently interferes with the RNAbinding activity of HCoV OC43 N protein by targeting the N-NTD ribonucleotide-binding pocket. On the other hand, O3 did not abolish HCoV-OC43 viral replication, likely because O3 is closer to the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD disordered loop than is AMP, which hinders any orientation suitable for the formation of a hydrogen bond network with the \u03b21 strand, based on the docking results. Moreover, since O3 is as a potent inhibitor of CDC25 protein phosphatases, 42,43 most likely some O3 molecules will bind CDC25 and consequently lose the ability to inhibit HCoV-OC43 N-NTD interactions. On the basis of the mechanisms of action of compounds such as AMP and PJ34 and the chemical features common to these two distinct compound classes, we formulated three general guidelines for developing CoV N-NTD-targeting agents: First, a polycyclic aromatic core is required to enable \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking with the tyrosine residues in the N-NTD. Second, introducing hydrogen-bond-forming moieties to the aromatic core mediates specific interactions with the N-NTD. Third, attaching a branching moiety (or moieties) that fits the ribonucleotidebinding pocket can enhance the drug affinity and specificity ( Figure 6 ).",

The HCoV-OC43 N-NTD proteins carrying a His 6 -tag at their N-termini were purified using a Ni\u2212nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) column (Novagen) with an elution gradient ranging from 15 to 300 mM imidazole. Pure fractions were collected and dialyzed against a low-salt buffer. The purified protein was finally concentrated using a 3 kDa cutoff membrane in Amicon ultra-15 centrifugal filter units (Millipore, MA) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. The protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method with Bio-Rad protein assay reagents.",

Several commercial drug databanks, including Acros Organics, Sigma Aldrich Inc., and Bachem Inc. from the ZINC databases, were screened to obtain compounds that act on the N protein by using the LIBDOCK molecular docking software. The N protein's binding pocket was represented using a set of spheres, and each compound in the database was docked in the important pocket of the N protein; this pocket included Tyr 124, Tyr 126, Arg 122, and Arg 164 because they are involved in optimal RNA binding. We identified 87 potential compounds with high docking scores. Nine of the potential hits were identified among the 87 hits that include three interaction characters with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD, which are similar to the interactions between AMP and HCoV-OC43 N-NTD.",

SPR experiments were performed as previously described. 50 The affinity, association, and dissociation between the HCoV-OC43 N proteins and RNA were measured using a BIAcore 3000A SPR instrument (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) equipped with a SensorChip SA5 from Pharmacia; the refractive index change of the sensor chip surface was monitored. These changes are proportional to the quantity of analyte bound. The change in SPR angle is reported in resonance units. First, the surface was washed three times by injecting 10 \u03bcL of a 100 mM NaCl solution with 50 mM NaOH. To control the quantity of RNA (or DNA) bound to the SA chip surface, the biotinylated oligomer was manually immobilized onto the surface of a streptavidin chip. The chip surface was subsequently washed with 10 \u03bcL of 10 mM HCl to eliminate nonspecific binding. The N proteins (WT and mutants) were dissolved in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.3) with 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% CHAPS prior to passing over the chip surface for 140 s at 30 \u03bcL/min to achieve equilibrium. Next, a blank buffer solution was passed over the chip to initiate the dissociation reaction; this step was continued for an additional 600 s, allowing the reaction to reach completion. After 600 s, the surface was recovered by washing with 10 \u03bcL of 0.1% SDS for each single-stranded RNA. The sensorgrams revealing interactions between the RNA and protein were analyzed using BIA evaluation software (version 3) to determine the dissociation constants (k d /k a ). To analyze the effect of PJ34 on the interactions between the N proteins and RNA, the N proteins were used with PJ34 in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% CHAPS injected onto the sensor chip.",

Four days postinfection, the media were removed, the cells were lysed in 1 mL of Trisol (Invitrogen), the RNA was extracted following the manufacturer's instructions, and 2 \u03bcg of the RNA was used as a template for the cDNA synthesis. The cDNA (2 \u03bcL) was added to 23 \u03bcL of a PCR cocktail containing 2 \u00d7 SYBR Green Master Mix (ABI, Foster City, CA) and a 0.2 \u03bcM concentration of both the sense and antisense primers (IDT DNA, Coralville, IA).
