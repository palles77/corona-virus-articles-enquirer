            "text": "Recently there has been renewed interest in poxvirus pathogenesis, especially with regard to infection via the respiratory route. Members of this family are known to produce a number of proteins that have the potential to negatively regulate the immune response. Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been used for a number of years as a model for the study of poxvirus infection. We have previously reported a dose dependent decrease in virus-specific CD8 + T cells following respiratory infection with VACV. In this study we have evaluated whether more generalized immunosuppressive effects are also observed following infection with a high dose of VACV. We have found that mice infected intranasally with a high, but non-lethal, dose of VACV exhibited significant weight loss as well as decreased thymocyte number. Although these mice mounted an immune response, there was a significant increase observed in bystander T and B cell apoptosis. While increased death was apparent in both na\u00efve and activated/memory T cells populations, naive T cells appeared more sensitive to this effect. These findings are important for our understanding of poxvirus regulation of the immune response and extends our previous understanding of VACV mediated immunosuppression to include generalized apoptosis in the na\u00efve and activated/memory repertoires.",

            "text": "While it has been decades since smallpox has been eradicated, there is still a justifiable concern about its reemergence, either intentional or unintentional. Because the vaccination program ended worldwide in 1980, many are left unprotected against this deadly virus, which has a 30% mortality rate (Wollenberg and Engler,2004) . Variola virus, which is normally transmitted via the respiratory route (Baron,2003) , is quite stable in aerosol form and one can envision that during intentional release of aerosolized virus, individuals closest to the point of release would be exposed to high infectious doses via the respiratory route (Harper,1961) . For this reason, it is important that we have a better understanding of the immune responses generated to high and lethal dose virus infections of the respiratory tract. Vaccinia virus is the prototypic member of the poxvirus family and serves as the highly effective vaccine against variola virus infection. VACV has been used as a model dissect the cellular immune response to poxvirus infection, (e.g. (Belyakov et al.,2003; Harrington et al., 2002; Reading and Smith,2003; Wyatt et al.,2004; Xu et al.,2004) ). Our previous studies using a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the model antigen ovalbumin (VACV-Ova) revealed a dose-dependent decrease in the number of virus-specific CD8 + T cells present on day 12 following i.n. infection of C57BL/6 mice (Parks and Alexander-Miller,2002) . Such a decrease was reported in another study following i.p. infection of BALB/c mice (Ramirez et al.,2000) . The purpose of the studies described herein was to determine whether the negative regulatory effects observed for virus-specific CD8 + T cells extended to non-virus specific immune cells, i.e. bystander cells. For example, generalized apoptosis in peripheral lymphocytes has been reported following infection with a number of pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Ebola, SARS, measles virus, and influenza virus (Baize et al.,1999; Carrero et al.,2004; Hassan and Curtiss, III,1994; He et al., 2005; McNally et al.,2001; Okada et al.,2000; Roe et al.,2004; Tumpey et al.,2000) . C57BL/6 mice were intranasally infected with a low, high, or lethal dose of VACV-Ova, the virus construct used in our previous studies (Parks, G. D. and Alexander-Miller, M. A.,2002) . High and lethal doses of VACV-OVA were found to result in increased apoptosis of all lymphocyte populations examined. These included CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes as well as B cells. Apoptosis was observed in both CD44 high and CD44 low populations and thus did not correlate with the differentiation state of the cell. The loss observed with a high, but sublethal dose, was a systemic effect and did not appear to be due to the presence of infectious virus and was not a result of immunosuppressive glucocorticoids, fas/fasL interactions, type I IFN, IL-6, or IFN\u03b3. These findings suggest that high dose poxvirus infection of the respiratory tract has the potential to result in a generalized loss of lymphocytes. Such a loss could potentially affect not only the generation of the immune response to the poxvirus, but to other pathogens with which the host may come into contact.",

Virus was expanded by infection of HeLa cell cultures, which underwent 3 freezethaw cycles to release infectious virus. Virus was then pelleted and titered by plaque formation on BSC-1 monolayers.

Thus we determined whether such an effect occurred following vaccinia infection. The data presented in figure 1B show a dramatic loss of thymocytes as a result of both high and lethal dose VACV-Ova infection. Loss of cells was most apparent in the double positive (CD8 + CD4 + ) population, but was also present in single positive (CD4 + or CD8 + ) cells ( Figure 1B ). Loss of thymocytes was accompanied by decreased tissue size and weight (data not shown). Of note, no loss of thymocytes was apparent in low dose infected mice. Infection of these mice, however, had occurred as measured by the generation of an adaptive immune response following infection with this dose ( (Parks, G. D. and Alexander-Miller, M. A.,2002) and data not shown). This dose-dependent loss of thymocytes correlated with an increase in the percent and total number of thymocytes staining positive for active caspase 3, suggesting that infection with high or lethal dose induced apoptosis of these cells (data not shown). Thymocyte levels eventually recovered by day 40 postinfection in high dose-infected mice (data not shown). Together, these results indicated that intranasal infection with a high or lethal dose of VACV-Ova, but not a low dose, resulted in significant weight loss, thymocyte loss, and obvious signs of illness.",

Cells undergoing apoptotic death were identified by staining for the presence of active caspase 3. Days 4, 7, 9, 12 and 15 postinfection were examined. No differences in the percentage of cells that stained positive for active caspase 3 were found in the T cells present at d4, 9, 12 or 15 (data not shown). However at d7 we observed an increase in the percent CD8 + and CD4 + T cells undergoing apoptosis ( Fig. 2 and 3 ). In CD8 + T cells, there was an increase in the percentage of active caspase 3 + cells in both CD44 lo and CD44 hi population in high dose and lethal dose infected mice compared to mock infected mice (Fig. 2) . Dot plots from a representative animal are shown in figure 2A and averaged data from multiple animals in figure 2B . Interestingly the percentage of CD44 hi cells that were positive for active caspase 3 was significantly reduced in mice infected with the low dose of virus compared to the baseline of mock infected mice (Fig. 2) . Given that CD44 hi cells in infected mice were likely activated effector cells as opposed to CD44 hi cells in mock infected mice, which were presumably resting memory cells, this finding may suggest that effector cells have a reduced rate of apoptosis compared to memory cells. Whether this was the case is not known, as direct determination of apoptosis in virus-specific cells in the spleen at this time was hampered by the low number of these cells.",

To test for this possibility, C57BL/6 mice were infected intranasally with the various doses and lungs, MLN, spleen, thymus and ovary were harvested and titered for the presence of VACV-Ova. In mice infected with a low dose of VACV-Ova, the only tissue with detectable virus was the lung, and even then only about half of the mice had detectable virus in that tissue (Fig. 5) . However, the failure to detect virus in these mice did not mean that they had not been infected, since mice developed a vaccinia-specific immune response despite not having detectable virus (data not shown). In contrast, high dose infection resulted in high levels of VACV-Ova in the lungs, with virus levels peaking at day 4 and eventual clearance by day 15 in all mice. Some high dose infected mice (4/5 at day 4 and 2/5 at day 9) also had detectable virus in the MLN, though at levels barely above the limit of detection. Also, in some high doseinfected animals, virus was also detected in the ovaries, a tissue that is highly permissive for replication of the WR strain of VACV. Importantly, however, titratable VACV was not found in the spleen or thymus of high dose infected mice.",

GC are steroids normally produced in response to stress and have broadly immunosuppressive effects, including cell death (Blotta et al.,1997; Kim et al.,2001; Piemonti et al.,1999; Zacharchuk et al.,1990) . Thus infection with VACV virus has the potential to significantly increase the amount of immunosuppressive GC that are produced. To determine if the systemic lymphocyte apoptosis that occurred in the spleen was the result of high levels of virus induced GC, corticosterone, the main GC in rodents, was measured following infection with the low, high, or lethal dose of virus. The only condition that resulted in a significant increase in plasma corticosterone was lethal dose infection (Fig. 6) . Systemic corticosterone levels in low and high dose infected mice remained at or near baseline levels and were not significantly different from one another. These results suggested that GC do not play a role in lymphocyte apoptosis in the spleen during high dose infection with VACV. However we cannot rule out the possibility that high GC levels contributed to the loss of cells in mice infected with the lethal dose of virus.",

In support of this we previously observed a dose-dependent decrease in the virus-specific CD8 + T cell response generated following intranasal infection (Parks, G. D. and Alexander-Miller, M. A.,2002) . In this report we tested the hypothesis that the negative regulation of the immune system extended to other lymphocyte populations. These studies were focused on the possibility that there was a systemic effect of infection that extended to lymphocyte populations other than those directly responding to infection. We found that a high, but non-lethal, virus dose resulted in a significant increase in the percent of lymphocytes staining positive for active caspase 3 in the spleen. While caspase 3 activation has been shown to occur during T cell activation in the absence of apoptosis (Alam et al.,1999; Miossec et al.,1997; Sabbagh et al.,2004; Wilhelm et al.,1998) , our findings argue against this interpretation as 1) there was a considerable decrease in CD4 + , CD8 + and B cell numbers in the spleen in high versus low dose infected mice and 2) there was an increase in active caspase 3 + cells within the na\u00efve T cell populations. Thus our data support the interpretation that the active caspase 3 detected following infection with high dose virus is a marker for cells undergoing apoptosis. In support of this we see increased staining for 7AAD in mice receiving the high dose of virus (data not shown). The increased apoptosis in lymphocytes following high dose i.n. vaccinia virus infection was not restricted to the spleen as a similar effect was observed in the mediastinal lymph node (data not shown). We note that we have not ruled out a contribution of differential trafficking to the reduced number of lymphocytes found in the mice infected with a high dose. However, we do not favor this hypothesis given the detection of death by two approaches in lymphocyte populations in these mice.",

In some cases death was found to be mediated by IFN\u03b3 (Dalton, D. K. et al. 2000; Florido, M. et al. 2005; Schwacha and Eisenstein,1997) . Death in these models is often observed even at very early times postinfection, i.e. d3 p.i. However we saw no evidence of increased death at this time. The death in our model was evident at d7, a time that correlates with peak virus titers, just prior to the initiation of clearance as measured by reduced virus titers in the lung. This may suggest the requirement for high levels of a viral protein or a soluble mediator produced as a result of high virus titers. Our cytokine analyses revealed increased levels of IFN\u03b3 and IL-6 in mice infected with the high dose of virus. We tested a potential role for these cytokines in the apoptosis observed using mice deficient in IL-6 or IFN\u03b3 receptor (data not shown). We found that lymphocyte apoptosis was unchanged, suggesting that neither was involved in apoptosis. Further we have also evaluated the contribution of type I IFN. However, apoptosis remained unchanged in the absence of type I IFN signaling (data not shown).",

B. and Smith, G. L.,1992; Reading, P. C. et al. 2003; Sroller, V. et al. 1998 ). However, the lack of increased GC levels in mice infected with the high (but non-lethal) dose of vaccinia virus did not support this hypothesis.

While also increased in the CD44 hi population, the extent of the increase was not as great, 1.5-fold for CD4 + cell and 2.9-fold for CD8 + cells. This could reflect increased resistance to this effect in activated cells. A difference in the susceptibility to death between na\u00efve and activated/memory cells has been observed in other infections, i.e. LCMV (Bahl et al.,2006; McNally, J.

Whether this loss of lymphocytes is impacting the rate of vaccinia virus clearance in these animals is unknown, although it is certainly possible that this is the case. In addition it has often been observed that one infection predisposes the infected individual to a secondary infection. In the case of vaccinia virus infection of the respiratory tract, this may occur by a number of mechanisms. For example, the damage that occurs during infection is likely to increase the ability of a second pathogen to infect via the epithelial surface. Compounding the issue, the increased apoptosis observed in na\u00efve lymphocyte populations when high vaccinia viral burdens are reached could decrease the individual's ability to mount an immune response to the second pathogen.",
