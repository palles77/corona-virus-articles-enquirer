PIs can be tightly regulated both spatially and temporally by the many PI kinases and phosphatases that are distributed throughout the different intracellular compartments (1) . The potential roles for PIs and PI kinases in the life cycle of viruses have been studied extensively. For example, PI3Ks appear to play a predominant role in regulating Ebola virus entry (2) . Several other viruses also activate PI3K during infection, such as VSV and influenza virus (3, 4) . In addition, several groups identified PI4KA as a cofactor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication (5) (6) (7) . The HCV nonstructural protein NS5A was demonstrated to interact with PI4KA and stimulate its kinase activity (8, 9) . Recently, PI4KB was shown to be a key cellular protein exploited by several plus-strand RNA viruses for replication, and the PI4P-rich lipid microenvironment is essential for enteroviral RNA replication (10) .",

SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus. Angiotensin-1-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor of SARS-CoV, which is responsible for mediating SARS-CoV entry into host cells (12, 13) . Understanding the molecular basis by which SARS-CoV targets cells has been critical to unraveling the mechanisms of its pathogenesis. SARS-CoV enters cells by direct fusion at the plasma membrane (14 -16) . Further studies primarily using pseudotyped virus systems have shown that SARS-CoV entry is pH-dependent and have suggested that the endosome protease cathepsin L may be involved in entry (17) (18) (19) . Apart from these observations, no other key cellular factors have been shown to be specifically involved in the SARS-CoV life cycle.",

We first screened several chemicals known to be kinase inhibitors to determine their effects on SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. We found that LY294002 (PI kinase inhibitor) significantly inhibited the entry of SARS pseudovirions into VeroE6 cells, whereas entry of VSV-G pseudovirus was not affected (Fig. 1A) . A cell viability assay demonstrated that LY294002 had no significant effect on VeroE6 growth during the experiments (Fig. 1B ). LY294002 inhibited entry in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C) . LY294002 treatment at 30 M strongly inhibited SARS-CoV S-mediated entry by more than 50%. In addition, we observed similar results using Western blot analysis to quantify GFP expression to detect virus entry (Fig. 1D ). Another PI kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, also inhibited SARS-CoV S-mediated entry into VeroE6 cells with no effect on VSV-G pseudovirus entry (Fig. 1E ). We found that entry of SARS pseudovirions into VeroE6 cells was inhibited by wortmannin with an IC 50 of 80 nM (Fig. 1F) , which was consistent with the results reported for type III PI4Ks (PI4KA and PI4KB) (22, 23) . Wortmannin treatment at 10 nM, a concentration that efficiently inhibits PI 3-kinases, had no significant effect on SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. There was no significant cytotoxicity with wortmannin treatment at concentrations up to 1 M (Fig. 1B) . Finally, total GFP expression after SARS-CoV S-mediated entry also decreased when the cells were pretreated with wortmannin (Fig. 1G) .",

            "text": "Knockdown of PI4KB Inhibits SARS-CoV S-mediated Entry into VeroE6 Cells-LY294002 and wortmannin are PI kinase inhibitors that target several PI kinases, such as PI3Ks and type III PI4Ks (PI4KA and PI4KB) (23). To our knowledge, the func-tions of PI4Ks in mammalian cells have not been well defined. In this study, we sought to identify the type of PI kinase that was affected by LY294002 and wortmannin. Given that p85\u2423 is the major and most important subunit among the PI3K subunits (24) , this subunit was assessed in the following experiments. We designed a series of corresponding siRNAs to test the effect of knocking down each individual gene on virus entry without significant effects on cell viability (Table 1) . Quantitative RT-PCR results demonstrated that the siRNAs we used efficiently inhibited target gene expression (PI3KR1, PI4KA, and PI4KB), whereas the control siRNA had little effect ( Fig. 2A) . Fluorescence microscopy showed a significant inhibition of SARS-CoV S-mediated entry only after PI4KB siRNA transfection compared with control siRNA-treated cells, whereas the PI4KA knockdown had no significant effect on SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. Conversely, SARS-CoV S-mediated entry increased after transfection of PI3KR1 (p85\u2423) siRNA into VeroE6 cells (Fig.  2B ). In contrast, PI kinase siRNAs had no effect on VSV-G entry into VeroE6 cells (Fig. 2B ). Statistical analysis demonstrated the significance of the above observation (Fig. 2C ). PI4KB silencing by three individual siRNA duplexes strongly inhibited SARS-CoV S-mediated entry, as confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D) . Moreover, siRNA duplex 2 was the most potent for both PI4KB transcript silencing and for the inhibition of SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. From these results, we conclude that LY294002 and wortmannin inhibit SARS pseudovirus entry by targeting PI4KB and that PI4KB is involved in SARS-CoV S-mediated entry into VeroE6 cells.",

Previous studies have established that PI4KB is responsible for the production of most of the PI4P present in cells (25) , whereas PI3K can convert PI4P into phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, thereby decreasing PI4P concentrations (26) . These previous results suggest that the level of PI4P may be the main reason that PI3KR1 and PI4KB demonstrate different functions in SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. To investigate whether kinase activity could account for the different effects of the PI kinases on SARS-CoV S-mediated entry and to test whether PI4P lipids directly regulate viral entry independent of PI4KB, VeroE6 cells were transiently transfected with the SAC1 gene, a PI phosphatase that specifically converts PI4P lipids back to PI (27) . This phosphatase has been shown to oppose PI4KB in vivo. As demonstrated by the virus entry assay (Fig. 3, A and B) , SARS-CoV S-mediated entry was reduced by \u03f380% in VeroE6 cells that transiently overexpressed recombinant FLAG-Sac1 compared with control VeroE6 cells, whereas VSV-G pseudovirus entry was not affected by recombinant Sac1 expression. In transiently transfected cells, recombinant Sac1 was indeed present, as shown by the detection of FLAG expression at the N terminus of Sac1 (Fig. 3B) . Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed that GFP expression after SARS-CoV S-mediated entry decreased in the recombinant Sac1-expressing cells compared with vector-transfected VeroE6 cells (Fig. 3C) .",

As shown, PI4KB inhibition had a greater effect on lowering PI4P levels in VeroE6 cells compared with PI4KA inhibition, whereas PI3KR1 inhibition increased the level of PI4P (Fig. 4, C and D) . The effect of PI3KR1, PI4KA, and PI4KB on PI4P levels in VeroE6 cells was in accordance with their effect on SARS-CoV S-mediated entry.

The primary step is often initiated by low affinity binding to attachment sites, which promotes the concentration of virions on the cell surface. The subsequent binding to a high affinity receptor triggers cell entry (28) . After virus binding, the entry of enveloped viruses into cells is known to occur via two primary pathways, membrane fusion or endocytosis (29) . To determine whether PI4KB facilitates SARS-CoV entry via several stages or via one specific stage, the ACE2 protein on the cell surface was characterized by FACS. After siRNA transfection with control siRNA or PI kinase siRNA for 48 h, the fluorescence from ACE2 on the cell surface did not decrease compared with the control group, irrespective of the siRNA that was transfected (Fig. 5A) , indicating that the level of cell surface ACE2 remained constant. In addi-tion, total ACE2 protein levels in cells were not affected by the inhibition of PI kinases, although the synthesis of the PI4KB protein was severely inhibited after transfection of PI4KB siRNA (Fig. 5B ). In addition, we compared the binding of increasing quantities of a recombinant SARS-CoV RBR (S318 -510) to siRNA-treated cells. Consistent with the above results, there was no significant difference in RBR binding between control siRNA cells or those treated with PI kinase siRNAs (Fig.  5C ). To confirm these results, the binding of SARS-CoV S to VeroE6 cells was quantified by Western blot analysis. Equivalent pseudovirus binding was observed in DMSO-, LY294002or wortmannin-treated VeroE6 cells at 4\u00b0C (Fig. 5D ). Furthermore, we detected equivalent quantities of internalized SARS-CoV pseudovirions in VeroE6 cells at 37\u00b0C before and after LY294002 or wortmannin treatment (Fig. 5D) . The association of SARS-CoV S with cells was specific because neutralizing antibody treatment against SARS coronavirus spike protein almost completely inhibited SARS-CoV S binding and internalization (Fig. 5D) . Therefore, our results suggest that PI4KB plays a role after virus binding and internalization.",

Previous studies have shown that cathepsin L is sufficient to mediate the fusion process and that the addition of exogenous trypsin to cell surface-bound virions can bypass the cathepsin L-dependent entry of SARS-CoV (18) . Trypsin promotes fusion at or near the plasma membrane. To localize PI4KB-mediated virus entry, we investigated the effect of tryp- sin treatment on SARS pseudovirion entry into PI4KB-inhibited cells. VeroE6 cells pre-incubated with or without LY294002 were infected with SARS-CoV S or VSV-G pseudovirions. As expected, LY294002 treatment restricted SARS-CoV S-mediated entry but not entry of VSV-G. In contrast, when SARS-CoV S was bound to cells at 4\u00b0C and then incubated briefly with TPCK-trypsin, entry into LY294002-treated cells was restored (Fig. 6A) . The percentage of GFP-positive cells and total GFP expression confirmed our observations (Fig.  6, B and C) . These data suggest that PI4KB inhibition cannot restrict trypsin-induced fusion at or near the plasma membrane and that PI4KB functions before the viral spike proteins are cleaved by cathepsin L in acidic cellular compartments. Taken together, these data indicate that PI4KB is not required for virus binding or internalization but is required at or before virus fusion.",

In addition, PI4P lipids can specifically bind to some host proteins (1) . Moreover, the relationship between phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and PI4P in the lipid microenvironment of a virus is gradually being revealed. For example, both enteroviruses and flaviviruses exploit host phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase enzymes and repli- MARCH 9 , 2012 \u2022 VOLUME 287 \u2022 NUMBER 11 cate their respective viral RNAs on PI4P lipid-enriched membranes (5, 10) . More recently, Reiss et al. (8) found that elevated levels of the PI4KA product PI4P, which is detected in HCVinfected cultured hepatocytes and liver tissues from chronic hepatitis C patients, exhibited enzymatic activity via PI4KA that was critical for HCV replication. HCV NS5A was found to interact with PI4KA and stimulate its kinase activity. In our study, we examined the contradictory roles of PI3KR1 and PI4KB, and we investigated the mechanisms of SARS-CoV S-mediated entry to determine that PI4P is an indispensable element for entry. Interestingly, this hypothesis was demonstrated by mimicking a depleted PI4P microenvironment by transiently introducing Sac1 into VeroE6 cells. However, it is still not clear whether other RNA viruses, in addition to SARS-CoV, share similar intracellular molecular events that are important for viral entry.",

Therefore, some specific cellular factors may provide important clues to elucidate this novel entry pathway. PI4KB may be a key factor involved in SARS-CoV entry, although currently, limited evidence is available to identify the virus entry stage or the cellular organelle where PI4KB is present and participates in SARS-CoV entry. In consideration of the crucial roles of cathepsin L, IFITM, and PI4KB in SARS-CoV entry, further work is required to determine how these intracellular factors mediate SARS-CoV entry at each step and whether they interact.",

Whether the other subunits of PI3K function in the same way as p85\u2423 remains to be determined. Because there are only two forms of PI3K regulatory subunits and the p85\u2423 subunit accounts for the majority of its activity, we believe that a knockdown of p85\u2423 would inhibit most PI3K functions. However, we were unable to determine whether the p85\u2424 subunit was also involved in SARS-CoV entry; therefore, further research is needed.",

Future work will be necessary to determine the other factors, including host cell proteins, that are involved in this process and to determine how the PI4P microenvironment initiates the next steps for replication.",
