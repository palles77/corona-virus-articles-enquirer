            "text": "Diarrhea in cattle is one of the most economically costly disorders, decreasing milk production and weight gain. In the present study, we established a novel simultaneous detection system using TaqMan real-time PCR designed as a system for detection of microbes from bovine diarrhea using real-time PCR (referred to as Dembo-PCR). Dembo-PCR simultaneously detects a total of 19 diarrhea-causing pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and protozoa. Specific primer-probe sets were newly designed for 7 pathogens and were synthesized on the basis of previous reports for 12 pathogens. Assays were optimized to react under the same reaction conditions. The PCR efficiency and correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of standard curves for each assay were more than 80% and 0.9766, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity of Dembo-PCR in fecal sample analysis was measured with feces spiked with target pathogens or synthesized DNA that included specific nucleotide target regions. The resulting limits of detection (LOD) for virus-spiked samples, bacteria and DNA fragments were 0.16-1.6 TCID 50 (PFU/reaction), 1.3-13 CFU/reaction and 10-100 copies/reaction, respectively. All reactions showed high sensitivity in pathogen detection. A total of 8 fecal samples, collected from 6 diarrheic cattle, 1 diarrheic calf and 1 healthy cow, were tested using Dembo-PCR to validate the assay's clinical performance. The results revealed that bovine coronavirus had infected all diarrheic adult cattle and that bovine torovirus had infected the diarrheic calf. These results suggest that Dembo-PCR may be a powerful tool for diagnosing infectious agents in cattle diarrhea.",

            "text": "One central problem is the fact that the factors that con-tribute to this disorder are complicated, with diarrhea attributed to both infectious and noninfectious factors. Infectious pathogens are particularly well-known causative agents and include viruses, bacteria and protozoa. Common infectious agents that cause diarrhea in cattle are group A rotavirus (RVA), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine vial diarrhea virus (BVDV), Salmonella sp. and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) [1, 4] . Recently, bovine enterovirus (BEV), mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV), group B rotavirus (RVB), group C rotavirus (RVC) and bovine torovirus (BToV) have been reported as potential pathogens causing diarrhea [2, 3, 12, 14, 19, 30] . In addition, Cho et al. reported that more than 50% of the diarrheic calves they tested were concurrently infected with more than one pathogen [5] . Besides infectious diarrhea, noninfectious agents also induce diarrhea due to inadequate uptake of colostrum, unhygienic breeding, inappropriate feeding and numerous other factors [6, 25] . Since several factors concurrently contribute to disease development, it is difficult to identify the specific causative agents for any specific case of diarrhea. Serodiagnosis, PCR and pathogen isolation are currently used to screen infectious diarrhea. However, these assays are restricted in terms of the detectible number of agents, because they are designed as specific assays that usually detect single target pathogens. For rapid diagnosis, a broad-range detection assay is required. Toward this end, multiplex realtime PCR using a hydrolysis probe has been mainly used to concurrently detect pathogens, because of the method's high sensitivity, simple procedure and reduced instrumentation requirements compared with other methods of inspection. Several studies have described this method using probes with different fluorescent dyes applied in a single tube [7, 10, 15] . However, these methods can only detect at most 5 target pathogens under the same thermal cycling conditions. In terms of comprehensiveness and rapidity, multiplex real-time PCR is not sufficient for differential diagnosis of diarrhea in cattle, because numerous factors may contribute to this disease, including both noninfectious and infectious agents.",

After pathogen RNA and DNA were extracted, the sample, reagents, and each primer and probe were mixed in individual reaction tubes. Samples were applied at 2 \u00b5l per tube. Cycling conditions, reagents and nucleic acid extraction procedures are described below. To verify the absence of nucleic acid loss during the extraction step, the extraction liquids used in the QIAGEN and Roche kits were analyzed as samples using \u03b2-actin primer-probe sets. Furthermore, PCR products were used as \u03b2-actin positive controls, which were created from Mardin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells using conventional PCR primers (data not shown). Nuclease-free water was applied as a negative control sample, again using \u03b2-actin primer-probe sets. To prepare each sample for assay, 10% fecal suspensions were made in PBS (\u2212). Then, 200 \u00b5l of a suspension was used directly for the extraction of bacteria and protozoa nucleic acids with a QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). For virus detection, 200 \u00b5l of a suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 rpm, and viral DNA and RNA were extracted from the supernatant of the 200 \u00b5l of suspension with a High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Both nucleic acid extraction procedures were conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol. A LightCycler Nano (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) was used for all qPCR reactions performed in this study. A one step PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Perfect Real time) (TaKaRa Bio, Otsu, Japan) was used for amplification of extracts from RNA viruses, and Premix Ex Taq (Perfect Real time) (TaKaRa Bio) was used for amplification of extracts from DNA viruses, bacteria and protozoa. All reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 \u00b5l, which contained the sample nucleic acid, primers, probes (the final concentration of all primers and probes was 0.2 \u00b5M) and all other components included in the kits, according to the manufacturers' protocols. Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 45\u00b0C for 5 min and 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 sec, 55\u00b0C for 20 sec and 72\u00b0C for 20 sec. Fluorescence data were analyzed automatically using The software excluded early cycle data up to 16, and the number of minimum relative amplifications was permuted at zero. Evaluation of real-time PCR performance using synthesized DNA: For the purpose of validation, real-time PCR reliability, sensitivity and linearity of standard curves were verified by testing tenfold serial dilutions of synthesized DNA, including each target genome sequence (1 \u00d7 10\u00b0-1 \u00d7 10 6 or 5 \u00d7 10\u00b0-5 \u00d7 10 6 copies/reaction). The synthesized DNA was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.). Pathogen dilutions were repeated twice in separate runs, and a standard curve was constructed from the Cq values. The PCR efficiency (E) was calculated using the standard curve slope according to the following formula: E=(10 -1/slope (\u22121)). The correlation coefficient (R 2 ) was also calculated.",

The results showed that only BToV was detected in this calf. Previous studies showed that BToV produces mild-to-moderate diarrhea in calves under both experimental and field conditions [12, 24] . The results obtained from Dembo-PCR suggested that diarrhea in the calf in this study was caused by BToV. However, diarrhea can also be caused by noninfectious agents, such as environmental factors and the condition of cattle immunity [6] . Moreover, BToV can be detected occasionally in healthy cattle. The association of BToV with diarrhea in this case was not obvious. A further study of how BToV causes diarrhea in cattle should be conducted.",
