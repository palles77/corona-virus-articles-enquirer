Chinese traditional herbal medicines have provided remedies for many health problems. There exists a possibility that Chinese herbs may provide protection against T. gondii. This work aims to assess the protective efficacy of combined Chinese herbs against T. gondii. We screened five herbal medicines that have different pharmacological effects and combined them into a prescription according to the traditional Chinese medicine compatibility principle. The drug potential and protective efficacy were evaluated through a mouse model by determining the survival time, the parasite load in blood and tissues, the change of cell proportions in blood and histological detection. The results showed that the survival time of mice in the 500 mg Chinese herbs group and sulfadiazine group was significantly longer than that of the PBS control group. Also the parasite load in blood and tissues of 500 mg Chinese herbs and sulfadiazine groups was significantly lower than that of PBS group at 7 days post infection (dpi), which was in accordance with the result of histological detection. Monocyte and neutrophil of infected mice were remarkably increased while lymphocyte was dramatically decreased compared to that of blank group at 7 dpi. The results demonstrated that the 500 mg dosage of our Chinese herbs could slow down the replication of T. gondii and prolong the survival time of mice and could be considered as possible candidate drug against toxoplasmosis.",

            "text": "Toxoplasmosis caused by the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous worldwide parasitic zoonotic disease (Innes, 2010a) . It is usually asymptomatic in immune-competent individuals but may occasionally lead to severe ocular and neurological disorders (Furtado et al., 2013) . When it comes to immune-compromised and congenitally infected individuals, toxoplasmosis can result in lethal systemic disease and eventually death (Shen et al., 2016) . Currently, the control of T. gondii mainly depends on chemotherapy, such as the combination of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine, but these drugs have serious side effects (Petersen and Schmidt, 2003) . Even though many antigens including rhoptry, surface, and dense granule excreted-secreted antigens were evaluated as potential vaccines (Kur et al., 2009) , there is no licensed vaccine against T. gondii infection clinically making the situation even worse (Jongert et al., 2009; Innes, 2010b) . Therefore, new efficient drugs and safe protective therapies are needed. Artemisinin isolated from a Chinese traditional medicine Artemisia annua is now included in standard treatment worldwide for Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Subsequent to that, interest in Chinese traditional medicine has risen to be considered for providing therapeutic reagents for many infectious diseases. The Radix clematidis extract is reported to be a potent inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and notably blocks the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway in breast carcinoma cells (Noh et al., 2011). Na-Bangchang and Karbwang (2014) found that a Chinese traditional medicine Atractylodes possesses various pharmacological effects with anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activity, and is now a potential chemotherapeutic for cholangiocarcinoma found in Southeast Asia. Artemisia anomala has been widely and in long-term used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases in China. Recent findings suggested that it manifests its antiinflammatory effects through inhibiting the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (Tan et al., 2014) . Glycyrrhizin, extracted from Liquorice, was reported to have antiviral activity through inhibiting replication of the pathogen (Cinatl et al., 2003) .",

Columns with different letters present statistical difference (P<0.05) question as to whether Chinese traditional medicines could afford protection against T. gondii. Therefore, five herbal medicines that have different pharmacological effects were screened and combined into a prescription according to the traditional Chinese medicine compatibility principle and then the drug potential and protective efficacy were evaluated through a mouse model. Molecular methods, particularly real-time PCR, have been treated as sensitive and reliable tools for determining the parasite loads of T. gondii (Bell and Ranford-Cartwright, 2002; Li et al., 2012) . Hence, we applied an SAG1-based real-time PCR method to determine the parasite loads in blood and tissues. We found T. gondii DNA could be detected in blood and tissues from all infected groups at 3 dpi with a relatively high level and was almost all doubled from 3 to 7 dpi while no significant difference was observed among these groups.",

The lungs of sulfadiazine and Chinese herbs-treated mice possessed a significantly lower parasite load than that of the PBS control group (P<0.05) and the histological result verified this from the morphological perspective. The lungs of all T. gondii-infected mice displayed interstitial pneumonia which had much thicker alveolar walls compared to those of the blank control group.

Liver (a-g), lung (h-n), and spleen (o-u) were collected from seven groups. Scale bars represent 20 \u00b5m (a-g) and 50 \u00b5m (h-u) significantly longer survival time (P<0.05) than the PBS-treated mice. In addition, the average survival time of 500 mg Chinese herbs-treated mice presented a similar level as many studies on DNA vaccines; the average survival time of rROP18-immunized ICR mice is 11.5 d (Qu et al., 2013) and Zheng et al. (2013) found that after being immunized with rROP5+ rSAG1, mice had prolonged survival time of 12.1 d. We assume that T. gondii was able to move to most tissues of mice through blood based on the fact that DNA copies of T. gondii had been detected in blood, liver, spleen, and lung. Actually, Dadimoghaddam et al. (2014) found T. gondii moved to various tissues within 24 h after i.p. injection and the largest number of parasites was observed in the heart, kidney, and liver. The movement trend of T. gondii and parasite load in tissues have been used mainly to evaluate the vaccine effect, anti-parasite and drug disease severity (Bell and Ranford-Cartwright, 2002; Romand et al., 2004) . The results gathered here suggested that these combined Chinese herbs could afford efficient protection against acute T. gondii infection. Machado et al. (2014) demonstrated that the increased monocytes and lymphocytes could be treated as a relevant hematological biomarker of acute retinochoroidal lesions caused by T. gondii. Thus we used an IDEXX ProCyte Dx \u00ae hematology analyzer to determine the changes of cell proportions in blood at 3 and 7 dpi. We found that there was no significant difference among the T. gondii infected groups on eosinophil at 3 or 7 dpi. However, monocytes and neutrophils of infected mice were remarkably increased while lymphocytes were dramatically decreased compared to those of the blank control group at 7 dpi. On the other hand, the significantly lower lymphocyte and slighter lower monocyte of sulfadiazine and 500 mg Chinese herbs-treated mice than those of other Chinese herbs-treated mice suggests that effective drugs may decrease the cell proportions to hinder the cellular transmission of T. gondii. There are no differences between normal mice and infected mice at 3 dpi. We found T. gondii was capable of escaping the immune system in blood when combining the results of parasite load in blood at 3 dpi. In accordance with the results of Machado et al. (2014) , the monocytes were increased drastically at 7 dpi. The recruitment of monocytes is essential in restricting the replication of the T. gondii murine model (Mordue and Sibley, 2003; Robben et al., 2005) . On the other hand, monocytes as well as neutrophils and eosinophils are strong candidates for transport of T. gondii in blood in a way known as a \"Trojan Horse\" (Lachenmaier et al., 2011) , so the activity of monocyte must be carefully controlled. However, the trend of lymphocytes was opposite to that of Machado et al. (2014) . The percentage of lymphocytes was decreased in infected mice mainly because ICR mice were sensitive to T. gondii and failed to eliminate the parasite, which was in accordance with the result that all infected mice eventually died.",
