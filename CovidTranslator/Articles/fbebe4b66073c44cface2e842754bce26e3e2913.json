It is a great challenge to fight effectively and appropriately against a pandemic [13, 14] , especially when we do not know much about the novel coronavirus [2, 15] . Rational and proportionate responses to such a virus outbreak are needed. At present, the strict control measures, for the areas with minor infection (which is under control), are overreacted.",

The risk in the Tibet Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Gansu Province, and Western Inner Mongolia Autonomous region is very low. We suggest rational, proportionate control measures ( Table 2) . For example, the cities with the risk level IV (Fig. 3) should return to normal status, under the condition of border control, in case of imported infections from high risk areas. There is a high probability that a few transmission clusters of 2019-nCoV would happen after loosing the control in several provinces. Under such circumstance, the cities where virus returned should be managed again under higher level of responses to the public health emergencies.",
