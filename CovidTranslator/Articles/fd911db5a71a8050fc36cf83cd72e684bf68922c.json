Efficient literature searching is an indispensable tool for medical practice, research, and education. The practice of evidence-based medicine requires the integration of the best available evidence with patient conditions and preferences to guide clinical practice every day. 1 However, keeping up with the literature has become an increasingly difficult task for the busy practicing physician. The amount of medical information available has increased exponentially. It is estimated that the average physician uses 2 million pieces of information to practice medicine. 2 There are 7 million pages of information added to the World Wide Web every day. 3 \"Information overload\" is being recognized as a prevalent problem. 4 In 1996, Waddington reported that information overload was leading to stress and tension within the work environment, resulting in longer working hours, loss of job satisfaction, decrease in social life, tiredness and illness, and a degradation in personal relationships. 5 The report underscored the need to take information management seriously. This has led to a growing realization among the medical community of the importance of acquiring and teaching information management skills.",

            "text": "Traditionally, physicians have relied on textbooks, journal articles, and advice from colleagues when faced with a clinical question. 6 However, this may not yield the most accurate or most current information. Reports indicate that general practitioners usually underestimate their information needs. 7 This is probably true of every specialty in medicine. To better manage information, clinicians need to understand the basic concepts underlying the different types of literature, appreciate their strengths, and know how to find the literature that will best meet their needs. A large number of health care professionals also use search engines like Google and Yahoo for information on biomedical literature. Searches in Google Scholar retrieve results that include scholarly literature citations as well as books, abstracts, and material from other scholarly organizations. When using a search engine, using quotes to indicate phrases (eg, \"perioperative outcome\") and using advanced search options usually yield better results. However, clinicians needs to be aware of the shortcomings of using a search engine for complicated biomedical searches. One of the drawbacks is that relevance ranking is based on characteristics of the Web page and not on an assessment of its meaning (eg, medical subject headings [MeSH] terms). Search engines also are not usually as amenable to complex searches as bibliographic databases. 1 There are many tools to facilitate the practice of evidencebased medicine including systematic reviews, users' guides to medical literature, strategies to improve quality of literature searches, and online resources to get high-quality information for point-of-care use. These tools are often poorly understood and, thus, improperly used. In addition, residency programs offer inadequate education on the use of these tools. Understanding that some information is freely available whereas other information requires a subscription (personal or institutional) is also an important distinction and may determine which database physicians use to search for information. In this article, the authors describe guidelines for the efficient and effective use of biomedical information tools, strategies to increase the yield of relevant material during literature searches, electronic tools available to the busy practicing anesthesiologist, and a practical solution to integrating information management in the curriculum for medical students and residents as well as for faculty development programs. The methodology behind evidence-based medicine and the process of critically evaluating published literature are beyond the scope of this review and will not be discussed here; they are described very well elsewhere. 1, [8] [9] [10] ",

The methodology must state specific objectives, materials, and methods used. Although a systematic review may contain a meta-analysis, a meta-analysis is not always a systematic review. A meta-analysis reviews data from a number of studies and provides a statistical interpretation of whether the intervention is useful or not. A systematic review is distinct from a meta-analysis because of the stringent methodology (eg, The Cochrane Library These studies may be prospective or retrospective. Retrospective studies may be confounded by incomplete medical records and patient recall issues. Showing a statistical relationship does not necessarily indicate causation (eg, early studies examining the relation between tobacco smoking and lung cancer). 6. Cross-sectional study: A cross-sectional study observes a defined population at a single point in time or time interval. Exposure and outcome are determined simultaneously. This type of study is used to determine the incidence and prevalence of disease in a particular population. 7. Case reports and case series: Case reports and series are presentations of the treatment of a single patient or small group of patients. There is no statistical validity because there is no group for comparison. These reports can be helpful in identifying a question that should be evaluated and answered. They play an important role in the discovery of new diseases and unexpected side effects of new drugs. They played an important part in the epidemiology of West Nile encephalitis in New York and tracing the spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic. 8. Expert opinion: An expert opinion is a summary of findings reflecting current thinking on the topic written by a recognized expert in the field. When using these resources, it is important for clinicians to consider whether the author used a thorough and systematic process to gather information used to formulate their findings, opinions, and recommendations. Not every resource clearly identifies this information (eg, physician-authored infor- mation and advice on conditions and treatments in resources such as UpToDate or eMedicine).",

These are very comprehensive reviews and can be found via various search engines such as Ovid, PubMed, TRIP Database, SumSearch, and the Cochrane site. The Cochrane Database also includes the Cochrane Anesthesia Group (http://www.carg.cochrane.org/en/ index.html), which produces reviews in the following 8 areas of anesthesia: (1) ambulatory anesthesia and anesthesia outside the operating room, (2) anesthesia and medical disease, (3) drugs in anesthesia and intensive care medicine, (4) perianesthetic and perioperative care medicine, (5) postanesthetic unit and intensive care unit, (6) prehospital medicine, resuscitation, and emergency medicine, (7) regional anesthesia, (8) technology in anesthesia and intensive care medicine. This is a great resource when faced with a common clinical question that has to be answered in a limited time. 13 The reviews are periodically updated; however. it is good practice to look at the date of last update and deduce if the conclusions are still relevant at the time they are needed. 2. DARE (Database of Reviews of Effects): This is a free database consisting of critically appraised summaries of non-Cochrane systematic reviews. It contains more than 6,000 quality-assessed reviews. DARE is produced by the reviewers and information staff of the National Health Services' Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York, England, and consists of structured abstracts of systematic reviews from all over the world. DARE records cover topics such as diagnosis, prevention, rehabilitation, screening, and treatment.

MeSH terminology provides a consistent way to retrieve information that may use different terminology for the same concepts. MeSH terms are arranged in a hierarchical fashion with more general terms leading to more focused terms. 17 For example, a clinician looking for literature on Aprotinin could look up Aprotinin in the search box of the MeSH database. The MeSH database will retrieve results with Links to all articles referring to Aprotinin or the ones where Aprotinin is the major topic (Fig 2) . Using the MeSH database helps clinicians find the articles they might otherwise have missed by simply searching various key words that authors may or may not have used. \u2022 Boolean operators: Boolean logic operators help define relationships among search terms. The 3 boolean operators are \"AND,\" \"OR,\" and \"NOT.\" Searchers use \"AND\" to expand a search to retrieve only citations that include all of the search terms (either in a key word search or a search using MeSH headings). 18 The operator \"OR\" opens the search up to include citations that contain any one of the researcher's search terms. Finally, \"NOT\" restricts the search so that citations with a specific term in either their indexed vocabulary or within the abstract and text are not retrieved by the search. Clinicians can use boolean operators in their search string to help refine their search strategy. For instance, searching \"Amicar AND Aprotinin\" will retrieve articles that discuss both drugs. However, the search \"amicar OR aprotinin\" will bring back a set of articles that are about one of either search term; a much larger set of citations than the search using \"AND.\" Typically, when searching most databases, the boolean operators should be typed in as all capital letters to identify their use as boolean terms and not terms associated with the search strategy.",

The third article in this list focuses on the EVOLUTION trial comparing patients who received bivalirudin for on-pump cardiac surgery with those receiving heparin and protamine and found that mortality, 24-hour blood loss, overall incidence of transfusions, and duration of surgery were similar between the 2 groups. The \"related articles\" link leads searchers to other relevant papers addressing this topic. Because the most relevant articles favor the use of bivalirudin as a safe alternative, the anesthesiologist opts to use bivalirudin for anticoagulation in this patient. In this scenario, it also is useful to check to see if there are available guidelines on patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. A search in the National Guidelines Clearinghouse ( Fig 5) will retrieve 9 guidelines when searching by condition; in this case, it was \"thrombocytopenia.\" The first one is specific to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and was created by the College of Chest Physicians.

One solution is to subscribe to an alert service that scans specified journals and sends subscribers the table of contents. Physicians can subscribe to the table of contents from each journal Web site or use alert services that scan multiple journals. An example of an alert service that provides an online table of contents from multiple journals is AMEDEO (http://amedeo.com). AMEDEO arranges journals based on 25 medical topics with various subtopics. For instance, the subtopics of \"Anesthesia\" and \"Pain Management\" are listed under the category \"Critical Care.\" The subtopic of \"Anesthesia\" contains a list of 31 journals important to the field of anesthesiology. Physicians can either click on a listed journal and get its table of contents for the previous 12 to 24 months, or they can sign up for AMEDEO's free e-mail service. By selecting the clinician's favorite journals in any category, the clinician will receive weekly emails with a list of articles published in the journal subset. E-mails typically contain bibliographic information for each reference (authors, title, journal, year of publication, and volume, pages) including a link to the article's abstract on PubMed. 21 Individuals can also subscribe to podcasts of summaries of journal articles (eg, New England Journal of Medi- cine) or summaries of systematic reviews from The Cochrane Library and listen to them at leisure. \"Google Alerts\" allows researchers to go beyond the published literature to keep abreast of advances in specific subjects. Clinicians can choose specific search terms to create a Google Alert, and e-mails will be automatically sent when there are new Google results for the search terms in different media like News, Web, Blogs, Video, and so on. Clinicians can create as many alerts as they wish, limited only by the time they would have to actually read all of them.",

The indexing of journal articles is done using MeSH terms, which are semantically limited and do not always express the meaning of the text. 2 Although MeSH terms help focus search, they are not intuitive to use. In addition, the method to finding the most appropriate MeSH terms to use in a search differs among data- bases. For instance, finding MeSH terms in PubMed is different from finding them in Ovid's Medline interface. Medical librarians can assist anesthesiologists in understanding and using the correct MeSH terms to bring back the most pertinent references when searching. 2. There is an inherent delay in receipt and indexing of journals, which can vary depending on the organization indexing them. Most publishers submit their references to PubMed before or at the time of publication, so the lag time is not great for references appearing in that database. There are, however, inconsistencies in how search engines post unindexed articles. For instance, PubMed will include article abstracts that do not yet have MeSH terms assigned, but Ovid Medline will not. However, until articles are indexed in PubMed, they cannot be found using a MeSH search strategy but rather only through key word searching. This may mean that a clinician will need to conduct more than 1 search to find all articles on a topic. 3. Finding free citations to articles and publications does not automatically lead searchers to free full-text versions of those articles. Most publishers will require a fee for researchers to access an article often known as \"pay-per-view.\" This does not allow the searcher to copy the article or forward it for distribution to others. If the clinician is affiliated with a facility or institution that has a medical library, he may be able to access an article through the library's subscriptions to the full text of many journals. However, it is worth remembering that with publishers' costs rising for institutional licenses, many libraries have been forced to cut subscriptions. Almost all libraries will offer free interlibrary loan services, although there may be a wait of a number of days before they can get the article(s) to you. Most databases, such as UpToDate and The Cochrane Library, will allow individuals to pay for access not only to the database but often to a particular group of full text journals as well. Fees for access vary depending on the database and the number of full text journals to which they provide access. Clinicians in many developing countries can gain access to thousands of full-text journals through the World Health Organization's Health Information Access to Research Initiative (HINARI) project. HINARI provides free or very low-cost online access to the major journals in biomedical and social sciences to local, not-for-profit institutions in developing countries (http://www.who.int/hinari). Currently, more than 150 publishers provide access to more than 6,200 journals through HINARI.",

Anesthesiologists affiliated with hospital or academic libraries are likely to find that they have access to many of the databases and resources described in this article. In most academic institutions, librarians will work to negotiate institutional licenses that allow clinicians and hospital staff to access databases that index biomedical literature and provide full-text electronic access for many health sciences journals at no cost to the individuals affiliated with their library's institution. Anesthesiologists should feel confident to contact their medical librarians and take advantage of the resources they have to offer. 24 ",

However, clinical decision-making should incorporate the results of formal research. Established guidelines and traditional practice are constantly challenged for cost-effectiveness and safety profiles. Physicians strive to assimilate the best evidence into daily practice. The skills necessary to practice evidence-based medicine as well as to manage information overload are not adequately addressed in residencies and fellowship programs worldwide, although medical schools are beginning to incorporate information seeking skills into their curriculum. 26 The need for a dialog regarding the form and content of information management strategies is apparent. Working in an interdisciplinary environment, anesthesiologists are uniquely positioned to disseminate new knowledge and provide leadership in developing perioperative practice guidelines using current information to improve patient outcomes. By following simple steps, anesthesiologists and other clinicians can more quickly and efficiently find relevant and reliable information to help them make the best decisions for their patients.",

Medline can also be searched using Ovid or Scopus interfaces. 2.
