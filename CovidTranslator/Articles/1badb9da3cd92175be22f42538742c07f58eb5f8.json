I assume the latter as R0 is \"estimated\" for PNG, but this should be concretely explained. 6) Uncertainty is improperly incorporated in the model in two ways. a.

All results presented should be based on thousands of simulations to avoid problems with stochastic variation. I would like to see mean percentages with inter-quartile ranges, or 95% intervals reported. b. Although some sensitivity analyses have been presented, they are very limited. The authors point out \"the model is sensitive to some parameter settings\". Which parameters, specifically, and how are they sensitive? I would like to see how variation in parameters in table A2 affect the model output, specifically the probabilities of adult and child withdrawal and the timing of interventions. Incidentally, why were the timing of interventions not discussed in the main text? This is key to the model and may greatly",

We have now cited a number of papers which have documented a) the level of preparedness of developing countries for influenza pandemics in terms of preparedness plans and available infrastructure [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] and b) the mortality burden of historic pandemics in developing countries.

From July to September 2011 we also conducted a survey in Madang to obtain data on smaller workplaces, school class sizes, market sizes, and the number of people attending the major tertiary education centres in Madang (Divine Word University (DWU), Madang Teachers College, Madang Technical College and Madang Maritime College). We asked the headmasters of Schools and Colleges, the Human Resource department at DWU and business owners of small to medium scale businesses about the respective numbers and, if no records existed relied on their estimates. We also obtained estimates on the size of informal settlements within the town boundaries from the Madang provincial government.

However in comparison to school closure only, the effect on attack rate in Madang was also increased.\" Comment 3: Since the contact network is un-weighted, I would assume that a social contact within the households is equivalent to a social contact in the neighborhood in terms of disease transmissibility. If so, this would be a crude assumption and has to be explicitly discussed about how this assumption may affect the results shown in the text.",

[20] [21] [22] Contacts within schools and workplaces occurred in fixed-size mixing groups of maximum size 10; within mixing groups contact was assumed to be homogeneous. Community contacts occurred between randomly selected individuals, weighted toward pairs of individuals with nearby households.\" Comment 4: The evaluation of the impact of school closure in mitigating an influenza epidemic might strongly depends by the model assumptions. The coupling effect of workforce closure and school closure should be also evaluated as the compliance rates may vary when implementing them individually or in combination mode. Authors may need to evaluate or discuss this point.",

This analysis can be found in the Supplementary Data File. (Table A4 ). The table illustrates that while compliance in the school closure scenario has a profound effect on transmission in the Albany model, it has only a marginal effect in the Madang models. This is because about half of the children in Madang do not attend schools in the model and household sizes are larger. Thus the majority of transmission occurs in household and neighbourhood hubs in the Madang models and less in the wider community. Please see Table 1 in the main text for specific numbers. We have also added more text to the \"Sensitivity Analysis\" part of the manuscript. This text can also be found in our response to Comment 6b of Reviewer 1.",

While a field survey was conducted in Madang to fill in missing data and make the models as directly comparable as possible, there is still scope for conducting further data collection. As with all modelling studies, the accuracy of results is limited by the quality of data used to construct the model. In the case of influenza epidemic modelling, outcomes are dependent on assumptions about the number, duration and physical closeness of contacts between people, and how these attributes of contact affect transmission probability. These data are very difficult to estimate, with the best data source available being [3]. In the absence of high-quality reliable data, we have made plausible assumptions regarding interpersonal contact, and, in the Albany case",
