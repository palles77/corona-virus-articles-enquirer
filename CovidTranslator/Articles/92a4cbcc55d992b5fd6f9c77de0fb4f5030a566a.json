The mutants included proline substitutions at HA2 55, 71, and 80, as well as a double proline substitution at residues 55 and 71. Mutants were expressed in COS or 293T cells and assayed for cell surface expression and structural features as well as for their ability to change conformation and induce fusion at low pH. We found the following: Specific mutations affected the precise carbohydrate structure and folding of the HA trimer. All of the mutants, however, formed trimers that could be expressed at the cell surface in a form that could be proteolytically cleaved from the precursor, HA0, to the fusion-permissive form, HA1-S-S-HA2. All mutants reacted with an antibody against the major antigenic site and bound red blood cells. Seven out of ten mutants displayed a wild-type (wt) or moderately elevated pH dependence for the conformational change. V55P displayed a substantial reduction ( \u202b\u0641\u202c 60-80%) in the initial rate of lipid mixing. The other single mutants displayed efficient fusion with the same pH dependence as wt-HA. The double proline mutant V55P/ S71P displayed no fusion activity despite being well expressed at the cell surface as a proteolytically cleaved trimer that could bind red blood cells and change conformation at low pH. The impairment in fusion for both V55P and V55P/S71P was at the level of outer leaflet lipid mixing. We interpret our results in support of the hypothesis that the spring-loaded conformational change is required for fusion. An alternate model is discussed.",

            "text": "A ll enveloped viruses use a membrane fusion event to introduce their infectious genomes into cells. Whereas some enveloped viruses, such as influenza, fuse at low pH in endosomes, others, such as HIV, do so at neutral pH (Hernandez et al., 1996) . Recent work has led to the hypothesis that viral membrane fusion proteins are activated by \"spring-loaded\" conformational changes. According to the hypothesis, the spring-loaded conformational change occurs in response to a fusion trigger, for example low endosomal pH, and leads to the formation of an extended \u2423 -helical coiled-coil that propels the previously buried fusion peptide to the target bilayer. Interaction of the fusion peptide with the target bilayer would then initiate membrane fusion (Carr and Kim, 1993; Bullough et al., 1994; Hughson, 1995; Hernandez et al., 1996) .",

            "text": "The spring-loaded conformational change has been most extensively characterized at a structural level for the hemagglutinin (HA) 1 of influenza virus. HA is a trimer. Each monomer consists of an HA1 subunit that is responsible for binding to target cells and an HA2 subunit that houses the fusion peptide. In response to low pH, HA undergoes a series of conformational changes, its fusion peptides are exposed, and it binds hydrophobically to target membranes. If HA from the X:31 strain of influenza virus is treated at low pH and then with trypsin and thermolysin, a fragment referred to as TBHA2 is formed. The structure of TBHA2 indicates that HA2 residues 55-76 have been converted from a loop to an extended trimeric \u2423 -helical coiled-coil (Bullough et al., 1994) . This dramatic rearrangement provides a compelling mechanism for exposing and repositioning the fusion peptide at the target membrane surface. Earlier structure predictions and studies",

Is the spring-loaded conformational change in the influenza virus HA, the loop to helix transition of HA2 residues 55-76, required for fusion, and if so, for what stage of the process? Formally, the spring-loaded conformational change could be required for hemifusion, the mixing of the outer leaflet lipids, or for full fusion, the mixing of aqueous contents. Alternatively, it might lead to a postfusion conformation. We addressed these questions by analyzing nine single and one double point mutant in HA2 54-81, the region of high coiled-coil propensity (Ward and Dopheide, 1980; Carr and Kim, 1993) . We then assessed the effects of each mutation on structural features and cell surface expression of HA, on its ability to undergo low pH-induced conformational changes, and on its ability to mediate membrane fusion.",

The choice of which residues to mutate was based on several criteria (Table I) . First, we chose residues that are not absolutely conserved among naturally occurring influenza viruses. We did this to lower the probability that the structure of the mutant HAs would be severely altered. Second, we excluded residues that form salt bridges in the native structure, since loss of such contacts can elevate the pH of fusion by facilitating the conformational change (Steinhauer et al., 1996) . Third, one residue was chosen to represent each of three general locations within HA2 54-81: NH 2 -terminal (HA2 55), central (HA2 71), and COOH-terminal (HA2 80). The final criterion involved the location of the residue in the final coiled-coil (Bullough et al., 1994) . HA2 55 and 80 lie in \"d\" positions, which are critical for coiled-coil formation (Lupas et al., 1991; Lupas, 1996) . Conversely, HA2 71 lies in a \"b\" position, which is not critical for coiled-coil formation. The locations of HA2 residues 55, 71, and 80 in the native HA structure are shown in Fig. 1 A . Their positions in the final low-pH structure are shown in Fig. 1 , B and C . Note that HA2 80 is in a coiled-coil in both the pH 7 (in the first turn) as well as the pH 5 structure.",

In addition, the predicted ability of each site to accommodate the planned mutation in the neutral-pH form of BHA was considered as follows: The dihedral angles of the wild-type residue at each location in the native structure were determined. As indicated in Table I , substitution of Ala, Gly, and Pro gave acceptable phi and psi angles at all three positions. Next we made, computationally, isomorphous substitutions of the mutant residues in HA2 54-81 in the native structure (Watowich et al., 1994) and calculated the internal energy of the segment as described in Materials and Methods. As listed in Table I , all of the proposed substitutions except L80P were predicted not to change the internal energy of this region significantly. Calculations for L80P indicated a significant increase in internal energy due to a predicted close approach between hydrogen atoms of the main chain and the introduced Pro. The low-pH conformational change in HA is believed to represent a two-state system under kinetic control (Baker and Agard, 1994) . Therefore, a mutation that affects the height of the energy barrier between the two states would be predicted to change the kinetics of fusion. Since coiledcoil formation is involved in this transition (Carr and Kim, 1993; Bullough et al., 1994) and since prolines destabilize coiled-coils (O'Neil and Degrado, 1990; Lupas et al., 1991) , we predicted that Pro mutations would affect the rate of fusion. If the mutations also abrogated the formation of the final fusogenic state, then the overall extent of fusion would also be compromised. We therefore predicted that Pro mutations, especially those at \"d\" positions (V55P and L80P), would inhibit the rate or extent of fusion. We further predicted that an HA with two Pro mutations (V55P/S71P) would be severely compromised for fusion.",

Parallel cultures were treated with dMM, an inhibitor of terminal glycosylation, since recent experiments indicate that certain HA mutants acquire excess terminal carbohydrates in HA1 (Kemble et al., 1993) . As seen in Fig. 2 A , when produced in the absence of dMM, the HA0s from the mutants V55A, S71A, S71G, and S71P comigrated with wt-HA0. The HA0s from the other mutants, L80A, V55G, L80G, V55P, and L80P, ran as multiple higher molecular weight species. When grown in the presence of dMM, however, all mutant HA0s comigrated with wt-HA0. These findings suggested that specific substitutions within the region of high coiled-coil propensity (Gly and Pro substitutions at position 55 as well as Ala, Gly, and Pro substitutions at position 80) affected the initial folding of HA0 such that it was excessively glycosylated. In view of our previous analysis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored HA (Kemble et al., 1993) , the most likely explanation is that the head domains of these mutants are not packed exactly as in wt-HA, such that the N-linked carbohydrate addition sites at HA1 positions 165 and 285 are excessively glycosylated. Since dMM does not affect the biological functions of wt-HA (Kemble et al., 1994) , all subsequent analyses were performed with HAs produced in the presence of dMM.",

V55P is also impaired in content mixing and syncytia formation. We hypothesize that the impairment in the rate of lipid mixing reflects a reduction in the rate or extent with which V55P undergoes the loop to helix transition of HA2 residues 55-76, as opposed to its noted structural differences compared with wt-HA at pH 7 (Table III) . We propose this because the mutant L80P has similar alterations in pH 7 structure, yet still induces lipid (and apparently content) mixing with the same efficiency and pH dependence as wt-HA.",

White, unpublished results). To do this, we engineered the Pro mutations into their corresponding locations in an Escherichia coli expression vector that encodes HA2 residues 33 to 127 (gift of Dr. Peter Kim, Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA). The mutant proteins were expressed, purified to homogeneity, and analyzed by circular dichroism. Given their fusion phenotypes as full-length HA proteins (see above) and the predicted general destabilizing effect of prolines on helix formation (O'Neil and Degrado, 1990; Lupas et al., 1991; Lupas, 1996) , we predicted that the order of helix-forming potential would be: wt \u03fe S71P \u03fe L80P \u03fe V55P \u03fe V55P/S71P. The predicted order based solely on the COILS 2 scores is: wt \u03fe S71P \u03fe V55P \u03fe L80P \u03fe V55P/S71P. The only difference between the two predictions is the relative rankings of V55P and L80P. The helix-forming potentials of the E. coli constructs at pH 5 were: wt \u03ed 77%, S71P \u03ed 55%, V55P \u03ed 38%, L80P \u03ed 35%, and V55P/S71P \u03ed 28%. Hence the observed order for helix forming potential (also seen at pH 7) is in good agreement with the structural predictions.",

            "text": "We rationalize that L80P shows more fusion activity than expected as follows: (a) HA2 80 is in the first turn of the long \u2423 helix in native wt-HA. The fact that L80P is well expressed at the cell surface as a trimer with biochemical properties similar to wt-HA implies that the Pro substitution at position 80 was accommodated in the pH 7 structure. Hence the segment containing HA2 80 in L80P likely did not have to convert from a random into a helical 293T cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of pCB6 HA or pCB6 V55P-HA and analyzed for cell surface HA expression by FACS \u00ae using the site A mAb (60 g/ml) and an FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). \"Percent of cells\" indicates the percent of cells expressing HA; \"Intensity\" describes the mean intensity of each sample. Initial fusion rates were calculated from the data displayed in Fig. 8 and are given in U/s. structure at low pH. (b) If the loop to helix transition is nucleated at the NH 2 -terminal end of the loop (HA2 55), then a residue at the COOH-terminal end, especially one that is already in part of an \u2423-helical segment, may not significantly influence the transition to the low-pH form. (c) Independent evidence (next paragraph) supports the importance of the NH 2 -terminal end of the spring-loaded conformational change region. Furthermore (d), L80P appears to be somewhat impaired in syncytia formation. We recently isolated an influenza virus mutant with the substitution HA1 K27E. This mutant was selected (four times independently) by growth in the presence of diiodofluorescein, a small molecule that is predicted to bind in the spring-loaded coiled-coil region (Hoffman et al., 1997) . Diiodofluorescein affects the conformational change in X:31 HA and inhibits fusion and infection in tissue culture. The mutation would promote the formation of a salt link between HA1 E27 and HA2 R54 (the most NH 2 -terminal residue of the loop; see Fig. 8, C and D in Hoffman et al., 1997) and thereby stabilize the molecule (i.e., make it harder to undergo the spring-loaded conformational change). Biochemical data support this prediction (see Table IV in Hoffman et al., 1997) . The proximity of HA1 27 to HA2 54 suggests the importance of the NH 2 -terminal end of the spring-loaded coiled-coil region for fusion activation.",

However, recent studies with both HA (Tatulian et al., 1995; Gray and Tamm, 1997 ) and with a model retrovirus (Hernandez et al., 1997) have provided clear evidence for differences in the conformational changes of viral fusion proteins at membrane surfaces. (b) Some separation of the globular head domains is required for fusion, at least with X:31 HA at 37\u040aC (Godley et al., 1992; Kemble et al., 1992) . However, it is not clear to us that the globular head domains must separate to an extent that would be readily visible in the electron microscope to elicit the loop to helix transition of HA2 55-76 (see Shangguan et al., 1998 for an alternate viewpoint). (c) It may be that only a few trimers, those at the fusion site (Danieli et al., 1996) , adopt the spring-loaded conformational change during fusion, and that these few molecules have escaped detection in the electron microscopic (and antibody) studies. The bulk population of virion HAs may undergo the change at a later time (Weber et al., 1994; Wharton et al., 1995) . In addition, we have noted a change in one of the neutral specific epitopes (N1) analyzed in the low temperature study (performed on HA; Stegmann et al., 1990) when we analyzed bromelain-released hemagglutinin (BHA) treated on ice at pH 5.0. With BHA, loss of the N1 epitope appeared to occur to the same extent and with the same time course on ice as at 37\u040aC (Bodian, 1992) .",

Additional electron microscopic, biophysical, structural, and mutational studies will be necessary to prove this hypothesis. Since we see defects with both V55P and V55P/S71P at the level of outer leaflet lipid mixing, we further interpret our data in support of the hypothesis that the spring-loaded conformational change is required for an early step in the fusion process. Experiments are planned to test whether it is required for HA to bind, hydrophobically, to target liposomes. Although our data support the hypothesis that the spring-loaded conformational change is necessary for fusion, it is likely that other parts of HA must move during fusion activation (White and Wilson, 1987; Steinhauer et al., 1996; Korte et al., 1997) . Moreover, in our recently proposed model for HA-mediated membrane fusion, we envision that the spring-loaded conformational change functions at an early step in fusion and that subsequent changes that would generate a TBHA2-like structure drive later stages of fusion (see Figs. 5 and 6 in Hernandez et al., 1996) .",

There are three trivial possibilities: The first is due to differences in the analyses performed. Whereas the prior studies have used syncytia formation or infectivity as assays for fusion, we have focused on initial membrane fusion events. The second is that in some of the prior studies, structural aberrations or deficiencies in cell surface expression of some mutant glycoproteins may not have been detected. The third is that single Pro (or other) substitutions at other positions within HA2 54-81 may have been more detrimental. Barring these trivial differences, a more substantive possibility is that the discrepancy reflects fundamental differences between the fusion mechanisms of the influenza HA vs. those of retro-, paramyxo-, and coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Although we interpret our data as being consistent with the hypothesis that the spring-loaded conformational change is necessary for an early stage of fusion mediated by the influenza HA, and although related mechanisms may operate for retro-, paramyxo-, and coronavirus fusion proteins, it is unlikely that spring-loaded conformational changes activate all fusion proteins. Two well-characterized viral fusion proteins, those of Tick-borne encephalitis virus and Semliki Forest virus, either do not (Rey et al., 1995) or are not predicted (Kielian, 1995) to contain regions of high coiled-coil propensity. It will therefore be interesting to learn whether any cellular fusion proteins (Hernandez et al., 1996; Rothman, 1996) are activated by spring-loaded conformational changes. This is an intriguing question since a recently proposed model for intracellular vesicle fusion invokes coiled-coil formation between V-and T-SNAREs (Hanson et al., 1997; Weber et al., 1998) .",

Cells were prepared for fusion as described in the legend to Fig. 6 except that the concentration of trypsin (T) or chymotrypsin (C) was 10 g/ml. In this experiment, fusion was conducted for 2 min at pH 5.0 and 37\u040aC. Incubation for longer times (10-60 min) at pH 5.0 and 37\u040aC still resulted in no fusion for V55P/S71P (Armstrong, R.T., and J.M. White, unpublished results).
