Our planet is experiencing about 500 natural disasters annually compared with 120 in the early 1980s [1] . Similarly, public health emergencies such as pandemic disasters pose a similar threat to our globe [2] . The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919, for instance, infected one-third of the world's population and killed an astonishing 50 million people [2] . Since this pandemic, the deadliest in recorded history, several other disease outbreaks have swept through the world, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, influenza A (H1N1) or the so-called swine flu in 2009, and the most recent Ebola in 2014. These events could easily overwhelm all components of the affected communities including the healthcare systems.",

For instance, 21% of SARS victims were healthcare workers, and some of them even transmitted the disease to their family members [3] .

Although perception studies are based on hypothetical scenarios that might not replicate the real events and in turn may not predict the actual behavior, this method can be very useful as it has the potential to generate very large datasets. It can also be used to predict the attitude of people in less common events like terrorist attacks, pandemics, or public health emergencies [6] . Perception studies on reporting for duty show that, depending on the nature of the disaster, healthcare providers have shown different views toward intention to report to work and fulfill their job expectations. That is, healthcare workers are generally less willing to work during humancaused events and pandemic outbreaks than other disasters from natural events [1, 7, 8] . For instance, Connor (2014) found that 45%-58% of healthcare workers were willing to respond to a human-caused disaster such as a terrorist attack, 25%-82% were willing to respond to a pandemic, and 83%-90% were willing to respond to a mass casualty event such as a plane crash or a tornado.",

EMS personnel are working in highly unstable environments relative to their counterparts at hospitals, and they are the ones who are likely to first contact patients with acute cases. They are at higher risk of injury and death than their \"cousins\" firefighters, and the national average for all occupations [12] .

The aim of the study was to explore and understand the EMS providers' views about reporting for duty during disease outbreaks and the factors that affect their feelings and potential attitudes. In order to accurately capture this kind of information, the use of a qualitative method was the appropriate choice [13] . The primary data collection method was face-to-face semi-structured interviews with frontline EMS providers. This method helps researchers to gain more information from the participants by capturing their words, insights, and expressions. While semi-structured interviews employ a number of predetermined questions, they also allow the researcher to probe far beyond the answers to get more in-depth information about particular areas of study [13] . An interview guide was developed and designed based on previous research on this topic to elicit the participants' views about working during disease outbreaks, compared with both natural disasters and day-to-day operations. For the purpose of this study, disease outbreak is defined as \"the occurrence of cases of disease in excess of what would normally be expected in a defined community, geographical area or season\" [14] . As defined by the World Health Organizations (WHO), natural disasters are \"catastrophic events with atmospheric, geologic and hydrologic origins. They include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, tsunamis, floods and drought\" [15] .",

ALS (advanced life support) services are paid and provided state-wide by the counties [16] . Both Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and paramedics were included in the study sample. To obtain access to interview participants, the Office of EMS in the State of Delaware, USA, was contacted and agreed to facilitate connections with appropriate interviewees for this study. To recruit interviewees, the primary researcher contacted the coordinators from different EMS stations asking them for site visit permission and logistics to perform the interviews with the on-duty EMS providers. A purposive sampling strategy, a method widely used in qualitative studies [13, 17] , was used to select interviewees for the study. Early participants were randomly selected from the accessible EMS stations to conduct one or two interviews at a time. Generally, three to four potential participants were available for interview if there is no active call. Later in the interview process, the primary researcher used a criterion purposive sampling strategy to recruit information-rich participants to fulfill different characteristics [17] . That is, the selection of interviewees included participants from different potential confounders such as job title, work status, gender, marital status, and years of experience as displayed in Table 1 . Participants who agreed to take part in the study were asked to read and sign an informed consent about the potential risk of participation before starting the interview.",

Given that the bulk of the interview questions were focused on comparing day-to-day operations, natural disasters, and disease outbreaks, one of the main coding methods used was versus coding [19] . Each code was labeled with a descriptive definition to keep track of the exact meaning of these codes. After coding transcripts in their entirety, the codes were refined to merge close or similar ones and to start the second cycle of coding.

Most interestingly, working during natural disasters was viewed by many participants as the exciting part of their job as mentioned earlier. Curiously, the respondents' emphasis on excitement was not found in previous studies on healthcare providers. To understand this attitude, it is important to put it in a context. EMS providers receive a considerable amount of training on response to disasters using the Incident Command System (ICS). They are trained to provide search and rescue operations, triage, and emergency care depending on the type of disaster. However, when it comes to day-to-day operations, the majority of the EMS calls are non-emergency, or non-life threatening calls, meaning that patients need minimal care and transport to the appropriate care facilities [23] . To some extent, this type of work is routine and perhaps boring to providers. As mentioned by one of the participants, the majority of their calls \"don't necessarily need all the training that we had,\" because patients in these calls \"just don't feel well\". However, during natural disasters, they like to help \"the most amount of people in the most amount of danger.\" Therefore, EMS providers prefer to provide care for acute cases of sick and injured victims, which is the kind of work that they enjoy and are trained to do.",

For instance, participants emphasized that transportation and other infrastructure issues that might occur during natural disasters could hinder their ability to come to work. That being said, if EMS providers are able to come to work, participants mentioned that they will show up as expected. This view is congruent with a study by Ref. [21] Smith et al.

While participants did not show the same energy toward working in such situations as was the case in natural disasters, they were still willing to fulfill their work obligations. All interview participants believe that there are many risks associated with this line of work, and disease outbreaks could be one of them. They also believe that they are obligated to come to work as long as they have appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and training in place. It is interesting to know that none of the interview participants explicitly indicated that they would not come to work in outbreak conditions. This view contradicts [21] Smith et al. (2009), who found that paramedics were less willing to work in non-conventional disasters like pandemics. According to Ref. [21] Smith et al. (2009), the \"unknown-type situation\" and the \"invisibility\" of disease outbreaks are described as the main barriers to the willingness to work.",

This outbreak devastated many areas in the West African region. In one of the outbreak documentaries [28] , an EMS provider had separated himself from his family and children for five months to keep them safe from the infection, while he was doing his job. This is an example of how the dedication and commitment of EMS providers could be, and how difficult it also could be to make the decision whether or not to work in such situations. Therefore, we cannot definitively predict the behavior of EMS providers until such a crisis occurs.",

The findings of the study provide a motivation to the EMS organizations to consider measures that can better facilitate the safety and well-being of EMS providers. Although this system has not been tested at a large-scale disease outbreak for decades, it would be very beneficial to implement or coordinate the implementation of a large-scale drill or exercise where all stakeholders become involved. This helps in testing the current preparedness of the EMS systems and explores areas that may need improvements such as the level of EMS training and the ability of providers' families to function well during extended disaster responses. Doing so will ultimately benefit individual EMS providers, their agencies, and the communities they serve.",

While the 2009 swine flu was a pandemic that affected almost every country in the world due to its ease of transmission, it was not virulent and in turn, did not scare healthcare providers including the EMS. The 2014 Ebola outbreak was very contagious and virulent and resulted in many illnesses and deaths. The outbreak impacted the West African region and resulted in many infections and deaths among healthcare providers. yet, in the U.S., where the study was conducted, Ebola consisted of less than 10 cases, only two of which were from local contagion. This is quite different from a potential outbreak of something like SARS or H5N1 (avian flu), which could affect hundreds of thousands of people or more. This would mean that all EMS providers would likely come in contact with victims of the disease, not just a dozen special cases. The broad epidemic, then, would present very different dynamics for EMS personnel, and in turn, may reveal different behaviors.",

It is unthinkable what the consequences would be if EMS providers did not commit with their social and ethical responsibilities to do what is expected of them during crisis [29] . Research studies show that healthcare workers are generally -except for nuclear events-least willing to work during epidemics [30] . While it is difficult to draw a conclusion about the real behavior of EMS providers during disease outbreaks using perception studies [6] , EMS providers in this sample are generally dedicated to their job, and willing to come and perform the duties that are expected of them. For natural disasters' response, they even showed excitement and thrill due to challenges and out-of-routine type work. For disease outbreak situations, while not as thrilled compared to natural disasters, they still showed a high willingness to come to work.",
