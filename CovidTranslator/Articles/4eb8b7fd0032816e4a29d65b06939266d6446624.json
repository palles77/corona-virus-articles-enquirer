The olfactory (piriform) cortex has long been hypothesized to encode odor memories, yet the cellular substrates for olfactory learning and memory remain unknown. Here, using intersectional, cFos-based genetic manipulations (\"Fos-tagging\"), we show that olfactory fear conditioning activates sparse and distributed ensembles of neurons in mouse piriform cortex. We demonstrate that chemogenetic silencing of these Fostagged piriform ensembles selectively interferes with odor fear memory retrieval, but does not compromise basic odor detection and discrimination. Furthermore, chemogenetic reactivation of piriform neurons that were Fos-tagged during olfactory fear conditioning causes a decrease in exploratory behavior, mimicking odor-evoked fear memory recall. Together, our experiments identify odor-specific ensembles of piriform neurons as necessary and sufficient for odor fear memory recall. author/funder. All rights reserved.

Individual piriform neurons respond to combinatorial inputs from multiple Piriform cortex has long been hypothesized to support auto-associative network functions that can retrieve previously learned information from partial or degraded sensory inputs (Haberly, 2001; Wilson and Sullivan, 2011) . Piriform pyramidal cells form a large recurrent network, which is reciprocally connected with adjacent highorder associative areas including the prefrontal, entorhinal and perirhinal cortex and the amygdala (Johnson et al., 2000; Sadrian and Wilson, 2015) .

Temporal control of DREADD expression is provided by doxycycline, administered through the diet, which interferes with the binding of tTA to tetO and thus suppresses transgene expression (Gossen et al., 1995) . Mice maintained in their home cage on a doxycycline-containing diet showed low basal DREADD expression, detected by anti-HA immunohistochemistry and native mCherry fluorescence (Figure 1B and C) . To induce DREADD expression, mice were taken off doxycycline five days before odor presentation. Exposure to odor followed by foot shock (see Experimental Procedures) resulted in the Fos-tagging of sparse neural ensembles (median (interquartile range): 1.6 (0.3) % of piriform neurons, n=2 for hM4Di; 2.2 (0.5) % of piriform neurons, n=3 for hM3Dq), which were broadly dispersed throughout the anterior and posterior piriform cortex ( Figure 1B and C), consistent with previous observations of endogenous cFos expression (Datiche et al., 2001; Illig and Haberly, 2003) .",

In the absence of the DREADD ligand CNO, the resting membrane potential of DREADD-expressing piriform neurons was indistinguishable from DREADD-negative cells (-71.70 (4.37) mV in n=24, (4.32) mV in hM4Di-expressing cells, n=14, -72.56 (3.92) mV in hM3Dq-expressing cells, n=15, p=0.631, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, Figure 1D ).

Mice thus learned to escape from the conditioned stimulus (CS+) by running towards the opposite side of the box. Two control odors, whose presentation was not paired with foot shock (CS-), were used to entrain odorspecific as opposed to generalized fear responses (Chen et al., 2011) . Doxycycline was removed from the diet of mice prior to training, to permit the induction of hM4Di expression in active Fos-expressing piriform neurons of mice of the experimental group. Mice were returned to doxycycline-containing diet immediately after odor fear conditioning, and memory recall of the odor-foot shock association was tested three days later by presenting the odors alone in a new box ( Figure 2B and C). All mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with CNO before testing, to exclude potential offtarget effects by CNO (Gomez et al., 2017) . For all mice, we verified viral gene expression by post hoc histological examination. Previous studies have suggested that the posterior piriform cortex is important for associative memory encoding (Sacco et al., 2010; Calu et al., 2008; Haberly 2001) . We therefore excluded from our analysis mice in which parts of the posterior piriform cortex were spared from viral infection (Supplementary Figure 2) . We combined two parameters to quantify the learned escape behavior: the position of the mouse in the box, and the increase in its maximum velocity after odor presentation ( Figure 2B ). These parameters were chosen because they described well the behavioral response of mice to the odor-foot shock pairing during training (Supplementary Figure 3) .",

They were further away from the odor port after CS+ presentation than after CS-presentation (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, W=-36, p=0.0078, Figure 2E ), and their maximum velocity ratio was significantly higher (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, W=-36, p=0.0078, Figure 2H ). This could indicate a partial memory of the learned association, possibly due to incomplete silencing of Fos-tagged neurons in piriform cortex, or the existence of parallel neural pathways that partially compensate for the loss of piriform functions. Finally, silencing of the piriform cortex in only one hemisphere did not abolish the learned escape behavior to the conditioned odor (Supplementary Figure 5) .",

            "text": "The piriform cortex has long been thought to provide the substrate for storing associative olfactory memories. Several studies have shown that piriform cortex cells can encode information that carries behavioral significance (Calu et al., 2008 , Mandairon et al., 2014 , Sacco et al., 2010 ), yet their functional relevance has never been assessed by direct experimental manipulation. Using a cFos-dependent, intersectional genetic approach to visualize and manipulate piriform neurons activated during olfactory fear conditioning (Figure 1 ), we found that chemogenetic silencing of Fos-tagged piriform ensembles abolished a learned odor escape behavior (Figure 2 ). Silencing these Fos-tagged ensembles did not alter basic odor detection and discrimination (Figure 3) . Furthermore, chemogenetic silencing of neurons responsive to a neutral odor only moderately attenuated odor fear memory recall, suggesting that Fos-tagged piriform ensembles are largely odor-specific ( Figure 4) . Finally, specific chemogenetic reactivation of piriform ensembles that were active during learning resulted in reduced exploratory behavior in an open field assay, an effect that was similarly observed when exposing mice to the conditioned odor stimulus (Figure 5) . Together, our experiments identify piriform neurons that were active during learning as necessary and sufficient to trigger odor fear memory recall. This indicates the formation of functional connections between Fos-tagged piriform cells and other associative areas and firmly establish piriform ensembles as an essential component of odor fear memory traces.",

How piriform neural circuits and downstream target regions process such artificial activity patterns remains to be determined. One possibility is that despite the temporal limitations of memory trace reactivation, piriform network mechanisms can retrieve the perception of the reinforced conditioned stimulus. Consistent with this model, recent studies have shown that spatial patterns of odor-evoked activity, in the absence of precise temporal information, are sufficient to decode odor identity in piriform cortex (Bolding and Franks, 2017; Miura et al., 2012; Roland et al., 2017) . Alternatively, it is possible that reactivation generates a state of stress and anxiety, but without evoking the perception of the odor. Candidate target areas for the processing of odor-fear associations include the basolateral amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex (Dejean et al., 2016; Gore et al., 2015) , however, the relevant neural circuit components remain to be identified. Finally, reactivating a synthetic ensemble of neurons activated during exposure to the reinforced stimulus (CS+) and the nonreinforced stimuli (CS-) did not elicit a measurable behavioral response. This observation suggests that behaviorally relevant information cannot be extracted from a neural ensemble representing conflicting (aversive versus neutral) information. This result is consistent with the finding that the reactivation of an artificial contextual memory in the hippocampus competes with the retrieval of a learned context-shock association (Ramirez et al., 2013) . author/funder.

The duration of the expression of tTA-dependent proteins is determined by the time course of induction and the stability of cFos-tTA-dependent transcripts and proteins in tagged neurons. Previous studies have shown that TetTag-dependent expression of regulators of neural activity lasts for at least five days but becomes undetectable by thirty days (Cowansage et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015) . We therefore restricted our manipulations of neural activity and behavioral analyses to a three-day time window after Fos-tagging of neurons during olfactory conditioning. Another constraint of the Fos-tagging system is its slow temporal dynamics. As a consequence, neurons responding to the reinforced conditioned stimulus (CS+), the odorant paired with foot shock, and neurons responding to the non-reinforced conditioned stimuli (CS-), the odorants not associated with foot shock, were tagged in our silencing experiments. The use of a CS-compromises the specificity of the Fos-tagged neural ensembles. Nevertheless, the CS-provides an important experimental readout for the odor selectivity of the behavioral response.",

Consistent with this model, our findings reveal striking similarities between olfactory memory traces in the piriform cortex and memory traces of contextual fear in the hippocampus. In both piriform cortex and hippocampus, learning activates sparse and distributed ensembles of neurons that appear to lack topographic organization. Furthermore, hippocampal neurons tagged during contextual fear conditioning, and piriform neurons tagged during olfactory fear conditioning were both necessary and sufficient for memory retrieval (Liu et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2014) , The olfactory system is particularly well-suited for studying learning and memory. Indeed, odor memories and olfactory-driven behaviors are robust in animals, including in mice, providing highly reliable and quantitative behavioral readouts. Furthermore, the author/funder.
