            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a new, highly contagious, viral disease, emerged in China late in 2002 and quickly spread to 32 countries and regions causing in excess of 774 deaths and 8098 infections worldwide. In the absence of a rapid diagnostic test, therapy or vaccine, isolation of individuals diagnosed with SARS and quarantine of individuals feared exposed to SARS virus were used to control the spread of infection. We examine mathematically the impact of isolation and quarantine on the control of SARS during the outbreaks in Toronto, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing using a deterministic model that closely mimics the data for cumulative infected cases and SARS-related deaths in the first three regions but not in Beijing until mid-April, when China started to report data more accurately. The results reveal that achieving a reduction in the contact rate between susceptible and diseased individuals by isolating the latter is a critically important strategy that can control SARS outbreaks with or without quarantine. An optimal isolation programme entails timely implementation under stringent hygienic precautions defined by a critical threshold value. Values below this threshold lead to control, but those above are associated with the incidence of new community outbreaks or nosocomial infections, a known cause for the spread of SARS in each region. Allocation of resources to implement optimal isolation is more effective than to implement sub-optimal isolation and quarantine together. A community-wide eradication of SARS is feasible if optimal isolation is combined with a highly effective screening programme at the points of entry.",

            "text": "In March of 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndome (SARS) (WHO 2003b), a novel respiratory disease caused by a previously unknown coronavirus, SARS-CoV (Drosten et al. 2003; Peiris et al. 2003; Marra et al. 2003; Rota et al. 2003; WHO 2003c) . The virus apparently evolved from a coronavirus that existed in animals but not in humans (Marra et al. 2003; WHO 2003c) . It is very efficiently transmitted during close person-to-person contact presumably through droplets of respiratory secretions, although its airborne transmission under specific conditions has also been shown to occur (Yu et al. 2004) . Despite identification and rapid characterization of SARS-CoV, a rapid diagnostic or screening test for SARS is not yet available. The diagnosis of SARS has therefore been based on the presence of clinical symptoms in conjunction with exposure to a known source of SARS-CoV (the epidemiological contact) (WHO 2003d ) . Individuals meeting these criteria have been referred to as 'probable' cases (WHO 2003d ) . The clinical symptoms of SARS include fever, dry cough and dyspnea, often accompanied by radiographic features of pneumonia (Ksiazek et al. 2003; Poutanen et al. 2003; Tsang et al. 2003) . The symptoms appear after 3-17 days of incubation and most individuals recover within two weeks of illness (Booth et al. 2003; Dwosh et al. 2003) . The disease nevertheless inflicts a high rate of mortality (ca. 15%) especially among the elderly (ca. 50%) (Booth et al. 2003; Donnelly et al. 2003; Ksiazek et al. 2003; Poutanen et al. 2003; Tsang et al. 2003; WHO 2003a) .",

            "text": "SARS, first reported in November of 2002 in the Guangdong province of China, quickly spread across continents, with the highest prevalence in the Asia Pacific region (WHO 2003a) . As of 24 June 2003, there were 246 probable cases and 37 deaths in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA; Health Canada 2003a); a recent report (Health Canada 2003b) quoted 44 SARS fatalities for the whole duration of the 2003 SARS outbreaks in Toronto, 1755 probable cases and 296 deaths in Hong Kong (WHO 2003a) , 206 probable cases and 31 deaths in Singapore (WHO 2003a) , and 2521 probable cases and 191 deaths in Beijing, the hardest-hit city in the world (Ministry of Health, China 2003; WHO 2003a) . Overall, SARS accounted for at least 774 deaths and 8098 infections globally (Lingappa et al. 2004) . Because of its rapid transmissibility across continents and potential to cause large epidemics, the WHO launched a vigorous global campaign to combat SARS. Despite such effort, a definitive treatment, prophylaxis or vaccine against SARS remains elusive. Consequently, isolation of individuals with symptoms of SARS and quarantine of individuals suspected to be exposed to SARS-CoV were adopted worldwide as means to control ongoing and impending outbreaks. Historically, isolation and quarantine of individuals carrying, or suspected to be carrying, infectious pathogens have been effective approaches for containing contagious diseases. However, isolation of individuals with clinical symptoms of SARS, in hospitals or at home, produced mixed results because it was associated with significant new infections in various parts of the world, including GTA where most of all probable cases originated in hospitals involving health-care workers (Booth et al. 2003; Donnelly et al. 2003; Dwosh et al. 2003; MMWR 2003) . Notable factors compromising the optimal isolation of symptomatic individuals may include inadequate hygiene precautions (such as the lack of appropriate protective apparel including face masks and other SARS-specific infection control protocols), variability of incubation period, lack of knowledge of the transmissibility of disease early in the outbreak, and, in particular, the vulnerability of health-care workers. Reports of frequent infection of health-care workers while caring for SARS patients in isolation points to inadequate hygiene precautions as a potential major factor in reversing the impact of isolation. This view is further supported by the fact that a major revision of the infection control protocols and a strict adherence to such protocols were needed to reduce, and eventually eliminate, the incidence of new infections in hospitals. Implementation of these measures led to the eventual elimination of all cases of SARS worldwide by August 2003. This provided optimism for global control of SARS, despite the recent re-emergence of a few new cases in China (CDC 2004; WHO 2004a,b) , which have been successfully contained.",

The nosocomial spread of SARS has been studied using models introduced by Lloyd-Smith et al. (2003) (discrete, stochastic) and Webb et al. (2004) (continuous, deterministic) . To gain an insight into the critical factors associated with the control of SARS in a community and the world, we develop a dynamic model to study the outbreak of SARS and its control in four affected regions, namely GTA, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing. The model is described in x 2 and the results of simulations are compared with available data in x 3. Finally, the implications for control methods are discussed in x 4.",

In addition, our model includes a net inflow of susceptible individuals into the region at a rate P per unit time. This parameter includes new births, immigration and emigration. Owing to the continuing inflow of travellers into the community during the SARS outbreaks, and the absence of a rapid and effective screening test, it is assumed that some of these travellers are asymptomatically infected and enter the community at a rate p per day. The parameter p can also model cases of animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV. Since the estimated value of p is small (see electronic Appendix B), we take p \u00bc 0 for the theoretical analysis. However, our numerical simulations allow p > 0. Brauer & van den Driessche (2001) provide analysis of the role of recruitment of infected individuals ( p > 0) on disease dynamics in simple models. The susceptible population is increased by the net inflow (recruitment) of individuals into the region and is decreased by natural death. The susceptible population also decreases following infection, acquired by contact between a susceptible and an infected individual, who may be symptomatic, asymptomatic, quarantined, or isolated. The transmission coefficients for these four classes of infected individuals are b, e E b, e Q b, and e J b respectively. Here, we use a basic transmission coefficient, b (which models both the infectiousness of SARS and contact rates), with modification factors for asymptomatic (e E ), quarantined (e Q ), and isolated (e J ) individuals.",

Overall, this indicates that all four regions displayed similar transmission dynamics and had similar levels of susceptibility to SARS. After the start of quarantine and isolation (but before strict hygienic measures being put in place), our results suggest that the value of R c is comparable in the GTA, Singapore and Hong Kong (R c \u00bc 1:08 to 2.8), but our estimate for the value in Beijing is substantially higher (R c \u00bc 4:03). This finding should be interpreted cautiously, however, owing to the limited data available from Beijing, together with possible inaccurate and/or underreporting of probable cases (see reports cited in Wang & Ruan (2004) ). Once an isolation programme of symptomatic individuals is in place, subject to strict hygiene measures (so that e J \u00bc 0), the estimated values of R c for each region indicate that the spread of SARS was rapidly brought under control, with the values from all four regions being essentially the same (where R c varies between 0.14 and 0.21).",

The axes for these plots are given as average days from exposure to quarantine (1=c 1 ) and average days from onset of symptoms to isolation (1=c 2 ). In both cases, the contours show that, as expected, the use of anti-SARS control measures (increasing c 1 and c 2 ) reduces the control reproduction number R c (and, therefore, SARS cases and mortality). With the remaining parameters set as for the GTA, and with e J \u00bc 0:36, quarantine and isolation are insufficient to control an outbreak (see figure 3a ). With these parameter values, as c 1 increases from 0 to \u00fe1, R c decreases from 1.83 to 1.59. Similarly, when c 2 increases from 0 to \u00fe1, R c decreases from 3.19 to 1.58. Thus, R c > 1 in both cases, and the disease will persist in the population (i.e. the above control measures cannot lead to effective control of the epidemic). By contrast, our study shows that with a perfect isolation programme (so that e J \u00bc 0), the outbreak can be controlled with isolation alone (see figure 3b ). Calculations show that with c 1 \u00bc 0, R c < 1 if c 2 > 0:16. It follows, that with this high value of e J \u00bc 0:36, neither the quarantine of asymptomatic individuals nor the isolation of symptomatic individuals can separately control the epidemic. Such control can be achieved by significantly reducing SARS transmission during isolation (i.e. reduced e J ). For example, by plotting R c against e J for the GTA, we find that the critical threshold value of e J needed to make R c < 1 is e J % 0:1927. This shows that unless the isolation programme at GTA is stringent enough to make e J less than the above threshold value, its usage will not only fail to offer effective control of the epidemic, it will also result in further (nosocomial) infections of healthcare workers and other caregivers. Lloyd-Smith et al. (2003) showed that for R 0 % 3 (as reported for SARS in Hong Kong) and the absence of contact precautions in hospitals, a SARS outbreak can be controlled only if isolation reduces transmission by at least a factor of four and the mean onset-to-hospitalization time is less than 3 days. The contour plot of figure 3c shows the dependence of the control reproduction number R c on the modification factor e J and the average days from onset of symptoms to isolation (1=c 2 ) for the GTA parameter values (note that c 1 \u00bc 0:1). It is worth noting that since the transmission parameter b is a product of the transmission probability per contact and the rate of contacts, it follows that the modification factor e J (for the transmission coefficient of isolated cases) also combines reductions (or increases) in transmission probabilities and contact rates during isolation. The efficient detection of SARS-infected individuals at points of entry into a community is a daunting task because of the lack of reliable virus-or symptom-based screening tests, human errors and the existence of unregulated points of entry. Thermal screening of passengers at transportation terminals has proven only partly effective. Our results suggest that, unless marked improvements in screening effectiveness were made, changes in protocols at points of entry would probably have had minimal effect. For example, if screening had been perfect throughout the entire duration of the epidemic in the GTA (after the first travellers brought SARS to Canada in February 2003), the cumulative deaths would have decreased by only five individuals; from approximately 38 to 33 (figure 4a). Thus, apart from the obvious benefits that strict screening might have had for preventing an outbreak initially, once the outbreak in the GTA began, better screening would have had a relatively minor impact on the epidemic's progression.",

It can be seen that both quarantine rate and isolation rate have a pronounced effect on the final outcome of the epidemic. Our simulations that mimic the actual outcome in the GTA are based on an assumption that the average time until isolation of a symptomatic individual is 2 days, whereas the average time until the quarantine of an asymptomatic individual is 10 days (the white dotted lines in figure 5 ). For these values, it can be seen that alterations in the rate of isolation have a stronger effect than alterations in the rate of quarantine. If the isolation rate were any lower, however (for example, an average of 10 days before isolation) then alterations in the rate of quarantine can have an equivalent or even greater effect than alterations in the rate of isolation. These results point to the conclusion that both isolation and quarantine are important, and quite effective, means for controlling The effect of the timing of implementation of quarantine and isolation on the cumulative number of deaths once SARS has been eradicated for the GTA. As with other results, we assume that strict hygiene measures were put into place three weeks after implementation of quarantine and isolation.",

In keeping with these facts, we develop a relatively simple compartmental deterministic model to study the transmission dynamics and control of SARS. The model incorporates many essential elements of SARS transmission but not the heterogeneity of contacts (caused by spatial considerations and age structure) that are also known to influence disease spread to some extent.

The standard pre-SARS infection control practices, although sufficient in controlling other infectious diseases, were unable to control SARS, presumably because of a lack of knowledge of the mode and transmissibility of SARS-CoV and the absence of anti-SARS immunity in the population. A major revision of the infection control guidelines and strict adherence to these guidelines (jointly referred to in this study as stringent hygiene precautions) were necessary to control the incidence of nosocomial infections and eventually control SARS.

Under such conditions, mass quarantine of individuals suspected to be exposed to SARS-CoV offers only marginal benefit. However, if the isolation is delayed (for example, starting 10 days after the initial outbreak), then quarantine of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV becomes equally, or more, important than isolation.
