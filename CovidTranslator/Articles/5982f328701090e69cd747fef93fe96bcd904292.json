In virus-infected cells in culture, a special membrane compartment is seen to accumulate. Our studies with rat liver show a similar response to temperature both in situ with slices and in vitro with isolated transitional endoplasmie reticulum fractions. With isolated transitional endoplasmic reticulum fractions, when incubated in the presence of nucleoside tripbosphate and a cytosol fraction, temperature dependent formation of vesicles occurred with a Ql0 of \"2 but was apparent only at temperatures greater than 12\u00b0C. A similar response was seen in situ at 12\u00b0C and 16\u00b0C where fusion of transition vesicles with cis Golgi apparatus, but not their formation, was blocked and transition vesicles accumulated in large numbers. At 18\u00b0C and below and especially at 8\u00b0C and 12\u00b0C, the cells responded by accumulating smooth tubular transitional membranes near the cis Golgi apparatus face. With cells and tissue slices at 20\u00b0C neither transition vesicles nor the smooth tubular elements accumulated. Those transition vesicles which formed at 3\"/\u00b0C were of a greater diameter than those formed at 4\u00b0C both in situ and in vitro. The findings show parallel responses between the temperature dependency of transition vesicle formation in vitro and in situ and suggest that a subP0Pulation of the transitional endoplasmic reticulum may be morphologically and functionally homologous to the 16\u00b0C compartment observed in vitally-infected cell lines grown at low temperatures.",

As with liver cells, both at 16\u00b0C and at 18\u00b0C, transition vesicles accumulated. However, at temperatures of 18\u00b0C and below, there was also an accumulation of smooth tubular elements of the endoplasmic reticulum in the peripheral cytoplasm surrounding the Golgi apparatus most often in near proximity to the cis face. We suggest this structure to be morphologically and structurally homologous to the 16\u00b0C compartment of virus-infected cells [21] . The smooth tubular endoplasmic reticulum elements seen with liver slices at temperatures of 18\u00b0C and below and especially at 8\u00b0C and 12\u00b0C also appear to be structurally homologous to the 16\u00b0C compartment seen in cultured cells. While the formation of a 16\u00b0C compartment by the isolated membrane fractions is not immediately obvious, preliminary indications are that the stalked vesicles or that some of the membrane blebs still attached to endoplasmic reticulum fragments seen in isolated preparations exposed to ATP and cytosol but not incubated at temperatures of 16\u00b0C and above may be the equivalent structures.",

At least in the cell-free [16] and perforated [1, 2] cell systems, vesicle formation and transfer shows an absolute energy dependence. Thus, an accumulation of vesicles under conditions of energy depletion would not be expected.",
