Here, we develop a mathematical model-Bayesian inference system which combines a simple epidemic model and data assimilation method, and use it in conjunction with data on observed human influenza A(H7N9) cases from to estimate key epidemiological parameters and to forecast infection in both poultry and humans. Our findings indicate a high outbreak attack rate of 33% among poultry but a low rate of chicken-to-human spillover transmission. In addition, we generated accurate forecasts of the peak timing and magnitude of human influenza A(H7N9) cases. This work demonstrates that transmission dynamics within an avian reservoir can be estimated and that real-time forecast of spillover avian influenza in humans is possible.",

Indeed, LPAI includes nearly all influenza subtypes, and wild bird migration can bring viruses to new areas and species [1, 4] . The LPAI A(H7N9) virus was first identified in humans in China in early 2013 [5] . As at 15 October 2015, 678 confirmed human infections have been documented, with a case fatality rate of ca 40% [6] . The virus most probably originated in wild bird populations [7, 8] , was introduced into domestic ducks and chickens and has since become well established in poultry populations in south-eastern China [6] . Transmission to humans occurs primarily at live bird markets (LBMs), where direct contact between humans and infected poultry leads to spillover transmission [9] .",

Outbreaks of human influenza A(H7N9) cases peak in winter months [10] and geographical diffusion from the eastern to the southern region of China has been observed [11] . As is true for most LPAI viruses, influenza A(H7N9) does not produce significant illness in domestic poultry, implying that poultry can be infected asymptomatically [6] . Consequently, poultry infections are likely to be under-reported even though LBMs are being closely and actively monitored [12, 13] . This limited, partial observation of influenza A(H7N9) infection in poultry poses a challenge to the study and quantification of the transmission potential of H7N9 viruses in poultry populations, as well as spillover transmission from poultry to humans. However, owing to the transmission link between influenza A(H7N9) infection in poultry and human infection through LBMs [9] , and because human influenza A(H7N9) cases have been well documented, these human cases serve as a sentinel proxy for infection rates among domestic poultry.",

Traditional methods of epidemic curve fitting regard the increase in cumulative cases as an exponential with set doubling times [14] . This approach uses surveillance data during the early exponential growth period of an outbreak to provide retrospective estimates of R0 [15, 16] . However, these estimates rely on specific assumptions, such as the initial susceptibility of the population and the infectious period. In contrast, a Bayesian approach [17] can provide continuous estimation of all system parameters without specific assumptions and is therefore more suitable for nonlinear epidemic modelling. In previous work, we used Bayesian inference methods to infer disease transmission dynamics, estimate critical epidemiological parameters, and generate forecasts of seasonal and pandemic human influenza (i.e. H1N1, H3N2, B) in both temperate [18] [19] [20] and subtropical regions [21] .",

Before integration with the model equations, each simulation (i.e. ensemble member) was randomly assigned an initial combination of state variables and parameters from specified uniform distributions (see below).

The ensemble was integrated until the time point of the first observation at which the run was halted and the EAKF algorithm and observation were used to update the ensemble mean and variance of the observed state variable (here incidence) according to Formula 4, as well as all the unobserved variables and parameters [19, 22] .

Our estimates of R0, among poultry were similar to those of past pandemic influenza viruses in humans (e.g. 1.2-2.3 for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09) [23] , which implies that influenza A(H7N9) has the potential to cause pandemics in chicken populations. This result is similar to earlier findings [24] ; however, our estimates for three other parameters, the mean infectious period, the basic reproductive rate and the chicken-to-human infection rate, were smaller, which may be due to the finer spatial and longer temporal scales used in this study, as well as the difference in modelling approach. Specifically, our study used a dynamic model, Bayesian inference framework and regional bi-weekly counts of human infections, covering three epidemic waves. Our findings thus represent more detailed, localised and long-term patterns of transmission dynamic than earlier work using least-square methods in conjunction with daily human infection data at the beginning of the outbreak at a national scale [24] .",

The transmission potential among chicken flocks and initial susceptibility decreased across three seasons in the eastern region, but remained stable in the southern region. These differences were dynamically consistent with observed outbreak severity in both regions and may have been caused by a difference in control methods implemented by the government. In the eastern region, approaches such as closing of LBMs [25, 26] and halting live poultry trade were implemented during the early stages of the outbreaks. This probably reduced chicken-to-human exposure and chicken-tochicken mixing and consequently may have attenuated the severity of the outbreak. On the other hand, for southern provinces such as Guangdong (where LBM closure was implemented later, in the second half of February 2014), co-circulation of a diverse array of avian influenza subtypes as well as multiple strains of H7N9 and H9N2 influenza viruses has been documented. This abundance of viruses creates an environment primed for influenza reassortment, resulting in diversified and more adaptive genotypes and a higher risk of infections in both poultry and humans [27, 28] and may therefore keep susceptibility high and stable across seasons.",
