            "text": "Different viruses can be responsible for similar clinical manifestations of respiratory infections. Thus, the etiological diagnosis of respiratory viral diseases requires the detection of a large number of viruses. In this study, 6 duplex real-time PCR assays, using EvaGreen intercalating dye, were developed to detect 12 major viruses responsible for respiratory diseases: influenza A and B viruses, enteroviruses (including enterovirus spp, and rhinovirus spp), respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses group I (of which CoV 229E and CoV NL63 are part) and II (including CoV OC43 and CoV HKU1), parainfluenza viruses type 1, 2, 3 and 4, human adenoviruses and human bocaviruses. The 2 target viruses of each duplex reaction were distinguishable by the melting temperatures of their amplicons. The 6 duplex real time PCR assays were applied for diagnostic purpose on 202 respiratory samples from 157 patients. One hundred fifty-seven samples were throat swabs and 45 were bronchoalveolar lavages. The results of the duplex PCR assays were confirmed by comparison with a commercial, validated, assay; in addition, the positive results were confirmed by sequencing. The analytical sensitivity of the duplex PCR assays varied from 10 3 copies/ml to 10 4 copies/ml. For parainfluenza virus 2 only it was 10 5 copies/ml. Seventy clinical samples (35%) from 55 patients (30 children and 25 adults) were positive for 1 or more viruses. In adult patients, influenza A virus was the most frequently detected respiratory virus followed by rhinoviruses. In contrast, respiratory syncytial virus was the most common virus in children, followed by enteroviruses, influenza A virus and coronavirus NL63. The small number of samples/patients does not allow us to draw any epidemiological conclusion. Altogether, the results of this study indicate that the 6 duplex PCR assays described in this study are sensitive, specific and cost-effective. Thus, this assay could be particularly useful to identify the main respiratory viruses directly from clinical samples, after nucleic acid extraction, and, also, to screen a large number of patients for epidemiological studies.",

For many years the diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections has been made by non-molecular approaches such as antigen detection by direct immunofluorescence and viral culture. These methods, although effective and often complementary, are time-consuming, labour-intensive and, often, lack of sensitivity or specificity [5e7] . Compared to classical methods, molecular methods have significantly improved the diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections as they offer high sensitivity and provide specific results within a shorter period of time and for a larger number of pathogens [8e14]. Consequently, a number of different molecular systems have become commercially available for fast and accurate detection of respiratory viruses [7e10,15e17].",

In addition, a pool was prepared containing 10 7 copies/ml of each positive control. This pool was then tested with each duplex real-time PCR. The results confirmed that each duplex could identify only its specific targets. Furthermore, in order to assess the intra-assay and inter-assay variability of each duplex real-time PCR, each clinical sample was assayed 3 times in the same run and all the positive samples were assayed in 3 different runs with reproducible results. Table 5 hRSV was detected in 8 (5%) patients, all children; CoVI was detected in 6 (3.8%) children while hAdV was detected in 5 (3.2%) patients, 4 children and 1 adult hospitalized in ICU. In this patient hAdV was detected only in BAL sample. PIV2 was detected only in the throat swab sample of 2 patients (1.3%), 1 adult and 1 child, and hMPV was detected only in the throat sample of 1 adult patient (0.64%). In 6 clinical samples 2 or more viruses were detected; in particular EV/hRV were the most common viruses detected in mixed infections (5/6) ( Table 6 ). All patients with mixed infections were children.",

Altogether, in this study 202 clinical samples from 157 patients, collected between September 2011 and February 2015, were analysed. A total of 70 clinical samples from 55 patients (30 children and 25 adults) were positive for 1 or more viruses. Influenza virus (23/157; 14.7%) was the most frequently detected respiratory virus, followed by EV/hRV (17/157; 10.8%). As regard influenza virus, in particular, 17 patients were positive for influenza A virus and 6 for influenza B virus. Seven patients positive for influenza A virus were hospitalized in ICU. In these patients the virus was detected in both throat swab and BAL. From 4 others adult patients, influenza A positives, only a throat swab was available; the other 6 influenza A positive patients were children. Influenza B virus was detected in 5 children and in 1 adult hospitalized in ICU, in both throat swab and BAL.",

A sixth duplex was performed to detect hAdV and HBoV. In particular, after RT of 10 ml of the extracted sample with random examers (QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) in a final volume of 20 ml, 2\u00c2 HRM PCR master mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was used for the amplification reaction. The reaction volume was 25 ml (12.5 ml of master mix, 1.75 ml of each primer [10 mM], 5 ml of cDNA or of extracted DNA and H 2 O to reach the final volume). After the initial activation step, 30 cycles of amplification (95 C for 10 s, 55 C for 30 s, 72 C for 10 s (acquiring Green)) were performed. For the melting analysis, a ramp from 65 C to 95 C was used, rising by 0.1 C each step. The reaction was performed on Rotor Gene 6000 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The primers specific for each virus are listed inTable 1.All duplex real time PCR assays were developed using standards prepared with reference strains obtained from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls (NIBSC) (CoV229E, hMPV, hRSVA2, PIV1, PIV2, PIV3, PIV4, hRVA) or already available in our laboratory (Influenza A and B strains, isolated and cultured in MDCK cells, and Coxsackie virus A6, hAdV type 2, CoV NL63, CoV OC43, HBoV, sequences obtained and characterised from clinical samples). The standards were prepared by cloning the selected sequences according to the standard protocol of pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). The plasmid DNA was purified by QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). To obtain the RNA standard for each virus, each product of the cloning was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA).
