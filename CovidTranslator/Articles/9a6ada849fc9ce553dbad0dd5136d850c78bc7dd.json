There are patients in psychiatric hospitals in China who have been infected with COVID-19, however, the knowledge and attitudes of psychiatric hospital staff towards infectious diseases and their willingness to work during the COVID-19 outbreak has not yet been investigated. This study was performed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of medical staff in two Chinese mental health centers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We included 141 psychiatrists and 170 psychiatric nurses in the study. We found that during the COVID-19 epidemic, 89.51% of the medical staff of the psychiatric hospitals studied had extensive knowledge of COVID-19, and 64.63% of them received the relevant training in hospitals. Furthermore, about 77.17% of participants expressed a willingness to care for psychiatric patients suffering from COVID-19 virus infection. Independent predictors of willingness to care for patients included advanced training and experience of caring for patients with COVID-19. In conclusion, this study suggests that increased attention should be paid to the knowledge and attitudes of medical staff at psychiatric hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

Other studies have suggested that the implementation of appropriate education and protective measures improved staff members' willingness to work (Stergachis et al., 2011; Qureshi et al., 2005) . Our study also revealed that advanced training was an independent variable associated with a greater likelihood to be willing to care for psychiatric patients suffering from the COVID-19. Therefore, we recommend that psychiatric hospitals in China should strengthen the training of staff on COVID-19-related information and practice. Some psychiatrists learned about COVID-19 from medical journals. Many research studies of COVID-19 have been published since the outbreak began (Bai et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) and psychiatrists can better understand the etiology, pathology, and treatment of COVID-19 from these reports.

More than one hundred patients with psychiatric disorders in Wuhan city have been infected with the virus. Psychiatric medical staff are faced with the task of treating psychiatric patients infected with COVID-19. The virus is highly infectious and has a fatality rate of about 4% in China (Chen et al., 2020). Because of the high risk of infection, psychiatric medical staff must work under great pressure when dealing with these patients. The knowledge and attitudes of medical staff in Chinese psychiatric hospitals regarding COVID-19 are important in achieving victory in the battle against the epidemic.",
