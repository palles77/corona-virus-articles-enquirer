The mission of each national laboratory system is to conduct real-time biosurveillance and effective laboratory-based diagnostics, as measured by a nationwide laboratory system able to reliably conduct diagnoses on specimens transported properly to designated laboratories from at least 80% of the regions in the country. In Taiwan, the national laboratory system for public health is well-established and coordinated by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which is the government authority in charge of infectious disease prevention and intervention. Through the national laboratory system, Taiwan CDC effectively detects and characterizes pathogens that cause communicable diseases across the entire country, including both known and novel threats, and also conducts epidemiologic analyses of infectious diseases. In this article, we describe the national laboratory system for public health in Taiwan. We provide additional information on the national influenza laboratory surveillance network to demonstrate how our national laboratory systems work in practice, including descriptions of long-term seasonal influenza characterization and successful experiences identifying novel H7N9 and H6N1 influenza viruses.",

            "text": "Influenza testing is one of 6 core capabilities that are critical for effective national laboratory systems. 1 Diseases caused by the highly infectious influenza virus occur annually, with seasonal variation in countries located in temperate regions. During seasonal epidemics, 5% to 15% of the worldwide population is typically infected, resulting in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year around the world. 2, 3 Influenza viruses are genetically diverse because of their high mutation rates, frequent reassortments among genomic segments, and tendency to jump between hosts. 4 They undergo continuing evolution through antigenic drift and antigenic shift, the 2 major processes responsible for the generation of a newly emergent influenza virus. 5, 6 Therefore, not only early detection of the presence of novel influenza strains, but also continuous and comprehensive virus monitoring are critical for disease intervention and early warning of pandemics like those that occurred previously in 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009. 7 In 2016, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC) conducted an International Health Regulations (IHR) Joint External Evaluation in support of the goals of the GHSA and to contribute to efforts to promote global health issues. The evaluation of the country's global health security capabilities was completed with assistance from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Center for Health Security. 8 In this article, we describe the national laboratory system of public health in Taiwan, including the frameworks of tiered laboratories and specimen referral systems for disease diagnoses. We also illustrate the national influenza laboratory surveillance network in Taiwan, which has been well developed to monitor the long-term circulating and evolutionary trends of influenza viruses and to detect any novel or unknown virus strains that may have the potential to affect public health. Examples of our work in long-term seasonal influenza characterization and previous success in the identification of avian-origin H7N9 and H6N1 influenza viruses are provided to illustrate how our national laboratory system works.",

The regional commissioned laboratories are located in the northern (n = 3), central (n = 2), southern (n = 2), and eastern (n = 1) parts of Taiwan, and they continually conduct influenza testing for clinical specimens taken from ill people in the community and collect viral isolates from infected outpatients.

Based on the long-term monitoring of collected isolates, TCDC can delineate the epidemiologic pattern of circulating viruses in a real-time manner, which clearly shows annual peaks in winter dominated by various virus types or subtypes; summer influenza peaks are usually observed as well ( Figure 6A ).

Virologic analyses on influenza viruses circulating in the community through the national influenza laboratory surveillance network. Influenza isolates collected from regional commissioned laboratories are sent to the national influenza center at TCDC for characterization of viral genetic and antigenic properties. Combined data from genomic sequencing and hemagglutination inhibition assays are used to identify the predominant and new variant virus strains; the antiviral susceptibility pattern of a virus is also inferred from sequences of a particular viral gene segment. Post-infection ferret sera are prepared routinely against both predominant and variant strains, which are used as reagents in antigenic analysis by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Figure 5 .

( Figures 6B-E) . Combined with data on viral antigenic characterization determined by a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, the vaccine mismatch rate of the H3N2 subtype in Taiwan is higher than those of the H1N1pdm09 and influenza B viruses (Table 1) . This supports past research showing that a higher genetic mutation rate was observed among the H3N2 viruses. 12, 13 Furthermore, successful examples of the laboratory surveillance system to promote health security include the timely detection of a new variant of H3N2 strain that caused a mismatch in the 2009-10 northern hemisphere winter vaccine, and also the research data reporting virologic factors that may have contributed to the previous large epidemic waves of A(H1N1)pdm09 or influenza B viruses that occurred in Taiwan. [14] [15] [16] Monitoring of viral drug susceptibility against neuraminidase inhibitors is also conducted routinely through the surveillance system by analyzing NA gene sequences of circulating influenza strains. Our results of long-term oseltamivirresistance surveillance in seasonal H1N1 viruses during the influenza seasons of 2005 to 2009 in Taiwan show that viruses carrying the H275Y substitution in their NA genes were sporadically detected in 2007-08 and had quickly reached 100% in 2008-09, consistent with the global situation. 17 After the 2009 pandemic, oseltamivir-resistant H1N1pdm09 viruses with the NA H275Y markers were also sporadically identified from hospitalized patients. 18 Detailed epidemiologic and virologic analyses revealed that all the viral resistance was obtained after Tamiflu treatment; no further viral transmission between infected patients was found. Notably, no oseltamivir-resistant H3N2 and influenza B viruses have been detected during recent years.",

The functionality of the tiered lab system is supported by the tightly connected specimen referral network covering the entirety of Taiwan and the reliable diagnostic capabilities of a well-organized laboratory quality management system. Similar to the global influenza surveillance and response system (GISRS) operated by the WHO, the national laboratory influenza surveillance system in Taiwan continuously monitors the evolution and antiviral susceptibility of influenza viruses to evaluate possible risks caused by their dynamically changing nature and provides laboratory diagnostics to maintain the sustainable detection capacity of the lab system. It also serves as a country-wide alert system for the emergence of novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential, particularly given recent successful identification of H7N9-and H6N1infected human cases.",

These surveillance efforts assist in early detection of such viruses and allow government authorities to engage in appropriate actions such as containment and decontamination for disease control. In addition to influenza, there are also comprehensive surveillance networks for viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal TAIWAN'S PUBLIC HEALTH NATIONAL LABORATORY SYSTEM diseases that have been incorporated into the national laboratory system to characterize both known and novel pathogens causing epidemic disease throughout the country. On the other hand, potential threats to public health caused by zoonotic pathogens are continuously increasing. Close working relationships between public health and animal health laboratories should be encouraged to achieve the ''One Health'' goal of the GHSA.",
