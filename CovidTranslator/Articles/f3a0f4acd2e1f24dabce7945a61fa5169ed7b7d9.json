HMPV is difficult to cultivate and limited published data describe the in vitro growth characteristics of the virus and its ability to replicate in different cell lines. Stability of HMPV to different temperatures or environmental conditions has not been described. Nosocomial infections due to HMPV have been reported, and thus the survival of infectious particles on environmental surfaces is important. We tested multiple cell lines for the ability to support HMPV replication both in the presence and absence of exogenous trypsin. The most permissive monkey kidney epithelial cells were LLC-MK2 and Vero, while the most permissive human airway epithelial cell line was BEAS-2B. LLC-MK2 cells were tolerant of trypsin and thus remain an ideal cell line for HMPV cultivation. Spinoculation significantly increased the infectivity of HMPV for cells in monolayer culture. Infectious virus was very stable to repeat freeze-thaw cycles and ambient room temperature or 4\u00b0C, while incubation at 37 \u00b0C led to degradation of virus titer. Finally, nonporous materials such as metal or plastic retained infectious virus for prolonged periods, while virus deposited on tissue and fabric rapidly lost infectivity. These findings provide guidance for laboratories attempting to culture HMPV and relevant information for infection control policies.",

However, there is no published systematic investigation of the replication of HMPV in continuous cell lines commonly used for research. Ongoing HMPV research would benefit from the ability to use cell lines from different tissues and species. Common classic virologic aspects of HMPV such as stability to temperature and freezing have not been reported. In this study, we investigated the capacity of multiple cell lines to support robust replication of HMPV. We determined the stability of the virus at different ambient temperatures and during freeze-thaw cycles. Finally, we studied the environmental persistence of infectious virus under various conditions.",

Infected cells were cultured in the same medium without serum but with 100\u00b5g/ml CaCl 2 and 5\u00b5g/ml trypsin (HMPV medium). In some experiments, the trypsin concentration varied. For virus infection, subconfluent cell monolayers in 6-well plates were washed twice with PBS and inoculated with 0.1ml of HMPV. The virus was allowed to adsorb for one hour at 37\u00b0C, with gentle rocking every 15 minutes. Wells were then overlaid with HMPV medium. The cells were checked daily for CPE using an inverted microscope.",

Cell monolayers were adsorbed with HMPV at MOI of 1, 0.1, and 0.01, overlaid with medium without removal of inoculum, and infected monolayers harvested for viral titration at different time points. Inoculation with a lower MOI led to delayed growth kinetics, with significantly reduced titers at 24 hours for MOI 0.1, and at 24, 48 and 72-hour time points for MOI 0.01 ( Figure 2A) . However, the titers in all three conditions became equivalent at 96 and 144 hours. Titers in all three groups declined slightly at 168 hours, likely due to deterioration of cells. Supernatant and cell monolayers were both collected and titered at the indicated time points, and the titer in supernatant was one to two log 10 lower than the cell fraction at each point ( Figure 2B) , showing that HMPV is highly cell-associated. Furthermore, the titer in either supernatant or cells was not significantly affected by washing off the inoculum after the one-hour adsorption (data not shown), suggesting that virus binding (if not fusion and entry) is complete within one hour. Therefore, for early time point experiments, inoculation MOI has a substantial effect, while for maximal yield of virus stock production the initial MOI is relatively unimportant.",

We infected BEAS-2b cells with HMPV using either the standard method of gently rocking virus inoculum on cells, or spinoculation of cells with virus at ~700xg. Twenty-four hours post infection, infected cells were distinguished from uninfected cells by staining for surface expressed HMPV fusion (F) protein, and the percentage of infected cells was quantified using flow cytometry. Spinoculation resulted in a significant 2-to 3-fold increase in the percentage of HMPV-infected cells compared to standard inoculation ( Figure 3) . We found at other MOI below and above this range (0.1 to 4.5 pfu/cell) that the increased efficiency of spinoculation was consistent (data not shown). Standard adsorption was slightly more reproducible in that variation observed between different experiments was lower than for spinoculation, as evidenced by the error bars in Figure 3 . The variation associated with spinoculation was greater with subconfluent target cells and repeat experiments at higher cell confluency were less variable (data not shown). Reflecting the findings in the MOI experiments, spinoculation did not increase the yield at later time points (data not shown). Thus, spinoculation increases the efficiency of HMPV infection and may be the method of choice for some experiments, as low-to-moderate HMPV titers often limit the highest achievable effective MOI.",

We found that HMPV replicates to high titers in two monkey kidney epithelial cells lines, LLK-MK2 and Vero, as well as the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. This provides an opportunity to confirm in vitro biology of HMPV in cells derived from two different tissues and two primate species. While many cell lines tested supported the replication of HMPV, most were poorly tolerant of trypsin and thus probably not suitable for routine laboratory work. We found LLC-MK2 cells to be resistant to trypsin and thus more amenable for most viral cultivation. We have previously found that the trypsin tolerance of LLC-MK2 cells makes them more sensitive than other cell types for primary recovery of HMPV from clinical specimens [2] . However, Vero cells have been used for production of several live attenuated vaccines approved for humans and thus might be preferable for vaccine-oriented research [36] . Notably, Vero cells did not support detectable HMPV replication in the absence of trypsin. This may explain the failure to identify HMPV in routine diagnostic virology, where Vero cells are frequently used. Other groups investigated the capacity of HMPV to infect different cell types, but most of these used measurement of viral RNA or fluorescent-focus assays to enumerate viral protein-expressing cells after 24 hours [28, 37] ; these techniques measure entry, RNA replication, and protein translation. We used methods that determine productive virus infection in order to determine the generation of fully infectious particles and viable multicycle growth.",

Infecting cell monolayers with a low MOI results in the maximal number of infected cells appearing at >72 hours. Conversely, the MOI of the input virus had very little effect on the titer of the virus at 96 hours in the range of 0.01 to 1.0 MOI. However, the increase in infectious virus titer was modest when inoculated with an MOI of 1.0. We speculate that this apparent lack of robust replication was due to persistence of the input virus masking an eclipse phase of viral replication. Several of the experiments presented here demonstrate the stability of the HMPV virion, supporting this interpretation. Thus, for production of high titered working virus stock, initial MOI is relatively unimportant. However, this data informs experiments of cellular biology of HMPV. Experiments designed to study early cellular immune and other signaling responses to HMPV are likely to have greater discrimination between virus-induced phenomena and background with a high MOI and a greater number of infected cells.",

This was not entirely unexpected, since several reports have used spinoculation and shell-vial culture techniques to detect HMPV in clinical specimens [41] [42] [43] . The centrifugation shell vial technique has been used to enhance the detection of many viruses [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . However, the quantitation of this method provides useful data for HMPV research. One challenge in studying cellular responses to HMPV is the fact that HMPV grows to modest titers, usually in the 10 6 -10 7 pfu/ml range. This limits the achievable MOI in an experiment; spinoculation provides a reproducible means to double the effective MOI. Thus, combining spinoculation with the highest achievable MOI is a useful approach to study early events in HMPV entry and replication.",

These data suggest that HMPV can be maintained at 4\u00b0C for hours during experimental procedures or processing of clinical specimens. Consistent with these findings, we have not observed a decrease in HMPV detection in clinical specimens maintained at 4\u00b0C for up to 24 hours (data not shown). Surprisingly, HMPV was quite stable to repeated freezethaw cycles, losing <1 log 10 pfu/ml over ten cycles. These experiments were performed on virus stock without the inclusion of additives shown to stabilize RSV, such as sucrose, MgSO 4 , or 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) [49, 50] . Thus, the results are in sharp contrast to RSV, where in the absence of stabilizers, RSV infectivity was reduced by >2 log 10 TCID 50 /ml after five freeze-thaw cycles [50] . In keeping with these data, we have found that HMPV stocks retain infectivity for months at \u221280\u00b0C storage without stabilizers (data not shown), in contrast to RSV losing 2-3 log 10 TCID 50 /ml within three months at \u221280\u00b0C [50] .",

In contrast, we recovered diminishing amounts of infectious HMPV from paper and tissue over time, and were unable to recover infectious virus from fabric. These data have important implications for transmission of HMPV and infection control. One brief report described limited data on HMPV persistence on environmental surfaces, but the data were based on qualitative RT-PCR and observation for HMPV CPE in culture for five days [51] ; data from many groups including ours has shown that CPE in primary culture is insensitive for HMPV detection. We used an inoculum of 10 4 pfu/ml to simulate the expected titer in nasal secretions for these experiments. It is important to note that biological substances present in human respiratory secretions also could affect the stability of HMPV, but we did not test for this. Our data show that substantial amounts of infectious HMPV can persist on nonporous surfaces for hours. This environmental stability and resulting nosocomial transmission has been well described for RSV [52] [53] [54] [55] . Thus, infection control measures for children with suspected or proven HMPV infection should follow recommendations for RSV infection control [56] . Since RSV and HMPV seasonality overlap considerably in most temperate regions [1] [2] [3] 5, 10, 57] , specific viral diagnostic tests would avoid nosocomial transmission of these two viruses between children due to the common practice of cohorting children with shared diagnoses.",
