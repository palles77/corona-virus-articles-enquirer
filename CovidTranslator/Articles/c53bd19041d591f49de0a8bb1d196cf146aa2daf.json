The list of properties that Plinius attributed to liquorice is highly significant. For example, he suggested liquorice as a remedy for asthma, malaises of the throat, ulcerations of the mouth, and even advised its use to combat sterility.

Jacobus Philippus (1390-1400) also elaborated on the beneficial effects in problems of the kidney and bladder (Jacobus Philippus, edition 1962). Durante later in his works reports various qualities and virtues, particularly underlining how it is of benefit in cases of scabies of the bladder and kidney pain, as well as to cure ulcers of the bladder and kidney (Castore Durante, 1585). Nicholas Culpeper (1616 -1654 stated that \"it . . . helps . . . diseases in the kidneys and bladder, and ulcers in the bladder . . .\" . The author also specifically mentioned in his treatise \"It is also good in all pains of the reins, the stranguary, and heat of urine\" (Culpeper, edition 1995) .",

According to legend this work is based on sources dating back to the Emperor Shennong (ca. 2700 b.c.). The reported indications include some which were common in Europe like: pharyngitis, cough, palpitations, gastric pain, ulcers in the intestinal tract and sores. In addition to this, an area of application not found in Europe is intoxication by drugs and poisoned food (Leung, 1993) . The latter indication of liquorice features also prominently in the Indian Ayurveda system. This is a system of medical knowledge including phytotherapy which started to be codified about 450 b.c. in India, while the oldest surviving Sanskrit text dates from about 500 a.d.

            "text": "In a trial for gastric ulcer disease (Bardhan et al., 1978) , however, liquorice did not demonstrate any benefit. The effects first reported by Dioscorides and Al Razi referring to beneficial effects on excessive tissue growth around nails, in the eye and in form of tumours have been confirmed in vitro by demonstrating that liquorice causes apoptosis. This is evident from its antineoplastic effect against melanoma and gastric cancer cells (Ma et al., 2000; Wang and Nixon, 2001; Kobayashi et al., 2002) . Besides the antiproliferative effects shown with liquorice, new useful applications have recently been described in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (Saeedi et al., 2003) , suggesting a potential role for the drug in allergic/inflammatory diseases of the skin. In addition, liquorice has been reported to be useful for inflammatory lesions induced by ultraviolet radiation (Fujita et al., 1980; Halder and Richards, 2004) .",

However, the relief and beneficial effect reported in fighting symptoms may suggest a rationale for the use of the drug today. Modern pathophysiological concepts of medicine and technology in drug development obviate this lack and provide a useful way of developing further indications for this ancient drug. The above-mentioned activities against viruses serve as a clear demonstration of this. A new branch of pharmacology now aims to find invaluable information through the search of ancient texts: the project is able to \"distill\" herbal texts to their utilitarian core (Buenz et al., 2004) .",
