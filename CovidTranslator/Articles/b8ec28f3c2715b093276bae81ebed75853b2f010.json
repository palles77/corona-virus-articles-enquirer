DNA fragments encoded by the gag and pol region were expressed in two rodent cell lines, LTK-and 8HK. Both stably transfected cell lines continuously produce recombinant proteins which react with HIV-specific antisera. The GAG precursor and a 39-kDa proteolytic fragment thereof were the major recombinant proteins detected. Expression of the gag-pol region leads to the production of the GAG-POL precursor. Ribosomal frameshifting at the HIV-1 shifty sequence to a typical extent could be positively demonstrated by an enzyme assay. Despite the presence of the viral protease within the GAG-POL precursors, proteolytic processing of the HIV-derived polyproteins was extremely inefficient. The efficiency could not be enhanced by overexpression of the HIV-l protease encoding region.",

            "text": "Molecular analysis revealed that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-l) has a typical retroviral genome organization consisting of the major structural genes gag, pol, and env flanked by regulatory sequences in the long terminal repeats (LTR) (Muesing et a/., 1985; Ratner et a/., 1985; Sanchez-Pescador eta/., 1985; Wain-Hobson et al., 1985) . In addition, the HIV genome encodes for several regulatory gene products. Some of these influence viral replication or infectivity (Haseltine, 1988; Peterlin and Luciw, 1988) . As is known for all retroviruses, the primary translation products of HIV-l gag and pol are a GAG polyprotein and a GAG-POL polyprotein, respectively (Robey et a/., 1985; Veronese et a/., 1988; Jacks et a/., 1988a) . Both precursor proteins of HIV-l are proteolytically processed with participation of the virus encoded protease. The GAG polyprotein gives rise to at least three components ~18, ~24, and pl5 (Mervis et al., 1988) . The maturation of the GAG-POL polyprotein results in the release of the protease, the reverse transcriptase, and the integrase (Farmerie et a/., 1987; Lightfoote et a/., 1986; . The HIV-l protease which is encoded in the 5' region of the pol gene is an 1 1 -kDa protein generated by autocatalytic cleavage from a larger precursor protein (Debouck et al., 1987; . The requirement of the viral pro- ' To whom reprints requests should be addressed. tease for the HIV-specific maturation processes has been demonstrated by independent experimental approaches. (1) Expression of HIV-l genome regions encoding GAG-protease, POL, or GAG-POL in certain heterologous expression systems resulted in the production of proteins with the same antigenic specificities and molecular weights as those found in mature HIV-l particles (Kramer et a/., 1986; Farmerie et a/., 1987; Le Grice eta/., 1987; Madisen eta/., 1987; Leuthardt and Le Grice, 1988; Overton et al., 1989) . (2) A protein chemically synthesized according to the protease coding sequence of HIV-l revealed the same substrate specificity as the viral protease (Schneider et a/., 1988) . (3) Mutations within the catalytic site of the HIV protease prevented GAG-POL processing in heterologous expression systems (Le Grice et a /., 1988; Seelmeier et a/., 1988) as well as in the authentic viral system (Kohl et a/., 1988) . The HIV-l protease belongs to the class of aspartic proteases (Toh et a/., 1985; Katoh et a/., 1987; Navia et al., 1989) . Biochemical and physical studies revealed a dimer structure of the active protease (Meek et al., 1989; Navia et al., 1989) .",

This system is based on the expression of an N-terminally extended firefly luciferase gene which requires frameshifting in order to be translated as a functional enzyme (Fig. 4) . This was done by replacement of the translational start codon by an HIV-l nucleic acid sequence extending from nucleotide position 2071 to 2096 (BH-10) including the frameshift site (construct B, Fig. 4) . To determine the enzymatic activity of the N-terminally ex- tended luciferase, an inframe fusion gene was used (construct A, Fig. 4) . To confirm the -1 frameshifting from construct B we have transfected construct C in which the luciferase coding region is fused in the -2 frame with regard to the translation initiation codon. The design of constructs B and C was done in a way to exclude the possibility that internal translational initiation or RNA splicing would have led to active luciferase. Figure 4 shows the frameshifting efficiency in BHK and 293 cells as determined by transient expression experiments. Identical results were obtained in stable transfectants from BHK and LTK-cells (Reil and Hauser, 1990) . The fact that the frameshifting efficiency is independent of the status of the transfected DNA excludes internal DNA rearrangements which could affect ribosomal frameshifting in stable transfectants. Analysis of luciferase activity in the transfected cells showed that the HIV-l-derived sequence is responsible for frameshifting. The efficiency of frameshifting was determined to be 1.5-49/o in hamster BHK and human 293 cells.",

From the immunoblot analysis with hyperimmune sera (Fig. 5) we further conclude that the 39 kDa protein consists of pl8 and p24 components.

Additional experiments were carried out to evaluate our findings on GAG-POL processing: First, we sequenced the protease encoding region within the expression construct p.gag-pol I. The results exclude the possibility that mutations in the protease region led to the production of inactive protease (data not shown). Second, since it is conceivable that protease expression leads to cytotoxic effects, the selection of stable transfectants encoding spontaneously mutated proteases is possible. We therefore performed transient expression experiments which exclude a counter selection against protease expression (Fig. 6A) . In BHK cells transiently transfected with (Wilson ef al., 1988) is fused with a short linker to the 5' end of the coding region of the firefly luciferase. Expression of active luciferase from plasmid B requires frameshifting within the HIV sequence. The same effect could be achieved by translation reinitiation (-1 frame). Such a reinitiation upstream of the shifty sequence would lead to translational termination at the stop codon, which is in front of the shifty sequence. In order to exclude translational initiation, downstream the shifty sequence expression of construct C, which contains a 4-bp insertion 3' proximal to the shifty sequence, was determined. The low expression of luciferase obtained from this construct indicates that significant translational initiation as well as -2 frameshifting does not occur. mRNA from plasmid A directs the translation of active HIV-luciferase fusion protein and gives rise to the specific enzyme activity of the fusion protein. The drawings represent mRNA from plasmids A, B, and C. The different reading frames of luciferase in relation to HIV-derived sequences are symbolized by different positions of the open boxes. Thick arrows indicate the resulting inframe proteins. Thin arrows depict the -1 transframe proteins. The expression of active luciferase from cells transfected with plasmid A, B, and C was determined. Luciferase expression is given as the percentage of the expression from plasmids B and C in relation to that from A. p.gag-pol I, the same expression pattern as in analogous stable transfectants was observed. Third, to prove that expression of the gag-pol sequence used in our studies can result in a HIV-specific processing pattern in mammalian cells, this sequence was transfected into two primate cell lines (COS and 293). Smith et a/. (1990) have shown with COS cells that cotransfection of the HIV gag-pol region including the RRE sequence together with a rev expression vector led to an efficient processing of p55 into the mature compounds. The expression of p.gag-pol IV, which corresponds to p.gag-pol I plus the RRE sequence, in both primate cell lines resulted in the production of the GAG precursor (rp55) and its mature cleavage products (rp24 and rp18), as well as a 39-kDa protein (Figs. 6B and 6C). Transient expression of p.gag-pol IV plus p.crev in BHK cells led to the same results as after transfection of p.gag-pol I (data not shown).",

We infer that in the transfected rodent cells the same translation signals of the gag-pol region are recognized as in the natural host cells of HIV. This is of particular interest regarding the biosynthesis of the GAG-POL precursor. For the translation of ~160 a ribosomal frameshift occurring within the gag-pol overlapping region has been identified (Jacks eta/., 1988a) . Detection of rpl60 in BHK cells suggests that the synthesis of the GAG-POL fusion protein is mediated by a ribosomal frameshift mechanism as it is assumed for HIV-infected cells. This was substantiated by expression of the HIV-luciferase fusion gene construct B, leading to a mRNA which requires a ribosomal frameshift event within the HIV-specific sequence to give rise to active luciferase. From the investigations of Jacks et a/. (1988a) and Wilson et a/. (1988) it is known that the ribosomal frameshift occurs with a frequency of 5-l 0%. A lower extent of frameshifting (1 .5-4%) was calculated from the expression of the luciferase constructs from both rodent and primate cells. From these results we conclude that retroviral ribosomal frameshifting does not qualitatively depend on species or tissue-specific factors and that it occurs independently of virus-specific components. Therefore frameshifting cannot be responsible for the observed unequal Gag precursor processing.",

The 24-kDa protein (rp24) and a 39-kDa protein are obviously cleavage products of the GAG precursor. The 39-kDa protein, which consists of pl8 and p24 components, was detected in transfected rodent as well as primate cells producing a GAG precursor. A protein consisting of pl8 and p24 was also found as an intermediate product during the cleavage of HIV-derived p55 in human lymphocytes (Metvis et a/., 1988; Veronese et a/., 1988). Our results from rodent cells prove that the production of this protein does not depend on the HIV protease and probably involves a cellular protease. Cellular proteases involved in the maturation of gag and pol encoded proteins have been ,postulated by others based on expression experiments in yeast (Barr et a/., 1987) insect cells (Madisen et al., 1987) and mammalian cells (Flexner et al., 1988) . Whether cellular proteases are involved in performing virus-specific proteolysis of the GAG and POL polyproteins in HIV-infected cells needs to be elucidated.",

In a second attempt we successfully enhanced expression of the viral protease domain by overexpression of an inframe GAG-POL fusion protein in BHK cells. In these cells we obtained evidence for a weak HIV protease activity comparable to that found in cells transfected with the native gag-pol region. The data suggest that the low or missing HIV protease activity in rodent cells transfected with the gag and pol genes is not due to insufficient expression of the HIV protease. We could further show that in primate cells, in contradiction to rodent cells, the expression of gag-pol leads to an efficient GAG-POL processing. Our results are consistent with recent reports which describe that the specific maturation of gag and pol encoded proteins does not occur with the same efficiency in different mammalian cell lines (Gowda et al., 1989; Shioda and Shibuta, 1990) . Currently, it is difficult to explain why proteolytic processing mediated by the HIV protease efficiently occurs in Escherichia co/i, yeast, and baculovirus expression systems but only in some mammalian cell expression systems using certain cell lines. Concerning our data, it is conceivable that GAG and GAG-POL processing in natural HIV host cells involves cellular mechanisms and/or factors which are distinct from those in the transfected rodent cells.",
