On another front, point-of-care infection diagnostic methods at the bedside are significantly lacking. Here, we used a newly developed protocol of integrating an exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collection device (PKU BioScreen) and Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) to investigate what bacterial pathogens can be directly exhaled out from humans. Exhaled breath condensates were collected from human subjects with respiratory infection symptoms at Peking University 3rd hospital using the BioScreen. The screened bacterial pathogens included Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant Stphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma Pneumonia, Chlamydia pneumonia, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The results were further compared and validated using throat swabs from the same patients by a PCR method.",

For the patients recruited from the hospital, seven types of pathogens were detected from 36.5% of them, and for the remaining subjects none of those screened bacterial pathogens was detected. Importantly, some super resistant bacteria such as MRSA were detected from the exhaled breath, suggesting that breathing might be also an important bacterial transmission route. Results from throat swabs showed that 36.2% of the subjects were found to be infected with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. maltophilia, S. aureus and MRSA. For the EBC samples, 33.3% were found to be infected with MRSA, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Depending on the initial pathogen load in the sample, the entire protocol (EBC-LAMP) only takes 20-60 min to complete for a respiratory infection diagnosis. For different detection methods and pathogens, the agreements between the EBC and throat swabs from the same patients were found to range from 35% to 65%. Here, we have detected several bacterial pathogens including MRSA from exhaled breath, and the developed protocol could be very useful for the bedside pathogen screening particularly in remote areas where resources are significantly limited or prohibited.",

            "text": "The exhaled breath condensate samples were collected using an exhaled breath collection device (PKU BioScreen) developed in our laboratory. Similar procedure for the device was used as described in a previous study . For the subjects (IDs: 1-36 and 87-100), they were asked to continuously exhale at a normal breathing rate for five minutes towards the device about 20 cm away from the subject. And then the exhaled breath can quickly form into tiny droplets on the hydrophobic surface on the top of the cooled unit. We collected all the droplets into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube for analysis by dragging a DI water droplet over the film. The collection device somehow works like an impactor, but with a positive airflow (not a vacuum) and also a large collection surface compared to the straw(the impactor jet). Therefore, the collection efficiency should be very high given the large pathogen containing exhaled droplet, and the standard impactor equation cannot be used here to calculate the d50. In our previous study, we have collected and detected influenza viruses such as H3N2 using the same device . Accordingly, the d50 for the device could be very small or at least it is able to collect breath-borne viruses. Even for different subjects with different exhalation velocities, they won't affect the performance much. Typically, we obtained about 200-300 \u00b5L EBC within 3 min collection for all subjected involved. In our work, the detection of pathogens was most intended for qualitative analysis, thus the absolute physical collection efficiencies of the pathogens played a minor role in our data analysis. Nonetheless, it is certainly interesting to characterize the physical collection efficiencies of the EBC collection device. In our work, if we used a device without the cooling step, the amount of EBC collected was very limited compared to that with cooling. Typically, one cooled unit can last for 3-4 subjects for EBC collection without substantially losing much of the EBC collection efficiency.",

We wiped the retropharyngeal wall of each patient (IDs: 1-100) using a sterile swab, and then transfer the swab into buffer quickly. Pathogens can be extracted into the buffer solution by vigorous vortexing for 15 min at a vortex rate of 3200 rpm (Vortex genie-2, Scientific Industries Co., Ltd.). 1 mL extracting solution was transferred into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube for detection. For each subject, we also collected the clinical data, including gender, age, health conditions, blood routine examination results and maximum body temperature (Table S1 ). As quality controls, we have also used a high volume sampler to take about 20 m 3 of the hospital room air which was further subjected to the LAMP method analysis in addition to blanks (DI water) as negatives. The EBC device utilizes a one-time use of hydrophobic film that can prevent cross-contaminations between patients. To further eliminate such a possibility, an upgraded version of the BioScreen is now equipped with an internal separator that sits between the collection wall of the device and the exhaled breath from the mouth. The separator is also a onetime consumable, and it can be changed for every patient. However, here we used the first version of the device that was reported in Xu et al. (2012) . Human sample collections were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Peking University (PU IRB, approval #: IRB00001052-15012), and informed consent forms were attained from all patients prior to the experiments described above.",

For the patients (IDs: 7-26), H. influenzae was detected in six samples (IDs: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12) out of 20 EBC samples (IDs: 7-26), while only four corresponding throat swab specimens (IDs: 7, 8, 9, 11) were found positive with the bacteria as shown in Fig. 1 , and the remaining results, i.e., the detection time) are listed in Table S1 (Supporting Info). As shown in Table S1 , for the patients (IDs: 7-26) using the LAMP for detecting H. influenza there was a 35% agreement (7/20) (negative or positive) between the EBC and throat samples collected from the same patients. To evaluate the performance of the LAMP method, the same samples were also analyzed using qPCR assay when detecting H. influenzae. As shown in Table S1 , there was a 65% (13/20) agreement if the qPCR method was used between two different samples. However, the advantage of EBC-LAMP protocol is that use of EBC might not need a sample pre-treatment.",

This finding implies that EBC could somehow serve as a better sample for LAMP analysis of bacterial pathogens in terms with detection time possibly resulting from its diluted medium, which is less complex than the throat swab. For example, it only took 20.6 min for the EBC sample (patient ID_7) with the highest concentration, saving 7.4 min compared to the use of the corresponding throat swabs from the same subject.

However, there were also several throat swab samples (IDs: 13, 15, 16, (18) (19) (20) (21) (23) (24) (25) (26) which were detected to be positive with H. influenzae while none of this was detected for the corresponding EBC from the same subjects as shown in Table S1 . Possible reason could be due to lower concentration level of the pathogen in the EBC sample compared to that of the throat swabs from the same subjects. This could arise from the variations in pathogen concentration during the EBC collection process among different patients. For these patients who were infected by H. influenzae, the proportion of neutrophilic granulocyte ranged between 52.0% and 90.0% as listed in Table S1 , and it is thus difficult to make a decision based on the empirical threshold 75% rule of neutrophilic granulocyte. Because there were mixed impacts from various factors for the clinical presentation of respiratory infections, it is rather difficult, if not impossible, to reliably predict the pathogen based on clinical signs and symptoms (Caliendo, 2011) . Nonetheless, to compare the performances of EBC and throat swabs in detecting pathogens we still need more samples. As a simple and non-invasive method, EBC is increasingly being utilized for early diagnosis of diseases, e.g., lung cancer, asthma, influenza and some other respiratory infections Papaioannou et al., 2011; Teng et al., 2011) . EBC has demonstrated great potential and advantages in disease screening and diagnosis when combined with gold standard methods such as qPCR and ELISA methods (Ahmadzai et al., 2013) . However, in addition to the false-negatives for low level pathogens, the qPCR method takes a longer time that could be up to several hours for detection (Falsey et al., 2013) . On the other hand, the LAMP method for detecting various pathogens has been attracting great attention recently owing to its higher sensitivity and lower detection limit. Compared to commonly used clinical specimens such as nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavages, nasopharyngeal aspirates or sputum, exhaled breath sample can be more easily collected. Accordingly, use of EBC samples together with LAMP (a relatively inexpensive solution) could be applied to rapid pathogen screening. Overall, results from Fig. 1 and Table S1 show that bacterial pathogens such as H. influenzae can be emitted into the environment via human breath, and EBC samples can be used for screening pathogens using both LAMP and qPCR with reasonable detection rates.",

For detecting MRSA in EBC samples, the results from LAMP and qPCR agreed at 99.9%, including only positive case (ID: 29). This high agreement was partially due to non-presence of MRSA in most EBC samples collected. When detecting FluA in throat swabs, four positive cases (IDs: 8, 10, 18, 22) were detected. Here, the main objective of this work was to evaluate the performances of EBC-LAMP and EBC-qPCR protocols for qualitative analysis of bacterial pathogens in different samples, not on their detection limits. However, in another work, we have fully evaluated the detection limits of qPCR and LAMP methods under controlled conditions for selected pathogens including those tested in this work.

The percentages and also #/# on the figure indicates the frequencies of the selected six pathogens that were detected in 25 throat swabs and 5 EBC samples shown in Table S1 .

As discussed above, H. influenzae was detected in EBC samples using the EBC-LAMP protocol developed in our work. One possible reason is that pathogen levels appeared to be lower in EBC samples than those in the throat swabs, thus the commercial device used here might not be able to detect them due to its detection limit. Besides, the commercial LAMP device (without disclosing their primer information) might have used different primers sets than what we have used as listed in Table 1 in our EBC-LAMP protocol. It is noted that we have also detected MRSA both in the EBC and the throat swab samples using the commercial device. At the same time, MRSA was also detected using the EBC-LAMP assay developed here. S. aureus, especially methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is now one of the most studied pathogens in community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections associated with high mortality, causing great concerns (Misawa et al., 2007) . Previous study has evaluated the airborne culturable MRSA in the Chinese public building, which demonstrated that MRSA could transmit in the ambient air (Li et al., 2015) . Nonetheless, the results from the commercial device further showed that different types of bacterial pathogens such as Pae, E. coli, and MRSA can be exhaled out.",

Results are shown in Fig. 3 , and patients were grouped together if they were either infected by the same single bacterial pathogen or a group of pathogens, such as H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus, S. maltophilia and MRSA. Clinical doctors often rely on the empirical diagnosis, with the normal reference ranges of white blood cells (WBC) and percentage of neutrophils are 3.5-9.5*10 9 cells/L and 40-75%, respectively. As seen in Fig. 3 , for all patients infected by bacterial pathogens except one patient infected by E. coli all their average WBC levels appeared to be in the normal reference range. Even for the leading pathogen H. influenza, all the patients (N=10) had normal WBC levels. However, in clinical settings, e.g., in a respiratory clinic, these patients were generally treated as viral infections because of the normal WBC level. This means that a lot of flu patients could have been mis-treated in the hospitals where the WBC-infection-type rule as discussed are used. On the other hand, it seems that average neutrophils values appeared to be slightly higher than normally expected, e.g., for those infected by the leading pathogen H. influenza, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. maltophilia and also the combination of E. coli and H. influenza. The results from Fig. 3 indicate that empirical experiences, e.g., use of WBC for diagnosis of infection type (i.e., higher for bacterial infections), could be leading to wrong decisions with respect to the diagnosis and treatments. Nonetheless, this work was intended to evaluate which protocols are more efficient in terms with rapidly screening respiratory pathogens, but not on the pathogen infection mechanisms.",

            "text": "H. influenzae, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were often predominant in both outpatients and inpatients with respiratory disease (Str\u00e5lin et al., 2005) . The H. influenza bacterium was first isolated by Pfeiffer during the influenza pandemic of 1890, and is a Gramnegative opportunistic bacterium which appears to be coccobacilli. In this work, in addition to H. influenza, we have also found that S. aureus, MRSA, P. aeruginosa and E. coli can be also exhaled out by the infected patients. The results from this work and other studies indicated that these pathogens could be emitted and transmitted through the exhaled breath, thus adding to additional risks of infectious disease transmission. In other studies, airborne and/or droplet transmission were identified as the major routes for spreading human and animal bacteria, such as E. coli, S. aureus, anthrax, K. pneumonia, and P. aeruginosa (Ijaz, Zargar, Wright, Rubino, & Sattar, 2016; Knibbs et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013; Pyankov et al., 2012) . The WHO used a pathogen size of 5 \u00b5m to distinguish between droplet and airborne (smaller than 5 \u00b5m) transmission of exhaled particles (WHO, 2007) . In a previous work, it was found that a bacterial concentration up to 7000 CFU/m 3 was detected in exhaled breath, including both viable and dead cells of various types . Among other bacteria, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Kocuria variants were found dominant in EBC samples collected from the healthy subject using a VITEK 2 system . In their work, SEM images revealed that most bacteria in exhaled breath are detected in the size range of 0.5-1.0 \u00b5m (smaller particles), which accordingly poses greater risk of airborne transmission once exhaled out especially for pathogens such as MRSA. In another work, it was shown that humans could emit millions of bacterial particles per min, among which 17% was from the exhaled breath with a fluorescent bioaerosol concentration level of (1.93 \u00b1 1.83) \u00d7 10 5 particles m -3 and a peak size at 1.5 \u00b5m (Xu, Wu, & Yao, 2017) . Besides, human activities could also re-suspend a huge amount of bioaerosol particles. Once the pathogens exhaled to the ambient air, they would be suspended in air for long periods of time, accordingly traveling to greater distances and increasing the respiratory infection transmission risk (Wurie, Lawn, Booth, Sonnenberg, & Hayward, 2016) . All these emissions either from nature or infected individuals represent important infection risks under certain conditions. However, most often even in the developed countries, the diagnosis of the infection type, the health professionals empirically rely on the white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil levels from a routine blood test and accompanying clinical symptoms such as headache, cough, and arthralgia (WHO, 2016a (WHO, , 2016b . In principle, this practice lacks the scientific evidence. Our results suggest that use of higher WBC value (e.g., if the WBC is normal or not) as an indicator for bacterial infection might not be accurate in terms with identifying respiratory infection type (bacteria or viruses). In practical scenarios, physiological conditions vary significantly with individuals that could have different immune status, age, medical history, genetics and infections by multiple agents (both bacteria and viruses). It is rather difficult to judge the infection type purely through routine blood examination and also some clinical symptoms. This problem has been going for many years without active solutions that have been developed. The lack of the solution often leads to abusive use of antibiotics. Here, the developed EBC-LAMP together with throat swabs was found to be useful and rapid for identifying the bacterial pathogens. As its applications, the developed method has already been used for identifying the bacterial pathogens in two medical cases which involved two children hospitalized in ICUs. For a child aged at 4 who was diagnosed as severe pneumonia and hospitalized in an ICU in an Inner Mongolia hospital, we have successfully detected Legionella pneumophila in his throat swabs using the method we have described here. And for another hospitalized -less-than-6-month baby in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in Beijing, MRSA, S. aureus and S. pneumophila had been detected in his throat swab sample. It only takes 40 min for the LAMP detection while the culturing method needs at least 3 days. The detection results could help the doctors make the appropriate decisions about the medical treatments, particularly for certain agents such as L. pneumophila and MRSA. For these two types of pathogens, most medications available might not work better, e.g., MRSA is now resistant to many antibiotics. Timely and accurate diagnosis of the respiratory pathogens could play a vital role in helping the patients recover from the illness. Overall, this work provides a feasible protocol for the rapid detection of respiratory pathogens, especially useful in some under-developing areas.",

            "text": "Our EBC-LAMP protocol was further validated and compared with the standard method qPCR. The results demonstrated that the EBC-LAMP method might be more sensitive than the qPCR. This was possibly due to the inhibition problems with the qPCR from the sample matrix, and samples often need to be several-fold dilutions to eliminate the impact before the amplification. In addition, the LAMP method uses two additional loop primers for detecting pathogens which not only accelerate LAMP reaction, but also further improve the kinetics and sensitivity of the LAMP reaction (Notomi, Mori, Tomita, & Kanda, 2015) . In addition to measuring the turbidity using an instrument, the detection results from the LAMP method can also be made to be judged and visualized by naked eyes due to the production of high concentration amplification product. For example, the white magnesium pyrophosphate precipitates generated during the strand displacement auto-cycling reaction could be easily seen at the bottom of microfuge tubes. Adding fluorescent dye SYBR Green I into the reaction tube could lead to the eventual color change. For example, reaction tube appears to be fluorescent color by the ultraviolet radiation for a sample that is positive for a specific pathogen; while for negative control or samples without pathogens the color won't change. In this way, it provides an easy way to identify the reaction results if the turbidity instrument is not available. The EBC samples are relative simple compared to the throat swabs that often need sample pre-treatment before PCR or LAMP analysis. Besides the LAMP method, we have also developed a new DNA extraction solution (involved in our LAMP method for onsite bacterial screenings) that does not require any re-agent and efficiently obtains the bacterial DNA within 5 min. The detailed method has been filed for a patent and will be reported elsewhere. Currently most studies focus on breath-borne viruses, but our study as one of fewer studies reports the release of bacterial pathogens from the exhalation. In general, when pathogens are exhaled out they become dried up immediately, thus possibly transmitting to other places. Our data were from a real clinical setting that has important impacts on the healthcare providers. In addition, our results contribute to the understanding to the hospital infections and also breath-borne pathogen transmission literature. Overall, the developed EBC-LAMP protocol has the great potential of being readily made available in remote or less developed regions where resources are very limited or prohibited.",

            "text": "By integrating a commercialized EBC collection device (PKU BioScreen) with the LAMP method, we have developed a rapid and efficient protocol for screening respiratory bacterial pathogens. The results from LAMP assay were shown to be generally consistent with those from the qPCR assays for the same samples, and the sensitivity of LAMP was found to be slightly higher than the PCR amplification. Using the protocol, we have shown that many pathogens such as H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus and MRSA could be emitted out from the infected patients via exhaled breath. Similar to other studies, our work also demonstrated that H. influenzae is the leading pathogen responsible for the common respiratory infections. However, their viability and infectivity after the airborne exposure need to be further investigated. Overall, the protocol is a rapid, effective and noninvasive method in diagnosis of infections pathogens, and has been successful in identifying bacterial pathogens for two hospitalized child in ICU. In the future, the protocol can be made to be portable and available for bedside use. Nonetheless, the results here using the protocol could be negatively impacted by the number of patients involved and also the distribution patterns of patients' gender, age and medical history. In addition, regardless of the methods tested, use of throat swab samples resulted in high positive rates for selected pathogens compared to EBC samples, which might be due to different sources of pathogens or different types of respiratory infections (lower or upper respiratory tract infections). And in our future work the EBC-LAMP protocol will be also tested for screening breath-borne viruses in addition to increasing the sample size of the patients for further improvements. Besides, the transport and the transmission of the exhaled pathogens could be also further explored using an aerosol monitor together with a molecular method or a biosensor.",
