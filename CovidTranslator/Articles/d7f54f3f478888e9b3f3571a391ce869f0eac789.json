The patient had a history of good physical health with no underlying diseases but had returned to Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, from Wuhan 1 week before. Physical examination showed fever, with a body temperature of 38.7\u00b0C, and the laboratory examination results showed a normal leukocyte count (5520/\u03bcL), increased neutrophils (76.2%), decreased lymphocytes (16.1%), elevated glucose (7.4 mmol/L), and elevated C-reactive protein (14.00 mg/L). The patient tested negative for eight common respiratory pathogens, which were respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza A virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, parainfluenza virus, and influenza B virus, and the influenza A antigen screening was also negative. Finally, he was diagnosed with 2019-nCoV based on the real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) amplification of the viral DNA from a sputum sample.",

He had a history of good physical health and no underlying diseases. Although the patient had not visited Wuhan recently, he had a history of contact with the patient described in Case 1. Physical examination showed fever, with a temperature of CT imaging showed small ill-defined ground-glass opacities in both lower lung lobes. The lesion in the left lower lobe was located in the subpleural region while the one in the right lower lobe was distributed along the bundles (Fig. 2) . Neither pleural effusion nor lymphadenopathy was found. (5) (6) (7) (8) . Transmission of 2019-nCoV is mainly via droplets but can also be through contact. People are generally susceptible to the 2019-nCoV infection and the elderly patients or those with underlying diseases are more seriously affected. The incubation period of 2019-nCoV is generally 3-7 days but no longer than 14 days, and the virus is infective during the incubation period. The main symptom is fever with a temperature > 38\u00b0C. Other symptoms include fatigue, dry cough, and diarrhea, and acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur in severe cases (9, 10).",

In case 2, the percentage of lymphocytes and CRP levels were normal, although this difference may be attributed to the milder symptoms of this patient.
