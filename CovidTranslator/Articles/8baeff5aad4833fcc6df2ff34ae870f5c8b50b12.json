In this study, we investigated the symptoms, herbal formulae, herbal drugs, and their relationships in this treatise based on a multi-subnet composited complex network model (MCCN). Syndrome subnets were constructed for the symptoms and a formula subnet for herbal drugs. By subnet compounding using MCCN, a composited network was obtained that described the treatment relationships between syndromes and formulae. The results obtained by topological analysis suggested some prescription laws that could be validated in clinics. After subnet reduction using the MCCN, six channel (Tai-yang, Yang-ming, Shao-yang, Tai-yin, Shao-yin, and Jue-yin) subnets were obtained. By analyzing the strengths of the relationships among these six channel subnets, we found that the Tai-yang channel and Yang-ming channel were related most strongly with each other, and we found symptoms that implied pathogen movements and transformations among the six channels.

In recent decades, the effectiveness of many herbal formulae from Shang-han Lun has been validated in molecular biology studies and they have been used widely as complementary medical therapies. For example, the integrated use of formulae from the treatise with modern medicine has proved effective in treating severe acute respiratory syndrome [5] . A study of Sinisan from the treatise demonstrated its therapeutic effect on chronic restraint stress [6] . The benefit of a Wumei pill treatment for typhoid ascariasis was also confirmed [7] . Xiao-chai-hu-tang was studied [8, 9] for the treatment of liver injury and chronic pancreatitis. Clinical practice data for Shang-han Lun formula prescriptions in Taiwan were also analyzed [10] .",

Thus, quantitative analyses of the symptoms and their corresponding herbal prescriptions could help practitioners to find the treatment codes that are hidden inside this treatise. There are 381 sections in the treatise, where syndromes and prescriptions are described in most sections. For example, in section 13, a group of symptoms comprising headache, stiff neck, chills, fever, and floating pulse constitute one syndrome. A group of compatible herbs called the Gui-zhi formula, which contains Ramulus Cinnamomi, peony root, prepared licorice root, fresh ginger, and Chinese dates, are prescribed for this syndrome. It is obvious that there are two types of entities (symptoms and formulae) and three types of relationships (treatment relationships between syndromes and formulas, syndrome relationships between symptoms, and compatibility relationships between herbs) in this treatise. Analyzing these entities and their relationships may provide us with a new way of exploring this treatise.",

Edges are defined as relationships between nodes, such as compatibility relationships between herbs, co-occurrence relationships between symptoms, or more complex relationships obtained by data mining methods [16] . Constructing homogeneous Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) networks containing one type of node is a popular approach. However, in [17] , a heterogeneous TCM network was studied with multiple types of nodes, including herbs, biomolecules, and syndrome. Our study was inspired by [17] , but our approach differs from their method because we used a multi-subnet composited complex network model (MCCN), which is a generalized complex network model for describing different types of entities and multiple types of relationships between the entities [18, 19] , to describe syndrome relationships between symptoms, compatibility relationships between herbs, and treatment relationships between syndromes and formulas. We investigated the topological characteristics of a composited network with multiple types of nodes and edges based on the degree of given relationships and the clustering coefficients of given relationships.",

In this treatise, the progress of a disease is classified as Tai-yang, Yang-ming, Shao-yang, Tai-yin, Shao-yin, or Jue-yin, which represent six different developmental stages of a disease. The three yang channels are located in the exterior parts of the body, whereas the three yin channels are found in the interior parts. Cold or wind stroke invasion will damage the three yang channels first. If the disease progresses or it is mistreated, the disease's symptoms will develop throughout the interior yin channels. For example, a sick man may have syndromes in the Tai-yang channel, such as headache, stiff neck, chills, fever, and a floating pulse, so the Guizhi formula may be prescribed. However, if the man is mistreated and he has Yang-ming syndromes, such as constipation, perspiration with fear of heat but no fear of cold and huge pulse, then this means that the disease has progressed to the Yang-ming stage. The mechanism of six-channel transmission is rather complex, so we tried to identify symptoms that imply the movement of a pathogen among the six channels. By dynamic reorganization of the MCCN, we obtained six channel subnets (Tai-Yang, Yang-Ming, Shao-Yang, Tai-Yin, Shao-Yin, and Jue-Yin). After determining the strengths of the relationships between the subnets, we analyzed the relationships among the six channel subnets to find symptoms that implied the movement or transformation of pathogens.",

Subnet G 1 has relationships between v 1 , v 2 , v 3 , v 4 , v 5 , and v 6 . The second relationships between nodes v 1 , v 2 , v 4 , v 5 , and v 6 are illustrated in subnet G 2 . The third relationships among nodes v 1 , v 2 , v 4 , and v 6 are shown in subnet G 3 . Given a compounding mapping, a composited network G will be generated. The compounding mapping indicates how the nodes and edges in G are generated. In Fig. 1(d) , the nodes of G are assigned as the union set of the nodes of G i and G j , and the edges in G are also the union set of the edges of G i and G j . The weight of an edge in G indicates the number of subnets to which the edge belongs. The weight of an edge indicates a compounding relationship between nodes. When the weight equals 1, this means that there is only one type of relationship between the nodes. Given a reducing mapping, such as an edge weight of 3, a reducing network G \u2032 will be obtained, as shown in Fig. 1 (e). Each pair of nodes in G \u2032 has three types of relationships. Next, we define the MCCN measures used for quantifying different types of relationships in the composited network. These measures were inspired by classical and frequently used measures, such as the degree and clustering coefficient.

These symptoms all belong to Tai-yang disease. The former four symptoms are general symptoms of Tai-yang disease.

Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the degree k and the average clustering coefficient c, which can be fitted by c(k) = 0.833-0.009k (R-squared = 0.600). Six channel diseases feature different symptoms. Thus, symptoms that belonged to the same channel were densely linked, whereas those belonging to different channels were sparsely linked. Therefore, nodes belonging to the same channel had a higher cluster coefficient, whereas nodes with higher k and smaller c values belonged to different channels. For example, fever belonged to Tai-yang, Yang-ming, Shao-yin, and Jue-yin; therefore, the degree of the fever node was high but its clustering coefficient was small because the symptoms of these four types of channel diseases didn't occurred simultaneously. The clustering coefficients of nodes with the highest degree are shown in Table 1 . We found that a high degree indicated a low clustering coefficient, and vice versa. Moreover, a higher degree indicated that a node belonged to more channel. For example, fever had the maximum degree and it belonged to three channels; therefore, its clustering coefficient was small.

The first two herbal drugs have a high degree and low clustering coefficient, whereas the latter two have a low degree and large clustering coefficient.

In [6] , the biomodular mechanism of black plum in chronic ulcerative colitis was confirmed. The effects of pepper tree peel are the same as black plum. Tian men dong is an ingredient in Ephedra formula and Cimicifuga decoction, which is prescribed for the Jue-yin channel. In this stage, an exterior pathogen enters the interior and inhibits the normal circulation of yang-qi (more details of yang-qi can be found in [20] ). The pulse is then deep and slow, so the patient will feel cold. Invasion of the lungs by phlegm-heat leads to throat inflammation and sputum with bloody pus. Tian men dong can clear heat away from the lungs, as well as nourishing yin and moistening dryness. Therefore, tian men dong is a good choice for treating throat inflammation and sputum with bloody pus. The effects of ting li zi include removing heat from the lung and relieving asthma, inducing diuresis, and subduing swelling. Pain in the chest is mainly due to pathogenic heat congealing pathogenic water in the chest, so ting li zi is prescribed for pain in the chest.

However, the six channels model has been developed and given new meaning during the process of self-perception. At present, there is no uniform understanding of the six channels. In this study, based on original data from Shan-han Lun, we studied the relationships among the six channels by network topological analysis. We found that some symptoms linked two of the six channels more closely.

Thus, quantitatively exploring the underlying principles of this treatise is meaningful and interesting. In this study, we analyzed the symptoms, prescriptions, herbs, and their relationships in this treatise based on a MCCN, which is a generalized complex network model for describing multiple types of entities and the different types of relationships among them. This model allows subnet compounding to obtain a ''large'' complex network with multiple types of relationships as well as reducing to ''small'' complex networks with special types of relationships. We found that the MCCN method was effective for describing and analyzing two types of entities (symptoms and herbs) and three types of relationships (syndrome relationships among symptoms, compatibility relationships among herbal drugs, and treatment relationship between symptoms and herbal drugs).",

The power-law distribution of the syndrome subnet reflected the important role of Tai-yang disease in this treatise. The nodes in the herb subnet with high degrees and low clustering coefficients were harmonizing herbs. The nodes in the herb subnet with symptom neighbors that connected with others were specific herbs for treating a syndrome.",
