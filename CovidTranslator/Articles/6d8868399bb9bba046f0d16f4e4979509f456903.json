In-depth exploration of these applications has only become possible after the establishment of reverse genetics techniques to rescue recombinant viruses from plasmids encoding their complete genomes as cDNA [2][3][4][5] . Viral cDNA can be conveniently modified in vitro by using standard cloning procedures to alter the genotype of the virus and/or to include new transcriptional units. Rescue of such genetically modified viruses provides a valuable tool to understand factors affecting multiple stages of infection, as well as allows for the development and improvement of vectors for the expression and delivery of antigens for vaccination and therapy. Here we describe a protocol for the rescue of recombinant NDVs.",

            "text": "Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus belonging to the Avulavirus genus 1 , is an economically relevant and thus widely researched and surveilled zoonotic agent, which can severely affect poultry farming all around the world. Although not a human pathogen, NDV has also been thoroughly studied beyond the veterinarian field both as a model paramyxovirus and due to its highly interesting, natural oncolytic properties 6 . Research on NDV greatly benefited from the development of reverse genetics techniques for single-stranded, non-segmented negative-sense RNA viruses, first described for rabies virus by Conzelmann and coleagues 2 . A variety of genetically modified NDVs, carrying foreign genes or modifications of their wild type genome have been widely studied ever since. Work with these recombinant viruses has been critical to characterize different virulence factors not only of NDV but also of other relevant human pathogens such as influenza A virus 7 -or the emergent Nipah virus 8 . Furthermore, a number of different studies have explored the use of these techniques to improve the innate antitumoral activity of NDV 6, 9, 10 , mostly by enhancing the immunostimulatory properties of the virus. Other relevant area of research on recombinant NDVs has been the generation of vaccine candidates against other viral diseases such as influenza 5, 11, 12 , HIV 13 , measles 14 , SARS 15 , or that caused by the respiratory sincytial virus (RSV) 16 . Amongst the various noteworthy advantages provided by NDV are the lack of preexisting immunity in human populations, the stability of the foreign genetic inserts, a lack of recombinatory activity and overall a high safety profile combined with the aforementioned natural immunostimulatory properties 17 . It's also noteworthy the potential use of recombinant bivalent vaccines in poultry, protective against both NDV and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses 11, 12 . This may be an excellent way to decrease the chances of the latter spreading from wild to domesticated animals, thus also helping to prevent a possible inter-specific jump of the dreaded avian influenza to humans. Finally, reporter-expressing NDV have been used for the evaluation of innate immune responses as well as the identification of interferon antagonist encoded by multiple viruses [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

            "text": "The rescue process of a recombinant, non-segmented, negative-stranded RNA virus basically consists on artificially forcing a viral replication cycle in a producing cell by transfecting cDNA encoding the minimal infective molecular machinery, known as ribonucleoprotein or RNP ( Figure  2 ). The RNPs consist of the viral polymerase (P and L proteins), the nucleoprotein (NP) and the full-length antigenomic RNA of the virus. This RNA+ antigenome is the template required for the generation of the complementary RNA-genomes, which, also associated with the rest of the proteins of the viral RNP, recapitulates the same infectious complex that a natural virus would release on the cytoplasm of the cell upon infection (Figure 2A) . From this step onwards, the viral cycle can proceed naturally and recombinant virions, encapsidating the modified genomes, will be generated ( Figure 2B) . Remarkably, transfection of the genomic cDNA instead of the antigenomic cDNA greatly impairs or completely abolishes 1 . Because of this, the location of the new transcriptional unit within the genome must be carefully chosen to achieve a balance between expression of the transgene and impairment of viral replication. Insertion between P and M genes has been used the most, though other sites have also been tested 13, 31 . Whatever the insert, the cloning into NDV cDNA needs to follow some rules to generate a rescuable construct: (i) any new gene to be included into the NDV genome has to be under control of the appropriate signals for the viral RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase. These sequences must be added upstream of the new open reading frame (ORF) so the polymerase can recognize the end of the previous gene (GE) and the beginning of the new transgene (GS), spaced by a single nucleotide intergenic sequence (IG). Addition of a valid Kozak (K) sequence to improve eukaryotic ribosomal translation is also recommended for better foreign protein expression 32 ; (ii) efficient replication of NDV, as for most members of the Paramyxoviridae family, is dependent on the genome length being multiple of six 33 ; therefore, any insertion into the NDV has to follow this \"rule of six\". If necessary, required additional nucleotides can be added downstream the new ORF; and (iii) the sequence of the transgene should be checked to find possible GE and GS like sequences which could impair rescue efficiency, transgene expression and/or virus viability. If present, these sequences must be removed by silent mutagenesis. The generation of recombinant full length cDNA following aforementioned rules is the first step in order to efficiently produce a genetically modified NDV as detailed here.",

Upon reconstitution of the antigenomic RNPs in the cytoplasm of the transfected cell, they can produce the complementary, recombinant genomic RNPs and a whole cycle can then start anew, ending with the release of recombinant viruses.",

For most of the cases, standard maxiprep purification of the plasmid DNA is enough, although difficult cloning and rescue processes, due to the size or nature of the transgenes, may be improved by purifying DNA through CsCl density gradient centrifugation. Transfection efficiency using Lipofectamine is usually enough for a successful rescue, though other transfection methods such as nucleofection can also be used. In any case, the ratio of the different plasmids needs to be strictly maintained (0.4:0.2:0.2:1 for NP-P-L-pNDV, respectively). Due to the laborious and somehow stochastic nature of the rescue process, at least 2-4 different wells should be transfected per construct to be rescued, and different clones of the same construct should be assayed.",

Beyond basic research, recombinant NDVs have a great potential as vaccine and oncolytic vectos, combining the possibility of carrying foreing genes in their genomes with a well assessed biosafety profile.

Infection of Mammalian Cells with the Recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara VirusExpressing the Bacteriophage T7 RNA Polymerase (MVA-T7) (Figure 4A, Day 2) Genome organization of Newcastle disease virus (NDV). The non-segmented, single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome of NDV is 15,186 nucleotides (nt) long and encodes eight different polypeptides in six transcriptional units: NP, P, M, F, HN and L plus V and W proteins, originated after shifts in the reading frame of the P ORF during transcription. Noncoding, regulatory sequences flank the genome in its 3' (leader) and 5' (trailer) ends. Further noncoding gene end (GE), intergenic (IG) and gene start (GS) sequences regulate the viral polymerase activity in between the different ORFs. Expression levels of the different genes on the viral genome depend on their relative location respect to the 3' end (i.e. NP transcripts are the most abundant, L transcripts the least), effectively creating a gradient critical for the virus' life cycle 1 .",

Absence of virus allows the formation of a red pellet in the bottom of the well.
