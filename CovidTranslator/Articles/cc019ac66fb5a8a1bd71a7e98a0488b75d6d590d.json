The mortality rate for patients with severe CAP is high, and the empiric antimicrobial regimen for this subgroup differs from antibiotic coverage recommended for less severe cases of pneumonia. Ultimately, the decision to admit a patient to the ICU must be based on clinical judgment; however, various indices have been validated to predict the need for ICU admission and can supplement clinical decision-making. The modified American Thoracic Society (ATS) rules define severe CAP by the presence of either one of two major criteria (septic shock or need for mechanical ventilation) or two of three minor criteria (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 90 mmHg, multilobar pneumonia, and PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 250). The British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend that patients with two or more of the following be considered for ICU admission: altered mental status, blood urea nitrogen > 19.1 mg/dL, respiratory rate 30 breaths/min, and either DBP 60 mmHg or SBP < 90 mmHg (CURB \u00bc confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure).",

Pathogens are identified in fewer than 50% of cases. Culturing the blood or pleural fluid in addition to respiratory tract specimens may increase the diagnostic yield. Furthermore, Legionella pneumophila can often result in severe illness; therefore, urinary antigen for L. pneumophila serogroup 1 should be measured. Whether or not a specific organism is identified does not appear to affect mortality; however, microbiologic data can be used to tailor therapy.",

A sputum Gram's stain specimen is considered satisfactory for interpretation when the neutrophil count is >25 per low-power field and <10 epithelial cells. There is some controversy regarding how the results of a sputum Gram's stain should influence clinical practice. The ATS recommends that this test be used to broaden antibiotic therapy to treat unsuspected organisms not covered by the usual empiric regimen. Conversely, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines suggest that empiric antimicrobial therapy be narrowed based on sputum Gram's stain findings. Keep in mind the diagnostic limitations of sputum Gram's stain and culture, including the inability to visualize atypical organisms, contamination by oral flora, and the difficulty encountered by some patients to provide adequate specimens.",

Risk factors for infection due to penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae include age older than 65 years, recent beta-lactam therapy, multiple comorbidities, alcoholism, immunosuppression, noninvasive disease, and contact with a child who attends day care. Several investigations indicate that penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae pneumonia (in the absence of meningitis) can be successfully treated with beta-lactam antibiotics without adversely affecting mortality unless the minimal inhibitory concentration is 4 mg/L. S. pneumoniae resistance against macrolides and fluoroquinolones is increasing. Clinical failures with macrolides are rare despite macrolide resistance; however, fluoroquinolones with less potency against S. pneumoniae are likely to be ineffective against resistant strains. 2.

A microbiologic diagnosis using quantitative cultures of lower respiratory tract specimens not only establishes the presence of lung infection, but also identifies the etiologic organism. Several studies have shown that unless antibiotic therapy was initiated or changed within 72 hours preceding sampling, antibiotics can be safely discontinued when quantitative cultures of lavage specimens are below the diagnostic threshold. Qualitative or semiquantitative cultures of the trachea rarely yield negative results due to tracheal colonization even in the absence of lung infection. A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of over 400 patients meeting clinical criteria for VAP showed that a diagnostic strategy involving bronchoscopic sampling and quantitative cultures resulted in significantly less antibiotic use and decreased 14-day mortality when compared with a clinical diagnostic strategy using qualitative cultures of endotracheal aspirates.

Individual institutions differ in patterns of antimicrobial resistance; therefore, many hospitals have antibiotic guidelines or antibiograms for empiric therapy based on likely pathogens and local antimicrobial resistance patterns.

A higher rate of recurrence was documented with the 8-day regimen when the infection was due to Acinetobacter or Pseudomonas species; therefore, VAP due to these organisms should be treated for 15 days.

Broadening empiric therapy may be indicated while awaiting the results of additional testing. All patients should have a repeat chest radiograph at this time.
