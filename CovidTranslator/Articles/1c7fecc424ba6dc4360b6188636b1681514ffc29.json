            "text": "Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is a wide-spread mechanism of inter-bacterial competition mediated by the CdiB/CdiA family of two-partner secretion proteins. CdiA effectors carry diverse C-terminal toxin domains (CdiA-CT), which are delivered into neighboring target cells to inhibit growth. CDI + bacteria also produce CdiI immunity proteins that bind specifically to cognate CdiA-CT toxins and protect the cell from auto-inhibition. Here, we compare the structures of homologous CdiA-CT/CdiI complexes from Escherichia coli EC869 and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis YPIII to explore the evolution of CDI toxin/immunity protein interactions. Both complexes share an unusual \u03b2-augmentation interaction, in which the toxin domain extends a \u03b2-hairpin into the immunity protein to complete a sixstranded anti-parallel sheet. However, the specific contacts differ substantially between the two complexes. The EC869 \u03b2-hairpin interacts mainly through direct H-bond and ion-pair interactions, whereas the YPIII \u03b2-hairpin pocket contains more hydrophobic contacts and a network of bridging water molecules. In accord with these differences, we find that each CdiI protein only protects target bacteria from its cognate CdiA-CT toxin. The compact \u03b2-hairpin-binding pocket within the immunity protein represents a tractable system for the rationale design of small molecules to block CdiA-CT/CdiI complex formation. We synthesized a macrocyclic peptide mimic of the \u03b2-hairpin from EC869 toxin and solved its structure in complex with cognate immunity protein. These latter studies suggest that small molecules could potentially be used to disrupt CDI toxin/immunity complexes.",

Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is one competitive mechanism used by some Gram-negative species to inhibit the growth of neighboring bacteria 1; 2 . CDI + cells express CdiB/CdiA two-partner secretion systems, which deliver protein toxins into target bacteria through a receptormediated process. CdiB is an Omp85 outer-membrane protein that exports and assembles toxic CdiA effectors onto the surface of CDI + cells. CdiA proteins range from 180 -630 kDa depending on bacterial species and form \u03b2-helical filaments that are predicted to extend several hundred \u00c5 from the inhibitor-cell surface. CdiA binds to specific receptors on susceptible bacteria and subsequently delivers a toxin domain derived from its C-terminus (CdiA-CT) into the target cell 3; 4; 5 . CDI + bacteria deploy a variety of CdiA-CT toxins with distinct activities. The CdiA-CT EC93 from Escherichia coli EC93 dissipates ion gradients by forming membrane pores 6 , but most other characterized CDI toxins have specific nuclease activities. CDI toxins from E. coli EC869 and Dickeya dadantii 3937 are potent DNases capable of degrading target-cell chromosomes 5; 7 , and CdiA-CT ECL from Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047 cleaves 16S rRNA to block protein synthesis 8 . CDI + bacteria protect themselves from autoinhibition by producing small CdiI immunity proteins that bind to the CdiA-CT and block its toxin activity.",

            "text": "Although toxin/immunity pairs within a given family are homologous, there is often considerable sequence diversity between members, suggesting that families continue to diverge and evolve. When viewed in the context of available crystal structures, it is apparent that residues at the interface of the toxin/immunity protein complexes are diversifying most rapidly. This phenomenon is exemplified by toxin/immunity proteins that are homologous to the orphan-11 (o11) CdiA-CT/CdiI pair from E. coli EC869 7; 9 . CdiA-CT o11 EC869 interacts with CdiI o11 EC869 through \u03b2-augmentation, in which the toxin domain extends a \u03b2-hairpin to complete a six-stranded anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet within the immunity protein ( Fig.   1A ) 7 . The sequences encoding the \u03b2-hairpin (corresponding to \u03b24 and \u03b25) are the most variable between members of the CdiA-CT o11 EC869 nuclease family (Fig. 1B) . Moreover, CdiI o11 EC869 residues that interact with the toxin are not conserved between related immunity proteins (Fig. 1C) , suggesting that each immunity protein is specific for its cognate toxin. Here, we use structure-function analyses to examine the \u03b2-augmentation interactions of two homologous CdiA-CT/CdiI complexes to study the diversification of CDI toxin/immunity protein interfaces. We find that the CdiA-CT/CdiI YPIII complex from 6 Yersinia pseudotuberculosis YPIII also features a \u03b2-augmentation interaction, however the precise intermolecular contacts differ substantially between the complexes. In accord with these differences, each CdiI immunity protein only protects against its cognate toxin, demonstrating that each pair is a distinct cognate toxin/immunity pair. Finally, we synthesized a macrocyclic peptide mimic of the \u03b2hairpin from CdiA-CT o11 EC869 and solved its crystal structure in complex with the CdiI o11 EC869 immunity protein. This structure forms the basis to refine the \u03b2-hairpin mimic to increase affinity with the goal of producing compounds that activate DNase toxins through sequestration of immunity proteins. and shares all of the predicted active-site residues (Fig. 1B) . Similarly, the CdiI YPIII and CdiI o11 EC869 immunity proteins share 49.1% identity, though CdiI YPIII contains a 10-residue insertion between \u03b11 and \u03b12 that is predicted to produce an elongated loop (Fig. 1C) . We solved the crystal structure of the CdiA-CT/CdiI YPIII complex to 2.1 \u00c5 resolution by molecular replacement using the structure of the CdiA-CT/CdiI o11 EC869 complex (PDB code: 4G6U) as a search model ( Fig. 2A) . As with other CdiA-CTs 7; 8 , the N-terminal region (residues Val1 -Gly173) was not resolved in the structure. (Fig. 2B) . The CdiA-CT/CdiI YPIII complex also contains a \u03b2-augmentation interaction in which the toxin extends its \u03b24/\u03b25hairpin into binding pocket within the immunity protein ( Figs. 2A & 2B) . However, in contrast to CdiA-CT o11 EC869 , which contains an ordered Zn 2+ ion in the active site 7 , no zinc was detected by metal Kedge absorption analysis of multiple CdiA-CT/CdiI YPIII crystals and the electron density spheres within the active site vicinity of CdiA-CT YPIII where not within zinc coordinating distances with the catalytic residues or would form a zinc tetra-or hexa-coordination sphere, and thus were modeled as water molecules (Fig. S2) .",

In addition, extensive interactions outside of the \u03b2-augmentation Fig. 2B ). In contrast, the CdiA-CT/CdiI o11 EC869 complex has a less extensive interaction network outside of the \u03b2-augmentation region. Loop L1 of CdiA-CT o11 EC869 has fewer hydrophobic contacts and one ionic interaction between Asp183 and Arg71 of CdiI o11 EC869 (Table S1 ). Together, these structures reveal overall conservation between the toxin/immunity protein pairs, but reveal important differences in the network of bonds that stabilize each complex (Fig. S3 ).",

CdiA-CT YPIII and CdiI YPIII form a high-affinity complex with K d = 16 \u00b1 1 nM, which is similar to the value (18 \u00b1 7 nM) previously reported for the CdiA-CT/CdiI o11 EC869 complex 7 .

Inhibitor cells that express the CdiA EC93 -CT YPIII chimera reduced viable target-cell counts more than 500-fold after four hours of coculture, but target cells that express the cognate CdiI YPIII immunity protein were completely protected from inhibition (Fig. 5A) .

Similarly, the CdiI YPIII immunity protein was unable to protect target cells from inhibitor cells that deploy the CdiA-CT o11 EC869 toxin (Fig. 5A) . We also examined competition co-cultures by fluorescence microscopy to detect DNase activity in target bacteria.

Therefore, we sought to crystallize and solve the structures of isolated toxins and immunity proteins to determine if the proteins undergo any conformational changes upon complex formation. Neither of the isolated toxin domains formed crystals, but we were able to crystallize and solve the 1.8 \u00c5 structure of an isolated immunity protein (CdiI Ykris ) encoded by the Ykris_10740 locus of Yersinia kristensenii ATCC 33638 ( Table 1) . CdiI Ykris shares 68.9% and 51.5% sequence identity with CdiI o11 EC869 and CdiI YPIII (respectively) (Fig. 1C) , and its structure superimposes onto CdiI o11 EC869 and CdiI YPIII with rmsd of 0.626 and 0.984 \u00c5 over all \u03b1-carbons (respectively) (Fig. S6 ). In addition, structural homology searches identified yet another immunity protein homolog (CdiI NMB ) encoded by the NMB0488 locus in Neisseria meningitidis MC58 (PDB: 2GKP). CdiI NMB superimposes onto each of the other immunity proteins with rmsd values <0.7 \u00c5 over all \u03b1-carbons (Fig. S6) . Collectively, these structures indicate that CdiI o11 EC869 homologues retain the same \u03b2-hairpin binding pocket architecture in the absence of bound toxin. This finding suggests that \u03b2hairpins are modular, raising the possibility that interaction specificity could be altered by exchanging \u03b24/\u03b25 (\u03b2-hairpin) sequences between toxins.",

We co-expressed CdiA-CT o11 EC869/Nlact and CdiA-CT o11 EC869/Ykris together with His 6 -tagged CdiI o11 EC869 and purified the tagged immunity protein by Ni 2+ -affinity chromatography.

Nowick and coworkers have previously developed macrocyclic peptides containing \u03b4-linked ornithine turn units that adopt a \u03b2-hairpin conformation and should be suitable to disrupting the CdiA-CT/CdiI complex 16; 17 . To test the feasibility of this strategy, we designed a macrocyclic peptide (MAC) that mimics the \u03b2-hairpin of CdiA-CT o11 EC869 . The MAC peptide contains residues corresponding to Lys242 -Ser253 of CdiA-CT o11 EC869 , which were connected through a d-linked ornithine residue (Fig. S1) . Biolayer interferometry experiments failed to detect a binding interaction between MAC and CdiI o11 EC869 ; and the MAC peptide was unable to promote DNase activity when added in ~10 3 -fold molar excess to the CdiA-CT/CdiI o11 EC869 complex in vitro (data not shown). Despite its low affinity for CdiI o11 EC869 , we were able to crystallize the MAC peptide in complex with the immunity protein and solve the structure to 2.0 \u00c5 resolution by molecular replacement (Fig.   8A ). As anticipated, the MAC peptide forms a two-stranded \u03b2-sheet, though there are only four cross-strand H-bonds compared to the five in the CdiA-CT/CdiI o11 EC869 complex. The ornithine turn creates a bulge that prevents formation of the fifth H-bond (Fig. 8B) . The MAC/CdiI o11 EC869 structure superimposes well with CdiI o11 EC869 (rmsd of 0.437 \u00c5 over all \u03b1-carbons), though helix \u03b13* is displaced 3.0 \u00c5 to create a slightly altered \u03b2-hairpin binding pocket (Fig. 8B) . Five MAC peptide side-chains form H-bonds or ion-pair interactions with the immunity protein, in contrast to the six direct interactions observed in the CdiA-CT/CdiI o11 EC869 complex. In the CdiA-CT/CdiI o11 EC869 complex, \u03b2-hairpin residue Ser247 interacts with the immunity protein. However, the corresponding Ser7 residue within the MAC peptide does not interact with CdiI o11 EC869 (Fig. 8C) . Additionally, the side-chain conformation of MAC residue Arg10 is altered compared to that of Arg249 in the CdiA-CT/CdiI o11 EC869 structure, resulting in a H-bond interaction with the hydroxyl of Ser80 rather than the backbone carbonyl of Phe75 in the toxin/immunity structure. The MAC/CdiI o11 EC869 structure establishes that structure-based designed macrocyclic peptides can bind in the CdiI o11 EC869 \u03b2-hairpin binding pocket (Fig. 8D) , forming contacts that mimic those found in the CdiA-CT/CdiI complexes.",

            "text": "CDI toxin/immunity protein pairs are diverse and comprise more than 100 distinct families. Even within a given family, there is considerable sequence variability suggesting that toxin/immunity protein families continue to evolve. This phenomenon is well illustrated by homologues of the CdiA-CT/CdiI o11 EC869 toxin/immunity protein pair. Alignment of 26 closely related toxin domains from this family reveals that nearly all of the secondary-structure elements are highly conserved (Fig. S3A) . The obvious exception is the \u03b24/\u03b25-hairpin, which mediates the \u03b2-augmentation interaction and is the least conserved element in the family. Loop L1 of the toxin domain is responsible for all other contacts with the immunity protein; but in contrast to the \u03b2-hairpin, this region is well conserved with five invariant residues (Arg189, Leu190, Pro19, Phe194 and Asp198). Although loop L1 is highly conserved, it interacts with immunity proteins using distinct contacts in the CdiA-CT/CdiI o11 EC869 and CdiA-CT/CdiI YPIII complexes. Loop L1 of CdiA-CT o11 EC869 engages almost exclusively in hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions, whereas the C-terminal portion of the CdiA-CT YPIII loop is dominated by direct H-bond and 13 ion-pair interactions involving residues Asp201, Ala203 and Thr204. The differences are striking because these three residues are also present in CdiA-CT o11 EC869 , yet do not form the same interactions. Similar phenomena are observed for the immunity proteins. CdiI strand \u03b23* anneals with the toxin's variable \u03b25 strand during \u03b2-augmentation; and accordingly \u03b23* varies between immunity proteins in the family (Fig. S3B) . However, CdiI strands \u03b27*, \u03b28*, \u03b29* and the intervening loops are highly conserved, yet this region interacts with cognate toxins using distinct molecular contacts. In several instances, highly conserved residues engage in direct H-bonds in one complex, but fail to make any intermolecular contact in another closely related complex. Therefore, even conserved sequence elements can be exploited to discriminate against near-cognate partners. The idiosyncratic nature of these interactions most likely explains why immunity-binding specificity cannot be switched through a simple exchange of \u03b24/\u03b25-hairpins between homologous toxins. (Fig. S3B) . However, these core interactions do not provide significant binding affinity for near-cognate toxin/immunity pairs. A final important parallel between the colicin E-class and CdiA-CT o11 EC869 DNases is that the immunity proteins both bind to exosites, leaving the nuclease active site exposed in the toxin/immunity complex 7; 18 . The spatial segregation of substrate and immunity binding sites presumably provides the flexibility to evolve unique protein-protein interactions while retaining catalytic activity. The fact that two unrelated DNase toxin/immunity pairs appear to be diverging rapidly suggests that this is a general and perhaps universal feature of toxin/immunity systems.",

            "text": "Protein-protein interactions presumably evolve through mutational drift followed by reciprocal changes in the binding partner to maintain overall affinity while the underlying molecular contacts change. Riley and colleagues have proposed a diversification-selection model to explain the observed diversity in E-class colicin/immunity protein pairs. According to their model, some mutations expand immunity function and allow the newly evolved immunity protein to not only protect against its cognate toxin, but also against the colicins released by other strains 26; 27 . Such mutations would appear to be rare, but have been identified and characterized experimentally 28; 29 . One striking example that supports this model is the Asp33Leu mutation in ImE2 immunity protein, which increases affinity for non-cognate colicin E9 more than a 3,000-fold 29 . The advantage conferred by the new immunity gene would provide the selective pressure to retained the allele and allow it to become fixed in the population. This in turn allows for subsequent mutations in the linked colicin gene. Further mutations in the colicin are predicted to produce \"super-killer\" toxins, to which the ancestral bacteria are not immune 27 . Thus, the evolved colicin/immunity pair kills ancestral cells, thereby allowing fixation of the new pair in the population. Multiple iterations of this process are predicted to eventually produce a family of divergent toxin/immunity pairs. Of course, mutations that disrupt the toxin/immunity protein complex should be lethal to the cell, so the pressure to retain high-affinity interactions is presumably a significant barrier to diversification. However, colicin/immunity protein complexes have some of the highest known binding affinities, with cognate pairs characterized by femtomolar dissociation constants 22; 25; 29; 30 .",

In contrast, the CDI toxin/immunity proteins studied here have much lower binding affinities with dissociation constants of about 20 nM for cognate pairs. Therefore, CDI toxin/immunity systems must exploit other biophysical mechanisms to avoid self-intoxication during evolution. One possible mechanism involves the over-expression of immunity proteins relative to the toxins. The majority (21 of 25) of CdiA-CT o11 EC869 homologues presented in Fig. S3A are encoded by truncated cdiA gene fragments that lack the N-terminal coding sequences required for secretion. These pseudogene pairs are termed \"orphan\" modules, because they resemble cdiA-CT/cdiI coding sequences that have been displaced from full-length cdiA genes 9 . Orphan cdiA-CT reading frames usually lack translation initiation signals, whereas the linked orphan cdiI genes have canonical ribosome-binding sites upstream of the initiating Met codon. These observations suggest that the toxins are expressed at very low levels, but the immunity proteins are highly expressed. Under these conditions, the selective pressure to retain immunity function would be relieved and allow the immunity gene to undergo drift without lethal consequences. This hypothetical scenario is supported by the observation that noncognate/mutated immunity proteins can fully protect cells when over-expressed 25; 31 . Therefore, we",

Although the current MAC contains pentapeptide strands, we have previously reported cyclic \u03b2-hairpin mimics containing heptapeptide and nonapeptide \u03b2-strands 37; 38 . Homologous MACs containing larger \u03b2-hairpin mimics and designed to achieve more contacts may allow rational design of a higher affinity macrocyclic peptide that specifically may disrupt toxin/immunity complexes within bacterial pathogens, setting the stage for the development of a new class of antibacterials.",

Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-labeled E. coli EPI100 cells were generated by integrating the yfp coding sequence at the gal locus. First, a genomic integration construct was made by amplifying the kanamycin-resistance cassette from plasmid pKAN 39 with primers Kan-1/Kan-2, followed by blunt-end ligation to SmaI-digested plasmid pBluescript. One plasmid clone was identified with the kanamycin-resistance cassette in the opposite orientation as pKAN, and this plasmid was termed pNAK. A fragment of galM was then amplified using primers CH3789/CH3790, and the product ligated to SacI/BamHI-digested plasmid pNAK to produce pCH2500. A yfp-galT fragment was amplified from E. coli DA28100 (a gift from Sanna Koskiniemi, Uppsala University) using primers CH3787/CH3788, digested with KpnI/EcoRI, then ligated into pCH2500 to yield plasmid pCH2503. The large KpnI/SacI fragment from pCH2503 was recombined into E. coli EPI100 cells that harbor plasmid pSIM6 as described 40; 41 . mKate2-labeled target bacteria were generating by integrating the coding sequence of mKate2 at the phage HK022 attP site using plasmids pDE1013 and pAH69 as described previously 42 .",

CdiA-CT/CdiI YPIII expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-Dthiogalactoside at an OD 600 ~0.8 and grown for a further 3-4 h before harvesting. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,500 \u00d7 g for 25 min and then washed with resuspension buffer [20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl]. Cells were resuspended and disrupted by sonication on ice in resuspension buffer containing 10 mg/mL lysozyme and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min followed by filtration through a 1.0 \u00b5m filter. Clarified lysates were loaded onto a Ni 2+ -charged HiTrap column (5 mL; GE Healthcare) or Ni 2+nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni 2+ -NTA) agarose resin (MCLAB) and washed with resuspension buffer supplemented with 10 mM imidazole. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole (10 -500 mM) in resuspension buffer. Fractions were collected, combined, and concentrated to a volume of ~500 \u00b5L using a 10-kDa centrifugal concentrator (Centricon; Millipore). Proteins were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column for the CdiA-CT/CdiI YPIII complex or Superdex 75 for individual immunity proteins (GE Healthcare). Gel filtration columns were equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl using an AKTA FPLC.

Denatured CdiA-CT toxins were collected from the void volume, refolded by dialysis into 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM NaCl, then concentrated on a HiTrap Q anion-exchange column and eluted with a salt gradient, yielding 95% pure CdiA-CT protein.

Crystallization and structure determination Protein crystals were grown by hanging-drop vapor diffusion, with drops containing a 1:1 ratio (vol/vol) of protein solution to reservoir liquor. Crystals were mounted and collected under cryoconditions with the addition of 40% glycerol as cryoprotectant to the reservoir solution. Datasets were collected at 70K at a wavelength of 1.0 \u00c5 and images were indexed, integrated and reduced using either iMOSFLM (CdiA-CT/CdiI YPIII complex) 44 or the HKL2000 suite (CdiI Ykris and MAC/CdiI o11 EC869 ) 45 .
