Our initial lead compound was identified via high-throughput screening of a diverse chemical library. We subsequently carried out structure-activity relationship studies, and optimized the lead structure to potent inhibitors that have shown antiviral activity against SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. Based upon the X-ray crystal structure of one of the potent inhibitors 24-bound to SARS-CoV PLpro, a drug-design template was created. Our structure-based modification led to the design of a more potent inhibitor, 2 (enzyme IC 50 = 0.46 \u03bcM; antiviral EC 50 = 12.5 \u03bcM). Interestingly, its methylamine derivative 49 displayed good enzyme inhibitory potency (IC 50 = 1.3 \u03bcM) and most potent SARS antiviral activity (EC 50 = 2.5 \u03bcM) in the series. We have carried out computational docking studies and generated a predictive 3D-QSAR model for SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors.",

The emergence of SARS affected more than 8000 individuals and caused 774 deaths within a few months. 6 Quite remarkably, the spread of SARS-CoV was effectively halted within months after the initial outbreaks through public health measures. Through a concerted effort monitored by the WHO, scientists determined that SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV. 2,3,3b The more recent isolation of strains from zoonotic origins thought to be the reservoir for SARS-CoV, emphasizes the possibility of a reemergence. 4, 5 It is quite alarming just how rapidly a contagious illness can spread in the more mobile and highly interconnected world of the 21st century. While there are no new reports of SARS cases, there is no guarantee that this outbreak will not strike again. Therefore, development of antivirals effective against SARS-CoV is important for future outbreaks.",

            "text": "The identification of biochemical events critical to the coronaviral lifecycle has provided a number of significant targets for halting viral replication. One of the early and essential processes is the cleavage of a multidomain, viral polyprotein into 16 individual components termed non-structural proteins, or nsps. These proteins assemble into complexes to execute viral RNA synthesis. 7 Two cysteine proteases, a papain-like protease (PLpro) and a 3C-like protease (3CLpro), reside within the polyprotein. They catalyze their own release and that of the other nsps from the polyprotein and initiate virus-mediated RNA replication. Since 2003, numerous biochemical, structural and inhibitor development studies have been directed at the 3CLpro enzyme 8 , which cleaves eleven sites within the polyprotein. Recently, we reported potent inhibitors of 3CLpro that have shown antiviral activity against SARS-CoV. 9 Recent structural and functional studies directed at PLpro have suggested potential roles for this protease beyond viral peptide cleavage, including deubiquitination, deISGylation, and involvement in virus evasion of the innate immune response. 10, 11 Furthermore, studies have shown that the homologous enzyme, PLP2, from the human coronavirus 229E, is essential for 229E viral replication. 12 Therefore, PLpro has emerged as a significant drug development target. Our screening of a structurally diverse library of 50,080 compounds led to the discovery of a noncovalent lead inhibitor 1 (7724772, Figure 1 ), with an IC 50 value of 20 \u03bcM as a racemic mixture. 13 Subsequent SAR studies and lead optimization provided potent inhibitor 24 (IC 50 = 600 nM) which also inhibits SARS-CoV viral replication in Vero cells with an EC 50 value of 15 \u03bcM. 13 In these studies, we also reported the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV PLpro bound to inhibitor 24, which revealed important molecular insight into the ligand-binding site interactions. We now describe the full details of our significantly extended studies that include the design, synthesis, molecular modeling, and biological evaluation of a series of inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro.",

Particularly interesting is the fact that the amine group in 24 is positioned at the opening of the cleft where it appears to come within hydrogen bonding distance to the hydroxyl of Tyr269. Furthermore, there are a number of water molecules present (see Figure 2 ) that occupy the pocket accommodating the (R)methyl substituent of 24. This suggested the potential for extending the methyl branch further into the pocket through the addition of polar substituents. As shown in Table 4 , we incorporated a dimethyl group in place of the (R)-methyl substituent, however the corresponding inhibitor showed a reduction in potency for SARS PLpro (compound 29, IC 50 = 11.1 \u03bcM). Based upon the X-ray structure, we then incorporated 5-methylamine substituents on the benzamide ring. The resulting compound 2 showed a slight improvement in inhibitory potency (compound 2, IC 50 = 0.46 \u03bcM) and antiviral activity (EC 50 = 12.5 \u03bcM) as shown in Table 5 . The addition of a methyl group to the amine group of 2, provided compound 49 which showed slightly decreased enzyme activity (IC 50 = 1.3 \u03bcM) but significantly improved antiviral potency (EC 50 = 2.5 \u03bcM). These results illustrate the importance of testing compounds not only for their ability to inhibit the purified protein, but also to assess their effects on cell viability and inhibition of viral replication in a cell-based assay.",

The three conserved water molecules found in both the complex crystal structure of compound 24-bound protein and the crystal structure of the apo enzyme are retained for modelling studies and are shown as red dots in the P5 binding pocket (see Figure 2B ). In docking studies, these water molecules are necessary for obtaining the crystal bound orientation of these compounds which positions the naphthyl ring of the inhibitor to be flipped upwards holding the loop (shown in cyan, Figure 2A ). In the absence of these three waters, the naphthyl ring tends to occupy the P5 pocket, shown in green, Figure 2A .",

QSAR studies are often employed as a standard method to determine valuable information for designing novel and potent inhibitors. An alternative approach to labor-intensive chemical synthesis is to develop a theory that quantitatively relates variations in biological activity to changes in molecular descriptors for each compound. The goal of our computational study was to develop a robust QSAR model that can predict and differentiate inhibition values of this series of inhibitors against SARS-CoV PLpro. Partial least squares (PLS) methodology was used for the 3D-QSAR analyses. The CoMSIA descriptors were used as independent variables and percent inhibition values at 100 \u03bcM were used as dependent variables in PLS regression analyses to derive the models. The predictive value of the models were evaluated by leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. To assist ligand-based structure design efforts, we used docking in conjugation with 3D-QSAR (CoMSIA) to investigate the SAR of 46 inhibitors with considerable structural diversity and a wide range of bioactivity against the SARS-CoV PLpro.",

Apart from these three conserved water molecules, two additional water molecules are located at the ridge by the P5 pocket in the inhibitor-bound form of the protein. As previously mentioned, by conducting extensive analyses both with and without water molecules bound to the structures, we determined that retaining the three conserved water molecules made a substantial difference in replicating the crystal structure binding geometry of compound 24 in docking studies. When docking was performed in the absence of water molecules in the P5 pocket, the study suggested that the naphthyl rings prefer to flip downward and probably find lower energy conformations in this pocket as shown in Figure 2A . In the inhibitor 24-bound crystal structure, two of the conserved water molecules hinder placement of the naphthyl rings in the P5 pocket and thereby flip the rings upwards. This position of the naphthyl rings fits nicely in the hydrophobic pocket and forms favorable interactions with the flexible loop residues. The five water molecules mentioned above are clearly shown in Figure 2B and were retained for the docking procedure prior to CoMSIA 24 model generation. In Figure 2B , the superimposition of the naphthyl rings of modeled compound 2 (green) and x-ray structure bound orientation of compound 24 (cyan) is clearly shown as obtained in the presence of the conserved water molecules.",

A successful CoMSIA model was built with a cross-validated q 2 of 0.678 and bootstrap R 2 of 0.984. It is imperative to mention here that without the inclusion of at least the three conserved water molecules, the docking geometry of the inhibitors does not align with the crystal structure (as shown in Figure 2A ).

The plot shown in Figure 3 shows the correlation between the experimental percent inhibition values of 41 compounds and the inhibition percentages predicted by the CoMSIA model. The contour maps generated, shown in Figures 4A-C, were mapped back to the topology of the active site to reveal that electrostatic, hydrophobic, and steric fields were in accordance with the distribution of the binding site residues. These contour maps should prove to be helpful in determining the incorporation of functional groups for the inhibitors that can extensively interact with specific binding pocket residues.

Initial lead compound 1 was discovered via high-throughput screening. This racemic compound has shown enzyme IC 50 value of 20 \u03bcM. The stereochemical preference for the R-isomer was established through synthesis and evaluation of optically pure inhibitors, and kinetic studies showed that the optically pure lead inhibitor is a reversible inhibitor of SARS-CoV-PLpro enzyme. In the absence of any structural information, initially our structure-activity-relationship studies and systematic modification guided by molecular modeling studies provided potent inhibitor 24. This inhibitor displayed enzyme inhibitory activity of 560 nM and antiviral EC 50 value of 14.5 \u03bcM in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. A protein-ligand X-ray structure of 24bound SARS-CoV PLpro provided detailed molecular interaction in the active site of PLpro enzyme. Based upon the X-ray structural information, our structure-based design led to identification of potent inhibitors 2 and 49. Inhibitor 2 has shown potent enzyme inhibitor activity of 460 nM and antiviral EC 50 value of 12.5 \u03bcM against SARS. Interestingly, the corresponding methylamine derivative 49 (enzyme IC 50 = 1.3 \u03bcM) has shown most potent antiviral activity against SARS (EC 50 = 2.5 \u03bcM). To obtain molecular insight into the binding properties of 2 and its derivative, we have created active model based upon the Xray structure of 24-bound SARS PLpro. It appears that the methylamine functionality is within proximity to hydrogen bond with the side chain residues of Gln270 and Tyr269. We have also carried out computational docking studies and generated predictive 3D-QSAR model for SARS-CoV PLpro. Further design of reversible SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors is currently underway in our laboratory.",

All ligand and water molecules except five, namely HOH2555, HOH2563 (conserved), HOH2590 (conserved), HOH2574, and HOH2595 (conserved) were deleted from the crystal structure of the ligand-bound form of the protease. Polar hydrogen atoms were added using the Sybyl package. 26 The 46 ligands were drawn using Chem 3D-Ultra 9.0. These structures were minimized in Sybyl7.3 by molecular mechanics with the Tripos force field to a gradient of 0.005 kcal/(mol A), after addition of hydrogen atoms to the ligands. The crystal structure co-ordinates of the bound ligand, 24, were used as a reference molecule for docking the other 45 compounds in GOLDv3.2 which allows full ligand flexibility and automatic consideration of cavity bound water molecules. The genetic algorithm parameters were all set to default except the number of the operations were increased to 500000 and the population size was incremented to 500. If the top three conformations generated by the docking software for the ligands did not differ from each other by at least 1.5A, early termination was allowed, ensuring non-redundant ligand conformations. The five water molecules were explicitly defined in the docking configuration file and were integral to the docking procedure and results. The top three conformations were saved for further analysis. The best scoring ligand conformation was determined as the final docked conformation for each of the 46 ligands and was used for the alignment in the proceeding QSAR analysis.",

Mulliken charges were calculated for these fully optimized structures based on the AM1 method in the Sybyl distribution of MOPAC. The resulting charged 46 molecules were aligned to each other for the CoMSIA analyses to explore the specific contributions of the effect of physicochemical properties on their bioactivities. By virtue of their similar docked conformations in the active site of SARS-PLpro, the overall alignment did not need much manual tuning. Using the QSAR module in Sybyl, a spreadsheet was created for the 46 aligned molecules. Five physicochemical properties namely, steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic fields, and hydrogen bond donor and acceptor were evaluated. Similarity indices were computed using a probe with a charge of +1, radius of 1 \u00c5, a hydrophobicity of +1. The default value of 30 kcal/mol was set as the maximum cut-off for steric and electrostatic energies. With standard options for variable scaling, SAMPLE method, leave-one-out cross validations were performed to determine the optimal principal component number. The cross-validation runs were carried out for 20 groups and the 10 round bootstrap run followed. The final CoMSIA model was obtained with this optimal number of components and non-cross validated conventional correlations. The training set was further tuned to delete five outlier compounds; this improved the model's q 2 value considerably. Hence, the resulting CoMSIA model training set consisted of 41 molecules including compound 24.",

In the x-ray structure of compound 24, the naphthyl rings are flipped up in the opposite direction, holding the flexible loop in place. The yellow dotted lines show the possible interactions of the docked compound 2 with residues Tyr269, Gln270 and Asp165 (catalytic domain residue numbering). (B) The three conserved water molecules are marked; two of them are buried deep in the pocket (P5) whereas the third one lies in a groove between residues Lys158 and Glu168.
