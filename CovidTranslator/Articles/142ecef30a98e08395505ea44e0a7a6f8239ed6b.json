The latter provides films of excellent adhesion that could tolerate washing under water jet. The scratch-proof coatings were characterized, and X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and N 2 physisorption indicated that the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) not only improved the coating properties of TiO 2 but also served as poragen to produce high surface area, mesoporous TiO 2 . The coated TiO 2 displayed better activity than the commercial P25 TiO 2 for photocatalytic oxidation of ethylene, ethanol, acetaldehyde, isopropanol and acetone. The catalyst also exhibited excellent bactericidal, fungicidal and virucidal activities against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungal spores and T2 bacterial phage. A simple photoreactor with tangential air flow was designed and tested in a chamber, before incorporating in a prototype air purifier. The study showed that there is good agreement between laboratory catalyst reaction data (i.e., 110 mmol h \u22121 for acetone) and the prototype test results (69 mmol h \u22121 ).",

There are extensive reports on the exposures and health impacts of various indoor air pollutants [2] [3] [4] [5] . Studies have shown that human exposures to indoor pollutants that exceed outdoor level by 2-5 times are not uncommon and in some situation, indoor pollution level can reach 100 times that of the outdoor [6] . A single exposure to high level indoor air pollution can cause headache and nausea, skin and eye irritations, respiratory difficulty, fatigue and even death for the case of carbon monoxide [6] , while chronic exposure to indoor pollutants such as radon, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), VOCs, particulates and bioaerosols can result in asthma, cancer, developmental defects and delays in children and weakening of the cardiovascular system in the elderly [7] . Thus, poor indoor air quality poses a greater risk to pregnant women, young children and elderly person.",

An improvement of indoor air quality in the United States of America is expected to save between US$ 7 and US$ 75 billion from lower health cost and absenteeism [9] . Even in the sparsely populated Australia, poor indoor air pollution is reported to cost AUD$ 12 billion annually [10] . Hong Kong, like most Asian cities is densely populated with more than 7 million people living on less than 1100 km 2 of land. The narrow roads and tall, high-rise buildings trap pollution resulting in poor air quality. This directly affects the indoor air quality, which is far more complex and dynamics due to its sensitivity to human habit. A recent study by Chau et al. [11] investigated the health benefit from indoor air quality improvements in Hong Kong residence and concluded that the use of air cleaners provided the greatest annual health benefit.",

Heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) has been investigated for decades and is considered an attractive technology for treatment of organic air pollutants (i.e., VOCs and malodors) and disinfection of airborne microorganisms at room conditions [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Ultraviolet (UV) light is generally used as the light source in the PCO processes, but new generation of visible-light active TiO 2 are also showing great promise [19, 20] . The most common approach is to coat the catalytic materials (usually nano-TiO 2 ) on substrates to increase the irradiated area [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . TiO 2 coating is therefore important to PCO performance. Coating delamination also poses a risk to environment and health [26] [27] [28] [29] . This work reports the preparation of nanostructured TiO 2 coating by screenprinting method to obtain scratch-proof photoactive TiO 2 coatings on surface. Tests on VOC removal and antimicrobial properties (bacteria and fungi) of the coatings made by screen-printing and wash-coating methods were performed in both laboratory and prototype air purifier.",

The peptization was carried out for 2 h, before cooling to room temperature to obtain a clear TiO 2 sol (step 2, Scheme 1) [30, 31] . Polyethylene glycol (PEG, ACROS, a.m.u. = 400) was added to the sol under vigorous mixing to obtain a coating sol sample (Sol A). A coating paste (Paste A) was obtained by evaporating the solvents (i.e., H 2 O and trace IPA) at 338 K. Coating precursor (Sol B) was also prepared by suspending commercial Degussa TiO 2 -P25 powder and HNO 3 (1.6 M) in a 50 ml of deionized and distilled water with [H + ]/[Ti 4+ ] ratio of 1 via ultrasonication. Powders of TiO 2 sol (steps 2 and 2 , Scheme 1) and Paste A (step 5 , Scheme 1) were prepared for analysis.",

The chamber was first cleaned and then purged with compressed air for at least an hour. Baseline measurements were made before introducing VOC into the chamber. The VOC was fed to the chamber by bubbling a sidestream of air into a series of three bubblers kept in a constant temperature bath, two containing the liquid VOC (i.e., acetone) and the last packed with glass beads. This ensured that the air is saturated with the organic vapor before dilution into the main air stream entering the chamber to give a VOC level of 4-10 ppm. After equilibration, the fan and UV lamp were turned on, and the temperature, humidity and VOC concentration were monitored with time.

An inordinate high level of formaldehyde was detected during the summer months and was attributed to the more frequent use of commercial disinfectants and cleanser in households following the SARS outbreak. This could explain the low bacteria count of the bioaerosol samples obtained during this period. The formaldehyde returned to normal level during the winter months when anxiety about SARS abated. This is also reflected by an increase in the mean level of airborne bacteria during the winter, however lower ventilation and frequent indoor activities (i.e., higher CO 2 ) also contribute to the overall increase in indoor bioaerosol. The results of the winter survey is more in-line with the earlier study conducted in 1999 by Lee et al. [36] . The particulate (RSP), formaldehyde and bacteria levels in both 1999 and 2003 winter surveys exceed the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department IAQ Excellent Class Standard of 20 g m 3 , 30 g m 3 and 500 CFU m 3 , respectively.

The particle size obtained from the diffraction peak broadening is consistent with the AFM result shown in Fig. 2a . The sol deposited on the atomically smooth surface of the freshly cleaved mica appears as round clusters embedded in larger aggregates. The addition of PEG polymer to the sol (Sol A) prevented aggregation as shown in Fig. 2b and improved the particle dispersion through steric stabilization [45] , but did not affect the particle size. Fig. 2c compares the nitrogen sorption isotherms for the TiO 2 powders obtained from TiO 2 sol (step 2 ) and Paste A (step 5 , Scheme 1). Both samples display a type IV isotherm that indicates the presence of framework-confined mesopores. The absence of a sharp rise in nitrogen uptake near the saturation pressure (i.e., P/P 0 = 1) means that there are few macropores in the samples [46] . In addition to being a stabilizer, the PEG also acted as poragen and the TiO 2 prepared from Paste A displayed larger surface area (235.7 m 2 g \u22121 ) and pore volume (0.3 cm 3 g \u22121 ) than sample obtained from the titania sol without PEG. The latter had a surface area and pore volume of 105.9 m 2 g \u22121 and 0.1 cm 3 g \u22121 , respectively. Fig. 3a shows a high magnification picture of TiO 2 -coated plate prepared from Sol A by wash-coating method. It is clear that a thin uniform layer of TiO 2 was obtained following air calcination. The X-ray diffraction in Fig. 3c detects only the support indicating that wash-coating produced an ultrathin coating on the plate. The micro-Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive surface technique and Fig. 4 shows the sample displays three weak bands at 400 cm \u22121 , 500 cm \u22121 and 630 cm \u22121 corresponding to anatase [47] . An aver- age TiO 2 crystal size of \u223c8 nm was estimated from the Raman peak broadening (14 cm \u22121 ) according to the procedure described by Iida et al. [48] . The commercial Degussa P25 TiO 2 was used for comparison. Although the primary particles of P25 are smaller than 100 nm, they form large agglomerate [49] resulting in thick and uneven coating on the plate surface as shown in Fig. 3b . The thick coating displays X-ray diffraction peaks corresponding to anatase and rutile TiO 2 [50] as shown in Fig. 3c . Diffraction peaks from the substrate are not detected, a further indication of thick coating. Unlike the plate coated from Sol A (Fig. 3a) , the adhesion of the coating is poor and the deposited TiO 2 are easily delaminated.",

The reaction rates obtained for samples coated from Sol A are higher than Sol B (P25-TiO 2 ) coated plates, and varies depending on the organic pollutants. The TiO 2 -coated plate from Sol A is effective against ethylene, ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetone. The gas chromatograph did not detect any byproducts and complete mineralization was obtained, except for 2-propanol from which a 10-20% is converted to acetone.

Fig. 6b plots the PCO reaction rates of acetone on TiO 2 -coated plates prepared by wash-coating of Sol A and screen-printing of Paste A. After each reaction runs that lasted for 8 h, the plates were removed from the reactor and subjected to a jet of compressed water (0.25 L/s) for 10 min. The plate was dried and returned to the photoreactor and its photocatalytic activity was re-measured. The TiO 2 -plate prepared by wash-coating suffered an immediate loss in activity after the first washing (Fig. 6b ), while the screen-printed plate maintained its activity even after the third wash. It is generally accepted that the hydroxyl radicals ( \u2022 OH) and superoxide (O 2 \u2212 ) species generated by UV light react and convert adsorbed organic molecules into CO 2 and H 2 O [12] . Therefore, the loss of TiO 2 catalyst from poor adhesion (i.e., wash-coated TiO 2 ) led to eventual decrease in PCO activity (Fig. 6b) . The release of TiO 2 also poses a threat to environment and health [26] [27] [28] [29] .",

Table 3 shows that except for N. sicca, better than ninety eight percent reduction in viable cells were obtained for the rest of the test bacteria under 5 J cm 2 UV dosage.

The 4 log reduction or 99.99% inactivation of bacteria phage T2 is obtained over the irradiated TiO 2 -coated plates. These data showed that current TiO 2 -coated plates have marked germicidal function under UV illumination.

A tangential air flow was used to achieve a higher mass transfer rate, but at an increased pressure drop as shown by the 3-dimensional, computational fluid dynamics model in Fig. 7a . The VOC concentration (i.e., acetone) in the chamber was monitored with time and plotted in Fig. 7b . The chamber displays a leak rate (i.e., natural decay) of ca. 30 ppb h \u22121 from an initial acetone concentration of ca. 9000 ppb. The leaks occurred at the chamber seals, which were replace after every ten runs. The chamber was allowed to equilibrate before the UV lamp is turned on. The tests performed on TiO 2 -coated plates prepared by wash-coating of Sol A and screen-printing of Paste A show both assemblies have similar high PCO activities (ca. 4000 ppb h \u22121 or 69 mmol h \u22121 ) and quantum efficiencies (79%). The experimental results were less than the theoretical conversion rate of 110 mmol h \u22121 from model calculation assuming ideal reactor conditions due to a lower mass transfer rate. However, the removal rate of 69 mmol h \u22121 from tangential flow was significantly higher compared to straight flow that had a measured conversion rate of 25 mmol h \u22121 (and quantum efficiency is 29%). The screen-printed plates were able to maintain a reaction rate of 55-78 mmol h \u22121 even after repeated washing.",

The tests were carried out at ambient temperature and conditions. Acetone and ethanol were evaporated and guided to the inlet of the air purifier using an air duct channel shown in Fig. 1c . The VOC concentration at the inlet and outlet were monitored during the 72 h experimental run, and the removal rate was calculated at steady-state. Acetone removal rate of 48 mmol h \u22121 was recorded at inlet acetone concentration of 10 ppm with a conversion of about 70% with complete mineralization. This conversion rate is comparable to the results of the chamber tests in Fig. 7b . The prototype removed ethanol at a rate of 23 mmol h \u22121 and formed CO 2 at a rate of 37.8 mmol h \u22121 , indicating that greater than 80% of the reacted ethanol converted to CO 2 . Tests performed on natural bioaerosol shows 36% reduction in viable bacteria and 60% reduction in fungi at the air purifier exit. The reduction was modest compared to the \"antibacterial-drop test\" results in Table 3 . This could be explained by the fact that in natural aerosols, microorganisms are carried by inanimate hosts such as liquid droplets and particulates that afford some degree of protection to the microorganisms. The coated plates were swabbed after the experiment and the results show that no viable microorganisms survived on the surfaces indicating the TiO 2 -coated plates have good antimicrobial properties.",

The TiO 2 coating must display excellent adhesion to prevent the loss of catalyst during operation that could lead to lower performance and avoid health and environmental hazards posed by the released catalysts. A scratch-resistant coating was developed based on screen-printing technique. The polymer paste contains non-toxic PEG polymer to improve coating properties and serve as poragen to enhance the surface area and mesopore volume of the coated TiO 2 . The coating process is solvent-free, clean and applicable to most surfaces. A more quantitative measurement of film adhesion would be important for coating optimization. The PCO reaction study showed that the new TiO 2 coatings are generally more active than the commercial P25 TiO 2 , however the reaction rates vary depending on the organic molecules. Reactions for pollutant mixture at environmentally relevant concentrations level (i.e.,<1 ppm) and humidity would provide better measure of the catalyst performance in indoor air. An unconventional approach was adopted in the design of the air purifier. Unlike traditional air purifiers that are designed to accommodate air purification technologies around an air handling system, the PCO reaction chamber was designed first and tested, before the air handling system was designed around the chamber. Thus, allowing us to optimize the PCO performance of the air purifier. This general approach is applicable to other environmental catalysts [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] .",
