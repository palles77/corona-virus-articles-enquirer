Whether such modification benefits new candidate vaccines has not been adequately investigated. We previously used retroviral vectors to generate wtH5N1 pseudotypes containing the wild-type HA (wtH5) from A/swine/Anhui/ca/2004 (H5N1) virus. Here, we generated mtH5N1 pseudotypes, which contained a mutant-type HA (mtH5) with a modified monobasic cleavage site. Groups of mice were subcutaneously injected with the two types of influenza pseudotypes. Compared to the group immunized with wtH5N1 pseudotypes, the inoculation of mtH5N1 pseudotypes induced significantly higher levels of HA specific IgG and IFN-\u03b3 in immunized mice, and enhanced protection against the challenge of mouse-adapted avian influenza virus A/Chicken/Henan/12/2004 (H5N1). This study suggests modification of the H5-hemagglutinin MBCS in retroviral pseudotypes enhances protection efficacy in mice and this information may be helpful for development of vaccines from mammalian cells to fight against H5N1 influenza viruses. Influenza; H5 subtype; Vaccine; Pseudotype; Hemagglutinin; Multibasic cleavage site It was first reported in 1997 that H5N1 influenza viruses were transmitted from birds to humans in Hong Kong, resulting in 18 infected cases and 6 deaths (Claas E C, et al., 1998; Subbarao K, et al., 1998) . As of March 12, 2013, 15 countries have reported 371 deaths among 622 confirmed H5N1-infected human cases, a mortality rate of about 60% (WHO, 2013) . Recently, two studies indicate that H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) have the potential to evolve directly to transmit between mammals and pose a risk of causing human pandemics in the future (Herfst S, et al., 2012; Imai M, et al., 2012) . Therefore, is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines against H5N1 HPAIV.",

It is initially synthesized as a single polypeptide precursor (HA0) and then can be cleaved into HA1 and HA2 subunits by trypsin-like proteases. The amino acids and the structure of HA0 cleavage site is a determining factor of viral pathogenicity (Chen J, et al., 1998; Senne D A, et al., 1996; Steinhauer D A, 1999) . Most influenza viruses can initiate infection only in the respiratory or intestinal tracts of the host as they have a monobasic cleavage site in HA, which can only be activated by extracellular trypsin-like proteases. However, highly pathogenic influenza viruses, such as H5N1 and H7N1 HPAIV, can spread throughout the host and cause systemic infection as they have a multibasic cleavage site (MBCS) in HA, which can be cleaved by ubiquitously expressed endogenous proteases in various types of cells (Horimoto T, et al., 1994; Okumura Y, et al., 2010; Stieneke-Grober A, et al., 1992) . The MBCS in the HA of H5N1 HPAIV is associated with viral infection and spread in both chickens and mammals (Horimoto T, et al., 1994; Schrauwen E J, et al., 2012; Suguitan A L, Jr., et al., 2012; Yin J, et al., 2013) .",

For inactivated vaccines, this modification changes the cleavability of HA, attenuates viral pathogenicity, but retains the antigenicity of HA (Subbarao K, et al., 2003) . On the other hand, this modification has been shown to have a deleterious effect on the immunogenicity and efficacy of the Delta H5N1 vaccine based on investigations of the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) cold-adapted (ca) virus in mice (Suguitan A L, et al., 2009) .

H5-HA pseudotyped lentivirus can also provide protection to mice (Zhang S, et al., 2008) . Previously, we used MLV-derived retroviral vectors, pHCMV-N1, and pHCMV-wtH5, a plasmid expressing wild type HA (wtH5) of A/swine/Anhui/ca/2004 (H5N1) virus, to package wtH5N1 pseudotypes from 293T cells (Tao L, et al., 2012) . Here, we generated mtH5N1 pseudotypes, which contained a mutant type (mtH5) and which contained a monobasic cleavage site with an amino acid 'T' replacing amino acids 'RRKRR' in the MCBS of wtH5 (Tao L, et al., 2012) . By subcutaneously vaccinating mice with the two types of pseudotypes, we compared the specific immune responses and protective immunity induced by them in mice and found that both influenza pseudotypes could provide protective immunity to mice, and mtH5N1 pseudotypes were superior to wtH5N1 pseudotypes.",

Mice were randomly divided into three groups (5 mice per group), and each mouse was vaccinated by subcutaneous injection for three times at 2-week intervals. In two groups, each mouse was immunized with wtH5N1 pseudotypes or mtH5N1 pseudotypes, comprising about either 3 \u03bcg HA or HA0 and diluted into 100 \u03bcL PBS. The third group was immunized with 100 \u03bcL PBS per mouse and used as a control. Before each immunization and on the 10 th day after the final boost, blood samples were collected from the lateral canthus of mice. Serum samples were collected and stored at -20 \u00b0C in aliquots. The serum level of anti-HA antibodies (IgG) was assessed by an indirect ELISA as previously described (Tao L, et al., 2012) . Briefly, purified prokaryotic recombinant HA1 protein (amino acids 1 to 329 of wtH5) with optimized concentration (1 \u03bcg per well in 100 \u03bcL coating buffer) were coated onto 96-well ELISA plates overnight at 4 \u00b0C.

In this study, we generated two influenza pseudotypes, wtH5N1 pseudotypes and mtH5N1 pseudotypes, which had different numbers of basic amino acids within the H5-HA cleavage site. In particular, the multibasic cleavage site of wtH5 was modified to be monobasic in mtH5. We found that these mtH5N1 pseudotypes, packaging mtH5 with a monobasic cleavage site, showed transduction ability only in the presence of exogenous trypsin-like proteases, displaying the HA0 precursor, inducing stronger humoral and cellular immune responses than wtH5N1 pseudotypes in immunized mice, and providing more effective protective immunity. This study demonstrates that modification of the H5-HA MBCS may be beneficial to the development of new candidate vaccines from mammalian cells to combat H5N1 HPAIV.",

Here, we generated influenza pseudotypes packaging mammalian expressed HA (wtH5 or mtH5) and N1 proteins around the core of MLV using a strategy similar to that previously described by Szecsi et al (Szecsi J, et al., 2006) . We observed that the transduction ability of wtH5N1 pseudotypes was independent of the presence of additional TPCK-trypsin, while mtH5N1 pseudotypes showed transduction activity only in the existence of exogenous TPCK-trypsin, similar to recombinant influenza A virus vaccines reported by Li et al. (Li S, et al., 1999) . As indicated by the results of Western blotting analysis, wtH5N1 pseudotypes display cleaved HA, while mtH5N1 pseudotypes carry the precursor HA0. We speculate the difference between wtH5N1 pseudotypes and mtH5N1 pseudotypes is mainly caused by the different forms of HA packaged by them.",

Additionally, mtH5N1 pseudotypes elicited a stronger humoral immune response and Th1 type cellular immune response than wtH5N1 pseudotypes, as sera IgG and IFN-\uf067 secretion were enhanced. We also found mtH5N1 pseudotypes were superior to wtH5N1 pseudotypes in providing protection to mice against an H5N1 influenza virus challenge. This is partly consistent with a previous study, in which modification of the multi-basic cleavage site of H5-HA to a monobasic one did not alter the antigenicity of H5-HA (Li S, et al., 1999) . But our results were different to those from another study, based on a live attenuated influenza A H5N1 cold-adapted vaccine virus which demonstrated modification of the multibasic cleavage site of H5-HA to a monobasic one had a deleterious effect on the immunogenicity and efficacy of the \u0394H5N1 vaccine in mice (Suguitan A L, et al., 2009) . These differences may be a consequence of differences in administration routes and variations in experimental details, especially the choice of specific immunogens employed in these experiments. The live attenuated influenza virus with a monobasic cleavage site in H5-HA can only replicate in the cooler upper respiratory tract and its action is restricted in the warmer temperature of the lung. Furthermore, the cleavage of H5-HA with a monobasic cleavage site and related virus activation is dependent on extracellular trypsin-like protease, while the live attenuated influenza virus with a MBCS in H5-HA replicates better in several tissue cells since it is independent of extracellular protease but dependent on intracellular endogenous protease. Thus, the former is less immunogenic than the latter and induces weaker responses afterwards in mice. Song et al. reported that influenza VLPs containing mutant HA without the multi-basic cleavage site (\uf044VLP) displayed an uncleaved precursor conformation, and elicited immune responses comparable to VLPs containing wild type HA (wtVLP) produced from baculovirus-insect cell system (Song J M, et al., 2010) . The authors speculated that \uf044VLP possibly provided superior protection versus wtVLP as evidenced by effective viral clearance. The present study shows results analogous to what Song et al. reported , and our conclusion is more reliable to support the hypothesis that the H5-HA with a monobasic cleavage site stimulates Enhanced protective efficacy of H5 subtype influenza retroviral pseudotypes vaccine Virologica Sinica|www.virosin.org 143 stronger immune responses in mice than the H5-HA with MBCS. As immunogens such as VLPs and pseudotypes cannot replicate in immunized mice, the immune responses are induced only once upon vaccination and are different from live attenuated vaccines which can reproduce immunogens until they are cleared by the host.",

Observations of the cellular immune response to influenza A virus suggest that there are two distinct pathways of protein antigen presentation to T lymphocytes (Braciale T J, et al., 1987) . We suspect that the form of HA may affect the antigen presentation pathway of influenza pseudotypes as an earlier report showed that cleavage of HA0 results in structural rearrangements to facilitate conformation change for fusion (Chen J, et al., 1998) . While wtH5N1 pseudotypes with cleaved HA1 and HA2 could fuse with antigenpresenting cells (APCs) and facilitate their entry, mtH5N1 pseudotypes remain inactivated and may not fuse with APCs in the absence of exogenous trypsin-like proteases. Another reason may be that mtH5N1 pseudotypes are superior to wtH5N1 pseudotypes in quantity, or stability, or both. However, definitive causes have to be investigated more extensively by additional experiments.",

Results are expressed as mean \uf0b1 SD (n \uf03d 5). B: On the 10 th day after the final boost, spleens were separated from three sacrificed mice of each group. Splenocytes were isolated and stimulated with recombinant HA1 protein in ELISPOT assay to score IFN-\u03b3 producing cells. The results are expressed as the number of spot forming cells (SFC) per 10 6 cells. The values represent the average of triplicate wells of three mice, and are displayed as mean \uf0b1 SD (n \uf03d 3). Compared with the group immunized with wtH5N1 pseudotypes, the levels of serum IgG after each boost and the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 after the final boost were significantly higher in the group immunized with mtH5N1 pseudotypes (* P < 0.05).",
