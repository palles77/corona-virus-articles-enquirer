Was anyone listening? It took 6 weeks until WHO deemed Ebola a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' and called for a coordinated international response. Countries facing occasional imported cases were in a panic about how to respond at home, while thousands of people in West Africa became infected with Ebola.",
