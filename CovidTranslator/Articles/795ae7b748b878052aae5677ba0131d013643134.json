            "text": "Respiratory viruses cause asthma exacerbations. Because eosinophils are the prominent leukocytes in the airways of 60-70% of patients with asthma, we evaluated the effects of eosinophils on a common respiratory virus, parainfluenza 1, in the lung. Eosinophils recruited to the airways of wild-type mice after ovalbumin sensitization and challenge significantly decreased parainfluenza virus RNA in the lungs 4 days after infection compared with nonsensitized animals. This antiviral effect was also seen in IL-5 transgenic mice with an abundance of airway eosinophils (NJ.1726) but was lost in transgenic eosinophil-deficient mice (PHIL) and in IL-5 transgenic mice crossed with eosinophil-deficient mice (NJ.1726-PHIL). Loss of the eosinophil granule protein eosinophil peroxidase, using eosinophil peroxidase-deficient transgenic mice, did not reduce eosinophils' antiviral effect. Eosinophil antiviral mechanisms were also explored in vitro. Isolated human eosinophils significantly reduced parainfluenza virus titers. This effect did not involve degradation of viral RNA by eosinophil granule RNases. However, eosinophils treated with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor lost their antiviral activity, suggesting eosinophils attenuate viral infectivity through production of nitric oxide. Consequently, eosinophil nitric oxide production was measured with an intracellular fluorescent probe. Eosinophils produced nitric oxide in response to virus and to a synthetic agonist of the virus-sensing innate immune receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7. IFNg increased expression of eosinophil TLR7 and potentiated TLR7-induced nitric oxide production. These results suggest that eosinophils promote viral clearance in the lung and contribute to innate immune responses against respiratory virus infections in humans.",

Moreover, prevention and treatment for the most common cause of asthma exacerbations, respiratory virus infections, are virtually nonexistent (11) . These deficiencies highlight our limited understanding of eosinophil biology, and have prompted studies attempting to define the role of eosinophils during respiratory virus infections in asthma. For example, IL-5 transgenic mice with elevated systemic eosinophils had lower titers of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) compared with wildtype mice (12) , whereas IL-5 transgenic mice with airway eosinophilia had lower titers of pneumonia virus in mice compared with controls (13) . Similarly, we found that eosinophils recruited to the airways after ovalbumin sensitization were associated with less parainfluenza 1 virus in the lungs of guinea pigs, although those experiments were not designed to establish a causal role for eosinophils (14) . Collectively, these studies suggest that eosinophils contribute to antiviral immunity in the lungs.",

TLR7 binds single-stranded RNA that is a common genomic motif for many respiratory viruses (16) . TLR7 ligation triggers myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) adaptor proteindependent signaling that promotes an eosinophil antiviral response (12) . However, the mediators responsible for eosinophils' antiviral activity are under debate. Eosinophils release a variety of granule proteins after activation that may be antiviral. Eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin are members of the RNase A superfamily, and are proposed to have a virucidal effect by degrading viral RNA genomes (13, 17, 18) . Eosinophil peroxidase is also released from eosinophil granules and contributes to the generation of antimicrobial reactive oxygen species (19) . Whether eosinophils target all viruses with these proteins or by unique mechanisms requires further study.",

Thus, elevated eosinophil numbers in the lung may passively disrupt airway infection by acting as a cellular decoy and/or \"sink,\" interfering with the progressive expansion of viral numbers during infection. Our data also show that eosinophils proactively mediated antiviral activities through the production of nitric oxide and up-regulation of TLR7.

Previous studies proposed that eosinophils inhibit RSV and pneumonia virus in mice, in part via the degradation of viral RNA genomes by eosinophils' granule RNases, eosinophil cationic protein, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (13, 17, 18) . However, we found that eosinophils did not alter the quantity of viral RNA transcripts for three key parainfluenza virus structural proteins (i.e., matrix, fusion, and nucleoprotein), despite causing a substantial reduction in parainfluenza infectivity, titered in RMK cells by hemadsorption assay. This suggests that eosinophils do not inhibit parainfluenza through RNase activity on the viral genome. Importantly, our methods differed from prior studies by quantifying both viral RNA and infectivity compared with only assessing viral infectivity after treating infected eosinophils with RNase inhibitors. Concurrent measurement of viral RNA levels and infectivity led to the additional finding that, although human eosinophils infected with parainfluenza produce viral RNA, these viral progeny are not infectious. This phenomenon, termed an \"abortive\" infection, has been described for many viruses, including RSV (28) and coronavirus (29) in macrophages, and influenza A in neutrophils (30) , as well as for parainfluenza virus in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells (31) and chick embryo fibroblasts (32) . Evidence suggests that specific virus and host cell characteristics impact productive versus abortive outcomes during virus infections (33), but those characteristics require further investigation.",

Previously, systemic suppression of nitric oxide production using an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase delayed clearance of RSV in wild-type mice and in IL-5 transgenic animals with systemic eosinophilia in vivo (12, 34) . Given the widespread expression of nitric oxide synthases, however, these studies were unable to distinguish the specific role of eosinophil-derived nitric oxide, which our study has elucidated. The ability of eosinophils to produce nitric oxide has been suspected for some time, given the presence of both constitutive and inducible nitric oxide synthase isoforms in eosinophils (35) , but detecting nitric oxide has historically been challenging due to its short half-life and rapid diffusion across biologic membranes (36) . These issues were overcome by using a copper-conjugated intracellularly retained fluorescent probe. We found that eosinophils generate nitric oxide in response to virus infection, and in response to stimulation with synthetic TLR7 agonist. IFNg potentiated TLR7-mediated nitric oxide production in eosinophils, likely in part through the up-regulation of TLR7 expression. Thus, our results show that antiviral cytokine signaling augments eosinophils' viral detection and their antiviral nitric oxide response. Nitric oxide mediates antiviral effects via the production of a variety of reactive nitrogen products that inhibit viral proteases (37) , and alter host cell function through nitrosylation of tyrosine and thiol groups (38) . The consequences of these nitrogen species are diverse, ranging from inhibition of virus protein and RNA synthesis to potentiation of inflammation and injury to the respiratory tract (39) . Nitric oxide also regulates many other physiologic processes, including eosinophil migration (40) and survival (41, 42) , airway epithelial cell ciliary motility (43) , and airway caliber through airway smooth muscle relaxation (44) . Eosinophil-derived nitric oxide may affect multiple functions in the airway beyond what our experiments were designed to assess.",

For example, eosinophil peroxidase has been shown to have virucidal effects against human immunodeficiency virus in vitro (46) . However, the role of eosinophil peroxidase in vivo as a host defense mechanism remains unclear. Eosinophil peroxidase deficiency had no effect in an experimental model of helminthic parasite infections in mice (47) , and its deficiency has also been detected in humans without manifesting an apparent phenotype (48) .

Although NJ.1726 IL-5 transgenic mice ( \u2191 Eos \u2191 IL-5) with an abundance of airway eosinophils had reduced parainfluenza virus in the lung, NJ.1726-PHIL mice (\u00d8Eos \u2191 IL-5) with elevated IL-5 in the absence of eosinophils did not. This is pertinent given the presence of IL-5 receptors on leukocytes other than eosinophils, including macrophages and neutrophils (49) , which could have contributed to the antiviral effect in vivo. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that, although an induced airway eosinophilia promoted viral clearance, clearance of virus was similar for eosinophil-deficient mice relative to wild-type control animals. This suggests that the presence of a specific airway eosinophilia mediates one or more unique antiviral mechanisms not occurring at homeostatic baseline, and underlines the need for better characterization of asthma phenotypes when evaluating respiratory virus infections in humans.",

Recent trials that studied exacerbation rates in well characterized steroid-resistant eosinophilic subjects with asthma treated with mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-5, found no difference in the incidence of respiratory tract infections (4, 5) . However, airway infections were rare events, and were diagnosed clinically without objective evidence of the presence of an infecting virus. Furthermore, these trials did not quantify airway and lung parenchymal eosinophils, nor did they characterize the eosinophils' activation state after treatment.

However, we cannot conclude that eosinophils' antiviral effects result in fewer exacerbations. On the contrary, it is possible, and perhaps likely, that eosinophils' ability to detect and respond to viruses promotes an exuberant, and ultimately detrimental, airway inflammatory response in subjects with asthma. Although our study did not specifically address airway physiology, Adamko and colleagues (14) found that eosinophils mediate virus-induced airway hyperreactivity in sensitized guinea pigs, and were associated with lower viral titers, yet lower viral titers did not improve airway hyperreactivity. Thus, the negative effects of activated eosinophils' in the airway may mask any positive impact from fewer viral transcripts. Consequently, as therapies become progressively more targeted against pulmonary eosinophils, there will be an even greater need for understanding the complexity of eosinophil biology in the lungs. n",
