Cardiac injury and arrhythmias were common, especially for ICU patients [1] [4] . Short-term prognosis of COVID-19 patients are discrepancy and in-hospital mortality risk are high in severe cases[1] [2] Although previous study had indicated that several risk factors were independently associated with short-term mortality, such as elevated d-dimer, older age and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [2] , few studies focused on cardiac injury with COVID-19 patients. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) was highly sensitive and specific markers of myocardial damage [5] and hs-cTnI elevation was not uncommon with COVID-19 patients[1] [2] . However, a recent report of autopsy for a COVID-19 patient found that there were a few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, but no other substantial damage in the heart tissue [6] . Until now, the relationship between cardiac injury and in-hosptial prognosis and the mechanism of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients remained controversial. Studies focused on cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients were scarce. In the present study, we sought to investigate the association between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19.",

Before 14 th February 2020, patients with confirm or suspected COVID-19 were transferred to designated hospital after initial treatment. A portion of suspected patients with COVID-19 at the early stage of the outbreak did not receive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR testing due to the limited supplies of diagnostic detection reagents. Patients who underwent hs-cTnI test within 48 hours after admission were included. Oral consents of all patients were obtained.

We used the Student's t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Fisher's exact test to compare differences between survivors and non-survivors where appropriate. To explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death, univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used. Considering the total number of deaths (n=17) in our study and to avoid overfitting in the model, five variables were chosen for multivariable analysis on the basis of previous findings, results of baseline characteristics comparison and clinical constraints. In a recent large cohort [2] , Older age and d-dimer elevation was related to in-hospital death. SpO2 decrease was more common with severe patients than general patients. Chronic kidney diseases and elevated serum creatinine was more common among non-survivors [2] . Cardiovascular disease, lymphocytopenia and C reactive protein were excluded because their between-group differences were not significant. Severe type was excluded due to collinearity with SpO2. Between-group differences of leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia were statistically significant but we did not included them duo to unclear clinical significant. Hence, age, SpO2, serum creatinine value, d-dimer value analyzed as continuous variates and hs-cTnI elevation analyzed as categorical variate were chosen ultimately for our multivariable Cox regression model. Kaplan-Meier curve with log-rank test was used to compared mortality between patients with or without myocardial injury (MI). A two-sided \u03b1 of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done using the SPSS software (version 19).",

Recent studies concerning the novel coronavirus provided evidence of the potential connection SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute cardiac injury [2, 4] . We observed that the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia were highly variable and overlap, whereas the most common symptoms were cough, fever and fatigue, with dizziness and diarrhea less common. While typical symptoms like fever could be absent in the disease progression particularly in elderly, adversely, gastrointestinal discomfort and altered mental status presented more frequently.

While confirmation of SARS-CoV-2-related myocarditis has been hampered by its heterogeneous clinical presentations and complexity of definitive diagnose, PCR technology have enabled detection of many other virus within the myocardium of affected patients [12] .
