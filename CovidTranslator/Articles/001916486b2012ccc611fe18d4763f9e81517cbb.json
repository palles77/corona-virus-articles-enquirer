Furthermore, use of cats in research in this country has declined dramatically during the past two decades from a high of 74,000 in 1974, amounting to a 65% reduction (Animal Care division of APHIS, USDA). If the importance of cats as a research species was judged entirely on these numbers, one might conclude incorrectly that cats do not contribute significantly to biomedical research. In fact, cats contribute uniquely to science, and their special biological characteristics and diseases rank them as the favored species for several disciplines, including experimental neurology, some aspects of ophthalmology, retrovirus research, inherited diseases, and immunodeficiency diseases.",

            "text": "The domestic cat (Felis cattus) is one of only a few mammals other than humans and mice for which extensive information has been generated on its genome. This unusual emphasis on feline genomics is driven partially by the substantial number of naturally occurring inherited diseases that are useful as models of their human counterpart and partially by the interest of the National Cancer Institute's Laboratory of Genomic Diversity in host factors that determine susceptibility to feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus. Scientists of this laboratory have made major contributions to characterization of the feline genome. At their website, <http://rex.nci.nih.gov/ research/basic/lgd/front_page.htm>, they provide primer sequence and other information on 711 loci in the cat genome, many of which are homologous to human anchor loci or coding gene sequences. They also provide a genetic map for the cat with comparisons with syntenic chromosomal locations in humans, which shows an extraordinarily homology between gene locations of these diverse species. For example, of the 9 loci that map to autosome D 1 of the cat, all are located on human chromosome 1 lp. With the development of powerful tools of molecular biology that permit careful dissection of genomes, there has been a explosive interest in human inherited diseases and their animal counterparts. There was an unrealistic expectation that knockout transgenic mice would provide all models needed to study specific gene mutations. The reality is that mice with induced malfunction of many genes have no apparent disease, have lethal disease, or have clinical diseases that do not mimic the corresponding human disease. This is in sharp contrast to many inherited diseases of cats, which are virtually identical to the analogous human disease with respect to clinical presentation, patterns of inheritance, histopathology, and biochemistry (see Table I ). These models continue to be exceedingly important in research on pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapeutic modalities.",

Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is an oncornavirus that causes lymphosarcoma, leukemia, and aplastic anemia in cats and is similar to leukemia viruses of mice (murine leukemia virus) and chickens (avian leukemia virus). The feline disease is considered to be an important model for several characteristics of retrovirally induced disease, particularly hematopoietic tumors such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma. Paradoxically, the virus also causes immunodeficiency and myelosuppression. After infection, cats are persistently viremic and virus is excreted, particularly through saliva and nasal secretions. A regressive, nonviremic form is also recognized. Serological tests are based on detection of the major viral core protein of FeLV (p27 gag) in serum or plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) . Strengths of this model include substantial information on FeLV, pathogenesis of the disease, responses of the immune system, availability of FeLV strains of known virulence, and the ease of inducing infection and disease in cats (Hoover and Mullins, 1991) .",

Animal models are critically important for research on this prevalent and important human disease. Of several Helicobacter species infecting animals, H. felis is one of the most interesting and useful because of its wide host range, its ability to induce many, if not all, of the lesions found in human Helicobacter disease, and its adaptability to experimental induction in mice and cats. Helicobacterfelis is a naturally occurring pathogen in cats that appears to be prevalent in some colonies, but its prevalence or significance as an agent of clinical diseases in the general cat population is not clear (Lee et al., 1988; Perkins et al., 1996) . Fox et al. (1993) have studied this organism and the disease that it induces in mice and cats. It is clear from their work that H. felis contributes importantly to Helicobacter research as experimental infections of both mice and cats. In fact, these investigators have demonstrated that H. felis infection can faithfully reproduce all of the lesions found in the human disease (except ulcers), particularly those associated with the chronic infection (Enno et al., 1995; Wang et al., 2000) . In addition to H. felis infection, cats appear also to be naturally infected with H. pylori, raising the possibility that domestic cats could serve as a reservoir for this human pathogen (Perkins et al., 1996) .",

Intensive quarantine and conditioning procedures may or may not minimize these problems or be economical. Addition of cats of this type into facilities with stable colonies of cats introduces an unacceptable risk because, even after long periods of quarantine, inapparent or latent diseases such as feline leukemia, feline immunodeficiency disease, and feline infectious peritonitis may be transmitted to healthy cats. When the risks of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases (including zoonoses), unknown reproductive status, and variable tractability of random-source cats are compared with those of cats derived from breeding colonies, use of purposebred cats clearly becomes a wise investment. An additional important consideration is public objection to use of cats in research after being surrendered to shelters. The sum of these important issues argues strongly against the use of randomsource cats. One exception is the discovery of an interesting inherited disease or other diseases in cats that come from less than optimal environments and must be maintained in the laboratory but that may present some risks due to unknown or poor health history. In such cases it is important to impose a prolonged (8 to 12 week) isolation and observation period and to adopt intensive procedures to identify diseases, eliminate parasites, and vaccinate in order to prevent pathogen transmission (see Table II ).",

Establish the colony with disease-free stock and close the colony to any additions that do not meet or exceed the health status of the original stock 2. Regardless of the presumed health status of new additions, they should be subjected to the following before entering a closed colony: a. Isolation for at least 4 weeks, and longer if disease problems are suspected b. Thorough physical examination, including laboratory testing for FeLV, FIV, endoparasites, and ectoparasites. Other health screening such as hematology and clinical chemistry tests can be informative. Serologies should be repeated before termination of the quarantine c. Continued surveillance for clinical signs of infectious diseases that may be incubating at time of arrival d. Administration of vaccines, vermifuges, and ectoparasiticides as indicated. Repeat parasite control measures as recommended by the manufacturer 3. Vaccinate kittens at 8, 12, and 15 weeks of age against feline viral rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, and panleukopenia (FVRCP). Perform physical examinations of kittens at this time. Perform annual formal physical examinations, and administer FVRCP booster vaccines to adults once every three years. Breeding queens should be immunized after delivering kittens or before rebreeding to avoid infection of kittens in utero with modified live virus vaccines. Only killed panleukopenia vaccines should be used, because they confer highly protective immunization and live products may result in cerebellar hypoplasia if inadvertently given to pregnant queens 4. Conduct annual hematology, biochemical profile, and urinalysis on cats over 5 years of age. Kidney function is of particular concern, especially for breeding males 5. Repeat random serological screening for FeLV and FIV of at least 10% of the population annually 6. Instruct personnel to perform and report daily observation of all cats for changes in appetite, behavior, activity, or body condition. Changes require professional examinations 7. Immediately isolate any suspected sick cat, and conduct intensive diagnostic procedures, including necropsy examination if indicated lowed. Careful analysis of cost and complexity should be undertaken to determine if this approach is justified. Thoughtful planning of facilities, operational procedures, and personnel assignments is essential for success. In this chapter we provide details on housing and reproduction that constitute basic information useful for establishing an institutional breeding program. When possible, breeders should be derived from minimaldisease stock, and a rigorous program of vaccination and health testing must be followed to assure continued good health. A knowledgeable and experienced professional should oversee the breeding colony operation and be responsible for training personnel. Animal care personnel must be given adequate time to interact with these cats, particularly young kittens, to assure proper socialization, which will lead to tractable cats that will be suitable for routine handling and experimental manipulations. Periodic assessment Of reproductive success, ability to meet the needs of research projects, and colony health status is useful in making corrective adjustments and assuring that the breeding colony effort is economical and serves its intended purpose.",

Substantial variance from these guidelines should be approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. Requirements of the Animal Welfare Act for space and density restrictions also should be consulted, because housing must comply with these regulations or exceptions sought for good cause (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1995). Domestic cats develop highly structured interactive social groups, and most cats do not thrive in isolation (Fig. 1 ). Therefore, individual housing should be avoided unless particular experimental objectives dictate the use of single-cage housing or if caging is needed for short periods to permit collection of specimens, to administer material individually, or to accomplish treatment and/or observation. If caged, cats should be allowed out of their cages daily to exercise. At a minimum, cats should be housed in compatible pairs ( Fig. 2) or, preferably, in small groups of the same sex or, if breeding, a few females with a tom.

Disease transmission in breeding colonies is particularly problematic because there is usually a large proportion of juveniles in the group that are susceptible to infection between the lapse of maternal immunity and induction of protection by vaccines. Facility design that encourages a high level of sanitation and operational policies that assure cleanliness are essential to minimize infectious disease transmission. Daily operations should include vacuuming and mopping floors, disposal of soiled litter, replacing soiled cardboard nesting boxes, and washing utensils for water and food as needed. Weekly procedures should include washing litter boxes and food/water utensils in 180~ water, scrubbing soiled areas, and replacing nesting boxes. At least monthly, the room should be vacated, washed with hot water plus detergent, followed by disinfection with 10% hypochlorite. The premises should be dried thoroughly before cats are returned. Cats can be housed in airline-type carriers for the few hours required for this operation and become acclimated to the procedure. Individual cages should be accorded the same level of sanitation and processed through a mechanical cage washer weekly, because soiling in these closely confined cages is unavoidable, and daily hand washing is usually inadequate to maintain sanitation. Food and water should be separated from litter as much as possible.",

In addition to age, factors that affect the onset of puberty include breed, time of year or photoperiod, social environment, health, physical condition, and nutritional status. With proper health maintenance, nutrition, and control of light cycles, adolescent queens begin to cycle after attaining a body weight of 2 kg or more. Group housing, especially the introduction of a tomcat or estral queen, provides social stimuli that hasten the onset of estrus (Michel, 1993) .",

In the Northern Hemisphere, the season begins in January or February after the winter solstice, as the days get longer, and lasts until fall. Anestrus persists from October through December until the next breeding season begins in January or February. Cats are extremely sensitive to photoperiod. In an environmentally controlled laboratory setting, 10 or more hours of light in a 24 hr period is required for reproductive cycling (Shille and Sojka, 1995) . Maintaining a 14 hr light photoperiod and the use of natural daylight spectrum fluorescent bulbs assures the maximum fertility period and estrous cycling (H. J. Baker, unpublished observations, 1999) . Estrous cycling typically occurs within 7-10 weeks of instituting such a light cycle (Dawson, 1941; Scott and Lloyd-Jacob, 1959) ; however, this period can be shortened if preceded by a nonstimulatory light cycle of 8 or fewer hours of light (Hurni, 1981) , or if a tomcat or queen in estrus is introduced at the time of increasing the duration of light (Michel, 1993) .",

Queens can bear 50-150 kittens in a breeding life of approximately 10 years if allowed to mate naturally. Like tomcats, queens are polygamous and rarely form long-term bonds with a mate, although they often display preferences for particular mates. If allowed, a female may accept a number of males, and therefore litters may have multiple sires. Adolescent queens (queens less than 1 year of age) and queens greater than 8 years of age tend to cycle irregularly and to have smaller litters, more abortions, more stillbirths, and more kittens with birth defects. Following a normal lactation and weaning, queens return to estrus in 2-8 weeks (average 4 weeks) (Feldman and Nelson, 1996) . Many queens, however, return to fertile cycling while nursing their kittens (L6fstedt, 1982) . If a queen aborts or if her litter is removed by 3 days postpartum, she will return to estrus in approximately 1 week. Queens may experience estrus during pregnancy. In fact, 10% of females experience estrus between the third and sixth weeks of pregnancy (Beaver, 1992) . Fertile cycles are rare in the pregnant queen, but the development of different-age fetuses as a result of separate matings in different estrous cycles, known as superfetation, can occur. Although it is possible for a female to be continuously pregnant, nursing, or both, this high intensity of breeding is not recommended, because queens need a period of rest to regain body condition before the next period of pregnancy and lactation. Providing a period of short days (8 hr of light or less) for 4-6 weeks each year ensures anestrus, and reproductive rest and may ultimately enhance reproductive performance.",

Queens typically vocalize; rub their faces against objects, other cats, or human companions; and act \"friendly.\" Rubbing usually progresses to rolling, and many queens will stretch and squirm in lateral recumbency, opening and closing their paws. Queens may assume a lordosis stance and tread with their hindlimbs, but upon introduction to a tom, they are not sexually receptive and may aggressively turn on the male, hissing and striking out with their claws. Proestrus lasts as little as 12 hours or up to 3 days. Signs may be overt or subtle. In fact, proestrus is not observed regularly in all queens. Many queens abruptly shift from anestrus behavior (no display of sexual behavior) to standing, receptive heat (estrus).",

            "text": "Estrus is the phase of sexual receptivity that lasts 4-7 days on average, with a range of 1-21 days. Coital contact does not shorten estrus. During this period, queens commonly vocalize and call to toms when approached. They crouch and posture in a lordosis stance, treading in place with their hindlimbs. In this position, the queen's ventral thorax and abdomen touch the floor, her perineum is elevated, and her tail is displaced laterally as she presents herself to her mate (Fig. 4) . This stance can usually be induced by stroking the queen's back or dorsal rump. Occasionally, queens in estrus may exhibit urine spraying and marking. Behavioral estrus is more readily detectable in grouphoused cats than in individually cage-housed cats. Silent heat may occur in \"shy\" or low-social-order queens. Behavioral signs of estrus are absent in these queens despite normal hormonal cyclicity. Decreasing housing density or housing groups of lowsocial-order queens separately from more dominant queens often results in normal displays of estrous behavior (B. Griffin and H. J. Baker, unpublished observations, 1999) . There are various means of suppressing estrus in the queen, but ovariohysterectomy is the preferred method of contraception because it is safe, effective, and not associated with deleterious side effects. Progesterone compounds and androgenic compounds can suppress estrus but are not recommended, because of the wide range of severe side effects associated with their use. Because cats are polyestrous and do not ovulate following every estrous period, an interestrous period or nonestrous interval commonly follows estrus. Interestrus is the interval of sexual inactivity between waves of follicular function in cycling queens. During this period, all breeding behaviors cease. Queens typically return to proestrus within 1-3 weeks, although this period is variable and may range from 3 days to 7 weeks. If ovulation occurs during estrus, diestrus follows. Corpora lutea form within 24-48 hr of ovulation and begin secreting progesterone. They remain functional for 30-50 days in the nonpregnant queen, at which time regression occurs. An interestrous interval follows such that diestral queens cease breeding behavior for 33-100 days before proestrus/estrus resumes. Because breeding displays cease in diestrus, this phase is behaviorally indistinguishable from anestrus or interestrus. Anestrus is the period of sexual rest that occurs between October and January in most free-roaming queens. Anestrus queens are sexually noninviting and nonreceptive. They may hiss or strike out at toms that make sexual advances.",

Numerous studies have demonstrated progesterone concentrations consistent with ovulation in nonbred queens (Lawler et al., 1993; Potter et al., 1991; B. Griffin, unpublished observations, 1999) . Luteal-phase diseases, including feline inflammatory uterine disease and pyometra, occur in individually housed or nonbred queens. Noncopulatory stimulation capable of inducing ovulation may include the stroke of a hand down the back, other physical stimulation, and visual, auditory, or olfactory cues from a nearby tomcat.

Serum progesterone concentrations do not significantly differ in pregnant and pseudopregnant cats and therefore are not useful for pregnancy diagnosis. Relaxin is the only pregnancy-specific hormone in cats. Plasma relaxin assays (Witness | Relaxin, Synbiotics Corp., San Diego, CA) may be used to diagnose pregnancy in dogs after days 22-24 of pregnancy and are expected to become available for use in cats. Relaxin is secreted by the placenta. Concentrations increase from days 20-30 post-mating and remain elevated throughout pregnancy. This hormone helps maintain pregnancy and results in relaxation of the connective tissue of the pelvis (Verstegen, 1998) . Abdominal palpation is the most common method for diagnosing pregnancy in the queen. Fetuses may be palpated first at 17 days (2.5 weeks) as discrete, firm, spherical nodules (2-2.5 cm in diameter). By day 25, fetuses are no longer discretely palpable. Instead, generalized uteromegaly is evident and remains palpable through parturition. Beyond the 45th day of gestation, fetal heads can be palpated. With experience, palpation is a very reliable method of pregnancy detection and serves as the most economical and practical method in a laboratory setting. Behavioral changes may aid in pregnancy diagnosis, but they typically remain subtle during the first 2 trimesters, when some queens become increasingly docile. By the third trimester, behavioral changes are usually obvious and include excessive grooming of the mammary glands and perineum and nesting behavior. Occasionally, queens become irritable or defensive during their last week of pregnancy. Physical changes become apparent beginning at 2.5-3 weeks of pregnancy. The queen's nipples become pinker, larger, and more erect. Abdominal distension becomes evident by the fourth week and obvious by the sixth week. Imaging methods used for pregnancy diagnosis include radiography and ultrasound. Calcification of the fetal skeletons may occur as early as day 38 of gestation but is not a reliable finding until day 43; therefore, to ensure diagnostic study, radiography should be performed after day 43 of gestation. Uteromegaly may be seen before this but cannot be distinguished from pyometra or other inflammatory uterine disease. Abdominal radiographs are most useful for evaluating litter size prepartum. Ultrasound is a quick, easy, accurate, safe, and reliable method of pregnancy detection in the cat. Ultrasonographic evidence of pregnancy may be seen as early as 11-14 days, and fetal heartbeats can be recognized at 3.5-4 weeks (Mattoon and Nyland, 1995) .",

Caloric intake increases by approximately onethird by mid-gestation. Stress should be avoided in the pregnant queen, and a quiet, warm, dark nesting area should be provided during the last trimester. Parturition usually occurs at night. Behavioral and physical changes accompany impending parturition (Beaver, 1992) . One week prior to parturition, queens seek out dark, dry areas suitable for a nest. An increase in selfgrooming and irritability may be noted. Two to 3 days prior to parturition, mammary glands enlarge, and milk may be expressed. Twelve to 24 hr prior to parturition, the queen often exhibits nesting behavior characterized by restlessness, digging at the floor, vocalization, posturing to defecate, and failure to eat. Most queens prefer seclusion at parturition. A decrease in body temperature usually precedes delivery by 12 hr, however, this is not a reliable indicator of labor in the queen. Most litters are delivered within 2 hr, with 15 to 30 min intervals between kittens, but intervals may range from seconds to hours. Occasionally, a delay of 12-48 hr may be noted between kittens. This is usually secondary to disturbances, which may result in delayed parturition and/or moving of the kittens by the queen. Alternatively, the queen may elect to rest during parturition. This should not be confused with dystocia, which is rare in the cat.",

            "text": "Reproductive failure in domestic cats is uncommon. When present, it is most commonly associated with disease and/or en-appropriate serological testing. Husbandry practices should be critically assessed. Are proper housing, nutrition, and exercise being provided? Are environmental or social stressors evident? For example, has there been a recent environment change, such as pairing a dominant queen with an inexperienced tom? Low-social-order queens may exhibit silent heat (Shille, 1979; Griffin, unpublished observations, 1999) . Some queens show aversion to certain toms and preferences for others (Voith, 1980) . Early embryonic death and fetal resorption may occur secondary to inherited or infectious diseases, including feline viral rhinotracheitis, feline leukemia virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, panleukopenia, toxoplasmosis, and a variety of bacterial infections. In addition, fetal defects may contribute to early embryonic death and fetal resorption. Abortion may go unrecognized, because the queen may consume fetal tissues before they are seen. Because female infertility may be due to embryonic death and resorption or unobserved abortion, early pregnancy diagnosis is needed to assess possible contribution of infertility of the tom to reproductive failure. If the male is suspected and physical examination and infectious disease screening are normal/negative, semen evaluation should be performed. Although some tomcats can be trained to ejaculate into an artificial vagina with the use of a teaser queen, most require general anesthesia and electroejaculation for semen collection. Postcoital vaginal cytology is the easiest and most practical method of semen evaluation. Accurate breeding records are essential to evaluate breeding performance. The following information should be recorded for each queen: parents, birth date, date estrus is observed, breeding dates (copulation if observed or exposure to male), identification of breeding tom, results of ultrasound examination (if performed), dates of delivery of each litter, litter size, numbers of male and female kittens, live births, number and cause of stillbirths or neonatal mortality (if known), number of kittens weaned, and date of recurrence of estrus. Periodic review of these records will reveal infertility problems, fecundity, lactation problems, and abnormal viability of kittens in utero and postnatally. Queens or toms with a history of recurring poor production should be eliminated from a breeding colony. Inbreeding is a common cause of reduced fecundity, birth defects, and infertility. Breeding records should indicate clearly whether inbreeding is likely to be the cause of reproductive failure, and outbreeding to unrelated cats from minimal-disease stock may solve this problem.",

Other complications include inflammation at the puncture site and secondary infection. Ear tags should be considered to be an interim measure until tattooing or microchip placement can be performed. Ear tagging requires sedation except in kittens less than 2 weeks of age. The most secure method is implantation of a microchip subcutaneously in the space between the shoulder blades.

Breeding queens should be fed a high-quality feline diet designed for reproduction or growth. Queens gain weight throughout parturition in a linear fashion, with their energy requirements increasing by 25-30% by mid-gestation (Buffington, 1991) . After parturition, energy requirements continue to rise to 3-4 times those of maintenance, as queens nurse their kittens (Lawler and Bebiak, 1986) . Peak lactation occurs 2-3 weeks postpartum. Maintaining adequate nutrition during this time is extremely important to ensure production of sufficient quantities of high-quality milk, particularly in queens with large litters. Exclusive use of canned foods during the third trimester of pregnancy and during lactation helps ensure adequate energy intake, because these products are more calorically dense than dry foods. After weaning, milk production and mammary congestion can be decreased by fasting queens for 24 hr before returning to maintenance feeding. As always, a continuous supply of fresh, clean drinking water must be available.",

Although the precise etiology or etiologies have yet to be defined, diet may be one contributing factor. Clinical signs associated with FLUTD include hematuria, dysuria, and pollakiuria. Cats may be observed entering the litter box frequently to strain, passing only small amounts of bloody urine each time. In males, urethral obstruction is a common sequela and, without rapid medical intervention, will result in death. The formation of magnesium ammonium phosphate crystals (struvite) is a complicating factor in FLUTD and can be controlled with dietary manipulation. Widely reported research in the 1970s concluded that dietary magnesium was the cause of FLUTD in cats, and low-magnesium diets were recommended to prevent recurrence of the disease (Buffington, 1991) . However, recent studies indicate that the most important factor in the development of struvite urolithiasis is urine acidity. Struvite crystals do not form in acid urine (pH --< 6.5). In the last decade, cat food manufacturers have included ingredients in their diets to maintain urine acidity, including \"digest,\" a product formed from the hydrolysis of animal tissues and by-products that contains phosphoric acid, which serves as a urinary acidifier. Digest is commonly sprayed on the outside of dry cat foods at 4-10% of the weight of the final finished product. It enhances the palatability of food as much as 2-to 3-fold. Chronic acidification of urine may result in a whole new set of problems for cats, including potassium depletion, renal dysfunction, and formation of calcium oxalate stones.",

Stress commonly reactivates latent viral respiratory infections, leading to increased virus shedding and even recurrence of clinical disease (Hawthorne et al., 1995) . Simply moving cats from one room to another can precipitate virus shedding. Overcrowding is one of the most potent stressors recognized in cats (Carlstead et al., 1993; Hoskins, 1994; Lawler, 1997) . Overcrowding increases both the number of susceptible animals and the number of asymptomatic carriers in a given group, while increasing the likelihood of disease transmission between group members through both direct contact and exposure to contaminated fomites. Other stressors include irregular schedules of feeding and cleaning, unpredictable daily manipulations, and infrequent or indifferent human contacts (Carlstead et aL, 1993) . Therefore, effective preventive health care starts with minimization of stress through regular daily activity patterns and environmental enrichment. Group housing of cats ensures social companionship. Installation of shelving allows cats to utilize both horizontal and vertical space, functionally reducing overcrowding by increasing the area available to each cat. Such structures also provide resting and hiding areas and allow cats to escape from aversive stimuli. The provision of toys and cardboard boxes ensures adequate opportunity for scratching and exercise and helps prevent circling, pacing, and other anxiety-related behaviors.",

In many cats, infections are self-limiting.",

Two types of coronaviruses infect cats: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). They are antigenically and morphologically indistinguishable. FECV is ubiquitous and avirulent. FIPV frequently coexists with FECV and is virulent. Most researchers believe that FIPV is a mutant of FECV. FECV is endemic in nearly all environments where a large number of cats share close quarters. It is associated with subclinical or self-limiting gastrointestinal signs, especially diarrhea. FECV infection commonly approaches 100%, but disease is almost always insignificant and no mortality results. FECV is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. After the virus is ingested, it binds to enterocytes, replicates, and kills the cell. If enough enterocytes are destroyed, a transient diarrhea ensues. Humeral immunity is stimulated as FECV is taken up by mesenteric lymph nodes. Local antibody production blocks further infection of enterocytes.",

The mutation that allows this to occur confers potent virulence because the virus is capable of replicating in macrophages that leave the mesenteric lymph nodes and migrate peripherally. FIPV is a systemic intracellular pathogen, but systemic antibodies are not protective. In fact, antibody production may actually enhance disease because complexes formed when antibodies bind with virus result in increased uptake of the virus by macrophages, where further replication occurs. Clinical FIPV disease is most common in young (< 18 months old) and old cats (> 13 years old). It may manifest as an acute vasculitis with pleural and/or peritoneal effusions or as a chronic pyogranulomatous disease. There is no effective treatment once clinical disease is present.",

It is readily destroyed by disinfectants. Litter has been cited as the most important fomite in transmission of this disease. The phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement makes vaccination controversial. However, an intranasal vaccine using a temperature-sensitive mutant is available. Early weaning and barrier raising may also be useful management practices to prevent infection of kittens. In addition, proper maintenance and husbandry, including vacuuming of litter particles and cleaning and frequent changing of litter boxes, are important to limit transmission of coronaviruses.",

The most common parasites include fleas, ear mites, cestodes, ascarids, hookworms, and coccidia. Fleas cause marked allergic dermatitis in many adults and serve as vectors for transmission of infectious diseases and tapeworms (Dipylidium caninum). Several very effective commercial products are available for flea control. Because both cats and kittens are extremely sensitive to toxic effects from insecticides, products should be selected carefully and used only on animals of the age for which they are intended. After eliminating fleas on adult cats, eradication can be achieved because sanitation eliminates opportunities for larval development. Ear mites (Otodectes cynotis) are the most common cause of otitis externa in the cat. They live in the external ear canal, feeding on tissue fluids and producing irritation. Their presence results in the formation of a thick, dark brown exudate consisting of cerumen and exfoliated debris. Infested cats shake their heads, scratch their ears, and often excoriate their pinnae. Untreated infestations may result in permanent damage to the ear. Diagnosis is made on close visual inspection of aural exudate where the mites are barely visible with the naked eye or by microscopic examination of exudate in mineral oil at x 10 magnification with a light microscope. If ear mites are diagnosed in a colony, all cats, whether infected or not, should be treated. Although not labeled for this use, ivermectin (200-300 Bg/kg SQ q2 weeks x 2 treatments) is safe, practical, inexpensive, and extremely effective.",

Transmammary transmission is the most common route of transmission for both roundworms and hookworms, although cats may become infested by ingesting contaminated soil. Larvae ingested by adult cats migrate to body tissues and persist for years. During pregnancy, these larvae are reactivated and travel to the mammary glands, where they are shed into the milk and ingested by nursing neonates. Infested kittens may develop diarrhea as early as 2-3 weeks of age. Hookworms cause blood loss and anemia. Female worms produce eggs that pass in the feces and may persist in the soil for years. Control is readily achieved through proper sanitation and routine deworming of kittens. Pyrantel pamoate (8-10 mg/kg PO q3 weeks x 3 treatments) is highly effective against both roundworms and hookworms and is cost-effective and easy to administer. Adult cats acquire immunity and rarely experience reinfestation. In humans, hookworms and ascarids are associated with cutaneous larval migrans and visceral larval migrans, respectively. Protozoal parasites (coccidia and, less commonly, giardia) may occur in conditions of poor sanitation, particularly in kittens. Parasitization of the small intestine may result in diarrhea. Although uncommon, giardiasis is potentially zoonotic. Eradication consists of treatment of all cats with giardiacidal drugs (metronidazole at 50 mg/kg PO daily for 5 days or fenbendazole at 50 mg/kg PO daily for 5 days) and proper sanitation.",

Although no potential human health risk should be underestimated, in fact there are only a few of these infections that should be of any concern for a minimal-disease, closed cat colony. Infections of concern include cat scratch disease, dermatophytosis, and toxoplasmosis. There is little that can be done about cat scratch disease except to avoid cat scratch and bite injuries and to be aware of the potential for this infection in a wound that does not respond to the usual treatment. Dermatophytosis can be diagnosed by culture of the organism. It can be a difficult disease to treat in large groups of cats, and if treatment is attempted, the risk of human exposure must be considered (Moriello, 1995; Moriello and DeBoer, 1995) . Toxoplasmosis is an obligate intracellular Disease Etiologicagent Transmission protozoan parasite that can be transmitted to cats and humans by ingestion of infected feces/soil or undercooked meat. Diagnosis is difficult, but the simple expedient of changing litter daily, using gloves when handling litter and litter pans, and washing hands will essentially eliminate risk. Rabies vaccination of cats should be considered because of legal obligations and interstate shipping regulations; otherwise there is little or no risk to cats maintained in a closed colony derived from diseasefree stock. Cat salivary and urine proteins are potent allergens, and many people experience severe allergic reactions when exposed to cats. Because of high-density housing in the laboratory, special precautions must be taken to exclude allergic personnel from working with cats and to reduce the potential for induction of allergy. Personnel with known allergy to cats should not work with them unless they take special precautions such as using face masks and gloves.",
