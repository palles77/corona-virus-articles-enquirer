Second, DOs create turbulence between 2 spaces, and disrupt the positive laminar flow of the OR, which might subsequently lead to faster spread of airborne bacteria and particles to the surgical field [1, 13, 17, 18] . Andersson et al [14] showed a positive correlation between traffic flow rates and air bacterial counts in orthopedic procedures. They also identified a direct correlation between the number of people present in the OR and bacterial counts. Quraishi et al [19] demonstrated a direct correlation between the activity level of OR personnel and bacterial fallout into the sterile field. Additionally, Lynch et al [20] showed an exponential relationship between the number of DOs and the number of personnel in the OR. In their series, an information request was the main reason for the majority of DOs.",

The highest percentage of DOs occurs during the preincision [18] or postincision periods [10] . The majority of the traffic constitutes the circulating nurses, followed by surgical implant representatives, and then the anesthesia and orthopedic staff [18, 20, 21] . The most frequently reported single reason for DOs is getting supplies, along with gathering and transferring information. Scrubbing in and out during the procedure, staff rotation for breaks, talking with colleagues in the corridor, and coordinating with nursing and anesthesia personnel were also reported as reasons for DOs [18, 21] . It is important to note that the rate of unjustified traffic was considerably high among different studies [8, 18] .",

Mears et al [23] identified that DOs in 77 of 191 TJAs overwhelmed the positive OR pressure, allowing airflow to reverse from the hallway into the OR. The loss of positive OR pressure was a transient phenomenon; however, the time needed for the recovery of pressurization was unknown. On the contrary, Weiser et al [4] reported that positive pressure was not defeated during any single DO; however, they found that contaminated outside air entered the OR if 2 doors were simultaneously opened. In their study, OR pressure recovery took approximately 15 seconds following a DO. They supported that OR contamination was more likely attributable to the effects of the personnel who enter the OR, rather than as a primary cause of DOs. Furthermore, Rezapoor et al [25] demonstrated that the laminar airflow was protective against the negative influences of the number of people, and partially of DOs. Smith et al [13] also showed that bacteria colony forming units cultured on plates placed in sterile basins in the OR during the operation were significantly negatively associated with any DOs, and the function of laminar air flow.",

In a cohort of 2864 operated patients, the infection rate was 1.52% when fewer than 9 and 6.27% when more than 17 different people entered the OR. Cross-sectional observational studies evaluated the effects of measures to control OR traffic and the number of personnel as a preventative strategy in reducing PJIs [1, 8, 18, 28] . Knobben et al [28] observed that systemic and behavioral measures in the OR, including limiting unnecessary activity and individuals in the OR, can lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of prolonged wound discharges and superficial PJIs, as well as a nonsignificant decrease in the deep PJIs. It was, however, difficult to determine the influence of each measure on the final results.",

However, very little is known on the risks of potentially increased surgical site infections (SSIs)/periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) when the surgeon performing the arthroplasty has an upper respiratory infection. On the other hand, Navalkele et al [33] demonstrated that SSIs were more likely to develop in patients who had respiratory tract infections within 30 days prior to surgery (20% vs 6.6%; odds ratio 3.42, 95% confidence interval 1.62-7.22, P \u00bc .0034).",

If the principal pathogens responsible for common cold, rhinitis, and influenza (rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus) are generally not responsible for SSIs, other microorganisms are commonly associated with a viral respiratory disease: Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Gram-negative bacteria, and methicillin-resistant S aureus (measuring 0.2-5 mm) can adhere to the condensation droplets to form colony forming units, and be infectious in short-range scenarios (less than 1 m), theoretically leading to SSIs.

A recent study by Markel et al [55] investigated the degree of airborne contaminates with different head covers (disposable skull caps, disposable bouffant hats, and cloth skull caps) in the OR during standardized mock surgical procedures. They measured the number of particulates being 0.5 and 1.0 mm in size, and found that there were significantly higher numbers of airborne particulates when disposable bouffant hats were used compared to cloth surgical caps (P < .05). There was no significant difference seen in airborne particulates after active sampling, when comparing bouffant hats with disposable surgical hats. However, for passive settle plate analysis, it was determined that bouffant style hats allowed for a significantly greater amount of microbial shedding at the sterile field, compared to disposable skull caps (P < .05). They further concluded that disposable bouffant hats had a higher permeability/porosity, and yielded higher levels of bacterial shedding in the OR. They endorsed the use of skull caps for reducing the potential risk of contamination from scalp hair. This, however, is against the recommendation of the Association of Peri-Operative Registered Nurses for OR personnel to wear bouffant caps. It should be considered that the outcome studied was contamination in vitro in comparison to actual surgical site infections (SSIs) seen in surgical patients [56] .",

They found the CFUs and bacterial shedding in the bearded group were no greater in comparison to the clean-shaven group when masked (1.6 vs 1.2 CFUs, P \u00bc .9), unmasked (9.5 vs 3.3 CFUs, P \u00bc .1), or in surgical hoods (0.9 vs 1.3 CFUs, P \u00bc .6). Additionally, they found that surgical hood use did not decrease the total number of bacteria isolated per subject, with a mean of 1.1 CFUs while hooded vs 1.4 CFUs with the mask alone (P \u00bc .5). Unmasked subjects shed a mean of 6.5 CFUs more than the number shed while masked (P \u00bc .02) or hooded (P \u00bc .01). The authors also found that when participants were stratified by beard length, those with beards 20 mm or longer shed more than clean-shaven subjects when unmasked (18 vs 3.3 CFUs, P \u00bc .03), but this difference was eliminated with the addition of a mask. The authors concluded that beards in an operative environment appear to add no definitive risks of bacterial shedding in comparison to those who do not have facial hair, when proper facial coverings are utilized.",

By introducing these precautionary measures, the SSI rates dropped from 5.9% to 3.0%, the MRSA infection rates from 1.2% to 0.3%, and the MRSA PJI rates from 9.7% to 1.0%. Mullen et al [89] implemented a decolonization protocol of colonized staff and patients and reported a decreased rate of SSIs from 1.76% to 0.33%. Despite reporting the highest staff colonization rates (31% of theater staff), Portigliatti Barbos et al [94] showed a reduction of the already low SSI rates of 0.6% to 0% after a 5-day decolonization course of intranasal mupirocin ointment for affected orthopedic surgical team members. Dilogo et al [91] did not identify any MRSA colonized orthopedic staff members, and concluded that there were no significant associations between MRSA staff colonization and infections. We did not identify a relevant study investigating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis within the context of the question.",
