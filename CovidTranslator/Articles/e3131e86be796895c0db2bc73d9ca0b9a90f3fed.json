Sera from 135 children (136 episodes of prolonged coughing lasting 1-6 weeks) were tested for antibodies to different viruses and bacteria. Swabs were taken for culture and PCR to detect different viral and bacterial pathogens. One or more pathogens were found in 91 (67%) patients. One infectious agent was found in 49 (36%) patients, two agents in 35 (26%) patients, and more than two agents in seven (5%) patients. The most frequent pathogens encountered were rhinovirus (n = 43; 32%), Bordetella pertussis (n = 23; 17%) and respiratory syncytial virus (n = 15; 11%). The most frequent mixed infection was B. pertussis and rhinovirus (n = 14; 10%). No significant differences in clinical symptoms were observed between patients with or without pathogens; however, patients with mixed infections were significantly older. There was a strong seasonal influence on the number of infections, but not on the number of mixed infections. In children with prolonged coughing, there was a high frequency of mixed infections regardless of the season. However, mixed infection was not associated with increased disease severity. No clinical symptoms were found that allowed discrimination between specific pathogens.",

            "text": "Prolonged coughing is a frequent symptom in children and is often associated with respiratory tract infection [1] . Although prolonged coughing is a prominent feature of infection with Bordetella pertussis, infections with other respiratory tract pathogens may also cause prolonged coughing [2] . Mixed infections with a combination of two or more pathogens occur, but data on clinical manifestations of combined infections derived from retrospective studies are often difficult to interpret [2] [3] [4] [5] ; nevertheless, it has been suggested that mixed infections may result in more severe illness, especially in younger children [3, 4, 6] . In an earlier retrospective observational study (unpublished data) involving 81 children with serologically proven B. pertussis infection, evidence was found in 28% of the children for concomitant infections with other respiratory tract pathogens. It is known that many such pathogens may cause prolonged coughing in children, but prolonged coughing is not always caused by a respiratory tract infection [1, 7, 8] . The present study investigated the role of different respiratory pathogens in prolonged coughing in children, as well as the frequency of occurrence of possible mixed infections. In addition, the severity of disease in patients with one or more pathogens was compared with that in patients for whom no pathogens were detected.",

Disease duration was defined as the time between onset of symptoms and first visit to the hospital. The definition of prolonged, chronic or persistent cough has varied from 5 days to > 1 month [2, 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] . Patient selection in the present study was based on a persistent cough lasting 1-6 weeks. Patients with aspiration of a foreign body or patients known to have cystic fibrosis were excluded. Blood samples were analysed at the first visit for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, leukocyte count and differentiation, and serological evidence of respiratory pathogens (see below). Oropharyngeal, nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken for culture and PCR analysis for respiratory pathogens (see below). When the disease duration on the first visit was < 14 days, serological tests were repeated after 2 weeks, except for B. pertussis. When serology and PCR results at the first visit were negative for B. pertussis, the serological testing was repeated 4 weeks later (after 6 weeks for children aged < 1 year). The patients, or their parents, were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding symptoms, previous diseases and vaccination status. All gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. A follow-up telephone interview was conducted c. 4 weeks after enrolment. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the hospital. A healthy control group was not included in this study.",

In one-point serology, a titre \u2021 128 was considered to indicate recent infection, while a titre \u2021 64 was considered to be equivocal, except for C. burnetii ( \u2021 4 equivocal) and Chlamydia ( \u2021 8 equivocal) [15] . An indirect IgM immunofluorescence assay (Serion Immunodiagnostica) was performed when the complement fixation method was equivocal. A positive IgM result, together with an equivocal complement fixation test result, was also considered to be proof of a recent infection. As there are serological cross-reactions between parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3, these results were reported together.",

The role of B. pertussis in rhinovirus infection is complicated; indeed it has been reported that rhinovirus-induced changes in airway smooth muscle responsiveness in isolated rabbit and human airway smooth muscle tissue, as well as cultured airway smooth muscle cells, were largely prevented by pretreating the tissues with pertussis toxin or with a monoclonal blocking antibody to intercellular adhesion molecule-1, the principal endogenous receptor for most rhinoviruses [45] . This might indicate that co-infection with rhinovirus and B. pertussis is not as severe as might be expected. This hypothesis was supported by the observation in the present study that coughing and other clinical symptoms did not differ significantly from those in patients infected with either rhinovirus or B. pertussis, and the fact that, although there was a co-infection incidence of 61% with B. pertussis and rhinovirus, there was less fever in the co-infected group, as would be expected with B. pertussis infection alone. In agreement with other studies [2, 9, 31, 44, 46] , no pathogens or positive serological results were obtained for 33% of the patients in the present study, although pathogens as yet unidentified may be associated with prolonged coughing in this group, as exemplified by the recent description of human metapneumovirus and human coronavirus NL63 [23, 47, 48] .",

However, the occurrence of pathogens in subjects without coughing would provide data on the incidence of carriage of potential pathogens without disease.

[31] isolated S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis more frequently from patients with long-standing cough than from healthy individuals of the same age. In a case-control study involving general practitioner patients of all ages with acute respiratory tract infections, significantly fewer viruses were detected in controls than in patients (19% vs. 54%) [36] .",

Since carriage rates for potential pathogenic bacteria in healthy young children may vary between 11% and 48% [31, 49] , it is difficult to establish whether these bacteria may have a clinical influence. In a logistic regression analysis, although not statistically significant, there was a greater association with coughing in the morning for pathogens diagnosed by PCR or serology than for pathogens diagnosed by oropharyngeal bacterial culture (OR, 2.0 vs. 0.8). Similar associations were found when coughing patterns at other times of the day were analysed. Therefore, it can be argued that a positive bacterial oropharyngeal culture is of little value in the search for respiratory pathogens causing prolonged cough.",

            "text": "More than one pathogen was detected in 31% of all children. The presence of one (viral) respiratory pathogen may predispose to a second or third (bacterial) infection [39, 42, 46] . The proportion of mixed infections reported in other studies shows large variations (10-74%) [9, 33, 34, 38, 39, 46] . There is a significant seasonal influence on disease, so the observation period of the present study was 2 years. In the second year, a low incidence of prolonged coughing was observed, with few [3] [4] [5] [6] 43, 44, 48] , but this was not the case in the present study (Table 1) . Generally, it seemed that there was one dominant pathogen, with no cumulative or synergic effect of a second pathogen. Patients with more than one pathogen were significantly older than those with one or no pathogens, which might indicate that they were more seriously ill than children of similar age with one or no detectable pathogen. This is supported by the fact that there was a slight tendency for coughing to be more frequent in patients with two or more pathogens (Table 4 ). In summary, one pathogen was detected in 36% of children with prolonged coughing, and more than one pathogen in 31%. There was a strong seasonal influence on the number of cases, but not on the pathogens found or on the percentage of multiple infections. Clinical data did not distinguish between pathogens, or whether or not pathogens were found. There was no increase in disease severity, with respect to symptoms and hospitalisation, for cases of mixed or consecutive infection, although this group was significantly older, suggesting that they had a more severe disease than their peer groups with one or no pathogens. Obviously, not all possible pathogens found will cause illness, although it is still not clear whether or how the presence of a colonising potential respiratory pathogen influences or facilitates infection caused by other possible pathogens. It is therefore important to extend studies on respiratory tract infections associated with more than one pathogen in order to evaluate their influence on disease severity.",
