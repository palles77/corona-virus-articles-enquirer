The authors investigated the efficacy and stress effects of carbon dioxide euthanasia in 24 ferrets that had participated in previous experimental protocols. They euthanized ferrets by placing them in cages that were either prefilled with carbon dioxide or gradually filled at a displacement rate of 10%, 20% or 50% of the cage volume per min. Blinded observers subjectively evaluated ferret distress. Prefilling the cage or filling it at a rate of 50% volume per min resulted in less time to recumbency and to last breath than did filling the cage at a slower displacement rate. Slower carbon dioxide displacement rates also caused an increase in ferret blood glucose concentrations, which may indicate distress. Overall, observers found that prefilling the euthanasia cage caused the least stress to ferrets.",

According to one estimate, ferrets probably make up less than 10% of the animals in this category 2 . Though less common than other laboratory animal species, ferrets have many uses in biomedical research. Some facilities use ferrets to teach pediatric endotracheal intubation techniques because the airway of the ferret resembles the human pediatric airway in size and anatomy 3 . Ferrets are also an important model for the study of human and avian influenza virus transmission [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] and for the development of vaccines against these viruses [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . They are especially useful for studying the synergism of influenza infection and bacterial colonization that occurs in pediatric patients 15 . Additionally, because ferrets are susceptible to infection by the coronavirus that led to the SARS outbreak in 2003 (ref. 16) , they may prove to be a useful model for this disease 17 . Ferrets are naturally colonized with Helicobacter mustelae and can present with gastric ulcers, thus providing a model for the attachment and colonization of human Helicobacter pylori 18 and its role in gastric ulcer formation. The ferret is also a model for human metabolism of carotenoids, which are natural plant pigments 19 .",

The report states that carbon dioxide is an acceptable method of euthanasia in mink, but indicates that the gas must be administered in high concentrations because mink are burrowing animals and have physiological mechanisms to cope with carbon dioxide exposure. One study showed that mink were able to survive for longer than 15 min when exposed to carbon dioxide at a concentration of 70% mixed with 30% atmospheric air 21 . Because ferrets are burrowing relatives of mink, ferret euthanasia may also require high concentrations of carbon dioxide.",

According to the AVMA report, prefilling may be an acceptable method of euthanasia, provided it does not cause distress. Distress resulting from prefilling has not been evaluated in ferrets, and it is not known how prefilling compares with gradual-fill methods for the euthanasia of this species. Additionally, for gradual-fill euthanasia, species-specific guidelines regarding carbon dioxide displacement rates and their effects on the ferret are needed.

In humans, within minutes of exposure to almost any physical or neurogenic stressor, the adrenal glands secrete cortisol in response to stimulation by the adrenocorticotropic hormone, often increasing its secretion as much as 20 times 24 . Cortisol then stimulates gluconeogenesis by the liver and decreases cellular use of glucose. The overall effect after a stressful event is a rise in both serum cortisol and blood glucose concentrations. In animals such as the cat, hyperglycemia is a well-documented, rapid, physiological response to stress 25, 26 . A previous study of wild ferrets measured glucose concentrations to compare the stress induced by capture using leg-hold traps with that using cage traps 27 .

The parent or other proxy rates the subjective measure by drawing a mark on a horizontal line that is 10 cm long.

The final purpose was to determine, with the help of blinded observers using a visual analog scale, which of the chosen displacement rates was subjectively the least distressful to the ferrets. We collected additional data on the ferrets' behavior during euthanasia to help understand the observers' ratings of distress for each of the displacement rates.

All ferrets received a physical examination by a veterinarian one day before euthanasia. We acquired 23 of the ferrets from Marshall BioResources (North Rose, NY). One ferret was born in our facility under an approved protocol. We group-housed ferrets in enclosures with a total volume of 53 ft 3 . We maintained them on a light:dark cycle of 12 h:12 h in a temperature-controlled room (64-84 \u00b0F). Throughout the study, ferrets had ad libitum access to food (Marshall Premium Ferret Diet, Marshall Pet Products, Wolcott, NY) and water. All ferrets were scheduled for euthanasia after conclusion of approved protocols in which they had participated. All procedures associated with this study were approved by the IACUC in a facility accredited by AAALAC, International. We arbitrarily divided ferrets into four groups. For one group, we prefilled the euthanasia cage with carbon dioxide, which was delivered at a rate of 8.5 l (50% of the cage volume) per min for 3 min. We then placed the ferret in the prefilled cage. In the other three groups, we first placed the ferret in the euthanasia cage and then introduced carbon dioxide at the rate of 1.7, 3.5 or 8.5 l per min as indicated on the flowmeter to approximate a displacement rate of 10%, 20% or 50% of the cage volume per min, respectively. We chose displacement rates of 20% and 50% volume per min based on the AVMA panel's global recommendation that at least 20% of the euthanasia chamber volume be displaced per minute. We euthanized one group in a prefilled cage because burrowing animals such as the ferret may require a higher concentration of carbon dioxide for euthanasia achievable by prefilling. We also included a displacement rate of 10% volume per min as we hypothesized that the slower rate might provide a slower, gentler death.",

Ferrets were able to survive for long periods of time when carbon dioxide was slowly introduced into the cage.

Ferrets seemed conscious and aware of their surroundings and began breathing deeply or gasping for breath as they became recumbent. Neither the 10% nor the 20% displacement rate was ever categorized by observers as \"good euthanasia.\" In contrast, the prefilled cage was seen as \"good euthanasia\" for five of the six ferrets euthanized using this method, and observers categorized the technique as \"appropriate\" 100% of the time. Though ferrets exhibited similar behaviors in all groups, the longer time to lateral recumbency caused the observers to determine that slower filling caused greater distress to the ferrets. Consistent with these observations, the rise in blood glucose in ferrets euthanized with slower fill rates is suggestive of a physiological response to a greater degree of neurogenic or physical stress.",

Though blood glucose samples were within reference ranges, slower filling of the euthanasia cage resulted in a statistically significant increase in blood glucose. Investigators should be aware that carbon dioxide displacement rate must be consistent between animals in order to prevent confounding results. Future studies should determine whether additional serum chemistry changes occur at various carbon dioxide displacement rates. They should also include additional objective measures to assess distress, such as cortisol, heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure, and should expand the study population to include males and ferrets of different ages. One purpose of this study was to determine which of the tested carbon dioxide displacement rates provided the least distressful euthanasia. But we would point out that there are alternative euthanasia methods that limit any distress experienced by the ferret. Panting, gasping, piloerection, vocalization, swelling of the jugular region, tremors and salivation occurred even when ferrets were euthanized in a prefilled cage. Euthanasia methods should seek to limit these behaviors as they may be signs of fear and distress in the ferret. Based on our facility's current practices, general anesthesia followed by intravenous or intracardiac injection of barbiturates should be encouraged as the preferred method of euthanasia in the ferret. In facilities that use carbon dioxide, administration of a sedative or anesthetic before introduction to the prefilled cage may also limit the behaviors we observed in this study.",
