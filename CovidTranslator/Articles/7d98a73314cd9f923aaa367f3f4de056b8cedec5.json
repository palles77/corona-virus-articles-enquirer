            "text": "Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are highly expressed during the cell-intrinsic immune response to viral infection. IFIT1 inhibits translation by binding directly to the 5' end of foreign RNAs, particularly those with non-self cap structures, precluding the recruitment of the cap-binding eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F and subsequent 40S recruitment. Interaction of different IFIT family members is well described, but little is known of the molecular basis of IFIT association or its impact on function. Here, we reconstituted different complexes of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 in vitro, which enabled us to reveal critical aspects of IFIT complex assembly. IFIT1 interacts rapidly and strongly with IFIT3 forming a stable heterotetramer. IFIT2 and IFIT3 homodimers dissociate to form a more stable heterodimer that associates with IFIT1, forming an IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 trimer. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed a C-terminal 'YxxxL' motif in IFIT1 that mediates its association with IFIT3. Using various reporter mRNAs, we demonstrate for the first time that IFIT3 stabilises IFIT1 binding to cap0-mRNA and enhances its translation inhibition activity. Disrupting the binding interface between IFIT1 and IFIT3 abrogated this enhancement. This work reveals molecular aspects of IFIT assembly and provides an important 'missing link' between IFIT interaction and function.",

Following infection, pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) sense non-self, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) triggering signalling pathways that activate an immune response (reviewed in 1). Detection of viral signatures by PRRs, such as RIG I-like receptor sensing of double stranded RNA, induces production of Type I and Type III interferon (IFN). Through binding of cell surface IFN receptors and subsequent activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, IFN activates the transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (2), many with known antiviral properties, priming neighbouring cells to restrict viral spread.",

In contrast, the promoter of the poorly characterised human IFIT1B lacks ISREs. Different species have varying complements of IFITs, but most mammals possess IFIT1, IFIT1B, IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT5 (5) . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that rodents, including mice, have lost IFIT1 and instead Ifit1b1 is IFN responsive (6) . In mice Ifit1b1 has undergone duplication twice (Ifit1b2 and Ifit1b3) and Ifit3 once (Ifit3b) (6) .

The crystal structures of IFIT1 and IFIT5 revealed a positively charged pocket formed in the groove between the N and C domains that interacts with single-stranded RNA (8) (9) (10) . IFIT1 RNA binding activity was first reported by Pichlmair et al. (12) who identified proteins in lysates from IFN stimulated cells that interacted with 5\u00b4-ppp RNAs. Subsequently, we and others demonstrated that IFIT1 tightly binds capped RNAs lacking methylation on the first cap-proximal nucleotide (cap0) with low nanomolar affinity (13) (14) (15) . While similar positively charged tunnels in IFIT1 and IFIT5 interact with the phosphate backbone of bound RNAs (8, 9, 13) , only IFIT1 possesses a large hydrophobic cavity at the rear of the tunnel that can accommodate the cap structure (9) . These findings support a model whereby IFIT1 out-competes eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E/4F for binding to cap0-mRNAs, thereby inhibiting their translation. As host mRNAs are generally methylated on the first or first and second bases (cap1 and cap2, respectively), this selectivity offers a mechanism of recognising and blocking translation of non-self RNAs.",

Interestingly, enzymatically 2\u00b4-O-methylated, capped mRNAs from parainfluenza virus 5 display differential translational sensitivity to IFIT1 in vitro, while wild type middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) replication was enhanced upon IFIT1 depletion suggesting that factors other than 5\u00b4 end methylation can influence IFIT1 recognition (22, 23) . By contrast, alphaviruses, such as the emerging human pathogen chikungunya virus, also rely on cap-dependent translation but lack a virally encoded 2\u00b4-O-methyltranferase, thus possessing viral mRNAs with a cap0 structure at the 5\u00b4 end (24) . Recent evidence suggests that stable secondary structure at the 5\u00b4 end of alphaviral genomes protects the viral RNAs from IFIT1 restriction (25, 26) . IFIT1 may also affect translation through interaction with eIF3 (27) , while its direct binding to the viral E1 protein restricts human papilloma virus replication (28) .",

(29) demonstrated that IFIT2 could interact both with itself and with IFIT1 and IFIT3 in HeLa cells. In the same study, an IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 containing complex in HeLa cytoplasmic lysates was also reported to migrate between 150-200 kDa when analysed by glycerol gradient sedimentation. Deletion analysis identified the first four TPRs of IFIT2 as being important for interaction with IFIT3 while the TPR(s) of IFIT2 that promote interaction with IFIT1 could not be elucidated (29) . IFIT1 was later reported to interact with IFIT2 or IFIT3 by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (12) . The crystal structure of IFIT2 revealed it forms a stable, domain-swapped dimer, with TPRs of the N-terminal domain exchanged between each monomer (7) . Using native gel electrophoresis, we previously demonstrated IFIT1 and IFIT3 could homooligomerise (13) , while a recently-reported crystal structure of IFIT1 identified a motif in the C terminus responsible for IFIT1 dimerisation (BioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/152850).",

To address this, here we have reconstituted different IFIT complexes from individually purified proteins, determined the oligomeric state of each and reveal for the first time that interaction with IFIT3 or a heterocomplex of IFIT2 and IFIT3 enhances the cap0 RNA binding and translation inhibition activity of IFIT1. We also demonstrate in vitro that although IFIT2 and IFIT3 individually form stable homodimers, the IFIT2:IFIT3 dimer complex is the energetically more stable species. Our results provide a critical missing link between IFIT oligomerisation and function, and present a mechanistic framework for understanding the role of IFITs in the host immune response.",

To this end, His-tagged IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 were individually expressed in bacteria and purified as described in Materials and Methods. The His-tag was removed from IFIT2 and IFIT3 but retained on IFIT1 for later detection. Each protein was subjected to size exclusion chromatography with multi angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) to analyse IFIT assembly. SEC-MALS reveals the molecular mass of species eluting at different volumes from a size exclusion column providing information about the oligomeric state of these species. Varying concentrations of IFIT were analysed by SEC-MALS and, consistent with a recent report (BioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/152850), IFIT1 oligomerised in a concentration dependent manner ( Figure  S2A ). In contrast, IFIT2 eluted as two species corresponding to a stable dimer or tetramer ( Figure  S2B) . Surprisingly, the IFIT2 dimer had a similar elution volume to the lowest concentration of IFIT examined. This demonstrates the importance of using the SEC-MALS technique which directly determines the mass of particles in solution from their Rayleigh scattering, instead of relying on the elution volumes of molecular weight standards during SEC to infer oligomeric state. When analysed alone, IFIT3 also eluted as a mostly dimeric species, with a smaller peak corresponding to a monomer ( Figure S2C ). We next examined the oligomeric status of complexes containing mixtures of the individually purified IFIT proteins. When incubated at 4 \uf0b0C for 1 hour IFIT1 and IFIT3 formed a stable complex that eluted with a molecular mass of 221 kDa ( Figure 2A, peak a) . Analysis of the protein in peak a by SDS-PAGE (gel inset) shows that IFIT1 and IFIT3 are equimolar, indicating that this complex represents stable IFIT1:IFIT3 tetramers. A later eluting species likely corresponding to IFIT1:IFIT3 dimers (123 kDa) is also evident (Figure 2A , peak b). IFIT1 and IFIT2 were incubated at 30 \uf0b0C for 1 hour and analysed by SEC-MALS. The IFIT1:IFIT2 complex was less defined and eluted as multiple species ranging from 148 to >234 kDa as measured by SEC-MALS ( Figure S2D ). While the most abundant IFIT1:IFIT2 complex form is likely tetrameric, the presence of several overlapping peaks precludes reliable determination of specific molecular mass and hence oligomeric state.",

Using this approach, protein unfolding is monitored by measuring the signal from a dye that fluoresces in hydrophobic environments, at increasing temperature. More stable proteins unfold at higher temperatures than less stable proteins. Unfolding exposes hydrophobic regions of the protein making them more accessible to the dye. Figure 2D shows the thermal melt curves for IFIT2 and IFIT3 homodimers and the IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer. The protein used in this assay is shown in the gel inset below the graph. IFIT2 and IFIT3 exhibit a monophasic melt curve from with Tm's of 37.3 \uf0b0C and 34.1 \uf0b0C, respectively, were calculated as described in the Material and Methods. This indicates that the IFIT2 is more thermodynamically stable than IFIT3. In contrast, the IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer exhibits a biphasic melt curve from which a reliable T m could not be calculated. However, as is evident from comparison with the IFIT2 and IFIT3 melt curves that the melting temperature of the IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer, and thus the stability, is greater than that of either the homodimers alone.",

Most of the IFIT1 was incorporated into a larger complex that eluted with a molecular mass of 165 kDa corresponding to a trimer ( Figure 2E ). Analysis of this complex by SDS-PAGE (gel inset) reveals that it contains equimolar amounts of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3. The remainder of the IFIT1 complexed with free IFIT3, a minor contaminant of the purified IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer, and eluted slightly earlier as a hetero-tetrameric complex with a molecular mass of 218 kDa. Finally, we incubated the IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer with a two-fold molar excess of IFIT1 at 30 \uf0b0C for 1 hour.

SDS-PAGE analysis of this complex (gel inset) reveals a molar excess of IFIT1 over IFIT2 and IFIT3 indicating that the heterotetrameric complex consists of two IFIT1 molecules to one molecule each of IFIT2 and 3 (compare gel insets in Figures 2 E and F) . The IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 heterotetramer was less stable than the trimer, precipitating when incubated at 4 \uf0b0C. Subsequently, only the IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 heterotrimer was used for further experiments.",

In vitro transcribed mRNAs comprising a firefly luciferase (Fluc) reporter flanked by either the human \uf062globin or zika virus (ZV) 5\uf0a2 and 3\uf0a2 untranslated regions (UTRs) were post-transcriptionally capped as described in the Materials and Methods. The \uf062-globin and ZV constructs represent mRNAs with weak or strong secondary structures in the 5\uf0a2 UTR, respectively. Schematics of the two constructs are shown in Figure 3A . These mRNAs were incubated with different IFIT heterocomplexes before addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). Translation was quantified by measuring the luminescence from the Fluc reporter. The amount of IFIT1 added was equalised by western blotting against the His-tag on the purified IFIT1 in each complex. The upper panel of Figure 3B shows an SDS-PAGE analysis of the protein complexes used in these experiments while the lower panel shows an anti-His-tag western blot of the same complexes. The linearity of the western blot signal to protein concentration was confirmed as shown in Figure S3 .",

Using our purified complexes, we next examined if the interaction of IFIT1 with cap0 mRNA was altered when part of a larger IFIT1:IFIT3 or IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 complex. We used a primer extension inhibition assay to monitor the IFIT1/cap0 mRNA interaction as previously described (13) . An advantage of this technique over other methods to analyse protein-RNA interactions, such as electrophoretic mobility shift assays, is that the primer extension reaction is performed in equilibrium binding conditions. IFIT1 alone or as part of an IFIT heterocomplex was incubated with the in vitro transcribed and capped model \uf062-globin and ZV mRNAs prior to the addition of a radiolabelled primer that binds within the Fluc mRNA sequence. A reverse transcription reaction is performed in which a full-length cDNA is produced in the absence of IFIT1, whereas a 7 nucleotide truncated cDNA, corresponding to the length of the IFIT1 RNA-binding surface, is produced in the presence of IFIT1 (13) . The cDNA products are subsequently separated by denaturing PAGE and detected by autoradiography. IFIT protein complexes shown in Figure 3B were used in the binding reactions. Representative autoradiographs are shown in Figure 4A . Quantification of the cDNA products was performed as described in the Materials and Methods and the binding curves shown in Figure 4B and C show the fraction of RNA bound at varying IFIT concentrations.",

Complexing with IFIT3 or the IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer reduces the K1/2,app of IFIT1 on this mRNA to 19 \uf0b1 0.8 nM (h = 2.5 \uf0b1 0.2) and 19 \uf0b1 0.7 nM (h = 1.98 \uf0b1 0.1), respectively. IFIT1 heterocomplexes also has the effect of saturating the binding on the mRNA as evident in the autoradiograms. This effect was even more pronounced when the cap0-ZV reporter was analysed. On this more structured RNA the K1/2,app of IFIT1 binding was 69 \uf0b1 1.8 nM (h = 3.5 \uf0b1 0.3) and only reached 60% saturation. In contrast, when complexed with IFIT3 or the IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer IFIT1 bound the ZV reporter with a K1/2,app of 29 \uf0b1 1.1 nM (h = 4.1 \uf0b1 0.6) and 58 \uf0b1 2.3 nM (h = 3.1 \uf0b1 0.32), respectively.

We next sought to identify how IFIT1 and IFIT3 interact. Murine Ifit3, which does not precipitate with murine Ifit1b1 (14) , has a large deletion at the C terminus ( Figure  S5 ) when compared to human IFIT3. As a result of this deletion, mouse Ifit3 lacks a 'YxxxL' structural motif present in both human IFIT3 and IFIT1 ( Figure 5A and B) recently reported to promote IFIT1 concentration dependent dimerisation (BioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/152850). Our SEC-MALS analysis demonstrates that the IFIT1:IFIT3 interaction is more stable than the IFIT1:IFIT1 interaction (compare Figure 2A and Figure S2A ).

However, the L464E substitution only had a modest effect on the interaction of IFIT1 with IFIT3 ( Figure 5D) . While a small portion of IFIT1-L464E eluted as a monomer, a stable tetramer with IFIT3 was the predominant species, like the wild type IFIT1 shown in Figure 2A . The Y460E substitution destabilises IFIT1:IFIT3 oligomerisation to a greater extent than the L464E substitution, with less IFIT1-Y460E sequestered to the IFIT1:IFIT3 complex ( Figure 5E ) but, as is clear in the SDS-PAGE analysis of this experiment (gel inset), IFIT1-Y460E can still associate with IFIT3. We therefore generated a Y460E/L464E double mutant of IFIT1 (IFIT1-YL). IFIT1-YL eluted as a monomeric species on SEC, similarly to the Y460E and L464E single mutants ( Figure 5C ).

In contrast to previous studies (12, 14) we used nuclease treated samples confirming that this interaction occurs in cells in an RNA-independent manner. Moreover, we confirmed that IFIT1 could interact directly with IFIT2 or IFIT3 by SEC. We then employed SEC-MALS to examine IFIT heterocomplex assembly for the first time. Unlike standard SEC, when coupled with protein gel analysis SEC-MALS enables reliable identification of oligomeric status. Figure 6 shows schematic representations of each of the IFIT complexes reconstituted in vitro in this study. Consistent with previous reports ((11) and BioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/152850), IFIT1 was found to reversibly dimerise in a concentration dependent manner ( Figure S2A ). While both IFIT2 and IFIT3 individually form stable homodimers as previously reported (13, 7) , an unexpected tetrameric form of IFIT2 was also detected ( Figure S2B and C) . Surprisingly, we found that the IFIT1:IFIT3 interaction is more stable than the IFIT1:IFIT1 complex (compare Figures 2A and S2A) . When analysed by SEC-MALS the predominant IFIT1:IFIT3 oligomeric state was a stable tetramer containing equimolar amounts of both proteins. The IFIT2 dimer eluted from the SEC at a volume expected for a monomeric species ( Figure S2B ) and as such had a similar elution volume as IFIT1. Very weak interaction of IFIT1 and IFIT2 was detected by SEC when these proteins were incubated at 4 \uf0b0C (RF and TS unpublished data). author/funder. All rights reserved.

The delayed elution of the dimeric IFIT2 from the size exclusion column fortuitously enabled us to analyse the IFIT2:IFIT3 interaction by SEC-MALS. Although no interaction between these two proteins was detected when incubated at 4 \uf0b0C, we observed the appearance of a heterodimeric complex when these proteins were incubated at 37 \uf0b0C ( Figure 2B ) indicating that addition of energy was required for this heterocomplex to form. The crystal structure of IFIT2 revealed that dimerisation of the protein was due to a domain swap of three \uf061-helices that constitute one and a half TPRs in the N-terminal domain (7) (Figure S6A and shown schematically in Figure 6 ). Nucleic acid binding activity of IFIT2 was localised to the dimer interface surfaces of the C-terminal domain that form a large positively charged pocket ( Figure S6B ). The electrostatic surface potential of an IFIT3 molecular model, based on the IFIT2 crystal structure, is shown in Figure S6C .

It is therefore possible that IFIT3 could interact with IFIT2 in a similar domain swapped manner (modelled schematically in Figure 6 , top right), consistent with TPRs 1-4 in the N terminus of IFIT2 being sufficient for the interaction as reported previously (29) . Results of SEC analysis and differential scanning fluorimetry experiments indicate that the IFIT2:IFIT3 complex is more stable than separate IFIT2 and IFT3 homodimers ( Figure 2C and D) . The reason for this is currently unclear but comparison of the thermal melt curves of the three complexes shows that unlike the IFIT2 and IFIT3 homodimers, unfolding of the IFIT2:IFIT3 complex is biphasic ( Figure  2D) . A possible explanation for this is that the IFIT2 and IFIT3 proteins unfold uniformly, whereas the interacting regions of the IFIT2:IFIT3 heterocomplex are stabilised and unfold at different rates to the rest of the protein domains in the complex. The IFIT2:IFIT3 complex does not display unfolding kinetics averaged between those observed for IFIT2 and IFIT3 suggesting that the heterocomplex is indeed more stable than each of its constituent parts alone. High-resolution structures of the IFIT2:IFIT3 complex are required to confirm how these proteins interact and are a focus of our ongoing investigation.",

Moreover, depletion of IFIT3 induced cell death in the U549 human carcinoma cell line, an effect potentiated by co-infection with Dengue virus (40) . Our data would suggest that the homodimeric form of IFIT2 may be responsible for this phenotype, and that co-expression of IFIT3 may mitigate this effect by disrupting IFIT2 dimerisation.

Unlike the IFIT1:IFIT3 tetramer, the IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 tetramer was unstable and precipitated during incubation at 4 \uf0b0C. In contrast, the heterotrimer was stable and enabled us to investigate the impact of IFIT2:IFIT3 complexing on the translation inhibition activity of IFIT1 (discussed below). A recent report described the crystal structure of wild type IFIT1 and revealed a dimerisation interface between Cterminal TPRs (BioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/152850), responsible for the concentration dependent homo dimerisation of the protein, confirmed here. Importantly, mutation of this interface had no impact on the translation inhibition activity of IFIT1 (BioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/152850 and Figure 5E ). We observed that IFIT3 shares multiple key residues involved in the IFIT1 'YxxxL' dimerisation motif, also in a C-terminal TPR. We therefore hypothesized that this motif is the site of interaction between IFIT1 and IFIT3. Mutational analysis of IFIT1 confirmed that this motif is indeed required for interaction with IFIT3 ( Figure 5 ). The double-mutant IFIT1-Y460E/L464E did not interact with IFIT3 when analysed by SEC. Since the wild type IFIT1 homodimer is less stable than the IFIT1:IFIT3 complex, as shown by our SEC-MALS analysis, we propose that the functionally-important role of the 'YxxxL' motif in humans is mediating interaction between IFIT1 and IFIT3 (shown schematically in Figure 6 ). Importantly, the crystal structure of IFIT5 reveals that, although critical interacting residues may be conserved, they are buried in an interface with a terminal helix not present in IFIT1 (8) (9) (10) , explaining why IFIT5 does not interact with IFIT3 ((12) and Figure 1 ). While the 'YxxxL' motif is conserved in mouse Ifit1b1, Ifit3 is truncated such that the 'YxxxL' motif is absent. In mice and other rodents, the Ifit1b1 gene has been duplicated (6) and it is possible that these extra IFITs could compensate for the disrupted murine Ifit1b1-Ifit3 interaction. This suggests species differences in the role of this motif, and in IFIT oligomerisation in general, that must be considered when examining phenotypes of small animal models used to examine the impact of IFIT depletion.",

We opted to use an RRL based translation inhibition assay system as this was previously used to demonstrate differential inhibitory effects of IFIT1 on mRNAs from parainfluenza virus 5 (22) . We used two reporters, one with a well characterised (41), highly structured 5\uf0a2 UTR (ZV, dG=-33.4 kcal/mol) and one with very little structure (\uf062-globin, dG=-10.5 kcal/mol), upstream of a Fluc reporter and with the corresponding 3\uf0a2 UTRs. IFIT1 strongly inhibited translation of both reporters ( Figure 3 ), but had a stronger effect on the less-structured \uf062-globin reporter, consistent with an emerging consensus that both the methylation state and RNA structure at the 5\uf0a2 end of an mRNA can influence its susceptibility to IFIT1 inhibition (9, 22, 23) . IFIT2 had no detectable impact on the ability of IFIT1 to inhibit translation in the RRL system ( Figure 3C ). In contrast, IFIT3 and to a lesser extent the IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer enhanced the translation inhibition effect of IFIT1 on both reporters ( Figure  3C -F).",

This has the potential to expand the repertoire of RNAs IFIT1 can interact with by providing additional stabilising interactions. Moreover, it is unclear why inclusion of IFIT3 alone has a stronger effect on translation inhibition than inclusion of the IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer. Since inclusion of IFIT2 alone had no impact on the translation inhibition activity of IFIT1 it is possible that the stimulatory effect is a result of the IFIT3 in the IFIT2:IFIT3 complex. The physiological role for this stimulation of binding is not immediately clear as we have previously demonstrated that IFIT1 binding to cap0-mRNA is sufficient to prevent association of the cap-binding translation initiation factor, eIF4F, in vitro (13) . However, a requirement for co-expression of other IFITs for the full anti-viral activity of IFIT1 has been reported (12) .

            "text": "While multiple cellular factors such as competing cap-binding proteins complicate analysis in cells, our in vitro mRNA binding assays reveal a clear cap0-mRNA binding advantage conferred by IFIT1 heterooligomerisation. When examined in our reverse transcriptase inhibition assays apparent IFIT1 binding was much less efficient for the structured cap0-ZV reporter than for the less structured \uf062globin mRNA, and in fact on the ZV construct failed to reach saturation (Figure 4 ). This is not due to incomplete capping of the mRNA as saturation is possible when IFIT3 is present. Instead, it is more likely that the reverse transcriptase may remove a proportion of the bound IFIT1 as it proceeds in a 5\uf0a2 to 3\uf0a2 direction resulting in the production of a full-length signal even if IFIT1 was initially bound. We conclude therefore that IFIT3, and the IFIT2:IFIT3 heterodimer, stabilise the interaction of IFIT1 with the cap0 mRNA in such a way that it is no longer removed by the reverse transcriptase. Interestingly, there was no evidence of a shift in the IFIT dependent toeprint to indicate that the other IFITs in the complex were interacting with the mRNA downstream of the IFIT1 cap0 binding cleft. IFIT5 changes conformation when transitioning between the apo-and RNA-bound state (8), positioning key residues for optimal RNA binding. The crystal structures of IFIT1 bound to different short RNAs show the protein is in a similar closed conformation as the RNA-bound structure of IFIT5 (9) . It is therefore likely that IFIT1 cycles through a similar open/closed conformation to interact with RNA. Binding of IFIT3 may promote the closed conformation of IFIT1, stabilising its interaction with target RNAs. Future efforts will focus on obtaining high-resolution structures of IFIT1:IFIT3 and IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 complexes with and without RNA to address these questions.",
