Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism. However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women. In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject. We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease. Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review helps in the understanding and eradication of the threatening disease.",

The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19) [1] . The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the entire country and to near 50 others all over the world. As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and over 3,000 patients who died. WHO warns that COVID-19 is \"public enemy number 1\" and potentially more powerful than terrorism [2] .",

This review attempts to summarize the research progress in the new and swiftly developing subject area.

Seven days later the sequence of the CoV was released [7] . On January 15, 2020 the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported [6] . Meanwhile, the epidemic rapidly spread to the neighboring cities, provinces, and countries. On January 20, the infection of health-care providers was reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible [8] . On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down with all its public transportation stopped. On January 24 the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the starting site of the infection from an unknown animal source [6] . On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency. By the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and near 50 other countries all over the world (Fig. 2) . As the situation is rapidly evolving, the final scope and severity of the outbreak remain to be determined. On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study on 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients presented a more updated illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).",

B 0 AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 [14] [15] [16] 19] . However, what intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission route is yet to be elucidated. Ji, et al., proposed snakes as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans which involved homologous recombination within the S protein [22] . According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins -long-snouted, anteating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine -are the potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology in a CoV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2 [23] . However, 1% difference spread all over two genomes is still a big difference; thus, conclusive results for concrete evidence are awaited (Fig. 3) . ",

Currently, no detailed study has been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4) . In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-Ilike receptor (RLR) [28] . Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, maturation of dendritic cells, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) which limit the spreading of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens [28] . However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape from the immune responses [29] .",

CD4 + T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8 + T cells directly kill virus-infected cells. T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the defending cells. However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing apoptosis of T cells. The humoral immunity including complements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies is also essential in combating the viral infection [30, 31] . For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV [32] . On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of free radicals locally that can cause severe damages to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, multi-organ failure and even death [33] .",

It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected but symptomless people from transmitting the virus to others [38] .

A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS [59] . Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and imperative for making an effective diagnosis. On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol of using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 \u00d7 10 -18 mol/L to 200 \u00d7 10 -18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipstick in less than an hour without requiring elaborate instrumentation [60] .

However, its effects largely rely on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of TCM. Most of the effective components remain unknown or are vague as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations. Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for patients with light to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages [85] . For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment [86] . Top cure rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), whereas Hubei province, which used TCM in only approximately 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%) [87] .

It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and might interfere with each other [55] .",

In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds [106] . Therefore, infected patients at the early phase or incubation period can produce a large amount of virus during daily activities, causing great difficulty for the control of the epidemic. However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when the patients are severely ill, while most transmission did not happen at the early phase [107] . Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS. Great efforts are currently underway in China including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Although these actions have been dramatically damaging the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the slowdown of the epidemic. The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the downswing phase will last for 3-4 months [108] . However, some other experts are not that optimistic. Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which seems substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020 [109] . Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population [110] .",

In less than two months, it has spread all over China and near 50 other countries globally at the time of this writing. Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS recurring. However, there are some remarkable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for containing the epidemic and treating the patients.",
