Bringing into question whether this anti-viral host 109 response is an innate factor or induced to help at later stages of an infection. Recently, it has been demonstrated that IFITM3 expression, along with 118 several other IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), is high in stem cells potentially as a 119 protection mechanism against viral infection, with expression then lost with 120 differentiation (4). Online databases of IFITM3 RNA expression show large 121 variability in expression in different organs. The protein atlas database 122 suggests that protein levels of IFITM3 are also variable across cell types, 123 however it is likely that these results came from studies using antibodies that 124",

IFITM3 399 expression was measured prior to infection (Figure 4a) However, IFITM3 is not the only anti-viral mechanism induced by IFN 411 stimulation. We therefore investigated the infection rates of IFN-stimulated 412 HEK293-IFITM3 -/cells. As expected, the infection rate was substantially 413 higher in IFITM3 -/cells with no IFN stimulation, but following type I IFN 414 stimulation the infection rate was attenuated to levels comparable to or lower 415 than those seen in un-stimulated HEK293-WT but not as low as in IFN-treated 416 HEK293-WT cells (Figure 4b) .

Low basal expression may put 67 some immune cells, including lymphocytes and lung-resident macrophages, 68 at risk of influenza virus infection. Investigating the induction of IFITM3 by 69 IFN, we find a strong preference for Type I IFN in IFITM3 induction in both cell 70 lines and primary human cells. While myeloid cells can increase expression 71 following stimulation by Type I IFN, lymphocytes show minimal induction of 72 IFITM3 following IFN stimulation, suggesting that they are always at risk of 73 viral infection. Surprisingly, we found that the time it takes for maximal 74 induction of IFITM3 is relatively slow for an interferon-stimulated gene at 75 around 36 hours. Low basal expression and slow induction of IFITM3 could 76 increase the risk of influenza virus infection in selected immune cells. 77 78 Importance 79 Influenza virus infection remains one of the top ten threats to global health, 80 causing significant deaths and hospitalisations across the world each year. 81 Understanding mechanisms for controlling influenza virus infection remain a 82 priority. The interferon-induced transmembrane protein IFITM3 can restrict 83 influenza infection by limiting replication of the virus. The precise 84 mechanisms of how IFITM3 reduced replication of influenza are unknown, 85",
