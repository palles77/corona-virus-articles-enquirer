Since 1994, when Emerging Infectious Diseases made its publication debut, significant strides in the global fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic have been made. The infectious disease community has confronted several other newly emerging pathogens, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah), and, most recently, avian influenza viruses that have caused illness and deaths in humans with the threat of evolution into a pandemic (1) (2) (3) . In addition, historically established infectious diseases, such as West Nile fever, human monkeypox, dengue, tuberculosis, and malaria have reemerged or resurged, sometimes in populations that previously had been relatively exempt from such affronts. Over the past decade, strains of common microbes such as Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis have continued to develop resistance to the drugs that once were effective against them (1) (2) (3) (4) . Such antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which defy conventional therapies and pose a threat to public health, underscore the need for a robust pipeline of new antimicrobial agents based on innovative therapeutic strategies, new vaccines, and other preventive measures (3, 4) .",

            "text": "West Nile virus (WNV), long endemic in Africa, West Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, represents a reemerging disease that only recently arrived in the United States. The virus first appeared in the New York City area in 1999, where WNV-related disease was reported in 62 persons. It has continued to spread throughout the United States in subsequent summers, infecting ever larger populations, particularly in 2003 (34) . Research has led to several promising vaccine candidates against WNV (35) . One of these, based on a licensed yellow fever vaccine virus that contains 2 WNV genes, has been tested in nonhuman primates; it is currently being evaluated in human clinical trials. A second vaccine developed at NIH uses an attenuated dengue virus into which WNV genes have been inserted. This vaccine protects monkeys and horses against WNV infection, and a clinical trial is now underway. Subunit and DNA vaccines against WNV are also in various stages of development and testing. Several innovative therapies also are being tested to treat persons already infected with WNV. In a clinical trial at >60 sites across the United States and Canada, the protective effect of an immunoglobulin product is being tested in hospitalized patients who are at high risk for or who have WNV encephalitis (36) . Technology also has been developed to screen large numbers of chemical compounds for antiviral activity. As of February 28, 2005, 1,500 compounds had been screened in vitro, and 2%-3% were shown to have antiviral activity against WNV. These compounds are undergoing further evaluation in hamster and mouse models of disease. Partnerships with small biotechnology companies have been formed to develop more sensitive and rapid tests for detecting WNV infections. Other studies are ongoing to evaluate the roles of various mosquito vectors and animal reservoirs in virus transmission, to test novel mosquito control methods, and to limit the impact of insecticide resistance on mosquito control (37) .",
