            "text": "While a few studies have provided some insight to more intensive livestock production units such as hog farms (Dunlop et al., 1998; Rajic et al., 2006) , there is no information about antimicrobial drug use (AMU) in western Canadian cow-calf herds. Based on farm cash receipts the beef industry is the largest livestock commodity in Canada (Anon., 2006a) . The provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan contain more than 65% of the beef cow, breeding heifer, and calf populations in Canada (Anon., 2006b) . A better understanding of AMU patterns in this population is essential to develop a baseline and determine Investigators examined antimicrobial drug use practices and reason for treatment as part of a large on-farm observational study of cow-calf herds from western Canada. Reason for treatment and antimicrobial drug use (AMU) were described using data collected during the calving season (January 1 to June 30, 2002) . The study included 28,573 calves and 36,634 cows and heifers from 203 beef herds. All herds had more than 50 cows. Individual animal treatment records and a herd-level standardized questionnaire were collected from every herd. During the period of January 1 to June 30, 2002 at least one treatment was reported in 14% (95% CI, 11-17) of calves and 2.7% (95% CI, 2.2-3.4) of cows and heifers from these herds. The median percent of calves reported as treated per farm was 6.5% (range 0-100%) while the median percent of cows and heifers reported as treated was 0.9% (range 0-15%). Antimicrobial drugs used during the calving season were primarily for disease treatment rather than prevention or growth promotion. Diarrhea was the primary reason for treating calves and metritis was the primary reason for treating cows. Parenteral antimicrobial drugs were the most common formulation used in both calves and cows. The most commonly used antimicrobial drugs in these herds were tetracyclines, sulphonamides, and florfenicol. This study provides baseline estimates of the frequency of antimicrobial drug exposure, the types of drugs used, and diseases treated in these cowcalf herds. The challenges identified in collecting these data can be used to improve the design of future on-farm studies.",

The data used in this study were limited to this time frame for two reasons. First, in western Canadian herds that have cows calving in the winter and early springmonths cows are often confined for ease of monitoring and feeding. Confinement also simplifies identification and treatment of sick animals and the recording of these treatments. In contrast, during the summer and fall months cattle are generally turned out into large pastures where routine observation and identification of sick animals is more difficult and treatment records are more sporadic. The second reason for collecting data during this period is that the majority of treatments in cow-calf herds occur during the calving season. Calving during the winter and spring often exposes young animals to severe weather extremes. Close confinement during this period increases the risk of disease transmission. By restricting the analysis to the period between January and June the investigators captured the most accurate treatment records available for these herds during the time frame when the majority of treatment episodes were expected to occur. Producers reported individual animal treatments in a record book originally designed for the primary health and productivity study. Treatment type was reported as a coded pick list: injectable antimicrobial, oral antimicrobial, oral and injectable antimicrobial, fluids, and other. Coded lists were also provided to standardize the responses for class of animal, reason for treatment, and type of treatment. A notes section allowed producers to write in any comments. Where completed by the producers, the notes section was used by investigators to help further classify diagnoses or treatments.",

Future studies should focus on working with producers to prospectively report the amount and type of each antimicrobial used to more accurately assess antimicrobial drug exposure. While the baseline health and productivity study provided a unique opportunity to collect information about on-farm treatment practices, the data collection tools were not specifically designed to measure the amount and frequency of individual antimicrobial drugs used in these herds.

Another potentially related finding was that female calves were less likely to be treated than male calves. This could be because male calves are often larger than females (Bellows et al., 1987) . Larger calves are more likely to experience delayed parturition, increased fetal stress, and reduced vigor; potentially negatively affecting passive transfer and calf health. Calves were also more likely to be treated in herds where more cows or heifers were treated.
