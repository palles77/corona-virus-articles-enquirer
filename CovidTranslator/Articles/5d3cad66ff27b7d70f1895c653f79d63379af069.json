The medium contained 2% fetal bovine serum. Subsequently, cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for three days until complete CPE was observed in the infected and untreated virus controls. Cell viability was determined with an MTS assay by incubating the cells with AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) and measuring the optical density of each well at 490 or 498 nm using a microplate reader. Raw optical density values were converted to percentage of untreated and uninfected cell controls after subtraction of background values obtained with virus controls. The concentration of compound that inhibits virus-induced cell death by 50% (50% effective concentration [EC 50 ]) was calculated by nonlinear regression analysis. Cytotoxicity of ITZ was assessed in a similar set-up, and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) values were derived from cell viability values determined with an MTS assay. Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate.",

            "text": "In vitro DHE and PI4P transport assays Previously described liposomal assays (Mesmin et al., 2013) were used to test the sterol and PI4P transfer activities of OSBP (schematically depicted in Figures 6A and 6B, respectively) . Briefly, sterol transfer is measured using the fluorescent cholesterol analog dehydroergosterol (DHE). DHE is transferred by OSBP from ER-like liposomes (ER like ) covered with VAP-A to Golgi-like liposomes (Golgil ike ) doped with dansyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DNS-PE). Upon DHE transfer, there will be F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from DHE to DNS-PE due to the close proximity between the two fluorophores. In the PI4P-transfer assay, PI4P is transported by OSBP from Golgi-like liposomes to ER-like acceptor liposomes and detected using a sensor consisting of the FAPP1 PHdomain labeled with the fluorophore NBD ( NBD PH). When the sensor is bound to PI4P on the Golgi-like liposomes doped with rhodamine-PE (Rho-PE), NBD fluorescence is quenched by the rhodamine. Upon transfer of PI4P to the ER-like liposomes, the sensor moves from the Golgi-like to the ER-like liposomes and NBD-fluorescence is dequenched. Egg PC (L-\u03b1-phosphatidylcholine), liver PI (L-\u03b1-phosphatidylinositol), brain PS (L-\u03b1phosphatidylserine), brain PI4P (L-\u03b1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate), Dansyl (DNS)-PE (1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl)), Rhodamine (Rhod)-PE (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)), DOGS-NTA-Ni 2+ (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid)succinyl]) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Cholesterol and dehydroergosterol (DHE) were from Sigma Aldrich. The concentration of DHE in stock solution in methanol was determined by UV-spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient of 13,000 M -1 .cm -1 . Full-length OSBP, VAP-A[8-212]His 6, NBD-PH FAPP1 and Arf1 were purified as described previously (Mesmin et al., 2013) . To prepare liposomes, lipids from chloroform solutions were mixed at the desired molar ratio, and the solvent was removed in a rotary evaporator. The lipid film was hydrated in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.2 and 120 mM potassium acetate (HK buffer) to give a suspension of large multilamellar liposomes. The suspension was then frozen and thawed five times and extruded through polycarbonate filters of 0.1 \u03bcm pore size using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). Unilamellar liposomes were stored in the dark and used within 2 days. For all transport experiment, ER-like liposomes contain: egg PC/brain PS/DOGS-NTA-Ni2 + (93/5/2 mol/mol) and Golgi-like liposomes contain: egg PC/liver PE/brain PS/liver PI/DNS-PE (63.5/19/5/10/2.5 mol/mol). Fluorescence experiments were performed in a Shimadzu RF-5301-PC spectrofluorimeter. The sample (volume 600 \u03bcl) was placed in a cylindrical quartz cell, continuously stirred with a small magnetic bar and equilibrated at 37\u00b0C. For DHE transfer assays, Golgi-like liposomes with 2.5 mol% DNS-PE (63.3 \u03bcM total lipids) were loaded with Arf1.GTP (0.3 \u03bcM) and incubated with 1 \u03bcM VapA[8-212]His 6 in HKM buffer (HK buffer supplemented with 1 mM MgCl 2 ) in the presence of 25-OH, ITZ or other azoles (different stock concentration in DMSO, DMSO/buffer final ratio v/v 1/100), prior to the addition of ER-like liposomes supplemented with 18 mol% DHE (63.3 \u03bcM total lipids) and of OSBP (100 nM final concentration). The sterol transport activity of OSBP was monitored by FRET between DHE and DNS-PE, measured at 525 nm (bandwidth 5 nm) upon excitation at 310 nm (bandwidth 1.5 nm). Methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (1 mM) was used to determine the maximal FRET signal due to full sterol equilibration between ER-like and Golgi-like liposomes. For PI4P transfer assay, Golgi-like liposomes with 2% Rhod-PE (300 \u03bcM total lipids) were incubated in HKM buffer with 250 nM NBD-PH FAPP , 3 \u03bcM VAP-A[8-212]His 6 in the presence or not of ITZ or other azoles (at different stock concentration, in DMSO). PI4P transport was followed by measuring the NBD emission signal at 510 nm (bandwidth 10 nm) upon excitation at 460 nm (bandwidth 1.5 nm). ER-like liposomes (300 \u03bcM lipid) and 100 nM OSBP were sequentially added. Maximal signal corresponding to PI4P equilibration between both types of liposomes was determined by mixing control ER-and Golgi-like liposomes, each containing 1% PI4P.",

After two days, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS and pelleted again. The cell pellet was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C, or used directly for a purification. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% nonidet-P40 with protease inhibitor complex [Roche]) for 15 min on ice, centrifuged for 20 min at ~20Kxg, and bound to StrepTactin beads (IBA). Beads were loaded in a column (Bio-Rad), unbound material was drained and beads were washed with washing buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Proteins were eluted in elution buffer (washing buffer with 10% glycerol, 2.5mM biotin and protease inhibitor complex), aliquoted, snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C. Purity of the protein preparations was checked by SDS-PAGE stained with GelCode Blue (Pierce) and protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). For MST measurements, proteins were thawed on ice, centrifuged for 5 min at full speed in a table top centrifuge to remove any protein aggregates, and diluted in MST buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 ) supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20. ITZ was serially diluted in 16 two-fold dilution steps in MST buffer with Tween-20. Protein and ITZ dilutions were mixed, loaded in standard treated capillaries (NanoTemper Technologies) and measured using a NanoTemper Monolith NT.115 instrument (NanoTemper Technologies) equipped with a blue filter set, which is compatible with GFP fluorescence. Measurements were performed at 22-24\u00b0C, 20% MST power, 20% LED power. Individual experiments were analyzed using the NTAnalysis software (NanoTemper Technologies), normalized fluorescence values of individual experiments (Fnorm[1/1000]) were exported to Excel, base-line corrected by substracting the average of the first three values (lowest ITZ concentrations, plateau for OSBP with no ITZ bound), and normalized to maximal binding using the amplitude calculated for each measurement by the NTAnalysis software. Data of three individual experiments were averaged. Data were plotted and a curve was fitted with the fit function from the law of mass action. Figure 2 , and Renilla luciferase levels were measured after 7 hr. Acute toxicity of the drug treatments was analyzed in parallel using an MTS assay as in Figure 1B (C). The toxicity of treatment with 100 \u03bcM ketoconazole prevents drawing a conclusion about any antiviral effect of this drug concentration on CVB3. (D) HeLa R19 cells were infected with RLuc-EMCV, treated with Hedgehog pathway antagonists as in Figure 2 , and Renilla luciferase levels were measured after 6 hr. (E) HeLa R19 cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM antifungal azoles for 6 hr, fixed and cholesterol was stained with filipin. Cholesterol was redistributed only by ITZ, posaconazole and ketoconazole, but not by fluconazole or voriconazole. (F) HeLa R19 cells were infected with RLuc-EMCV, treated with \u03b2estradiol as in Figure 2 , and Renilla luciferase levels were measured after 6 hr. Scale bars correspond to 10 \u03bcm. Asterisks indicate statistical significance compared to the DMSO control. D, DMSO; Gu, Guanidine HCl (known replication inhibitor of CVB3); Posa, posaconazole; Keto, ketoconazole; Flu, fluconazole; Vori, voriconazole. (A) HeLa cells stably expressing the PI4P-sensor FAPP1-PH-GFP were treated with DMSO, 1 \u03bcM BF738735 (PI4KIII\u03b2 inhibitor), or 10 \u03bcM ITZ for 2.5 hr, fixed and processed for microscopy. (B) HeLa R19 cells were treated as in (B), fixed and stained with an antibody against PI4P. (C) ITZ does not inhibit PI4P accumulation in infected cells. HeLa R19 cells were infected with CVB3 at MOI 10 and immediately after infection treated with DMSO or 10 \u03bcM ITZ, which does not fully inhibit replication. At 5 hr p.i., the cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against 3A and PI4P. Scale bars correspond to 10 \u03bcm. HeLa R19 cells were transfected with siRNA against OSBP or a scrambled siRNA as a negative control as in Figure 3D . After 48 hr, cells were fixed and immunostained for OSBP and GM130 as Golgi marker, and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Knockdown of OSBP at the protein level is evident by a weaker OSBP staining both on Golgi structures and throughout the cytoplasm. Of note, OSBP knockdown caused the Golgi to become less compact, which at the same time demonstrates that knockdown was efficient enough to induce a physiological effect. The scale bar corresponds to 10 \u03bcm. Huh 9-13 cells carrying a HCV genotype 1b subgenomic replicon were treated with ITZ or other antifungal azoles and replication was determined after 3 days by Q-PCR. Values are plotted as % of untreated control (UTC), experiments were performed in triplicates and mean \u00b1 SEM are plotted. EC50 values are means \u00b1 SD from an experiment performed in triplicate. For all compounds, 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) were >30 \u03bcM (data not shown).",

Specifically, BGM cells were infected with CVB3 at MOI 50.

Full-length (~100 kDa) OSBP was cleaved into a ~43 kDa fragment, which corresponds to an N-terminal part comprising the PH-domain and the FFAT-motif, and two fragments of ~35 kDa and ~20 kDa, which are derived from the ORD and which retain the lipid transfer activities (Mesmin et al., 2013) . (B) GFP-OSBP-SII was expressed in HEK293T cells and purified using StrepTactin beads. Cell lysate from a typical GFP-OSBP-SII expression and purified protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the gel was stained using GelCode Blue (Pierce). (C) Thermophoretic curves of a representative MicroScale Thermophoresis experiment to investigate the interaction between ITZ and GFP. Each of the 16 curves represents the thermophoretic behavior of GFP-OSBP-SII with a different concentration of ITZ. All curves are from the same measurement. Figure  4 . HeLa R19 cells transfected with GFP-OSBP and treated with DMSO, 10 \u00b5M of ITZ or 10 nM OSW-1 were imaged O/N by live-cell confocal laser scanning microscopy. During the first 30 minutes, images were taken as fast as possible (~1.5 minute intervals), then intervals were stepwise increased to 30 min from 3.5 hr onward. Representative groups of cells are shown. The time after addition of the compounds for each image is indicated as hr : min : sec. The size of the scale bar corresponds to 10\u03bcm.
