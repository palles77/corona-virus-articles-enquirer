            "text": "Chloroplast genetic engineering offers several advantages, including high levels of transgene expression, transgene containment via maternal inheritance, and multi-gene expression in a single transformation event. Oral delivery is facilitated by hyperexpression of vaccine antigens against cholera, tetanus, anthrax, plague, or canine parvovirus (4%-31% of total soluble protein, TSP) in transgenic chloroplasts (leaves) or non-green plastids (carrots, tomato) as well as the availability of antibiotic free selectable markers or the ability to excise selectable marker genes. Hyperexpression of several therapeutic proteins, including human serum albumin (11.1% TSP), somatotropin (7% TSP), interferon-alpha (19% TSP), interferon-gamma (6% TSP), and antimicrobial peptide (21.5% TSP), facilitates efficient and economic purification. Also, the presence of chaperones and enzymes in chloroplasts facilitates assembly of complex multisubunit proteins and correct folding of human blood proteins with proper disulfide bonds. Functionality of chloroplast-derived vaccine antigens and therapeutic proteins has been demonstrated by several assays, including the macrophage lysis assay, GM1-ganglioside binding assay, protection of HeLA cells or human lung carcinoma cells against encephalomyocarditis virus, systemic immune response, protection against pathogen challenge, and growth or inhibition of cell cultures. Purification of human proinsulin has been achieved using novel purification strategies (inverse temperature transition property) that do not require expensive column chromatography techniques. Thus, transgenic chloroplasts are ideal bioreactors for production of functional human and animal therapeutic proteins in an environmentally friendly manner.",

The uses of vaccines and therapeutic proteins have great potential but are limited by their cost of production, distribution, and delivery. Modified mammalian cells are used for producing therapeutic proteins, which have the advantage of resulting in products that are similar to their natural counterparts. These cells can be cultured on a limited scale but production is quite expensive. Bacteria can be used for large-scale production of proteins, but the products differ from the natural products considerably. For example, the proteins that are usually glycosylated in humans are not glycosylated by bacteria. Moreover, many proteins are expressed in Escherichia coli on a large scale, but sometimes they may differ in conformation with eventual precipitation due to a lack of proper folding and disulfide bridges (Daniell et al. 2001d ).",

Plants are now one of the new hosts for the production of biopharmaceuticals, polymers, vaccines, enzymes, plasma proteins, and antibodies. There are many advantages in production of recombinant proteins in plants. Primarily, plant systems are more economical in that they can be produced on a large scale rather than using industrial methods (fermentation of bacteria, yeast or cultured animal or human cell lines) that are very expensive. Also, there is no need to maintain the cold chain as the plant parts expressing the vaccine or plant extracts can be stored and transported at room temperature. Plants have the ability to carry out posttranslational modifications similar to naturally occurring systems. There is also minimized risk of contamination from potential human pathogens, as plants are not hosts for human infectious agents (Giddings et al. 2000) . If therapeutic proteins are delivered orally, then the purification step from plants can be eliminated. Other advantages of foodbased vaccines include the low cost of raw material and convenient storage; the cost of syringes and needles in delivery of vaccines is eliminated, which thereby eliminates blood-borne pathogens.",

Besides such high expression levels, there are several other advantages of chloroplast genetic engineering over nuclear transformation. Chloroplast genomes defy the laws of Mendelian inheritance in that they are maternally inherited in most crops (Zhang et al. 2003 ) and thus minimize outcrossing of transgenic pollen with related weeds or crops. Even if the pollen from plants that exhibit maternal inheritance contains metabolically active plastids, the plastid DNA is lost during pollen maturation and is not transmitted to the next generation (Daniell 2002) . Therefore, the chloroplast expression system is an environmentally friendly approach. Also, chloroplasts have the ability to express multiple genes in a single transformation event. Expression of polycistrons in transgenic chloroplasts is a unique feature, which facilitates the expression of entire pathways in a single transformation event (De Cosa et al. 2001; Daniell and Dhingra 2002) . For the first time, a complete bacterial operon was successfully expressed in transgenic chloroplasts, resulting in the formation of stable cry2Aa2 crystals (De Cosa et al. 2001) . This should facilitate expression of polyvalent vaccines or multisubunit proteins in transgenic chloroplasts.",

Chaperones present in chloroplasts facilitate correct folding and assembly of monoclonal antibody in transgenic chloroplasts (Daniell et al. 2004a ) and also result in fully functional human therapeutic proteins, as seen in interferon alpha and gamma (Falconer 2002; Leelavathi and Reddy 2003) . Chloroplasts can be a good place to store the biosynthetic products that could otherwise be harmful when accumulated in cytosol (Bogorad 2000) . This was demonstrated when cholera toxin B subunit was accumulated in large quantities in transgenic chloroplasts and it had no toxic effect (Daniell et al. 2001b) , whereas when accumulated in the cytosol in very small quantities, CTB was toxic (Mason et al. 1998) . Similarly, trehalose, which is used as a preservative in the pharmaceutical industry, was toxic when accumulated in cytosol but was nontoxic when compartmentalized within chloroplasts (Lee et al. 2003) .

            "text": "The main reason for the high cost of pharmaceutical protein production is purification of recombinant proteins. Therefore, novel protein purification strategies can be used that do not require the use of expensive column chromatography. For instance, a synthetic protein-based polymer gene (GVGVP) 121 has been expressed in E. coli and a very high expression level was achieved such that polymer inclusion bodies were formed that occupied nearly 90% of the cell volume (Daniell et al. 1997; Guda et al. 2000) . (GVGVP) 121 exhibits inverse temperature transition properties, making it soluble in water below room temperature, but aggregates into a more ordered, viscoelastic state, called a coacervate, at 37\u00b0C (Daniell et al. 1997; Guda et al. 2000) . The inverse temperature transition property makes purification easier and less expensive in aqueous solutions simply by raising the temperature. In addition, this property makes (GVGVP) 121 an ideal fusion protein for purification. To demonstrate this, the proinsulin gene was fused to a smaller version of this biopolymer (GVGVP) 40 with inverse temperature transition properties and was expressed in E. coli (Daniell et al. 2004a) . At 4\u00b0C, the biopolymer exists as an extended molecule, but when incubated at 42\u00b0C, it folds into dynamic structures called \u03b2-spirals that further aggregate by hydrophobic association to form twisted filaments (Urry et al. 1996) . Therefore, this principle was successfully used to purify the fusion protein simply by raising the temperature to 42\u00b0C and was analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The presence of polymer in the proinsulin-polymer fusion protein was confirmed by negatively staining the SDS-PAGE gels with 0.3 M Cucl2 (Fig. 1a) . Copper stained gels, when illuminated obliquely, show dark bands against a light, semiopaque background. The same gel was stained with Coomassie R-250. The sulphonic acid groups in the dye (Coomassie R-250) form ion pairs with lysine and arginine in the protein, which are not present in the polymer but are present in proinsulin. Since the Coomassie R-250 stained the polypeptide, it confirms the presence of fusion protein (Fig. 1b) . After purification, the fusion protein can be cleaved with suitable enzymes and the polymer can be discarded in the pellet fraction by another round of polymerization at 42\u00b0C followed by centrifugation. This novel purification strategy should significantly decrease the purification cost because of the elimination of column chromatography.",

But once the trait has been established, the antibiotic resistance gene has only one purpose: producing its products. One major concern is horizontal transfer of the antibiotic resistance genes to other related or unrelated organisms. However, now chloroplasts can be genetically modified without the use of antibiotic resistance genes. There are several ways of doing this. For example, the spinach betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) gene has been developed as a selectable marker to transform the chloroplast genome (Daniell et al. 2001c,e) . The toxic betaine aldehyde (BA) is converted to nontoxic glycine betaine by the chloroplast BADH enzyme. This glycine betaine also serves as an osmoprotectant and confers salt tolerance (Kumar et al. 2004) . The BADH enzyme is present in only a few plant species that are adapted to salty and dry environments.",

For the first time, stable and highly efficient plastid transformation of carrot using non-green tissues as explants, regenerated via somatic embryogenesis, has been reported (Kumar et al. 2004) . A useful plant trait (salt tolerance) has been expressed for the first time in a non-solanaceous crop via the chloroplast genome. The carrotspecific plastid transformation vector pDD-Dc-aadA/BADH was constructed and carrot callus was bombarded. The bombarded callus was plated on selection medium containing 150 mg/l spectinomycin to obtain spectinomycin-resistant transgenic lines. The BADH enzyme activity was assayed in crude extracts of protein from both transformed and untransformed carrot cell cultures. BADH enzyme in the presence of betaine aldehyde converts NAD+ to NADH and the reaction rate was measured by an increase in absorbance at 340 nm due to the reduction of NAD+ (Kumar et al. 2004 ). Crude extracts from transgenic plastids showed higher levels of BADH activity when compared to untransformed tissue ( Fig. 2a) . High BADH activity was observed in leaves, tap roots, and cells in suspension culture but the difference in activity may be due to variation in plastid genome copy numbers. The high BADH activity in carrot taproot may be due to a large number of chromoplasts, which is evident by the orange color (Fig. 2b) . Also, the protein expression in carrot cells, root, and shoot was tested using Western blot analysis (Fig. 2c) . These results were consistent with the BADH enzyme activity. Also, glycine betaine is found in many higher plants, bacteria, and mammalian animals, which they accumulate under conditions of water or salt stress and acts as an osmoprotectant (Figueroa-Soto et al. 1999) . In plants and bacteria, glycine betaine can build up the cytoplasmic osmotic strength without preventing any cellular functions. BADH was reported to be present in porcine kidneys localized in both cortex and medulla (Figueroa-Soto et al. 1999 ).",

Somatic embryos of carrot are single-cell-derived and multiply through recurrent embryogenesis, which provides a uniform source of cell culture and a homogeneous single source, which is a requirement for the production of human therapeutic proteins. Oral delivery of therapeutic proteins via edible carrots preserves the structural integrity of the proteins, as no cooking is needed.

Higher expression levels (up to 31.1% TSP) were obtained when CTB-2L21 fusion protein was expressed in transgenic chloroplasts (Molina et al. 2004) . The difference in the expression levels of the CTB gene was due to the presence of a ribosome-binding site (GGAGG, 4.1% TSP) or the 5\u2032 UTR of the psbA gene (31.1% TSP). CTB synthesized from transgenic chloroplasts in both investigations assembled into functional oligomers and were antigenically identical to purified native CTB. CTB has the highest affinity to bind with gangliosides (GM1), which are the natural toxin receptors in the intestinal epithelial cells. The functionality of CTB was determined by the GM1-ganglioside ELISA binding assay (Fig. 3) , where the plates were coated first with GM1-gangliosides and BSA, which was then plated with the total soluble protein from the transformed and the untransformed plants and bacterial CTB. Then the absorbance of the GM1-ganglioside-CTB-antibody complex was measured. The bacterial CTB and chloroplast-synthesized CTB showed a strong affinity for the G M1ganglioside complex, confirming that the antigenic sites necessary for the binding of CTB to GM1 were conserved.

The present vaccine for anthrax is produced by cell-free filtrate of toxigenic, nonencapsulated strain of B. anthracis (Baillie 2001) . In addition to the protective antigen (PA), the immunogenic portion, trace amounts of lethal factor and edema factor are present in the filtrate, which are considered to be toxic and cause side effects (Ivins et al. 1995; Baillie 2001; Joellenback et al. 2002) . The PA heptamerizes and binds itself to the host cell receptor. This can now bind to lethal factor or edema factor. When bound to lethal factor, the toxin stimulates the release of interleukins-1\u03b2 by macrophages and other cytokines that lead to sudden death. For the above reasons and also because of the limited supply of the current vaccine, biothrax (formerly anthrax vaccine adsorbed, or AVA), there is an urgent need for an improved and pure vaccine. Therefore, the B. anthracis 83-kDa PA was expressed in transgenic tobacco chloroplasts. The PA gene was cloned into the chloroplast transformation vector (pLD-JW1) along with psbA regulatory signals to enhance translation. The crude plant extracts contained up to 2.5 mg PA/ g fresh weight (Daniell et al. 2004b ). The PA protein as a percentage of total soluble protein expressed in pLD-JW1 plants was determined for 3 and 5 days of continuous illumination. A maximum 18.1% and 13.4% PA in the total soluble protein was achieved (Fig. 4) . The maximum levels of expression were observed in mature leaves under continuous illumination. Also, Western blots were performed using two different detergents in the extraction buffer, CHAPS and SDS, and both extracted PA equally well.

Powdered leaf was stored at \u221280\u00b0C for several months and then Western blots were performed, showing no noticeable decrease in PA quantity or functionality. This should facilitate the long-term storage of harvested leaves before PA is extracted for vaccine production. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, and furin proteolytic sites present in PA expressed in transgenic chloroplasts were protected in that only PA 83 was observed. The functionality of the antigen was determined by its ability to internalize the lethal factor and cause the lysis of cultured macrophage cells, which is termed as the macrophage lysis assay (Fig. 5) . The percentage macrophage viability was determined using the ability of live but not dead cells to reduce a water-soluble yellow dye, 5diphenyltetrazolium bromide) to an insoluble purple formazan product (Daniell et al. 2004b ). The PA also showed heptamerization and cleaved properly. With an average yield of 172 mg of PA per plant using the experimental transgenic cultivar grown in greenhouse, 400 million doses of vaccine (free of contaminants) could be produced per acre. The yield could increase further by 18-fold when a commercial cultivar is used rather than the experimental cultivar.",

There are three different forms of plague. Bubonic plague, the most common form of plague, is caused by infected fleas. When it enters the lymph nodes, the bacterium causes swelling of the nodes and forms buboes; the other forms are septicemic plague and pneumatic plague. The current vaccine available is a killed whole subunit vaccine, which is moderately effective against bubonic plague and ineffective against the other two forms of the plague (Titball and Williamson 2001) . Several subunit vaccines have been evaluated for immunogenicity against Y. pestis. CaF1 and LcrV are the most effective subunit vaccines so far against Y. pestis. F1 is a capsular protein located on the surface of the bacterium with antiphagocytic properties. The V antigen is a component of the Y. pestis type III secretion system and it may form part of an injectosome. The fusion protein of F1-V expressed in E. coli has been shown to be safe and immunogenic when mice were challenged with Y. pestis (Williamson et al., 1997) . The fusion protein F1-V was expressed in transgenic chloroplasts consisting of the F1 antigen fused at its carboxy terminus to the amino terminus of the V antigen. Western blot and ELISA were performed and samples were collected from plants under continuous illumination from days 0-5 from young, mature, and old leaves (Fig. 6) . The maximum expression levels were observed in mature leaves, which is as high as 14.8% of the total soluble protein (Arlen et al. 2008) . Further studies need to be done to confirm immunogenicity. Since Y. pestis is one of the category A biological warfare agents and there is no proper vaccine, improved vaccine is a high priority.",

The 2L21 peptide, which confers protection to dogs against virulent canine parvovirus (CPV), was expressed in tobacco chloroplasts as a fusion protein with cholera toxin B (CTB) and with the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The maximum levels of protein expression were achieved with CTB-2L21, 7.49 mg/g fresh weight (equivalent to 31.1% total soluble protein) and with GFP-2L21, 5.96 mg/g fresh weight (equivalent to 22.6% of total soluble protein, Molina et al. 2004 ; Fig. 7 ). The expression levels were also dependent on the age of the plant. Mature plants accumulated the highest amounts of protein when compared to the young and senescent plants. This shows the importance of the plant's harvesting time. Also, the chimeric protein retained the pentamerization and G M1 -ganglioside-binding properties of the native CTB. When mice were immunized intraperitoneally with the leaf extracts from CTB-2L21, mice immunized with CTB-2L21 elicited anti-2L21 antibodies able to recognize VP2 protein from CPV (Fig. 8) .

The world needs more than 500 tons annually, representing a market value of more than $1.5 billion. HSA was produced in a wide variety of microbial systems but no system is commercially feasible yet. Expression of functional HSA in a transgenic chloroplast expression system is advantageous because of the inexpensive production costs and absence of human pathogens. This protein was expressed in transgenic chloroplasts under the translational control of a Shine Dalgarno sequence, 5\u2032 psbA region or the cry2Aa2 UTR. Different expression levels were obtained in transgenic plants with different regulatory sequences; for example, potted transgenic plants regulated by Shine-Dalgarno sequence showed 0.02% TSP, while 7.2% and 0.08% TSP HSA was observed in plants regulated by chloroplast 5\u2032 psbA or heterologous cry2Aa2 UTR, respectively. Expression in seedlings with Shine-Dalgarno control was 0.8% total protein of HSA, while 1.6% TP was observed with 5\u2032 psbA control and 5.9% TP under cry2Aa2 UTR control. The low levels of HSA accumulation in mature plants under the control of SD may be due to excessive proteolytic degradation and poor rates of translation. As 5\u2032 psbA region is light-regulated, under continuous light illumination for 50 h, the HSA quantity in mature leaves was maximum: 11.1% of the total soluble protein (Fern\u00e1ndez-San Mill\u00e1n et al. 2003) .

When produced in E. coli, IGF-1 cannot produce the mature form, as disulfide bonds cannot be formed in E. coli cytoplasm. Since the IGF-1 has codons suitable for the eukaryotic environment, codon was optimized for chloroplast to increase the levels of expression in transgenic chloroplasts. PCR and Southern blot analysis confirmed the chloroplast integration of IGF-1 gene. ELISA was performed to quantify the expression levels of IGF-1 from both native and synthetic genes in transgenic chloroplasts and the expression levels were as high as 32% of the total soluble protein (Ruiz 2002 ; Fig. 12 ). However, quantification of expression of IGF-1 was complicated by the ZZ-tag used for purification and levels of expression should be verified using antibodies that do not cross-react with the ZZ-tag.

Magainin, secreted from the skin of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), is a broad-spectrum topical agent, a systemic antibiotic and a wound-healing and anticancer agent (Zasloff 1987; Jacob and Zasloff 1994; DeGray et al. 2001 ). Magainin has affinity for the negatively charged phospholipids in the outer leaflet of the prokaryotic membrane. A magainin analog, MSI-99, was expressed in transgenic chloroplasts and expression levels up to 21.5% of total soluble protein were obtained (DeGray et al. 2001; Daniell et al. 2001a) . The effectiveness of the lytic peptide expressed in transgenic chloroplasts was tested with a multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and this resulted in 96% growth inhibition of the pathogen (Fig. 13) . MSI-99 was most effective against Pseudomonas syringae requiring only 1 \u03bcg/1,000 bacteria based on the study of minimum inhibitory concentration of MSI-99.",

Though large numbers of therapeutic proteins have been produced in plants, only a few have entered clinical trials. The anti-Streptococcus mutans secretory antibody for the prevention of dental caries is the only plant-derived antibody currently in phase II clinical trials (Larrick and Thomas 2001) . Based on chloroplast's ability to form fully active and assembled proteins, a codon-optimized and humanized gene encoding a chimeric monoclonal antibody (IgA/G, Guy's 13) under the control of a specific 5\u2032-untranslated region, was used to synthesize monoclonal antibodies in transgenic chloroplasts. Guy's 13 was developed to prevent dental caries, which is caused by Streptococcus mutans (Daniell and Wycoff 2001; Daniell et al. 2001a; . Integration of the chimeric antibody gene into chloroplast genome was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Western blot analysis showed the expression of heavy and light chains as well as fully assembled antibody (Fig. 14) , suggesting the presence of chaperones for proper protein folding and enzymes for formation of disulfide bond in transgenic chloroplasts. However, expression levels should be enhanced further to facilitate commercialization.",

The proven functionality and the high expression levels of vaccine antigens and therapeutic proteins in transgenic chloroplasts hold the promise for unlimited quantities of production, but the cost of purification is still prohibitive. This can be overcome by the oral delivery of vaccine antigens and therapeutic proteins or by using the novel purification strategies described in this review. CTB-GM1-ganglioside binding ELISA assay. Plates, coated first with GM1-ganglioside and bovine serum albumin (BSA), respectively, were irrigated with total soluble plant protein from chloroplast transgenic lines (3, 7) and 300 ng of purified bacterial CTB. The absorbance of the GM1-ganglioside-CTB-antibody complex in each case was measured at 405 nm. Total soluble protein from untransformed plants was used as the negative control Macrophage cytotoxic assays for extracts from transgenic plants. Supernatant samples from T1 pLD-JW1 tested (proteins extracted in buffer containing no detergent and MTT added after 5 h). pLD-JW1 (extract stored 2 days); pLD-JW1 (extract stored 7 days); PA 5 \u03bcg/ml; control wild type (extract stored 2 days); control wild type (extract stored 7 days); control wild type no LF (extract stored 2 days); control wild type no LF (extract stored 7 days); control pLD-JW1 no LF (extract stored 2 days); control pLD-JW1 no LF (extract stored 7 days) Demonstration of IFN\u03b1 2b functionality by the ability of IFN\u03b1 2b to protect HeLa cells against the cytopathic effect of encephalomyocarditis virus.
