Mutations were introduced in its protease domain, Pro39, and the mutated proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and their activity in vitro was compared to that of the wild type Pro39. Mutations M781T, A662T and G577R, found in temperaturesensitive virus strains, rendered the enzyme temperature-sensitive in vitro as well. Five conserved residues were required for the proteolytic activity of Pro39. Changes affecting Cys 478 , His 548 , and Trp 549 resulted in complete inactivation of the enzyme, whereas the replacements N600D and N605D significantly impaired its activity. The importance of Trp 549 for the proteolytic cleavage specificity is discussed and a new structural motif involved in substrate recognition by cysteine proteases is proposed.",

All these function as virus-specific components of the membrane-associated RNA polymerase [2, 10] . The processing intermediates P123 plus nsP4 are needed for the synthesis of complementary 42S RNA early in infection [11, 12] , while the complete cleavage products are responsible for the synthesis of positive sense 42S RNA genomes and the subgenomic 26S mRNA [2, 11, 12] .",

Temperature-shift experiments performed with these mutants have provided invaluable information on the biology of SFV, particularly on RNA synthesis and the function of the individual non-structural proteins [20] [21] [22] [23] . Sequence analysis of the cDNA derived from the genome of those ts mutants has shown that ts4, ts6, and ts11 mutations are the result of single aminoacid changes in the protease domain of nsP2, M781T, A662T and G577R, respectively [23, 24] . Despite these substitutions being located in poorly conserved regions of the nsP2 protease, they cause functional defects in virus propagation. The ts4 mutation has been shown to result in the halt of viral RNA synthesis and processing of the nonstructural polyprotein at the restrictive temperature of 39\u00b0C [23, 25, 26] . The ts6 and ts11 mutants also displayed an RNA negative phenotype, failing to synthesize any viral RNA at 39\u00b0C [18] .",

This, in turn, resulted in preparates with lower degree of purity, as can be seen in Fig. 1 . Since the two mutant proteins showed a tendency to aggregate, particularly when submitted to the changes of ionic strength associated to many chromatography techniques, further purification steps were not successful and the shown preparates were used for the experiments reported here.",

Under those conditions, the reaction was quite fast, reaching a plateau approximately after 10 min (Fig. 3, panels A and B) . For a quantitative comparison of the enzymatic activity of the ts and the wt Pro39, we lowered the rate of the reaction by decreasing the amount of enzyme in the samples. At a Pro39:Trx34 molar ratio of 1:32 the reaction proceeded linearly for a period of up to 10 min (Fig. 3C) , allowing accurate determination of the reaction rate. Thus, these conditions were used to compare the activity of the dif-ferent proteases at both the permissive and restrictive temperatures. For this, Pro39 was preincubated in buffer for 2 min in the absence of Trx34 in order to avoid any possible contribution of the substrate on the stability of the enzyme. Upon substrate addition, samples were withdrawn at time points 1, 2 and 5 min, and analyzed. We found the activity of the wt and mutant Pro39 to be practically identical when the reaction was performed at 28\u00b0C. However, at 39\u00b0C the activity of the ts enzymes clearly decreased to levels of 55 \u00b1 8% (mean of 3 experiments), 55 \u00b1 4% (2) , and 65 \u00b1 3% (3) for ts4, ts6, and ts11, respectively, whereas the activity of the wt Pro39 was much less affected by the rise in temperature (82 \u00b1 12%, mean of 5 experiments). From the results of the experiments carried out with the wt enzyme at different enzyme:substrate ratios, an apparent K M of approximately 250 lM and a V max close to 160 pmol/min was calculated for Pro39 at 28\u00b0C (not shown).",

In order to investigate the effect of these mutations on the catalytic activity of SFV protease directly, Asn residues at the corresponding positions of Pro39 were replaced by Asp. Both N600D and N605D Pro39 mutants showed significantly reduced efficiency of the in vitro Trx34 substrate cleavage compared to the wt enzyme (Fig. 4) . Because of the lower purity of these samples, it could be argued that the detected activity, or at least part of it, could be due to the presence of contaminant bacterial proteins able to act upon the same bond on Trx34. It should be noted, however, that we were not able to detect any endogeneous protease activity capable of specific cleavage of Trx34 neither in E. coli BL21 extracts nor in the purified mutant Pro39 preparations. In the latter case, prolonged incubation of these samples at room temperature resulted in aggregation and precipitation of the mutant enzyme, whereas the bulk of contaminating proteins remained soluble. After separation of the precipitated Pro39 by centrifugation, the resulting supernatant did not show any detectable activity against Trx34 (not shown), suggesting that the observed reduced enzymatic activity of the preparates was due to the mutant Pro39 and not to the presence of the contaminating proteins.",

The cleavage between nsP1 and nsP2 occurs only in cis, whereas the nsP2/nsP3 site is processed in trans and requires the presence of a free nsP2 terminus. However, the site between nsP3 and nsP4 requires only the protease activity and a short specific polypeptide stretch as a substrate for efficient cleavage [15] .

The activities of the mutant enzymes were assayed at 28 and 39\u00b0C, which are the permissive and restrictive temperatures for the ts viruses, respectively. The wt and the mutant Pro39 cleaved the Trx34 substrate with practically the same efficiency at 28\u00b0C. However, a marked reduction in the activity of the mutated proteins was observed at the non-permissive temperature of 39\u00b0C. Thus, Pro39 proteins carrying the ts mutations display temperature sensitivity in vitro that correlates with the effects of higher temperatures observed in vivo, suggesting that an impaired protease domain is most likely responsible for the viral ts phenotypes. It is important to note that after a short exposure to 39\u00b0C the cleavage efficiency of Pro39 did not revert to the initial 28\u00b0C level (Fig. 2C) , indicating that there was a loss in the amount of active enzyme. Therefore, the ts mutations affected rather protein stability than the catalytic activity itself, although we cannot exclude that both change at higher temperatures.",

Our present results, based on in vitro analysis of the purified protease domain activity, confirmed that, in the case of SFV, Cys 478 and His 548 are essential for the proteolytic activity. Similarly, the mutation N609D in the SIN polyprotein resulted in impaired polyprotein processing [29] , which correlates with the reduced proteolytic activity of the corresponding N605D mutant of SFV Pro39. However, an interesting difference was noticed in the case of the Pro39 N605D mutation.

Here we suggest that this Trp residue is crucial because of its role in recognition of the penultimate Gly residue in the processing sites of the non-structural polyprotein. Indeed, the papain-like proteinases are known to be very specific for the amino acid residue at the P2 position of the substrate, usually a bulky or hydrophobic residue [17] . However, the non-structural polyproteins of alphaviruses have Gly preserved at this position [30] . This difference may provide the most straightforward explanation for the resistance of the SFV protease to the E-64 inhibitor [15] . The E-64 leucine moiety mimics the most common occupant of the substrate pocket of the papain-like peptidases (see [41] for papain family and [42] for calpains), but, most probably, it cannot fit the pocket arranged for a tiny Gly residue.",

In this case, however, the Glu-Ala peptide, linked together via the glutamate side chain carboxyl group, is very similar to the conventional Gly-Ala and can fit also in a small substrate pocket. The structures available for these peptidases showed the same active site architecture and the same position of the aromatic residue of the motif directly interacting with the substrate P2 Gly. There may be some variations in the active site organization since two groups of GSM proteases cleave the substrates with Gly at P1 position instead of P2 (see Table 1 ). We assume that in those cases, either another residue is allowed at P2 or the Gly at P1 plays a similar role in the recognition event. It should be noted, however, that the Rubella virus protease has been shown to be resistant to E-64, a property seemingly common to all the peptidases in the GSM group.",
