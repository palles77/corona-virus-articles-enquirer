After lung infection, the virus may enter the blood, accumulate in kidney and cause damage to resident renal cells. Indeed, COVID-19 RNA was found in the plasma of 15% of patients by real-time polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). 4 Of note, it is reported showed that 6.7% of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) developed acute kidney injury (AKI), and the mortality of those with AKI was 91.7%. 5 Thus, understanding how the kidney is affected by SARS-CoV-2 is urgently warranted.",

Such patients have a pro-inflammatory state with functional defects in innate and adaptive immune cell populations 8 , and are known to have a higher risk for upper respiratory tract infection 9 and pneumonia. 10 Of note, the median time period between the first symptoms and signs of COVID-19 and hospital admission was slightly more than a week in our study. An alternative explanation is that many COVID-19 patients could not be admitted in the very early stage of disease outbreak because of the acutely increasing, large number of patients and limited availability of hospital beds in Wuhan. Earlier admission to hospital might have helped to prevent disease spread and deterioration. This is the first study showing an association between kidney involvement and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. We found that patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine were more likely to be admitted to ICU and to undergo mechanical ventilation, suggesting that kidney disease on admission represented a higher risk of deterioration. It has been reported previously that kidney injury was associated with an increased risk of death in patients with H1N1 and SARS. 5, 11 In our study, indicators of kidney involvement at admission were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death even after adjustment for potential confounders. This AKI results from an abrupt loss of kidney function, strongly associated with increased mortality and morbidity. 12 We found that patients with elevated serum creatinine were more likely to develop AKI during hospitalization, which is consistent with study in SARS. 5 It is therefore important to increase the awareness of AKI in those who entered the hospital with an elevated serum creatinine. In our cohort the detection rate of AKI in COVID-19 patients was 5.1%, in keeping with recent reports of small sample size 1, 4, 7, 13 and much higher than the 0.5% of a large observational study. 14 This may be explained by an extremely high proportion of severely sick patients in a previous case series and only 15.7% in the large observational study. In our cohort study, 42.7% patients were severely ill, and this may explain the higher detection rate of AKI in clinic practice in Wuhan. Importantly, the present method of detecting AKI is mainly based on acute changes in serum creatinine and the frequency of serum creatinine tests has a substantial impact on detection rate. 15 In a nationwide cross-sectional survey of hospitalize adult patients in China, the detection rate of AKI was only 0.99% by KDIGO criteria. 16 After adjusting for the frequency of serum creatinine, determinations the incidence of AKI in Chinese hospitalized adults rose to 11.6%. 17 Thus, in order to improve early detection of kidney injury, more frequent serum creatinine measurements should be performed in patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "The etiology of kidney disease involvement in COVID-19 patients is likely to be multifactorial. First, the novel coronavirus may exert direct cytopathic effects on kidney tissue. This is supported by the detection of PCR fragments of coronavirus in blood and urine in 2003 SARS 18 and COVID-19 patients. 4 Recently, it has been shown that the novel coronavirus uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as a cell entry receptor, which is identical to that of the SARS-CoV as reported in 2003. 19 Recent human tissue RNA-seq data demonstrated thatACE2 expression in urinary organs (kidney) was nearly 100-fold higher than in respiratory organs (lung). 20 Therefore, the kidney disease may be caused by coronavirus entering kidney cells through an ACE2 dependent pathway. Second, deposition of immune complexes of viral antigen or virus-induced specific immunological effector mechanisms (specific T lymphocyte or antibody) may damage the kidney. However, kidney microscopy specimens from SARS patients were reported to show a normal glomerular aspect and absence of electron-dense deposits. 5 This is not in support of an active immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. Clearly, potential pathological kidney changes in COVID-19 patients require further study. Third, virus-induced cytokines or mediators might exert indirect effects on renal tissue, such as hypoxia, shock, and rhabdomyolysis. In fact, some of the 2009 H1N1 patients had mild to moderate elevations of serum creatine kinase. 21 In keeping with this observation, 138 patients with COVID-19 disease, who were admitted in ICU, showed a tendency towards increased creatine kinase levels, 13 and the patients with kidney involvement in our study tended to have increased creatine kinase levels as well.",

We found that patients with AKI were more likely to have higher proportion of glucocorticoid and lower proportion of antiviral drugs and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors treatment on admission. The difference in the use of glucocorticoid may be explained by the condition of patients with AKI that was more severe , thus physicians tended to use glucocorticoid in the most critically ill patients, even if there is a controversy on the use of glucocorticoid in COVID-19 patients. 22, 23 However, the oral antiviral drugs, including arbidol (umifenovir), oseltamivir, lopinavir and ritonavir, were preferred in moderate patients on admission. Given that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the safety and potential effects of RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 should be carefully considered. 24 Even though this study included a large number of patients from a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, it has several limitations. First, an accurate baseline serum creatinine was not available, which may have led to an underestimation of AKI or erroneous associations.

As of February 29th, Chinese health authorities announced that 79,389 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection and 2,838 death cases had been reported in 31 provincial-level regions. Of note, in Wuhan, 48,557 COVID-19 cases with 2,169 deaths were confirmed on that same day, suggesting a much higher proportion of severe cases and mortality rate in Wuhan than in other provinces of China.
