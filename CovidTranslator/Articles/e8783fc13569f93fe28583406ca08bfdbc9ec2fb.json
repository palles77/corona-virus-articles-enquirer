The graft remained in its original position in all animals, without evidence of incrustation or infection (Fig. 4) , whereas the polyethylene tube migrated to the distal ureter. For this reason, gross examination of all surgical specimens revealed varying degrees of hydroureteronephrosis to the level of the graft. There was no evidence of postoperative urinary leakage in any of the animals at death. Histologic examination of all graft-regenerated ureters showed step-by-step regeneration of urothelium and smooth muscle fibers (Fig. 5) . At 4 days, the graft showed an infiltration of erythrocytes and mononuclear cells, and the urothelial lining appeared to begin to bridge the matrix graft. At 10 weeks, the graft was composed of several layers of urothelium and some capillaries, and characteristic arrangements of smooth muscle fibers (Fig. 6) were first observed. The number of vascular elements (capillaries) had increased. At 12 weeks, nerve regeneration was first detected by PGP 95positive staining (Fig. 7) .

The thickness of these muscle bundles seemed to decrease in the central part of the graft. There was no sign of degenerative change such as calcification or necrosis of the smooth muscle layer. The urothelial lining, differentiated muscularization, and surrounding fibrous adventitia appeared qualitatively similar to normal ureteral wall components (see below).
