Methods Between 12 January and 5 March 2009, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 55 intensive care unit (ICU) patients and 41 medical personnel at 16 different time-points and tested for 11 respiratory viruses by single real-time PCR using TaqMan or MGB probes. Results Among the 55 ICU patients tested, there were 30 virus-positive respiratory specimens (30/173, 17.3%) and 23 patients who tested positive at least once for respiratory viruses (23/55, 41.8%). Only the time from admission to the ICU was associated with the probability of testing positive, with the probability of testing positive decreasing with increasing length of stay (P \\ 0.001). Of the 418 respiratory specimens collected from the healthcare personnel, 27 (6.5%) tested positive. Seventeen employees tested positive at least once for respiratory viruses (17/41, 41.5%). Among the employees, calendar time (P = 0.03) and having sick contacts at home (P = 0.006) were significantly associated with swab positivity. Among the study population, patients had a significantly higher probability of having a positive swab result than employees. The distribution of viruses differed between the two groups. Conclusions Our results suggest that when hygiene precautions are adopted, the possibility of transmitting selected respiratory viruses between patients and personnel is limited. They also point to a greater importance of the community over the hospital environment for acquisition of viral respiratory infections by ICU patients and employees.",

Tubes with swabs were vigorously vortexed for 30 s, and 200-ll samples were used for extraction. Nucleic acids were eluted in 100 ll of elution buffer. Plasma was separated from the cell fraction of the blood and stored at -80\u00b0C for eventual further processing. All respiratory samples were tested by single real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for each virus by using TaqMan or MGB probes as described previously [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The following respiratory viruses were tested: influenza (INFV) A and B, parainfluenza type 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strain A and B, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus (RV), human bocavirus (HBoV), adenovirus, and coronavirus (CoV), including the HKU1, NL63, OC43, and 229E subtypes. For all patients with at least one nasopharyngeal swab sample testing positive for viral particles, we performed PCR analysis for the detection of the corresponding viruses in plasma specimens, which were obtained concomitantly with the first positive respiratory sample.",

The exact proportion of asymptomatic patients was impossible to determine accurately. Because of the poor general health condition of the ICU patients, we only assessed lower respiratory tract infection in the patient cohort, which might has resulted in an overestimation of the proportion of asymptomatic infections.

This difference may be due to gender differences in reporting symptoms as another study found that males were significantly more likely to ''overrate'' common cold symptoms than females [18] . The vaccination rate among employees was comparable to that against the 2009 pandemic INFV A virus among healthcare workers reported by Poeppl et al. [19] . Although INFV was not detected among our ICU personnel, vaccinated employees were less likely to be symptomatic than unvaccinated ones. This may point to some kind of difference in the general attitude to healthrelated issues that includes not only an inclination toward being vaccinated but also a tendency for practicing other protective measures. Sabetta [20] . Among our employees, a higher proportion (24/41; 58.5%) of participants developed acute respiratory tract infection during a much shorter time period (8 weeks), but the ratio of virus-positive symptomatic episodes was substantially smaller (8/59, 13.6%). A partial explanation for the latter distinction might be that in our study the timing of swab collection was predetermined and not always concomitant with the beginning of respiratory symptoms, when viral load is supposedly at its peak [21] . As only selected viruses known to cause respiratory symptoms were tested in our study, acute respiratory symptoms in virus-negative employees may have been caused by other viruses or micro-organisms. In only six of the 17 (35.3%) employees (8/27 = 29.6% of samples) were virus-positive nasopharyngeal specimens accompanied with concomitant acute respiratory symptoms at at least one of the study time-points. These results are in accordance with previous reports that virus detection does not necessarily mean viral disease [22] . Even if we considered recent or near future symptoms as being related to positive swab results, the proportion of symptomatic employees (9/17 = 52.9%) or swabs (11/30 = 36.7%) was lower than that reported by Nokso-Koivisto et al. who found that in most cases (87%) rhino-and enteroviral RNA detection in the nasopharynx of children could be linked to concurrent, past, or near future respiratory symptoms [23] . Similarly, Falsey et al. found that only 11% of RSV A and 95% CI 95% Confidence interval for odds ratio, P P value obtained using a likelihood ratio test The estimated parameters are not reported because they are not meaningful, but the estimated shape of the relationship between calendar time and probability of test positivity is represented graphically for models (1) and (2) 9% of INFV A infections were asymptomatic in healthy elderly and high-risk adults [3] . We suggest that the higher proportion of asymptomatic infections in our employee cohort may be due to the fact that in the cited studies different populations of patients were evaluated, while our employee cohort comprised healthy adults, among whom only 3/41 (7.3%) were on sick leave during the study period because of acute respiratory symptoms and none was hospitalized. Another possible explanation for the higher asymptomatic rate among our employee cohort could be immunity due to frequent healthcare-related exposure to respiratory viruses. A higher immunity resulting from previous infections or vaccinations may also be an explanation for the finding that older employees in our study cohort were less often virus-positive. When only virus-positive employees were considered, we found that employees with acute respiratory symptoms had a higher viral load than asymptomatic employees; however, we did not perform a formal statistical analysis of this association due to the small number of virus-positive swabs.",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study which has simultaneously evaluated the frequency of multiple respiratory viruses in patients and employees in an ICU setting. Despite the implementation of strict hygiene precautions in our ICU we had expected the spread of respiratory viruses within ICU to be the major outcome of our study. However, our results indicate only a limited possibility of virus transmission between the two groups, which is quite the opposite to their greater risk for nosocomial transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [24] . Our comparison of findings in patients and employees revealed that the distribution of the tested viruses differed noticably between the two groups ( Fig. 1 ; Table 2 ). INFV A was present in one-fifth of patients, but there was not a single case of this infection among employees, despite the fact that less than half of the employees had been vaccinated against it. In contrast to INFV A, RSV A was predominantly isolated from employees, while CoV was evenly distributed in both the patient and employee cohorts. We can conclude with certainty that, during the study period, INFV A (zero INFV A cases among employees) and RSV A (21 days between RSV A case in patients and first RSV A case in employees) were not transmitted from patients to employees or vice versa. We can only speculate on the transmission of CoV. The detection of the first CoV case in patients and subsequently in employees suggests transmission from patients to employees. When the estimated median incubation period of human CoV, i.e., 3.2 days [25] , and the absence of sick household contacts in the first two CoV cases among employees are taken into account, this mode of transmission seems even more likely. However, a strong association between the presence of sick contacts at home and being virus-positive indicates that in employees, the risk of community infection was higher than the risk of workrelated infection. In patients, the probability of testing positive decreased with the length of the ICU stay, which again points to a greater importance of the community over the hospital environment for acquisition of viral respiratory infections. In addition, in both patients and employees, the estimated effect of calendar time on the probability of virus positivity was very consistent with data on the frequency of influenza-like illness in the general population. Although this association was not statistically significant in the patient group, presumably due to the limited sample size in our study, it further supports the concept of the predominant influence of community over the nosocomial environment for respiratory viral infections.",
