Practically, prerequisites for the diagnosis of SARS include the presence of an epidemiological linkage, rapidly progressive pneumonia resistant to standard treatment, clinical features, and virological evidence of SARS-CoV infection. An epidemiological link, defined as a history of contact with a SARS patient or visiting a hospital with nosocomial SARS outbreak, in the 10 days preceding disease onset, is useful even for patients in areas with outbreaks. Virtually all patients deteriorate despite potent antibiotic therapy , and most have lymphopenia and raised transaminase levels.",

            "text": "Theoretically, none of the manifestations of SARS would occur if an efficacious antiviral agent is given at disease onset. However, agents of proven efficacy are not available despite prolific suggestions. Apart from administering empirical antibiotic therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia, controlled clinical trials should be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of potential antiviral and immunomodulating agents. Clinical experience is only available on a few agents used in the 2003 outbreak, namely ribavirin, ritonavir/lopinavir, interferons, corticosteroids, immunoglobulin, and convalescence serum. Historically, and before SARS was even defined by the WHO, patients were treated with a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, namely ribavirin, and corticosteroid. About 60% of patients dropped their hemoglobin by 2 g dl \u00c01 after treatment with ribavirin (1.2 g tid) for 2 weeks, and higher doses were associated with elevated liver transaminase levels and bradycardia (Booth et al., 2003) . The rapid recovery of the first few Hong Kong patients had led to the adoption of the above as standard anti-SARS regimen in Hong Kong and elsewhere in 2003. Ribavirin is now considered to be ineffective. The efficacy of other possible anti-SARS-CoV agents such as antiproteases like Kaletra (ritonavir 400 mg and lopinavir 100 mg for 14 days), in combination with ribavirin as initial treatment, was associated with reduction in mortality (2.3% vs 15.6%) and intubation rate (0% vs 11%) when compared with historical controls (Chu et al., 2004 ). It appears, therefore, that ritonavir/lopinavir could be considered for early treatment of SARS patients, preferably in a controlled clinical trial setting. Adverse reactions are not infrequent and include severe pancreatitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, asthenia, headache, nausea, insomnia, and skin rash. Interferon b-1b, a-n1, and a-n3 and human leukocyte interferon a exhibit complete inhibition of cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV in vitro. SARS patients treated with corticosteroids and interferon alfacon-1 had less ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death than their counterparts (Loutfy et al., 2003) .",

Despite skepticism, immunomodulating drugs could be considered as rescue therapy. Patients who had pulse steroid therapy (e.g., methylprednisolone 250-500 mg daily for 3-5 days) did not have higher cumulative steroid dosage or side effects, but had less oxygen requirement and better radiographic outcome, than their counterparts . Although a retrospective analysis showed a higher 30-day mortality among patients who had pulse methylprednisolone, this could be due to the higher likelihood of using such therapy in more severe SARS cases. Corticosteroids are effective anti-inflammatory agents that significantly reduce interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and IFN-g inducible protein-10 levels in SARS . The use of high-dose steroids was associated with sepsis, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia, and even systemic fungal infection. Approximately 15% of SARS patients had MRI-proven avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hips and knees (Griffith et al., 2005) , which could be steroid-induced, but this incidence seems much higher than that among recipients of organ transplants despite similar steroid dosages.",

An air exchange rate of 12 times per hour and a temperature of 20 C appeared desirable, as the wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE) by staff could be too warm at times. Personal protective equipment should be provided to trained staff including the use of full-body gowns and high-specification masks (such as N95 masks). All staff are required to follow strict and stepwise 'gowning' and 'degowning' procedures. Strict personal hygiene and common sense are important. Diluted bleach is used to wipe all work surfaces and the floor every hour or after any potential contamination.
