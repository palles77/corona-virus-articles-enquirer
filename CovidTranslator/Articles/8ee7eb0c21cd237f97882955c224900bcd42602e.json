            "text": "Neonatal diarrhea remains the primary cause of mortality in dairy calves around the world, and optimal treatment protocols are needed. The main goals of therapy are to restore hydration and electrolyte concentrations, correct strong ion (metabolic) acidemia, and provide nutritional support. Administration of oral electrolyte solutions (OES) has long been the primary method used to treat neonatal diarrhea in humans and calves because OES are capable of addressing each of the primary goals of therapy. In calves with moderate dehydration, we hypothesized that oral electrolytes would be as good as or better than small volumes of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) fluids. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to compare the ability of a commercially available oral electrolyte solution (OES) administered alone or in combination with hypertonic saline with small volumes of IV or SC fluid therapy to resuscitate calves with diarrhea. Thirty-three Holstein calves from 5 to 14 d of age were utilized in this clinical trial. Diarrhea and dehydration were induced by adding sucrose to the milk replacer. In addition, hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone were given orally and furosemide intramuscularly. Depression status, clinical hydration scores, fecal consistency, and body weight were recorded at regular intervals. Treatment began when calves had severe diarrhea and had a decrease in plasma volume of at least 10%. Calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups of 8 to 9 calves per group: (1) OES; (2) OES with hypertonic saline (4 mL/kg, IV); (3) IV fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L); or (4) SC fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L). Treatments were given at 0 and 12 h. Changes in plasma volume, blood pH, electrolyte levels, and physical examination scores were determined before therapy and again at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after each treatment. All 4 treatments were ultimately successful in improving hydration as well as increasing blood pH; however, animals in both groups that received OES had much faster resuscitation than those in either the IV or SC fluid group. In conclusion, oral electrolyte products remain the gold standard for resuscitating diarrheic calves with moderate dehydration and acidemia and will likely perform better than small volumes of IV lactated Ringer's solution. Subcutaneous fluids by themselves are a poor treatment option and should be only be used as supportive therapy following the initial correction of hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis.",

Oral electrolyte solutions are preferred as treatment by producers because they are inexpensive, easy to administer on-farm, provide an easy way to administer large amounts of fluid, and have good efficacy for animals that still have a partially functional gastrointestinal tract. Yet, there is a large diversity of products and product quality on the market that may influence the success of electrolyte therapy, leading to confusion when evaluating treatment success (Smith, 2009 (Smith, , 2017 . For example, some products have very low sodium concentrations, whereas others have no alka-linizing agent (buffer) to correct acidemia. Therefore, some producers may have the impression that OES are not consistently effective in treating calf diarrhea because they are using a poor quality product.",

Lactated Ringer's solution (LRS) is a common isotonic solution administered IV or SC in calves to correct dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities associated with neonatal diarrhea. This solution is considered a weak alkalinizing fluid because the lactate is eventually metabolized to bicarbonate in the liver, which helps increase blood pH. However, the ability of lactate to produce an alkalinizing effect is considered weak or slow due to the metabolism requirement and it is not recommended for calves with severe acidemia (Kasari and Naylor, 1985) . Although LRS has shown success in correcting dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities in calves, some disadvantages are noted. These include the requirement of IV catheter placement, special equipment for administration, animal restraint, a large amount of fluids to deliver, and the need to monitor the animal during administration (Berchtold, 2009) .",

A negative energy balance and loss of BW are common findings in calves with diarrhea because of a reduction in energy intake and decreased absorption of nutrients by the gut. Severe hypoglycemia has also been associated with an increased risk of mortality in calves with diarrhea (Trefz et al., 2016 .

For example, calves weighed about 40 kg in this study at the time of initial treatment and had roughly a 19% decrease in plasma volume. Therefore, these calves would need at least 7.5 L (40 \u00d7 0.19) of fluids just to correct their deficit (not accounting for ongoing losses from continued diarrhea). If we had given a greater volume of LRS IV, we might have seen better results. However, we elected to give 2 L of IV fluids to more closely mimic what is done in most field scenarios, although previous studies comparing higher volumes of IV LRS with OES+HSS have shown similar results. In one study, a group of calves were given 80 mL/kg of LRS for the first hour followed by 4 mL/kg per hour for an additional 7 h (Walker et al., 1998b) . For a 40-kg calf, this would be approximately 5.5 L of IV LRS given over an 8-h period. Calves treated with OES+HSS in this study had more significant increases in plasma volume that were sustained for a significantly longer period compared with the group receiving the 8-h infusion of LRS. A recent study gave IV LRS at the rate of 30 mL/kg per hour for 3 h (about 3.6 L total for a 40-kg calf) to a group of calves with naturally occurring diarrhea (Aydogdu et al., 2018) . A second group of calves received the same rate of acetated Ringer's and a third group received 4 mL/kg of OES+HSS. Significant increases in plasma volume were noted in the OES+HSS group within 30 min of treatment but not in the other 2 groups. As seen in the study by Walker et al. (1998b) , the OES+HSS group had a more significant and sustained increase in plasma volume than either group that received IV fluids. Because of different sampling times in this study, we were not able to see the increase in plasma volume at 30 min post-infusion; however, we noticed a similar effect on plasma volume in the OES+HSS and IV fluid groups at 1 h post-treatment (1 and 13 h).",

In small animal species, SC fluids are commonly used in mildly dehydrated patients (Smith and Greer, 2016) or as supportive therapy in cases of chronic renal disease (Cooley et al., 2018) . Recommendations are to not use SC fluids in hypovolemic patients because of the limited absorption associated with peripheral vasoconstriction. As in other species, dehydration in calves in this study showed slow and progressive improvement after SC fluid therapy. However, the effects on acid-base status and electrolyte concentrations were minimal until 16 to 20 h into the study period. The data from this study indicate that small volumes of SC fluids should not be used as the sole treatment for rapid correction of dehydration and metabolic acidosis in calves with diarrhea. The osmotic diarrhea model utilized in this study was modified slightly from previously published models. The original model included adding sucrose to the milk replacer at 2 g per kg of BW along with the use of furosemide (2 mg/kg, IM, every 6 h), spironolactone (1 mg/kg, PO, every 8 h), and hydrochlorothiazide (1 mg/kg, PO, every 8 h). This model is extremely effective in inducing severe diarrhea (Walker et al., 1998a) and has been used in multiple studies evaluating fluid resuscitation in calves with diarrhea (Constable et al., 1996; Walker et al., 1998b) . Although this model is very effective in producing profound dehydration, calves do not typically develop a significant metabolic acidosis. A more recent study increased the dose of sucrose to 4 mg/kg, increased the dose of both spironolactone (2 mg/kg, PO, every 8 h) and hydrochlorothiazide (2 mg/ kg, PO, every 8 h), but eliminated the use of furosemide (Leal et al., 2012) . The newer model was effective in producing dehydration but calves also had moderate acidosis at the time treatment was started (blood pH Figure 3 . Change in base excess concentration following first and second treatments in calves with osmotic diarrhea. Treatment OES = oral electrolytes (n = 9); IV = intravenous fluids (n = 8); SC = subcutaneous fluids (n = 8); OES+HSS = oral electrolytes and hypertonic saline (7.2%) (n = 8). Data points with different uppercase letters (A-C) differ significantly between treatment groups; data points with different lowercase letters (a-f) differ significantly between experimental time points (P < 0.05). Error bars indicate SE. induced potassium control mechanisms. According to their findings, even if aldosterone is markedly elevated in hyperkalemic calves with diarrhea, renal excretion of potassium is not sufficient to counterbalance the systemic increase caused by severe hypovolemia. In addition, elevated levels of d-lactate may also help prevent hyperkalemia (Trefz et al., 2013b) . Although d-lactate concentrations were not measured in this study, they were likely not significantly elevated because the acidosis seen in this study was not severe. The hypovolemia observed in this study likely explains the higher levels of potassium seen at the time of initial treatment. The elevated potassium concentrations decreased with all treatments over time but decreased the fastest (but not significantly faster) with OES or OES+HSS.",

            "text": "A potential limitation of this study is that it used an experimental model of osmotic diarrhea instead of calves with naturally occurring diarrhea. Although this protocol has been used extensively in previous studies to examine different approaches for fluid resuscitation in diarrheic calves (Constable et al., 1996; Walker et al., 1998a,b; Leal et al., 2012) , it could be argued that it does not reproduce the exact metabolic alterations that are seen in some calves with diarrhea. In many acquired cases of neonatal diarrhea, calves have hyponatremia, elevated levels of d-lactate, and an elevated AG (Trefz et al., 2015) . Although d-lactate was not measured in this study, sodium levels were within the normal range and calves had a relatively mild acidemia overall compared with most calves with severe dehydration in the field. Therefore, this model might induce a more significant dehydration than it does severity of acidemia. However, previous studies have demonstrated no relationship between the severity of acidosis and the degree of dehydration (Naylor, 1987; Grove-White and White, 1993) . It should be emphasized, however, that calves with more severe acidosis need IV sodium bicarbonate (Trefz et al., 2012; Smith and Berchtold, 2014) . Clinically, this is often defined as a blood pH of <7.20 or a calf that is unable to stand during physical examination. These calves are unlikely to benefit solely from OES.",

As outlined in Table  1 , they have different sodium, chloride, potassium, glucose, and buffer concentrations along with varying strong ion differences and osmolalities. Although the treatments varied, they were chosen to represent common treatments given to calves with diarrhea in North America. The primary purpose of this study was to compare 4 very commonly administered treatments that are used in the field, not to ensure each treatment was equivalent in terms of sodium concentration, and so on. Certainly this approach leads to limitations in terms of interpreting the data. For example, both groups of calves that received OES had much greater increases in plasma glucose concentrations than calves that received small volumes of IV or SC LRS. However, if additional dextrose had been added to the LRS solutions, the results would have likely been very different. Therefore, it should not be assumed that OES is always superior to IV fluid therapy; our conclusions should only be extended to the treatment groups utilized in this study (small volumes of LRS given IV or SC).",

We originally began with that model but the first group of calves had very high blood sodium concentrations (175 to 189 mEq/L) along with clinical signs of hypernatremia. Ultimately, these calves had to be removed from the study, and we elected to decrease the sucrose dose to avoid high sodium levels. The previous study (Leal et al., 2012) fed calves whole milk, whereas we used milk replacer in this study. Whole milk is typically low in sodium, averaging about 17 to 28 mmol/L, although this may increase to 35 to 45 mmol/L in late gestation or in cows with mastitis (Gaucheron, 2005) . In contrast, many milk replacer products have significantly higher sodium concentrations than whole milk. The sodium concentration of the milk replacer used in this study (as mixed) was 88 mEq/L, likely making calves more susceptible to hypernatremia than those in the study by Leal et al. (2012) . Sucrose doses of 4 mg/kg can be used in future studies; however, it is likely necessary to use whole milk or milk replacers with lower sodium levels to avoid salt toxicity. However, by lowering the sucrose dose slightly and adding lower doses of furosemide, we were able to produce a model of osmotic diarrhea that still produced moderate acidosis.Serum potassium levels at the time of initial treatment were elevated above the normal range in all calves in this study. In one study looking at 124 calves with diarrhea, 34% had hyperkalemia (serum potassium concentration >5.8 mEq/L) at the time of initial treatment (Trefz et al., 2013a) . In a larger study of 832 calves presenting to a university teaching hospital for diarrhea, 28% had elevated serum potassium levels (Trefz et al., 2013b) . In the study by Trefz et al. (2013b) , hyperkalemia was primarily associated with dehydration and not necessarily whether the calves had an acidemia or not. The increase in potassium concentrations in our study was likely not due to furosemide administration, because this drug should increase potassium excretion by the nephron. Furosemide is a loop diuretic and is known to act on the Na-K-2Cl transport protein to reduce reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride (Roush et al., 2014) . concluded that hyperkalemia is highly dependent on the degree of dehydration, which acts directly on aldosterone- Figure 4 .

Data points with different uppercase letters (A-C) differ significantly between treatment groups; data points with different lowercase letters (a-f) differ significantly between experimental time points (P < 0.05).
