The techniques in this unit also describe how to prepare the mouse for surgery by performing a laminectomy to expose the spinal cord for transplantation. Here we show NPCs genetically labeled with eGFP transplanted into the spinal cord of a mouse following viralmediated demyelination can efficiently be detected via eGFP expression. Transplantation of these cells into the spinal cord is an efficacious way to determine their effects in neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and spinal cord injury.",

Prior to human transplantation, the functionality, efficacy, and the recipient's ability to tolerate these cells need to be tested in animal models of disease. We have shown that syngeneic mouse NPCs transplanted intraspinally into mice following viral-mediated demyelination are well tolerated and result in recovery of motor skills associated with extensive remyelination Totoiu et al 2004) . In contrast, allogeneic NPCs are rapidly rejected under the same transplant conditions, confirming the antigenicity of these cells and indicating that immune suppression to prevent rejection must be considered to ensure longterm survival (Weinger et al 2012) . We are currently testing the therapeutic effects of intraspinal transplantation of human NPCs (hNPCs) using a model of viral-induced demyelination (Buchmeier and Lane, 1999; Lane et al., 2006; Lane and Hosking, 2010) . This unit provides a method for preparing both mNPCs and hNPCs for intraspinal transplantation (Basic Protocol 1 and Alternate Protocol 1) that includes a test for hNPC multipotency (Support Protocol 1) as well as a method for preparing mice (Basic Protocol 2) and performing the transplant surgery (Basic Protocol 3).",

Alternatively, hNPCs can be derived from patient fibroblasts (Yu et al., 2007) . Below, this protocol describes the seeding and subsequent isolation of hNPCs from 6 well plates and their preparation for intraspinal transplantation.

Additionally, the cells should be OCT4 (POU5F1) negative; OCT4 is a pluripotency marker expressed on ESCs (Boiani and Scholer, 2005) . NPCs should also be negative for GFAP (astrocytes), PDGFRalpha (oligodendrocytes) and MAP2 (neurons), as this would indicate further differentiation and loss of multipotency (Chojnacki et al., 2011; Jacque et al., 1978; Shafit-Zagardo and Kalcheva, 1998) .",

Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that transplantation of hNPCs into mice with severe dysmyelination results in the formation of functional myelin (Uchida et al., 2012) . Moreover, Rowitch and colleagues (Gupta et al., 2012) have built upon these findings and have shown that engraftment of hNPCs into children with the rare leukodystrophy, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) results in new myelin formation. These studies add to a growing literature supporting the use of stem cells for treating diseases involving myelin damage including the human demyelinating disease MS (Reekmans et al., 2012) . Transplantation of neural progenitor cells promotes clinical recovery, axonal protection and formation of new myelin and impairs the spread of demyelination in both mouse and rat models of neuroinflammatory-mediated demyelination (Ben-Hur et al., 2003; Brustle et al., 1999) . Intraspinal transplantation has been shown to be an effective method for delivering both mNPCs and hNPCs. We have shown mNPCs efficiently migrate, proliferate, differentiate, and remyelinate following intraspinal transplantation into mice persistently infected with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) (Carbajal et al., 2010; Hardison et al., 2006; Totoiu et al., 2004) . These studies have allowed a better understanding of how location, microenvironment, and pathologic conditions influence clinical and histologic outcome of NPC transplantation.",

Transplantation of an excessively high number of dead or dying cells may skew the immune response resulting in enhanced recruitment of macrophages to remove the debris. In addition, the presence of a large number of dead cells could result in an increased inflammatory response that can be detrimental to healthy spinal cord tissue. Therefore, maintaining cell viability following dissociation from culture dishes is imperative to ensure the greatest possible experimental success. Using cold medium to quench enzymatic dissociation, centrifuging at 4\u00b0C, and keeping cells on ice offers the best short-term solution for greatest viability. If transplants are going to take more than three hours, the procedure should be split into two sessions with freshly isolated cells for each session. Optimal cell viability prior to transplant is 85% or greater; if there is an excessive number of dead cells, fresh cells should be prepared. Besides temperature, another potential cause of cell death is leaving cells in dissociation enzyme too long before quenching. During the 10 minute dissociation incubation, one can periodically view the cells under a phase-contrast microscope to see if cells are ready and at which point the flasks can be gently tapped to aid in cell dissociation.",

            "text": "Other issues that can affect transplant results occur during the preparation of the mouse and subsequent injection, including spinal cord damage and cell efflux. Damage to the spinal cord can occur during laminectomy if the micro-scissors nick the spinal cord. This usually occurs when sliding the micro-scissors under the lamina in order to snip the sides of the lamina. While large cuts into the spinal cord are obvious, small nicks or stabs can be visualized as red or purple mark in the spinal cord. To minimize the chance of this make sure the points of the curved micro-scissors are facing away from the cords. Also, make sure there are no sharp bone fragments left behind after cutting away the lamina as these could cause damage to the spinal cord with movement by the mouse. If micro-scissors are dull, sharp bone fragments are more likely to occur. Moreover, sharp micro-scissors allows for cleaner cuts and this reduces the necessity for excessive snipping and trimming of bone and tissue that can cause bone fragments. Cell efflux can occur as a result of injecting the cells too rapidly or removing the needle from the spinal cord too quickly. The injection and retraction speed listed in the protocol should be followed to avoid these events. It should be noted that hNPCs do not enter the tissue as readily as mNPCs and as a result tend to efflux easier. Extreme caution is needed when transplanting hNPCs that the needle is not retracted too quickly. A 30-gauge needle is described in this protocol; however, a 33-gauge needle will result in less efflux. Not all cells will be capable of passing through a 33-gauge needle without being lysed. Test your cells by running a typical cell suspension through both size needles to ensure there is no loss of cell viability.",

Coating of plates should be done 4-5 days prior to the day of transplantation and plating of cells 3#x02013;4 days prior. Preparation of cells for transplantation, including washing, counting, and resuspension takes approximately one hour.
