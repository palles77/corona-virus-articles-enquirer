However, according to the data released at February 19, 2020, the number of confirmed cases in the city of Wuhan accounts for nearly two-thirds of the entire country while the number of deaths accounts for three-quarters of the whole country, and the mortality reached a peak of over 7% at the early stage. Wuhan city, as the epidemic area, is bearing enormous public health as well as medical burdens, and the epidemic condition of the city will robustly impact on the trends of COVID-19 epidemics nation-wide as well as worldwide. Thus, an efficient and timely triage of COVID-19 patients with high mortality risk is crucial for relieving the public health burden.",

Rather than negating the diagnosis of COVID-19, the negative test results for SARS-CoV-2 are more likely to represent low sensitivity of the current RT-PCR-based assay given the similar or same clinical characteristics of the two groups of patients. Evidence highly indicated that the patients with negative results of RT-PCR assay may still have the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The poor sensitivity of the current assay could be multifactorial. The traditional RT-PCR assay has its limitations. The assay results could be influenced by specimen sources (from upper respiratory tract or lower respiratory tract) and the quality of the specimen collection. In addition, the process of virus inactivation and extraction might confer risk of viral RNA degradation in some extent and PCR inhibitors could interfere the PCR reaction, causing false-negative result.10 Therefore, we strongly believed that SARS-CoV-2 infections should not be ruled out on the patients with negative results of RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 when there are similar clinical presentations to COVID-19, especially in highly endemic area. Additionally, negative RT-PCR assay results for SARS-CoV-2 should not be used as a criterion to discharge seemingly improved patients after treatment from quarantine.Considering the false-negative SARS-CoV-2 assay results, a sensitive and specific as well as fast and convenient diagnostic method needs to be developed with urgency. At present, we are conducting another promising study on the evaluation of the antibodies (immunoglobulin [Ig] G and IgM) to SARS-CoV-2 among patients in the current cohort. It is believed that the combination of detection of the pathogen and antibodies to it would improve the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis.",
