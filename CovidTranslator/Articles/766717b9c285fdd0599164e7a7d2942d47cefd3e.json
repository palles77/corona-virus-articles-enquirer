            "text": "The lymphomas (malignant lymphoma or lymphosarcoma) are a diverse group of neoplasms that have in common their origin from lymphoreticular cells. They usually arise in lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow; however, they may arise in almost any tissue in the body. Although the annual incidence of lymphoma is difficult to predict in the absence of a national canine tumor registry, it is clear that it represents one of the most common neoplasms seen in the dog. The annual incidence has been estimated to range between 13 to 24 per 100,000 dogs at risk. [1] [2] [3] The annual incidence rates at specific ages are estimated to be 1.5 per 100,000 for dogs less than 1.0 year of age and 84 per 100,000 in the 10-to 11-year-old group. Lymphoma comprises approximately 7% to 24% of all canine neoplasia and 83% of all canine hematopoietic malignancies. 4, 5 In a review of the Veterinary Medical Data Base Program (VMDP) at Purdue University from 1987 to 1997, the frequency of canine lymphoma patients presented to 20 veterinary institutions increased from 0.75% of total case load to 2.0%, and it appears the frequency is continuing to increase. A similar trend is present in physician-based oncology; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) represents 5% of all new cancer cases, the fifth leading cause of cancer death, and the second fastest growing cancer in terms of mortality in humans. 6 Middle-aged to older (median age of 6 to 9 years) dogs are primarily affected. A decreased risk for lymphoma is reported for intact females. 7 Breeds reported to have a higher incidence include Boxers, bull mastiffs, basset hounds, St. Bernards, Scottish terriers, Airedales, and bulldogs; breeds at lower risk include dachshunds and Pomeranians. 8, 9 Etiology The etiology of canine lymphoma is likely multifactorial and largely unknown; however, investigations are currently shedding significant light on the subject.",

[10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] The publication of the canine genome and the commercial availability of canine gene microarrays (GeneChip Canine Genome 2.0 Array, Affymetrix, Inc.) have led to advances in our understanding of genetic events occurring in lymphoma. 17 Breen's group has documented gain of dog chromosomes 13 and 31 and loss of chromosome 14 as the most common aberrations in a group of 25 cases analyzed. 11 Chromosomal aberrations have also been associated with prognosis in dogs with lymphoma. A study of 61 dogs with lymphoma demonstrated a prognostic advantage in dogs with trisomy of chromosome 13 (25% of the dogs studied) as evidenced by increase in duration of first remission and overall survival time. 18 Germline and somatic genetic mutations and altered oncogene/tumor suppressor gene expression, epigenetic changes (e.g., DNA hypomethylation), signal transduction, and death-pathway alterations (e.g., Bcl-2 family) are common in human lymphomas and have been reported in the dog as well (see Chapter 1, Section A, and Chapter 14, Section B). These include N-ras, p53, Rb, and p16 cyclin-dependent kinase aberrations. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Additionally, differences in the prevalence of immunophenotypic subtypes of lymphoma among different breeds indicate heritable risks. 25 Additionally, telomerase activity (see Chapter 2) has been documented in canine lymphoma tissues.

A published hospital-based casecontrol study of dogs indicated that owners in households with dogs that develop malignant lymphoma applied 2, 4-D herbicides to their lawn and/or employed commercial lawn care companies to treat their yard more frequently than owners of dogs without lymphoma. 32 The risk of canine lymphoma was reported to rise twofold (odds ratio [OR] = 1.3) with four or more yearly owner applications of 2, 4-D. The results of this study have come under criticism, and three additional follow-up investigations have not validated assertions of increased risk. [33] [34] [35] In another study, dogs exposed to lawn treatment within 7 days of application were greater than 50 times Histopathologically, distinguishing between GI lymphoma and LPE can be difficult. Some have suggested that LPE may be a prelymphomatous change in the GI tract. A syndrome of immunoproliferative intestinal disease characterized by LPE has been described in Basenjis, which subsequently develop GI lymphoma. 49 In addition, plasma cell-rich areas with heterogeneous lymphomatous infiltration may resemble lesions of LPE. Only a few reports specifically identify the immunophenotype of the lymphocyte subpopulations in alimentary lymphoma in dogs. Historically, it was presumed that they most likely originate from B cells; however, recent evidence suggests that most GI lymphomas in dogs arise from T cells and often exhibit epitheliotropism. 48, 50 The Boxer and Shar-pei breeds may be overrepresented in cases of alimentary lymphoma. 50, 51 The mediastinal form of the disease occurs in approximately 5% of cases. 46 This form is characterized by enlargement of the cranial mediastinal lymph nodes, thymus, or both ( Figure 32 -2). Hypercalcemia is reported to occur in 10% to 40% of dogs with lymphoma and is most common with the mediastinal form. In a study of 37 dogs with lymphoma and hypercalcemia, 16 (43%) had mediastinal lymphoma. 52 The mediastinal form in dogs is most commonly associated with a T-cell phenotype. 53, 54 Cutaneous lymphoma can be solitary or more generalized and usually is classified as epitheliotropic (mycosis fungoides) or nonepitheliotropic. 55 Canine epitheliotropic cutaneous lymphoma originates from T-cells, [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] similar to its development in humans. In dogs, these more commonly represent CD8 + cells, whereas in humans they are typically CD4 + cells. A rare form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, characterized by skin involvement with evidence of peripherally circulating large (15 to 20 \u00b5m in diameter) malignant T-cells with folded, grooved nuclei, has been described. In humans, this is referred to as S\u00e9zary syndrome and has been reported in both dogs and cats. [61] [62] [63] Nonepitheliotropic cutaneous lymphomas form single or multiple dermal or subcutaneous nodules or plaques; histologically, they spare the epidermis and papillary dermis and affect the middle and deep portions of the dermis and subcutis. 55 more likely to have urine levels of 2, 4-D at 50 \u00b5g/L or higher. 36 The highest concentration was noted 2 days after application. In an environmental case-control study performed in Europe, two variables, residency in industrial areas and use of chemicals (defined as paints or solvents) by owners, modestly increased the risk of developing lymphoma; however, no link was found with pesticide use. 37 A weak association between lymphoma in dogs and exposure to strong magnetic fields was observed in a preliminary epidemiologic study. 38 In this hospital-based case-control study, the risk of developing lymphoma categorized into high or very high exposure was increased (odds ratio = 1.8). More thorough studies are necessary to evaluate this association further. Proximity to environmental waste was implicated in two European studies; however, it was felt to be a risk indicator rather than a risk factor and would require further case-control investigations. 39, 40 ",

The World Health Organization (WHO) also publishes a histologic classification scheme, which uses the revised European American lymphoma (REAL) system as a basis for defining histologic categories of hematopoietic and lymphoid tumors in domestic animals. 78 This system incorporates anatomic, histologic, and immunophenotypic criteria (B-and T-cell immunophenotype), with the goal of enabling accurate and reproducible diagnosis of specific neoplastic disease entities. This theoretically should assist in better tailoring of treatment protocols, better correlation of prognosis, and better comparative capabilities. 79, 80 ; some of the less common categories in the WHO system were not represented and are not listed. The WHO system provides accurate and consistent reproducible diagnostic results similar to the system used in human pathology; accuracy among a group of pathologists examining 300 cases was at 83% agreement, and accuracy in evaluating the six most common diagnoses (80% of the cases) was 87%. 81 Clinical studies are needed to correlate the various categories of disease with biologic behavior, response to treatment, and prognosis. Preliminary results indicate dogs with indolent lymphoma (e.g., marginal zone lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, B-or T-cell small cell lymphoma, T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma, and T zone lymphoma) maintain normal activity and appetite levels even during advanced stages of disease and experience long-term survival even with limited or no therapy. [81] [82] [83] [84] The Working Formulation (WF) was developed to allow investigators to \"translate\" among the numerous classification systems so that clinical trials could be compared in humans. Most of the larger compilations agree that most canine lymphomas are intermediate or high grade; however, diffuse immunoblastic forms appear to predominate in the United States, whereas the follicular",

However, dogs with low-grade tumors may live a long time without aggressive chemotherapy. 83, 84 Dogs with T-cell lymphomas have shown a lower rate of CR to chemotherapy and shorter remission and survival times than dogs with B-cell tumors (with the exception of lowgrade T-cell subtypes). 53, 54, 86, 88 Furthermore, T-cell lymphomas tend to be associated with hypercalcemia. 89, 90 large cell variations predominate in Europe. A comparison of European and American classifications is warranted based on this discrepancy. The WF categorizes tumors according to pattern (diffuse or follicular) and cell type (e.g., small cleaved cell, large cell, immunoblastic), but it does not include information about the immunophenotype of the tumor. 76 The WF subtypes are related to the biology of the tumor and patient survival. The updated Kiel classification includes the architectural pattern, morphology (centroblastic, centrocytic, or immunoblastic), and immunophenotype (B-cell or T-cell) of the tumor cells. 77 In both systems, the tumors can then be categorized as low-grade, intermediate grade, or highgrade malignancies. Low-grade lymphomas composed of small cells with a low mitotic rate typically progress slowly and are associated with long survival times but are ultimately incurable. Highgrade lymphomas with a high mitotic rate progress rapidly but are more likely to respond initially to chemotherapy and, in humans, are potentially curable.",

The most striking difference between canine and human lymphomas is the scarcity of follicular lymphomas in the dog. 79, 80 Some diffuse lymphomas in the dog may initially be follicular, but these may progress to the more aggressive, diffuse form by the time of diagnostic biopsy. The most common form of canine lymphoma is diffuse large-cell lymphoma, a highgrade tumor most commonly of B-cell origin. 80, 81, 85 Only a small particularly evident in dogs with hypercalcemia of malignancy. Dogs may also be presented with clinical signs related to blood dyscrasias secondary to marked tumor infiltration of bone marrow (myelophthisis) or paraneoplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia. These could include fever, sepsis, anemia, and hemorrhage. Diffuse pulmonary infiltration is seen in 27% to 34% of dogs with the multicentric form, as detected by radiographic changes (Figure 32-3) . 97 , 98 Based on bronchoalveolar lavage, the actual incidence of lung involvement may be higher. 99, 100 In the veterinary literature, 60% to 80% of canine lymphomas are of B-cell origin; T-cell lymphomas account for 10% to 38%; mixed B-and T-cell lymphomas account for as many as 22%; and null cell tumors (i.e., neither B-cell nor T-cell immunoreactive) represent fewer than 5%. 53, 54, [91] [92] [93] The development of monoclonal antibodies to detect specific markers on canine lymphocytes has made immunophenotyping of tumors in dogs routinely available in many commercial laboratories. Such techniques can be performed on paraffin-embedded samples, from tissue microarrays, on cytologic specimens obtained by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of lesions, or by flow cytometric analysis of cellular fluid samples (e.g., peripheral blood, effusions) and lesion aspirates. The Rappaport classification system, proposed in 1956 for human NHL, describes the architectural pattern (follicular or diffuse) and the cytologic features (well differentiated, poorly differentiated, or histiocytic) of lymphoma. 94, 95 This system has not proved useful in providing prognostic information or in guiding therapy in dogs with lymphoma because of the low number of follicular lymphomas in dogs, the problematic \"histiocytic\" subgroup, and the failure to account for different morphologic and immunologic cell types.",

            "text": "One criticism of the Rappaport, Kiel, and WF classification systems is that they fail to include extranodal lymphomas as a separate category. The WHO system does include anatomic location as a factor in determining certain categories. Although differences between nodal and extranodal tumors in biologic behavior and prognosis are well recognized, comparative information about the histogenesis of these tumors is lacking. For example, in humans small-cell lymphomas arising from MALT are composed of cells with a different immunophenotype than that of other small-cell lymphomas (i.e., MALT lymphomas typically are negative for both CD5 and CD10). Except for cutaneous lymphoid neoplasms, detailed characterization of extranodal lymphomas in dogs has not been done. Although cutaneous lymphoma is a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that includes an epitheliotropic form resembling mycosis fungoides and a nonepitheliotropic form, most cutaneous lymphomas have a T-cell phenotype. 64, 96 To summarize, it is important to determine the histologic grade of canine lymphomas as low (small lymphocytic or centrocytic lymphomas) or intermediate to high (diffuse large cell, centroblastic, and immunoblastic lymphomas) and the architecture as diffuse or follicular. Furthermore, determining the immunophenotype of the tumor provides useful information. Response rates to chemotherapy are, in general, better in animals with B-cell tumors and intermediate-to high-grade lymphomas. Dogs with low-grade lymphomas can have long survival times without aggressive therapy.",

Commonly, dogs are presented with respiratory distress caused by a space-occupying mass and pleural effusion, exercise intolerance, and possibly regurgitation. Additionally, dogs with mediastinal lymphoma may present with precaval A C B intravascular lymphoma usually present with signs relative to CNS, PNS, or ocular involvement. [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] These include paraparesis, ataxia, hyperesthesia, seizures, blindness, lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, polyuria, polydipsia, and intermittent fever. Finally, dogs with pure hepatosplenic lymphoma usually are presented with nonspecific signs of lethargy, inappetence, and weakness and often are icteric. 64, 65 The differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy depends on the dog's travel history (i.e., relative to infectious disease) and the size, consistency, and location of affected lymph nodes. Other causes of lymphadenopathy include infections caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites (Toxoplasma sp., Leishmania sp.), rickettsial organisms (Salmon-poisoning, Ehrlichia sp.), and fungal agents (Blastomyces and Histoplasma sp.). The potential for hypercalcemia to accompany systemic fungal diseases may further complicate differentiation from lymphoma. Discrete, hard, asymmetric lymph nodes, particularly if they are fixed to underlying tissues, may indicate metastatic tumors such as mast cell tumor or carcinoma. Immunemediated diseases (e.g., pemphigus, systemic lupus erythematosus) also may result in mild-to-moderately enlarged lymph nodes. The thickened, ulcerated, and exudative. The final stage is characterized by proliferative plaques and nodules with progressive ulceration (Figure 32-5, B) . Oral involvement may also occur and this can appear as multicentric erythematous plaque-like lesions or nodules associated with the gum and lips ( Figure 32 -5, C). Extracutaneous involvement can also occur, most often in the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and bone marrow. Nonepitheliotropic cutaneous lymphomas form single or multiple dermal or subcutaneous nodules or plaques; histologically, they spare the epidermis and papillary dermis and affect the middle and deep portions of the dermis and subcutis. 55 Dogs with primary CNS lymphoma may be presented with either multifocal or solitary involvement.

Additionally, if significant myelophthisis is present, anemia may be accompanied by thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. 112, 113 In animals with anemia or evidence of bleeding, in addition to a platelet count, a reticulocyte count and coagulation testing may be indicated. Thrombocytopenia may be seen in 30% to 50% of cases, but bleeding is seldom a clinical problem. Neutrophilia can be seen in 25% to 40% of dogs and lymphocytosis occurs in approximately 20% of affected dogs. 108 Circulating atypical lymphocytes may be indicative of bone marrow involvement and leukemia. It is important to differentiate multicentric lymphoma with bone marrow involvement (i.e., stage V disease) from primary lymphoblastic leukemia (see later), as the prognosis for each is entirely different. Hypoproteinemia is observed more frequently in animals with alimentary lymphoma. In dogs with a high total protein or evidence of an increased globulin fraction on a chemistry profile, serum proteins may be evaluated by serum electrophoresis. Monoclonal gammopathies have been reported to occur in approximately 6% of dogs with lymphoma. 114 Serum biochemical abnormalities often reflect the anatomic site involved, as well as paraneoplastic syndromes such as hypercalcemia. In cases of hypercalcemia of unknown origin, lymphoma should always be considered high on the differential disease list, and diagnostic testing directed at this possibility should be undertaken (see Chapter 5) . In addition, the presence of hypercalcemia can serve as a biomarker for response to therapy and early recurrence. Increased urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations can occur secondary to renal infiltration with tumor, hypercalcemic nephrosis, or prerenal azotemia from dehydration. Increases in liver-specific enzyme activities or bilirubin concentrations may result from hepatic parenchymal infiltration. Increased serum globulin concentrations, usually monoclonal, occur infrequently with B-cell lymphoma.",

Also, lymphoid cells are fragile, and in preparing smears of aspirated material only gentle pressure should be applied in spreading material on the slides. In most cases, a diagnosis of lymphoma can be made on evaluation of fine-needle aspirates of affected lymph nodes or other tissues. Typically, most of the cells are large lymphoid cells (>2 times the diameter of a red blood cell [RBC] or larger than neutrophils), and they may have visible nucleoli and basophilic cytoplasm (Figure 32-6 , A) or fine chromatin with indistinct nucleoli. Because tissue architecture is not maintained in cytologic specimens, effacement of the node or capsular disruption cannot be detected. Therefore marked reactive hyperplasia characterized by increased numbers of large lymphoid cells may be difficult to distinguish from lymphoma, and small cell lymphomas may have few cytologic clues that point to malignancy.

In a study of 59 dogs with lymphoma, tumor cells from six dogs were positive for both T-and B-cell markers; however, a clonality assay (see later) revealed clonality either of the T-cell or the immunoglobulin receptor but not both. This indicates that in some cases, the malignant cells may co-express B-and T-cell markers. 93 Antibodies against these molecules are used to determine the immunophenotype; however, they also have potential utility as a therapeutic modality if tumor cells could be targeted using these antibodies.",

In the authors' practice, for the typical cases of canine multicentric lymphoma, imaging is limited to thoracic Likewise, in a dog with B-cell lymphoma, the tumor cells should have identical DNA sequences in the variable region of the immunoglobulin (Ig) receptor gene. Conversely, in reactive lymphocytosis, the cells are polyclonal for their antigen receptors. Using this knowledge, investigators have used PCR technology to amplify the variable regions of the T-cell and immunoglobulin receptor genes to detect the presence of clonal lymphocyte populations in dogs (see Figure 8 -4 of Chapter 8). These techniques are reviewed in Chapter 8 and elsewhere. 150 In physician-based medicine, such assays of clonality are approximately 70% to 90% sensitive and have a false-positive rate of approximately 5%, and recent studies report similar rates in dogs. False-negative and false-positive results can occur with clonality assays. For example, cells from a dog with lymphoma may be negative for clonality if the clonal segment of DNA is not detected with the primers used, if the malignant cells are natural killer (NK) cells (rare), or if the malignant cells are present in too low a frequency to be detected. False positives occur rarely in some infectious diseases (e.g., ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease). In these cases, a diagnosis should be made only after considering the results of all the diagnostic tests, including histologic/cytologic evaluation, immunophenotyping, and clonality studies in conjunction with signalment and physical examination findings. These molecular techniques, although helpful for diagnosis, could also have utility in detecting early recurrence and in determining more accurate clinical stage and so-called \"molecular remission rates\" because they are more sensitive than standard cytologic assessment of peripheral blood, bone marrow, or lymph nodes (covered subsequently in section on treatment response).",

Diagnostic imaging and assessment of bone marrow involvement may be indicated for staging. The degree to which thorough staging is implemented depends on whether the result will alter the treatment plan, whether relevant prognostic information is gleamed, and whether the clients need to know the stage prior to initiating (or declining) a treatment plan. Additionally, when comparing different treatment protocols with respect to efficacy, consistent and similar staging diagnostics should be used to avoid so-called \"stage migration, \" which results when one staging methodology is more accurate than another. 161 The impact of stage migration on prognosis should be considered when comparing different published outcomes. radiographs as there is no prognostic difference between dogs with stage III and IV disease (i.e., liver/spleen involvement), whereas the presence of cranial mediastinal lymphadenopathy is of prognostic significance (see prognosis section). However, if there are clinical signs attributable to abdominal disease or if complete staging is necessary (e.g., for clinical trial inclusion), further imaging of the abdomen is warranted. Abdominal ultrasonography can be important for obtaining ultrasound-guided intraabdominal samples for diagnosis.

In general, combination chemotherapy protocols are superior in efficacy to single-agent protocols. Single-agent protocols result in lower response rates that are not as durable as combination chemotherapy, which is summarized in Table 11 -2 in Chapter 11.

Long-term maintenance chemotherapy has not been shown to be of significant value in humans with most forms of NHL; however, in humans, the initial induction course of chemotherapy is much more aggressive than that used in veterinary patients. Although no randomized prospective studies have been performed to address the therapeutic benefit of long-term maintenance chemotherapy in dogs, most comparisons of dogs treated with CHOP-based protocols do not show any clear advantage for a maintenance or consolidation phase after induction therapy.* Indeed, in most reports, dogs receiving shorter, less costly protocols that do not include a prolonged maintenance phase have comparable remission and progression-free survival (PFS) durations and appear to more readily achieve second remissions when they relapse following completion of chemotherapy than their counterparts receiving long-term maintenance. These data, taken together, suggest that maintenance therapy is not beneficial for most dogs with lymphoma. Until well-designed randomized prospective trials indicate otherwise, the author (DMV) prefers protocols that utilize an aggressive induction without maintenance.",

Molecular detection of MRD applies clonality and PCR techniques previously discussed in this chapter. Beyond diagnostic applications, these techniques have been applied to determine cytoreductive efficacy of various chemotherapeutic drugs and to document and predict early relapse in patients prior to more conventional methods. 215-219 Regarding biomarkers of MRD, preliminary investigations have suggested serum lactate dehydrogenase activity, 120 thymidine kinase 1 activity, 220 and serum C-reactive protein 221 may be candidates in the dog. As we become more proficient at defining MRD, the pressing clinical question becomes how we use this information. Theoretically, such information could suggest when more aggressive therapy or alternative therapy should be instituted in patients who have not achieved a \"molecular remission\" or who are undergoing early relapse; however, until we determine what these interventions should be, their clinical utility remains theoretical.",

This is a valid question; however, the answer remains elusive because adequately powered randomized controlled trials do not currently exist in the literature to show superiority for an alternate protocol in this scenario. A retrospective study of an L-asparaginase and MOPP (M, mechlorethamine; O, Oncovin; P, procarbazine; P, prednisone) protocol suggested improvement in PFS in dogs with either confirmed T-cell lymphoma or lymphoma with hypercalcemia and no immunophenotypic classification. 214 However, differences in determining PFS, response evaluation, and study population in this retrospective study did not definitively confirm superiority. 211 Further, some have advocated early inclusion of lomustine (CCNU) into protocols for treating multicentric T-cell lymphoma based on moderate success of lomustine-based rescue protocols in dogs failing CHOP. As yet, no randomized trials have documented superiority with this approach. Ultimately, superior protocol development for T-cell lymphoma awaits careful, randomized, prospective trial assessment. Until such time, the author prefers to initiate CHOP-based induction and switch to lomustinebased rescue at the first sign of progression.",

This brings veterinary outcome reporting more in line with human standards. Because the majority of dogs with lymphoma eventually experience recurrence following chemotherapy-induced remissions and because methodology for differentiating complete and partial responses is analysis dependent, PFS removes many sources of bias. Further, overall survival in published reports invariably includes patients who go on to receive varied rescue protocols that bias the overall result, making it a less comparable outcome.

Fractionated RT (to a total dose of 30 to 45 Gy) has been associated with long-term control. 270 Diffuse cutaneous lymphoma is best managed with combination chemotherapy, although the rate and durability of response is generally less than in multicentric lymphoma. The most widely used protocols for epitheliotropic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma include CCNU (60 to 70 mg/m 2 PO, every 3 weeks) along with prednisone. 271,272 Although response rates approach 80%, median remission is approximately 3 months; occasionally, durable remissions are encountered. The author has added L-asparaginase to this protocol (see Table 32 -5), and although anecdotally it appears to improve response, comparative data are not available. Sporadic reports of other therapies for cutaneous lymphoma in small numbers of cases include the use of COAP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine [Oncovin], Ara-C, and prednisone), 273 retinoic acid analogs (e.g., Accutane, etretinate), 274 L-asparaginase and pegylated L-asparaginase, 275 topical mechlorethamine (Mustargen), 276 and recombinant human \u03b1-interferon. 277 All of these reports involved small numbers of cases and resulted in limited response rates with short durations. A form of cutaneous lymphocytic infiltration has recently been characterized as an indolent T-cell lymphoma based on clonality. 131 However, surgery has been used to treat solitary lymphoma (early stage I) or solitary extranodal disease. Careful staging is necessary in such cases to rule out multicentric involvement prior to treating local disease.",

In a recent report of indolent lymphomas, four splenic lymphomas (three MZL and one MCL) underwent splenectomy alone and all survived greater than 1 year with none dying of their primary disease. 84 Splenectomy should be considered if the lymphoma is not documented in other sites following thorough staging, if lymphoma is an indolent form histologically, or if splenic rupture has occurred. Of note, no control population consisting of dogs that did not undergo splenectomy exists, so the natural history of indolent splenic lymphoma remains uncertain.",

Additionally, it has been shown that dogs with B-cell lymphomas that express lower than normal levels of B5 antigen (expressed in 95% of nonneoplastic lymphocytes) also experience shorter remission and survival durations. 54 Recently, low levels of class II MHC expression on B-cell lymphoma predicted poor outcomes. 279 Dogs presented with WHO substage b disease (i.e., clinically ill) also do poorly when compared with dogs with substage a disease. 53, 86, 91, 181, 278 Dogs with stage I and II disease have a better prognosis than those dogs in more advanced stages (stage III, IV, and V).",

German shepherd dogs and golden retrievers may be overrepresented. 137,292 Lymphocytic leukemia can occur in dogs of any age but typically occurs in middle-aged to older dogs (mean of 7 to 10 years); CLL usually occurs in older dogs (mean of 10 years). 137,280,292,293 A significant sex predilection is not reported. As with lymphoma, the etiology of lymphocytic leukemia is for the \u2022 acute (large cells with an immature cytologic phenotype). Immunophenotypic assessment using flow cytometric and molecular assays can further characterize these two major subtypes; however, some discordance exists in the veterinary literature. Three primary subtypes of CLL are reported in dogs, based primarily on immunophenotyping 137,280,293 : (1) T-CLL, which is the most common form, with cells in the majority of cases being CD8 + granular lymphocytes; (2) B-CLL, which is the next most common subtype; and (3) atypical CLL, which represents a combination of immunophenotypes (CD3 \u2212 , CD8 + ; CD3 + , CD4 \u2212 , CD8 \u2212 ; CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + ; and CD3 + + CD21 + *). This is in contrast to CLL in humans, which is primarily a disease of B-cells. In CLL, lymphocytes often are indistinguishable morphologically from normal small lymphocytes ( Figure 32 most part unknown. Genetic factors likely play a role and have been compared between dogs and humans. 16 Retroviruses have been implicated in diverse animal species such as cats, cattle, fish, snakes, birds, rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans; however, there is no proven evidence implicating a retroviral cause in dogs. In humans, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) has been associated with genetic factors and exposure to radiation, benzene, phenylbutazone, and antineoplastic agents. Extrapolation of predisposing factors across species is not warranted; in fact, etiologic factors in dogs may be quite different from those for humans given the difference in the predominant immunophenotype of the neoplastic cells (see later).",

Other differential diagnoses for lymphocytosis include infectious diseases, such as chronic ehrlichiosis, postvaccinal responses in young dogs, IL-2 administration, and transient physiologic or epinephrine-induced lymphocytosis. In some cases, reactive and neoplastic lymphocytosis are difficult to distinguish. Expansion of neoplastic lymphocytes in bone marrow is the hallmark of ALL and, in most cases, CLL. Careful examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow by an experienced cytopathologist is important in establishing a diagnosis of lymphoid leukemia; in cases of marked lymphocytosis with atypia, peripheral blood can be used for analysis of immunophenotype and clonality, and examination of bone marrow is not essential. If diagnostic bone marrow cannot be adequately obtained by aspiration, bone marrow core biopsy should be performed. In ALL, lymphoblasts predominate in the bone marrow and are also present in peripheral blood, and other lineages are decreased. In B-and T-cell CLL, the lymphocytes are small mature cells that occur in excessive numbers in bone marrow (\u226530% of all nucleated cells) early in the disease. 295 In T-CLL, lymphocytes may contain pink granules. Infiltration becomes more extensive as the disease slowly progresses, and eventually the neoplastic cells replace normal marrow.",

Most oncologists recommend active surveillance (monthly or bimonthly physical examination and CBC) over active therapy for patients when CLL is identified incidentally, there are no accompanying clinical signs, and other significant hematologic abnormalities are not identified. If the animal is significantly anemic or thrombocytopenic, is showing evidence of significant lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, or has an excessively high lymphocyte count (e.g., >60,000/\u00b5L), therapy should be instituted. The definition of \"excessively high\" varies among oncologists, and a standard has not been established in veterinary medicine. The author (DMV) prefers to base treatment decisions on the presence of significant constitutional signs and peripheral cytopenias. Currently, the most effective drug available for treatment of CLL is chlorambucil. 295 Chlorambucil is given orally at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg or 6 mg/m 2 PO once daily for 7 to 14 days; the dose can then be reduced to 0.1 mg/kg or 3 mg/m 2 PO daily. For long-term maintenance, a dose of 2.0 mg/m 2 every other day can be used. The dose is adjusted based on clinical response and bone marrow tolerance. Oral prednisone is used concurrently with chlorambucil at doses of 1 mg/kg daily for 1 to 2 weeks, then 0.5 mg/kg every other day thereafter. The addition of vincristine or the substitution of cyclophosphamide for chlorambucil has been advocated in animals that do not respond to chlorambucil. origin (CD3 + ,CD4 \u2212 , CD8 \u2212 , CD21 \u2212 ). 137 In general, these cells tend to be intermediate-sized or large cells with moderate amounts of basophilic cytoplasm. Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of lymphoblasts is the nuclear chromatin pattern, which typically is more condensed than the chromatin in myeloblasts. Lymphoblasts are larger than neutrophils, have a high nuclear : cytoplasmic ratio, and contain blue cytoplasm that in some cases is intensely basophilic (see Figure 32 -11). Nucleoli, although present, are less prominent in lymphoblasts than in myeloblasts. Nevertheless, these cells cannot be distinguished easily from blast cells of other hematopoietic lineages, and identification of lineage-specific markers by immunocytochemical or flow cytometric analysis is required to ascertain the lineage. If the cells express CD34, a stem cell marker, an acute phenotype is implied 137,280 ; however, both myeloid and lymphoid lineages express CD34, and our ability to differentiate ALL from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relies on detection of other markers, including T-and B-cell markers and myeloperoxidase, a myeloid marker.",

Several studies have documented the potential molecular means by which FeLV can result in lymphoid neoplasia (see Chapter 1, Section C). As one would predict, along with a shift away from FeLV-associated tumors came a shift away from traditional signalment and relative frequency of anatomic sites. This is also supported outside of North America by similar signalment and anatomic frequency data observed in Australia where FeLV infection is quite rare. 10, 11 The median age of approximately 11 years now reported in North America is considerably higher than the median ages of 4 to 6 years reported in the FeLV era. 1,2,5-7 The median age of cats within various anatomic tumor groupings has not changed, and anatomic forms traditionally associated with FeLV such as the mediastinal form still occur in younger, FeLV antigenemic cats. Similarly, the alimentary form occurs most often in older, FeLVnegative cats. Table 32 -8 presents an overview of the characteristics, including FeLV antigenemic status, of the various anatomic sites of lymphoma in cats. As our ability to interrogate FeLV associations on a molecular basis has improved (e.g., PCR amplification and fluorescent in-situ hybridization), several reports exist defining the role or potential role of FeLV in cats with and without FeLV antigenemia. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Collectively, these studies indicate FeLV proviral insertion exists in a significant proportion of feline lymphoma tissues and is more common in those of T-cell origin, particularly the thymic and peripheral lymph node anatomic forms. They also suggest that several common FeLV integration sites exist. There is also evidence that feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection can increase the incidence of lymphoma in cats. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] In contrast to the direct role of FeLV in tumorigenesis, most evidence available FeLV vaccines appearing in the late 1980s (see the later section on viral etiology). The decline in FeLV-associated lymphoma was mirrored by a decline in the overall prevalence per year of FeLV positivity in cats tested as characterized by reports, including the Tufts Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory from 1989 to 1997, 5, 6 and by the Louwerens group, who reported a decline in FeLV association in over 500 cases of lymphoma in cats presenting to the University of California at Davis veterinary teaching hospital. 7 In these reports, FeLV antigenicity declined to represent only 14% to 25% of cats presenting with lymphoma. Importantly, Louwerens' study revealed that despite a sharp drop in FeLV-associated lymphoma, the overall prevalence of lymphoma in cats is increasing. The increased prevalence appears due to an increase in the number and relative frequency of the alimentary (and in particular the intestinal) anatomic form of lymphoma in the species. This is supported by an epidemiologic survey of 619 cases of feline intestinal lymphoma; 534 (86%) were from the 20 years following 1985 and only 14% were from cases diagnosed in the 20 years prior to 1985. 8 The true annual incidence rate for lymphoma in cats is currently unknown. With respect to feline pediatric tumors, a study in the United Kingdom (n = 233 pathology specimens) found that 73 (31%) represented hematopoietic tumors, of which 51 (70%) were lymphoma-note that FeLV status was unavailable for this compilation of cases. 9 The typical signalment for cats with lymphoma cannot be uniformly stated as it varies widely based on anatomic site and FeLV status and therefore will be discussed individually under sitespecific discussions. In general, based on two large compilations (n = 700) of cases in North America, 5, 7 Siamese cats appear overrepresented and although a 1.5 : 1 male to female ratio was observed in one, no association with sex or neutering status was observed in the other. In a large compilation of Australian cases, male cats and the Siamese/oriental breeds were overrepresented, 10 and similar breed findings have been observed in North America, although similar sex predilections have not been found. Within the Siamese/ oriental breeds, there appears to be a predisposition for a \u2022 FeLV, Feline leukemia virus; ID, insufficient data; CNS, central nervous system.

The largest compilation of feline cases subjected to rigorous histologic classification was reported by Valli and others 48 using the NCI WF. WHO has also published a histologic classification system that uses the REAL system as a basis for defining histologic categories of hematopoietic tumors of domestic animals. 49 This system incorporates both histologic criteria and immunohistologic criteria (e.g., B-and T-cell immunophenotype). Regarding anatomic location, as discussed previously, a profound change in presentation, signalment, FeLV antigenemia, immunophenotype, and frequency of anatomic sites has occurred in cats with lymphoma in the \"post-FeLV\" era (see Table 32 -8). Because of this shift, characteristics of feline lymphoma discussed in this chapter will be primarily limited to reports collected from cases presenting after 1995. Several anatomic classifications exist for lymphoma in the cat, and some categorize the disease as mediastinal, alimentary, multicentric, nodal, leukemic, and individual extranodal forms. Others have combined various nodal and extranodal forms into categories of atypical, unclassified, and mixed, and others have combined intestinal, splenic, hepatic, and mesenteric nodal forms into one category termed intraabdominal. Some discrepancies in the discussion of frequency will inevitably result from the variations in classification used in the literature. The relative frequency of anatomic forms and their associated immunophenotype may also vary with geographic distribution and may be related to genetic and FeLV strain differences, as well as prevalence of FeLV vaccine use.",

The tumors can be solitary but more commonly diffuse throughout the intestines. Some reports limit the alimentary form to GI involvement with or without extension to the liver. Lymphoma is the most common tumor type found in the intestines of cats, representing 55% of cases in an epidemiologic survey of 1129 intestinal tumors in the species. 8 The Siamese breed is reported at increased risk. 7, 8 While lymphoma may occur in cats of any age, it is primarily a disease of aged cats with a mean age of approximately 13 years for T-cell alimentary lymphoma and 12 years for B-cell lymphoma. 7, 8, [50] [51] [52] No consistent sex bias is noted. Anatomically, alimentary lymphoma is nearly 4 times more likely to occur in the small intestine than the large intestine. 52 In a series of colonic points toward an indirect role for FIV secondary to the immunosuppressive effects of the virus. Shelton 18 determined that FIV infection alone in cats was associated with a fivefold increased risk for development of lymphoma. Coinfection with FeLV will further potentiate the development of lymphoproliferative disorders. Experimentally, cats infected with FIV have developed lymphoma in the kidney, alimentary tract, liver, and multicentric sites. FIVassociated lymphoma is more likely that of the B-cell immunophenotype rather than the T-cell predominance associated with FeLV. It has been suggested that FIV infection may be associated more commonly with alimentary lymphoma of B-cell origin, 28, 29 and this may be related to chronic dysregulation of the immune system or the activation of oncogenic pathways; however, FIV antigenemia was only rarely associated with alimentary lymphoma in other large compilations of cases. 5,30-33",

Several genetic factors have already been discussed as they relate to FeLV associations. Additionally, N-ras aberrations have been implicated, although they are rare in cats. 34 Furthermore, telomerase activity (see Chapter 2) has been documented in feline lymphoma tissues. 35, 36 Alterations in cellular proliferation and in cell-cycle and death (apoptosis) pathways, in particular the cyclin-dependent kinase cell-cycle regulators and the Bcl-2 family of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic governing molecules, have also been implicated in feline lymphoma.

Affected cats generally present with enlargement of one or two mandibular or cervical nodes initially, and tumors are immunophenotypically classified as T-cell-rich, B-cell lymphoma. One case each of inguinal node, multicentric nodal, and neoplasia in cats, lymphoma was the second most common malignancy (41%), second only to adenocarcinoma. 33 There is some discordance in the literature regarding the histologic type (primarily cell size: small versus large), immunophenotype, and architecture involved with GI lymphoma. While studies (often older or smaller reports) suggest a majority of B-cell immunophenotypes, 5,53 larger, more recent reports 51, 54, 55 indicate the majority represent mucosal low-grade T-cell immunophenotypes. Conversely, the vast majority of B-cell GI lymphomas in cats are large cells and intermediate or high grade. 51, 53 The largest compilation to date (n = 120), by Moore and others, 51 classified GI lymphomas based on immunophenotype, then as either mucosal (infiltrate confined to mucosa and lamina propria with minimal submucosal extension) or transmural (significant extension into submucosa and muscularis propria). They then compared infiltration patterns with the WHO classification scheme, 56 as well as documenting anatomic location, cell size, presence of epitheliotropism, clonality, and outcome data. This information is summarized in Table 32-9. Of the 120 cases, none tested serologically positive for FeLV and only 3 for FIV. Four cats had concurrent large B-cell lymphoma (stomach, cecum, or colon) and small T-cell lymphoma of the small intestine. Topographically, T-cell variants are much more likely to occur in the small intestine (94%) and rarely in the stomach or large intestine. Conversely, B-cell variants were often multiple and often occurred simultaneously within the stomach, small intestine, and ileocecocolic junction. The vast majority of T-cell variants were mucosal (equivalent to WHO enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma [WHO EATCL] type II), and the vast majority of B-cell tumors were transmural (equivalent to WHO EATCL type I classification). Regarding cell size, nearly all mucosal T-cell tumors were composed of small lymphocytes, and slightly more than half of transmural T-cell and all B-cell variants were composed of larger cells. Epitheliotropism is present in approximately 40% of T-cell tumors but is rare in B-cell tumors. Other abdominal organ involvement is common, and in one report of 29 cases of low-grade T-cell intestinal lymphoma, liver and mesenteric involvement was documented in 53% and 33% of cases, respectively. 57 Hepatic lymphoma can occur concurrently with GI lymphoma or be confined solely to the liver. 52, 58 Most are T-cell and clonal or oligoclonal based on PCR analysis.",

LGL is characterized by lymphoblasts described as 12 to 20 \u00b5m in diameter with a round, clefted, or cerebriform nucleus; variably distinct nucleoli; finely granular to lacey chromatin; and a moderate amount of basophilic granular cytoplasm that was occasionally vacuolated. 59 Prominent magenta or azurophilic granules are characteristic (see Figure 7 -34, Chapter 7).

These NK tumors commonly originate in the small intestine, especially the jejunum, are transmural, often exhibit epitheliotropism, and at least two-thirds present with other organs involved-most with mesenteric lymph node involvement and many with liver, spleen, kidney, peritoneal malignant effusions, and bone marrow infiltration.

In more contemporary reports, the median age at presentation is 9 years, although 6% occurred in cats under 1 year of age. 68, 69 The vast majority of cases are not associated with either FeLV or FIV. The greater median age and lack of FeLV/FIV association are in contrast to reports compiled prior to the post-FeLV era; in earlier studies, the median age was approximately 7.5 years, 25% of cases were FeLV antigenemic, and the majority constituted a B-cell immunophenotype. Little contemporary information exists on the immunohistologic classification of renal lymphoma; however, in Australia where FeLV is not a significant problem, most renal lymphoma is B-cell and intermediate to high grade. 11 Extension to the CNS is a Hodgkin's-like nodal lymphoma usually present without overt clinical signs. 65, 66 Cats with nasal lymphoma are typically presented with nasal discharge (60% to 85%), sneezing (20% to 70%), upper respiratory noise (stridor, stertor, wheezing; 20% to 60%), facial deformity (0% to 20%), anorexia (10% to 60%), epiphora (10% to 30%), and occasionally increased respiratory effort and coughing. 68, 69, 73 The nasal discharge is usually mucopurulent, although epistaxis is present in up to one-third of cases. Regional lymphadenopathy can also occur. The median duration of clinical signs prior to diagnosis is 2 months (range of 1 to 1800 days).",

The debate still rages as to whether endoscopically obtained tissue is sufficient for diagnosis or if fullthickness tissue procured during laparotomy or laparoscopy is necessary in light of similarities with IBD. 51, 54, 103, 104 As previously discussed, histologic features that help differentiate intestinal lymphoma from IBD include lymphoid infiltration of the intestinal wall beyond the mucosa, epitheliotropism (especially intraepithelial nests and plaques), heterogeneity, and nuclear size of lymphocytes. 51, 54 Although the presence of transmural involvement is highly suggestive of lymphoma, the lack of transmural infiltration is not pathognomonic for IBD; transmural infiltration is common with B-cell and large T-cell (including LGL) intestinal lymphoma but is observed in the minority of low-grade T-cell intestinal lymphomas that represent the largest group in cats (see Table 32 -9). 51 For these reasons, if the differentiation of lymphoma and IBD is equivocal after standard histopathologic assessment, the addition of immunophenotypic and PARR analysis in a stepwise fashion, as proposed by Kiupel and others, 54 may be ultimately necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Their study of 63 cats with either lymphoma or IBD found that, although standard histopathology was highly specific for diagnosis of lymphoma (99% specific, 72% sensitive), sensitivity was enhanced by the addition of immunophenotypic analysis (99% specific, 78% sensitive) and further enhanced by PARR analysis (99% specific, 83% sensitive).",

If lymphoblasts are not identified in the pleural chylous effusion, then cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations can be measured. 105 In chylous effusions, the pleural fluid triglyceride concentration will be greater than in the serum; however, anorectic cats will have lower triglyceride levels in the pleural fluid. A major differential for mediastinal lymphoma is thymoma. The cytologic features of thymoma can be distinct from lymphoma in many cases, but the diagnosis can be challenging because of a preponderance of small lymphocytes in thymoma. Mast cells can also be seen in up to 50% of aspirations from thymomas. The addition of immunophenotypic and clonality assessment may be helpful in equivocal cases.",

This is further complicated by the plethora of papers that \"lump\" very small numbers of cases representing multiple anatomic/immunophenotypic and histologic subtypes (e.g., small cell versus large cell variants) together when reporting survival analysis following chemotherapy. This provides only general observations rather than important specific outcome information (i.e., response rate and durability of response) that can vary significantly with respect to anatomic and histologic subtype. In general, canine lymphoma is most commonly intermediate-high grade and nodal, whereas cats more commonly present with GI or extranodal (\u00b1nodal extension), small cell, low-grade, and/or indolent forms. As will be discussed subsequently, the author bases most treatment decisions on assessment of whether the individual case represents a low-grade (e.g., indolent, small cell variants) versus an intermediate-or high-grade (e.g., large cell) lymphoma. Finally, much of the early work on chemotherapy protocol development for cats with lymphoma occurred during the FeLV era, and care should be exercised when applying this information in the post-FeLV era.",

Most combination induction protocols currently employed in cats are modifications of CHOP protocols initially designed for human oncologic use. 5,110-116 CHOP represents combinations of cyclophosphamide (C), doxorubicin (H, hydroxydaunorubicin), vincristine (O, Oncovin) and prednisone (P). In general, CHOPbased protocols are appropriate for cats with large cell, intermediate-and high-grade lymphoma involving any anatomic site (e.g., peripheral nodal, mediastinal, and renal forms) but should not be first-line therapy for small cell, low-grade variants. As in the dog (see Section A in this chapter), a plethora of modifications are used with CHOP-based protocols, although virtually no quality comparative data exist to compare outcomes, and as such, the protocol used should be based on cost, ease, client/veterinarian preference, and level of comfort.

Image-guided needle aspiration of epidural lesions may used in cats in Europe, and one compilation reported similar results to CHOP. 64 A COP protocol commonly employed in cats is presented in Table 32 -11. Some studies with relatively few case entries have reported limited activity for doxorubicin as a single agent in cats with lymphoma 118, 119 ; however, larger studies using combination protocols have more consistently reported the addition of doxorubicin as necessary for the attainment of more durable responses. 5, 114 Interestingly, in a report of 23 cats having relapsed following COP-based protocols (without doxorubicin), only 22% responded subsequently to doxorubicin-containing rescue therapy. 120 A small number of cats with lymphoma have been treated with single-agent oral CCNU (lomustine) at a dosage range of 30 to 60 mg/m 2 every 3 to 6 weeks. 121, 122 Whereas activity was noted, only partial responses were reported. L-asparaginase, which is often included in protocols for lymphoma in cats, has a much shorter asparagine-depleting effect in cats (lost by 7 days) than in dogs and in one study in 13 cats with lymphoma resulted in only a 30% response rate. 123 In general, cats with intermediate-and high-grade lymphoma treated with CHOP-based or COP protocols do not enjoy the same level of success as dogs.

This protocol has been used in many cats with various forms of intermediate-and high-grade lymphoma and is generally well tolerated. At present, most canine lymphoma protocols (see Section A in this chapter) discontinue chemotherapy by the 25th week, and we have sufficient data to show shorter, maintenance-free protocols are as good if not superior to longer maintenance protocols; however, similar comparative data do not exist in the cat. Until such time as evidence to the contrary exists, the author presently recommends discontinuation of chemotherapy at week 25 in cats who have attained a complete remission. Doxorubicin alone (25 mg/m 2 , every 3 weeks for 5 total treatments) or palliative prednisone therapy is offered if clients decline more aggressive CHOP-based therapy. Cats are generally less tolerant of doxorubicin than are dogs; therefore a lower dosage (25 mg/m 2 IV or 1 mg/kg IV) is used (see Chapter 11) . Cardiac toxicity does not appear to be a clinically significant problem in cats, although renal toxicity is more commonly encountered in the species 117 and renal function should be monitored (i.e., serial BUN, creatinine, and urine specific gravity) closely prior to and during therapy. The use of COP (i.e., CHOP without the addition of doxorubicin) is often \u2022 nasal cavity following thorough staging (node cytology, thoracic and abdominal imaging, bone marrow aspiration), then RT is the treatment of choice. CRs in the order of 75% to 95% are reported, with reports of median survivals following RT of 1.5 to 3 years. 73, 129 Cats that do not achieve a CR with RT have a median survival of approximately 4.5 months. Total radiation dosage does affect survival durations, and a total dose greater than 32 Gy is recommended. 73 The addition of chemotherapy has not been shown to enhance survival for cats with locally confined disease; combinations of RT and chemotherapy result in similar response rates and survival times. 73, 128, 129 Chemotherapy (COP-or CHOP-based protocols) used in the absence of RT is a reasonable alternative, with complete response rates of approximately 75% and median survivals of approximately 2 years reported for cats achieving CR. 68 The author's preference is to initiate systemic chemotherapy only for (1) cases that have confirmed disease beyond the nasal passage, (2) cases that relapsed following RT, or (3) cases in which RT is unavailable or declined.",

The classification of leukemias in cats is difficult because of the similarity of clinical and pathologic features and the transition, overlap, or mixture of cell types involved. [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] Most case-series reports are from the FeLV era and generally only single case reports exist from the more contemporary post-FeLV era, which further confuses our understanding of the biology and outcome. For this reason, only a simplistic discussion, primarily relating to the lymphoid leukemias will be presented here and the interested reader is again referred to Section C for a general discussion of nonlymphoid leukemia. For cats with suspected leukemia, peripheral blood assessment (e.g., CBC with differential, flow cytometric analysis for size and immunophenotype, and PARR [for lymphoid leukemias]), and bone marrow aspiration or biopsy may contribute to a diagnosis. The preferred sites for bone marrow aspiration are the proximal humerus or iliac crest. Cats with acute leukemia are likely to have malignant cellular infiltrates in organs other than bone marrow. 134 A bone marrow aspirate with greater than 30% abnormal blast cells is sufficient to make a diagnosis of an acute leukemia. In cats with suspected CLL, infiltration of the bone marrow with more than 20% mature lymphocytes helps confirm the diagnosis. All cats with leukemia should be tested for FeLV/FIV. Determining the lineage of some leukemias can be challenging; most can be distinguished from one another by histologic appearance, histochemical stains, or immunohistochemical or flow cytometric analysis of the leukemic cells for cellular antigens that identify their lineage (see Chapter 8 and Section C in this chapter). 131, 133, 136 In addition, examination of blast cells by electron microscopy may reveal characteristic ultrastructural features. The French-American-British (FAB) classification system is considered useful in cats with myelodysplastic syndromes and almost all will be FeLV antigenemic. 136, 137 Lymphoid Leukemia ALL was the most commonly encountered type of leukemia in cats in the FeLV era; however, it is much less common today. ALL is characterized by poorly differentiated lymphoblasts and prolymphocytes in blood and bone marrow. Approximately 60% to 80% of cats with ALL were FeLV positive, and most malignant cells have T-cell immunophenotypes 138 ; however, little information is available in the contemporary literature.",

These disorders have been classified based on biologic behavior, degree of cellular differentiation, and lineage of the neoplastic cells (granulocytic, monocytic, erythroid, megakaryocytic, or mixed). Newer classification systems in humans have incorporated genetics and molecular genetic analysis; these are currently areas of active investigation in the study of animal leukemias. 2 In 1991 the Animal Leukemia Study Group made recommendations for classifying nonlymphoid leukemias in dogs and cats. 3 More recently, the Oncology Committee of the American College of Veterinary Pathologists (ACVP) has been reexamining criteria for a classification system and spearheading large multiinstitutional studies to validate the criteria.

[22] [23] [24] In contrast to MPDs in cats, no causative viral agent has been demonstrated in dogs, although retrovirus-like budding particles were observed in the neoplastic cells of a dog with granulocytic leukemia. 25 Pathology and Natural Behavior A review of normal hematopoiesis will aid in understanding the various manifestations of MPDs. Hematopoiesis is the process of proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of stem cells into terminally differentiated blood cells. A simplified scheme is presented in Figure 32 -17. Pluripotent stem cells differentiate into either lymphopoietic or hematopoietic multipotent stem cells. 26 Under the influence of specific regulatory and microenvironmental factors, multipotent stem cells in bone marrow differentiate into progenitor cells committed to a specific hematopoietic cell line, for example, erythroid, granulocytic-monocytic, or megakaryocytic. Maturation results in the production of terminally differentiated blood cellserythrocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, and platelets-that are delivered to the circulation. In some cases, as in the maturation of reticulocytes to erythrocytes, final development may occur in the spleen.",

In humans, acquired chromosomal derangements lead to clonal overgrowth with arrested development. 15 At the end of the last century, chromosomal abnormalities were reported in dogs with AML, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and lymphoid leukemia. 16, 17 However, because karyotyping is difficult to perform in dogs because of the large number and morphologic similarity of their chromosomes and their resistance to banding, defining genetic factors in canine myeloid neoplasms has awaited application of molecular technologies and use of the canine genome map. erythropoietin is the best characterized; it regulates erythroid proliferation and differentiation and is produced in the kidney, where changes in oxygen tension are detected. The myeloid compartment depends on a group of factors, collectively referred to as colonystimulating factors (CSFs). These factors act at the level of the committed progenitor cells but also influence the functional capabilities of mature cells. Some of these factors have a broad spectrum of activity; others are more restricted in their target cells and actions. CSFs are produced in vitro by a multitude of cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells, and these cells likely play a role in the production and regulation of these factors in vivo. The gene for thrombopoietin also has been cloned, and it appears that this hormone alone can induce differentiation of megakaryocytes and platelet production. 28 Recombinant forms of many of these hormones are increasingly available.",

This syndrome has been described in cats, usually in association with FeLV infection but has only rarely been recognized in dogs. [29] [30] [31] [32] These clonal disorders may be manifested by abnormalities in any or all lineages because hematopoietic cells share a common stem cell. In addition, transformation from one form to another may occur. 33 Myeloid neoplasms are classified in several ways. The terms acute and chronic refer to the degree of cellular differentiation of the leukemic cells, but these terms also correlate with the biologic behavior of the neoplasm. 34 Disorders resulting from uncontrolled proliferation or decreased apoptosis of cells incapable of maturation lead to the accumulation of poorly differentiated or \"blast\" cells. These disorders are included under the umbrella term, acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Disorders resulting from unregulated proliferation of cells that exhibit progressive, albeit incomplete and defective, maturation lead to the accumulation of differentiated cells. These disorders are termed myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and include polycythemia vera, CML and its variants, essential thrombocythemia, and possibly primary myelofibrosis. Myeloid neoplasms are further classified by the lineage of the dominant cell type(s), defined by Romanowsky stains, special cytochemical stains, ultrastructural features, flow cytometric analysis, and immunologic cell markers, and they have been classified into subtypes (see later discussion).",

Recognition of specific subtypes of leukemia is required to compile accurate and useful information about prognosis and response to treatment, as well as to compare studies from different sites. In 1991, this group proposed a classification system following adaptation of the French-American-British (FAB) system and criteria established by the NCI Workshop. 3 Group members examined blood and bone marrow from 49 dogs and cats with myeloid neoplasms. Romanowsky-stained specimens were examined first to identify blast cells and their percentages. Lineage specificity was then determined using cytochemical markers. The percentage of blasts and the information about lineage specificity were used in combination to classify disorders as acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML, subtypes M1 to M5 and M7), and erythroleukemia with or without erythroid predominance (M6 and M6Er). A description of these subtypes is presented in Table 32-12. Canine karyotyping is difficult, but with advancements in molecular cytogenetic analysis, chromosome painting, and genomic hybridization, AML in dogs can now be analyzed at the base-pair level, 18, 19 and missense mutations in FLT3, C-KIT, and RAS sequences have been identified in dogs with AML, similar to what has been found for human AML. 36 In addition to serving as diagnostic and prognostic markers, cytogenetic lesions may be therapeutic targets. As cytogenetic abnormalities continue to be identified, this information will need to be incorporated into classification schemes.",

In any case, the result is overproduction of red blood cells (RBCs). The disease is rare and must be distinguished from more common causes of polycythemia, including relative and secondary absolute polycythemia (see later discussion). In PV, there is neoplastic proliferation of the erythroid series with terminal differentiation to RBCs. The disease has been reported in dogs that tend to be middle-aged with no breed or sex predilection [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] and is characterized by an increased RBC mass evidenced by an increased packed cell volume (PCV), RBC count, and hemoglobin concentration. The PCV is typically in the range of 65% to 85%. The bone marrow is hyperplastic, although the myeloid : erythroid (M : E) ratio tends to be normal. In contrast to the disease in humans, other cell lines do not appear to be involved, and transformation to other MPNs has not been reported. The disease in dogs may be more appropriately termed primary erythrocytosis. In humans, acquired JAK2 gene mutations are identified in 90% of patients with primary polycythemia, and recently an identical mutation in the JAK2 gene of one of five dogs with primary polycythemia was reported. 74",

            "text": "In dogs, CML is more similar to chronic neutrophilic leukemia, a rare form of MPN in humans, than to CML in humans because it is a neoplastic proliferation of the neutrophil series, although concurrent eosinophilic and basophilic differentiation can occur. CML can occur in dogs of any age. 35, [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] Neutrophils and neutrophilic precursors accumulate in bone marrow and peripheral blood as well as in other organs. The peripheral WBC count is usually, but not always, greater than 100,000/\u00b5L. Both immature and mature neutrophils are present, as demonstrated in Figure 32 -18, F. Mature forms are usually more numerous, but sometimes an \"uneven\" left shift is present. Signs of dysplasia may be evident, including hypersegmentation, ringed nuclei, and giant forms. Eosinophils and basophils may also be increased. The bone marrow is characterized by granulocytic hyperplasia, and morphologic abnormalities may not be present. Erythroid and megakaryocytic lines may be affected, resulting in anemia, thrombocytopenia, or less commonly, thrombocytosis. This disorder must be distinguished from severe neutrophilic leukocytosis and \"leukemoid reactions\" caused by inflammation or immune-mediated diseases. Leukemoid reactions can also occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome. In humans with CML, characteristic cytogenetic abnormalities are present in all bone marrow cells, signifying a lesion at the level of an early multipotent stem cell. Typically, these individuals have a chromosomal translocation, resulting in the Philadelphia chromosome or BCR-ABL translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. 80 The analogous chromosomes in dogs are chromosomes 9 and 26, and BCR-ABL mutations have now been reported in three cases of CML in dogs. 2 Variants of CML are chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and chronic monocytic leukemia (CMoL). [81] [82] [83] These diagnoses are made based on the percentage of monocytes in the leukemic cell leukemia (M4).* Megakaryoblastic leukemia (M7) also is well recognized in dogs 10,47-58 and may be associated with platelet dysfunction. 51 Monocytic leukemias have likely included those with and without monocytic differentiation (M5a and M5b), 11, 59 but in some cases the diagnosis may have been chronic myelomonocytic or chronic monocytic leukemia (see later discussion). There are few reports in dogs of spontaneously occurring erythroleukemia (M6) in which the leukemic cells include myeloblasts, monoblasts, and erythroid elements. [60] [61] [62] AULs have uncertain lineages because they are negative for all cytochemical markers. These leukemias should be distinguished from lymphoid leukemias by flow cytometric analysis of the leukemic cells for cellular antigens that identify their lineage. 63 In addition, examination of blast cells by electron microscopy may reveal characteristic ultrastructural features.",

            "text": "Dysfunction of the hematopoietic system can be manifested by a variety of abnormalities that constitute myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In dogs, in which the syndrome is rare, there usually are cytopenias in two or three lines in the peripheral blood (anemia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia). Other blood abnormalities can include macrocytic erythrocytes and metarubricytosis. The bone marrow is typically normocellular or hypercellular, and dysplastic changes are evident in several cell lines. If blast cells are present, they make up less than 30% of all nucleated cells, 2 although this threshold is being changed to less than 20%. 4, 20 Myelodysplasia is sometimes referred to as preleukemia because, in some cases, it may progress to acute leukemia. [29] [30] [31] Based on reported cases, poor prognostic indices include increased percentage of blast cells, cytopenias involving more than one lineage, and cellular atypia. Primary MDSs are clonal disorders and are considered neoplastic. Complex classification schemes for human MDS, based on percentages of blasts in bone marrow, cytogenetic analysis, cytopenias, need for transfusions, and other variables, comprise at least nine subtypes; their applicability to veterinary medicine is unknown. 5 Three subtypes are proposed for dogs and cats and include MDS with excessive blasts (MDS-EB), in which blast percentages are greater than 5% and less than 20%, and progression to AML may occur; MDS with refractory cytopenia (MDS-RC) with blast percentages less than 5% and cytopenias in one or more lineages; and MDS with erythroid predominance (MDS-ER) in which the M : E ratio is less than 1 and prognosis is poor. 4 Larger studies are needed to determine the utility of this classification scheme and other potential prognostic indices, such as sex, age, and FeLV positivity. In addition to accumulating enough cases, another confounding factor to studying and classifying MDS is the presence of reversible MDSs population. BCR-ABL translocation has also been reported in a dog with CMoL. 45 In addition to accumulating in bone marrow and peripheral blood, leukemic cells also are found in the red pulp of the spleen, the periportal and sinusoidal areas of the liver, and sometimes lymph nodes. Other organs such as the kidney, heart, and lung are less commonly affected. In addition, extramedullary hematopoiesis may be present in the liver and spleen. Death is usually due to complications of infection or hemorrhage secondary to neutrophil dysfunction and thrombocytopenia. In some cases, CML may terminate in \"blast crisis, \" in which there is a transformation from a predominance of well-differentiated granulocytes to excessive numbers of poorly differentiated blast cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow. This phenomenon is well documented in the dog. 75, 76, 78 Basophilic and Eosinophilic Leukemia Basophilic leukemia, although rare, has been reported in dogs and is characterized by an increased WBC count with a high proportion of basophils in peripheral blood and bone marrow. [84] [85] [86] Hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and thrombocytosis may be present. All the dogs have been anemic. Basophilic leukemia should be distinguished from mast cell leukemia (mastocytosis). Whether dogs develop eosinophilic leukemia remains in question. Reported cases have had high blood eosinophil counts and eosinophilic infiltrates in organs. 87, 88 One dog responded well to treatment with corticosteroids. The distinction between neoplastic proliferation of eosinophils and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome remains elusive. Disorders associated with eosinophilia such as parasitism, skin diseases, or diseases of the respiratory and GI tracts should be considered first in an animal with eosinophilia. One distinguishing feature should be clonality, with reactive eosinophilia comprising polyclonal cells and the neoplastic condition arising from a single clone. As clonality assays become more available, this discrepancy may be resolved.",

There are no blast cells in circulation, and marked megakaryocytic hyperplasia of the bone marrow without myelofibrosis is present. Thrombosis and bleeding are the most common sequelae, and most patients have splenomegaly. Other MPDs, especially PV, should be ruled out, and importantly, there should be no primary disorders associated with reactive thrombocytosis. 89 These include inflammation, hemolytic anemia, iron deficiency anemia, malignancies, recovery from severe hemorrhage, rebound from immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and splenectomy. In addition, certain drugs such as vincristine can induce thrombocytosis. Essential thrombocythemia has been recognized in dogs. 33, [90] [91] [92] [93] In one dog, the platelet count exceeded 4 million/\u00b5L and bizarre giant forms with abnormal granulation were present. The bone marrow contained increased numbers of megakaryocytes and megakaryoblasts, but circulating blast cells were not seen. Other findings included splenomegaly, GI bleeding, and increased numbers of circulating basophils. Causes of secondary or reactive thrombocytosis were ruled out. 90 Basophilia was also reported in a more recent case. 92 In another dog, primary thrombocytosis was diagnosed and then progressed to CML. 33 In some cases reported in the literature as essential thrombocythemia, the dogs had microcytic hypochromic anemias. Because iron deficiency anemia is associated with reactive or secondary thrombocytosis, care must be taken to rule or thrombocytopenia are usually present. Occasionally, neoplastic cells can be found in cerebrospinal fluid in animals with invasion of the CNS. Smears of aspirates from tissues such as the lymph nodes, spleen, or liver may contain blasts but usually contribute little to the diagnostic work-up.",

Blasts in megakaryocytic leukemia may contain vacuoles and have cytoplasmic blebs. In addition, bizarre macroplatelets may be present. Although these distinguishing morphologic features may suggest a definitive diagnosis, cytochemical staining or immunophenotyping are usually required to define the lineage of the blasts.

            "text": "The Animal Leukemia Group has recommended the following diagnostic criteria, summarized in Figure 32 -19. 3 Using wellprepared Romanowsky-stained blood and bone marrow films, a minimum of 200 cells are counted to determine the leukocyte differential in blood and the percentage of blast cells in bone marrow and/or blood. In bone marrow, blast cells are calculated both as a percentage of all nucleated cells (ANC) and nonerythroid cells (NEC) and are further characterized using cytochemical markers. [102] [103] [104] Neutrophil differentiation is identified by positive staining of blasts for peroxidase, Sudan Black B, and chloracetate esterase. Nonspecific esterases (alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase or alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase), especially if they are inhibited by sodium fluoride, mark monocytes. Canine monocytes may also contain a few peroxidase-positive granules. Acetylcholinesterase is a marker for megakaryocytes in dogs and cats. In addition, positive immunostaining for von Willebrand's factor (factor VIII-related antigen) and platelet glycoproteins on the surface of blasts identifies them as megakaryocyte precursors. 10, [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] Alkaline phosphatase (AP) only rarely marks normal cells in dogs and cats but is present in blasts cells in acute myeloblastic and myelomonocytic leukemias. However, owing to reports of AP activity in lymphoid leukemias in dogs, its specificity as a marker for myeloid cells is not certain. Omega exonuclease is a specific marker for basophils, which are also positive for chloracetate esterase activity. 86 Blood and bone marrow differential counts and cytochemical staining should be performed and interpreted by experienced veterinary cytopathologists. If erythroid cells are less than 50% of ANC and the blast cells are greater than 30%, a diagnosis of AML or AUL is made. If erythroid cells are greater than 50% of ANC and the blast cells are greater than 30%, a diagnosis of erythroleukemia (M6) is made. If rubriblasts are a significant proportion of the blast cells, a diagnosis of M6Er, or erythroleukemia with erythroid predominance, can be made. It should be noted that in the human AML classification system, the blast threshold has been lowered to 20% and similar recommendations are being made for AML in dogs and cats.",

Low numbers of nucleated RBCs are present in the blood of about half the dogs with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. 3 Nonregenerative anemia and thrombocytopenia are present in most cases. Anemia is usually normocytic and normochromic, although macrocytic anemia is sometimes present. Pathogenic mechanisms include effects of inhibitory factors leading to ineffective hematopoiesis, myelophthisis, immune-mediated anemia secondary to neoplasia, and hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, or DIC. Anemia is most severe in AML, although both anemia and thrombocytopenia may be milder in animals with the M5 subtype (acute monocytic leukemia). In myelofibrosis, the anemia is characterized by anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. In addition, pancytopenia and leukoerythroblastosis, in which immature erythroid and myeloid cells are in circulation, may be present. These phenomena probably result from replacement of marrow by fibrous tissue with resultant shearing of red cells and escape of immature cells normally confined to bone marrow. In PV, the PCV is increased, usually in the range of 65% to 85%. The bone marrow is hyperplastic, and the M : E ratio is usually in the normal range.",

AML is diagnosed on the basis of finding blast cells with clearly visible nucleoli in blood and bone marrow. Most dogs with acute leukemia have circulating blasts. These cells may be present in low numbers in peripheral blood, and a careful search of the smear, especially at the feathered edge, should be made. Even if blasts are not detected in circulation, indications of bone marrow disease such as nonregenerative anemia increases in these cell types. In order to make a diagnosis of PV, it must first be established that the polycythemia is absolute rather than relative. In relative polycythemias, plasma volume is decreased from hemoconcentration, dehydration, or hypovolemia, and the absolute RBC mass is not increased. Splenic contraction can also result in relative polycythemia. Absolute polycythemia, in which RBC mass is increased, is usually secondary to tissue hypoxia, causing appropriate increased production of erythropoietin. Rarely, erythropoietin may be produced inappropriately by a tumor (e.g., renal cell carcinoma) or in renal disease (pyelonephritis) or localized renal hypoxia. [109] [110] [111] These causes of polycythemia should be eliminated by appropriate laboratory work, thoracic radiographs, arterial blood gas analysis, and renal ultrasonography. In humans with PV, plasma erythropoietin (EPO) levels are low. EPO levels in dogs with PV tend to be low or low-normal, whereas in animals with secondary absolute polycythemia, the levels are high. 112, 113 Samples for determination of EPO concentrations should be taken prior to therapeutic phlebotomy used to treat hyperviscosity and, owing to fluctuations in EPO levels, should be repeated if results are incongruous with other information.",

Basophilic leukemia must be differentiated from mastocytosis based on the morphology of the cell type present. Basophils have a segmented nucleus and variably sized granules, whereas mast cells have a round-to-oval nucleus that may be partially or totally obscured by small, round, metachromatic-staining granules. This distinction is usually easy to make; however, in basophilic leukemia, changes in the morphology of the nucleus and granules make the distinction less clear. 85 Essential thrombocythemia has been diagnosed based on finding persistent and excessive thrombocytosis (>600,000/\u00b5L) without circulating blast cells and in the absence of another MPD (e.g., PV), myelofibrosis, or disorders known to cause secondary thrombocytosis. 89 These include iron deficiency anemia, chronic inflammatory diseases, recovery from severe hemorrhage, rebound from immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and absence of a spleen. Thrombocytosis is transient in these disorders or abates with resolution of the primary disease. In essential thrombocythemia, platelet morphology may be abnormal, with bizarre giant forms and abnormal granulation. 90 In the bone marrow, megakaryocytic hyperplasia is a consistent feature, and dysplastic changes may be evident in megakaryocytes. 93 Spurious hyperkalemia may be present in serum samples from dogs with thrombocytosis from any cause due to the release of potassium from platelets during clot formation. 114 Measuring potassium in plasma is recommended in these cases and usually demonstrates a potassium concentration within reference interval. Platelet aggregability has been appropriate markers for animal species (see later). Increasingly, cytogenetic abnormalities are being identified in animal leukemias; cytogenetic analysis may yield important diagnostic and prognostic information and become a valuable tool for identifying targeted therapeutic approaches.",

Cells can be immunophenotyped using flow cytometric analysis or immunocytochemistry. 20, 63, [105] [106] [107] [108] Cells from both acute lymphoid leukemia and AML are positive for CD34. Many lymphocyte markers, including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD18, CD21, CD45, CD79, and IgG, are available for dogs and can be used to rule out lymphoblastic leukemia in dogs with acute leukemias. 63, 105 Other markers include myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD11b for myeloid cells and CD41 for megakaryoblasts. There is some overlap in expression of these cellular antigens. For example, canine (but not human) granulocytes express CD4. It is best to use a panel of antibodies (similar to using a battery of cytochemical stains) because antigens are often expressed on multiple lineages, and lineage infidelity can occur. These tests have become more valuable with the availability of canine reagents. Currently, the ACVP Oncology Committee recommends that the following immunophenotyping panel be done on bone marrow and/ or blood smears to characterize animal leukemias: for B lymphocytes, CD79a; for T lymphocytes, CD3; for myeloid cells, MPO and CD11b; for megakaryoblasts, CD41; for dendritic cells, CD1c; and for acute leukemias, CD34. 20 Because of the degree of differentiation of cells in MPN, these disorders must be distinguished from nonneoplastic causes of lymphoma, could be used as maintenance therapy. 9, 118 Another protocol that has been used in treating acute myeloblastic leukemia is presented in Table 32 -13.",

Elucidation of the pathogenesis of this disorder should be aided by the recent cloning of the genes for thrombopoietin and its receptor, the proto-oncogene mpl. 115 In MDS, abnormalities in two or three cell lines are usually manifested in peripheral blood as neutropenia with or without a left shift, nonregenerative anemia, or thrombocytopenia.

Dyserythropoiesis is characterized by asynchronous maturation of erythroid cells typified by large hemoglobinized cells with immature nuclei (megaloblastic change). If the erythroid component is dominant, the MDS is called MDS-Er (see Table 32 -12) . 3, 32 In dysgranulopoiesis, giant neutrophil precursors and abnormalities in nuclear segmentation and cytoplasmic granulation can be seen. Finally, dysthrombopoiesis is characterized by giant platelets and micromegakaryocytes.",

Currently, this is best accomplished by cytoreductive chemotherapy, and the agents most commonly utilized include a combination of Ara-C plus an anthracycline, such as doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone.* In humans, the introduction of cytosine arabinoside has been the single most important development in the therapy of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. 120 In dogs, Ara-C, 100 to 200 mg/m 2 , given by slow infusion (12 to 24 hrs) daily for 3 days and repeated weekly, has been used, as well as several other variations using subcutaneous injections of cytosine (see Chapter 11) . Doxorubicin, 30 mg/m 2 IV every 2 to 3 weeks, can be administered at intervals alternating with Ara-C. If remission is achieved, as evidenced by normalization of the hemogram, the COAP protocol (cyclophosphamide, vincristine (Oncovin), Ara-C, and prednisone), as described for canine \u2022 benzene (chronic exposure), and alkylating agents. 130 New classification systems have incorporated genetic mutations, more accurately reflect prognoses, and facilitate use of consistent categorization among institutions. 131 Therapeutic modalities under investigation or development include combination chemotherapy, immunotherapy, cytokine therapy, drug-resistance modulators, proapoptotic agents, antiangiogenic factors, signal transduction-active agents, and bone marrow transplantation. The prognosis for MPN is better than for AML. For acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, the prognosis is better for children than adults, with only 10% of adults receiving chemotherapy maintaining remissions for more than 5 years. 130 The spontaneous canine diseases probably occur too infrequently to serve as useful models. Myeloid neoplasms have been induced experimentally in the dog by irradiation and transplantation in an attempt to create models for study. Many similarities between human and canine myeloid neoplasms exist, and veterinary medicine may benefit from any therapeutic advances made in the human field.",

Genetic predispositions, molecular aberrations (e.g., c-Kit), viral infections, chronic immune stimulation, and exposure to carcinogen stimulation have all been suggested as contributing factors. 6,13-18 Suggestion of a familial association in cats follows cases reported among siblings. 12 Evidence exists that molecular mechanisms of cellular control, including overexpression of cell cycle control components like cyclin D1 (see Chapter 2) and receptor tyrosine kinase dysregulation may be involved in canine myeloma and plasma cell tumors. 17, 18 In rodent models, chronic immune stimulation and exposure to implanted silicone gel have been associated with development of MM, 13, 14 as have chronic infections and prolonged hyposensitization therapy in humans. 15 Viral Aleutian disease of mink results in monoclonal gammopathies in a small percentage of cases. 16 Exposure to the agricultural industry, petroleum products, and irradiation are known risk factors for development in humans. [19] [20] [21] Additionally, progression of solitary plasma cell tumors to MM has been reported in both dogs and cats, and a single case of a B-cell lymphoma progressing to MM exists in the dog. 22, 23 Pathology and Natural Behavior Multiple myeloma is a systemic proliferation of malignant plasma cells or their precursors arising as a clone of a single cell that usually involves multiple bone marrow sites in dogs. In cats, as previously stated, a blurring of the distinction of MM and multicentric noncutaneous EMP within the MRD occurs because widespread abdominal organ involvement without significant bone marrow infiltration has been described in a significant proportion of cases in European compilations. 11, 24 Because both MM and multicentric noncutaneous EMP have a similar clinical course and widespread systemic involvement with hyperglobulinemia in cats, they will be \uf06e SECTION D Ig-secreting lymphomas and leukemias (including plasma cell leukemia). MM is the most important MRD based on clinical incidence and severity. There appears to be some discordance and below 37\u00b0 C and require blood collection and clotting to be performed at 37\u00b0 C prior to serum separation. If whole blood is allowed to clot at temperatures below this, the protein precipitates in the clot and is lost. Pure light-chain M component is rare but has been reported in both dogs and cats. 38, 39 The pathology associated with MM is a result of either high levels of circulating M component, organ or bone infiltration with neoplastic cells, or both. Associated pathologic conditions include bone disease, bleeding diathesis, hyperviscosity syndrome, renal disease, hypercalcemia, immunodeficiency (and subsequent susceptibility to infections), cytopenias secondary to myelophthisis, and cardiac failure.",

            "text": "Bone lesions can be isolated, discrete osteolytic lesions (including pathologic fractures) (Figure 32-22, A) or diffuse osteopenias, or both (Figure 32-23) . Approximately one-quarter to two-thirds of dogs with MM have radiographic evidence of bony lysis or diffuse osteoporosis. 1, 5, 6 The incidence of radiographic skeletal lesions in cats varies tremendously within reports, from as few as 8% in European case series to as high as 65% in North American case series. 8, 9, 11, 12, 26 Those bones engaged in active hematopoiesis are more commonly affected and include the vertebrae, ribs, pelvis, skull, and proximal or distal long bones. Skeletal lesions are rare with IgM (Waldenstr\u00f6m's) macrogammaglobulinemia, in which malignant cells often infiltrate the spleen, liver, and lymph tissue rather than bone. 6, [40] [41] [42] Bleeding diathesis can result from one or a combination of events. M components may interfere with coagulation by (1) inhibiting platelet aggregation and the release of platelet factor-3; (2) causing adsorption of minor clotting proteins; (3) generating abnormal fibrin polymerization; and (4) producing a functional decrease in calcium. 6 to very large anaplastic round cells (often referred to as plasmablasts), with a high mitotic index representing early stages of differentiation. 5, 6, 9, 24, 25 Binucleate and multinucleate cells are often present (see Figure 7 -32, Chapter 7). In 16 cats with MM in a North American case series, the majority (83%) of plasma cells were immature and had marked atypia, including increased size, multiple nuclei, clefted nuclei, anisocytosis, anisokaryosis, variable N : C ratios, decreased chromatin density, and variable nucleoli; nearly one-quarter had \"flame cell\" morphology characterized by peripheral eosinophilic cytoplasmic processes. 9 However, in a European compilation of feline multicentric noncutaneous MRD cases (n = 17), 78% had well-differentiated morphologies. 24 The authors of this latter case series developed a grading system dependent on the percentage of plasmablasts within the neoplastic cells in which well-differentiated, intermediate-grade, and poorly differentiated have less than 15%, 15% to 49%, and 50% or more plasmablasts, respectively. Malignant plasma cells typically produce an overabundance of a single type of or component of immunoglobulin, which is referred to as the M component (Figure 32-21) . The M component can be represented by any class of the entire immunoglobulin or only a portion of the molecule, such as the light chain (Bence Jones protein) or heavy chain (heavy chain disease) of the molecule. In the dog, the M component is usually represented by either IgA or IgG immunoglobulin types in nearly equal incidence, whereas the ratio of IgG : IgA in cats is approximately 5 : 1 in some reports and approximately 1 : 1 in others. 1, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 24, 26 That being said, in the author's (DMV) experience, the vast majority of canine cases are of the IgA type. If the M component is the IgM type, the term macroglobulinemia (Waldenstr\u00f6m's) is often applied. Several cases of biclonal gammopathy in dogs and cats have been reported. 9, 11, 12, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] Several cases of nonsecretory MM have been reported in dogs. 33, 34 Rarely, cryoglobulinemia occurs in dogs with MM and IgM macroglobulinemia and has been reported in a cat with IgG myeloma. 6, [35] [36] [37] Cryoglobulins are paraproteins that are insoluble at temperatures A B nonneoplastic immunoglobulin production. In the case of MM, an unbalanced excess of light-chain products may be produced. Light chains are of low molecular weight and are normally filtered by the renal glomerulus, and their presence in urine can result in protein precipitates and subsequent renal tubular injury. The presence of light chains in urine without a concomitant monoclonal spike in serum, although rare, is indicative of pure light-chain disease. 38 Tubules become obstructed by large laminated casts containing albumin, immunoglobulin, and light chains. 6, 38, 43, 44 Bence Jones proteinuria occurs in approximately 25% to 40% of dogs with MM. 1, 5, 6 Bence Jones proteinuria is reported to occur in approximately 40% of cats with MM/MRD. 9, 11 Hypercalcemia is reported in 15% to 20% of dogs with MM and is thought to result primarily from the production of osteoclast-activating factor by neoplastic cells. 1, 6, 54 Other factors, including increased levels of various cytokines, TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 have been implicated in human MM. In two dogs with MM and hypercalcemia, serum elevations in circulating N-terminal PTHrP were noted. 55 Hypercalcemia may also be exacerbated by associated renal disease. Hypercalcemia, initially thought to be a rare event in cats with MM, occurred in 10% to 25% of recently reported cases. 9, 11, 12, 56 Susceptibility to infection and immunodeficiency have long been associated with MM and are often the ultimate cause of death in affected animals. 1, 6, 26 Infection rates in humans with MM are fifteen times higher than normal and usually represent pneumonia or urinary tract infections. 57 Response to vaccination has also been shown to be suppressed in humans with MM. 57 Immunoglobulin levels are often severely depressed in affected animals. 6 In addition, leukopenias may be present secondary to myelophthisis.",

The magnitude of viscosity changes is related to the type, size, shape, and concentration of the M component in the blood. HVS is more common with IgM macroglobulinemias due to the high molecular weight of this class of immunoglobulin. IgA-secreting myelomas (usually present as a dimer in the dog), may undergo polymerization resulting in increased serum viscosity. 1, 6, 45 IgG-associated HVS can also occur, albeit less frequently. High serum viscosity occurs in approximately 20% of dogs with MM and can result in bleeding diathesis, neurologic signs (e.g., dementia, depression, seizure activity, coma), ophthalmic abnormalities (e.g., dilated and tortuous retinal vessels, retinal hemorrhage [ Figure 32 -24], retinal detachment), and increased cardiac workload with the potential for subsequent development of cardiomyopathy.* These consequences are thought to be a result of sludging of blood in small vessels, ineffective delivery of oxygen and nutrients, and coagulation abnormalities. HVS has been reported in cats with IgG-, IgA-, and IgM-secreting tumors. 6, 8, [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] In several of these cases, relative serum viscosity was increased above control ranges.",

All animals should undergo a careful funduscopic examination. Serum electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis are performed to determine the presence of a monoclonal M component (see and to categorize the immunoglobulin class involved. Heat precipitation and electrophoresis of urine may be performed to determine presence of Bence Jones proteinuria possible.

Signs reflective of transverse myelopathies secondary to vertebral column infiltration, pathologic fracture, or extradural mass compression can also occur. 1, 6, 35, 62, 63 One case of ataxia and seizure activity in a dog with EMP secondary to tumor-associated hypoglycemia has been reported. 64 Additionally, paraneoplastic polyneuropathy has been reported in a dog with MM. 65 A history of chronic respiratory infections and persistent fever may also be present in cats. Hepatosplenomegaly and renomegaly can occur due to organ infiltration. Bleeding diathesis due to HVS is less common in the cat; however, epistaxis, pleural and peritoneal hemorrhagic effusions, retinal hemorrhage, and central neurologic signs have been reported. 6, 8, [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] Polydipsia and polyuria can occur secondary to renal disease or hypercalcemia, and dehydration may develop. Hindlimb paresis secondary to osteolysis of lumbar vertebral bodies or extradural compression has been reported in cats. 12, 66 Diagnosis and Staging",

In the absence of osteolytic bone lesions, a diagnosis can also be made if marrow plasmacytosis is associated with a progressive increase in the M component. In the cat, because the degree of bone marrow infiltration may not be as marked, it has been suggested that consideration of plasma cell morphology and visceral organ infiltration (Figure 32 -25) be given in cases with demonstrable M-component disease in the absence of marked (<20%) marrow plasmacytosis. 9, 11, 24 All animals suspected of plasma cell tumors should receive a minimal diagnostic evaluation including a CBC, platelet count, \u2022 because commercial urine dipstick methods are not capable of this determination. Definitive diagnosis usually follows the performance of a bone marrow aspiration in the dog. A bone marrow core biopsy or multiple aspirations may be necessary due to the possibility of uneven clustering or infiltration of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Normal marrow contains less than 5% plasma cells, whereas myelomatous marrow often greatly exceeds this level. Current recommendations require more than 20% marrow plasmacytosis to be present, although a 10% cutoff in cats has been recently recommended with special attention to cellular atypia. 9 Even the 10% threshold is problematic in cats, and cellular atypia and visceral organ involvement (assessed through needle aspiration cytology or tissue biopsy) should be considered equally important in the species. 9, 11, 24 Rarely, biopsy of osteolytic lesions (i.e., Jamshidi core biopsy; see Chapter 24) is necessary for diagnosis in the dog. In one case of MM in a dog, splenic aspirates were diagnostically helpful. 67 Overall frequencies of clinical diagnostic abnormalities for dogs and cats with MM are compiled from published series having at least five cases each and are listed in Table 32 -16.",

In one case series in cats, 85% of organs with ultrasonographic abnormalities were subsequently confirmed to have plasma cell infiltration. 11 Skeletal survey radiographs are recommended to determine presence and extent of osteolytic lesions, which may have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications. Although nuclear scintigraphy (bone scan) for clinical staging of dogs with MM has been performed, due to the predominant osteolytic activity with osteoblastic inactivity present, scans seldom give positive results and are therefore not useful for routine diagnosis. 69 In physician-based oncology, bone mineral density analysis (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DEXA] scan) to document osteoporosis, MRI scan of bone marrow, and PET/CT are commonly used for staging; however, these modalities have not been applied consistently in the veterinary literature.

Chlorambucil has also been used in cats with MRD. 11 Lomustine (CCNU), yet another alkylating agent, has been used in a limited number of cats with MM and a partial response has been reported following dosing at 50 mg/m 2 PO, every 21 days. 74",

Objective laboratory improvement, including reduction in serum globulin, immunoglobulin, and calcium, along with normalization of the hemogram, is usually noted within 3 to 6 weeks ( Figure 32-26) . Radiographic improvement in osteolytic bone lesions may take months and resolution may only be partial. Ophthalmic complications (including long-standing retinal detachments) and paraneoplastic neuropathies can be expected to resolve along with tumor mass. 48, 65 In cats responding to chemotherapy, clinical improvement is noted in 2 to 4 weeks and serum protein and radiographic bone abnormalities were greatly improved by 8 weeks. 11, 12 As previously discussed, complete resolution of MM does not generally occur and a good response is defined as a reduction in measured M component (i.e., immunoglobulin or Bence Jones proteins) of at least 50% of pretreatment values. 6 Reduction in serum immunoglobulin levels may lag behind reductions in Bence Jones proteinuria because the half-lives are 15 to 20 days and 8 to 12 hours, respectively. 75 For routine follow-up, quantification of the increased serum globulin, immunoglobulin, or urine Bence Jones protein is performed monthly until a good response is noted and then every 2 to 3 months thereafter. Repeat bone marrow aspiration or imaging (in the case of visceral disease) for evaluation of plasma cell infiltration may be occasionally necessary. Bone marrow reevaluation is particularly prudent when cytopenias develop during chemotherapy, and drug-induced myelosuppression must be differentiated from myelophthisis due to neoplastic marrow recurrence.",

All diagnostic procedures should be completed before initiating primary therapy to ensure a diagnosis is complete and baseline values are procured for monitoring response. Chemotherapy is effective at reducing myeloma cell burden, relieving bone pain, allowing for skeletal healing, and reducing levels of serum immunoglobulins in the majority of dogs with MM and will greatly extend both the quality and quantity of most patients' lives. MM in dogs is initially a gratifying disease to treat for both the clinician and the companion animal owner, although complete elimination of neoplastic myeloma cells is rarely achieved and eventual relapse is to be expected. Unlike dogs, only one-half of cats with MM will respond to chemotherapy and most responses will be short-lived; however, several long-term responses (i.e., >1 year) have been reported and treatment should be attempted when educated clients decide on a therapeutic option.* Melphalan, an alkylating agent, is the chemotherapeutic of choice for the treatment of multiple myeloma. 1, 6 In the dog, an initial starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg PO, once daily for 10 days, is then reduced to 0.05 mg/kg PO, once daily continuously. The addition of prednisone therapy is thought to increase the efficacy of melphalan therapy. Prednisone is initiated at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg PO, once daily for 10 days, then reduced to 0.5 mg/kg every other day prior to discontinuation after 60 days of therapy. Melphalan, however, is continued at 0.05 mg/kg/day until clinical relapse occurs or myelosuppression necessitates a dose reduction. The vast majority of dogs on melphalan and prednisone combination therapy tolerate the regimen well. The most clinically significant toxicity of melphalan is myelosuppression, in particular a delayed thrombocytopenia. CBCs, including platelet counts, should be performed biweekly for 2 months of therapy and monthly thereafter. If significant myelosuppression occurs (usually thrombocytopenia or neutropenia), reduction of the dosage or treatment frequency may be necessary. An alternative pulse-dosing regimen for melphalan (7 mg/m 2 PO, daily for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks) has been used successfully by the author in a small number of cases in which myelosuppression was limiting more conventional continuous low-dose therapy. This pulse-dose regimen is now being used first-line by the author with the caveat that long-term response data are currently lacking.",

The presence of hypercalcemia, Bence Jones proteinuria, and extensive bony lysis are known negative prognostic indices in the dog. 1 The long-term prognosis for dogs with MM is poor because recurrence of tumor mass and associated clinical signs is expected. Eventually, the tumor is no longer responsive to available chemotherapeutics and death follows from renal failure, sepsis, or euthanasia for intractable bone or spinal pain. 1, 6 The prognosis for MM in the cat is not as favorable in the short term as it is in the dog. 6, 9, 11, 12, 26 Whereas most cats (approximately 60%) transiently respond to melphalan/prednisone or COP-based protocols, most responses are partial and not durable.

A number of large case compilations of cutaneous plasmacytoma have been reported in the dog. 17, [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] The most common locations for EMP in the dog are cutaneous (86%; Figure 32 -28), the mucous membranes of the oral cavity and lips (9%; Figure 32 -29) , and the rectum and colon (4%). The skin of the limbs and head (including the ears) are most frequently reported cutaneous sites. Other sites accounted for only 1% of the remaining cases and can include stomach, spleen, genitalia, eye, uterus, liver, larynx, trachea, third eyelid, sinonasal cavity, and intracranial sites. [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] The American cocker spaniel, English cocker spaniel, and West Highland white terrier (and perhaps Yorkshire terriers, Boxers, German shepherds, and Airedale terriers) are at increased risk for developing plasmacytomas and the median age of affected dogs is 9 to 10 years of age. 86 Cutaneous and oral EMP in dogs are typically benign tumors that are highly amenable to local therapy. There exists, however, a rare form of multiple cutaneous plasmacytomas in dogs that is part of a more generalized biologically aggressive MM process. 95, 96 The natural behavior of noncutaneous/nonoral EMP appears to be somewhat more aggressive in the dog. GI EMP have been reported on a number of occasions in the veterinary literature, including the esophagus, 91 stomach, 97, 98 and small 99 and large intestine. [98] [99] [100] [101] Metastasis to associated lymph nodes is more common in these cases; however, bone marrow involvement and monoclonal gammopathies are less commonly encountered.

Systemic therapy is not initiated unless systemic involvement is documented. Systemic chemotherapy has been used following gastric EMP in a cat; however, the utility of adjuvant therapy in the species is unknown. 115 Long-term follow-up of patients with SOP is indicated in order to recognize both recurrence of disease and systemic spread.

Neither tumor cell proliferation rate (as measured by Ki67 immunohistochemistry) in the dog nor histopathologic grading in dogs and cats were prognostic in large compilations of cases, although it has been suggested that the polymorphous-blastic and plasmablastic type may act more aggressively in the dog and cat. 17, 24, 86 The presence of amyloid and overexpression of cyclin D1 (prognostic in human plasmacytomas) were not shown to be of prognostic value in dogs. 17 Dogs with EMP of the alimentary tract and other abdominal organs (e.g., liver, uterus) treated by surgical excision alone or in combination with systemic chemotherapy (if metastasis is present) can enjoy longterm survival in the majority of cases.* In a compilation of nine dogs with colorectal plasmacytoma, two dogs had local recurrence at 5 and 8 months following surgery, and the overall median survival was 15 months following surgery alone. 100 DNA ploidy and c-myc oncoprotein expression in biopsy samples were determined to be prognostic for EMPs in dogs; however, those that were malignant were all from noncutaneous sites (i.e., lymph node, colon, spleen).

[92] [93] [94] Successful therapy with melphalan and prednisone has been rarely applied for a local recurrence or incomplete margins in dogs and cats. RT has been used infrequently for cases that are nonsurgical, including the application of strontium-90 plesiotherapy for lingual plasmacytoma in a dog. 113 Surgery is recommended in combination with radiotherapy for those cases of SOP in which the lesion results in an unstable, long bone fracture (see , or the patient is nonambulatory from neurologic compromise resulting from a vertebral body SOP. In the latter case, spinal cord decompression, mass excision, and possibly spinal stabilization may be necessary. 63 Radiotherapy can be used alone (i.e., without surgery) in those cases where fractures are stable, as a palliative measure for bone pain, or in the case of vertebral SOP if the patient is ambulatory and stable. Good local control is usually achieved; however, most go on to develop systemic multiple myeloma. 33, 63, 102 SOP of the axial skeleton can be managed by excision or radiotherapy alone. There is controversy as to whether systemic chemotherapy should be initiated at the time of local therapy for SOP when systemic involvement is not documented. Systemic spread may not occur for many months to even years beyond primary SOP diagnosis in humans and dogs, and studies in humans reveal no benefit derived from initiation of systemic chemotherapy prior to documentation of subsequent systemic spread. 44, 63 Two polymorphous blastic cell types; however, no prognostic significance has been observed following classification, although it has been suggested that the polymorphous-blastic type may act more aggressively in the dog. 17,86,103 A different classification was proposed for EMP in cats based on percentage of plasmablasts (see previous section), and some prognostic importance has been documented. 24 In the case of poorly differentiated plasmacytic tumors, immunohistochemical studies, directed at detecting immunoglobulin, light-and heavy-chains, MM-1/interferon regulatory factor-4 (MUM1/IRF4), and thioflavin T, may be helpful in differentiation from other round cell tumors. 33, 85, 86, [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] Immunoreactivity has been demonstrated for canine IgG F(ab) 2 and vimentin. 82 A variant characterized by an IgG-reactive amyloid interspersed with the neoplastic cells has also been described. 83 A panel of MAbs (recognizing tryptase, chymase, serotonin, CD1a, CD3, CD79a, CD18, MHC class II) in association with a histochemical stain (naphthol AS-D chloroacetate) has been advocated for use on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of cutaneous round cell tumors to help classify poorly differentiated round cell tumors (mast cell tumors, histiocytomas, lymphomas, and plasmacytomas). 109 Additionally, clonality of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene can be performed in plasmacytomas and myelomas using PCR technology, and this may have some diagnostic utility in difficult cases.It is important to thoroughly stage dogs and cats with plasmacytomas that are at higher risk for systemic spread if contemplating local or locoregional therapy without systemic therapy. This should include bone marrow aspiration, serum electrophoresis, abdominal ultrasound, and skeletal survey radiographs to ensure the disease is confined to a local site prior to initiation of therapy. This is most important in cases of SOP and GI EMP due to their relatively high metastatic rate and less important for cutaneous, oral, and colorectal plasmacytomas because of their more typical benign behavior.
