For this, nasopharyngeal swab specimens (NPS) collected from a network of more than 80 practitioners participating actively to the clinical surveillance of influenza cases in Switzerland and screened for influenza during the 2010-2011 season were used as follows. After viral genome extraction using the NucliSENS easyMAG (bioM\u00e9rieux, Geneva, Switzerland), the following four onestep real-time RT-PCR assays were applied for the routine screening: the CDC pan-influenza A specific real-time RT-PCR assay [19] considered as a reference assay for influenza type A surveillance by the WHO, and three in-house developed assays specific for A(H1N1)pdm (Swine H1 GE), influenza A(H3N2) (A/H3), and influenza B (InfB MP) detection (supplementary Table 1 ) all validated on WHO quality controls. Each week, a batch of 22 or 46 influenzapositive specimens (according to the number of available specimens) were tested with the PLEX-ID/Flu assay in parallel to the usual real-time RT-PCR assays performed by the Swiss National Reference Centre for Influenza. NPS were selected blind of the real-time RT-PCR threshold cycle (C T ) values and the type of influenza (influenza A or B). For each assay, specific positive and negative internal controls were included systematically in each run to rule out any potential PCR inhibitors or contaminations, respectively. and Wisconsin/01/10 strains, respectively). Of note, the PLEX-ID/Flu assay's subtyping or lineage characterization for A(H3N2) and type B specimens, respectively, is less accurate than for A(H1N1)pdm specimens since HA and NA genes are not included in the analysis. Taken together, the PLEX-ID/Flu assay detected positively and gave a typing/lineage characterization result for 93% of all NPS detected positively by real-time RT-PCR. Positive results obtained by both methods were always in agreement. All non-typeable influenza A and B specimens by the PLEX-ID/Flu assay showed relatively low viral loads with C T values 33 obtained with the screening real-time RT-PCR assays.",

            "text": "Among these 37 specimens, the PLEX-ID/Flu assay was able to subtype 9/19 influenza A (47.5%) and characterize the lineage for 14/18 influenza B (77.8%). The Sanger-based sequencing method was able to subtype 13/19 influenza A (68.4%) and identify the lineage for 9/18 influenza B (50%). Therefore, for these selected specimens, the PLEX-ID/Flu assay demonstrates a sensitivity for influenza B virus lineage characterization that is at least similar to the Sanger-based method, which is directly dependent on conditions used for viral genome amplification by classical PCR. However, the latter appears more sensitive for influenza A subtyping under these conditions. This observation can be explained by the PLEX-ID/Flu assay algorithm that requires the analysis of nucleotide base composition signatures of a minimum of three positive PCRs out of eight independent primer pairs present in the assay, with the mandatory coupling of detection and subtyping processes, for influenza A specimen analysis. Therefore, the typing constraint of the PLEX-ID/Flu assay explains partially the higher influenza A subtyping performance of the Sanger-based method for low viral load specimens. Indeed, 9/10 influenza A NPS detected positive by real-time RT-PCR could not be subtyped with the PLEX-ID/Flu assay, although one or two positive PCR signals were observed. Although the minimal requirement of three independent PCR signals for subtyping was not obtained, specific influenza A PCR amplifications were detected, suggesting a sensitivity threshold close to the realtime RT-PCR.",

            "text": "Based on a selection of positive NPS collected in Switzerland during the 2010-2011 influenza season, this study suggests that the PLEX-ID/Flu assay is a convenient platform for the detection, typing, and subtyping (lineage characterization for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses. The detection rate observed with the PLEX-ID platform, as well as the subtyping or lineage characterization of human influenza virus types A and B tends to suggest that it might play a role in the near future in most routine laboratories, but this needs to be confirmed in prospective and large comparative studies. In addition, the sensitivity of the PLEX-ID/Flu observed in this study could be increased if any positive PCR results were considered and if the typing result is not a requirement. However, this pilot study has intrinsic limitations mainly related to the fact that only realtime RT-PCR-positive specimens were selected initially. This precludes any appropriate evaluation of the respective sensitivity or specificity of the method. Compared to sequence analysis, the PLEX-ID/Flu assay has also limitations in terms of identification of specific mutations potentially involved in antiviral resistance, as well as drifted strains. Finally, the lack of accurate typing concerning the HA and NA genes is a major drawback and possibly limits the use of this assay as a first line diagnostic tests. ",

The analysis included also 29 influenza-negative NPS as negative controls. Most PLEX-ID experiments could be performed within 24 h following realtime RT-PCR analysis (181/230), whereas 49 NPS had to be analyzed after storage for 72 h at 4\u00b0, or after a freeze-thaw cycle. For influenza A real-time RT-PCR-positive specimens, the PLEX-ID/Flu assay could subtype successfully 105/115 cases (91.3%), corresponding to 101/111 A(H1N1)pdm (91%; all related to A/Hong Kong/2212/10 (H1N1)p) and 4/4 A(H3N2) (100%; all related to A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)) viruses. For influenza B real-time RT-PCR-positive specimens, the assay characterized successfully the lineage for 82/86 cases (95.3%; 73 and 9 specimens appear related to HongKong/514/2009",
