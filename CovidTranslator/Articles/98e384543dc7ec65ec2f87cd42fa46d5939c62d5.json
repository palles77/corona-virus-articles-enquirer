Because of the potentially devastating progression of NEC, precautions need to be taken. In this scenario, clinical judgment based on the patient's condition should guide whether and how long the patient should be taken off enteral feedings, whether and how long intravenous antibiotics should be used, and how aggressively the patient is monitored with radiographs and laboratory tests. Once a definitive diagnosis is made but the patient has not progressed to surgical NEC (usually stage 3), the bowel should be decompressed using a large-bore orogastric tube with low intermittent suction. Careful attention needs to be placed on managing fluids and electrolytes because considerable third spacing of fluids with losses of sodium and protein may occur. Potassium fluxes (high or low serum potassium) with acidbase imbalances are likely to occur. Renal failure is a frequent concomitant finding. Systemic antibiotic therapy, usually with ampicillin and gentamicin, are started after obtaining blood cultures. In cases in which resistant Staphylococcus epiderrnidis is suspected, vancomycin is used instead of ampicillin. When perforation is suspected, or has occurred, clindamycin or metronidazole is used to treat anaerobic infection. Intensive support of respiratory and circulatory status is provided, as are frequent monitoring of the abdominal status with left lateral decubitus radiographs and frequent monitoring of acid-base and hematologic status. A persistent acidosis with continued deterioration of platelet and white blood cell counts may be an indication for surgery even in the absence of overt perforation on radiography.",

O, 19, 72, loo This includes epidemiologic evidence for outbreaks suggestive of an infective process, the frequent isolation of infectious agents with NEC, and the decreased incidence of NEC resulting from preventive measures. Because many of the bacteria isolated from infants with NEC (from stool, blood, and peritoneal fluid) are organisms commonly found in the intestine, it is impossible to tell whether the presence of these bacteria is a causative factor or whether they are merely bystanders to a separate pathologic process. The latter is unlikely because of the large number of infants with NEC who exhibit overt pneumatosis intestinalis. If one uses Bell's criteria for the diagnosis of \"proven\" NEC (stage 2), the radiologic finding of pneumatosis is a necessary component. The gas in pneumatosis is thought to be derived primarily from bacterial fermentati~n.~~, 44, Kosloskeh8, h9 presents bacteria as central factors in the \"unifying hypothesis for pathogenesis and prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis.\" Bacteria commonly isolated from infants with NEC are gram-negative rods, including Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacfer spp., and Pseudomonas ~p p .~~ These bacteria can be isolated from blood, peritoneal fluid, intestinal tissues, and feces.28, 81, loo, 122, 131 Other microorganisms associated with NEC are the bacteria Clostvidium difficile and Staphylococcus epidermidis and the viruses coronavirus and rotavirus. The major arguments against etiologic roles for C dificile and S epidermidis in NEC are the high rate of isolation of these bacteria or identification of their toxins in healthy, matched neonates and the lack of consistent recovery or detection of the bacteria or toxins in patients with NEC. 69 Bacterial toxins also have been proposed as causes of NEC105; however, some potent toxins, such as Clostridium toxin, are isolated commonly from asymptomatic infants.37 Because many different infectious agents have been associated with NEC, these agents may possess common virulence factors that may predispose susceptible hosts to the cascade of events involved in the pathophysiologic cascade of NEC. For example, many members of the family Enterobacteriaceae possess genes encoding Shiga-like toxin and cholera-like toxin.', 53, 115 Whether these genes are expressed by NEC pathogens and whether they have any role in disease are still unknown. Other possible common virulence factors may involve metabolic traits that predispose the host to other factors in the pathogenic cascade, such as a high capability to ferment lactose. 26 A majority of very premature babies in the NICU are started on broad-spectrum IV antibiotic therapy shortly after birth during a \"rule out sepsis\" work-up. This can markedly alter the normal flora with which the neonate would become col~nized.~, 55 Rather than becoming colonized with Lactobacillus and other \"normal\" gut flora, resistant species indigenous to the NICU may colonize in the baby's intestine. Whether or how much of a role this has in the pathogenesis of NEC is not known. Recent studies also have shown that NEC-associated bacteria have a greater propensity than non-NEC-associated bacteria of the same species to prevent adherence of gram-positive bacteria to the GI tract and to cause disease in an animal model during coinfection with grampositive isolates from the homologous child?' This could lead to an intestinal milieu consisting of a very large number of organisms more conducive to the development of NEC than would otherwise reside there. Other studies have shown that certain Klebsiella species that have a genetic predisposition (plasmid) for active fermentation of lactose also have the ability to cause NEC in isolated loops of rabbit small intestine.26",

It is tenable that inflammatory mediators released after endotoxin or bacterial invasion across the mucosa may lead to vasoconstriction and hypoxic-ischemic insults. The vascular control systems are known to be quite immature in these infants and could make the premature intestine more susceptible to the development of local tissue hypoxia. 86 Resting vascular resistance is known to be low in premature infants. The endothelium of the small intestine is responsible for the production of nitric oxide, a potent mediator known to maintain low resting vascular resistance. If endothelial injury occurs, subsequent damage to the nitric oxide system likely could have a detrimental effect on local vascular tone, which could, at least theoretically, result in some of the tissue injury seen in NEC that is compatible with an ischemic insult.7x Thus, other triggers, such as bacterial toxins or chemical irritation, could set off a cascade of events that could lead to endothelial disruption, altered nitric oxide production, and subsequently vascular compromise.x6 The specific relationship of endotoxin, PAF, and nitric oxide together with other mediators remains to be elucidated.

An alternative approach with several different names, including \"minimal enteral nutrition,\" \"intestinal priming,\" and \"hypocaloric feedings,\" has been studied in a controlled randomized manner3*, 79 involving use of enteral nutrition to provide topical nutrition to the small intestine during the first week or two of life while providing most of the nutritional needs for the infant by the parenteral route.

Perhaps strong consideration should not be given to pre-emptively treating all premature babies with antibiotics for 3 days pending culture results as is so commonly done. Obviously, the risk of sepsis needs to be carefully weighed against the likelihood of altering the bacterial microenvironment in each individual baby. Some bacteria cultured from babies with NEC have been found to have the capability to inhibit adherence of normal gut flora to CaCo-2 cells in culture. 92 Other studies have shown that certain bacteria isolated from neonates with NEC have a highly efficient capability to ferment lactose in the presence of hydrolytic products of These bacteria in turn were found to have the capability to produce severe intestinal damage in isolated rabbit intestinal loops. When isolated from the original bacterium and cloned into an otherwise nonpathogenic bacterium, the previously nonpathogenic bacterium becomes a rapid lactose fermenter and is able to cause disease in the isolated rabbit intestinal loops. There are likely to be numerous other virulence traits possessed by NEC-associated bacteria that have not yet been identified. Identification of these traits, proof of their pathogenicity, and subsequent production of neither active nor passive immunity against them offer the likelihood of specific prophylaxis against NEC.",

A specific nutrient, such as glutamine or nucleotides, may be involved. Glutamine is one of the most important metabolic substrates for the GI tract. This amino acid has been found to attenuate various forms of enterocolitis in animal models and to decrease permeability to lactulose and mannitol in adults. It is thought to become an essential amino acid during times virulence factors of stress. It is not normally supplied to these babies in appreciable quantities by either the enteral or parenteral route because most premature neonates are not provided with appreciable enteral nutrition, and neonatal TPN solutions do not contain glutamine. Other growth factors and hormones that are known to directly improve GI function and maturity, such as epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, and thyroid hormone, also offer a fertile area for future investigation for the prevention of NEC.",

Inhibitors of PAF, stimulators or inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, cytokines, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes may have a role in the future prevention of NEC. Although intervening in the inflammatory cascade seems to offer hope, the disease may be so far advanced that rescue at this stage is no longer likely, and prevention may be impossible. Intervention into more proximal events in the pathologic cascade by altering the lumenal milieu by immunizing against microbial virulence factors or maturing the intestinal barrier should offer the most promise for prophylaxis against NEC.",
