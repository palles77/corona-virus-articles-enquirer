The Health Belief Model served as a theoretical framework for the study. Data were generated from 1613 Americans from an online survey. Perceived susceptibility and self-efficacy were found to significantly influence domestic travel avoidance. The findings also supported the significant role of perceived risk, subjective knowledge, age, and gender. Given the possibility that an Ebola outbreak may reemerge in the future and the emergence of additional health-related crises (e.g., Zika virus), the findings may also aid the tourism industry in planning for and responding to other health pandemics.",

Several studies have consistently found that pandemics contribute to heightened concerns about international travel (Lee, Son, Bendle, Kim, & Han, 2012; Kuo, Chen, Tseng, Ju, & Huang, 2008) .",

For instance, during the rising prevalence of H1N1 in 2009, the Australian Government introduced a series of procedures that were geared toward incoming and outgoing travelers (Leggat et al., 2010) . In addition, Leggat, Brown, and Speare (Leggat et al., 2010) found that while more than half of Queensland travelers showed some concern over the pandemic, a majority would not postpone travel even if they demonstrated H1N1-like symptoms. Another study by Lee et al. (2012) found that perceptions associated with H1N1 were not significant predictors of travel intentions. However, Reisinger and Mavondo (2005) found that perceptions of a disease are important indicators of altered travel patterns. One possible explanation is that travelers might develop adaptive behaviors (personal health interventions) which may prevent them from contracting the disease.",

Successful strategies for adoption of behaviors utilize specific cues which are associated with conducting the target behaviors (Cerkoney & Hart, 1980) . Self-efficacy measures one's level of confidence to adopt a behavior. High levels of self-efficacy may lead to the likelihood that behavior is initiated and sustained throughout aversive situations (Bandura, 1977) . Interventions which aim to increase the use of healthy preventive methods will need to take into account the impact of an individual's perceptions of their self-efficacy.

Roehl and Fesenmaier (1992) later identified three dimensions of perceived risk: physical/equipment risk, vacation risk, and destination risk. Sonmez and Graefe (1998) identified four types of risks as most often associated with tourism: financial, psychological, satisfaction, and time. Similarly, Maser and Weiermair (1998) classified travel-related risks into several categories including, but not limited to: natural disasters, hygiene and diseases, crime, and accidents. Richter (2003) added health concerns as another category. These risk factors have been widely examined and consistently found to increase visitors' level of perceived destination risk (Larsen, Brun, & \u00d8gaard, 2009; Pizam & Mansfeld, 1996) . Moreover, Barton (1994) classified 12 possible types of disasters that could affect visitors; three of them were related to natural environments, bacterial infection, and terrorist or war-related activities.",

            "text": "As indicated, notwithstanding some exceptional situations, visitors typically mitigate their risks when traveling (Law, 2006) . Past studies have frequently shown that the tourism industry is often vulnerable because of direct or indirect incidents that might impede the safety of visitors (Maser & Weiermair, 1998; Seddighi & Theochaous, 2001; Elsrud, 2001) . In their study, Leggat and Klein (2001) found that visitors often become anxious and largely depend on the destinations and the host communities for support when something goes awry. To date, there are several studies that have been conducted in the area of risk and travel decision making that demonstrate declines in tourism demand. For instance, the Bali bombings (Wilks & Moore, 2003) , SARS and bird flu in Asia (Pine & McKercher, 2004) , tsunami in Southeast Asia (Morison, 2005) , and the Olympic Games in London (Schroeder et al., 2013) all have been studied in reference to travel and destination risk. Sonmez and Graefe (1998) , for instance, found that perceived risk is a significant predictor of avoiding certain destinations. Likewise, Buttle and Bok (1996) found that environmental influences could affect consumer behavior. Other studies have confirmed that risk perceptions are pivotal factors that influence visitors' travel decisions. When individuals perceive that potential risks outweigh benefits, they are more likely to modify their travel to the destination. In turn, this negatively affects tourism-related businesses and images associated with destinations. Implications of SARS show how a region's economy can be impacted as a consequence of fear of contracting a disease (Yanni, Marano, & Han, 2010) . Leggat et al. (2010) found that while the outbreak of H1N1 in 2009 was of some concern to more than half of the residents of Queensland, Australia, a majority of respondents would not have postponed travel even if they exhibited symptoms consistent with the pandemic. Although a majority of this research is case-based, continuous research in the area of pandemics, risk, and travel is critical to providing information for the tourism industry to better respond in times of health-related crises.",

While the Ebola outbreak has arguably not had the same impacts, concerns have been raised by travelers and government travel advisories. In this study, more than half of our sample indicated that they had concerns regarding Ebola during travel by air and more than half also indicated that they would not avoid traveling in light of recent Ebola cases in the U.S. This is consistent with the fact that airlines in the U.S. remained operational during the outbreak and that while the U.S. government did designate several airports for passenger screening, especially those traveling back from African countries which includes New York's John F. Kennedy, Chicago's O\u2032Hare, Atlanta's Hartfield-Jackson, Newark's Liberty, and Washington's Dulles Airport, the U.S. government travel advisories did not affect both international and domestic air travel. These findings are also consistent with a survey conducted by the Global Business Travel Association, which indicated that most respondents said the outbreak has had a minimal effect on business travel (Martin, 2014) . As such, the quick reactions by the U.S. government to respond to the potential outbreak in the U.S. may have influenced travelers' decisions related to travel and curtailing their travel. Another possible reason is that we only asked respondents about their travel avoidance related to domestic travel (within the U.S.).

American students traveling abroad cited fears associated with contaminated food and water, psychological distress, excessive sun exposure, and physical/sexual assault over fears of contracting certain infectious diseases (e.g. Ebola, the plague) (Hartjes, Baumann, & Henriques, 2009 ). The avoidance of public transportation is cited as one of the most utilized preventive measures to avoid contracting an infectious disease (Sadique et al., 2007) .

The survey was conducted in October of 2014 during the height of the Ebola outbreak, during which time the U.S. public was bombarded with media coverage of the outbreak that might have shaped their perceptions. Thus, it may be challenging to generalize the results of the study beyond the time due to the prevalence of information in the media regarding this crisis. Ibuka et al. (2010) also noted that perceptions of disease changed over time along with the media coverage. Specifically, the decline in the engagement in the preventive health strategies (in this case travel avoidance) may also mirror the decline in media attention regarding Ebola in the United States. As such, further study should explore how perceptions of Ebola and other pandemics changed over time and how it relates to media attention, as well as engagement in the recommended health preventive strategies.

Our results indicated that most respondents considered Ebola to be serious and would take protective measures in response to the outbreak. However, most of them also demonstrated a minimal plan to avoid travel which is parallel with other studies on contagious pandemics. The adapted Health Belief Model helps us to understand this phenomenon. As predicted by the model, those with higher perceptions of risk, perceived susceptibility, and subjective knowledge were found to be more likely to avoid domestic travel, while those with higher levels of self-efficacy demonstrated a lower propensity to avoid travel due to Ebola. It is important to note that the study did not specifically examine the role of \"cues to action.\" This is not to say that the construct is not important. Rather, we were interested in examining the roles of other constructs 3.57 1.02 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. a All 1613 responded to the above survey items. in the Health Belief Model. Therefore, it is recommended that future research includes \"cues to action\" in the model to determine the role of the construct. Finally, due to the multifaceted nature of the issues, further study needs to be conducted to fully understand the complexity of attitudes toward contagious diseases. Additionally, further research could also explore the relationship between the attitudes and perceptions of travelers and travel destinations. Given the improbability surrounding how the 2014 Ebola outbreak may (re)emerge in the future, our results may contribute in planning for and responding to crises in the context of air travel. For instance, travelers may have also considered other logistic costs, such as fees for changing a travel itinerary or extending planned accommodations, as part of decision making in travel avoidance. Although not directly measured in our study, such factors might influence their attitude toward travel avoidance in the wake of Ebola or other pandemics, which warrant further exploration.",
