New pathogens emerge each year, some of which have high mortality and the potential for effi cient transmission-eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 1 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 2 and avian infl uenza A H7N9. 3 Existing pathogens are becoming resistant to available antibiotics and several are now resistant to virtually all available treatment. 4 There is also the potential threat of intentional release of biological agents, which can be developed or synthesised biologically and disseminated at low cost and with little scientifi c expertise. Moreover, the accelerated pace of globalisation amplifi es these risks: a disease is just a plane trip away, and an outbreak anywhere is a threat everywhere.",

            "text": "One of the primary responsibilities of any government is to protect the health and safety of its people. There are three key elements of health security: prevention wherever possible, early detection, and timely and eff ective response. Although many countries are now better able to manage infectious disease threats than in the past, these improvements have often been small in scale and limited in scope. The International Health Regulations (IHR), revised by WHO in 2005 to more directly address new and emerging epidemic threats, 5 require all 194 signatory countries to improve capacity in these and other areas as part of their commitment to protecting health. 6 Yet, at least 80% of countries did not report full IHR compliance by the 2012 deadline. 7 There is a perception in some quarters that tackling epidemic threats is less important than addressing major killers, such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, and that international eff orts to stop outbreaks might be more in the interest of high-income than of lowincome and middle-income countries. 8 In fact, epidemic threats are potentially devastating to development through economic dislocation, decreased productivity, avoidable medical costs, loss of revenues from tourism and travel, and negative incentives for investment. The eff ective implementation of measures to ensure global health security builds a fi rm, broad-based public health foundation that promotes country self-suffi ciency and can sustain health progress in any area in which a country decides to focus. Most fundamentally, addressing epidemic threats saves lives.",

In Uganda and Vietnam, with support from CDC and the US Department of Defense's Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the health ministries enhanced existing non-proprietary information systems and laboratory specimen referral networks for real-time reporting. This approach has already led to early detection and subsequent initiation of timely public health responses to outbreaks in Uganda from pathogens that include Zika virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, hepatitis E virus, Neisseria meningitidis, and multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 15 The time from the start of an outbreak to detection and response has decreased substantially in Uganda, as it has in many other countries that have strengthened disease detection capacity. 16 Eff ective response to epidemics is greatly enhanced by a well trained workforce, coordinated through a public health Emergency Operations Centre. Enhanced facilities, state-of-the-art equipment, standard operating procedures, and objective assessment exercises have been part of the enhancements of Emergency Operations Centres in Uganda and Vietnam. 15, 17 On Feb 13, 2014, the US Government launched a new global health security agenda in partnership with WHO, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, the World Organization for Animal Health, as well as with other countries. 18 The goal is to accelerate progress so that every country has an eff ective system to prevent, detect, and respond to health threats. Over the next 5 years, the USA has committed to working with at least 30 countries to more eff ectively protect at least 4 billion people from naturally occurring, accidental, or intentional infectious disease threats. We are confi dent that with commitment from highincome, middle-income, and low-income countries, every part of the world can better prevent, more rapidly detect, and eff ectively respond to health threats. Core elements of eff ective global health security are summarised in the panel.",
