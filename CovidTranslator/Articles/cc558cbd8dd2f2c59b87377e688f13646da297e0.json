There is evidence that certain mouse viruses, like Hantaan virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and reovirus-3 have all been detected in mouse colonies (Kraft and Meyer, 1990 ) and these viruses have notably caused serious infection, and even fatalities in laboratory workers (Lloyd and Jones, 1986; Mahy et al., 1991) and may also be transmitted in cell lines and reagents (Nicklas et al., 1993) ",

            "text": "In the event of using feeder cells of human origin (Draper et al., 2004; Genbacev et al., 2005) , there are numerous viruses and other infectious agents that are susceptible to being transmitted to the recipient because all human cells have the potential to transmit infectious diseases. The screening should apply to testing for human feeder cells for clinical use, the same as the present regulations that require the screening of cell and tissue products from donors for a spectrum of viruses which cause serious human infectious diseases (UK MSBT, 2000; AATB, 2002) . Virological screening should firstly be carried out for HIV-1/2, hepatitis B and hepatitis C; moreover, recently, the products for transfusion containing cellular material have been tested for the cell associated organisms such as hCMV and HTLV-I/II (Consensus Document, 1999) , although tests for hepatitis A and hepatitis E should also be recommended in such products. Other potentially viral agents that could be contaminants of cells from healthy individuals include human herpesviruses (HHV-6, HHV-7, HHV-8, Epstein -Barr virus, herpes simplex virus), parvovirus B19, TTV virus and human polyomaviruses (JC and BK virus), and these viruses remain latent and detectable in humans from early childhood. The risk of transmission of these microorganisms is considered extremely low, so tests for them are not currently required for transplantation. However, the oncogenic risk of viral contamination must also be considered because some of these agents have been involved in human cancers (Takeuchi et al., 1996; Garbuglia et al., 2003) . Some microbial agents have marked variation in their geographical distribution, producing infectious epidemics in different areas like the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in USA (WNV Update, 2004) and the very recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in humans in South East Asia. Furthermore, two new retroviruses (HTLV-3 and HTLV-4) have been recently identified among African bush-meat hunters (Wolfe et al., 2005) and recent cases of transplant transmitted disease due to rabies virus in USA and Germany (Srinivasan et al., 2005) have been reported, which clearly shows the potential emergence of new serious pathogens or the re-emergence of known pathogens. Obviously, any new entity that arises should be considered as a contamination risk factor, and specific tests may be required, and these may be developed for surveillance initiatives, as in the case of SARS, for which detection methods are being developed for the causative coronavirus agent (Juang et al., 2004) .",

After inoculation, cultures are incubated at 35 to 37 -C for either 14 or 28 days and inspected periodically (e.g. daily) and observed for the cytopathic effect of several viruses, including the recently reported method of analysis of HIV virus cytopathicity by using Hi-CD4 Jurkat T cells cultures (Speirs et al., 2005) . In certain circumstances, the observation period can be greater than 28 days for the identification of many viruses (e.g. human cytomegalovirus).",

This finding has led to the introduction of nucleic acid amplification techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in which the presence of a virus can be observed by means of the amplification of sequences in the viral genome.

            "text": "Several new PCR assays have been developed in which the synthesis of the PCR product is detected in real-time (Realtime quantitative PCR) (Gibson et al., 1996; Heid et al., 1996) . Real-time quantitative PCR is a homogeneous method that includes both amplification and analysis with no need for slab gels, radioactivity or sample manipulation. Reaction products are detected with a fluorescence detection system consisting of a light-emitting diode that delivers excitation light to each reaction tube and an optical unit with three detection channels to record emitted light. The fluorescence of DNA dyes or probes is monitored each cycle during PCR. The simplest system for detection of real-time PCR products uses the DNAbinding dye SYBR Green, which fluoresces when its binds to double-stranded DNA. These methods have several important advantages over conventional PCR. Since the accumulation of PCR product is monitored in the reaction tube, no separate detection method, such as gel electrophoresis, is required, thus shortening the effective assay markedly. Furthermore, the possibility of contamination by amplicons is decreased because the systems are closed, with no handling of the reaction contents after completion of PCR. The use of multiple fluorescent dyes with different emission wavelengths makes it possible to perform multiplex reactions with simultaneous amplification of more than one product. Moreover, other molecular methods have been described and introduced for the viral diagnosis, like nucleic acid probes (Denniston et al., 1986) , Branched DNA signal amplification (Urdea et al., 1991) , nested PCR (Erlich et al., 1991) and multiplex PCR (Dineva et al., 2005) , etc. Real-time multiplex PCR can analyze multiple viruses simultaneously within a single reaction. The main advantages of multiplexing over single-target analysis are the ability to provide internal controls, lower reagent costs and preservation of precious samples. Multiplexing can be particularly important when there is a need to analyze several viruses from the samples. There are several assays that use a real-time multiplex RT-PCR technology for diagnosis of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and HIV-1 virus (Candotti et al., 2004) . There are other authors who have described several assays using this procedures for retroviruses (Vet et al., 1999) and herpesviruses (O'Neill et al., 2003) .",

Confocal microscopy is used to scan the chip, detecting fluorescent signals that reveal hybridization at precise locations on the chip. Use of probes representing all possible nucleotide sequence variations within a target sequence allows rapid determination of nucleotide sequence (Pease et al., 1994) . High density arrays, which may have thousands of individual probes per cm 2 , are referred to as microarrays. These microarrays on silicon surfaces are therefore known as ''DNA chips''.

During the course of prion disease, a largely protease resistant aggregated form of PrP, designated PrP Sc , accumulates mainly in the brain, and may be the main or only constituent of the prion (McKinley et al., 1991) . The detection of this protein can be carried out by means of antibodies of the monoclonal IgG1 subtype, anti-PrP 6H4 (Enari et al., 2001; Parizek et al., 2001) ; this antibody recognizes the sequence DYEDRYYRE in the prion protein (human PrP: amino acids 144 -152). This sequence is conserved in most known mammalian PrP sequences (human, cattle, sheep, rabbit, mink and a variety of primates). 6H4 can be used for Western blotting and ELISA (Prionics, 2002) . There are other monoclonal antibodies for prion protein such as 34C9 that recognizes the sequence LIHFG in the bovine prion protein and a polyclonal antibody R029 that also recognizes bovine PrP.",

In contrast to many other antibodies used for detection of prion protein, 1E4 has a broad species reactivity. Detection of prion protein has been demonstrated with Western blot for humans, cattle, sheep, deer, mice and hamsters. Most of the currently available TSE tests are based on the fact that PrP c , normal prion protein, is digested by proteinase k, whereas PrP Sc , TSE specific prion, is relatively resistant to degradation by proteases. The special feature of 1E4 is that its epitope is almost hidden on non-digested bovine PrP Sc , but after proteinase K digestion, the epitope becomes available resulting in a significant increased detection. After digestion with protease K, 1E4 binds to PrP Sc with high affinity, whereas it has a low affinity for non-digested PrP Sc .",

(2001) have developed a procedure, conceptually similar to polymerase chain reaction cycling, involving cyclic amplification of protein misfolding PrP Sc . This method could allow a rapid conversion of excess PrP c into a protease resistant PrP Sc -like form. In this method, aggregates formed when PrP Sc is incubated with PrP c are disrupted by sonication to generate multiple smaller units for the continued formation of new PrP Sc . After cycling amplification, more than 97% of the protease resistant PrP present in the sample correspond to newly converted protein. This method could be applied to diagnose the presence of undetectable prion infectious agent in tissues and biological fluids. In this respect, recently, Castilla et al. (2005) have been the first to detect the resistant-protein PrP Sc biochemically in hamster blood by means of the cyclic amplification of protein misfolding. This procedure enables detection of prions in blood with 89% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The high level of sensitivity and specificity indicated that this assay offers promise for the design of a sensitive biochemical test for blood diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The implementation of a similar blood-detection procedure for humans and culture-detection method for stem cell lines undoubtedly contributes to minimizing the risk of infection with agents causing transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.",

These include both serious human pathogens but also human and animal viruses and prions capable of multiplying and producing transmissible infectious diseases. Selecting and testing of stem cell lines and biotechnological products (e.g. bovine serum, tripsine, culture media) is one part of a strategy for establishing a viral safety program (Cobo et al., 2006) . While the technology to avoid the animal products in the culture manufacturing is being developed, the safety of the human and/or animal products used in the cell cultures with respect to viral and prion contamination could be obtained for application of an exhaustive program of viral screening by means the combination of techniques above-mentioned (Tables  2 and 3 ). The presence of viruses (including non-pathogenic types) or prions in a human therapeutic product would most likely render it unacceptable for clinical use. At the moment, the cell banks must have a panel of tests to detect serious pathogens like endogenous viruses, exogenous viruses and prions. This panel of tests should necessarily include reverse transcriptase detection as a general test for retroviruses, electron microscopy that can detect different kinds of viral particles and characterize many unknown isolates present in cell cultures and molecular techniques like PCR (conventional or real-time) and RT-PCR tests to include all the viruses that we know pose a risk to the product. For prion detection, these banks must have a procedure based on the Western blot or ELISA technology for the detection of antibodies (e.g. 6H4, 1E4) that can be present in the cell cultures. Some of these tests may also need to be applied to culture reagents of animal origin, and any testing performed by the manufacturer should be carefully evaluated before accepting the reagents for use.",
