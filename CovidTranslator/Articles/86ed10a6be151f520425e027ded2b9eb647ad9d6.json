Selective exchange of macromolecules between the two compartments is mediated by proteins of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Receptor proteins of the karyopherin family interact with NPC components and transfer their cargos between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways are regulated at multiple levels by modulating the expression or function of individual cargoes, transport receptors, or the transport channel. The regulatory levels have increasingly broad effects on the transport pathways and affect a wide range of pro cesses from gene expression to development and differentiation.",

The spatial separation provides the cell with additional opportunities to finely regulate the processes and, on the other hand, requires the highly selective exchange of many macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Exchange is due to a variety of receptor transport proteins, which interact with components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to transport bound proteins between the two compartments. Each of the receptors is involved in its specific transport pathway, transferring a certain set of substrates (cargoes). The state of a substrate also plays an important role in the transfer, since a cargo must have necessary signal sequences to properly bind to its receptor. The major ity of cell signaling pathways are involved in signal transduction between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Thus, detailed knowledge of the organization and reg ulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport is essential for the understanding of cell metabolism and functional activity.",

An NLS often has a consensus sequence of several positively charged amino acid residues. Such sequences were found in the NLSs of histones, riboso mal proteins, and certain RNA binding proteins. In some cases, a minimal functional NLS is rather large. For instance, the M9 NLS consists of 38 amino acid residues, is enriched in glycine, and includes only a few positively charged residues. Even longer NLSs are known, indicating that a certain spatial structure of the karyopherin binding region plays an important role in complex formation [16] . Karyopherins that mediate nuclear export recognize NESs [9, 11] . Minimal func tional NESs have been identified for several proteins. A moderately conserved short motif with three or four hydrophobic amino acid residues (LPPLERLTL in the Rev NES) has been studied in most detail to date. This NES is utilized in all eukaryotes and serves as a binding site for the karyopherin Crm1. The NES was found in at least 75 proteins, including many tran scription factors, cell cycle regulators, and virus pro teins, such as Rev and proteinase K inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1), where this signal was identified for the first time.

In higher eukaryotes, exportin 5 trans fers microRNA precursors from the nucleus upon recognizing their hairpin structure with a protruding 3' end [22] .",

Two proteins (human importin 15 and yeast Msn5p) are exceptions, having both exporting and importing activities. Known importins are more numerous than exportins.

Importins bind with RanGTP with high affinity, and the target protein is consequently released from its complex with an importin. Exportins, whose function requires the formation of a ternary complex with RanGTP and a cargo, have low affinity for RanGTP when not bound with a target protein [9, 11] . A study of the atomic structure for the complexes of importin \u03b21 and karyopherin \u03b22 with RanGTP showed that RanGTP binds similarly with both receptors. RanGTP interacts with a concave on the N terminal arch of importins, and its binding site has two spatially separate domains, one being closer to the N end of the arch, and the other closer to its C end [26] . The C terminal domain that contacts RanGTP is a negatively charged loop between two HEAT domains. The same loop was found to bind with proteins transported by karyo pherin \u03b22. This circumstance may explain why the target protein is released from its complex with impor tin once transferred into the nucleus (and in contact with RanGTP). Mutations of the C terminal RanGTP binding domain result in a loss of the asso ciation between karyopherin binding with RanGTP and the release of a cargo. Thus, a contact of RanGTP with this region may regulate the formation of the importin-cargo complex [23] .",

Cse1p forms a superhelix with N and C terminal arches, which clamp around RanGTP on both sides. Simulta neously, Cse1p binds with karyopherin \u03b1 and fixes it in a conformation that prevents cargo binding. Karyo pherin \u03b1 also forms bonds with RanGTP in this com plex. A feature of Cse1p-RanGTP interaction is that the N terminal arch alone can form a weak bond with RanGTP, but the complex becomes sufficiently stable only when RanGTP binds with both N and C termi nal arches, which is conformationally possible only when Cse1p is bound with cargo. The resulting ternary complex resembles a tight spring, which stretches in the cytoplasm upon RanGTP hydrolysis to release the cargo karyopherin \u03b1 [27] . The exportin Crm1 is similar in several structural features to karyopherin \u03b22. Like the C terminal RanGTP binding site of karypherin \u03b22, Crm1 has a flexible loop in the middle of the polypeptide chain. The domain is thought to shield the binding site for target proteins and, simultaneously, to prevent Crm1 from forming a stable complex with RanGTP. How ever, when Crm1 binds with a target protein or RanGTP, the loop changes its position and stimulates the formation of a stable ternary complex. It is possible that conformational changes of a flexible loop underlie a general mechanism of the formation and dissocia tion of transport complexes [28] . At the same time, the exportin Cse1p lacks regions similar to the Crm1 flexi ble loop, indicating that the mechanism is not univer sal [27] .",

Re import of Ran is due to NTF2. NTF2 interacts with RanGDP, which is the main cytoplasmic form of Ran. The NTF2-RanGDP complex is transferred into the nucleus, which is due to the ability of NTF2 to interact with low affinity with FG containing Nup proteins, as karyopherins do. The RanGDP transfer is unidirec tional because RanGDP is rapidly converted to RanGTP on the nuclear surface of the NPC.

RanGTP hydrolysis occurs in the cyto plasm, since RanGAP is too large to enter the nucleus through the NPC. RanGAP can be sumoylated (covalently bound with a protein of the SUMO family), and the resulting form has affinity for cyto plasmic Nup358 [40] . RanBP1 is small enough to enter the nucleus through the NPC via diffusion. However, RanBP1 has a NES recognizable by the exportin Crm1, which ensures continuous active export of RanBP1 appearing in the nucleus via diffu sion into the cytoplasm.",

It should be noted, however, that the eukaryotic cell has several accessory factors that affect the transport efficiency. For instance, the effi ciency of karyopherin \u03b1 dependent nuclear import is improved upon Npap60 binding, which increases karyopherin \u03b1 affinity for importin \u03b21. Appearing in the nucleus, the Npap60-importin \u03b21-karyopherin \u03b1-NLS cargo complex is affected by RanGTP and CAS, which acts as an exportin to recycle karyopherin \u03b1 into the cytoplasm. The import complex is cleaved into two complexes, Npap60-importin \u03b21-RanGTP and CAS-karyopherin \u03b1-RanGTP. A feature of the Npap60 effect is that Npap60 differently binds with importin \u03b21 during import. It is thought that Npap60 has a structure of a tri stable switch [41] . RanBP3, which is a Npap60 analog involved in export, is struc turally similar to Npap60 and binds with the exportin Crm1 to increase its affinity for RanGTP and NES containing proteins, thus improving the efficiency of Crm1 dependent export [42] .",

Modification of signal molecules via phosphorylation or dephosphory lation, which is the most clearly understood mecha nism regulating nuclear transport, may involve many kinases and phosphatases [61] . Kinases and phos phatases are regulated by many cell signals, directly linking external signaling factors and intracellular sig nals with changes in the nuclear import or export of signal molecules, such as cell cycle regulators, kinases, and transcription factors. Many of these proteins have both NES and NLS, which allow a fine regulation of their intracellular localization by changing the effi ciency of nuclear export or import [62] .",

Importin \u03b13 is absent in early embryo development, and, consequently, dHSF does not enter the nucleus [84] .",
