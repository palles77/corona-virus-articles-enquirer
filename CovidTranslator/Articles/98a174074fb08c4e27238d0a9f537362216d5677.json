It is important for clinicians to consider this before allowing their patients to embark on a long voyage without supplemental oxygen. See the section below \"Supplemental Oxygen during Air Travel.\" It is interesting to note that some of the next generation passenger aircraft, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, are able to operate at the lower cabin altitude of 6000 ft due to the extensive use of composite materials in the fuselage, which are able to tolerate the higher pressurization.",

Depending on the type of aircraft, about half of the cabin air is recirculated. The other half is fresh air that is supplied by engine compressors, cooled by air-conditioning packs, and then blended with recirculated air. As a reference point, an office building may recirculate between 65 and 95% of its air. Older aircraft such as the Boeing 727 and McDonald-Douglas DC-9 do not recirculate air. It is only with the fuel crisis in the 1970s that modifications were made to newer aircraft to decrease the amount of fresh air brought into the cabin by the engines, thereby decreasing fuel consumption. It is of note that the fresh air brought into the cabin is virtually sterile. Despite these modifications to newer aircraft, cabin air is exchanged in its entirety quite frequently. Consider the Boeing 767 used in both domestic and long-haul international versions. The cabin air is exchanged entirely every 2-3 minutes. Thus cabin air is exchanged approximately 20-30 times per hour. Compare that with the average household, which exchanges its volume only about five times per hour.",

The low humidity is caused by the frequent renewal of cabin air with outside air. With outside air temperatures being well below 0\u00b0 F (\u221218\u00b0 C), little appreciable moisture or heat is brought into the cabin. Air bled off the engines must be circulated and warmed to bring it to a comfortable range.

Some individuals are contagious before overt symptoms are manifested and recognized. (See further considerations in the section below entitled \"The Air Carrier Access Act 1986.\") When a contagious source passenger is identified, usually days after the flight has been completed, public health authorities and the airline carrier must work together to notify and screen all passengers who traveled with the source passenger and have been assessed to be at risk of exposure. It is important to document the level of infectiousness of the source passenger. In the case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, factors such as anatomic involvement, positive acid-fast bacilli smears, history of transmission, and prior treatment of the source case must be considered. Further, the proximity to the source case and duration of exposure all figure into the post-exposure notification algorithm. Literature clearly reflects that proximity to the source case is one of the most important variables in the transmission of infectious disease. Thus, a passenger traveling in first class need not necessarily be notified of a source case seated in the rear of the aircraft in the coach section. Similarly, those whose exposure was limited to less than 8 hours are very unlikely to need notification.",

However, US public health agencies led by the CDC have taken a more active role and now may require airlines to release electronic passenger data by issuing a Directive Order in the event of a confirmed possible exposure in-flight. In addition, there is now a requirement for the commander of an aircraft destined for a US airport to report immediately to the nearest CDC Quarantine Station any death or illness among passengers or crew, prior to arrival.

Although it is not easily transmitted to humans, more than 500 human cases have been reported since 2003 in parts of Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, with a case mortality rate of about 60%. Transmission of avian flu H5N1to humans usually involves direct contact with infected birds, but if the virus mutates and becomes more easily spread from human to human (e.g., airborne by the respiratory route), this could start an influenza pandemic or worldwide outbreak of disease. Avian influenza H7N9 virus continues to cause severe outbreaks of disease on poultry farms in China, in other Asian countries, and in the US. So far, human cases reported from Asia have not led to sustained human-to-human transmission. Considering the possibility of an avian flu pandemic in the future, IATA in cooperation with the CDC developed guidelines for airline personnel meeting passengers arriving from known outbreak areas, as well as for airline cleaning and maintenance crews who may potentially be exposed. All guidelines emphasize basic hygiene practices to prevent becoming ill, such as hand washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand gel, separation of any ill passengers and providing them with a surgical mask or tissues to cover the mouth and nose, use of disposable gloves when handling blood or body fluids, and prompt reporting of the illness to public health authorities. Specialized personal protective equipment such as respirators or gowns is not recommended except in direct patient-care situations, although the use of surgical masks when around symptomatic individuals in public areas may be considered. Specialized passenger screening techniques such as thermal screening to identify febrile passengers when pre-boarding that were utilized during the SARS epidemic in some international locations are not being recommended at this time.",

In one limited report, 462 injuries caused by objects falling from overhead bins were reported in a 3-year period; >90% were head injuries to passengers seated in aisle seats. In a 10-year retrospective study of turbulencerelated injuries among airline cabin crew, about one-half involved serious injuries, with the most frequent type being lower extremity fractures, especially the ankle. The conundrum is that sitting in an aisle seat and ambulating in the airplane aisle are recommended for prevention of VTE in passengers, but the risk of turbulence-related injuries could be lowered by sitting in a window seat and being restrained by a seat belt as much as possible.",

Although medical events during flight are reported, the information was not collected in a standardized format, and it is difficult to compare data across carriers and regions. Two recently published retrospective studies of in-flight medical emergencies show that most cases were related to syncope, respiratory symptoms, or gastrointestinal symptoms, but potential cardiac symptoms such as chest pain were most often associated with diversion of the flight.",

It has been suggested that volunteer physicians or other medically qualified volunteers (e.g., emergency department nurse, advanced nurse practitioner, or advanced paramedic) responding to an in-flight medical incident stay within the scope of their training and practice, request access to the on-board emergency medical kit, and coordinate their efforts with the flight crew and remote response/call center physician (if available).",
