In this study, four full-length bat AAV capsid genes were isolated in China, with their amino acid sequences sharing 61% identity with those of AAV2 on average. These capsid genes could package AAV particles in combination with AAV2 rep and ITRs, albeit at a lower efficiency. Bat AAVs could only slightly infect mouse liver but could transduce mouse muscle to some extent after systemic administration with a higher muscle/liver ratio than that of primate AAVs. Bat AAV 10HB showed moderate muscle transduction, similar to that of AAV2, during direct intramuscular injection and, compared with other AAV serotypes, was also relatively efficient in resisting human antibody neutralization after intramuscular injection. Evolutionary analysis revealed a number of codons in bat AAV capsid genes subject to positive selection, with sites corresponding to V259 and N691 in 10HB capsids being localized on the surface of the AAV2 capsid. Mutagenesis studies indicated that the positive selection in bat AAV capsids is driven by their tropism evolution in host species. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that bat AAV 10HB vector has the possible applications for muscular gene therapy, especially in the presence of human AAV neutralizing antibodies.",

The bat intestinal tissues were collected from Yunnan in 2007. Viral nucleic acid was extracted from the fecal samples with a QIAamp RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. These RNA samples have been used for epidemiological studies on RNA viruses. However, since bat genomic DNA was detected from them, they were also used for amplification of AAV capsid genes in this study. Viral DNA was also directly isolated from the intestinal samples using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). A set of primers was selected from the bat AAV Yunnan strain genomic sequence (GenBank no. GU226971) published previously: Bt-CAP5\u2032 (5\u2032-CCCAAGCTTCGGGGGAATCTGACTCCGTGA ACTTCGCCGAGA-3\u2032) and Bt-CAP3\u2032 (5\u2032-GGAAGATCTC GCAGAGACCAAAGTTCAACTGAAACGA-3\u2032). These primers were used to amplify the complete capsid gene from different bat AAV fecal samples. A 2.5-kb PCR product was obtained, treated successively with BglII, Klenow fragment, and HindIII and inserted into the UF1-AAV8 vector treated successively with NotI, Klenow fragment, and HindIII. The UF1-AAV8 vector contains the AAV2 rep gene and ITR sequences and was used for cloning shuffled AAV capsid genes [18] . This bat AAV capsid gene was designated 07YN considering its sampling from Yunan in 2007. To adapt the PCR to more bat DNA samples, a degenerate primer dCAP3\u2032 was designed based on alignment of the 3\u2032 untranslated region of mammalian AAV genomes (5\u2032-GGAAGATCTACTGA-MACGAAT(H/-)AMMCGGTTTATTG-3\u2032, modified from Bello et al. [19] . By the use of the Bt-CAP5\u2032/dCAP3\u2032 primers, two additional bat AAV capsid gene sequences were amplified from bat fecal samples and cloned into the UF1-AAV8 vector. The sequences were designated 09YN and 10HB according to their sampling time and regions. Furthermore, a Bt-CAP3\u2032-N1 primer was selected from the downstream sequence of the 07YN capsid gene obtained by 3\u2032 rapid amplification of genomic DNA ends (RAGE; data not shown): (5\u2032-GGAA-GATCTACGCGAGAGACCGGACTTGACTGAAACGAA-3\u2032). A fourth bat AAV capsid gene was amplified from the Myotis ricketti intestinal DNA sample using Bt-CAP5\u2032/Bt-CAP3\u2032-N1 primers and designated as 1285 according to the bat code. The 09YN, 10HB, and 1285 capsid genes were cloned into the UF1-07YN plasmid using HindIII/BglII digestion to generate UF1-09YN, UF1-10HB, and UF1-1285, respectively. All bat AAV capsid genes were sequenced using the ABI automated sequencer.",

Furthermore, positive selection could occur episodically in the specific dependovirus capsid gene lineage. The branch-site test implemented in CODEML and mixed effects model of evolution implemented in MEME [31] allow selection pressure to vary both among protein sites and across tree branches. These methods were used for detection of episodic diversifying selection across bat AAV lineages. Conditions existed in which an identical serine residue was observed through all of the gene lineages and was detected as positively selected by the programs.

However, after IVIG treatment, the AAV2 transduction in the mouse muscle decreased to approximately one-sixth of the untreated control, and the transduction of 09YN and 10HB, respectively, decreased to approximately one second and one-third of the untreated controls. The 10HB subsequently had the muscle transduction efficiency similar to that of the AAV2.

By contrast, the transgene expression from the 10HB vector was reduced to 14.4% of the level produced in the absence of IVIG, with absolute luciferase activity over 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 RLU/mg protein.

            "text": "In accordance with the condition in primate AAVs [3] , a number of recombination events were detected among ) . However, no recombination event was detected during the evolution of the four bat AAV capsid genes. Since recombination could interfere with the detection of positive selection [28] , the dependovirus capsid sequence alignment was partitioned into 10 segments according to the detected recombination breakpoints. These sequence segments were then subjected to selection analysis using the branch-site test in the PAML program [30] or the MEME method in the HYPHY program [31] . With respect to the branch site test, two sites corresponding to S238 and M420 in the 09YN capsid were subject to positive selection in the whole bat AAV lineage; one site corresponding to N344 in the 09YN capsid was selected within the 07YN/ 09YN/1285 lineage; and four sites corresponding to Q213, R297, A422, and M664 sites in the 10HB capsid were selected in the 10HB branch (Table 3) . Interestingly, the results from the MEME analysis differed partially from those obtained from the branch-site test. The site corresponding to S238 in the 09YN capsid was positively selected for the whole bat AAV lineage, and the three sites corresponding to T259, N344, and E694 in the 09YN capsid were selected for the 07YN/09YN/1285 lineage. The site corresponding to S214 in the 10HB capsid was selected for the 10HB branch. These results suggest that positive selection but not genetic recombination play the crucial role in the speciation of bat AAV variants. For a better comprehension of their functional roles, the positively selected sites of bat AAVs were projected onto the AAV2 structure [34] . All three bat AAV sites from the 10HB branch were projected onto the interior surface of the AAV2 capsids (data not shown). The sites corresponded to Q213, S214, and R297 in the 10HB capsid and N223, S224 and K309 in the AAV2 capsid. By contrast, both bat AAV sites from 07YN/09YN/1285 lineage were projected onto the exterior surface of the AAV2 capsids (Fig. 5) . The sites corresponded to T259 and E694 in the 09YN capsid, V259 and N691 in the 10HB capsid, and H271 and N705 in the AAV2 capsid. Unfortunately, no functional information is currently available for the three bat AAV sites localized on the interior surface of AAV2 capsids. However, mutations of H271 and N705, two projected sites on the exterior surface of AAV2 capsids, were associated with the altered transduction or neutralization properties of AAV2 [35] . Fig. 4 Maximum-likelihood phylogeny based on coding sequences of vertebrate dependovirus capsid genes. The tree topology was estimated using the DNAML program in the PHYLIP package [29] Thus, it was plausible that positive selection within the corresponding sites in bat AAVs was related to their adaptation to uncharacterized bat species. To test this hypothesis, it would be interesting to perform mutagenesis experiments on the bat AAV 10HB capsid gene to examine their effects in muscle transduction in mice. The 10HB variant was selected because of its moderate muscle transduction and effective evasion of antibody neutralization (Figs. 2and 3) . The evolutionary pathway of the V259 site in the 10HB capsid (corresponding to T259 in the 09YN capsid and H271 in the AAV2 capsid) is demonstrated in Fig. 6a . Positive selection was detected in two dependovirus lineages with this codon being mutated from T to H in the AAV1/AAV6 lineage and from V to T in the bat AAV 07YN/1285/09YN lineage. Moreover, the evolutionary pathway of the N691 site in the 10HB capsid (corresponding to the E694 site in the 09YN capsid and the N705 site in the AAV2 capsid) is demonstrated in Fig. 6b . This codon was replaced from the ancestral N to E in bat AAV 07YN/1285/09YN lineage and AAV7, to K in AAV4, to A in bovine AAV and AAV1/AAV6 lineage, and to S in rat AAV.",

Moreover, when the six bat AAV 10HB mutants were compared side-by-side with the wild-type 10HB virus, they showed variable transduction properties in mouse muscle. The transduction of 10HB V259T and V259H fell to approximately one-seventieth and one-fortieth of that of wild-type 10HB, respectively (Fig. 7a) . This result was consistent with previous observations of AAV2 vector with mutations at the orthologous H271 site [35] . However, mutations at the N691 site within the 10HB capsid only slightly reduced the muscle transduction of the 10HB vector, which was also in keeping with the results in the AAV2 vector with mutations at the orthologous N705 site. Intriguingly, the 10HB V259H and V259T mutants showed only slightly reduced AAV genome copy numbers in mouse muscle (Fig. 7b) . Furthermore, the 10HB mutants N691A, N691K, and N691S exhibited highly similar vector genome copies to those of the wild-type 10HB vector.

The 07YN, 1285, and 09YN were sampled from the same location in Yunnan Province at different times. Consequently, the variants showed only a limited number of sequence variations among one another. Specifically, 1285 capsid differed from the 07YN capsid by three amino acid residues, while 09YN capsid differed from 07YN by seven amino acid replacements (Fig. 1 ). By contrast, the 10HB capsid from Hubei Province differed from 07YN by 132 residues. These results inferred that the genetic diversity of the bat AAV capsid gene was dictated by the geographic distribution of the original bat populations. Furthermore, the bats might be an important source for the isolation of novel AAV serotypes because the four AAV variants were isolated from a limited number of bat samples and because AAV sequences were highly prevalent in bat samples from different regions of China [17] . The bat AAV capsids showed~60% sequence identity with that of AAV2 (Table 1) , which demonstrated the distinct biological properties of bat and primate AAVs. In another aspect, the bat AAV capsid genes could be used in combination with the AAV2 rep gene and ITR sequences to generate recombinant AAV particles, albeit with the lower titers, which suggested a structural and functional conservation of AAV capsid genes across a large number of dependovirus species.",

Intriguingly, the bat AAVs could not efficiently infect the human cell lines (data not shown), which might be attributable to their high sequence variation from human AAVs and a potential interspecies barrier for transmission of bat AAV to human populations. Furthermore, when used for systemic administration, the bat AAVs could not transduce most of the organs including the liver in mice, but the 1285 vector could persist in the kidney and spleen for at least 14 days without significant transduction (Fig. 2a, b) . This unique property of 1285 inferred that its capsids retained high stability in mouse tissues without efficient capsid uncoating and transgene expression. Furthermore, the bat AAV 10 HB vector could moderately transduce the mouse muscle after intramuscular injection, exhibiting the efficiency comparable to that of AAV2 (Fig. 2d, e) . Notably, the muscle versus liver ratio of transgene expression for bat AAVs was over 24 times higher than that of AAV2 and AAV8. This characteristic of bat AAVs might favor their further genetic modification for gene vehicles specifically targeting to mouse skeletal muscle.",

Significantly, the bat AAV10HB vector could still efficiently transduce the skeletal muscle in a high dose of IVIG after intramuscular injection in mice, which was in contrast to the complete loss of transgene expression from the AAV2 vector at the same antibody titer. Considering both its moderate transduction of mouse muscle and efficient evasion of human antibody neutralization, the bat AAV 10HB vector exhibited the potential to be used for muscular gene therapy in humans.",

However, little is known about their evolutionary mechanism. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a limited number of recombination events among dependovirus species (data not shown), distinct from the frequent occurrence of homologous recombination in primate AAVs [3] . Furthermore, a number of positively selected sites were detected during the speciation of bat AAVs (Table 3 ; Fig. 5 ). Mutagenesis experiments of two of these selected sites in the 10HB capsid gene supported their functional roles in mouse muscle transduction (Fig. 7) . These mutations appeared to affect muscle transduction of the 10HB vector primarily by lowering their intracellular trafficking or virion uncoating with no significant alteration of the tissue distribution of the vector genome. Interestingly, mutation of the N705 site in the AAV2 capsid, which is orthologous to N691 in the 10HB capsid altered its neutralization property [35] . Thus, positive selection in bat AAV capsid genes might be driven spontaneously by selection pressure from infection and immunity similar to that occurring in canine parvovirus [36] .",

However, from another perspective, the bats could also be a potential source for virus isolation and vector development. Novel AAV vectors have also been isolated from other nonprimate mammals including cattle, goats, and pigs [11] [12] [13] . A common attribute of these AAV vectors was their efficient evasion of preexisting immunity from human AAV antibodies. Unfortunately, these vectors might not be superior to primate AAVs in their transduction properties, and to the best of our knowledge, no reports have described their further genetic engineering. Ideally, these vectors could be further tailored to optimize their transduction and immunological properties [37] , which could ultimately benefit their application to human gene therapy.",

            "text": "Selection pressure and evolutionary pathway for sites 259 (a) and 691 (b) of the bat AAV 10HB capsid gene. The full-length dependovirus capsid coding sequences were subjected to recombination analysis to be split into segments without recombination. Segments 2290-2535 (a) and 6766-7074 (b) were used for MEME analysis[31]. Branches are colored according to the magnitude of the empirical Bayes factor (EBF) for the event of positive selection: redevidence for positive selection, teal-evidence for neutral evolution or negative selection, black-no information. The amino acid residue for each branch was demonstrated at the root, and the replacements inferred as positive selection were displayed on top of or adjacent to Muscle transduction by bat AAV 10HB mutants at the selected sites 259 and 691. A total of 10 10 vector genomes of AAV2, wild-type or mutated bat AAV 10HB vectors as indicated were intramuscularly injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of adult C57B/6 mice, and luciferase activity (a) and rAAV vector genome copies (b) were detected 14 days after treatment. The data are mean values \u00b1 s.e. P-values from the unpaired two-tailed t-test are shown above the bars trafficking of the 10HB vector in mouse muscle, which determined their severely reduced transgene expression.",
