While numerous publications deal with the design and the optimization of corresponding upstream processes, one-to-one comparisons of these cell lines under comparable cultivation conditions have largely been neglected. Therefore, a direct comparison of influenza virus production with adherent MDCK and Vero cells in T-flasks, roller bottles, and lab-scale bioreactors was performed in this study. First, virus seeds had to be adapted to Vero cells by multiple passages. Glycan analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein showed that for influenza A/PR/8/34 H1N1, three passages were sufficient to achieve a stable new N-glycan fingerprint, higher yields, and a faster increase to maximum HA titers. Compared to MDCK cells, virus production in serum-free medium with Vero cells was highly sensitive to trypsin concentration. Virus stability at 37\u00b0C for different virus strains showed differences depending on medium, virus strain, and cell line. After careful adjustment of corresponding parameters, comparable productivity was obtained with both host cell lines in small-scale cultivation systems. However, using these cultivation conditions in lab-scale bioreactors (stirred tank, wave bioreactor) resulted in lower productivities for Vero cells.",

Each cell line shows its specificities, and its use for vaccine production has advantages but also disadvantages compared to the other cell lines. Based on a thorough understanding of the pros and cons of individual host cells for process performance, properties of other cell lines, specific aspects of virus-host cell interaction and process options can be better evaluated. Overall, a thorough comparison of cell lines might help to develop process optimization strategies, as well as to assess quality differences concerning the virus strains and antigens produced.",

In particular, growth and influenza virus replication in adherently growing MDCK and Vero cells has been investigated (Rimmelzwaan et al. 1998; Merten et al. 1999a, b; Nicolson et al. 2005) . However, a direct comparison of experimental data for these two cell lines, i.e., an identification of the cell line resulting in optimum process performance, is not straight forward. On one side, cell and virus propagation were investigated in different cultivation systems (static systems, roller bottles, spinner, stirred tank). On the other side, not only different media (serum-containing (SC) as well as serum-free (SF)) but also different microcarriers (Cytodex 1 and 3) were used for large-scale cultures (Merten et al. 1996; Quesney et al. 2001; Kistner et al. 2007; Pereira 1998, 1995) . Additional variations resulted from the use of MDCK as well as Vero cell lines from different sources and the use of different influenza virus strains ). And, even when similar cultivation conditions are chosen, differences in productivity as well as product quality are to be expected, as for example, Vero cells are known to be deficient in \u03b2-interferon response due to the absence of the \u03b2-interferon gene (Mosca 1986; Desmyter et al. 1968 ). Typically, cell lines from two different hosts will also show variations in the glycosylation machinery, metabolism, enzyme activities, and proteome levels (Ritter et al. 2008; Schwarzer et al. 2009 ).",

For MDCK cells, the release of a trypsin inhibitor has also been described recently (Nishiyama et al. 2008 ). However, influenza virus replication has not been found to be as sensitive to trypsin concentration as in Vero cells, and trypsin is usually added at time of infection only (Tree et al. 2001; Genzel et al. 2004 Genzel et al. , 2006a Schwartz et al. 2006 ).

Monitoring of specific analytical data for this process allowed a thorough evaluation of the corresponding production systems (Schwarzer et al. 2009; Vester et al. 2009; Schulze-Horsel et al. 2009; Kalbfuss et al. 2007) .

N-glycan fingerprints of the HA protein fraction from influenza A/PR/8/34 (NIBSC) were monitored during this adaptation process. As expected, N-glycan fingerprints of the produced HA proteins were different for MDCK and Vero cells. After the first adaptation step, the N-glycan fingerprint changed (Fig. 1) , and stabilized after adaptation step three indicating that the three steps were sufficient for successful matching this virus to the new host cell. Three adaptation steps were also enough to obtain similar virus yields and infection time profiles in Vero cells compared to MDCK cells.",

As the stability of virus can clearly influence the virus titer, the stability of two virus variants from human influenza A/PR/8/34 H1N1 (supplied by NIBSC and RKI), produced either in MDCK cells or in Vero cells, was tested. Therefore, virus was incubated in \u0394SC medium at 37\u00b0C for 11 days in RBs. When following the stability of equine influenza in MDCK cells under similar conditions in RBs, it was seen that the maximum HA titer was relatively constant whereas the TCID 50 decreased over time, and after 150 h, no infectious virus could be detected (Genzel et al. 2006a, b) . For the two different variants from human influenza A/PR/ 8/34, surprisingly, only for the NIBSC variant produced in MDCK cells, a similar decrease in the TCID 50 was found. After 184 h no more infectious virus could be detected (Fig. 4) . For the RKI variant produced in MDCK and Vero cells and for the NIBSC variant produced in Vero cells, clearly, higher stability could be seen. A titer of approximately 10 4.5 TCID 50 /ml remained after 11 days. Maximum peak titers were found at 18 h post infection (pi) for TCID 50 (for the RKI variant produced in Vero cells: 61 h pi) and between 40-97 h pi for HA ( Table 2) . As described earlier, for both RKI variants higher TCID 50 titers were found (10 7.9 TCID 50 /ml) compared to the NIBSC variants (Schulze-Horsel et al. 2009) . Surprisingly, the highest TCID 50 profile (RKI variant in Vero cells) resulted in a comparatively low HA profile (maximum 2.7 log HA units/ 100 \u03bcL).",

Previous findings comparing N-glycan fingerprints from different viruses grown in various cell lines showed specific HA N-glycan fingerprints for each virus-host cell line combination (Schwarzer et al. 2008 (Schwarzer et al. , 2009 . This is in agreement with the differences in HA fingerprints from MDCK and Vero cell-derived A/PR/8/34 H1N1 virus observed in this study. Changes in glycosylation between influenza B viruses grown in eggs or MDCK cells were described in detail by Chen et al. using Western blotting and sequence analysis of the HA1 protein (Chen et al. 2008) . For influenza A H3N2 the glycosylation patterns resulting from production in Vero or MDCK cells were compared by Romanova et al. by treatment with glycosidases and Western blotting (Romanova et al. 2003) . It was shown that H3N2-but not H1N1-viruses adapted to Vero cells could no longer infect chicken eggs or agglutinate chicken erythrocytes. However, in our study, no problem with HA determination was noticed for samples from the VCS cultivation using A/Wisconsin/67/2005 HGR H3N2. The authors concluded that changes in HA N-glycosylation are most likely linked to changes in the amino acid sequence. Changes of single amino acids were also found for the adaptation of coronaviruses to Vero cells at different temperatures (Shen et al. 2004 ). Overall, it seems that the interrelation between HA N-glycosylation pattern, RNA, and amino acid sequence has not yet been clearly understood and further studies in this respect should be performed. Based on our findings we assume that the changes in HA N-glycan fingerprints are mainly dependent on the host cell line.",

MDCK cells, but in particular Vero cells, release protease inhibitors into the cell culture medium affecting the activity of trypsin needed for virus infection Nishiyama et al. 2008) . Washing and medium exchange steps before infection could clearly reduce the activity of trypsin inhibitors, potentially counteracting successful virus replication. However, for a vaccine production process, these steps mean additional medium costs and increased contamination risks. On the other hand, too high trypsin activities in the virus production medium could result in cell detachment. Therefore, as was seen in this study, optimizing trypsin activity is essential. In particular, batch to batch variations of trypsin, media, and differences in shear stress of cultivation systems need to be considered. Increase in trypsin activity resulted in an earlier increase in HA titer in SF medium, while too low concentrations prevented successful virus replication. In SC medium, however, all trypsin concentrations tested resulted in similar HA profiles. Multiple additions of trypsin as described by Govorkova et al. (1995 Govorkova et al. ( , 1996 , did not result in improvement of HA titers. As this method would complicate largescale production processes, a single addition of trypsin at time of infection should be preferred.",

No infectious virions were detected 184 h pi, which was also seen for equine influenza in MDCK cells at 150 h pi (Genzel et al. 2006a, b) . All other virus strains tested in this study showed better stabilities. In SF medium with lower moi A/Wisconsin/67/ 2005 va HGR produced in Vero cells was most stable ( (Wressnigg et al. 2009 ). Here, all virus strains had a stable titer for the time frame shown, once the maximum titer of about 10 7 -10 8 virions/ml was reached. For influenza A/Neth/18/94 produced in MDCK cells Rimmelzwaan et al. also showed a decrease of TCID 50 and a stable HA titer over a time period of 144 h (Rimmelzwaan et al. 1998) .

The spreading of Vero cells onto Cytodex 1 microcarriers (2 g/L) was observed in detail by Mendon\u00e7a et al. (1999) . For inoculation they found an optimum cells-to-microcarrier ratio of eight cells per microcarrier leading to 1.6\u00d710 6 cells/ml after 7 days of cell growth in spinner flasks in SC medium. Cultivations in a 3.7 L stirred tank bioreactor resulted in 0.8\u00d710 6 cells/ml after 9 days in batch, and 2.1\u00d710 6 cells/ml after 12 days in perfusion mode (Mendonca and Pereira 1998) . Cultivation of Vero cells on Cytodex 1 at 3 g/L was shown by Quesney et al. (2003) . From a 4\u00d710 5 cells/ml starting concentration, 1.8\u00d710 6 cells/ml were obtained after 5 days. A study in spinner flasks showed that the optimal pH for attachment of Vero cells onto Cytodex 1 microcarriers was pH 7.1, and the use of serum-supported cell growth but not cell attachment (Ng et al. 1996) . Furthermore, continuous stirring at 40 rpm during the attachment phase was favored compared to intermittent stirring. For production of Japanese encephalitis virus in Vero cells using 3 g/L Cytodex 1 in a spinner flask resulted in a maximum cell concentration of 1.8\u00d710 6 cells/ml after 6 days in SF medium (Toriniwa and Komiya 2007) . The production of rabies virus with Vero cells was shown in VPSFM medium using Cytodex 1 microcarriers (3 g/L) in a 2 L stirred tank bioreactor by Rourou et al. (2007) . Here, a maximum cell concentration of 2.6\u00d710 6 cells/ml was reached after 3 days. Finally, Merten et al. compared MDCK and Vero cell growth for influenza infection in the SF medium MDSS2N (Merten et al. 1999a, b) . For Vero cells a maximum concentration of 3.1\u00d710 6 cells/ml was obtained after 5 days (Cytodex 1 microcarriers, 2.5 g/L).",

At small-scale, Vero cells produced similar or even higher virus titers than MDCK cells. But also conditions for lower titers were possible. Especially, medium and virus strain had a strong influence on the possible titers. For the production of A/Wisconsin/ 67/2005 HGR in SF medium, Vero cells showed higher virus titers than MDCK cells (HA as well as TCID 50 ) ( Table 2) . On the other hand, for the cultivation in 5 L stirred tank bioreactor in SC medium, Vero cells produced lower virus titers than MDCK cells. Nevertheless, titers above 2.6 log 10 HA units/100 \u03bcL are very reasonable. For the production of two different H5N1 influenza viruses in 30 or 100 L scale bioreactors, Kistner et al. used the Vero ATCC CCL81 cell line and virus adapted over four passages (Kistner et al. 2007) . With a moi of 0.001 and infection at 32\u00b0C, HA titers of 2.7-3.0 log 10 HA units/ 100 \u03bcL were obtained. Earlier, Kistner et al. showed for different virus strains a comparison between Vero-derived and egg-derived virus production. HA titers of 2.1-2.4 log 10 HA units/100 \u03bcL were typically obtained for Vero cells and all cultivations shown from a 1,200 L bioreactor reached HA titers of 2.4 log 10 HA units/100 \u03bcL (Kistner et al. 1998) .",

A clear difference was noticed for glutamate. Vero cells released glutamate constantly, whereas MDCK cells took up glutamate completely towards the end of the cell growth phase. Mendonca et al. described the metabolism of Vero cells in Leibovitz medium supplemented with 5% FCS and 2 mM glutamine in a stirred tank bioreactor cultivation (Mendonca and Pereira 1998) . Cell concentrations of 0.8\u00d710 6 cells/ml were reached in batch mode after 8 days of cultivation. They observed an uptake of lactate when galactose was used as a carbon source. Glutamine uptake and ammonia release was similar but changes in glutamate concentrations were not reported. The effect of ammonia and glutamine/glutamate on growth of Vero cells in DMEM medium was analyzed in detail by Huang et al. (2006) . During growth in medium without glutamine but containing glutamate and ammonia, ammonia was slightly taken up. No ammonia release was seen during growth in medium containing only glutamate or glutamate and asparagine. Only for growth in glutamine medium, ammonia release was found, which was similar to the release observed in this study. For the glutamatecontaining media Huang et al. also described an uptake of glutamate similar to what was found for MDCK cells in SC medium in this study. This medium, however, did not contain glutamine. It seems that Vero cells use glutamate to produce glutamine via the enzyme glutamine synthetase. However, if glutamine is added to the medium, glutamine is taken up preferably while glutamine synthetase activity is reduced. In this case, even a release of glutamate is possible. Work is in progress to use specific enzyme actvity assays (Janke et al. 2010) to characterize cultivations in different media, ie., media which do not contain glutamine. Details on metabolism of VPSFM/William's E medium in a stirred tank bioreactor performed under similar conditions as described in this study were also given by Quesney et al. (Quesney et al. 2003) . Compared to our results, glutamine uptake was clearly higher in VPSFM/William's E medium leading to a complete uptake after 4 days. Furthermore, also a release of glutamate was observed, which was explained by the authors as a transformation of glutamine to glutamate. Vero cells were also cultivated in VPSFM medium (4 mM gln) by Rourou et al. for rabies virus propagation (Rourou et al. 2007) . Although lower glucose starting concentrations were used, higher lactate levels were reached compared to both lab-scale cultivations in this study. In contrast to glucose, higher glutamine starting concentrations were used by Rourou et al., but lower ammonia release was observed. No glutamate data was given.",
