Automated web-based infectious disease surveillance technologies are available; however, human input is still needed to review, validate, and interpret these sources. In this study, entries captured by Public Health England's (PHE) manual event-based EI system were examined to inform future intelligence gathering activities. Methods: A descriptive analysis of unique events captured in a database between 2013 and 2017 was conducted. The top five diseases in terms of the number of entries were described in depth to determine the effectiveness of PHE's EI surveillance system compared to other sources. Results: Between 2013 and 2017, a total of 22 847 unique entries were added to the database. The top three initial and definitive information sources varied considerably by disease. Ebola entries dominated the database, making up 23.7% of the total, followed by Zika (11.8%), Middle East respiratory syndrome (6.7%), cholera (5.5%), and yellow fever and undiagnosed morbidity (both 3.3%). Initial reports of major outbreaks due to the top five disease agents were picked up through the manual system prior to being publicly reported by official sources. Conclusions: PHE's manual EI process quickly and accurately detected global public health threats at the earliest stages and allowed for monitoring of events as they evolved.",

Epidemic intelligence (EI) for emerging infections is the process of identifying key information on emerging infectious diseases, specific incidents, and outbreaks. The importance of EI is recognized globally, and it is central to the surveillance component of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) to protect the global community from public health risks and emergencies that cross international borders (WHO, 2005a) . EI generally integrates both indicator-based (collection of structured data through surveillance systems) and event-based (unstructured data from formal and informal sources) components in a single surveillance system (Paquet et al., 2006) . It can be based solely on event-based data, which is usually more valued as it has the ability to detect the earliest reports of events and undiagnosed diseases.",

Initial sources are often neither the original nor conclusive source of intelligence, and information contained may require validation before further reporting. In these cases a definitive source of the quoted information or intelligence is searched for. A definitive source is defined as either the original place the information was published (e.g., ministry of health press release or a media report of a ministry of health press conference where an official release has not been published) or the most authoritative or conclusive resource (e.g., the WHO, ministry of health website, or US CDC). Initial sources of information are recorded to determine the utility of actively monitoring certain resources, and to allow the SOP to be revised as appropriate following review.

EI activities first picked up local media reports describing an undiagnosed disease in Guinea on March 15, 2014, 8 days before the outbreak was officially acknowledged by the WHO on March 23. For the duration of the outbreak, the EI system was used to detect suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola in new areas of previously affected countries, or countries that had not reported a case associated with the outbreak. During the 2014-2016 outbreak, 30.7% of initial sources came from NOR and other official resources. Media was the top definitive source (40.6%), as NOR communications were often limited or poor/slow. These media reports usually contained validated information from authorities that was not published elsewhere. Information on the latest epidemiology was closely monitored and used to inform assessments of the risk the outbreak presented to the UK population.",

The fact that the top three sources varied considerably by disease demonstrates the importance of monitoring a variety of different sources. The increased demand for epidemic intelligence during major incidents by risk managers and other policy-makers can put a large strain on resources; however these systems are an essential component of evidence gathering to inform risk assessments, preparedness, guidance, and policy.

There are automated systems that use 'webcrawling' software to search for official reports, news, and rumours about infectious diseases, including outbreaks, around the world. They search in many languages and pull in information from specified sites. Although these 'collection' systems are used by large organizations such as the WHO and US CDC, what this type of automation struggles to do is turn the information gathered into usable intelligence. A wellknown example of the limitations of automated 'big data analysis' systems to provide accurate, usable information is Google Flu Trends (Lazer et al., 2014) . These automated systems generate listings of hundreds/thousands of reports every day, even when specific search terms are utilized. This volume of information will contain a high degree of 'noise' (Khan et al., 2012; Barboza et al., 2014) . Generating usable intelligence requires additional processing and input including deduplication, translation, interpretation, and verification (Barboza et al., 2014; Fisichella et al., 2011) . This requires human analysts who, in addition, can compare the latest data with historical reports, monitor trends, determine what is worth reporting, and provide additional information, expert scientific opinion, and context. PHE's EI system utilizes publically available sources of information for the early detection of incidents of potential public health significance. As such, this system would be useful for countries and organizations without access to restricted systems, such as GPHIN and the Global Health Security Initiative Early Alerting and Reporting project. An internal analysis of PHE's system found that it is comparable to such systems in terms of timeliness and efficiency. PHE's EI system detected some largescale outbreaks prior to public acknowledgement of the outbreaks from the WHO, or at the same time, which led to improved governmental preparedness and response.",
