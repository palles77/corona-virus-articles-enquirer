We have developed a fluid array system using microsphere-conjugated molecular beacons and the flow cytometer for the specific, multiplexed detection of unlabelled nucleic acids in solution. For this array system, molecular beacons were conjugated with microspheres using a biotin-streptavidin linkage. A bridged conjugation method using streptavidin increased the signal-tonoise ratio, allowing for further discrimination of target quantitation. Using beads of different sizes and molecular beacons in two fluorophore colours, synthetic nucleic acid control sequences were specifically detected for three respiratory pathogens, including the SARS coronavirus in proof-of-concept experiments. Considering that routine flow cytometers are able to detect up to four fluorescent channels, this novel assay may allow for the specific multiplex detection of a nucleic acid panel in a single tube.",

            "text": "With the continual emergence of new pathogens, the differential diagnosis or identification of etiological agents is the important first step to control the spread of infection. The SARS coronavirus (SARS-hCoV) tested the ability of the scientific community to develop methods to isolate, identify and characterize an emerging virus (1, 2) . The most powerful etiological diagnostic was arguably the use of a microarray 'Viro-chip', which was able to quickly reveal that this pathogen was a coronavirus, even as it also found that this particular coronavirus had never been described previously (3) . It appears that this type of solid-phase array technology will become more routine as the costs decrease, the procedures become streamlined for practical use and the technology becomes better disseminated. Current tests for nucleic acid detection are based upon real-time PCR assays (4) . In these assays, non-specific (SYBR) or probe-specific fluorescence is measured throughout the PCR reaction [reviewed in (5) ].",

In this configuration, energy emitted by the excited fluorochrome is absorbed by the quencher and dissipated as heat in a process called fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). When the loop binds to a complementary nucleic acid strand, the molecule changes its conformation to distance the fluorochrome from the quencher, allowing unquenched fluorescence. These molecules were called 'molecular beacons' because they emit a fluorescent signal only when the probes are hybridized to their targets (6) . It was later shown that it was possible to build multiplexed assays with this method; differently labelled molecular beacons could recognize different targets in the same reaction tube (7) . It was also shown that the specificity of the assay was very high, so that probes differing in only 1 nt could be resolved (8) . Various assays were then published using the molecular beacons technology, ranging from mRNA in situ visualization (9,10) to nucleic acid sequence-based amplification detection (11) , and multiplex detection of four pathogenic retroviruses (12) . In other applications, molecular beacon probes were designed for use as DNA biosensors by binding molecular beacons to glass beads or cover slips (13) , ultra small optical fibre probes (14) and gold surfaces (15) , allowing the specific detection of complementary sequences.",

            "text": "In this report, we describe the construction of molecular beacon-conjugated beads that we have called 'BeadCons', whose specific hybridization with complementary target sequences can be resolved by flow cytometry (see Figure 1 ). Assay sensitivity is achieved through the concentration of fluorescence signal on discrete particles. We first obtained evidence that the method could work in principle, with the ability to detect single, synthetic target sequences. Then, we set up the system in a multiplex format (array), and applied the method to nucleic acid oligonucleotides mimicking respiratory diagnostic sequences. The results indicated that this method could allow the detection of the corresponding oligonucleotide, even when diluted in a complex mixture of nucleic acids. In fact, the versatility of flow cytometers allows the resolution of very complex analytical mixtures, in which the hybridized beads of a specific size and/or colour can be readily distinguished from the others that are unbound. The short assay time and ease-ofuse makes this method a good candidate for a further development of its diagnostic capabilities and use in the routine laboratory. Figure 1 . Schematic representation of the interaction of the bead-bound molecular beacon with a complementary nucleic acid. The molecular beacon contains a probing loop sequence embedded within complementary arm sequences. These arms form a hairpin stem that keeps a terminal fluorophore and a terminal quencher molecule in close proximity in the absence of nucleic acid that is complementary to the loop. This state allows for FRET, or a transfer of energy from the fluorophore to the quencher rather than excitation upon absorbance. After target addition, the complementary target forms a duplex with the loop portion of the beacon that pulls the fluorophore and quencher from close proximity, allowing fluorescence. The molecular beacon sequences are linked to the microspheres using a biotinylated thymidine in the stem sequence proximal to the quencher.",

A molar excess of biotinylated molecular beacon specific for HCV was added to 6.7 mm streptavidin-bound microspheres. It is important to note that the biotinylated thymidine in the molecular beacon is on the stem proximal to the quencher molecule as described previously (13) . Target DNA was then added to the washed beads to determine whether there was a shift in the mean fluorescence of the beads. An HCV-specific positive control DNA yielded an MFI of 27.0 -1.5 compared with an MFI of 2.06 -0.11 for an HIV target sequence (see Figure 2 ). Therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio (STNR) for the molecular beacons with a direct conjugation to the beads was 13.1, higher than the 2-5 STNR of other molecular beacon systems that use a solid or immobilized phase (18, 19) , but lower than the standard 25 STNR that is typically seen in solution (6,20,21). The commercial availability of biotinylated beads led us to test the possibility of using streptavidin to bridge the beacon and bead. Such an approach has previously been used to increase the signal of molecular beacons as functional biosensors (13) . Streptavidin was added to 6.7 mm biotinylated beads in excess to limit the possibility of bead cross-linking, with a high enough level of streptavidin so that no two beads would share a single streptavidin molecule. Initial experiments with lower streptavidin levels revealed the production of a doublet population, formed as a streptavidin molecule-bridged two biotinylated beads. When prepared and thoroughly washed beads were hybridized with the HCV-specific positive control DNA, an MFI of 49.8 -3.6 was seen compared with an MFI of 2.06 -0.15 for the unrelated HIV control. Therefore, an STNR of 24.1 was achieved through the use of a streptavidin bridge, comparable with the typical, optimized results in solution for this fluorophore/quencher set. An asymmetrical PCR product derived from an HCV-infected serum sample yielded an MFI of 14.1 -0.9, for an STNR of 6.8 (Supplementary Figure 1) . The reduction in STNR is probably due to self-annealing of the amplified asymmetric PCR strand; however, qualitative gating showed that the binding of the single-stranded product was much more effective than that of the symmetric PCR product (negative using the current hybridization conditions).",

Using this assay under initial conditions, a single nucleotide difference could not be statistically distinguished from the positive control sequence. The same experiment was repeated using a 5 min incubation at 80 C for hybridization, with or without the addition of 25 mM MgCl 2 . These hybridization conditions allowed a better resolution of nucleotide mismatches, although there was a small loss in the overall STNR in the assay (see Figure 4A ). Finally, the analysis was repeated using the SARS-N BeadCon. Using the new hybridization conditions (80 C with 25 mM MgCl 2 ), the single nucleotide mismatch for SARS-N generated a fluorescence that was 24% lower than the complementary positive control. A 3 nt mismatch showed a 91% loss of fluorescence compared with the positive control, at a level very similar to that of the complete mismatch oligo from HIV (see Figure 4B) .",

Unfortunately, the multiplex PCR system is complex for assay development, as primer/probe sets must be matched for primer melting temperature (T m ), probe T m , amplicon length and amplicon T m . Obviously, each additional target also adds another level of complexity to the assay when it comes to primer dimerization and mispriming. Microarrays will probably allow for the rapid screening of thousands of possible pathogens, but the cost, equipment and expertise make current routine use impossible, and this type of solid-phase array technology will not be practical as a clinical diagnostic for some years.

The commercial source of the beads that were used in these studies confirmed that the streptavidin beads carried three times as many binding sites for biotin as the biotinylated beads did for streptavidin. Therefore, if each streptavidin of the bridged molecule allows complete accessibility of all three available sites for biotin, the STNR should be roughly about the same. As the STNR was twice as high for the bridged molecule, it is likely that the bridging helps to overcome the surface effects that are often seen using solid state nucleic acid detection systems (19) .

It appears that currently designed methods for use in PCR must be modified if increased specificity is required. For the HCV BeadCon used in our studies at room temperature, a 3 nt mismatch was readily detectable at a level that was virtually indistinguishable from the matched positive control. As this reaction was hybridized and measured at room temperature, mismatched hybridization is expected as it is difficult to distinguish mismatches at temperatures below the 'window of discrimination' for each beacon (20, 22, 23) . In this temperature range, it is possible to discriminate a single nucleotide polymorphism; however, as the temperature decreases to 25 C, the difference in fluorescence between mismatched targets is negligible. The currently designed beacons are used to measure fluorescence at an elevated annealing temperature, which fails to allow mismatched target duplexes and, thus, fluorescence (20) . An assay that allows mismatching can be useful in detecting nucleic acids that have point mutations from their homologous sequence. Alternatively, the dynamics of the binding reaction could be altered by changing the Gibb's free energy assignments of the stem and loop regions of the molecular beacon. The SARS-N molecular beacon that we designed showed a better discrimination of mismatched targets, although it appears that the spacing of the mismatches may play a role. The binding properties can be modified by altering the backbone of the beacon (such as for a peptide nucleic acid), substituting high affinity nucleotides for normal ones (such as in a locked nucleic acid), or by changing the Figure 5 . Qualitative detection of three respiratory virus sequences in multiplex. A BeadCons array was generated using two bead sizes and two fluorescence markers as described in the text. The addition of PIV-3, RSV or SARS-h-CoV (genes M and N) DNA control sequences that were diluted in a complex DNA mixture allowed the specific identification of the target compared with negative controls. In effect, each panel shows an internal negative control, as each test was carried out using a complex DNA mixture. The black arrows note the positive shift in fluorescence. lengths or recognition portions of these sequences (24) . These types of molecular beacons will probably be used more in the future, as these complex synthesis technologies are improved and better diffused.",
