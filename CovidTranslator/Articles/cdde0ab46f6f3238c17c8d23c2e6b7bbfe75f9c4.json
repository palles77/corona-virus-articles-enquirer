            "text": "Etiology Colisepticemia in neonatal calves can be considered a disease of poor management. Failure of passive transfer is the primary risk factor for this disease. Colostral transfer of immunoglobulins may be compromised by short dry periods, preparturient leaking of colostrum, assumption that a calf has nursed colostrum just because it is left with the dam for 24 hours, primiparous heifers that have poorquality colostrum, and many other factors. Provision of an inadequate immunoglobulin mass can be a problem with both commercial colostrum substitutes or replacers as well as dam or farm sourced colostrum. In addition, poor maternity area and poor calf pen hygiene promote exposure of calves to the multitude of strains of E. coli capable of causing septicemia, the majority of which are commensal. Filthy conditions; calving areas that are dirty, wet, overcrowded, or overused; and failure to dip navels are additional factors that predispose to this problem. Sanitation and hygiene with respect to collecting, storing, and administering colostrum are important factors in the provision of adequate passive transfer and the prevention of colibacillosis.",

Because septicemic calves can shed large numbers of the organism before clinical signs are evident, contamination of communal pens and common-use feeding devices (e.g., esophageal feeding tubes) and direct contact with the infected calf or its feces or urine may promote spread of infection. Infected calves allowed to remain in the maternity area will amplify the level of environmental contamination, thereby placing other neonates born in that area at risk.

Age at onset can be valuable in the differentiation of ETEC infections because calves are most often within the first 72 to 96 hours of life with this condition and frequently less than 48 hours old. Furthermore, septicemic calves tend to be less dehydrated and have less watery diarrhea than calves with ETEC diarrhea; also, diarrhea tends to develop in the terminal stages of septicemia. Historical data may indicate other neonatal calves have recently shown similar signs or died at less than 2 weeks of age. Other differential diagnoses for acute colisepticemia include hypoxia or trauma during birth, simple hypothermia or hypoglycemia, septicemia caused by Salmonella spp., and congenital defects of the central nervous or cardiovascular systems. Polyarthritis caused by Mycoplasma spp. is an important differential diagnosis for septic arthritis secondary to colisepticemia but tends to be seen in considerably older calves. Salt poisoning, hypoglycemia, congenital neurologic disorders, traumatic injuries, and intoxications (e.g., lead) should be considered as differential diagnoses for meningitis secondary to colisepticemia. We have also seen several herds in recent years with young calves presenting with neurologic signs indistinguishable from meningitis for which the ultimate diagnosis was ionophore toxicity caused by overdosing before feeding milk replacer.

Although adequate levels of IgG do not rule out the disease, calves with IgG of 1600 mg/dL or more based on a single radial immunodiffusion test are highly unlikely to develop septicemic E. coli infection. Specific laboratory evaluation of immunoglobulin levels is preferable to field techniques when confirmation of FPT is essential but may not provide timely results for practitioners. Therefore, even though dehydration may falsely elevate blood protein levels, these field techniques may be useful. Adequate immunoglobulin levels are suggested by serum total protein of 5.5 g/dL or more in calves less than 7 days of age. The use of a Brix refractometer is a simple, inexpensive on-farm tool for the monitoring of neonatal dairy calf immunity levels. A plasma value of 10% or more can be used to classify calves with successful transfer of passive immunity. Other reports have found that using a Brix percentage of 8.5% or less had optimal sensitivity (100%) for detecting failure of adequate immunoglobulin transfer. Previous literature has suggested that serum \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity greater than 200 IU/L in 1 day old calves could be used as a cut-off point for adequacy of passive transfer. However, values for serum GGT can vary widely in healthy and sick calves and measurement of serum GGT should not be used as a gold standard in measuring colostral absorption. The development of visible turbidity in the 18% solution of sodium sulfite turbidity test is a reliable test for adequate passive transfer. A commercial turbidimetric assay (Midlands Bio-Products, Boone, IA) is available for on-farm determination of IgG concentration in serum samples from neonatal calves.",

Furthermore, antimicrobial sensitivity testing of blood culture isolates may aid in directing therapy, especially if a common etiologic cause is identified. Clinicians and producers should be aware of the differences between pathotypic strains of E. coli (e.g., ETEC) capable of producing severe disease in calves with adequate passive transfer and the everyday, commensal, and environmental E. coli often associated with sepsis caused by FPT.

Intravenous (IV) balanced electrolyte solutions should contain dextrose (2.5%-10%), and sodium bicarbonate (20-50 mEq/L) if the plasma bicarbonate concentration is (<10 mEq/L), to address hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis respectively. Adjustments of the concentration of dextrose and sodium bicarbonate in polyionic fluids can be guided by subsequent serum chemistry results. Maintaining normoglycemia in some peracute and acute septicemic calves can be extremely challenging due to consumption of administered glucose by bacteria. Antimicrobials used to treat neonatal septicemia should be bactericidal and possess a good gram-negative spectrum, such as ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, or ampicillin. Parenteral administration is necessary to achieve effective blood concentrations. Aminoglycosides such as gentamicin or amikacin can be used alone or in conjunction with the synergistically acting beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g., ceftiofur, penicillin, or ampicillin). Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to find E. coli cultured from blood or tissue of calves with septicemia resistant to ceftiofur, ampicillin and gentamicin. The use of potentially nephrotoxic aminoglycosides in a dehydrated patient with prerenal azotemia must be weighed against the potential bactericidal activity of the drugs. Given the present concerns regarding aminoglycoside use in food animals in the United States, use should be limited to situations in which other antibiotics have proven ineffective or in patients for which in vitro susceptibility testing has revealed an absence of approved, labeled alternatives. Furthermore, a minimum 18-month slaughter withdrawal must be enforced for calves that receive aminoglycosides. Use of fluoroquinolones (e.g., enrofloxacin, danofloxacin) and florfenicol in dairy calves is currently not permitted for anything other than respiratory disease under federal law in the United States.",

Although IgG 1 is the major immunoglobulin transferred, IgG 2 , IgM, and IgA are found as well. Resultant colostrum contains IgG at much higher concentrations than maternal serum, and transfer of maternal antibody into colostrum temporarily decreases maternal serum IgG 1 levels. Colostrum should be obtained as close to the time of calving as possible; colostrum collected more than 2 hours after calving shows a significant reduction in total IgG concentration. 2. A minimum of 40 dry days and a maximum of 90 dry days result in the best quality colostrum. 3. Assume dry cows that leak milk before parturition or collection of colostrum have lost the \"best\" colostrum. 4. Holstein calves must ingest at least 100 g of IgG 1 in the first 12 hours of life for adequate passive transfer of immunoglobulins. The immunoglobulin concentration in colostrum deemed \"acceptable\" ranges from 30 to 60 g IgG/L; obviously, if larger volumes of more dilute colostrum are fed, adequate immunoglobulin mass would then be provided. However, many dairy calves simply allowed to nurse dairy breed dams to satiety will not voluntarily ingest an adequate volume of colostrum to meet their required immunoglobulin intake. 5. Certain genetic lines of cattle may be prone to low immunoglobulin levels in colostrum. For example, beef cattle tend to have higher levels than Holsteins. This may reflect genetic selection or merely reflect the dilutional effects of the greater milk volume in dairy cattle. 6. A colostrometer (a hydrometer that measures specific gravity of fluid, thereby indirectly measuring solids and, it is hoped, immunoglobulin concentration) is a common on-farm tool used to assess colostrum quality. Colostrometer readings may be affected by the colostrum temperature; whereas higher temperatures underestimate quality, lower temperatures overestimate quality. Therefore, readings should be made when the colostrum is at room temperature (20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C). That aside, there is considerable overlap in specific gravity readings among colostrums with low and high immunoglobulin concentration. Previous recommendations state the hydrometer should have a colostrum specific gravity reading of 1.050 or greater at room temperature for adequate immunoglobulin levels. However, given the large number of variables that affect colostrum-specific gravity (e.g., protein concentration, lactation number, cow breed, and temperature), use of the 1.050 cutoff value will misclassify many (up to two thirds) poor-quality colostrums as acceptable. 7. Other measures of colostrum quality and immunoglobulin mass are being increasingly deployed on dairy farms. An alternative to the use of a colostrometer is indirect assessment of IgG concentration in colostrum by Brix refractometry. A Brix reading of 21% to 23% correlates with the target value of 50 g IgG/L, and colostrum with a Brix refractometer value less than 18% should be categorized as being of poor quality. Recent research suggests that Brixrefractometry is the most accurate way of identifying colostrum quality (at least in terms of IgG concentration) on farm. Direct measurement of colostrum IgG concentration is also possible using commercially available immunoassays. One of these cowside immunoassay kits (Colostrum bovine IgG quick test kit, Midlands Bio-Products, Boone, IA) has been demonstrated to identify poor-quality colostrums (those with IgG concentrations <50 g/L) with 93% specificity; in other words, this test appears to be superior to the hydrometer in accurately identifying poor-quality colostrum.",

By discarding (or feeding to older calves) Holstein colostrums that weigh more than 8.5 kg, a producer might increase the percentage of high-quality colostrum being fed to calves. Not surprisingly however, the weight or volume of colostrum is a less sensitive indicator of IgG content than other methods such as refractometry and so should only be relied on when other methods are unavailable. 9. Pooled colostrum from each cow's first milking may not ensure adequate immunoglobulin content because the poor-quality (dilute) colostrums tend to lower the immunoglobulin concentration of the entire pool. The practice of pooling colostrum also may increase Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), Salmonella Dublin and leukemia virus infection rates. 10.

            "text": "An increasing volume of data suggests that bacterial contamination of colostrum is a substantial problem on farm and that levels of bacteria in excess of 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL indicate a problem. Not only do high bacterial load colostrums represent an infectious disease risk, but there is also evidence that there is an increased risk of FPT when colostrum with such high levels of contamination is fed, likely linked to the binding of free IgG in the gut lumen by bacteria. The rapid proliferation or doubling time of bacteria at body temperature obligates producers to quickly refrigerate or freeze colostrum that is not to be immediately fed. Preservatives such as potassium sorbate can be added so as to increase safe storage time up to at least 96 hours at 4\u00b0C. If colostrum is not to be used within a few days, it should be frozen; more effective and rapid freezing, thereby curtailing bacterial growth, can be achieved by storage in 1-to 2-L bags rather than the conventional gallon jugs. Colostrum can become heavily contaminated with bacteria if good milking hygiene is not practiced at the first milking. Clean teats and udders, clean milking equipment, sanitized storage containers, and sanitized feeding equipment are necessary to limit the possibility of colostrum becoming a culture medium for pathogenic bacteria, including Salmonella spp. and virulent strains of E. coli. McGuirk and Collins have provided goals for bacterial contamination of colostrum: \u2022 Total bacteria: <100,000 colony forming units (CFU)/ml \u2022 Fecal coliforms: <10,000 CFU/ml \u2022 Other gram-negative bacteria: <50,000 CFU/ml \u2022 Streptococci (non-Streptococcus agalactiae): <50,000 CFU/ml \u2022 Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus: <50,000 CFU/ml Increasingly, larger farms are investing in the specialized equipment necessary for pasteurization of colostrum for the removal of infectious pathogens. Given the physical and chemical characteristics of colostrum, it is probable that careful quality control over time will be necessary to ensure that the pasteurization equipment is maintaining its efficacy. Initial data suggest that pasteurization, when performed properly, can be an excellent tool, increasing adequacy of passive transfer rates and reducing preweaning morbidity from diarrhea. 11. Springing heifers' colostrum has traditionally been considered lower quality than older cows. However, based on immunoglobulin concentration, colostrum from heifers is comparable with cows beginning their second lactation. In theory, the younger heifers have less immunologic \"experience\" than cows, so it is possible that the antibody \"spectrum\" (the number of different antigens to which antibodies are produced) is less in heifers than cows. However, the impact of this theoretical issue on calf health remains unproven. Until contrary data are made available, heifer colostrum should be evaluated and administered on the same basis as cow colostrum. Given this current summation of colostral quality research, the following recommendations are made for newborn dairy calves: 1. High-quality colostrum cleanly collected from Johne's disease-negative and BLV-negative cows may be stored for use. If not fed within 2 hours of milking, colostrum should be refrigerated in sanitized 1-or 2-L containers until fed; as mentioned earlier, use of larger containers may limit prompt cooling, thereby promoting bacterial overgrowth. Fresh colostrum may be refrigerated for no more than 1 week and frozen for up to 1 year. If frozen, thawing should be performed slowly in warm water. Microwave thawing, if done carefully, can be used to thaw colostrums without overheating and denaturation of colostral antibodies. However, if microwave thawing is used, thawing for short time periods, periodically pouring off the thawed liquid and using a rotating tray may help to limit overheating. 2. Calves should receive 4 L of high-quality first milking colostrum during the first 12 hours of life (3 L is often sufficient for Jerseys, Shorthorns, and Guernseys). The first 2 L should be fed within 1 to 2 hours after birth, and the second 2 L should be fed before 12 hours of life. Many operations have chosen to feed all 4 L by esophageal feeder in a single feeding to larger calves. 3. The exact means of feeding (nipple vs tube) is less important than the timing of colostrum feeding, the volume fed, and the total immunoglobulin mass contained in that volume of colostrum.",

            "text": "4. Passive transfer status can be tested directly by radial immunodiffusion (RID) or indirectly by measurement of serum total protein levels or Brix refractometry per centage. Between 1 and 7 days of age, adequate passive transfer is indicated by a serum IgG concentration >1000 mg/ dl and a serum total protein >5.5 g/dL or a Brix refractometry reading of at least 8.4% and preferably closer to 10%. If the serum sodium sulfite turbidity test is used, use of the 1+ endpoint (turbidity in 18% solution) as an indicator of adequate passive transfer status will maximize the percentage of calves correctly classified by this assay. 5. Regular evaluation of passive transfer status of all newborn calves in a herd allows the veterinarian to objectively monitor colostrum management over time. An on-farm testing method that has been scientifically validated (e.g., serum total protein, immunoassay kit, RID, or sodium sulfite turbidity test) should be used. On a herd basis, producers should aim for greater than 75% (i.e., at least 9 of a sample size of 12) of all calves tested between 2 and 7 days of age to demonstrate a total protein of greater than 5.5 g/dL when maternal colostrum is the means of passive transfer. Periodic quality control checks of conventional or Brix refractometers (against distilled water or sugar solution standards for calibration) is advised. 6. Calves born prematurely or from difficult births may have a variety of physical problems (e.g., swollen tongue) and physiologic disturbances (e.g., hypoxia) that may impact their ability to suckle colostrum or absorb immunoglobulins from the gut. Special attention should be paid to these calves to ensure adequate colostrum ingestion, and subsequent testing of serum is recommended to allow early detection and correction of FPT. For valuable calves believed to be at high risk by virtue of dystocia or phenotype (e.g., large in vitro fertilization calves), IV plasma (where available) or whole-blood transfusion from an appropriately screened donor may be considered in the first day of life. Calves fed colostrum of questionable quality, those not receiving their first colostrum feeding until after 12 hours of life, and calves of exceptional value warrant testing for FPT. Calves found to have FPT should receive a 40-mL/kg dose of commercial plasma or whole bovine blood or plasma from their dam or from a BLV-and BVDV-negative cow. 7. Esophageal feeders and bottles used to feed colostrum must not be used for older or ill calves and must be disinfected and dried between uses. 8. Colostral supplements and replacers are frequently used in place of, or in addition to, colostrum. Some of these products may provide IgG concentrations that are reportedly adequate but do not supply IgA, vitamins, maternal leucocytes, growth factors, and so on, that are normally present in colostrum. Furthermore, these products often do not result in serum protein or immunoglobulin levels equal to that of colostrum-fed calves when used per label. Some of these products, especially those marketed as supplements, contain very low immunoglobulin mass. Although colostrum replacers containing immunoglobulins derived from serum, milk, colostrum, or eggs provide IgG for newborn calves, none appear to be equal or superior to natural colostrum when used as a replacement. Use of such products has recently been implemented in certain herds as a tool to limit transfer of infectious agents to the calf via colostrum, such as MAP, the causative agent of Johne's disease, the bovine leukosis virus, S. Dublin, and Mycoplasma bovis. The most commonly used colostrum replacers in the United States will not reliably achieve the total protein or total solids cutoff point of 5.5 g/dL in the serum in a 2-to 7-day-old calf when used per label, so expectations will need to be lowered if a testing policy is in place. Adequate total protein and IgG concentrations can often be achieved when additional doses or bags of such replacement products are used, but with this comes an increased financial cost. Recent research suggests that when 200 g of IgG (two packets) of a common colostrum replacement product is administered to newborn calves, antibody titers to common viral pathogens reach comparable levels and persist for at least as long as those seen with approximately 4 L of maternally derived colostrum. It is our opinion that the mixing of supplements or replacement products with maternal colostrum as a theoretical means of boosting neonatal IgG levels should be avoided. Although unproven, we believe there might be an increased risk of acute Clostridial spp. diarrhea when these are fed together. In addition to the possibility of decreased efficiency of IgG absorption, maternity (calving) pen management practices that predispose to E. coli septicemia must be corrected. The importance of maternity pen hygiene cannot be overstated because no level of passive immunoglobulin transfer can protect completely against gross filth in the environment, and conversely, even calves with partial or complete FPT may survive when cleanliness is exceptional. Dry cows should not be kept in filthy environments that allow heavy fecal contamination of the coat and udder. Maternity stalls or calving areas should be cleaned, disinfected, and adequately bedded between uses by different cows.",

            "text": "Newborn calves should be removed from the calving area as soon as possible after birth because they will inevitably incur fecal-oral inoculation as they attempt to stand and nurse. Ideally, calves should be moved from the maternity area into individual hutches without being allowed to contact one another. This may not be feasible on larger dairies with limited manpower. In such situations, a small \"safe pen\" for calves can be constructed adjacent to the maternity pens. A safe area is a sheltered, fenced-in, well-drained, bedded concrete-floor pen located in or near the maternity area. These typically measure approximately 20 ft by 20 ft. Walls should be constructed to prevent contact with cows or bedding from the maternity area. This small area can be cleaned and disinfected daily with relative ease, and fresh bedding can be added. A large gate to facilitate cleaning with a bucket loader should be installed at one end of the safe pen to facilitate efficient (and therefore regular) removal of all bedding before cleaning and disinfection, which should be rigorous and regularly scheduled. This pen becomes the holding area for all newborn calves in the maternity area. Personnel on the dairy are made responsible for moving newborn calves into the safe pen as soon as possible after birth; use of gloves and footbaths will aid in the prevention of pathogen spread via boots or clothing. Subsequently, calves are less likely to become rapidly inoculated with pathogens from the maternity area. The calves are kept here until the calf attendant can provide colostrum and move them to hutches. It is critical that the safe pen be disinfected regularly and not be used as a long-term housing area for calves, or accumulation of pathogens is inevitable. On large dairies, particularly those experiencing high calf morbidity and mortality problems in the first 2 weeks of life, it may be cost-effective to dedicate one employee to the maternity pen whose sole responsibility is the prompt removal of newborn calves and near immediate colostrum administration. Only larger dairies will be able to implement this because 24-hour coverage will be necessary to monitor all calvings.",

The fimbrial adhesins that allow pathogenic ETEC to attach to enterocytes are proteins that initially were categorized with the capsular (K) antigens. Currently, classification of fimbrial adhesins as F antigens helps to avoid confusion, but the literature still occasionally refers to K-99, K-88, and so forth rather than the current designation, F-5 and F-4, respectively. In calves, F-5 (K-99) has received the most attention regarding diagnostics and vaccine production for calves. However, ETEC possessing other fimbrial antigens or multiple fimbrial antigen types including F-6, F-17, and F-41 are capable of causing diarrhea in calves. Current literature suggests that F-4 is not associated with diarrhea in calves and that F-17 is found most often in diarrheic calves compared with other fimbrial antigen types, although there is some doubt as to the pathogenic role of F-17, and some sources maintain that it requires other fimbrial antigens to be present to be pathogenic. F-5 and F-41 currently have the strongest association with the presence of diarrhea and are currently considered the most common and significant of the ETEC adhesins. Some ETEC possess several types of fimbriae, and both F-41 and F-5 types may be isolated from an individual diarrheic calf. Colostrum possessing passive antibodies against a specific ETEC fimbrial type will protect newborn calves against that specific F type but will not cross-protect against others. Current and old nomenclature alongside toxin type elaborated for several common ETEC are given in Table 6 .1.",

However, because of lack of cross-protection against various fimbrial antigens, even calves with excellent passive transfer are at risk for ETEC with F types other than those against which the dam has provided colostral antibodies. Colostrum containing antibodies against specific F types will prevent attachment of homologous ETEC to calf enterocytes by coating the fimbriae binding sites. Therefore, colostral protection is a local effect of IgG in the gut. To be effective, colostrum containing antibodies against ETEC F antigens must be fed as early in life as possible, lest ETEC colonize the gut before colostrum has been consumed. Although one experimental design showed colostral F-5 antibodies to be effective up to 3 hours after experimental oral challenge with ETEC F-5, it is more practical to assume colostrum should \"beat\" the ETEC to the gut. Other management factors in addition to colostral feeding are also important in the pathogenesis of ETEC diarrhea. Conditions that allow or encourage buildup of ETEC in the dry cows, in the maternity or neonatal calf facilities, or in stored colostrum increase the risk of ETEC diarrhea, as is true with E. coli septicemia. Marrow products in colostrum may also decrease the risk of ETEC by binding to toxin receptors or preventing proliferation of pathogenic bacteria.",

A 40-kg calf that is judged 10% dehydrated will need 4 L of fluid simply to address current needs. For all calculations of replacement electrolytes, a 50% ECF will be assumed for neonates. Therefore, a 40-kg calf will be assumed to have 40 x 0.5 = 20 L ECF compartment. If this 40-kg calf has a venous plasma bicarbonate concentration of 10 mEq/L, and 25 to 30 mEq/L is the desired normal level, then 15 to 20 mEq of bicarbonate must be replaced in each liter of ECF.

An effective solution, first proposed by Dr. R.H. Whitlock, is formulated by adding 150 mEq of NaHCO 3 to 1 L of 5% glucose. This combination is used for the initial 1 to 3 L of IV therapy, depending on the severity of measured or suspected metabolic acidosis. Glucose corrects hypoglycemia if present, and both bicarbonate and glucose facilitate potassium transport back into cells, thereby lessening the potential cardiotoxicity associated with hyperkalemia. Some reports minimize the importance of hyperkalemia and suggest using IV potassium in the initial fluid. The authors of these papers emphasize that dehydrated calves having severe ETEC-induced secretory diarrhea have a total body K + deficit despite having an elevated ECF potassium concentration. Although this may undoubtedly be true, it seems risky to tempt fate by administering K + -containing solutions as the initial therapy for a patient known to be hyperkalemic. This is especially true for a patient with bradycardia or arrhythmias because death has occasionally occurred when potassium-containing fluids have been given as initial therapy. After plasma K + and HCO 3 levels are quickly improved by the initial 1 to 3 L of 5% dextrose with 150 mEq NaHCO 3 -/L, potassiumcontaining fluids can be safely used. Balanced electrolyte solutions such as lactated Ringer's solution suffice for maintenance fluid needs, but supplemental NaHCO 3 and dextrose may be required to address continued secretory losses and anorexia. Response to treatment usually is dramatic in calves with secretory ETEC diarrhea. Calves that were initially recumbent usually appear much improved after administration of 2 to 4 L of appropriate IV fluids and usually can stand within 6 hours and begin to nurse within 6 to 24 hours of the initiation of therapy. This type of prompt response strongly suggests a correct diagnosis and tends to rule out septicemia because septicemic calves seldom respond so promptly, if at all. Depending on the setting (field vs clinic), maintenance or intermittent IV fluid therapy may be continued or replaced by oral fluids in those calves that quickly regain a suckle response and are eager to eat.",

            "text": "Antibiotic therapy for peracute ETEC infections remains controversial, with current concerns focused on antimicrobial residues in meat and indiscriminate and unnecessary use of antimicrobials leading to resistance. However, in peracute cases, the overlap of many clinical signs with colisepticemia often prompts the clinician to include antimicrobial treatment in the therapeutic regimen. In a Canadian study, diarrheic calves 5 days of age or younger were found to be at significantly greater risk of bacteremia than older calves; this age range obviously includes calves at risk for ETEC infection. Furthermore, in cases with fever and severe debilitation, the veterinarian is often prompted to consider the possibility of complicating conditions such as bacterial pneumonia. In his thorough reviews of the subject, Constable found published evidence supporting the logic and clinical efficacy of antimicrobial use to all calves that exhibit systemic signs of illness or that have blood or mucosal casts in their stool. Extra-label drug use can be justified because the health and potential survival of the patient is threatened, and there is a paucity of approved, labeled claims for the treatment of neonatal diarrhea. In the United States, however, clinicians must always be mindful of federal law that prohibits extra-label third-generation cephalosporin use and limits the use of fluoroquinolones to specific clinical indications. Because of the challenges in differentiating ETEC, E. coli septicemia, and peracute salmonellosis, clinicians are often faced with patients in whom it may be impossible to clinically differentiate true bacteremia from merely lumenally confined enteric bacterial infections when making therapeutic decisions. Parenteral antimicrobials that are bactericidal with a gram-negative spectrum therefore have intuitive appeal for undifferentiated cases. In patients with pure ETEC infections, oral antimicrobial treatment offers the potential benefit of reducing the number of ETEC in the gut, and by reducing the source of enterotoxin, one might also reduce the drive for hypersecretion and ameliorate the metabolic consequences of the enteric infection. Oral amoxicillin trihydrate (10 mg/kg orally every 12 hours) or amoxicillin trihydrate-clavulanate potassium (12.5 mg combined drug/ kg orally every 12 hours) for at least 3 days for treatment of such cases is justifiable if the ETEC strain is believed or proven to be susceptible to the antibiotic. Repeated use of these products over the long term is likely to induce resistance and cause further disruption of the intestinal microbiome; therefore, long-term efforts must focus on prevention rather than treatment. Recommended treatments for diarrheic calves with signs of severe systemic illness (e.g., fever and weakness that persist after fluid resuscitation) include ceftiofur, amoxicillin, potentiated sulfonamides (25 mg/ kg IV or intramuscularly [IM] every 24 hours) or ampicillin (10 mg/kg IM every 12 hours). Systemic antibiotics usually are continued for 3 to 5 days based on the calf 's clinical response, temperature, and character of the feces.",

Even though many oral electrolytes are supplemented with dextrose as an energy source, no commercial oral electrolyte solution provides enough energy for maintenance needs, especially for dairy calves in hutches during winter weather. Weight will be lost, and starvation may occur if these electrolyte solutions are fed as the only ration for more than 1 or 2 days. In highly valuable calves undergoing hospitalization, treatment with parenteral nutrition offers an excellent option to at least approximate maintenance calorific needs while the calf is nil per os (NPO). Calves with ETEC are so significantly catabolic that they will still lose weight despite calorific supplementation with IV lipid and amino acids.

Calves that respond rapidly to initial fluid resuscitation can be started back on small volumes of milk or milk replacer at an earlier time. During recuperation, calves should be deeply bedded in dry straw (Fig. 6 .7) or similar bedding material and provided shelter from rain and snow. When milk feedings are resumed, feedings are best performed in small volumes frequently. If this is not possible, whole milk or replacer should be divided into at least two to three daily feedings. Supplemental oral electrolyte solutions can be continued if ongoing fluid and electrolyte losses are assumed to result from continued diarrhea, and these solutions should be fed at intervals between whole milk or replacer feedings.

It is imperative to use highly alkalinizing electrolyte glucose solutions to provide 4 to 6 L of fluids per day. Parenteral antibiotics are indicated if the affected calf is febrile, and oral antibiotics may be administered when the herd medical history indicates involvement of a highly pathogenic ETEC. Milk or replacer should be reinstituted after 24 to 36 hours, and electrolyte feedings can then be used as fluid supplements in the intervals between milk feedings as needed. Mild ETEC infections seldom require veterinary care. Spontaneous recovery is the rule, and supportive care with oral electrolyte solutions frequently is used by owners in such cases. Use of OTC remedies is widespread among dairy farmers treating mild ETEC infections or nonspecific \"calf scours.\" Although little scientific evidence is found to justify these products, anecdotal testimonials from farmers exist for many oral products and protectants. Oligosaccharides have received increased interest in recent years, the suggested therapeutic rationale being that they provide competitive binding sites within the intestinal lumen for the fimbrial adhesins of ETEC, thereby facilitating intestinal transit and elimination. Although their administration via water has been shown to reduce intestinal coliform counts in experimental ETEC infection, there has yet to be conclusive proof of improved clinical outcomes in challenge studies. OTC calf diarrhea products that contain methscopolamine, atropine, or products that reduce intestinal motility are contraindicated and may cause bloat and ileus if overdosed. Bismuth subsalicylate is palatable and can be used safely in calves.

Evidence of successful passive transfer of immunoglobulins must be evaluated in several consecutive calves to rule out E. coli septicemia or poor colostral feeding as the major cause of ETEC infection. Culturing of colostrum at milking and from the bucket or bottle immediately before its feeding can be used to assess the cleanliness of colostrum milking procedures, colostrum storage, and feeding instrument hygiene. Readers are directed to the previous section on colisepticemia for more details on assessment of colostrum management. Evaluation of whole milk or milk replacer feeding and the detailed specifics by which diarrheic calves are being treated become extremely important. Mixing errors leading to hyperosmolality of oral feedings (especially electrolyte solutions) or milk replacer can add a further and compromising degree of nutritional diarrhea in some situations. It is remarkable how many extra supplements can be added to the feeding regimen on problem farms such that the end product becomes a contributor to the persistence and severity of the diarrhea. The osmolality of electrolyte solutions should be in the range of 300 to 600 mOs/L, although some solutions at the high end of this range may be problematic if ad libitum water is not available. The ad libitum provision of palatable fresh water is imperative, hyperosmolality of administered oral fluids being compounded by the lack of water by which the calf can compensate. The two biggest challenges to adequate water intake are the health or severity of illness in the calf and the freezing conditions during northern U.S. winter months. Water intake is maximal immediately after milk feeding, so at the very least fresh, warm unfrozen water should be made available shortly after milk or milk replacer intake. Measuring total solids in milk replacer, as fed, is a highly relevant part of a herd investigation as is checking osmolality of any oral rehydration solutions, again as fed. Total solids of milk replacer solutions should never exceed 18%, and it is always reassuring to be able to demonstrate consistency by virtue of a less than 1% variation from feeding to feeding. Milk replacer hygiene is just as relevant as total solids or osmolality; substantial bacterial contamination of milk, colostrum, or milk replacer because of unsanitary equipment, powder storage, or the use of unpasteurized waste milk has detrimental health consequences for all calves but especially those for whom adequacy of passive transfer was compromised. Targets established by Dr. Sheila McGuirk are a total bacterial count of less than 20,000 CFU/mL, a total coliform count of less than 1000 CFU/mL and a total E. coli count of less than 100 CFU/mL for pasteurized waste milk; for milk replacer, the set points are less than 10,000 CFU/mL, less than 1000 CFU/mL, and zero, respectively. Samples for testing should be sampled as fed; for example, they should be taken via the nipple in a group pen situation rather than at the time of mixing.",

When specific F antigen ETEC are involved, a commercial bacterin containing these F types can be administered to the dry cows 6 weeks and 3 weeks before freshening or at manufacturer's recommended times. Autogenous bacterin manufacturers should be required to show data on endotoxin levels in bacterins because administration of endotoxin-rich vaccines to adult cattle can cause dramatic production losses or abortion.

As a rule, rotaviruses coexist with other neonatal enteric pathogens such as ETEC and C. parvum in herd calfhood diarrhea outbreaks.

Germ-free calves infected by rotavirus have self-limiting diarrhea and rapid recovery. Infected calves in field situations may have inapparent, mild, moderate, or fatal disease.

Therefore, rotavirus diarrhea is characterized by maldigestion and malabsorption. To further complicate matters, the intestinal crypt cells continue their normal secretory function, which is no longer balanced by absorptive villous function. Thus, net secretion outweighs absorption and contributes further to diarrhea. Increasing intraluminal osmotic pressure also may draw further water into the bowel as lactose and other undigested nutrients pass through the gut and are fermented in the colon to volatile fatty acids. Bacterial fermentation of undigested lactose creates both D-and L-isomers of lactic acid; in diarrheic calves, absorption of the slowly metabolized D-isomer may result in accumulation of this acid in the systemic circulation, thereby contributing to the development of metabolic acidosis and clinical depression.

            "text": "Several differences are noted, however: 1. Because of villous enterocyte pathology, the efficiency of absorption of oral electrolyte and energy sources is likely reduced compared to ETEC infections. Obviously, this comment is relative, not absolute because generally less than 100% of the small intestinal villi are damaged. Therefore, absorption of some proportion of the glucose, electrolytes, and water that comprise the oral fluids will occur, and aggressive oral fluid therapy (4-6 L/day) is still indicated in this disease. Isotonic electrolyte replacements may be preferable unless the calf is hypoglycemic. Electrolyte solutions containing glutamate mixed with yogurt may speed intestinal recovery, although this is not proven in calves. 2. Maldigestion and malabsorption influence the duration of diarrhea and the digestibility of whole milk or milk replacers in patients with viral enteritis. When diarrhea from rotavirus becomes evident, the damage to the intestinal lining has already occurred, and only time and supportive care can allow the intestine to heal. Nutritional support is a critical component of that supportive care, particularly because rotaviral scours may persist for 3 to 7 days. Producers should be counseled that provision of milk or milk replacer is necessary in viral enteritis even though the maldigestion of the milk nutrients may contribute in part to the pathologic process. Denial (for >24 hours) of milk feeding to a calf with viral diarrhea places the calf at significant risk for cachexia and may lower its resistance to opportunistic disease. Death from starvation may occur in such cases, particularly during times of inclement weather (Fig. 6.8) . To quote Dr. Chuck Guard, \"If a calf scours for a week, and all that the calf is fed is oral electrolyte replacer, then that calf will be well hydrated and will have absolutely perfect blood electrolyte concentrations and acid-base balance on the day it starves to death.\" Producers should learn to live with the \"more-in, more out\" rule: The more milk that goes in the front end, the more diarrhea comes out the back end. However, this process is not necessarily harmful because digestion and absorption of some fraction of milk nutrients is likely to occur, and these nutrients are necessary to support the tissue synthesis required to return the intestine to normal. Any exacerbation of fluid losses and acidosis that may result from maldigestion of milk nutrients can be offset by aggressive fluid and electrolyte replacement. Ideally, the affected calf should be fed small amounts frequently with the addition of lactase-containing tablets. Because maldigestion is part of the pathophysiology, common sense suggests that dividing milk feeding into smaller but more frequent meals would allow improved digestion and lower the amount of carbohydrate reaching the colon. Excessive amounts of carbohydrates reaching the colon may worsen diarrhea, systemic metabolic status especially D-lactic acidosis, and the clinical status of the calf. 3. Maturation of immature villous replacement cells of crypt origin will allow the intestinal tract to return to normal within several days to 1 week in most patients that recover. Intravenous fluid therapy is necessary for recumbent, extremely dehydrated, or \"shocky\" patients and patients that have lost their suckle reflex. It is best guided by acidbase and electrolyte determinations. If this is not practical or available, however, the most severely affected calves with acute diarrhea should be assumed to have metabolic acidosis, low bicarbonate, high potassium, and low glucose values. Guidelines for fluid therapy are available in the section on treatment of ETEC. Parenteral nutrition may be \"lifesaving\" in calves with cachexia.",

Continued feeding of colostrum is ideal but often not practical. Initial postnatal ingestion of very high antibody-containing colostrum may in fact create high enough humoral antibody levels to establish high levels of secretory IgG 1 antibodies in the gut. Boosting the level of colostral antibodies against rotavirus usually is done by vaccinating the dry cow with MLV or killed vaccines containing rotavirus and coronavirus, sometimes in combination with ETEC antigens.

No vaccine or antibody can overcome massive viral challenge, and conversely, less concern for passive protection is necessary when management excels at reducing risk for the newborn calf.

Affected calves tend to be slightly older than calves infected with pure ETEC or pure rotavirus. They average 7 to 10 days of age at onset, with some observed as late as 3 weeks of age. The virus causes a severe enterocolitis characterized by villous enterocyte destruction in the small intestine and destruction of both ridges and crypts in the large intestine.

Because it is assumed that local antibody is more important than humoral antibody, the feeding of colostrum containing high antibody levels against coronavirus is advantageous, and when possible, prolonged feeding of such colostrum during the first 30 days of life might confer greater protection for problem farms. Active immunization of calves at birth with multivalent products containing coronavirus (usually in combination with E. coli and rotavirus) is also quite commonly practiced but should be considered a less reliable and effective method of protecting calves compared with the absorption of high IgG 1 concentration colostrum from immunized dams. Specific antibody products are available and can be administered to newborn calves at birth. One such product contains K-99 antibodies and coronavirus antibodies (First Defense, ImmuCell Corp., Portland, ME) derived from hyperimmune bovine colostrum.

A parasitophorous vacuole that resides adherent to the cell but outside the cytoplasm is formed. The life cycle phases of C. parvum then result in destruction of cells as the parasitophorous vacuoles break to release merozoites that infect other host cells. The subsequent sexual life cycle phase results in formation of oocysts infective to susceptible hosts. Villous atrophy, villous fusion, and inflammation of intestinal crypts ensue. Autoinfection within the intestine occurs, wherein specialized oocysts are released to infect other enterocytes without exiting the host. Clinical signs of diarrhea reflect a mixed pathophysiology of maldigestion, malabsorption, and osmotic effects with or without secretory and inflammatory factors. The autoinfection process has been hypothesized to account for occasional protracted or relapsing cases that can result in cachexia. The prepatent period for C. parvum is 3 to 4 days, although the majority of clinical cases are not detected until at least 7 days of age unless there is massive, immediate postpartum exposure. Damage to the microvilli appears to predispose the calf to combined infections with E. coli, viruses, or Salmonella spp. Therefore, it is unusual in dairy calves to find only C. parvum when investigating endemic calf diarrhea. However, because oocyst shedding typically begins with the onset of clinical signs and persists until several days after diarrhea resolves, fecal testing may tend to reveal this pathogen more consistently than rotavirus or coronavirus, which are shed early in the disease course and for a shorter period of time than C. parvum. This reiterates the importance of testing affected calves early in the disease course when investigating the etiology of calf diarrhea. Combinations of enteric pathogens in neonatal calves complicate treatment, worsen the clinical signs and prognosis, tend to result in higher mortality, and predispose to malnutrition.

Bedding from within and around hutches should be completely removed and disposed of, the ground stripped bare, and the bare ground allowed several days to weeks of sunlight exposure under dry conditions before being considered habitable for another calf.

Moving cleaned hutches to new ground or placing them on concrete slabs that can be cleaned, disinfected, and allowed to dry between calves is the best technique. Because Cryptosporidium oocysts are highly resistant to the effects of almost all disinfectants, hutches and feeding equipment must be vigorously and thoroughly scrubbed with soap and water and rinsed well with hot water to physically dislodge oocysts. Drying and ultraviolet light are relatively effective against the oocysts; therefore, more hutches should be made available than would be occupied at any given time; a 20% vacancy rate for newly scrubbed hutches will often allow ample time for sun exposure and drying of recently emptied hutches. The role that moisture can play in encouraging oocyst persistence has been further demonstrated by epidemiologic studies that find that a slope of 5% to 10% in the calf housing area will diminish risks of infection, but rainfall will increase shedding rates.

Despite the diversity of serovars, relatively few are responsible for a large proportion of clinical infections among cattle and other mammals. Many of these serovars are capable of causing clinical disease in a broad range of host species (e.g., Enteritidis, Typhimurium, and Newport).

Although antibiotic therapy may aid clinical recovery, it does not stop fecal shedding or positively affect the duration of fecal shedding. 3. Salmonellae are facultative intracellular organisms, and antimicrobial penetration into the infected host cell is often limited even for antimicrobials that show in vitro efficacy against the organism. Reasons to use antibiotics include: 1. Bacteremia is common with salmonellosis of any type in neonates and is very common with S. Dublin. 2. Veterinarians cannot always predict which calves are septicemic and which are only endotoxemic when faced with signs of shock and severe diarrhea. 3. Although intracellular penetration of infected host cells by antibiotics may be limited, adequate blood concentrations of an effective antibiotic may limit spread of infection from the gut to other tissues by acting on the organisms that are free in the blood and ECF. 4. Clinical impressions suggest a shorter course of disease and higher recovery rate when antibiotics are used. 5. Secondary infections (e.g., septic meningitis, arthritis) are possible in severely ill calves with salmonellosis. Antibiotic therapy is justified for calves with peracute or acute signs that suggest overwhelming infection. Calves having mild signs, that are asymptomatic, and with chronic disease do not appear to benefit from antibiotic therapy. Given the characteristically unpredictable nature of antibiotic susceptibility exhibited by Salmonella spp., selection should be based on culture and sensitivity. Currently, some strains are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, macrolides, and tetracyclines but are frequently sensitive to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and trimethoprim-sulfas. Antibiotic therapy should be maintained at least 5 to 7 days for peracute and acute salmonellosis and is more likely to be necessary in type B, C, and D infections than with type E. A decision not to use antibiotics for calves with salmonellosis is easier to enforce when the mortality rate is low or nonexistent. This same decision is impossible to enforce when a high mortality rate occurs because owners will not tolerate such losses and will demand antibiotics or change veterinarians in the hope of saving sick calves. Ultimately, decisions on antibiotic use must be based on humane considerations weighed against the public health concerns related to induction of resistance in an organism with demonstrated zoonotic potential. Wholesale treatment of calves at risk and the use of oral antibiotics such as tetracycline for all calves in a group are contraindicated because these techniques are more likely to be ineffective or lead to antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics should be considered as potential components of the treatment regimen, with aggressive fluid and electrolyte replacement, good nursing care, and maintenance of adequate nutrition as primary considerations. Experience suggests that resolution of a salmonellosis problem on a dairy requires far more critical and influential decisions than antibiotic selection for individual cases.",

In other parts of the world, this assay is being used for surveillance and control of S. Dublin on a national level through screening of herds every 3 months. It seems unlikely at this point in time that a national program of this nature will come into effect in the United States, but it is worth remembering that S. Dublin tends to be more pathogenic in human patients than many other serovars and that its prevalence is undoubtedly on the increase in this country. One has to be careful when interpreting a positive ELISA result in young calves because of the possibility of passively derived antibody rather than naturally acquired titers. It is probable that passively derived antibody for S. Dublin wanes along the same time frame as other colostrally derived antibodies, hence calves might be expected to be negative by early postweaning and certainly before breeding age unless true postnatal exposure has occurred. Detection of carrier animals by culture is very difficult because of inapparent infections, variable patterns of shedding, and the failure of negative cultures to completely rule out a carrier state. In the case of non-Dublin serovars recovered animals continue to shed type B, C, and E organisms for 3 to 6 months or more in some instances. Therefore, control measures based on detection and elimination of infected animals or carriers are more easily instituted when small groups are infected; they can be impractical and unlikely to succeed in very large freestall herds where animal movement, comingling of heifers from multiple source farms, and new purchases are the norm.",

Because cell-mediated immunity is a major factor in host resistance, killed bacterins that stimulate only humoral immunity give questionable protection. Vaccination of dry cows with specific Salmonella bacterins may protect neonatal calves somewhat for the first 2 to 3 weeks of life but probably not thereafter. Autogenous bacterins developed from the specific Salmonella serotype involved in an epidemic may be more helpful in this regard. Advances in onfarm efficacy in vaccines for the protection of cattle against Salmonella spp. has been challenged by the numerous serotypes encountered on many farms over time and the fact that cross protection between serotypes is notoriously poor, especially with killed products. Killed vaccines administered to neonatal calves have not performed well in research trials, primarily because calves appear to respond poorly to the oligosaccharide side chain antigens that comprise the protective antigens. Both commercial and autogenous bacterins must be used with caution because anaphylactic or endotoxic reactions are possible and are thought to represent an inherited hypersensitivity to endotoxin or other mediators. Aromatic-dependent S. Typhimurium and S. Dublin strains have been used as MLVs in calves and appear promising because they stimulate both cellular and humoral immune responses. One such product is available commercially in the United States for protection against S. Dublin (Entervene-D, Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, St. Joseph, MO); it is labeled for use in calves older than 2 weeks of age and has enjoyed quite widespread use as a component of S. Dublin control efforts on many farms. A word of caution, however, is indicated with the product because it can be associated with life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions, and producers and veterinarians need to discuss this risk and be prepared for this eventuality when administering it to calves preweaning. The use of this vaccine will, of course, interfere with serologic testing efforts to identify individuals previously naturally infected with the organism.

Recent research has demonstrated that this product can elicit specific IgG antibody against S. Newport in colostrum when administered at dry off and 4 weeks later and that this can be transferred passively to new born calves after ingestion of colostrum. Unfortunately, at this point in time, what is unknown is whether this passive antibody will confer a protective effect for calves against natural challenge to either the vaccinal serotype or other strains in a farm environment. This subunit vaccine utilizes siderophore receptors and porins as antigens from S. Newport to stimulate an immune response against iron acquiring mechanisms employed by the bacterium (as well as other serotypes of Salmonella and other gram-negative species) during rapid bacterial growth. By \"starving\" the bacteria of iron, there will hopefully be attenuation and reduction in the severity of any subsequent infection; possibly conferring cross protection against multiple serotypes, even with other gram-negative species. There are philosophical similarities with the use of gram-negative core mutant products such as J5 and Endovac-Bovi as a component of Salmonella control in calves in that these products raise antibody against conserved epitopes of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall to hopefully ameliorate the pathogenic effects of endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but similarly do not entirely prevent infection. The use of these gram-negative core mutant products as a means of inspiring passive protection through dry cow immunization and colostral transfer, or by active immunization of preweaned calves also continues to enjoy some acceptance within the dairy industry, but there is relatively little scientific evidence to support either approach. For example, although immunization of calves with commercial J-5 vaccines has been shown to reduce mortality from salmonellosis in an experimental challenge study, in a large field trial, J-5 immunization of calves did not affect survival to 100 days.",

Salmonella control is often a numbers game, and reduction in pathogen load requires evaluation of all facets of calf handling and colostrum and milk feeding. Carefully scrutinize each and every step of the process of calf handling from parturition (maternity area hygiene) through placement in the hutch or pen. Often the first material ingested by the newborn calf is directly from the maternity environment, immediately after birth, and before consuming colostrum. In an outbreak on a Colorado dairy, a colleague of the authors, Dr. Rob Callan, isolated Salmonella Infantis from the nose and mouth of a newborn calf less than 5 minutes after being born. This calf had been pulled several yards across the ground of the maternity pen to a separate area where calves were then fed colostrum. In this situation, Salmonella was likely ingested well before consuming colostrum, greatly increasing the risk of infection. Although maternity pen hygiene is essential for minimizing exposure in calves, prompt removal of calves to individual calf hutches can also be pivotal in control. Washable industrial wheelbarrows and wheeled bins make for excellent transfer vehicles for moving calves from the maternity area to designated calf housing. Alternatively, a calf \"safe pen\" can be considered (see previous section on colisepticemia). C. All feeding and cleaning implements for sick calves should be scrubbed with soap and hot water and then disinfected between uses and never used on healthy calves. D.

If labor is spread thin, it may be easiest for the producer to hire additional labor or reallocate personnel such that certain people are solely dedicated to the husbandry of calves.

The exact reason for clinical disease is often difficult to determine in sporadic cases but usually can be linked to \"pushing\" calves nutritionally when endemic problems are observed in a herd. Feeding of large volumes of milk or milk replacer, especially in the form of large meals, appears to be a common triggering factor.

Recent pathologic description of confirmed cases has detailed that hemorrhagic, coagulative intestinal necrosis is common, especially affecting the jejunum and ileum and that hemorrhagic stool is more common than nonhemorrhagic stool but not invariant. Pathologic lesions can also be found outside the small intestine, with the abomasum, spiral colon, and cecum often demonstrating extensive hemorrhagic necrosis.

Commensal C. perfringens type A may proliferate in the gut and invade tissues within a short period after death, especially in warm weather. In fact, postmortem enteric proliferation of C. perfringens type A may be so extensive that it masks the presence of type C when luminal contents are cultured.

Orogastric tube passage and decompression may be helpful in some cases; elevation of the calf 's forequarters while the tube is placed may be helpful in releasing gas; however, because the predominant site of tympany is the abomasum, not the rumen, the therapeutic benefit of orogastric intubation is often minimal. Oral antibiotics such as penicillin or tetracycline may be helpful in reducing the rate of intraluminal gas production. Decompression of the abomasum via percutaneous ventral abomasocentesis has been described, and intraluminal injection of antibiotics could be performed after decompression. The blind trocharization of the left paralumbar fossa of tympanitic calves in the field is to be avoided. It is understandably tempting to attempt to decompress what can be a massively distended abdomen in this more typical anatomic location on the mistaken belief that it is the rumen that is causing the distension, but we have seen several lacerated abomasums when a 14-gauge needle is placed dorsally in this way-as the thin, distended abomasum deflates, the needle continues to cut into the organ like cheesewire. In cases that become progressively distended or in valuable calves, a laparotomy to drain the abomasal contents and oversew severe abomasal ulcers is often lifesaving.

Furthermore, increased attention to antimicrobial resistance patterns among food animal-derived isolates of Campylobacter spp. heightens awareness of antimicrobial use in the dairy and beef industry and the potential role that both therapeutic and nontherapeutic drug use may play in increasing the public health threat of these foodborne pathogens. C. jejuni and C. coli can commonly be found in the feces of healthy calves (especially C. jejuni), and several studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of culture-positive fecal samples in dairy calves preweaning is in the range of about 15% of all calves on farm and that this rate is similar when diarrheic calves and normal calves are sampled.

The whey, which contains lactose, protein, immunoglobulins, and minerals, passes into the duodenum for digestion, but the casein or fat coagulum is digested slowly. For many years, it was thought that milk replacers had to \"clot\" in the abomasum or else they were inferior and caused diarrhea and poor growth.

Optimally, the increased volume is delivered by providing at least one additional daily feeding to calves. Alternatively, a concentrated energy source is added to the regular liquid diet or a higher concentration of dried milk replacer powder is fed at the same number of daily feedings.

Table 6 .4 shows that neither a 20:20 nor a 22:20 milk replacer is predicted to meet that expectation. At cold temperatures (20\u00b0 and 40\u00b0F), a 6-quart per day diet is both protein and energy deficient, but at the warmer temperatures of 60\u00b0 and 80\u00b0F, the 6 quart per day diet is only protein deficient. With the higher protein milk replacers (24:18 and 28:20), the 6-quart diet is limited by energy intake at colder temperatures. At 20\u00b0F, both the 24:18 and 28:20 milk replacers are too low in energy, but at 40\u00b0F, only the 24:18 milk replacer is limiting ADG because of lack of energy. If the same 2-week-old, 95-lb Holstein calf is fed 8 quarts of milk replacer per day (40 oz of milk replacer powder), all of the milk replacers shown in Table 6 .4 would meet energy and protein requirements to achieve at least an ADG of 1.6 lb/day. Although the tables are focused on NRC predictions for feeding milk or milk replacer at different temperatures, they are useful to guide clinicians in feeding sick, stressed, or immune-challenged calves. It is still recommended to feed sick calves for expected ADG. One can provide more frequent feedings of the typical milk or milk replacer diet to which the calf is accustomed to achieve adequate intake. Milk, milk replacer, and water should be delivered at the temperature to which the calf has been accustomed but it is important to offer it at a temperature of at least 93\u00b0F.

Traditionally, it has been considered a problem in group-housed weaned calves, but the prepatent period is such that clinical disease can be seen before weaning in modern group-reared nursing calf management systems. This style of management currently is very popular because it decreases the labor requirements for many large dairies and is convenient in colder climates. Although up to 20 species of Eimeria may infect cattle, E. bovis and E. zuernii are considered the major pathogenic species. Sporulated oocysts that are infective for calves and older cattle arise from oocysts passed in the feces of cattle with patent infections. Whereas moisture and cool conditions are conducive to sporulation, extreme heat and dryness are detrimental. Oocysts can remain viable for more than 1 year in favorable conditions that include moisture and absence of temperature extremes. Fecal contamination of feedstuffs, water, or hair coats allows ingestion of infective oocysts by other cattle. Conditions favoring fecal contamination of feed and water exist when calves are grouped in mini free stalls, bedded packs, or other group housing systems such as is becoming increasingly popular with automated milk feeding of calves. Calves may ingest feces containing oocysts from feed bunks that become contaminated when calves come running up to the bunk to be fed and then splash manure into the bunk or waterers, from calves licking themselves and ingesting feces or fecal-stained hair, or from browsing on contaminated bedding in a housing unit.",

Ingested sporulated oocysts excyst in the host, release sporozoites that invade host cells (central lacteals of ileal villi for E. bovis, connective tissue cells of ileal lamina propria for E. zuernii), and grow to schizonts (meronts) that release merozoites that then infect epithelial cells in the cecum and colon. Second-generation schizonts then form in these cells and subsequently release merozoites that begin the sexual phase of the reproductive cycle by invading yet another host epithelial cell and become microgamonts (male) or macrogamonts (female). Microgamonts release microgametes that seek host cells containing macrogametes (matured macrogamont), fertilization takes place, and a zygote forms and matures to an oocyst that then is released by rupture of the host cell. Invasion of cells and subsequent release of merozoites and oocysts incite varying degrees of pathology within the epithelium of the cecum and colon of affected calves. The magnitude of enteric pathology appears to be related to the dose of oocysts ingested. Small doses of ingested oocysts may result in inapparent infection and eventual induction of immunity.

If calves are kept in a clean environment, manure should be scraped away daily to prevent \"splashing\" of feces into bunks, troughs, waterers, and all over calves' bodies. If premises are cleaned and disinfected between consecutive groups of calves, the risk of coccidiosis is lowered tremendously. Unfortunately, many farmers would rather rely on a drug placed in the feed than do the required cleaning. Many of the coccidiostats are only effective for as long as fed, so calves become at risk if medicated feed is discontinued or there is an interruption in medicated feed or water consumption for some other reason. Therefore, anticoccidial drugs usually are included in the ration for extended periods such as from weaning through breeding age rather than based on manufacturer's recommendations (e.g., 30 days). Increasingly, calf starters and milk replacers including coccidiostats are being marketed for dairy calves. Although these drugs may not be necessary in preweaned calves, it is possible that clinical coccidiosis could occur as early as 2 to 3 weeks of age. Although the rumen is poorly developed in neonatal calves, lasalocid fed from day 1 improves gain and counterbalances coccidial infection (experimentally induced) before weaning. Careful attention to accurate dosing of ionophores in preweaned calves is especially important because this age of animal seems rather prone to toxicity, typically manifested as neurologic signs reminiscent of meningitis or salt poisoning. Certainly, if management conditions allow preweaning coccidiosis, mixed infections of the GI tract would be possible in 2-to 4-week-old calves.

O. ostertagi (brown stomach worm) is the most important nematode in cattle because of its ability to undergo hypobiosis or arrested development of the L4 stage within the abomasum of infected young cattle. Arrested larvae reside in the lumen of gastric glands during seasons of the year that would likely interfere with the parasites' existence outside the host. Therefore, larvae acquired during late fall and early winter at temperatures found in northern climates persist in the host as inhibited larvae for weeks to months before maturing in late winter and spring. In southern temperate zones, larvae acquired during the spring become inhibited and finally mature in late summer or early fall. The biologic purpose of O. ostertagi hypobiosis is to avoid exposure of eggs and larval stages to weather not conducive to survival of the parasite. Therefore, harsh winters are avoided in the north, as are hot dry summers in southern zones. In the abomasal wall, hypobiotic larvae are apparently not targeted by the immune system for elimination, even in previously exposed adult cattle. When arrested larvae emerge from the abomasal glands, they tend to do so with a vengeance that creates severe abomasal pathology and illness known as ostertagiasis type II. Maturation and emergence of large numbers of inhibited L4 larvae cause acute anorexia, weight loss, hypoproteinemia, and severe diarrhea as a result of abomasal mucosal injury, increased abomasal pH because of parietal cell dysfunction, and hyperplasia. The mortality rate is high with this form, although prevalence usually is low. The resultant greatly thickened and nodular abomasal wall has caused pathologists to describe the gross lesion as \"Moroccan leather\" in appearance. Because ostertagiasis type II occurs in the late winter and spring in northern zones and late summer or fall in southern areas, parasites may not be considered as the cause of illness in affected heifers. Inhibited larvae also are resistant to many commonly used anthelmintics. Ostertagiasis type I is more classically typical of nematode infections because pastured heifers acquire significant loads of larvae that mature to adults over approximately 3 weeks. Type I infections occur during peak pasture seasons and can result in diarrhea, weight loss, hypoproteinemia, or simply poor weight gain.",

Fasciola hepatica is found most commonly in certain areas along the Gulf Coast and western United States; it is rare in the northern United States. Cattle, along with sheep, are the primary definitive hosts of F. hepatica and shed eggs in feces. Eggs require a moist environment to hatch miracidia, which find a snail intermediate host. After a complicated reproductive cycle in the snail, the parasite eventually produces metacercariae, which are ingested by grazing animals. Metacercariae invade the duodenum, and immature flukes then penetrate the gut and seek out the liver, where they penetrate the capsule, migrate in the parenchyma, and eventually reside in the bile ducts. This wandering through the gut and liver parenchyma creates a great deal of pathology, which in heavy infestations may cause hypoproteinemia, anemia, reduced appetite, peritonitis, and importantly, predispose to clostridial diseases such as bacillary hemoglobinuria (C. hemolyticum), or black disease (C. novyi). Fascioloides magna, the deer liver fluke, is a large fluke that can infect cattle and sheep. The fluke is found along the Gulf Coast, the Great Lakes region, and the northwestern United States. Although cattle can be infected, the resulting parenchymal cyst does not allow egg release, thus making cattle dead-end hosts. In deer, the natural host, thin-walled parenchymal cysts are formed that allow eggs to emerge into bile ducts. F. magna is particularly vicious in sheep because continued migration without encystment is the rule. Because infections are not patent in cattle, liver condemnation or gross postmortem lesions are the major consequences of F. magna infection.",

The application of modern molecular diagnostic techniques for more sensitive and specific differentiation of these different species of Parapox viruses has been prompted by not just altruistic scientific advance but also by the desire to rapidly identify the precise viral agent causing suspicious vesicular lesions of ruminants and to trace the cause of skin lesions in humans because all of these agents are zoonotic. Such differentiation is now possible using quantitative PCR (qPCR) techniques. In cattle, the disease is spread by contact between infected and noninfected calves or via common feeding devices or containers. The virus is quite contagious in young calves, and it is worth remembering that it also can cause lesions on the skin of humans working with calves. Such zoonotic infection creates lesions similar to the milker's nodules of pseudocowpox in people. Papular stomatitis virus lesions on the muzzle and in the oral cavity of calves frequently are confused with erosions caused by BVDV or potentially other vesicular diseases such as foot and mouth, vesicular stomatitis, or epizootic hemorrhagic disease.

Many other species of Actinomyces have been studied in humans, and comparative information from these studies suggests that A. bovis is much more resistant to antibiotic therapy than human isolates such as Actinomyces israeli. Lumpy jaw is a debilitating disease of cattle resulting from infection of the mandible or maxilla by A. bovis. The organism has been described as a normal inhabitant of the oral flora and digestive tract of cattle. It is assumed that infection of bones and teeth occurs after injury to the oral mucosa by fibrous feeds or dental eruption (this may be a reason that lumpy jaw seems most common in young adult cattle) and subsequent inoculation of A. bovis. The organism also may penetrate around the alveoli of the teeth or contaminate skin wounds via common feed and water troughs. Dr. Rebhun observed one herd with an epidemic of lumpy jaw, with 7 of 60 cows affected. The point source cow had a large, draining, lumpy jaw lesion, and all cows ate silage twice daily from a feed bunk made of coarse boards. Discharge of the organism from the point source cow certainly contaminated the sideboards and bunk. Whether the organism had gained access through the oral cavity, injury to the oral cavity by wood splinters, or skin puncture from wood slivers on the sideboards could not be ascertained. Lumpy jaw usually is a sporadic infection, but as in the aforementioned herd, can be an epidemic or endemic herd problem.",

VSV is considered endemic in parts of South America, Central America, and the southwestern United States. In recent years, many livestock operations in the intermountain West have been quarantined after detection of VSV infection in cattle and horses. VSV usually occurs during the summer and fall, but one large epidemic developed during the late fall and early winter in California during 1982 and 1983. In more recent outbreaks, the disease has sporadically occurred in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona in spring and early summer and then proceeded to spread northward into Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Idaho, Utah, and as far north and west as Nebraska. The general trend for cases to occur in the summer and fall is suggestive of an arthropod vector. Attention has focused on a species of midge, Culicoides sonorensis, as a likely vector for VSV because viral replication in multiple tissues of this insect has been documented following experimental VSV infection.

Because different strains of BTV may behave differently in cattle, monoclonal FA, virus neutralization, or molecular assays may help further characterize serotypes of virus isolated from blood or tissues. The blood of infected cattle remains positive for viral nucleic acids by RT-PCR for a much longer duration (nearly 4 months) than for virus isolation.",

Because BPV types can be found in normal skin as well as cutaneous papillomas and fibropapillomas, it is uncertain which BPV types actually cause the lesions. Recent studies have identified the DNA of several different BPV types in many cutaneous papilloma and fibropapilloma lesions. Experimentally, cutaneous papillomas can be induced by the inoculation of BPV-1 or BPV-2, but the upper alimentary tract lesions are often histologically classified as squamous papillomas and are thought to be associated with BPV-4 infection. The prevalence of upper GI papillomas can be increased by exposure to bracken fern, which is believed to be immunosuppressive. Bracken fern exposure is not, however, necessary for the development of upper GI squamous papillomas because they occur in the absence of this plant. Squamous fibropapillomas of the upper GI tract are thought due to BPV-2 infection. BPV-2 has also been demonstrated in association with urinary bladder carcinomas in cows with chronic enzootic hematuria.

A single cow within a herd might develop the disease secondary to septic metritis, septic mastitis, BVDV, or other periparturient disorders. Infection seldom spread to other cows. However, in recent decades, larger herds and increased use of free stall housing have changed the clinical epidemiology of salmonellosis, such that herd outbreaks with subsequent endemicity and variable morbidity and mortality are now the rule. Free-stall housing creates a nightmarish setting for diseases such as salmonellosis that are spread by fecal-oral transmission. Stressors include such things as concurrent infection with other bacterial or viral pathogens, transportation, parturition, poor transition cow management, GI stasis or disturbance of the GI flora by recent feed changes, heat or cold, and recent anesthesia or surgery.",

Dublin infection is that infected cows may remain carriers for a long time or even forever.

Clinical mastitis caused by S. Dublin is thought to originate from environmental contamination of the udder by feces from infected cattle rather than septicemic spread to the udder. Infected calves shed large numbers of organisms, frequently are septicemic, and have respiratory signs coupled with fever that confound the diagnosis and mislead veterinarians unfamiliar with this disease. Other than S. Dublin-infected cattle, most cattle infected with non-host adapted serotypes such as S. Typhimurium are thought to shed the organism for less than 6 months.

As with most facultative intracellular bacteria, the host's cell-mediated immune system is essential for effective defense. Diarrhea caused by Salmonella spp. is primarily of inflammatory origin with lesser contributions (in some serotypes) by secretory mechanisms.

The presence of Salmonella spp. on a dairy farm is therefore not an unexpected finding, and transmission to cattle is primarily via ingestion. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) Dairy 2007 study, based on a single sampling visit to dairy operations in 17 major dairy states, showed that 40% of herds included had at least one cow that was Salmonella positive by fecal culture.",

In the same study of more than 800 herds, the animal-level incidence rate for salmonellosis among preweaned female calves was estimated to be 8.1 cases per 1000 animal-years compared with 1.8 cases per 1000 animal-years among adult cows.

The Kaplan-Meier median duration of fecal Salmonella shedding among dairy cattle after clinical disease was found to be 50 days, which is well beyond the typical period of clinical signs in cattle with salmonellosis. However, the duration of fecal Salmonella shedding exceeded 1 year in some animals. Adult cattle with salmonellosis tend to shed Salmonella organisms in their feces longer than calves do, in part because calves often die early in the course of disease. Infected cattle shed copious numbers of Salmonella organisms in their feces; the concentration of Salmonella within the manure of an infected cow ranges from 10 2 to 10 7 organisms per gram of fresh feces. As adult dairy cattle generate approximately 70 kg of manure per day, this translates into a daily environmental contamination of between 7 \u00d7 10 6 and 7 \u00d7 10 11 Salmonella organisms per cow. This undoubtedly leads to widespread and rapid contamination of the dairy farm environment, and Salmonella organisms can survive for prolonged periods in suitable conditions outside the host. Thus, fecal Salmonella shedding increases the risk of within-herd transmission and inadvertent spread to other herds. Importantly, in addition to impacting the health and productivity of dairy cattle, these factors lead to an increased risk of zoonotic transmission.",

Observations from previous studies also demonstrate variations in the regional prevalence of Salmonella burden among dairy cattle in the United States, specifically that there is an increase along a southerly gradient. For example, 33% of more than 700 cows culled from Texas dairy farms were Salmonella-positive based on fecal culture results, but only 13% of sampled dairy cows scheduled for culling across the entire the United States were found to be culture-positive for Salmonella spp. The underlying mechanisms for this and the seasonal trend are likely similar.",

Similarly, herds with more than 500 cows have higher odds of having at least one Salmonella-positive cow, relative to smaller herds. Larger herds may have a greater likelihood of purchasing cattle from various outside sources, with the accompanying risk of introducing Salmonella via a subclinical shedder that has been stressed by transport. High cattle density may also be a feature of larger herds and could promote Salmonella transmission; animal crowding not only enhances contact among cattle but may also emphasize the immunologic and clinical impact of stressful group dynamics. Additionally, larger herds are likely to be characterized by management practices that play a role in increasing the probability of feco-orally transmitted diseases such as Salmonella.

Free-stall housing, associated primarily with large herds, presents considerable challenges when combating manure-transmitted pathogens. Freedom of movement in free-stall barns allows cattle to have direct contact with manure from other members of the herd, and it facilitates fecal contamination of common feed and water sources. Disposal of manure in liquid form by irrigation or application of slurry (as opposed to use of a broadcast or solid spreader to discard manure) has also been associated with Salmonella shedding. Manure in liquid form may be conducive to Salmonella persistence and can be dispersed broadly into the environment, increasing the likelihood of cattle exposure to the organism. Use of sprinklers or misters for heat abatement during the warmer months has also been associated with Salmonella-positive herd status. It is possible that this is related to the ability of Salmonella to thrive in moist environmental conditions. Alternatively, use of heat abatement practices may simply be a proxy for warmer geographic regions where Salmonella prevalence tends to be higher. Other herd-level risk factors for Salmonella shedding include lack of an enclosed building for feed storage and cow access to surface water such as ponds and streams, underscoring the importance of biosecurity measures. Finally, feeding anionic salts to cows near the time of parturition was found to be a risk factor for Salmonella-positive herd status, although the mechanism underlying this association is unclear.

Illness occurs primarily in calves younger than 3 months of age, and the predominant clinical manifestation is febrile respiratory illness rather than GI disease. This serovar is particularly challenging because of its tendency to yield chronic, subclinical carriers that continuously or intermittently shed high numbers of organisms into the environment. These carrier animals play a key role in maintaining infection in dairy herds via shedding of S. Dublin in feces, milk, and colostrum. Some cattle remain carriers for life. Mature cattle at highest risk for becoming S. Dublin carriers include heifers infected between 1 year of age and first calving as well as cows infected near the time of calving. The association between infection around the time of calving and becoming a carrier underscores the potential role of physiologic stress in the pathogenesis of the carrier status. Occurrence of an outbreak of clinical disease has also been reported to be a herd-level risk factor for carrier development. Among dairy herds with a history of previous S. Dublin infection, successful control has been associated with avoidance of purchasing cattle from herds identified as S. Dublin positive and use of appropriate management strategies in the calving area, such as applying suitable hygienic measures and refraining from placing sick cattle in this area. S.

Individual patients may be treated aggressively after acid-base and electrolyte assessment. However, outbreaks in field settings seldom allow extensive ancillary workup, and fluid therapy is administered empirically. Use of balanced electrolyte solutions such as lactated Ringer's solution is sufficient for most cattle. Cattle having severe acute diarrhea and >10% dehydration are likely to have metabolic acidosis and may require supplemental bicarbonate therapy. For example, a 600-kg patient judged to be 10% dehydrated and mildly acidotic (base excess = -5.0 mEq/L) should receive 60 L of balanced fluids for correction of dehydration. Rehydration alone may decrease the lactic acid and correct the metabolic acidosis. (The only times that IV bicarbonate therapy is absolutely needed for correction of acidosis in dairy cattle are in the treatment of severe rumen acidosis, enterotoxigenic E. coli, or other enteric infections causing excessive production of D-lactate.) If balanced electrolyte fluid therapy does not correct the metabolic acidosis, the cow may however benefit from the administration of bicarbonate. The hypothetical 600 kg cow has 200 kg or L of ECF (0.3 [ECF] X 600), and the base deficit of -5.0 mEq/L implies that each liter of her ECF is in need of 5.0 mEq/L HCO 3 -. Thus 1000 mEq NaHCO 3 (0.3 X 600 X 5 mEq) could be added just to make up the existing deficit, and more NaHCO 3 would likely be necessary to compensate for anticipated continued losses. This example readily highlights the feeling of helplessness that veterinarians and herd owners experience when a virulent serotype causes serious dehydration in more than a few cows. Jugular vein catheter placement may allow for repeated administration of IV fluids and repeated IV administration of flunixin meglumine. Hypertonic saline (7.5 times normal) administered at 3 to 5 mL/kg followed by 10 to 20 gallons of oral electrolyte solution, either consumed voluntarily or given by orogastric tube, is a highly practical method of fluid resuscitation in a field setting. This method has become commonplace and is a time-and labor-efficient way of addressing dehydration in grade cattle. Placement of a catheter in an auricular vein may prevent catheter damage from head catches, a common problem with jugular catheters on dairies. Administration of hypertonic saline into smaller diameter veins, such as the auricular vein, may result in phlebitis and catheter failure. When multiple animals merit oral fluid administration during an outbreak of salmonellosis or any other contagious enteric disease or if the same equipment is to be used for drenching of other cattle, laypeople should be aggressively educated as to the possibility of cross-contamination and the need for disinfection between uses. As a crude rule of thumb, cattle that show no voluntary interest in drinking after rapid IV administration of 3 to 5 mL/kg of 7.5 times normal saline solution should provisionally be given at best a guarded prognosis and are mandatory candidates for large-volume oral fluid drenching.",

In other words, clinicians can seldom accurately predict which patients with salmonellosis are truly septicemic.

These points should be considered by veterinarians and probably dictate against the use of antibiotics in patients with salmonellosis having mild to moderate signs (e.g., low-grade fever, diarrhea, and mild dehydration).

Because removal of organic debris is incomplete on some surfaces, use of a disinfectant that retains its activity in organic debris and that has documented efficacy against Salmonella spp. is optimal. Because shedding is likely to occur from recovered cattle for some time, ongoing efforts at improved hygiene are in order. In particular, protect dry cows and disinfect maternity areas. 6. After resolution of the outbreak or crisis period, a mastitis survey should be conducted that includes bulk tank surveillance.

Although the efficacy and safety of autogenous bacterins are (justifiably) questioned, many practitioners have claimed excellent results when all other measures fail to stop ongoing endemic infections when freshening cows become ill, abortions continue to appear, or calves continue to become ill because of salmonellosis. The siderophore receptor/porin vaccine derived from S. Newport (Salmonella Newport Bacterial Extract, Zoetis Inc., Kalamazoo, MI) is used by many dairies as a component of Salmonella control. The product is typically administered to dry cows as an initial two injection primary series and then boostered annually, although it can be given at any stage of lactation, or to heifers. Although it does not prevent infection, it is often associated with amelioration of disease severity and clinical impact after an outbreak or on endemic farms. The efficacy of J-5 vaccines in salmonellosis control in adult cattle is unknown. Unfortunately, it is difficult to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines used to control endemic salmonellosis in field settings because improvement may be attributed to the vaccine but influenced by herd immunity or alterations in management. (For a further discussion of vaccinations for salmonellosis, see the section on calf salmonellosis.) Prevention in adults is best accomplished by maintaining a closed herd and maintaining good general health and nutritional management of the late dry period and early lactation cattle. It is inevitable that dairy cattle will be exposed to multiple serotypes of Salmonella on many dairies, and the highest risk population for clinical disease are cattle in the late transition period through the first few weeks of lactation. Excellent husbandry, augmented by facilities and practices that allow identification and separation of affected individuals, will position producers to minimize the health and economic impacts of the disease.",

Other names given to HBS include jejunal hemorrhage syndrome, bloody gut, dead gut, and clostridial enteritis. HBS is characterized by sudden, progressive, and occasionally massive hemorrhage into the jejunum, with subsequent formation of clots within the intestine that create obstruction. Affected areas of the intestine can become necrotic, and affected cows appear to suffer from the combined effects of blood loss, intestinal obstruction, and devitalization of bowel.

The intestine orad to these lesions may be distended with fluid and gas, indicating obstruction of affected segments. Fibrin accumulation on the serosal surface of affected intestine may be evident, and affected segments may rupture antemortem or postmortem. The blood clot in affected segments is often tenaciously attached to the mucosa, and manual removal of the clot often results in \"peeling off\" of the surrounding mucosa ( Fig. 6.38) .

Sloughing of mucosa in affected areas may also be present. A recent retrospective pathologic report demonstrated consistent splitting of the muscularis mucosae or lamina propria from the muscularis layer in the jejunum by hematoma formation without significant inflammation, suggesting that the hemorrhage begins in the lamina propria secondary to a disturbance in blood or lymphatic flow.

            "text": "Cattle with HBS are typically first noted by owners to be colicky with a rapid pulse and elevated respiratory rate consistent with abdominal pain. The onset is classically peracute, many cattle having been normal, appetent, and high producing at the previous milking. The severity of the colic can be variable from bruxism with kicking at the abdomen through to recumbency and rolling. The cow's extremities are often cool, and the rectal temperature is often below normal. The most significant initial differentials are simple indigestion or obstructive conditions of the small intestine. Retrospective studies have highlighted that this condition tends to be seen during midlactation, affected dairy cows often being between the third and fifth months of lactation. Fecal production and character in affected cattle is very helpful; in the early stages, cattle often have scant to absent manure, but over the following hours, feces become dark and tarlike and may contain dark red to black clots of digested blood (Fig. 6.39) . The admixture of fresh, as well as digested blood, distinguishes the condition from bleeding of purely abomasal origin. As clots form in the affected segments of the intestine, the intestine often becomes obstructed, causing some cows to show abdominal distension and subsequently, reduced fecal output. Even in cattle that do continue to pass some feces, bilateral abdominal distension and sucussible fluid in the right ventral quadrant are consistently seen in association with ileus and rumen hypomotility. When viewed from behind, the abdominal contour is typically round or pear shaped in the standing animal. Progressive distension is often appreciated in the lower right abdomen, resulting from accumulation of multiple loops of blood-filled small intestine and ileus in the ventral abdominal cavity. Scattered, low-pitched \"pings\" may be evident in the lower right abdomen. In our experience, rectal examination often does not reveal distended loops of intestine because the blood-filled segments of intestine seem to sink to the ventral abdomen, thereby becoming beyond the reach of the examiner. However, small intestinal distension was palpable per rectum in six of eight cows in a Canadian study. Cows with HBS generally have elevated heart rate, normal or subnormal rectal temperature, and little or no interest in feed, but these findings are similar in most diseases that cause small intestinal obstruction. Blood work on affected cattle is neither specific nor prognostically helpful. It is unusual for affected cattle to bleed sufficiently to become anemic, and electrolyte and acid-base changes are usually only mild and typical of other proximal GI conditions in cattle.",

Cattle with enteritis continue to pass significant quantities of feces, particularly after treatment with fluids and calcium salts, but cattle with HBS usually do not.

At surgery, intraoperative findings depend on the extent of clot formation within the intestine and duration of the condition. The serosal surface of affected segments is often dark red, to purple, to black in color, depending on the degree to which the bowel has become compromised. In longstanding cases the affected segments of intestine may be very turgid with luminal blood and highly friable, with the serosal surface already coated with fibrin. The casts of clotted blood within the lumen of the intestine impart a gelatin-like feel to the affected bowel (Fig. 6.41) . When there is extensive involvement of multiple segments of jejunum or if extension into the ileum or duodenum has occurred, there will be no opportunity for intestinal resection and anastomosis. Other earlier cases may have fluid filled jejunum proximal to a short segment of intraluminal clot within bowel that looks much healthier. Techniques for surgical management of HBS cases to date include manipulation of the affected intestine to break down the obstructing clots, enterotomy and removal of the offending clots, and resection and anastomosis of affected segments. At the University of Wisconsin, we routinely attempt manual reduction of the clot(s) without enterotomy at initial surgical exploration and caution owners about the challenges and much poorer outcomes experienced with resection and anastomosis. With manual massage alone, we have a success rate of about 60% to discharge from the hospital, although it should be noted that of these short-term survivors, there is a recurrence rate that approximates 25% over the future life of the cow. Surgical therapy is combined with high-dose penicillin, one to two treatments with flunixin meglumine at 1.1 mg/kg, IV crystalloids, and oral cathartic laxatives.

Nonetheless, potential risk factors for clostridial overgrowth in the intestine of ruminants have been identified in previous studies, and strategies to reduce those risks might, at least in theory, provide benefits in HBS control. Similarly, the potential role of pathogenic fungi in HBS warrants careful consideration when designing preventive strategies. In short, until more defined information regarding the cause of HBS is published, it may be best to first consider all proposed causes or risk factors (e.g., anaerobic bacteria, fungi, and reduced host disease resistance) and take measures to mitigate these potential risk factors. In so doing, one should consider (1) identifying and correcting management and environmental factors that might impair cow immunity, (2) performing a careful partial budget analysis of the cost of specific preventive measures, and (3) deciding on which specific corrective measure(s) might be most justified for a particular dairy.",

Feed bunk and pen management should be carefully critiqued to ensure that feed intake is consistent; efforts should focus on identifying and correcting management problems that cause \"slug feeding\" (e.g., pen overcrowding, poor parlor throughput, and infrequent feeding) and that predispose to subacute rumen acidosis. Silage management, commodity storage, and feed preparation should be examined to determine whether spoilage and mold formation are problematic. Because these critical areas impact numerous facets of cow health other than HBS, identification and correction of problems in these areas will likely provide an overall benefit to cow health.

There is no reason to believe that commercial toxoids directed against C. perfringens types C and D would be helpful in controlling this disease.

This initial disease was highly infectious and contagious and imparted high mortality. The causative organism was later isolated and so began the prolific longterm research into this pathogen of cattle. The initial clinical descriptions of BVD by Fox were of a severe disease characterized by high fever, diarrhea, mucosal lesions, and leukopenia. However, throughout the period from 1950 to 1975, the disease was largely disregarded in parts of the United States-including the northeast-because serologic surveys suggested that most adult cows had serum neutralization titers against BVDV. These results were interpreted to mean that BVDV frequently infected cattle as a subclinical or mild infection and was of little clinical significance. A direct consequence of this thinking was a nearly complete lack of interest in vaccination of dairy cattle against BVDV. The major clinical evidence of BVDV during the years 1950 to 1975 was sporadic subacute or chronic infection in one or more heifers on a farm. These affected animals usually were between 6 and 24 months of age; they developed diarrhea, typical mucosal lesions, fever, and weight loss and survived in poor condition for a variable time before death. Because of the sporadic appearance of such cases, these animals were thought to be immunodeficient and therefore susceptible to BVDV. This theory was tenable for single-case infections but became less believable when four to six heifers on one farm developed similar signs because the likelihood of multiple immunodeficient animals on one farm seemed small.",

Virologic limitations at many diagnostic laboratories during this period added further confusion to the disease clinically referred to as BVD or mucosal disease. Diagnosis was based primarily on serum neutralization titers and FA procedures on tissue samples rather than viral isolation. Current knowledge helps explain why so many of these clinically obvious BVD patients had low or nonexistent serum neutralization (SN) titers against BVDV.

This fatal disease may follow an acute, subacute, or chronic course and is frequently characterized by fever, diarrhea, weight loss, mucosal ulcerations of the GI tract, digital lesions, or dermatologic lesions.

This variation is more likely explained by multiple strains of NCP-BVDV and CP-BVDV, some of which appear to have a degree of organ specificity. Obviously, previous exposure of cattle to BVDV through natural exposure or vaccination, other diseases that exist concurrent to BVDV exposure, the age and genetics of the cattle, and the strain of BVDV all have a great influence on the clinical picture created when a group or herd of cattle is exposed. There is no question, however, that within each herd having detectable clinical disease associated with BVDV, the specific clinical signs of disease are repeatable. For example, herds with abortions as a common finding will continue to see abortion, and herds with calves affected with congenital lesions will continue to see such calves without necessarily having cows affected with high fever and diarrhea. Thus, it is unusual to see multiple clinical scenarios within a single herd experiencing disease caused by BVDV. A specific \"set\" or pattern of signs is more typical, and clinicians never should underestimate the ability of BVDV infection to assume multiple appearances. Future research may allow further distinction of BVDV strains capable of producing specific clinical signs such as thrombocytopenia, specific congenital anomalies, abortions, or GI disease. The disturbing implications of multiple BVDV strains-each possibly possessing individual pathogenicity-center on the consequential need for vaccines that can protect cattle and their fetuses against the heterogenous array of BVD viruses.",

Immunosuppression that follows BVDV infection occurs because of a combination of lymphocyte depletion and impairment of both innate and acquired immune responses. Highly virulent strains of BVDV are often associated with profound suppression of T helper cell responses alongside increased apoptosis of both B and T cells through downregulation of major histocompatibility complex II and interleukin-2. These effects help explain the enhanced morbidity and mortality seen when herds experience concurrent exposure to other pathogens such as Mannheimia and Salmonella spp. Immunosuppression may also be an explanation as to why PI animals suddenly develop pneumonia or other infectious diseases when in contact cattle remain normal.",

Frequently, it is emphasized that most na\u00efve cattle or calves experimentally infected with BVDV show little if any evidence of illness yet seroconvert and develop neutralizing antibodies against the infecting strain of BVDV. Such subclinical infection and absence of overt disease also may occur in field situations. However, many other factors such as the age of the animal, concurrent diseases or stresses, relative exposure, dosage, strain and biotype of BVDV, herd and individual cow immune status from previous exposure to BVDV via natural or vaccination means, and presence or absence of PI cattle in the herd must be considered in field situations. As discussed previously, herds experiencing clinical disease because of BVDV will tend to establish a specific pattern of signs rather than variable signs. Clinicians must keep an open mind when considering BVDV as a cause of disease because the signs may be so variable. New signs of BVDV may emerge as more strains evolve. Much of the available experimental data with BVDV has been generated using a limited number of strains. These strains may or may not cause signs similar to wild or field strains. Certain field strains seem capable of causing specific clinical signs. For example, a field strain of NCP-BVDV (genotype 2) found to cause thrombocytopenia clinically was able to create thrombocytopenia in experimentally infected cattle. However, it is obvious that not all strains of BVDV cause thrombocytopenia.",

Because many, if not most, acutely infected cattle show lesions in neither area, clinicians must maintain an index of suspicion based on other signs (e.g., fever, diarrhea) and examine as many affected animals as possible. In some herds having this form of BVDV, only recently fresh cows develop signs, and these affected fresh cows are observed sporadically rather than as an epidemic. Morbidity and mortality levels vary with the classical acute illness but both usually range from 10% to 30%. Occasional catastrophic outbreaks with much higher mortality rates are still encountered in na\u00efve or highly stressed groups of cattle. When present, oral erosions are much less obvious than those observed in pathology texts or in chronic or classic mucosal disease (Fig. 6.42) . Focal or multifocal erosions can occur anywhere in the oral cavity and are most common on the hard or soft palates. Hyperemia and erosive changes on the papillae near the lip commissures are sometimes apparent. The papillae may be blunted, shortened, or simply have erosions on the apical portion, causing these areas to appear much more pink or red than the bases (Fig. 6.43) . Erosions at the gingival area adjacent to the incisor teeth may occur but sometimes are difficult to interpret because of the natural pink appearance of the gingiva adjacent to the teeth. Close inspection of this area will distinguish sloughing epithelium and erosions from the normal healthy pink mucosa (Fig. 6.44) . Both the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the tongue should be examined carefully for ulcers (Fig. 6.45) . Slight to moderate salivation may be observed in cattle with oral erosions, and grinding of the teeth may indicate pain caused by other GI lesions. Digital lesions are infrequent in adult cattle experiencing acute BVDV infection, but when present, they appear as coronary band hyperemia, exudation and erosion, or interdigital erosions. Lameness is a distinct sequela to such lesions. The character of the feces in BVDV patients with diarrhea varies from simply loose to watery, and blood or mucus may be apparent in severe cases or in those having thrombocytopenia. Tenesmus may develop secondary to profuse diarrhea and rectal irritation and may be confused with signs of coccidiosis. Leg edema and dermatitis may be noticeable in some PI animals. Ocular discharge may occur in some severely affected cattle.",

            "text": "Immunocompetent seronegative cows exposed to strains of BVDV capable of causing classical acute signs usually seroconvert and survive. However, some seronegative non-PI cows exposed to these viruses become seriously ill and may die. Some NCP-BVDV strains possess sufficient pathogenicity to kill adult, immunocompetent, seronegative cattle. This fact was highlighted by the 1994 epidemic of BVD in Ontario and the northeastern United States. Therefore, a cow or calf does not have to be PI to be killed by a field strain of BVDV. Fatal consequences of BVDV (other than superinfection of PI animals) can occur directly as a result of BVDV-induced thrombocytopenia with subsequent hemorrhage; electrolyte, fluid, and protein losses caused by severe diarrhea; and other causes. Most commonly, however, fatal consequences of BVDV are secondary to opportunistic pathogens creating concurrent infection during BVDV viremia. Even immunocompetent healthy cattle suffer profound alterations in innate and acquired immune defense mechanisms during the time between the onset of BVDV infection and humoral antibody production or recovery. Most healthy cattle exposed to BVDV infection survive this time uneventfully, but less fortunate ones may develop pneumonia, mastitis, metritis, or other bacterial infections while viremic. Temporarily altered cellular immunity affects lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages and may predispose to bacteremia or interfere with clearance of circulating microbes. The clinical consequence of this temporary lapse in cellular defenses is an inability of such patients to overcome routine infections. Cattle infected with BVDV experimentally may or may not be exposed to other routine infections, but cattle naturally infected with BVDV are subject to multiple stresses and infections. During the period of viremia and altered cellular defense, dairy calves and cows may succumb to IBR virus, other enteric pathogens (especially Salmonella spp.), bacterial mastitis, bacterial pneumonia, and other infections. High mortality rates have been observed when BVDV and Salmonella spp. concurrently infect groups of calves or cows. Recently assembled herds or purchased groups of replacement heifers may trigger severe disease by introducing a new strain of BVDV to a resident herd. Immune responsiveness returns to normal as BVDV infection wanes and serum neutralization titers against the virus increase. Therefore, seronegative immunocompetent cattle infected with BVDV do not have any residual or permanent immunodeficiency after resolution of the infection and seroconversion. Both increased severity of concurrent disease and lack of responsiveness to conventional therapy for that disease may be seen during the window of time that a patient is viremic with BVDV. Concurrent infections such as IBR or pneumonia caused by Mannheimia haemolytica in animals viremic with BVDV may be so severe as to mask the underlying BVDV because signs of illness or postmortem lesions incriminate respiratory pathogens as the cause of illness. Failure of these more obvious infections to respond to conventional therapy should raise the index of suspicion regarding BVDV infection. For example, a severe outbreak of M. haemolytica pneumonia masked underlying BVDV in a herd that had recently added 20 replacement heifers. Cultures obtained from affected cattle via tracheal washes and necropsy, confirmed M. haemolytica sensitive to several antibiotics. The indicated antibiotics had been used to treat affected animals, but the expected clinical response was not obtained. Mucosal lesions subsequently were found in a few of the fatal cases, and an NCP-BVDV was isolated from the buffy coat of several affected animals.",

Conditions such as stress, injections, trauma, or insect bites that may contribute to clinical signs of bleeding in thrombocytopenic clinical patients may not be present in experimental models. Thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding causes blood loss anemia, and is commonly fatal unless treated with fresh whole blood transfusions. Thrombocytopenia occurs as a result of viral infection and destruction of megakaryocytes in bone marrow. Dysfunction of circulating platelets may contribute to clinical signs of impaired coagulation. Field outbreaks of acute BVDV with thrombocytopenia are characterized by one or more of the affected cattle having signs of epistaxis, bloody diarrhea, bleeding from injection or insect bite sites, ecchymoses and petechial hemorrhages on mucous membranes, or hematoma formation (Figs. 6.47 and 6.48). Not all infected cattle show signs of bleeding, and the magnitude of thrombocytopenia varies greatly. In addition, inapparent infection with subsequent seroconversion may occur in some herdmates. However, when bleeding is associated with other clinical signs such as diarrhea, fever unresponsive to antibiotics, GI ulceration, and leukopenia, then BVDV should be strongly suspected. Platelet counts and identification of BVDV by RT-PCR, virus isolation from mononuclear cells in whole blood, or antigen detection by ELISA confirm the diagnosis.

The greatest risk for calves with acute BVDV infection is concurrent infection with other enteric or respiratory pathogens. Transient reduction of cellular immune function and defense mechanisms during BVDV viremia predispose to, and worsen, concurrent infection. Therefore, diarrheic neonatal calves (< 2 to 3 weeks of age) can have acute BVDV infection masked by identification of encapsulated E. coli, Salmonella spp., rotavirus, coronavirus, or C. parvum (Fig. 6.49) . Similarly, calves up to several months of age may have overt respiratory disease caused by Mannheimia spp., H. somni, or respiratory viruses that are isolated from tracheal wash or necropsy specimens. In all of these situations, concurrent BVDV should be suspected when the severity of disease, morbidity, and mortality seem excessive for the identified pathogens. Na\u00efve, non-PI calves born to seropositive cows should acquire passive antibody protection against homologous strains for at least 3 months and in some cases as much as 12 months. However, this passive protection may or may not protect against heterologous strains and may not be protective if calves receive less than adequate amounts of colostrum. In addition, overwhelming exposure to BVDV may override any passive protection in some instances. Seronegative calves are at risk at all times. Whenever severe calf mortality associated with enteric or respiratory pathogens occurs, BVDV should be considered and ruled in or out by viral isolation or PCR from blood, necropsy tissue samples, or tracheal wash samples. PI calves may appear normal at birth, grow normally, and become productive members of the herd. This situation is perhaps the most frightening because such PI cattle are not easily detected and continue to harbor and shed homologous BVDV through body secretions. Recent data suggest that up to approximately one quarter of PI animals will survive to adulthood (2 years or older), and if one uses an estimate of 1% PI animals in an untested cattle population, it is easy to see how destructive and threatening the PI status can be in both the dairy and beef industries. Apparently healthy PI cattle also reliably reproduce PI offspring that subsequently act as reservoirs of infection for herdmates. PI calves or cattle that are clinically normal may develop signs of acute or chronic (\"mucosal disease\") BVD if exposed to heterologous strains of CP-BVDV through natural exposure, administration of ML-BVDV vaccines, or genetic recombination of their homologous BVDV strain. In fact, the conversion to CP from NCP biotype probably most commonly occurs by insertions, deletions, and single nucleotide changes of the PI animal's own original strain.",

Pregnant adult cattle may experience subclinical infection that results in abortion or the subsequent birth of calves with congenital anomalies such as cerebellar hypoplasia, cataracts, retinal and optic nerve degeneration, hydranencephaly, hypomyelinogenesis, brachygnathism, varying degrees of hairlessness, and other congenital lesions (Figs. 6.54 to 6.56). It must be mentioned here that BVDV is not responsible for all congenital cataracts; there are many other causes.

Usually several consecutive calves are affected with the same type of congenital lesion. For example, in a herd that Dr. Rebhun investigated, brachygnathism and cataracts typified the congenital lesions, but in other herds, other ocular lesions or cerebellar hypoplasia may predominate. The strain of infecting BVDV certainly may play a role in determining the anatomic area of congenital malformation because some strains seem to possess a degree of organ specificity. Both CP and NCP strains are capable of inducing fetal anomalies. Most congenital lesions are thought to indicate in utero infection between days 80 to 150 of gestation. Overlap between this time and the period for persistent infection (40-125 days) exists. Therefore, calves born with congenital lesions may be PI or may be seropositive in precolostral blood samples depending on exactly when the in utero infection occurred and whether NCP or CP BVDV caused the congenital lesion. Calves with congenital lesions should be tested to determine whether they are PI, especially if the congenital lesions are not life threatening and the owner would like to keep the animal. ",

Unfortunately, this represents a distinct minority of the cases. Clinicians must remember that even in epidemic acute disease < 50% of infected cattle may have detectable lesions on clinical examination. In addition, because most cattle infected by strains of BVDV have subclinical or mild infections, signs suggestive of BVDV may be absent. Specific physical examination findings are limited to oral mucosal lesions and digital lesions. Such lesions may be obvious in superinfected PI animals having all of the signs of severe BVD (\"mucosal disease\") but may be subtle or absent in seronegative animals experiencing acute BVDV infection. Mucosal lesions also may lag behind nonspecific early signs of fever, depression, and reduced milk production. Whenever BVDV infection is suspected, a methodical examination of the oral cavityaided by focal light illumination-is essential if subtle erosions are to be found. Lesions can be in any area of the oral cavity, but focal erosions of the hard and soft palates, tongue erosions, erosions at gingival border of the incisor teeth, and blunted hyperemic papillae that are eroded at the tip are most commonly seen. Digital lesions are even less common than oral mucosal lesions in field outbreaks of BVDV. When present, coronitis and interdigital erosions are most common. Laminitis usually is observed only secondary to chronic coronitis in PI animals with superinfection. Although not widely practiced, endoscopy to see the esophageal mucosa might allow detection of typical linear erosions that are quite common in both acute and chronic infections (Fig. 6.58 ). Persistence of high fever or biphasic high fever occurring over more than 7 days is found in many acute BVDV infections. Initially, the affected animal may not appear seriously ill and may be thought to have a \"respiratory virus.\" If, however, fever persists and is unresponsive to antibiotics, these same cattle may show more overt anorexia, depression, and dehydration after several days. Diarrhea and mucosal lesions are more common at this time. Few diseases of dairy cattle cause the profound and complete anorexia observed in BVDV-infected cattle having mucosal GI lesions. Oral erosions, esophageal erosions, forestomach erosions, and lower GI lesions contribute to patient pain, discomfort, and subsequent anorexia. Salivation and bruxism also may be observed in these patients.",

The presence of virus in blood can be confirmed through submission of whole blood samples for viral isolation from the buffy coat or for detection of viral genetic material through PCR. Virus isolation is still considered the gold standard, but the use of RT-PCR has largely superseded virus isolation as the modern, accurate, and rapid test of choice.

A variety of samples including whole blood, serum, milk, semen, tracheal fluid, follicular fluid and tissue samples can be tested successfully by RT-PCR.

Test and cull practices in recent years in a growing number of European countries have proven that eradication is achievable but needs central or federal coordination and consistent producer and veterinarian attention to be successful. Even if eradication is not achieved, several countries have been able to reduce the prevalence of PI animals to less than 0.5% from prior levels that were 5 five 10 times as high by using rigorous herd level testing and removal of positive, proven PI animals. Undoubtedly there are now a large number of U.S. dairy herds that individually and informally have some form of PI screening, but it should be part of every herd's biosecurity protocol, independent of cow numbers. Large dairies that use heifer rearers or purchase replacement stock through markets have particular challenges in appropriately screening and \"protecting\" all pregnant animals from exposure to BVDV during early gestation. The incidence of acute BVDV clinical disease appears to have noticeably decreased over the past 2 decades, presumably because of better vaccination programs and both early detection and elimination of PI calves.",

Two fundamental challenges to effective vaccination for BVDV have existed historically. First, the broad antigenic diversity of BVDV makes it difficult to create a vaccine that induces immunity to all of the potential strains that a herd may encounter over time. Second, the massive amounts of virus shed by PI animals may result in infection even in immunized cattle. The importance of this second issue cannot be overemphasized. Exposure to viremic animals compromises any effort at complete protection of a herd through immunization, and elimination of PI animals from the herd is the vital step in BVDV control.",

With greater testing procedures available for extraneous virus testing, as well as higher standards for reagents such as fetal bovine serum for cell culture systems, the risk of live virus contamination of MLV has been greatly reduced compared to the past. To ensure that these precautions are used for a given product, safety data and quality control procedures for vaccine production should be requested from manufacturers of MLV vaccines. There is no doubt that the addition of safer, highly immunogenic MLV vaccines against BVDV in recent years has been a major step forward in the control of acute BVDV infection and the protection of fetuses against in utero exposure and PI. The evolution of BVDV vaccines in the United States has closely followed the antigenic changes in natural infection in the country. In the early 1990s when type 2 BVDV appeared for the first time, there was incorporation of type 2a strains along with the traditional type 1a strains already present into both killed and MLV products. Unfortunately, in recent years, there has been an increase in the prevalence of BVDV type 1b in the United States from natural cases. Although there is good experimental evidence to support cross protection against heterologous strains, one company (Elanco) has now produced a vaccine that contains type 1b BVDV. A recent, thorough meta-analysis examining the effectiveness of currently available BVDV vaccines to prevent reproductive disease concluded that polyvalent vaccines offered greater effective prevention against abortion and fetal infection compared to monovalent products and that the relative risk for abortion and fetal infection was lower with MLV compared with killed products. It is worth pointing out that the beneficial effect of the killed multivalent products was still significant, and it is very important to use MLV products according to label instructions regarding prior vaccination in particular.",

The producer must understand, however, that introduction of a novel strain of BVDV onto a farm may result in fetal infection in non-PI, pregnant females, warranting eventual testing of their offspring. 3. Screening of new animals for PI status before introduction into the herd. Reducing risk of introduction of BVDV is best accomplished by avoiding the purchase of untested cattle. Without question, the greatest disasters resulting from acute BVDV have followed the purchase of assembled cattle from sales to increase herd size. These purchased animals may be PI. Alternatively, they may be acutely infected-in either case, they represent sources of new virus for the herd. In addition, if newly purchased cows or heifers were exposed to BVDV and became viremic in early pregnancy, they may be carrying PI fetuses. Dr. Joe Brownlie in the United Kingdom, a worldrenowned expert on BVDV, aptly refers to these individuals as the \"Trojan cow\" of BVDV transmission. Therefore, for optimal herd protection, purchased adults should be tested before introduction into the herd; later, the offspring that they were carrying at the time of purchase should be tested for PI status too because PI calves can be born to immunocompetent dams. Whenever possible, new herd introductions should be tested and well isolated from the remainder of the herd for 4 to 6 weeks. During this period, any PI animals in the group of new introductions can be identified and removed, and any acutely infected animals can be given adequate time to recover. Any contact between isolated new introductions and the remainder of the herd, even at fence lines, should be avoided during this period.",

Implementation of biosecurity practices to prevent fetal exposure to BVDV.

Even with good vaccination practices, all immunity is finite, and overwhelming viral challenge could theoretically lead to transplacental passage of virus even in immunized, pregnant females.

Lymphocytic vasculitis of a variety of tissues is the classic microscopic lesion. Many ruminant species and pigs are susceptible to MCF viruses, and losses have been incurred on dairies, feed lots, ranches, game farms, zoos, and deer meat-raising facilities. It also causes high mortality rates in bison. Several epidemiologic forms of MCF exist, and they are classically defined by their reservoir ruminant species. In Africa, the causative agent has been isolated and identified as Alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 (AHV1). The term Alcelaphine relates to the subfamily of Bovidae, Alcelaphinae, in which wildebeest, hartebeest, and topi are classified. These species are thought to be the reservoir. The virus apparently is highly cell associated but can be spread during times of stress such as parturition or shipment and may be free in fetal fluids or the young of wildebeest.

Recent molecular studies have identified no significant difference in the genome of OvHV2 from sheep and a cow clinically affected by MCF. This suggests that the pathogenesis of sheep associated MCF is not associated with any genomic rearrangement as had been previously theorized. Even though OvHV2 cannot be cultured in vitro, its genome has been sequenced, allowing an increase in the amount and variety of research on the disease and potentially accelerating progress toward a vaccine.

In cattle, cases can be observed at any time of year, although in bison it has tended to be a late winter or early spring disease. In addition, some cattle that develop MCF have no historical direct or indirect exposure to sheep. Asymptomatic, persistent infections with OvHV2 in cattle may occur, and these infections may or may not develop into clinical MCF. Hence, the incubation period for this disease has been difficult to ascertain, with infected cattle developing disease weeks to months after exposure.

Airborne transfer of OvHV2 is suspected to occur over a distance of more than 70 m, so segregation of cattle from sheep by greater distances may be protective. This should be considered when housing cattle and sheep at fairs. For cattle and bison herds, Callan recommends a separation distance of 1 mile from sheep. Carrier (asymptomatically infected) cattle may be identified by CI-ELISA on serum and PCR on whole blood. The CI-ELISA test detects seroconversion in exposed individuals that may, owing to varying viral loads in blood, be intermittently negative by PCR on whole blood. Alternatively, acutely infected animals may be positive on PCR but negative on CI-ELISA owing to the delays inherent in generation of an immune response. Therefore, application of both tests may provide optimal sensitivity for detecting infected cattle. Although OvHV2 DNA can be detected in milk, nasal secretions, and ocular secretions of asymptomatic and clinically affected cattle, this viral DNA appears to be cell associated and does not pose a significant risk for horizontal transmission. Transmission from cattle or bison to other animals has not been demonstrated and is considered likely to be a rare event, if it occurs at all.",

Although regarded as primarily an enteric infection, as the infection progresses MAP may spread via macrophages in blood or lymph to other important sites such as supramammary lymph nodes, mammary gland, (and milk), and uterus (and fetus). Regional surveillance of Pennsylvania and, indirectly, other areas of the northeastern United States confirmed a dairy cow prevalence of up to 7.3% in many areas. With ever increasing dairy herd size, largely the consequence of purchase of cows of unknown status, the herd prevalence will continue to increase. In the United States, MAP-related average costs have been estimated to lie between $22 and $27 per cow per year, but the economic impact of the disease in positive herds versus confirmed negative herds is much higher and may exceed $100 per cow per year when infection progresses to clinical signs of disease. Without question, this disease is of tremendous economic importance to the entire cattle industry and especially to the dairy industry. ",

The subsequent course of infection is determined by numerous factors, including the dose of MAP organisms ingested and the animal's individual susceptibility to MAP, which in turn is determined by the age of the animal and the ability of its innate and adaptive immune responses to control MAP. Resistance to MAP infection is estimated to have approximately 10% heritability. Thus, in some exposed animals, MAP organisms will be contained or eliminated by macrophages, and infection will not become established, but in others, the infection will ultimately progress. In the early stages of infection, macrophages are activated by interferon-\u03b3 produced by Th1 helper lymphocytes and limit proliferation of the MAP and thereby its spread to other sites. However, the immune response to control MAP results in \"collateral damage,\" inciting a granulomatous response within the intestinal mucosa. This is characterized by progressive infiltration by epithelioid cells, multinucleate giant cells, and lymphocytes surrounding MAP-laden macrophages. In this early stage of infection (\"eclipse phase\"), during which MAP organisms are slowly proliferating and the inflammatory process is slowly progressing, no clinical signs are observed. The animals are outwardly healthy, fecal shedding of MAP rarely occurs, and serum antibodies are not produced. This makes it very difficult to diagnose the infection at this stage.",

Factors that contribute to clinical disease versus asymptomatic infection are not known but probably include organism dose, age at infection, nutrition, concurrent diseases, stresses, and genetics. Infected cattle shed MAP in their manure and transmit the disease to herdmates by MAP contamination of the environment. Herd infection prevalence varies from 20% to 100% in heavily infected herds. Despite this rather high incidence of infection, it is unusual to see clinical signs in more than 5% to 10% of adult cows in the herd per year. Johne's disease has been shown to persist in some herds for more than 10 years with no overt clinical signs of infection. 2. It is widely accepted that cattle that develop clinical signs shed large numbers of organisms and represent the greatest threat to contaminate the environment. Super-shedders may shed MAP in higher concentrations (1-5 million CFU/g of manure) than cattle with clinical disease. Potentially, these animals represent the greatest source of environmental contamination and reservoir for possible transmission to herdmates. Most super-shedders are asymptomatic with no evidence of diarrhea or weight loss yet excrete huge numbers of MAP organisms into the environment. 3. Passive shedding of MAP may occur when noninfected cattle ingest manure contaminated forage or water. With a super-shedder in the herd, ingestion of as little as 5 mL of manure contamination in forage may result in passive shedding and give rise to a positive fecal culture for a previously uninfected cow. The risk of misclassification of such cattle must be considered when control programs include fecal cultures of all adult animals and culling decisions are based on the results. It is possible that this phenomenon may represent 50% of all culture-positive cattle in the herd when a supershedder is present.",

It will stain the rear quarters if the tail switches liquid feces onto the quarters, flanks, and gluteal region. There is typically no blood or mucus present, and the animal is afebrile and does not exhibit tenesmus. However, given today's laxative diets, the diarrhea observed in a patient with Johne's disease is best described as looser compared with herdmates. The animal maintains a good appetite and remains well hydrated but has a significant decline in milk production and rapid loss of body condition. As well as temperature, other vital signs are normal. Moderate to advanced clinical cases have obvious weight loss characterized by muscle wasting, a poor dry hair coat, significant production losses, dehydration, and reduced feed intake, particularly high-energy feedstuffs (Fig. 6.63 ). Protein-losing enteropathy leads to hypoproteinemia with submandibular and brisket edema. Ventral edema is apparent but may vary in the anatomic area involved. Intermandibular, brisket, ventral, udder, and lower limb edema all are possible ( Fig. 6.64) . Clinical laboratory tests reveal hypoalbuminemia and possibly anemia of chronic disease.

This would imply extremely heavy environmental contamination with Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis. cows suggest a much lower dose of MAP or older age at the time of exposure. Thus, the age of onset of clinical signs will assist an astute clinician as to the severity of the herd problem. Age of onset is probably affected by many factors, such as dose and duration of exposure to infectious organisms, nutrition, genetics, concurrent diseases or stresses, and other factors. The clinical impression that signs frequently develop after the onset of lactation in the first, second, or third lactations suggests lactational stress may be sufficient to amplify subclinical signs and hypoproteinemia to a clinical state. It also is possible that this observation is simply a reflection of closer monitoring of appetite, production, and body condition in lactating animals as opposed to heifers or dry cows. Lactation stress is not a prerequisite to the development of clinical signs, as proven by bulls and steers having clinical Johne's disease.

Either ELISA or fecal PCR perform well for this purpose because both have high sensitivity and specificity in evaluation of clinically affected cattle. In contrast, when screening asymptomatic cows in infected herds to assist with culling decisions or biosecurity issues such as maternity pen and colostrum management, organism detection tests are more sensitive than ELISA but may be cost prohibitive and may be positive in passively shedding, noninfected cattle. A cost effective approach is to use milk ELISA, using not just the dichotomous results (i.e., \"positive\" or \"negative\") but using the quantitative result (optical density (OD) value or sample to positive (S/P) ratio), recognizing that the strongest reactors are most likely to be heavy fecal shedders and pose the greatest risk for contaminating the environment with MAP. Unfortunately, neither organism detection tests nor antibody tests are useful in screening asymptomatic young cattle (<3 years of age) as herd replacements or for use as embryo transfer recipients because cattle at this age are usually in the \"eclipse\" phase of infection and will be test negative even if infected.

Clofazimine is an antileprosy drug that has been successfully used to treat Johne's disease at a dose of 2 mg/kg, orally every 24 hours, alone or in combination with other antimicrobials. Resolution of diarrhea and improvement in plasma total protein can be observed within 2 weeks of starting treatment, although fecal shedding may continue. The drug is no longer available from commercial sources in the United States, so alternative antimycobacterial medications such as isoniazid (10-20 mg/kg orally every 24 hours) combined with rifampin (10 mg/kg orally every 24 hours) are often used. Rifampin usage in the United States currently requires a commitment from the producer that neither milk nor meat from that individual will ever be sold for human consumption, further diminishing the likelihood of dairy cattle ever being treated for this condition.",

Calves should be raised completely separately-preferably on a separate farm-from the adult cattle. All calves should be fed colostrum from ELISA-negative, or better, fecal culturenegative cows. Pooled colostrum feeding to calves should be avoided in herds with infected cattle. Colostral replacements could be used as a substitute for colostrum in herds with a high MAP incidence, but their use as a replacement for colostrum may lead to an increased incidence of other diseases in calves such as septicemia or diarrhea. Colostrum that is properly heat treated (60 min at 60\u00b0C and with constant stirring) will reduce the number of MAP but might not eliminate the organism completely from the colostrum. If whole milk is fed to calves in known infected herds, pasteurization should be considered. The purchase of replacement animals from herds of unknown Johne's disease status continues to represent the greatest risk to introduce or reintroduce MAP to such herds. Minimizing fecal contamination of feedstuffs, water, pastures, and exposure of calves to adult cow feces are essential and must be evaluated on an individual herd basis. Equipment used for manure removal or that could be contaminated by manure must remain separate from feeding implements and the calf environment. Although these principles for eradication are seemingly straightforward, they may not be practical or affordable in many instances. In between these two extremes, production herds that wish to \"contain\" the disease, to prevent the prevalence of MAP infection from increasing on the farm, and to reduce the risk of losing animals or milk production to clinical Johne's disease may use an intermediate approach. This may include identifying heavily infected animals through interpretation of milk or serum ELISA alongside management steps to reduce exposure of calves to MAP from feces of adult cows that are potentially shedding the organism. Additionally, these same herds may choose to sell heavy shedders (based on ELISA serology results) or clinical cases immediately, and moderate shedders would be culled at the end of their current lactation.",

However, it does not prevent infection with MAP, and vaccinated cattle can become infected and shed MAP in feces, although importantly the vaccine does prevent clinical disease in almost all recipients.

Vaccination is normally only used in herds experiencing significant losses caused by Johne's disease and should be combined with management changes designed to reduce the spread of infection between cattle. Permission from the state veterinarian is required, and a complete herd tuberculosis (TB) test must be performed before implementation.

In calves, liver abscesses are often the result of omphalophlebitis; in older cattle, they most often are secondary to reticulorumenitis. In feedlot cattle, it is well recognized that the change from pasture to a high-concentrate ration causes a rapid increase in rumen fermentation and organic acid production, which may result in erosion and inflammation of the rumen epithelium. Metastasis of bacteria from the inflamed and necrotic rumen wall to the liver occurs via the portal vein. In dairy cattle, similar failure of adaptation of rumen fermentation may occur at the onset of lactation when there is an abrupt increase in the energy content of the diet. Liver abscesses are therefore common potential sequelae to acute or subacute rumen acidosis; indeed, their presence in several cows within a herd should raise concern about nutritional management and the likelihood of subacute rumen acidosis as a herd problem. Liver abscesses also may occur as a result of traumatic reticulitis, where they tend to be an individual cow problem. The most common organisms isolated from hepatic abscesses are Fusobacterium necrophorum, Bacteroides nodosus, and Trueperella pyogenes.
