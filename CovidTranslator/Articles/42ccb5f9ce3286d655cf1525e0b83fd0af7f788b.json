The development of an FIP-preventive vaccine requires an antigen that does not induce antibody-dependent enhancement, and T helper (Th)1 activity plays an important role in protect against FIPV infection. In the present study, we identified synthetic peptides including Th1 and a linear immunodominant antibodybinding epitope in the S1 domain and M protein of FIPV. We also identified peptides that strongly induce Th1 activity from those derived from the structural proteins (S, M, and N proteins) of FIPV based on this and previous studies (Satoh et al. [19]). No Th1 epitope-containing peptide was identified in the peptides derived from the S1 domain of type I FIPV. In contrast, 7 Th1 epitope-containing peptides were identified in the S1 domain of type II FIPV, and no linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitope was contained in any of these peptides. Eleven Th1 epitope-containing peptides common to each serotype were identified in the M protein-derived peptides, and 2 peptides (M-11 and M-12) contained the linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitope. Of the peptides derived from the S, M, and N proteins of FIPV, those that induced significantly stronger Th1 activity than that of the FIPV antigen were rescreened, and 4 peptides were identified. When 3 of these peptides (M-9, I-S2-15, and II-S1-24) were selected and administered with CpG-ODNs to SPF cats, M-9 and II-S1-24 induced Th1 activity. Our results may provide important information for the development of a peptide-based vaccine against FIPV infection.",

            "text": "Feline coronavirus (FCoV) belongs to Alphacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. FCoV is mainly composed of nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and peplomer spike (S) protein [1] . FCoV is classified into serotypes I and II according to the amino acid sequence of its S protein [2, 3] . Both serotypes consist of two biotypes: feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). FECV infection is asymptomatic in cats. In contrast, FIPV infection causes a fatal disease called FIP. Cats that developed FIP were affected in several organs, and central nervous system, forming lesions accompanied by necrosis and pyogenic granulomatous inflammation [1] . Several studies have investigated potential vaccines to prevent FIP. Virulence-attenuated live or inactivated FIPV vaccines have been experimentally used for the prevention of FIP. However, none of these have exhibited a sufficient preventive effect and actually enhanced the development of FIP [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . When anti-FCoV antibody-positive cats were inoculated with FIPV, the onset time of FIP is earlier than that in antibody-negative cats, and symptoms are severer [11] . This phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection.",

In contrast, IFN-\u2425 production was not induced by inactivated-SARS-CoV in patients with a condition that progressed to a serious state or death after SARS-CoV infection. Based on the above findings, it was suggested that memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, i.e., the cellular immune response, may participate in viral clearance in recovered SARS patients. We similarly showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from FIPVinfected non-FIP cats specifically and significantly produced feline IFN-\u2425 (fIFN-\u2425) against heat-inactivated FIPV stimulation, while those from FIP cats did not [19, 20] . These results support the previous finding that T helper (Th)1 activity plays an important role in defense against FIPV infection. Thus, the induction of Th1 activity is essential for the development of vaccines against FIPV infection [1, [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

To achieve these conditions, we searched for a region containing the Th1 epitope, but no linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitope of the FIPV structural proteins using synthesized peptides. The amino acid sequence of the S1 domain of the S protein differs markedly between type I FIPV and II FIPV Fig. 4 . Th1-type immune response to the peptides of PBMCs isolated from cats vaccinated with 3 peptides and fCpG-ODNs in liposomes. Th1 activity-inducing I-S2-15, II-S1-24, and M-9 were mixed with fCpG-ODNs and subcutaneously administered twice to SPF cats (black bar) (n = 6). As a control, PBS was administered twice to SPF cats (white bar) (n = 6). PBMCs were subsequently collected from these cats. The cells were cultured with individual synthesized peptide, heat-inactivated FIPV as a positive control. The concentrations of fIFN-\u2425 were measured using sandwich ELISA. Bars represent the mean \u00b1 SEM. [2, 3] . Thus, 30 peptides of each serotype were synthesized for the experiment. No Th1 epitope-containing peptide was identified in the peptides derived from the S1 domain of type I FIPV. In contrast, 7 Th1 epitope-containing peptides were identified in the S1 domain of type II FIPV, and no linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitope was contained in any of these peptides. Twenty-two peptides covering the consensus amino acid sequence (40aa-260aa) between the serotypes were synthesized for the M protein based on the sequence of type I FIPV. Three peptides were synthesized for the N-terminal region (1aa-40aa) of the M protein for each serotype. Seven Th1 epitope-containing peptides common to each serotype were identified in the M protein-derived peptides, and 2 peptides (M-11 and M-12) contained the linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitopes.",

When a peptide that induced significantly stronger Th1 activity than that of the FIPV antigen was searched for, 4 peptides (M-6, M-9, I-S2-15, and II-S1-24) were subsequently identified. M-9 induced Th1 activity at a level similar to that of the initial screening. Whereas M-6 only weakly induced Th1 activity in type I FIPV-infected non-FIP cats, which differed from that of the initial screening. That is, the Th1 activity of M-6 might be unstable. Thus, M-6 was excluded from the experiment.",

Th1 activity was significantly induced in response to M-9 and II-S1-24, suggesting that M-9 and II-S1-24 may be applicable to a vaccine inducing FIPV antigen-specific Th1 cells. On the other hand, Th1 activity was not induced in response to I-S2-15. The reason why only I-S2-15 out of the 3 peptides did not induce Th1 activity was unclear. It is necessary to investigate the induction of Th1 activity in cats inoculated with I-S2-15 alone using the same method. Moreover, unlike the responses of FIPV-infected non-FIP cats, no fIFN-\u2425 production in response to heat inactivated-FIPV antigen was noted in cats administered with the peptides and fCpG-ODNs. We recently reported similar findings obtained in SPF cats immunized with peptides derived from N protein of FIPV KU-2 with fCpG-ODNs [30] . It is unclear why heat-inactivated FIPV antigen did not induce fIFN-\u2425 production in cats immunized with peptides with fCpG-ODNs. Further investigation is necessary to identify the reason.",
