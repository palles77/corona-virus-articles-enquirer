Thus far, no complications related to the steroids have been recorded in the mothers and infants, but their safety still needs more data to draw conclusions. Because of alterations in hormone levels and decreased lung volumes caused by increases in uterus size during pregnancy, patients might have a more rapid clinical deterioration. Additionally, the influence of the virus itself and these antivirals and Chinese medicines on fetal development is unknown. Therefore, for full-term pregnant women, after consultation with a multi disciplinary team, delivering as soon as possible might be a better choice for the sake of safety considerations. Timely use of antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infections and strengthen immune support treatment can reduce complications and mortality, so antibiotics were used routinely after operation. 15 COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy is a complicated clinical scenario, and a multidisciplinary team of medical personnel is needed to care for and treat these patients comprehensively. Relevant specialty areas include obstetrics, infectious diseases, internal medicine, paediatrics, anaesthesia, psychology, and infection control. No medical staff had SARS-Cov-2 infections during the whole treatment period. The sequence similarity between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 is as high as 79%; 16 the mortality rate of SARS infection is 10%, 17 and the mortality rate of SARS in pregnant women was 25%. 18 Studies have reported that the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 is about 1\u00b74%. 19 In our study, the maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia are better than those with SARS infection. This might be associated with our small number of cases and short delivery time (ie, as soon as possible after diagnosis). Previous studies have shown no evidence of perinatal SARS infection in infants born to mothers who had SARS infection during pregnancy. 18, 20 One neonate in our study was infected with COVID-19 36 h after birth. However, the viral nucleic acid tests of the placenta and cord blood in this patient were negative for SARS-CoV-2, so intrauterine vertical transmission might not have occurred; thus, further study is needed.",
