            "text": "The spike (S) gene of the attenuated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) DR13 was cloned and sequenced to further explore the functions of wild type PEDV and attenuated PEDV. Sequencing revealed a single large ORF of 4,149 nucleotides encoding a protein of 1,382 amino acids with predicted M r of 151 kDa. The coding region of the S gene of attenuated PEDV DR13 had 20 nucleotide changes that appeared to be significant determinants of function in that they produced changes in its predicted amino acid sequence. Notably, attenuated PEDV DR13 has previously been found to exhibit reduced pathogenicity in pigs. The regions containing these 20 nucleotide changes may therefore be crucial for PEDV pathogenicity. The attenuated PEDV DR13 S protein contains 28 Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons, 21 asparagines that are predicted to be N-glycosylated and a stretch of highly hydrophobic residues at positions 1,327-1,347, which is predicted to form an a-helix and to function as a membrane anchor. One (from N to K at 378) of the changes in the deduced amino acid sequence destroyed N-linked glycosylation sites, while another change (from N to S at 114) created a new one at a different location. These alterations in N-linked glycosylation sites reflected 3 nucleotide changes, which were related to the abovementioned nucleotide changes and are suggested to influence the pathogenicity of attenuated PEDV DR13. Attenuated PEDV DR13 has 96.5, 96.4, 96.1, 93.9, 93.5 and 96.6% DNA sequence identities with CV777, Br1/87, JS-2004-2, Spk1, Chinju99 and parent DR13, respectively. Likewise, it shares 95.7, 95.4, 95.6, 92.0, 91.6 and 95.7% identity with those genes at the deduced amino acid sequence level. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that attenuated PEDV DR13 is closely related to CV777, Br1/87, JS-2004-2 and parent DR13, rather than to Spk1 and Chinju99 and is especially close to the Chinese PEDV strain JS-2004-2.",

A single ORF of 4,149 nucleotides, with the potential to encode the coronavirus S protein, was identified [24] . The PEDV DR13 S gene had a sequence (GUAAAC) of 8 nucleotides upstream of the initiator ATG, as previously recognized in Br1/87 [10] . This sequence is a hexameric motif common to coronaviruses and is similar to the hexameric motifs XUA(A/G)AC found adjacent to other PEDV ORFs.

In the case of attenuated PEDV DR13, two (from N to K at 378, from T to I at 1,260) of the changes in the predicted amino acid sequence destroy N-linked glycosylation sites, while another change (from N to S at 114) creates a new glycosylation site when it compare to CV777 and Br1/87, respectively. There are two amino acid changes (from N to K at 378, from N to T at 1,193) destroying N-linked glycosylation sites and another change (from N to S at 114) creating a new glycosylation site when the attenuated PEDV DR13 is compared with parent PEDV DR13. Taken together, it appears that 2 nucleotide changes of 5 changes are thought to be simply strain differences because we reveal 1 nucleotide change (from A to C at 3,588) destroying Nlinked glycosylation site through amino acid change (from N to T at 1, 193) found in not other wild type PEDV but only parent PEDV DR13, and another change (from C to T, A in parent DR13 at 3,789) destroying N-linked glycosylation site through amino acid change (from T to I, N in parent DR13 at 1,260) found in both parent and attenuated PEDV DR13. Therefore, the fundamental cause of these differences in N-linked glycosylation sites was 3 nucleotide changes and these are suggested to influence the pathogenicity of attenuated PEDV DR13.

Asterisks represent (a) nucleotides and (b) amino acids that are identical to those in the attenuated PEDV DR13. Dashed lines represent missing (a) nucleotides and (b) amino acids compared to the PEDV CV777, Br1/87 and parent DR13 strains. Start codon ATG and stop codon TGA are underlined. Only the (a) 142 (146) and 141 nucleotides, and (b)59 (63) and 59 amino acids of CV777 (Br1/87) and parent DR13 which mismatched those of attenuated PEDV DR13 are included. Three missing nucleotides and one missing amino acids compared to the PEDV CV777, Br1/87 and parent DR13 strains are included. Regions corresponding to the six primers used for cloning are underlined and labeled above the sequence as SF1-3 and SR1-3. Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons in the sequence are underlined and bold letters indicate asparagine residues that are predicted to be Ndescribed above. Out of all differences, 50 nucleotide and 20 amino acid changes of the attenuated PEDV DR13 appear to be meaningful because we reveal other changes found in wild type PEDV, including JS-2004-2, Spk1, Chinju99 and parent DR13.",
