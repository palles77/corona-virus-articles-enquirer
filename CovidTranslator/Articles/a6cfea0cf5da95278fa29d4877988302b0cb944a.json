            "text": "The xTAG TM RVP Assay (RVP) is a multiplexed nucleicacid based molecular test capable of detecting 20 viruses and subtypes simultaneously in a single patient sample. The assay protocol is discussed elsewhere in this supplement. The present article describes the analytical performance and selected clinical results of this assay. Design requirements for the xTAG RVP Assay were established in consultation with leading clinical and laboratory experts in the field. As part of the design validation process, preclinical testing of the xTAG TM RVP Assay was carried out internally by the Research and Product Development departments at Luminex Molecular Diagnostics. This was followed by an external set of preclinical studies leading up to a multi-centre clinical trial to achieve FDA clearance. Taken together, the preclinical and clinical results validate the performance of the assay against its stated design requirements. The clinical multi-site trial is still ongoing but close to completion. Therefore, the final data summaries of the clinical trial are not included in this article, with the exception of the CE marked and FDA submitted analytical data. However, an earlier external evaluation of the xTAG TM RVP Assay, using clinical samples, was published by Mahony et al. (2007) . Of note is the fact that the data are derived from the same assay being evaluated in the FDA clinical trial, and the design of both studies is similar. Further performance data on the assay will be available by the time of publication of this supplement. Please contact Luminex Molecular Diagnostics or the last author of this article for further information.",

Initial data indicated that DFA/culture detected 119 positives and RVP detected 112 of these specimens. However, RVP also detected an additional 61 positive specimens not detected by DFA/culture. As a next step, all discordant samples were tested by specific reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR assays using unique primer pairs for each viral target that differed from the primers employed in the RVP assay. All of the 61 samples were confirmed as true positives by the RT-PCR methods.",

LoD studies support the superior analytical sensitivity of the assay when it is compared with DFA and culture. It should also be noted that the assay has a high degree of clinical specificity since background is generally very low at 10\u221220 MFI units compared to a typical positive signal at 1000 or more MFI units, giving an S/N ratio of over 100 for any positive viral target.

XTAG RVP also generates these results in 6\u22127 hours as compared to two or more days by culture -the current \"gold standard'. Studies reveal that RVP will likely detect >40% more respiratory viruses than DFA and culture due to its broader range of targets and its superior analytical sensitivity. With respect to RT-PCR methods, RVP is likely to be comparable in analytical sensitivity. However, the multiplexing capability of the assay will make the test a more powerful tool in a clinical or public health setting since it is important to be able to detect a broad range of viral targets simultaneously and determine which of those respiratory viruses are present for treatment purposes, infection control cohorting and reporting to public health (Flu A H5 and SARS-CoV).",
