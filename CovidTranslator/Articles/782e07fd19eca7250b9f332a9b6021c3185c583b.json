Here we identify a lncRNA as a key regulator of antiviral innate immunity. Following from the observation that a lncRNA that we call negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV) was dramatically downregulated during infection with several viruses, we ectopically expressed NRAV in human cells or transgenic mice and found that it significantly promotes influenza A virus (IAV) replication and virulence. Conversely, silencing NRAV suppressed IAV replication and virus production, suggesting that reduction of NRAV is part of the host antiviral innate immune response to virus infection. NRAV negatively regulates the initial transcription of multiple critical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFITM3 and MxA, by affecting histone modification of these genes. Our results provide evidence for a lncRNA in modulating the antiviral interferon response.",

Accumulating data indicate that they are an important class of regulatory RNAs in a variety of cellular processes (Mercer et al., 2009) . To serve the function of signaling, decoying, scaffolding, or guiding, lncRNAs employ their motifs to interact with other molecules (Guttman and Rinn, 2012; Wang and Chang, 2011) . Most recently, three lncRNAs (murine NeST, human THRIL, and NEAT1) are shown to regulate the innate immunity by modulating the transcription of IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL8, respectively (Cullen, 2013; Gomez et al., 2013; Imamura et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014) . In addition, mouse lincRNA-Cox2 plays a central role in control of the Pam3CSK4-induced inflammatory response (Carpenter et al., 2013) . Whole transcriptome studies have also demonstrated the differential expression of lncRNAs in SARS coronavirus-infected mice (Peng et al., 2010) and enterovirus 71-infected RD cells (Yin et al., 2013) , suggesting the functional involvement of lncRNAs in antiviral immunity. Interestingly, several lncRNAs have been shown to modulate viral infection. For example, 7SL and NEAT1 are evidenced to interfere with the HIV-1 virion package and posttranscriptional expression (Wang et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2013) . lncRNA VIN can facilitate influenza A virus (IAV) propagation (Winterling et al., 2014) . Despite these progresses, the specific functions of these lncRNAs in the host defense process remain incompletely characterized.",

            "text": "IAV infection poses a significant threat to global health (M\u00e4 nz et al., 2013) , but the mechanisms underlying IAV-host interaction are still elusive. Host anti-IAV response is initiated by the recognition of viral components by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation factor 5 (MDA5), and toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). Through the signaling cascade downstream the stimulated receptors, transcription factors including IRF3/7 and NF-kB are activated. Type I and III interferons (IFNs) are then rapidly produced, which induce the synthesis of hundreds of antiviral proteins encoded by IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Consequently, the accumulation of ISG proteins in cytosol, including the well-known IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats IFIT2, IFIT3 (Fensterl et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2011) , IFNinduced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) (Everitt et al., 2012) , and myxovirus resistance 1 (human MxA or mouse Mx1) (M\u00e4 nz et al., 2013) , provides antiviral protection through multiple mechanisms. Importantly, modulation of anti-IAV immunity epigenetically has emerged to be a critical mechanism. After the activation of transcription factors, a transcriptional regulation cascade is triggered (Smale, 2012). The cascade includes multiple waves of transcriptional activation and inhibition controlled by a complex network. First of all, regulations of promoter activity and chromatin structure are essential steps for the transcription initiation. For example, the activation of the promoters of immune genes ifit2, ifit3, and mx1 requires nucleosome remodeling through SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable (SWI/SNF) complexes and histone modifications (H3K4me3 or H3K9/K14ac) (Ramirez-Carrozzi et al., 2009) . IFN-g promoter is reported to be upregulated by lncRNA NeST, which binds with H3K4 methylase complex component WDR5 to alter histone methylation levels (Gomez et al., 2013) . In addition, the mRNA maturation and stabilization are also critical posttranscriptional regulation steps. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) regulate gene transcription and subsequent modification of the newly synthesized RNA (pre-mRNA) in nucleus. Recent studies have shown that hnRNP L and hnRNP A/B are associated with the induction of immunity genes TNF-a and CCL5 through interaction with lncRNA THRIL and lincRNA-Cox2, respectively (Carpenter et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014) . These data suggest that additional coregulators are required for transcriptional activation/inhibition of innate immunity genes.",

The human lncRNA gene nrav (LOC100506668, uc001tyk, also named as dynll1-as1) is located on chromosome 12q24.31, overlapping with the antisense strand of dynein light chain coding gene dynll1 within intron 1 ( Figure 1B) . No protein-coding potential was found in NRAV by analysis using ORF Finder (NCBI), coding potential calculator (score is \u00c00.743) (Figure S1C), and PhyloCSF (score is \u00c03452) (Lin et al., 2011) . Using polysome analysis, we further observed that NRAV displayed different distribution patterns in sucrose gradient fractions as compared with control protein-coding mRNA of GAPDH that locates in the same fractions as polysome, demonstrating the noncoding potential of NRAV (Figures S1D and S1E). Importantly, both qRT-PCR and northern blotting confirmed that NRAV expression was markedly reduced in IAV-infected A549 cells ( Figures 1C and 1D ). Northern blot analysis using a specific probe (793 nt) demonstrated that the major form of human NRAV was the transcript of approximately 1,200 nt ( Figure 1D ). Consistently, determination of 5 0 and 3 0 ends of NRAV by RACE studies revealed that NRAV transcript is exactly 1,176 nt and contains a polyadenylated (12 As) tail (Figures 1E and S1F ; Table S1 ).",

Surprisingly, NRAV was also significantly downregulated by infections of several other viruses, including a negative ssRNA virus Sendai virus (SeV), a dsRNA virus Muscovy Duck Reovirus (MDRV), and a DNA virus herpes simplex virus (HSV) (Figures 1H and 1I) . In contrast, NRAV levels were not affected by pseudovirus transduction, LPS treatment, etoposide stimulation, or serum withdrawal (Figures S1G-S1J).

            "text": "To further determine the functionality of NRAV in IAV infection, we generated A549 and 293T cell lines stably expressing whole length of the human NRAV or specific shRNAs targeting NRAV using the retroviral vectors or shRNA-based lentivectors (Figures 2A, S2A, and S2B) . Although IAV infection reduced the endogenous NRAV expression, it had no significant effects on the ectopically expressed NRAV and could not diminish the difference of NRAV expression between sh-Luc control cells and NRAV knockdown cells ( Figure 2B ). Strikingly, both the virus growth kinetics measured by haemagglutination assay and the virus titers determined by plaque-forming test showed that forced expression of NRAV significantly promoted the viral replication, while disruption of NRAV expression consistently impaired the virus reproduction in A549 cells ( Figures 2C-2E) . The sh-NRAV-1 cells with lower NRAV expression were used in further studies. Similar results were obtained from NRAV overexpression and knockdown in 293T cells ( Figure S2C ). The increased virus titers in supernatant from NRAV-overexpressing cells were further confirmed by western blotting using an antibody against the IAV hemagglutinin (HA) (Figures S2D and S2E) . Because IAV infection caused a marked decrease in NRAV expression in A549 cells, we determined whether NRAV levels in NRAV-knockdown cells were lower than those in the control cells during IAV infection. Indeed, the knockdown cells showed clearly low levels of NRAV compared with the controls ( Figure 2F ). However, the DYNLL1 levels were not affected by altered expression of NRAV, and therefore NRAV functions unlikely through a cis-effect on DYNLL1 ( Figures S2F and S2G ). These data suggest that lncRNA NRAV is involved in regulating IAV replication, and downregulation of NRAV in infected cells might be a host self-protection response to the virus infection, which may be critical to viral clearance. (A) Microarray analysis revealed 494 upregulated and 413 downregulated lncRNAs in IAV-infected A549 cells compared to control (n = 3; fold change > 2.0; p < 0.05) (left). Cells infected with WSN were collected 12 hr postinfection (hpi). The RNA quantitation is shown as centered and scaled log2 data in heatmaps. The differential expressions of 9 selected lncRNAs were confirmed by RT-PCR (right). NRAV (uc001tyk.1) is indicated by red rectangle. (B) Shown is a paradigm of the genomic location of lncRNA gene nrav (purple) and the relationship with gene dynll1 (light blue). The probe for NRAV used in northern blot (NB) (red bar) and the primers for DYNLL1 (blue bar) are indicated (not scaled). (C and D) The downregulation of NRAV in infected A549 cells was confirmed by qRT-PCR (C) (n = 3; means \u00b1 SEM; *p < 0.05) and northern blot (D). Arrow indicates the abundant form of NRAV. (E) The 5 0 and 3 0 end sequences of NRAV in A549 determined by 5 0 and 3 0 RACE and NCBI sequences of BC065744 and BC053632 are shown. (F) A549 cells were infected with WSN at indicated mois for 12 hr or at an moi of 3 for indicated hours. RT-PCR was performed to determine the NRAV expression. (G) The NRAV expression in indicated human cell lines infected with/without WSN (moi = 3) for 12 hr was examined by RT-PCR. The viral nucleoprotein (NP) was examined by western blotting. (H and I) The NRAV expression was detected in cells infected with Sendai virus (SeV), Muscovy duck reovirus (MDRV), or herpes simplex virus (HSV) by RT-PCR (H) and qRT-PCR (I).

The TG mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were intranasally inoculated with WSN virus, and the influence of NRAV on the virulence and infection kinetics was analyzed. As expected, the IAV showed a considerably higher virulence in TG mice than that in WT mice. Under our experimental condition, body weight loss of infected TG mice was observed on day 4 postinfection (dpi) ( Figure 3B ). By 5-9 dpi, infected TG mice exhibited a consistent decrease in body weight, and with an average loss of approximately 25% on 8 dpi. All infected TG mice died within 9 dpi ( Figure 3C ). Under the same conditions, however, inoculated WT littermates started body weight loss on 5 dpi, with an average loss of approximately 8% on 8 dpi, and only approximately 40% of infected WT mice succumbed within 9 dpi ( Figure 3C ). Approximately 60% infected WT mice gained body weight gradually after 8 dpi and finally survived.",

Remarkably, pathologic examination by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining displayed more severe inflammation in the lungs of infected TG mice than those of the WT controls (Figure 3E ).

The microarray data displayed 882 genes upregulated and 1,538 genes downregulated (over 2-fold change, p < 0.05) in NRAV-overexpressing cells as compared with the controls (Figure 4A , left). Many of the differentially expressed genes were found to be associated with pathogen infection and viral reproduction through pathway analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis ( Figures S3A and S3B ). Surprisingly, we identified 107 ISGs from differentially expressed genes in NRAV-overexpressing cells, and strikingly, the enrichment score of these ISGs was significantly high (21.3) using the analysis with interferome (Rusinova et al., 2013) (Table S2 ). Since ISGs are important antiviral effectors, we focused specifically on the ISG genes for further studies. Importantly, mRNA levels of some critical ISGs were significantly reduced in NRAV-overexpressing cells, including IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM3, OASL, and MxA ( Figure 4A , right). This finding was further confirmed by qRT-PCR ( Figure 4B ). In contrast, the mRNA levels of these ISGs were upregulated in NRAV knockdown cells ( Figure 4C ). Furthermore, the expression of ISGs regulated by NRAV was examined in IAV-infected NRAV TG mice and WT littermates. Consistently, we found that the levels of these ISGs in TG mice were significantly reduced as compared with those in WT controls after infection with IAV ( Figures 4D and  4E ). These results reveal that NRAV functions as a negative regulator of some ISGs during the IAV infection in vitro and in vivo.",

To this end, exogenous IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM3, or MxA was transiently expressed in the cell lines overexpressing NRAV or empty vector (EV) ( Figure S3C ). Indeed, forced expression of IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM3, or MxA reversed the effect of NRAV on the IAV replication despite existence of excessive NRAV, whereas expression of control DDX3X, a component of TBK1dependent innate immune response, had no such a function ( Figures S3D and S3E ). Because previous studies have shown that MxA interacts with IAV protein NP to inhibit the viral transcription (M\u00e4 nz et al., 2013) , we tested whether NRAV knockdown had any effects on IAV cRNA levels. Indeed, we found that the cRNA levels were clearly low in NRAV-depleted cells compared to the control at 8 hpi ( Figure S3F ), suggesting that the increased MxA caused by NRAV downregulation may block IAV transcription. However, altering NRAV expression has no significant effect on viral entry at early stage of viral infection (4 hr) ( Figure S3G ). These results suggest that lncRNA NRAV is critically involved in regulation of innate immune response via controlling the levels of several critical ISGs during the viral infection.",

Thus, we presumed that NRAV might be involved in transcriptional control of these ISGs. The pre-mRNA level can represent the initial transcription rate. Therefore, the primers to examine the pre-mRNA levels of MxA (preMxA) and IFITM3 (preIFITM3) were designed as previously described (Zeisel et al., 2011) ( Figure 6B ). We observed that the preMxA and preIFITM3 levels in infected NRAV-overexpressing cells were lower than those in control (p < 0.05), while no bands were observed in no reverse transcriptase control ( Figures 6C-6E ), indicating that NRAV may regulate the initial transcription of MxA and IFITM3.

We found that the H3K4me3 enrichments at the mxA and ifitm3 transcription start sites in NRAV-overexpressing cells were obviously impaired as compared with those in control cells following IAV infection ( Figures 6F and S5H ). In contrast, the H3K27me3 enrichment at mxA gene locus in infected NRAV-overexpressing cells exhibited remarkably higher than that in control cells, although the H3K27me3 enrichment at ifitm3 remained unchanged ( Figures 6G and S5I ). Consistently, NRAV knockdown resulted in a significant increase in H3K4me3 enrichments and a significant decrease in H3K27me3 enrichments at mxA and ifitm3 transcription start sites ( Figures S5J and S5K ). These data reveal that NRAV may function to inhibit the ISG transcription by affecting the histone modifications of these genes.",

This finding was further confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) showing that the amount of NRAV precipitated with anti-ZONAB Ab was dramatically higher than that of GAPDH control ( Figure S6B ). We next determined the role of ZONAB in MxA expression. The shRNA-based ZONAB knockdown was performed and verified by qRT-PCR ( Figure S6C ). Interestingly, the levels of MxA mRNA were significantly decreased after silencing ZONAB in both infected and uninfected cells ( Figure 6I ). When ZONAB was depleted in NRAV-overexpressing cells, the MxA mRNA was decreased to a lower level ( Figure 6J ), while NRAV was not affected by altered ZONAB expression ( Figure S6D , left). Consistently, the exogenous expression of ZONAB in NRAV-overexpressing cells partially reversed the NRAV-mediated suppression of MxA expression ( Figures   S6D-S6F ). These results indicate that ZONAB is involved in MxA transcription as a positive regulator.",

As displayed, mutant A (mutA) lacks the stem-loop arm A, while contains other stem-loop structures or elements (arms C, D, and E) as compared with the intact NRAV ( Figure 7A ). Ectopic expression of these mutants was determined by RT-PCR ( Figure 7B , right). Interestingly, experiments testing the effects of these mutants on virus replication demonstrated that all examined structure moieties of NRAV except arm D, which was a small arm of NRAV (nt 618-872), were required for its role in controlling IAV replication ( Figure 7C ). Consistently, the reduction of MxA mRNA level was detected only in cells ectopically expressing WT NRAV or its mutD ( Figure 7D ). These experiments demonstrate that RNA sequences of stem loops in NRAV except nt 618-872 may form a spatial structure that is essential for its function.",

Here we report a human lncRNA named as NRAV, which is expressed in various human cells, but significantly downregulated during the IAV infection and infections with ssRNA virus (SeV), dsRNA virus (MDRV), and DNA virus (HSV). Importantly, we have revealed that overexpression of NRAV promotes the IAV replication in vitro and in vivo by suppressing the expression of several key ISGs, such as IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM3, and MxA, very likely through affecting the histone modifications of these ISG genes. These findings establish that NRAV functions as an important regulatory molecule via negatively regulating the expression of some crucial antiviral proteins, which modulates the host innate immune response against IAV infection and maybe more broadly involved in other viral infections.",

Although the mechanism underlying downregulation of NRAV by viral infection remains elusive, the expression of NRAV is likely controlled by particular pathways activated upon sensing the viral infection. Indeed, we found that the NRAV downregulation was induced only by viral RNA which is produced during virus replication (Figures S7A-S7E) and newly synthesized protein(s) ( Figure S7F ). However, these proteins might include neither virus-induced cytokines nor IFNAR1 (Figures S7G-S7J ). We observed that reduction of NRAV was not caused by increase in RNA decay ( Figure S7K ), indicating that this protein(s) might be relevent with the transcriptional regulation of NRAV. CpG islands and some transcription factor binding sites on the upstream of nrav were predicted ( Figure S7L ). Interestingly, DNA methyltransferase might participate in the regulation of NRAV ( Figures S7M-S7P) . These findings suggest that virus infection might induce the transcription inhibition of nrav through epigenetic modification.",

Shown are representative data of three independent experiments. Means \u00b1 SEM; n = 3. *p < 0.05. \u00c0RT, no reverse transcriptase in reverse transcription (RT). RT, normal reaction. The length of RT-PCR product is shown. (F and G) ChIP analysis of H3K4me3 (F) and H3K27me3 (G) levels at the mxA and ifitm3 locus in IAV-infected NRAV-overexpressing or control cells. The relative amounts of mxA and ifitm3 DNA immunoprecipitated by the anti-H3K4me3 or anti-H3K27me3 antibody were normalized to that isolated by the control IgG. The fold enrichment was calculated as 2 \u00c0DDCt (mean \u00b1 SEM; n = 3). (H) Silver staining of proteins pulled down by NRAV antisense probes or scramble control probes from A549 cell lysate. The specific NRAV-associated band (arrow) was excised for mass spectrometry. Shown are representative data from three independent experiments. (I) MxA mRNA levels in ZONAB-depleted A549 cells infected with or without WSN (moi = 1, 12 hpi) were measured by qRT-PCR and normalized to that of uninfected control cells transfected with vector sh-Luc. (J) Experiments were performed as described in (I). MxA mRNA levels in ZONAB-depleted NRAVoverexpressing A549 cells were measured by qRT-PCR. Data are shown as means \u00b1 SEM; n = 3. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. See also Figures S5-S7 and Table S3 . (Lazear et al., 2013) . Interestingly, these NRAV-modulated ISGs have recently been reported belonging to a subset of ISGs which are regulated by an IKKi-associated specific signal pathway (Ng et al., 2011; Tenoever et al., 2007) . In this study, we found that the initial transcription rates of MxA and IFITM3 were reduced and the histone modifications (active mark H3K4me3 and repressive mark H3K27me3) were altered by NRAV. Several lncRNAs have been reported to regulate chromatin remodeling on specific gene location through directly binding with hnRNPs (Carpenter et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014) . Although we have excluded the possibility that NRAV functions through regulating IFN-JAK/STAT1 pathway, the molecular mechanism by which NRAV regulates the initial transcription and histone modifications remains unknown. On the other hand, NRAV was shown to interfere with the MxA and IFITM3 promoter activity in a luciferase reporter system. These data suggest that there might exist multiple mechanisms underlying NRAV-mediated regulation of ISG transcription.",

            "text": "It has been thought that lncRNAs usually interact with other molecules to exert regulatory activities. In this study, ZONAB was identified as a NRAV-associated protein involved in MxA transcription regulation. ZONAB is a multifunctional protein that regulates transcription of cyclin D1 and PCNA as an important transcription factor and posttranscriptionally regulates other protein and mRNA levels in cytoplasm (Lima et al., 2010; Nie et al., 2012) . Although it is unclear whether ZONAB functions as a transcription factor of ISG expression, we found a ZONAB binding sequence (invert CCAAT) at \u00c0219 to -215 of MxA transcription start region (Dolfini and Mantovani, 2013) , suggesting the potential involvement of ZONAB in initial transcription of MxA. Additionally, as a transcription factor ZONAB might also be involved in histone modifications and nucleosome packing (Rothenberg, 2014) . It has been thought that ZONAB can upregulate several chromatin remodeling components (histone H4 and HMG-I) and MYC that recruits core histone-modifying enzymes to DNA (Sourisseau et al., 2006) . Further experiments are needed in the future to address how ZONAB interacts with NRAV to regulate ISG expression.",

Although Dynein is shown to be recruited by many viruses to facilitate their replication and enhance their spread, and direct interaction of Dynll with virions is identified (Merino-Gracia et al., 2011), we did not observe significant change in the Dynll1 levels after altering the NRAV expression (GEO accession number GSE48874; Figures S2F and S2G) . Of interest is that hundreds of genes differentially expressed in NRAV-overexpressing cells and the pathway and GO analysis indicated that many are associated with pathogen infection and viral reproduction. In addition, the expression of NRAV in different types of human cells also indicates its broad functions. The expression of human NRAV in multiple tissues of TG mice including lung, thymus, and bone marrow might be important for the IAV pathogenesis. Therefore, the role of NRAV may be not limited to the modulation of ISGs. Moreover, the decline of NRAV level can also be induced by other RNA/DNA virus infections. Hence, we surmise that NRAV-related cellular response may be a universal defense against virus infection. The exact relationship between NRAV distribution in different tissues and its antiviral activities needs to be determined.",

The stable NRAV-overexpressing cells lines were constructed with a retroviral expression system as described previously (Qiu et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013) .The expression construct is modified by inserting a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation (BGH-po lyA) sequence from pcDNA3.1 into XhoI-EcoRI sites before the GFP coding sequence in the vector. The stable knockdown cells of NRAV were generated using a shRNA- ",

The NRAV expression was determined by RT-PCR of mouse tissue after eut hanasia. Transgenic lines with high expression were maintained and used in this study. The C57B L/6 wild-type (WT) and NRAV-expressing TG mice (5-6 weeks of age, 5-13 mice/group) were inoculated intranasally with or without 10 3 PFU (about 0.5\u00d7LD 50 for WT mice) of WSN diluted in 50 \u00b5L of sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Mice were weighted daily to monitor signs of illness for a period of 14 days.Mouse lungs (13 mice/group) were collected on 6 dpi and used for further examination. Lung viral loads were measured by standard plaque forming assay, and mouse ISGs mRNA levels in lung were quantified by real-time RT-PCR and RT-PCR.Haematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining of mouse lung was performed as previously described (Wang et al., 2014) .",
