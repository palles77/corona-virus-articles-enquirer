For microbiologists, as the organism in question was the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae, this milestone opened up the potential to address fundamental questions about bacterial pathogenesis. Since then, major advances in sequencing platforms, particularly the introduction of next-generation technologies, have resulted in a significant reduction in the cost of sequencing a bacterial genome (currently less than UK\u00a350 per genome for Staphylococcus aureus (J. Parkhill, personal communication)), and some platforms now have a turnaround time of a day or less, but the ability to use the genome sequence alone to predict the potential for a bacterium to cause severe disease remains elusive.",

Importantly, this interplay depends on how and when these bacterial factors are expressed. Defining the role of host immunity in disease outcome is crucial if tools to predict disease severity are to be built, but equally, we must be able to predict the virulence potential of a bacterial strain from its genome sequence. Although sequencing can list which virulence factorencoding genes are present in a genome, without an understanding of the regulatory and epistatic processes that control their expression, the contribution of this list of genes to virulence cannot be quantified. With a more comprehensive understanding of the combinations of genetic backgrounds, regulatory networks and virulence factors that produce virulent strains, researchers might be better able to rapidly predict the propensity of a particular strain to cause severe and transmissible disease. In this Opinion article, we outline how a systems biology approach might just be the tool to help, using the important human pathogen S. aureus as a model.",

For the purposes of this article, systems biology is defined as an interdisciplinary approach that focuses on interactions in biological systems 2 . A typical systems biology approach is to describe the components of a biological system and how they interrelate by means of a mathematical model, which is then validated through iterative cycles of construction and then testing with experimental data from diverse sources, including the omics fields (such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) and studies in classical genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology and structural biology. If the model holds up to scrutiny, then it can be applied to real-world situations to understand the emergent properties. The model can then also be used to predict how additional or external factors that affect individual components or groups of components within the system will affect the activity of particular parts of the system or of the system as a whole 3 .",

In addition, to reduce complexity, assumptions must be made about the characteristics of the factors in the model, and this is again an uncomfortable concept for many molecular biologists, who are more used to building hypotheses on the basis of empirical data rather than assumptions. Systems biology is not an immediate or direct answer to the big questions faced by biologists, but rather an integrative and iterative approach that describes a biological system and then allows the gradual introduction of increasing amounts of complexity until the model reflects the system in the natural state. It is then that we can address the big questions, such as whether bacterial virulence can be predicted from genome sequence data.",

Such studies have greatly expanded our purview of virulence, generating vast amounts of data, but have also demonstrated that the presence or absence of individual virulence genes is not sufficient to predict the overall, or net, virulence of a strain. Examples of disease-specific toxins, such as toxic shock syndrome toxin of S. aureus, might seem exceptions to this rule, as genes encoding these toxins are always present in strains causing this type of infection. However, the presence of such a gene in itself is not indicative of disease outcome, as the same gene is found readily in asymptomatically carried strains. The effect of small genetic changes (for example, SNPs) in effector genes or in their regulators -changes that would be undetectable by PCR or microarray screens -must also be determined. Crucially, the role of epistasis (that is, the effect that mutations in one part of the genome have on the activity of genes elsewhere) must be considered. The effect of epistasis is well established for antibiotic resistance mechanisms 7-10 , but as a term it is less commonly associated with the expression of virulence genes in bacteria. However, the very existence of genes encoding global regulators of virulence genes demonstrates that epistasis is likely to have a significant effect on the net virulence of a strain.",

            "text": "To account for epistasis, any systems biology model of virulence must incorporate not only the virulence genes but also the regulators controlling their expression. Unfortunately, it is difficult to assemble gene-regulatory networks from omics data sets with a high level of accuracy because biological systems are often underdetermined. There is a growing number of studies that have constructed transcriptionregulatory networks in microorganisms [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , but even with large-scale omics data sets, there are usually more possible ways for genes to regulate one another than there are molecules with which to achieve such regulation. As a consequence, mathematical models can only characterize regulatory networks from omics data sets by making limiting assumptions (for example, that co-regulated genes must have similar functions). In addition, these studies typically involve one strain and/or one technique (for example, transcriptomics or proteomics), which also limits the ability of the model to be a general predictor of gene regulation. A good example of a study that begins to address some of these limitations is that of Yoon et al. 23 , who used both transcriptomic and proteomic data to identify novel proteins secreted by the single serovar S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium through the type III secretion system, and then used standard cellular and molecular biology approaches to verify the activity of these proteins. A good systems biology approach exploits multidisciplinary expertise and techniques to identify the minimum set of biological information needed to explain or define a system.",

            "text": "The virulence of S. aureus is well defined and is conferred by the activity of many effector molecules that interact directly with the host. These effectors can be grouped into three categories: adhesins 28 , which facilitate adherence to host tissues; toxins 24, 26 , which cause specific tissue damage to the host; and evasins 29, 30 , which interfere with host immune function. The phenotypes conferred by these factors are determined by the level of expression of the genes encoding them, which is in turn controlled by the activity of the virulence regulatory network. Virulence regulators can be either proteins 31 or regulatory RNA molecules 32 . As more genetically diverse S. aureus strains are being studied, it is becoming increasingly clear that the regulatory networks are not uniform, and this illustrates the importance of understanding the epistatic interactions that occur between virulence regulators and virulence genes. For example, in many HA-MRSA strains, agr (the major regulatory system responsible for the density-dependent switch from the adhesive to the toxic phenotype) is inactive, making these strains more adhesive than toxic 33, 34 . There are many other examples of genes encoding dysfunctional regulators in particular strains (such as sigB (encoding RNA polymerase \u03c3-factor \u03c3 B ) 35 , saeRS 36 , sarT 37 and sarU 37 ), suggesting that the activity of each member of the regulatory network is likely to be a key factor in the virulence phenotype of an individual S. aureus strain.",

            "text": "S. aureus, but also the known effects of these regulators on the activity of other regulators in the network. A preliminary model of this regulatory network can be built using standard techniques. For example, by applying the network identification by multiple regression (NIR) 44 method, the functional relationships of all known regulators are first expressed by a system of linear (or nonlinear) differential equations 44, 45 , each describing the change in expression level of each regulator in response to individual perturbations (mutations). The system, or the underlying regulatory network, can then be inferred through multiple linear regression, or other iterative methods (such as MCMC 19 ) that minimize the deviation between model prediction and experimentally determined expression levels. However, the regulatory network depicted in FIG. 1 is currently limited by the fact that much of the available data have been generated in different laboratories, using different media and different S. aureus strains, at different time points of growth and using different methods (including northern blots, reporter fusions and quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR). It is therefore difficult to compare these data directly. The network in FIG. 1 is also skewed towards certain regulators, according to their perceived importance and how recently they have been characterized. The data set is also incomplete; the lack of a connecting line between two regulators implies not that there is no interaction between these regulators but rather that these experiments have yet to be carried out. Therefore, the picture of how the regulators interact with each other remains incomplete, and the combinations of regulators that determine the virulence phenotype of each strain have not yet been determined. The network also does not include newly identified regulatory RNA molecules or account for the effects of posttranslational modification. Nevertheless, it serves as an illustration of how a robust definition of such a system can be used as a starting point to which additional details and features can be added when their role in virulence is established.",

Bioinformatic analysis of the gene sequences of these 20 regulators (FIG. 1) (FIG. 2) . The most variable gene is agrD, which shows only 57% identity between strains N315 and MRSA252. At the other extreme, only sarA and sarR are 100% identical across all ten strains, suggesting that they are under extreme stabilizing selection. For all the other regulatory genes tested, the sequence identity is high across the ten strains (FIG. 2) . SarS serves as a good illustration of how two nucleotide changes in the gene can significantly affect protein activity and how structural information can greatly inform this approach (detailed in BOX 2) . Other approaches, such as network component analysis and regulatory linkage analysis [54] [55] [56] , can be applied to characterize potential changes in protein activity as a result of SNPs in genes encoding transciption factors, as has been done previously in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 56 . These potential changes can be further verified by molecular techniques (such as expression of protein variants in null backgrounds followed by an assessment of protein activity) and fed into the mathematical description (that is, the model) of the regulatory network.",

The quality of the sequencing and the clinical data associated with each strain will be crucial if we are to make robust genome-wide associations between genome, virulence and disease outcome. But as genome sequencing is becoming faster and cheaper, such studies should become more common, providing a wealth of sequence data from which the variability in the virulence-regulatory network can be determined and indexed.

Importantly, however, robust validation of the resulting systems biology-based models is crucial. Although an initial model can be constructed using data from a set of 'starter' strains, this model must be validated using iterative cycles of data and data from an independent set of 'tester' strains. To do this, the regulatory index of a strain must be determined from the genome sequence. The predicted virulence index can then be compared to the actual virulence index, as measured empirically using the same assays that were used to define the index of the starter strains (for example, toxicity, adhesion and evasion). In addition to testing the predictive power of the model, this step will also help identify previously uncharacterized factors. If the predictive power is found to be poor (for example, only accurate for 50% of the tester strains), the genome sequences of the strains that do not fit the model should be analysed to identify any common factors that may explain this deviance. These factors could include the presence or absence of regu latory genes or small RNA molecules that are not currently considered in the model; the presence of specific SNPs in regulatory loci; the presence or absence of dominant effector molecules (for example, phenol-soluble modulin (PSM)-mec 61 , a small secreted cytolytic molecule that is encoded by the psm-mec locus and is believed to contribute to the virulence of CA-MRSA); or the presence of small encoded peptides that can be missed with current bioinformatic algorithms. When such common factors are identified, the effect of these factors on the regulatory network and on the virulence index can be determined empirically (that is, the gene can be mutated and the change in phenotype assayed) and then incorporated into the model. The refined model will then need to be verified with another independent set of 'tester' strains, followed by testing on new strains until the predictive power of the model is at a satisfactory level. The difference in the predictive success of the model for the first set of strains and for the final set can be used as a benchmark of progress.",

We predict that such substitutions will hinder the ability of SarS to recruit RNA polymerase to the promoter region because they have replaced negatively charged residues with polar residues, which will affect the electrostatic interactions between SarS and the positively charged RNA polymerase subunits.

Several recent reviews have described the application of systems biology methods that, in the absence of epistasis, should be sufficient to map gene sequence to virulence 63, 64 . We believe that these models could be improved by incorporating an understanding of how the genes interact with each other. Recent evidence suggests that problems such as functional redundancy, as well as problems caused by diverse combinations of genes resulting in similar phenotypes, apply to many bacterial pathogens of humans, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis 7 , S. enterica 8 , Escherichia coli 9 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10 . We propose that these problems can be overcome by applying systems biology methods to many isolates, carefully validating these methods for the relevant species, and then using the resulting models to identify and predict the gene combinations that lead to specific virulence phenotypes and to predict the traits of a strain from its genome sequence alone. Although this type of project is likely to be challenging and will require the efforts of teams of scientists, the framework we outline here should prove useful for any microbial pathogen. Similar programmes of work are already underway, such as the Systems Biology Program for Infectious Disease Research 3 (funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, US National Institutes for Health), which is focusing on M. tuberculosis, influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp., with the aim of shifting the paradigm of host-pathogen research and developing new ways to control these human pathogens 3 .",

            "text": "In the 17 years since the first bacterial genome was sequenced 1 and the 12 years since systems biology was first launched as an experimental approach 65 , vast amounts of data have been generated that have provided a deeper insight into some biological systems. However, we do not yet have the ability to predict the virulence of a bacterial strain from its genome sequence. This limitation has many other contributory factors beyond those addressed in this article. Host susceptibility is a key factor in precipitating disease. Other factors such as intra-and inter species competition during colonization and infection can also affect disease severity [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] . Nevertheless, despite the plethora of complicating factors, we believe that the approach outlined here provides a first step towards linking bacterial virulence to gene sequence using existing technologies. As it is rapidly becoming as cost effective to sequence the genome of an infecting strain as it is to send the strain to a routine diagnostics laboratory for identification and antibiotic resistance profiling, we need to find ways to interpret and make use of the sequence data obtained. Although sceptics might argue that the potential for systems biology to be used to predict virulence will not be reached for decades, in this Opinion article we have illustrated how this might be achieved for S. aureus using existing data and technology, and we believe that these tools can be built within the next 5-10 years. The framework presented here can be applied to any microorganism, but it will require multidisciplinary teams using large and diverse data sets and appropriate model validation. We think that the considered application of systems biology to understanding and predicting virulence could potentially revolutionize the way that existing and emerging global pathogens are investigated and controlled.",
