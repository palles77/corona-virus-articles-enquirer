Mouse models are also complicated by our limited understanding of the phenotypes of human diseases 14, 15 . Designing perfect models of diseases that we do not fully understand is a tall order, and chronic diseases that involve life-long interactions between the host and the environment present a particularly difficult challenge [5] [6] [7] [8] . Developing truly chronic models of disease is, however, heavily militated against owing to ethical concerns about prolonged suffering. Moreover, the typically short-term nature of research funding, where outputs must be deliverable at a reasonable cost and within the time frame of a project grant, hinders the development of chronic models of disease.",

Without effective public input, we run the risk that research priorities become the whim of changing government focuses, which lack the stable, long-term input necessary for meaningful scientific advancement. Although charities and private foundations that are centred on specific diseases provide important contributions, their focus is often too narrow to tackle the wider research agenda. This has led to a culture of increasing financial pressures that are governed by short-term policies, which require rapid outputs, and piecemeal funding, stifling longer term, more open-ended research that might produce real translational progress 10 . For example, political pressures to study agents of bioterrorism or emerging infectious diseases such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) can be welcomed and are clearly important; however, more long-term commitment to studying infections of historical global importance is also essential.",

We have proposed that the immunity seen in pathology rarely falls clearly into categories of innate and adaptive immune, or T helper 1 (T H 1) and T H 2 responses. Rather, pathology is generated by a networked interaction that changes over time. The networked relationships of immune pathology might be better described as 'contiguous immunity', in which multiple processes or networks can be operational and in dialogue in the same space (physically contiguous); equally, processes might be linked together in evolving patterns (temporally contiguous). Understanding these networks, and, where necessary, developing new models to elucidate and target them, is essential to effective translational biology. IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin. public access. Good clinical practice not only should focus on ensuring that existing best practice is reliably reproduced, but also should put equal weight to research and development of practice through translational research. It is not just the priority of scientists to engage with clinicians: the imperative is equally strong that clinicians should engage more with basic scientists. In both cases it is important that such engagement is facilitated and supported by national policy.",

As we learn to integrate complex data sets with in vitro cell biology and in vivo models, we might begin to generate virtual phenotypes, allowing conclusions to be drawn on the basis of the relatedness of a series of data sets to the questions asked. In essence, all researchers do this when they read published data, but the process is inherently subjective and formalizing such integrated biology could be more objective and so better inform future experiments.",

Award programme in the United States provides an excellent example of how this might be accomplished. Experienced researchers who have superior competing renewal scores (scoring between the 0.1 and 5th percentiles), and who have shown a long-term commitment to and success in research may be selected for financial support for up to 10 years.Therefore, MERIT Award recipients have a much longer window of opportunity to move studies along from basic to translational research while being provided with the necessary freedom from the administrative burdens associated with more frequent grant submissions. Unfortunately, these awards are extremely limited in number and do not apply to the majority of outstanding NIH grantees. Examples of what can be accomplished by long-term funding include the substantial contribution to the development and subsequent humanization of monoclonal antibodies at the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory for Molecular Biology in Cambridge.",
