The stools are usually watery and without blood, containing fecal leukocytes in 16 to 31 per cent of cases and mucus in up to 50 per cent of infections. 60 , 112 Rotavirus infection is often associated with white stools in Japan, 14 The white cell count is usually between 7000 to 12,000 per cu mm. 60 , 112 Elevation of serum glutamic axalic transaminase has been reported. m The disease is usually self-limited, but symptomatic relapses can occur. 2fJ 132 Rotavirus disease in adults is less' likely to occur than in children, and when it does it is less likely to be symptomatic. In a prospective study of 98 families, Wenman found an attack rate in children of 32 per cent per year and in adults of 17 per cent per year. Of those who were infected, 70 per cent of children and 40 per cent of adults developed symptoms. 14H Adults have developed symptomatic infection as a result of secondary spread fi:om infected children, as a result of primary infection, and as a type of traveler's diarrhea. Adults can experience loose stools, malaise, abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. In two studies of traveler' s diarrhea, rotavirus was responsible for one third of the cases in both Peace Corps volunteers traveling to Honduras and in Panamanians traveling to Mexico. 122 , 144 Rotavirus infection in the newborn infant is less common than in the six month to two year old group and is often manifested by asymptomatic excretion of virus. Excretion of rotavirus by newborn inhmts has been found in up to one-half of babies surveyed. Of newborn infants who excrete rotavirus, only 8 to 24 per cent have diarrhea or vomiting. lO, 20, B!l In one study the most important factor responsible for the occurrence of diarrhea in rotavirus in-fection was proximity to other newborn infants and frequency of handling by adults. lO Although breast-feeding is not always protective, many investigators have reported significantly less frequent rotavirus infection in babies who were breast-fed (22 per cent) cornpared with babies who were bottlefed (58 per cent).lO, 87 Bottle-fed babies who were rotavirus positive excreted greater amounts of rotavirus than breast-fed babies. 20 Others have found an inverse correlation between the level of secretory IgA in colostrum of mothers and rotavirus infection in breast-fed infants. 88 Analysis of rotavirus RNA patterns has documented two principal varieties of rotavirus isolated from infants that are distinct from those isolated from young children, implying that there may be a difference in the virus as well as in host factors involved in neonatal infection compared with that in young children. 1ll There are at least two functional serotypes of human rotavirus as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These two serotypes have shown a shift in their prevalence over the years. In Washington, D.e., the prevalence of Type 2 rotavirus in 1973 to 1977 was 100 per cent, whereas in 1977 to 1978 it was only 57 per cent. In addition, Type 2 may cause more severe disease than Type 1. Where recurrent rotavirus infection has been evaluated, it appears that reinfection occurs with a different serotype of rotavirus. 163 By using serum neutralization techniques, four and possibly five serotypes have been defined. However, because of extensive cross-reactivity it has been difficult to determine the exact number of serotypes.7",

However, no neonate who received breast milk with an antirotavirus secretory IgA of 280 J,Lg per ml or more became infected, suggesting a role for specific IgA in protection of the neonate from rotavirus infection. RH However, in another study the presence of IgA antibody in breast milk did not correlate with protection from rotavirus infection. 140 Further information suggesting a role for partial protection of neonates by colostral and milk antibodies comes from animal studies. One calf fed colostrum with a neutralizing antibody titer of 1:320 to bovine rotavirus 4 and 24 hours after birth was protected from disease when inoculated with rotavirus at 12 hours after birthY Gnotobiotic lambs fed 450 ml (but not those fed only 100 ml) of colostrum on the first or second day of life and challenged two days later with rotavirus were protected from disease. 126 Also protected from disease were lambs fed 40 ml per kg of colostrum for four consecutive days after birth and challenged with rotavirus on the second day.125 In addition, two infant lambs fed high titer antirotavirus hyperimmune serum on days two to four did not excrete rotavirns or develop diarrhea when challenged on day two with rotavirus. 126 Thus, oral ingestion of substantial amounts of antibody directed against rotavirus seems to be protective in lambs and cows.",

The particles have a central dense core (33 nm in diameter) surrounded by a moderately dense capsid zone about 67 to 70 nm in diameter. About 10 per cent of particles within vesicles are enveloped (87 to 90 nm in diameter). Some enveloped particles appear to acquire an envelope from the endoplasmic reticulum. Areas of \"viroplasm\" or \"virus factories\" may be found in the cytoplasm, not membrane bound, containing moderately electron-dense, granular, or finely fibrillar material. Microvilli of infected cells are often irregular and distorted. Degenerating cells appearing to discharge virus into the lumen have been observed. 8 In addition to the above findings, rotavirus infection in some animals is associated with nuclear and cytoplasmic tubular inclusions. 6 The gastric and colonic lTIUCOSae have been reported to be normal in the few rotavirus-infected infants in which they have been exalTIined. 92 Depression of disaccharidase (maltase, sucrase, or lactase) levels was found in 14 out of 16 children.

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration in isolated jejunal villus enterocytes did not differ significantly in control and infected animals. Davidson concludes that the diarrhea in the rotavirusinfected animals was caused by repopulation of the damaged mucosa with immature cells that cannot absorb as well as n1ature cells. 27 Lactase has been postulated to serve as the intestinal receptor and uncoater of rotavirus because decreases in lactase activity correlate with decreased susceptibility of animals to rotavirus infection. 63 Furthermore, lactase partially uncoats bovine rotavirus in vitro. Recent data in mice, however, suggest that lactase is not the receptor.1.52",

Vaccination of adult ewes and cows with inactivated rotavirus results in a marked increase in colostral antibody. us, 147 Calves of vaccinated cows, when challenged with rota virus on day seven had lengthening of the incubation period but diarrhea of equal severity when compared with calves of unvaccinated cows. The experience in animal vaccines will be helpful in developing a human vaccine. Based on experience with animals, the oral, attenuated vaccine is the most promising at this time.",

Rotaviruses have been found in almost every species examined.1, 8, 16, 43, 79, 84, 89, 124, 142 Although cross-species infection is not common, it does oc-CUr. 61 , 90, 93,143, 156 The first transmission of rotaviral disease to another species was accomplished by Light and Hodes in 1943 when calves inoculated with diarrheal stools from children with acute gastroenteritis developed diarrhea. When examined recently by electron microscopy, the calf stool was shown to contain rotaviruses. 61 Human rotavirus has successfully caused symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in gnotobiotic calves,61, 90 lambs, 143 piglets, 93, 143 and monkeys.156 Biophysical Characteristics Rotaviruses are particles with a diameter of 65 to 75 nnl when examined by negative staining under the transmission electron microscope. 42 ,67, 92 They are members of the Reoviridae family.26, 108 Rotaviruses were named for their wheel-like (rota = wheel in Latin) appearance. In early reports they were also called orbiviruses,92 reovirus-like agent (HRVL),42, 67 infantile gastroenteritis viruses,62 or duoviruses. 26 Rotaviruses consist of a dense core of 33 to 40 nm surrounded by a\u00b7 rough-appearing inner capsid and a smooth outer capsid. 35 , 41, 62, 102 The rough particle, which lacks the outer capsid, is 60 to 65 nm in diameter 9 , 35, 41, 42, 62, 92, 102 and is probably not infectious. 1.5, 34 The smooth particle with a diameter of 70 to 75 nm 8 ,9, 35, 41, 42, 62, 92,102 represents the complete virus and is thought to be the infectious form of the virus. lS ,34 In natural infection rough particles, smooth particles, enlpty capsids, and tubular forms are found in the fecesY",
