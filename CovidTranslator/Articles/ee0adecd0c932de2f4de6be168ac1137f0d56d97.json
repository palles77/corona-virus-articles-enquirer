Increases in serum ~/-glutamyltranspeptidase and alkaline phosphatase usually occur when a sufficiently large amount of the duct system is affected. The ducts undergo progressive cylindric dilation, which may be extreme. The smallest interlobular ducts and the cholangioles proliferate. There is inflammation in the walls of the ducts and the portal triads, and this is probably due in part to chemical irritation by bile acids but is largely due to secondary bacterial infections.These infections may be acute and purulent, or low-grade; in these cases, bacteria may not be easily cultured.

            "text": "At low magnification, the histologic changes in the liver are quite reminiscent of the zonal necrosis of acute hepatotoxicities. There is an as yet unexplained susceptibility of the periacinar parenchyma to necrosis in this disease. Close to the portal triads, the hepatocytes may be near normal in appearance, except for loss ofbasophilia and the presence of a scattering of inclusion bodies. In spontaneously fatal cases, most of the parenchyma of the peripheral and central portions of the acini is dead, the hepatocytes having undergone granular acidophilic coagulative necrosis, and in some of these, ghosts of inclusion bodies may be detectable.The margin between necrotic parenchyma and viable tissue is usually quite sharp, although in the viable tissue there are many individual hepatocytes undergoing apoptosis, most of them without inclusion bodies. Fatty changes are common but not constant. The dead cells do not remain long, so the sinusoids become dilated and filled with blood. The reticulin framework remains intact, an observation in keeping with the fact that, in recovered cases, restitution of the liver is complete. Massive necrosis with collapse does not occur. As is typical of severe periacinar necrosis, the necrotic zones, initially eccentric areas about hepatic venules, extend and link up to isolate portal units. Intranuclear inclusions can be found in Kupffer cells in variable numbers. Many of the Kupffer cells are dead, others are proliferating, and others are actively phagocytic in the removal of debris. Leukocytic reactions in the liver are mild and are directed against the necrotic tissue; mononuclear cells are present, but neutrophils, many degenerating, predominate.There is some collection of bile pigment, but it is moderate, in keeping with the short course of the disease. Microscopic lesions in other organs are largely due to injury to endothelium. Inclusion bodies in endothelial cells can be difficult to find and are looked for with most profit in renal glomeruli, where endothelium is concentrated. Occasionally, they are found in the epithelium of collecting tubules.When areas of hemorrhagic consolidation of the lungs are present, there is hemorrhage, edema, and fibrin formation in the alveoli, and in these consolidated areas, inclusions are often common in alveolar capillaries and even in dying cells of the bronchial epithelium. Changes in the brain are essentially secondary to vascular injury and may be absent. Hemorrhages, if present, are from capillaries and small venules, and inclusions in endothelial nuclei can usually be found in vessels that have bled. Other endothelial and adventitial cells are hyperplastic and mixed with a few lymphocytes. Small loci of softening or demyelination may be present in relation to the hemorrhages.",

            "text": "The detailed pathogenesis of infectious canine hepatitis has yet to be worked out. Many infections appear to be clinically silent, and other dogs recover after mild febrile disease with tonsillitis. The fulminating pattern of clinical disease and convalescent phenomena needs further examination. Some sudden deaths in this disease are associated with midbrain hemorrhage, and others occur with, at most, slight structural evidence of liver injury. Following oral exposure, which is probably the natural route of infection, viral multiplication occurs in the tonsils and leads to tonsillitis.The tonsillitis is sometimes quite severe and may be fatal with extensive clear edema of the throat and larynx. Fever accompanies the tonsillitis and apparently precedes the viremic phase, which is of short duration and accompanied by severe leukopenia. Hepatic necrosis develops at about day 7 of experimental infection. The sequence of developments in the liver is not clear, but it is possible that viral proliferation occurs first in Kupffer cells. In surviving animals, hepatic regeneration occurs rapidly, and there do not appear to be any significant residual lesions. Small loci of hepatocellular necrosis involving one to several liver cells may still be present at 2 weeks, and loci of proliferated Kupffer cells may be detectable for another week or two, but progressive hepatic injury does not occur in the natural disease. Progressive hepatic injury does not seem to follow the acute phase of the natural disease, despite the fact that adenoviral antigen may be demonstrated immunohistochemically in Kupffer cells in dogs with various forms of chronic hepatitis, and chronic hepatitis has been produced by experimental adenoviral infection in dogs after certain immunological manipulations. This is consistent with failure to demonstrate virus in the liver after about day 10 of experimental infection. A review of 45 dogs with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis failed to reveal CAdV-1 by either polymerase chain reaction or immunohistochemistry, although the possibility that the virus initiates hepatic damage by provoking selfperpetuating hepatitis could not be excluded. Focal interstitial nephritis occurs commonly, and the cellular infiltrates are persistent but not functionally significant. They consist of interstitial lymphocytic accumulations, especially about the corticomedullary junction and in the loose stroma of the pelvis.",

The lesions in lambs dying within 12 hours of birth consist mainly of widespread petechiae and gastrointestinal hemorrhage; longer survival allows jaundice to develop, and the liver becomes orangeyellow, enlarged, friable, and patchily congested.The bile in the gallbladder becomes thick and dark in some cases, but this may be due more to hemorrhage into the gallbladder than to hemolysis.

It is also understandable that Rift Valley fever and Wesselsbron disease may have been mistaken for one another, but these two diseases may be distinguished by careful pathologic examination as well as by immunodetection or isolation of the viruses. In summary, Rift Valley fever is characterized by obvious focal hepatic necrosis, on which is superimposed an almost massive periacinar and midzonal necrosis; cholestasis is not as prominent as it is in Wesselsbron disease. The liver lesions in the latter disease consist of smaller, randomly distributed foci of hepatocellular necrosis, more active reaction by the sinusoidal lining cells, and more obvious cholestasis.",

The most characteristic histologic feature of affected livers is the presence of shrunken, acidophilic hepatocytes that are concentrated initially in the limiting plates adjacent to the portal triads. There is little or no inflammation associated with affected cells, but portal triads eventually become linked by fibrous trabeculae. Experimentally infected dogs usually remain clinically normal, but regular serum sampling reveals intermittent elevations in alanine aminotransferase levels.The characteristic acidophilic hepatocytes tend not to be so obvious in some experimentally transmitted cases, which raises the possibility that this virus may be involved in otherwise unexplained cases of chronic canine liver disease.",

Those parasites that have the biliary system as their final habitat will be discussed in detail below. The others produce hepatic lesions in the course of their natural or accidental migrations, and are discussed under the organ (for most of them, the gut) that is their final habitat. It is useful however to describe briefly here the lesions produced by larvae in transit. The initial lesion produced by wandering larvae is traumatic. Sinuous tunnels permeate the parenchyma and often breach the capsule. In the tunnels there are free red cells, degenerating hepatocytes, and leukocytes, chiefly eosinophils, which react to the parasites. Bordering the tunnel is a narrow zone of coagulative necrosis of parenchyma with infiltrated neutrophils at its margin. Eosinophils also infiltrate the portal triads. The necrotic parasitic tracts heal by scarification, and the fibroblastic tissue, infiltrated with eosinophils, is eventually incorporated into the portal units (interstitial hepatitis). Most larvae escape from the liver but some eventually become encapsulated in the liver in abscesses containing numerous eosinophils.The abscesses may caseate and come to resemble tubercles, and eventually many are heavily mineralized to form permanent pearly nodules. In sheep, the most common cause of this type of hepatitis (aside from liver fluke) is Cysticercus tenuicollis in its wandering phase. Lambs may die of severe hemorrhagic hepatitis (Fig. 2.62 ) caused by very hea W infections of this parasite, and in pigs, an aberrant host, C. tenuicollis, can produce a very intense inflammatory reaction. In pigs, larvae ofAscaris suum and Stephanurus dentatus produce similar but distinct patterns of focal interstitial hepatitis.The ascarids produce their distinctive accentuation of the stroma (\"milk spots\") ( Fig. 2.63 ) when quite small larvae are immobilized by the host's inflammatory reaction; thus the foci are relatively small.The fibrotic lesion produced by S. dentatus larvae, on the other hand, is less focal and more in the nature of a track, and there are usually small, inflamed, capsular craters where the larvae have emerged from the liver to migrate to their preferred perirenal site.There will be obvious portal phlebitis at the hepatic hilus when infection by S. dentatus has been by the oral route, and in these livers the parenchymal lesion is more severe in this vicinity.",

Toxic hepatic injury depends on the balance between production of reactive metabolites and their detoxification by conjugation and other protective reactions. The cytochrome P450s can be found in all parts of the hepatic acinus, but the hepatocytes of zone 3 have a higher content than those of zone 1, which apparently accounts for the zone 3 predominance of injury produced by compounds metabolized by this system, including carbon tetrachloride and acetaminophen.

Active metabolites of acetaminophen and various other agents are detoxifled by conjugation with glutathione, and depletion of glutathione reserves plays a critical role in the development of toxicity. Hepatic glutathione is also important in the removal of flee radicals and reactive oxygen species through the action of glutathione peroxidase. Efforts to elucidate mechanisms for hepatic injury are complicated by the presence of multiple alternative pathways for metabolism of compounds, the presence of many different isoforms of various enzyme families, particularly the cytochromes P450, and the increasing numbers of genetic polymorphisms identified within individual alleles coding for these isoforms. Many genes for cytochromes P450 and various phase II conjugation enzymes have regulatory sequences that include various transcriptional response elements that respond to nuclear receptors.These receptors resemble steroid receptors and include the arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, the constitutive androstane receptor, and the pregnane X receptor.
