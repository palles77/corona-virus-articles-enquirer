However, at 33\", 2 out of 21 recom-binants selected formed only microplaques. It is shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1 that these  recombinants carry the neuraminidase (NA) of the N2 serotype (S and Ho) and the hemagglutinin (HA) of FPV. These recombinants also have, in addition to the NA genes, RNA segment 1 derived from the Hong Kong or Singapore strains, respectively. Unfortunately, there is no recombinant available in which only RNA segment 6 of FPV is replaced by the corresponding gene of the Hong Kong or Singapore strains. However, recombinants inwhich only RNA segment 1 is replaced form plaques at 33\" of 2 mm in diameter (Table 1) . Thus, replacement of segment 1 by itself is not responsible for microplaque formation, although the overall gene constellation has a certain influence on the plaque morphology (see Table 1 ). Furthermore, several independently isolated recombinants with gene constellations identical to 113/Ho 1 and 113/S 1 all were able to produce only microplaques at 33\" and normal plaques at 37\" (not shown here).",

Furthermore, at 33\" the plaque number does not correlate with the dilution. For example, when at a given dilution the number of countable plaques was about 200, in the next dilution by a factor of 10 only between 2 and 5 plaques were visible, although 20 plaques had been expected.

After two further washings with PBS, the cells were incubated at either 33 or 37\" or were shifted after 1 hr incubation at 37\" down to 33\" according to the schedule outlined in Table  3 . Ten hours later, the HA titers and PFU were determined.

This implies either that more HA is synthesized compared with infectious particles, or that the Notes. Cells were infected with 10 to 50 PFU/cell.

All cells were treated at pH 2.5 after infection and processed at 10 hr after infection. quality of HA is different from that of the parent strain under identical conditions. Next, protein synthesis has been studied by incorporation of [?S]methionine into viral proteins. As can be seen in Fig. 4 , in 113/Ho-infected cells at 33\" very little protein is labeled when compared with cells infected with the adapted strain or the parent viruses. About 10 times more isotope has to be applied in order to get a comparable incorporation (not shown here). Under these conditions, it was found that at 33\" the HA of 113/Ho is cleaved into HA1 and HAz. Labeling of 113/Ho protein did not increase if the ?S pulse was applied later in the infectious cycle (not shown here). These results indicate that a step before virus maturation is impeded at 33' in 113/Ho-infected cells, since labeling of viral proteins is already slowed down at this temperature.",

As can be seen in Fig. 5 , if cells infected by 113/Ho were kept at 33\" and the pulse was given at 37\", the viral proteins were much less labeled when compared with conditions the other way around. For comparison, data on the adapted strain are included. The results suggest that at 33\" the synthesis of viral mRNA is slowed down rather than that of viral protein itself.

However, if the hemagglutination test was performed at 40\" with 113/Ho no agglutination of chicken erythrocytes was visible, in contrast to the adapted strain, or FPV, or Ho, Furthermore, erythrocytes once agglutinated at room temperature by 113/Ho form a central pellet in the cups of the test plate after about 1 hr, depending on the virus dilution, while the agglutination patterns of the other strains stay stable for at least 6 hr or longer. Since there is no difference in neuraminidase activity, it is suggested that, when compared with the other strains, 113/Ho crosslinks red blood cells less firmly after release of some neuraminic ",

DISCUSSION Recombinants and mutants of influenza viruses which multiply well at low but not at the elevated temperatures have been isolated in many laboratories. It might be assumed that certain gene products of these isolates either by themselves or in cooperation with other gene products are impeded in their function by some kind of a melting process or conformational changes at the elevated temperature. However, there are no reports on influenza virus isolates with the opposite property; this means normal multiplication at body temperature but restriction at lower temperatures when compared with the parent strains. Such isolates, if they exist, are expected to have defects in the function of glycoproteins or the membrane (M) protein, which interact with lipid bilayers during their multiplication or assembly, since membranes become more rigid at low temperatures.In this communication, we describe recombinants between FPV and human influenza A strains carrying a N2 neuraminidase which multiply normally at 37\" but only very slowly at 33\" when compared with the parent strains. This property seems to be related to a specific combination of the surface glycoproteins, H'7N2. Recombinants with this gene constellation produce only very tiny or turbid plaques at 33\" (see Table 1 ). Recombinants between FPV and the Hong Kong strain (113/Ho) have been studied in more detail. At 33\", they adsorb and penetrate normally, although the hemagglutinin of these recombinants binds less firmly to red blood cells. Since this latter property is more strongly expressed at elevated temperature, it is not clear whether it is rather circumstantial and not related to the slower multiplication of 113/Ho at low temperatures.At 33\" labeling of viral proteins of 113/ Ho is significantly slowed down. However, since after preincubation at 33\" and pulse at 37\" viral proteins are much less labeled than under conditions the other way around (Fig. 5) , it is suggested that viral mRNA synthesis is impeded at low temperatures rather than that of viral proteins. The possible impairment of viral mRNA synthesis at 33\" is difficult to explain, Interaction of viral glycoproteins during their synthesis on internal membranes might play a role in the regulation of the synthesis of viral mRNA in a way which is not yet understood.It is possible that during reassortment a new \"gene constellation\" is generated, as in the case of 113/Ho, in which an intrinsically cs protein that has been suppressed on the parental strain is now allowed to express a cs phenotype. The recombinant 113/Ho can easily be adapted to grow normally at 33\". The frequency of adaptation corresponds roughly to that of reversion of a single point mutation to wild type (ca. 10e5). Thus, a single mutation might bring either one of the glycoproteins or another gene product into such a conformation that it cooperates normally again at 33\".",
