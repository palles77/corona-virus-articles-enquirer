            "text": "Hybrid hybridomas (quadromas) are derived by fusing at least two hybridomas, each producing a different antibody of predefined specificity. The resulting cell secretes not only the immunoglobulins of both parents but also hybrid molecules manifesting the binding characteristics of the individual fusion partners. Purification of the desired bispecific immunoprobe with high specific activity from a mixture of bispecific and monospecific monoclonal antibodies requires special strategies. Using a dual, sequential affinity chromatography (Protein-G chromatography followed by m-aminophenyleboronic acid agarose column), we have purified bispecific monoclonal antibodies (BsMAb) as a preformed HRPO (Horseradish Peroxidase) complex (BsMAb-HRPO). The quadroma culture supernatant was initially processed on a Protein-G column to isolate all the species of immunoglobulins. This pre-enriched fraction was subsequently passed through the aminophenyleboronic acid column super saturated with HRPO. The column matrix has the ability to bind to proteins such as HRPO with vicinal diols. The enzyme loaded column captures the desired bispecific anti-SARS-CoV \u00d7 anti-HRPO species with the elimination of the monospecific anti-SARS-CoV MAb to result in a high specific activity diagnostic probe. The presence of anti-HRPO MAb is an acceptable impurity as it will not bind to the target SARS-CoV NP antigen and will get washed out during the ELISA procedure. Crown",

            "text": "Bispecific monoclonal antibodies (BsMAb) are unique macromolecules functioning as cross-linkers with two different predetermined binding specificities [1] . These antibodies have unique applications in immunodiagnostics [2, 3] and immunotherapy [4, 5] . Since the report of development of bifunctional antibodies from hybrid hybridomas [6] , increased attention has been focused on these cross-linking immunoprobes incorporating two different paratopes in a single antibody molecule. Our laboratory has extensively adopted the hybrid hybridoma method [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] of generating different BsMAbs for diagnostic applications. Antibodies with enzyme tags are used extensively in biochemical and immunochemical applications. in the literature. Previous work in our laboratory has resulted in the development of several BsMAbs with anti-tumor antigen specificity in one arm and anti-enzyme specificity in, the other arm [8] [9] [10] [11] 14] . Our laboratory has previously purified alkaline phosphatase-labelled BsMAbs using Mimetic Red 3 [10] matrix and the purification of the uncomplexed BsMAb on an HRPO-agarose column [3] . The challenge of obtaining bispecific immunoprobes with high specific activity and purity was circumvented by using benzhydroxamic acid agarose to purify the antibodies [15] tagged with HRPO as a preformed immune complex [15, 16] . Benzhydroxamic acid agarose (BHAagarose) has been reported to bind at the active site of HRPO [17] . Unfortunately, due to the discontinuation of BHA-agarose production by the vendor, we attempted to develop an alternative affinity chromatography method for the purification of BsMAb with one arm specific to HRPO and the other arm specific to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome's (SARS-CoV) nucleoprotein (NP) antigen, using novel boronate affinity matrix called m-aminophenylboronic acid agarose (APBA-agarose). Immobilized phenylboronic acid has been utilized selectively to retain carbohydrates, catecholamines, prostaglandins, ribonucleosides, and steroids [18] [19] [20] . Boronic acid can form reversible bonds with 1,2-or 1,3-diols to generate five or six membered cyclic complexes under mild conditions [21, 22] . Immobilized boronic acid derivatives have been reported to form reversible complexes with diol-containing compounds such as nucleotides [23] nucleosides [24] , nucleic acids [25] and carbohydrates [26] . Use of immobilized phenylboronic acid derivatives to separate diol-containing nucleotide was first suggested nearly four decades ago [24] . The ability of boron to form specific complexes with cis-diols has also been explored to separate glycoproteins [18] . The utilization of the carbohydrate moiety as the binding site has an advantage since these regions are generally not involved with their biological activities [27] . Therefore, many glycoproteins, including hormones [28] , antibodies [29] and enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase, lactamases, hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [30] [31] [32] , retain most of their biological activities even when their carbohydrate regions are modified or altered. We speculated that APBAagarose presaturated with HRPO could purify the BsMAb as HRPO-labelled BsMAb complex. The advantages of BsMAb over monospecific MAb are (1) two non identical paratopes incorporated in a single antibody for efficient cross linking avoiding chemical conjugation, (2) reduces the assay format by one step in turn reducing the time for the assay, (3) and very low signal to noise ratio due to molecular uniformity of BsMAb, (4) the bispecific design can generate the theoretical limit of tracer specific activity with every molecule bound to HRPO, (5) the quadromas can generate abundant BsMAb thus providing the detecting antibody in the total absence of random crosslinking of the enzyme. Here we describe the alternative method for purification of HRPO-labelled BsMAb for application in immunoassays.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) represent one of the fastest growing areas of new diagnostic and drug development within the pharmaceutical industry. A number of applications using MAb involve chemical manipulation of the antibody to cre- ate covalent immunoconjugates with enzymes, drugs, etc. Refinement in chemical conjugation methods, employing heterobifunctional cross-linkers, has mitigated the problem of random conjugations but not entirely eliminated them [33] . BsMAb with intrinsic binding sites to any two antigens has the capability to form uniform, homogenous, and reproducible high specific activity immunoconjugates with one or two entities in predetermined order [2] . The cross-linking ability of BsMAb to any two defined antigens makes them a better alternative to the widely used chemical covalent cross-linking methods, at least in major areas of applied immunology; immunoassays, immunohistochemistry and immunotargeting. A wide range of potential applications employing these probes have been described in literature [7, [11] [12] [13] 16] . One of the major limitations for use of BsMAb produced by hybrid hybridoma is the production of parental monospecific antibodies along with BsMAb. Hence the purification of BsMAb is essential. Our laboratory has exploited the property benzhydroxamic acid agarose (BHA) binding to peroxidase for purifying BsMAb with covalently or non-covalently bound HRPO. Due to the commercial non-availability of BHA (UpFront Chromatography, Copenhagan, Denmark), we attempted to develop an alternative affinity chromatography method for the purification of BsMAb with one arm specific to HRPO and the other arm specific to SARS-CoV nucleoprotein antigen, using a novel boronate affinity gel available as m-aminophenylboronic acid agarose. Because of binding of HRPO to ABPA, purification of BsMAb inevitably yields antibodies which are bound to HRPO and have higher specific activity. It is to be emphasized that when purifying BsMAbs with either BHA or APBA, free HRPO and monospecific anti-HRPO also gets co-purified. However, the presence of monospecific anti-HRPO antibodies complexed with HRPO is not an issue because this will not be able to bind the target NP antigen coated plates and thus will be washed out in the ELISA. The elution conditions of the affinity chromatography are very mild and potassium phosphate buffer containing 0.1 M sorbitol is used which is of routine use in all biological applications. This procedure can be adopted for affinity purification of any protein attached to peroxidase such as chemical conjugates of antibodies. The purified HRPO/anti-HRPO bispecific antibody immune complex could be directly used for in vitro diag- nostics or immunohistology, wherein the second arm of the bispecific antibody binds specifically to a target, such as SARS-CoV antigen, or a tumor marker. There is no common purification method for BsMAb. A combination of Protein-A, ion-exchange chromatography, size exclusion chromatographic techniques has been used to purify BsMAb from a mixture of mono and bispecific species. These non-specific methods are subjected to trial and error [34] and can be time consuming. The use of benzhydroxamic acid agarose was an ideal method [16] to quickly and easily purify BsMAb labelled with HRPO.",
