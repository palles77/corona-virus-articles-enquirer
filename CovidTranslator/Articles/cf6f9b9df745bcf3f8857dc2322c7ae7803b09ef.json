This work evaluated the potential of a cultivated serviceberry species as a functional food by characterising its physicochemical characteristics, antioxidant capacity, vitamin C, phenolics and other phytochemicals selected as health-promoting biomarkers, using high-performance liquid chromatography. The most important compound class identified was polyphenols (62.10%), followed by organic acids (22.63%), monoterpenes (7.95%), and vitamins (7.32%). Results showed that serviceberry fruits could be good sources of phenolic constituents, as catechins (343.46 \u00b1 29.46 mg/ 100 gFW), anthocyanins (220.66 \u00b1 17.43 mg/100 gFW), and tannins (209.29 \u00b1 7.81 mg/100 gFW) (FW = fresh weight). These results highlight the potential role of A. canadensis fruits as a functional food. Further studies are needed to identify several genotypes for breeding to get suitable cultivars for fresh consumption and processing.",

Rising consumer incomes, changes in lifestyle and demographics, and shifting preferences due to advanced knowledge about the relationship between food and health contribute to new demands for foods (Dolgopolova, Teuber, & Bruschi, 2015) . Today, foods are intended to not only satisfy hunger and provide necessary nutrients, but also to prevent nutritionrelated diseases and improve physical and mental well-being (Annunziata & Vecchio, 2011) : functional foods could play an important role in human health. Underutilised fruits, as serviceberry, could be an important source of health promoting phytonutrients with medicinal properties. Furthermore, these fruits have often high pigment contents, which could represent an alternative to synthetic dyes (Rymbai et al., 2016) . The genus Amelanchier (family Rosaceae) is represented by approximately 25 species widespread in North America and in parts of Eurasia (Michalczyk & Macura, 2010) . Serviceberry is native to North America from Alaska, across western Canada, and in the western and north-central USA (Lim, 2012) . It is less known and rarely grown in Europe (except Scandinavian countries) in spite of its high frost resistance, decorative value as a shrub, and edible fruits (Bakowska- Barczak, Marianchuk, & Kolodziejczyk, 2007) . In its native environment, serviceberry is found in thickets, woodland margins, banks of streams, canyons, and hillsides, from sea level to 3000 m altitude. It prefers a rich, well-drained loamy soil but it can also grow in any sandy or clayey soil that is not waterlogged or too dry. It is relatively drought and salt tolerant and thrives in a sunny or semishade position (Lim, 2012) .",

It has a variable habitus but it is usually found as a multi-stemmed shrub ranging from 2-3 m in height: some genotypes are cultivated for commercial fruit production in western USA and Canada. Its fruits are approximately 1 cm in diameter, blue-purple and ripen in July (Hu, Kwok, & Kitts, 2005) . A. arborea (Downy serviceberry) is an eastern North American large shrub or small tree 8-10 m high and is crossed with A. laevis to produce cultivars for the landscape industry in the USA. The fruits of A. arborea are purple-black, slightly sweet and ripen in late June (Adhikari, Francis, Schutzki, Chandra, & Nair, 2005) . A. canadensis (Shadblow serviceberry) is another eastern North American species. It ripens in early June and it is used in the landscape trade. It is a stoloniferous shrub or small tree reaching 8 m in height with a fastigiate crown and smooth ash-grey bark. Twigs are slender, reddish-brown becoming glabrous during flowering, while leaves are alternate, simple, oval-obovate to nearly round. The maroon-purple fruits are similar to A. arborea ones (pome, 7-15 mm across, glabrous, wax-coated) (Lim, 2012) .",

The fruits are also been added into cider, wine, beer, or tea (Adhikari et al., 2005; Bakowska-Barczak & Kolodziejczyk, 2008) . The native people and early settlers of the North American prairies used serviceberry as one of their main food sources, but its use was limited because of its natural distribution area in the wild. In the last two decades, however, there has been growing interest in the industrial cultivation and utilisation of this fruit in Canada and USA (Michigan) (Adhikari et al., 2005; Kershaw, 2000) . Fruit processing has an important role in exploiting the raw material because serviceberry has a relatively short harvest period (Michalczyk & Macura, 2010) . Innovative methods of processing, freezing, and packaging have greatly increased the uses of this fruit. Moreover, growers are promoting it as a potential functional food (Jamin, 2009 ), alongside other fruit species, as Ribes nigrum (Donno et al., 2013b) , Morus nigra (Donno, Cerutti, Prgomet, Mellano, & Beccaro, 2015c) and Lycium spp. (Donno, Beccaro, Mellano, Cerutti, & Bounous, 2015a) .",

There are few reports concerning the chemical composition of Amelanchier spp.: phytochemical studies on A. canadensis are rarely found in the literature. However, the available literature usually emphasises its important health benefits: serviceberry appears to be an excellent source of manganese, magnesium, and iron, and a relatively good source of calcium, potassium, copper, and carotenoids (e.g. lutein). Moreover, the fruit is rich in nutraceuticals, particularly phenolic compounds, as anthocyanins, chlorogenic acid, catechins and rutin (Bakowska-Barczak & Kolodziejczyk, 2008; Bakowska-Barczak et al., 2007) . In addition, Amelanchier spp. seed oil may serve as a potential dietary source of tocopherols, sterols, and unsaturated fatty acids (Lim, 2012) .",

Wolfe and Wood (1971) found that the sugar content slowly increased as the fruit matured and then considerably accelerated before ripening: fructose content greatly decreased (\u221225%) after the fruit ripened while the glucose content remained unaltered. The pH of wild fruits, as reported in previous studies (Cazares-Franco et al., 2014; Lim, 2012) , is often lower than the pH of cultivated fruits: the higher pH indicates that the cultivated fruit is a low-acid food, a positive sensory feature, as confirmed by TA values reported in this study. Moreover, a lower TSS/TA ratio than other ",

            "text": "Studies by Hosseinian and Beta (2007) showed that serviceberry had high potential value for the fresh market and foodderived manufacturers, because of their high polyphenolic content, in particular, anthocyanins.TheTPC (539.24 \u00b1 29.20 mgGAE/ 100gFW) and TAC (220.66 \u00b1 17.43 mgC3G/100gFW) values obtained from the analysed extracts are reported in Table 4 . Anthocyanins and total phenolics in serviceberries increase with fruit ripening (Lim, 2012) . The phenolic compounds found in fruits and vegetables have attracted much interest due to their beneficial properties (Faller & Fialho, 2010) . Based on the TPC, serviceberry fruits are excellent polyphenolic sources compared with commonly consumed fruits. For example,TPC reported for some berries (e.g. raspberry, blueberry, strawberry, and blackcurrant) (Donno et al., 2013b (Donno et al., , 2015c were markedly lower than TPC reported in this study for serviceberry. Moreover, a high positive correlation between TPC and antioxidant capacity has been established (Donno et al., 2012; Faller & Fialho, 2010) : therefore, A. canadensis is a very attractive fruit species from a functional point of view. In other studies (Lim, 2012) , anthocyanin content was correlated with TPC,TA, pH, and sugar : acid ratio.The results in Tables 3 and 4 suggested that high content of anthocyanins in serviceberries could be associated with high TPC and low pH and sugar : acid ratio. Hellstr\u00f6m, Sinkkonen, Karonen, and Mattila (2007) found that fruits of different serviceberry genotypes contained proanthocyanidins from dimers to heptamers and higher polymers. In serviceberry, proanthocyanidins were generally of the procyanidin type, mainly consisting of epicatechin units linked by B-type bonds. Bakowska- Barczak et al. (2007) found serviceberries contained the following anthocyanidins: cyanidin, delphinidin, pelargonidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin. In the current research, only TAC was considered. The FRAP assay was used to evaluate antioxidant capacity of A. canadensis fruits. The FRAP assay is based on the ability of antioxidants to reduce ferric(III) ions to ferrous(II) ions: it is a simple and widely used method to evaluate antioxidant capacity (Donno et al., 2015a; Fu et al., 2011) . In this study, fresh fruits showed a mean FRAP value of 25.07 \u00b1 0.48 mmol Fe 2+ \u00b7 kg \u22121 (Table 4 ). Thus, serviceberry presented a higher FRAP value compared to some common fruit, as black mulberry, goji, raspberry, and apple (Donno et al., 2015c) . Antioxidant activity values of the above mentioned common fruits are reported in other studies (Cazares-Franco et al., 2014; Michalczyk & Macura, 2010) . On the basis of TAC and TPC measurements, it would appear that the antioxidant properties of serviceberry fruits are mainly affected by anthocyanins (Pearson correlation index for TAC/ antioxidant activity presented a value of 0.73).",

The TBCC was calculated as the sum of the main biomarkers selected for their healthy properties and detected in the extracts. Results showed a mean TBCC value of 1549.36 \u00b1 22.77 mg/ 100 gFW. These biomarkers were selected for the fingerprint because they have been described as important healtheffective molecules in humans (de Cassia da Silveira e Sa, Andrade, & de Sousa, 2013). The phytochemical fingerprint of serviceberry fruit has been described: 20 bioactive compounds were identified by HPLC-DAD (Mazza, 1982; Ozga, Saeed, Wismer, & Reinecke, 2007) . In this study, A. canadensis fruits showed the following bioactive compound composition: four cinnamic acids (caffeic, chlorogenic, coumaric, and ferulic acids), five flavonols (hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercetin, quercitrin, rutin), one benzoic acid (ellagic acid), one catechin (epicatechin), two tannins (castalagin, vescalagin), two monoterpenes (limonene, \u03b3-terpinene), three organic acids (oxalic, succinic, and tartaric acids), and vitamin C (expressed as the sum of ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid). Catechin, phellandrene, sabinene, terpinolene, and citric, malic, gallic and quinic acids were not detected, in agreement with serviceberry fruit phytochemical fingerprints reported in similar studies (Jur\u00edkov\u00e1 et al., 2013; Michalczyk & Macura, 2010) . Other peaks were detected in the obtained chromatograms, but they did not match any of the biomarkers used in the present work. Further studies, adding other biomarkers with demonstrated biological activity, are needed for a complete identification of the chromatogram. The identified health-promoting agents were grouped into classes to evaluate the single contribution of each class to total fruit phytocomplex composition (Fig. 1) . The phytochemical fingerprint showed the prevalence of polyphenols (as the sum of anthocyanins, cinnamic acids, flavonols, benzoic acids, catechins, and tannins) and organic acids in all the analysed samples (mean values were considered). Indeed, the most important class was polyphenols (62.12 \u00b1 1.68%), followed by organic acids (22.62 \u00b1 0.75%), monoterpenes (7.94 \u00b1 0.57%), and vitamins (7.31 \u00b1 0.63%).",

The high content of tannins in serviceberry fruits is interesting, thanks to their wellknown association with human health, as anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic agents important in protecting cells by oxidative damages (Chung, Wong, Wei, Huang, & Lin, 1998) . Although flavonols are not the main phenolic components of serviceberry fruits, they should be considered in the phytochemical profile of Amelanchier spp. fruits, since they may exert critical beneficial features related to human health (Del Rio et al. 2013 ).",

This study demonstrated that serviceberry fruits present a plethora of phytochemicals with the capacity to promote health and protect against chronic diseases. The results of this study provided a detailed assessment of the quality, chemical characteristics, and potential of a cultivated edible serviceberry as a functional fresh fruit. Substantial amounts of simple phenolics, as chlorogenic, coumaric and ferulic acids, and flavonols are present in this fruit. Some of these simple phenolics, together with complex polyphenols, monoterpenes and other phytochemicals (organic acids and vitamin C) make serviceberry an alternative fruit that could contribute to the prevention of chronic diseases resulting from oxidative stress. Finally, as the opportunity for medium-scale production on marginal lands, further studies are needed to investigate this genotype by environment interactions and identify several genotypes suitable for fresh consumption, processing, or breeding research.",
