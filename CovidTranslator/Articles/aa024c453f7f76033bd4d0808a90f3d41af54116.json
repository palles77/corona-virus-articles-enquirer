Of 52 sputa from 38 patients, 12 (23%) samples from 12 patients were positive for a respiratory virus (4 for influenza B, 3 for parainfluenza 1, 3 for influenza A and 2 for respiratory syncytial virus). These results suggest that the RT-PCR method carried out on sputum may provide a convenient means of investigating the role of virus infection in lung exacerbations of cystic fibrosis patients. Recent studies have indicated that respiratory viral infec-",

RT-PCR has been used to detect respiratory viruses in the sputum of asthma patients [6] . We recently developed a multiplex-RT-PCR assay combined with colorimetric amplicon detection (m-RT-PCR-ELAHA) for the detection of seven respiratory viruses in the NPA of non-CF patients [7] . In the study reported here the assay was used to detect respiratory viruses in sputa collected from adult patients with CF. . Ten patients provided multiple sputa (range, 1-4 samples). Selection of patients for the study was based on production of sufficient sputum for analysis. Each sputum sample collected on admission was equally divided, with one half sent for routine microbiology testing and the other for virus analysis. The 38 patients were representative of the patient population in the RPAH CF clinic in terms of age (sample and clinic populations both had a mean age of 26 years [SD= 6 years]), gender balance (identical) and baseline lung function (49% [SD=21%] predicted for the sample compared to 49% [SD=39%] for the whole clinic). Diagnosis of CF was confirmed in all cases by genotyping or the sweat test. Respiratory exacerbation is defined as a change in the patient's condition warranting intravenous antibiotic therapy based on deterioration in at least four of the following parameters: sputum, haemoptysis, cough, dyspnoea, malaise/fatigue, exercise tolerance, fever, anorexia or weight loss, sinusitis, forced vital capacity or forced expiratory volume in 1 s (decreased 10% from previous recorded value), radiographic changes and chest sounds. Fifteen of the 38 (39%) patients had experienced exacerbations over the preceding 12 months (mean, 1.5; range, 0-4). The demographic characteristics, lung function, number of days as hospital inpatient and concomitant conditions of the patients are shown in Table 1 .",
