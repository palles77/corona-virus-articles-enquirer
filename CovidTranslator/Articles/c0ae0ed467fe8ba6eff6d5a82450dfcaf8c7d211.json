The IgY was produced by immunizing hens with cell wall proteins of T. rubrum, extracted from eggs by PEG precipitation and then purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The cross-reactivity (CR) with other fungi, growth inhibition on T. rubrum in vitro and therapeutic effect on T. rubrum infection in BALB/C mice of the specific IgY were then evaluated. Anti-T. rubrum cell wall proteins IgY (anti-trCWP IgY) presented a certain degree of cross-reactivity with different fungi. In the in vitro and in vivo activity researches, Anti-trCWP IgY showed a significant dose-dependent growth inhibitory effect on T. rubrum in vitro and a significant dose-dependent therapeutic effect on T. rubrum infection in BALB/C mice.",

Dermatophytes have been classified into three genera, Trichophyton, Microsporum and,Epidermophyton. T. rubrum is particularly responsible for the major infections of dermatophytes [4, 5] , which is a kind of filamentous fungus that may cause tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis [6] .",

The studies showed that S. aureus specific IgYs could inhibit the growth of S. aureus and the internalization of S. aureus by bovine mammary epithelial cells, and could decrease the bacterial count in milk and cure experimental mastitis (83.3%) and clinical mastitis (50%). IgYs were observed ineffective to lyse Gram-positive bacteria, especially the encapsulated strain, but presented some inhibitory effect under growth conditions. E. coli specific IgYs could inhibit the growth of E. coli bybeing bound with it in a dose-dependent manner and enhance phagocytosis of E. coli by milk macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes.",

In the study, anti-C. albicans IgY significantly reduced the adherence capacity of C. albicans to human pharynx carcinoma cells. Oral administration of anti-C. albicans IgY by mice significantly reduced the number of C. albicans and the scores of tongue lesions; anti-C. albicans IgY also reduced colonization of C. albicans in mouse organs, indicating that anti-C. albicans IgY had a protective effect against the oral candidiasis of experimentally infected mice and reduced the dissemination of C. albicans [26] .",

Many studies have shown that cell wall proteins have good immunogenicity and can induce specific antibodies [28] [29] [30] . In our study, the cell wall proteins showed good immunogenicity, highest titer of anti-trCWP IgY reaching 1:16000. The anti-trCWP IgY expressed significant inhibitory effect on T. rubrum in a dose-dependent manner compared with IgY from unimmunized hens,and significantly reduced lesion scores of mice experimentally infected with T. rubrum.

The first step of dermatophytes to infect the host is to inoculate the germinating fungus into the skin, which adheres to the cuticle. The occlusion and impregnation of the cuticle accelerate the adhesion process. The fungal spores sprout after being adhered to the cuticle for a long time; the mycelia continue to spread, especially in the lower layer of the cuticle [32] . Anti-trCWP IgY may be directly bound to the proteins on the fungal cell wall, inhibit the proliferation of T. rubrum, reduce the adherence capacity of T. rubrum to host cells and prevent further invasion of the fungal hypha to the host.",
