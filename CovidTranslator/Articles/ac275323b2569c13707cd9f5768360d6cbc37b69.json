            "text": "A reversed passive hemagglutination (I~PHA) method was developed for the detection of bovine eoronavirus in fecal specimens. Sheep erythrocytes fixed with glutaraldehyde, and then treated with tannic acid were coated with anti-bovine coronavirus rabbit antibodies purified by affinity chromatography using bovine eoronavirus linked to Sepharose 4B. The RPHA test was carried out by a microtiter method. Erythrocytes coated with purified specific antibodies were agglutinated by bovine coronavirus, but not by bovine rotavirus or enterovirus. The reaction was inhibited by antiserum to bovine coronavirus, confirming the specificity of the reaction. The I~PIIA test detected bovine coronavirus in 13 of 22 fecal specimens (59 per cent), from natural cases of diarrhea, while the positive rates were only 14 per cent (3/22) and 22 per cent (5/22) for immunofluorescent staining of primary cultures of calf kidney cells infected with the specimens, and immune electron microscopy respectively. The advantages of the I~PHA method are its simplicity, high sensitivity and rapidity.",

The virus multiplied in bovine embryonic kidney cell cultures, but failed to induce a readily recognizable cytopathic effect. Therefore although the virus may be assayed in these cultures, the method is rather cumbersome, as the presence of virus is detected either b y the microscopic examination of stained cultures, or b y immunofluorescence with a specific antiserum (10) . I~ABA et al. (7) have d e m o n s t r a t e d t h a t the virus replicates readily producing a m a r k e d cytopathic effect in cultures of the continuous cell lines. B E K -1 , derived from bovine embryonic kidney, thus providing a sensitive, practical assay m e t h o d for the virus and neutralizing antibody. A hemagglutination-inhibition test was also developed (14, 16) . More recently TAXAHASm et al. (18) have isolated a bovine coronavirus strain from feces in an o u t b r e a k of diarrhea a m o n g adult cows in p r i m a r y cultures of calf kidney cells. H o w e v e r a cytopathic effect was not detected until the 8th blind passage. The demonstration of the virus in diarrheal feces b y virus isolation and electron microscopy is therefore time consuming and the procedures are elaborate.",

Using these erythrocytes the R P H A titer was determined for a concentrated suspension of purified bovine coronavirus with a titer of l0 s.2 TCIDs0/0.1 ml. The results are summarized in Table 1 . Erythrocytes treated with antibody concentrations from 1 to 60 izg/ml gave an R P H A titer of 1 : 64 whereas those treated with 70 to 100 tzg/ml antibody gave an R P H A titer of 1:128. Coated erythrocytes did not agglutinate in the absence of the virus, and virus did not agglutinate erythrocytes fixed with glutaraldehyde or fixed erythrocytes and treated with tannic acid. Based on these results erythrocytes coated with 80 ~g/ml of the purified antibodies were used in the following experiments. A concentrated suspension of bovine rotavirus with a titer of 10 s.2 TCIDs0/0.1 ml and a similar suspension of bovine enterovirus with a titer of 109.2 TCIDs0/0.1 ml gave negative results in the I~PHA test providing further confirmation of the specificity of the test. The fecal specimen from which the Kakegawa strain of bovine coronavirus was isolated (18) , gave an R P H A titer of 1:16. In the virus dilution method of R P H A inhibition, a 10-fold dilution of the rabbit antiserum against bovine coronavirus completely inhibited hemagglutination produced by the concentrated suspension of bovine coronavirus as well as that due to the fecal specimen which yielded the Kakegawa strain. The pre-immunization serum as well as antisera against bovine rotavirus and enterovirus did not inhibit the R P t I A reaction. In the serum dilution method of R P H A inhibition the antiserum had a titer of 1:512.",

The R P H A reaction occurred only with bovine coronavirus, not with bovine rotavirus or enterovirus, and the reaction was inhibited by antiserum against bovine eoronavirus, whereas no inhibition could be demonstrated with pre-immunization sera or antisera against bovine rotavirus and enterovirus. Furthermore the fecal specimen which yielded the Kakegawa strain of bovine coronavirus (18) , had a R P H A titer of 1:16 and the reaction was specifically inhibited by antiserum against the virus. Bovine coronavirus was detected by R P H A more frequently in the feces of those cattle which had a rise in H I antibody to the virus than of those which did not. This observation provides further evidence of the specificity of R P H A test. However, the observed difference was not statistically significant, and further confirmation of this finding is required. The concentration of purified specific antibodies to bovine coronavirus used for the coating of erythrocytes was important in obtaining a high sensitivity for the test. The rate of detection of bovine coronavirus in the fecal specimen from natural cases was higher (59 per cent) by the R P H A method than by the I F staining technique (14 per cent) or electron microscopy (27 per cent). However, these results require further confirmation as the differences observed were not statistically significant. The R P H A test could find wide application in the study of bovine coronavirus infections in cattle. R P H A may also be applicable to other viral infections such rotavirus infection of cattle and transmissible gastroenteritis of swine, in which virus is excreted in abundance in the feces.",
