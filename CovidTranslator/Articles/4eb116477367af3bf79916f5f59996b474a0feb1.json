The genetic similarity the insect showed with those found on chimpanzees from his field site in Uganda's Kibale National Park-as well as the appearance of such ticks in up-close images of these animals' noses-led Goldberg to believe that his nasal invader was probably an uncharacterized species that had adapted to living in chimp nostrils as a defense against grooming 1 . Perhaps more importantly, the fact that the tick had successfully infested a person's nose canal-his own-meant that Goldberg had inadvertently documented a potential new route of zoonotic pathogen transmission to humans.",

One of the most famous examples of such a zoonotic pathogen is HIV, which is thought to have spread to humans after hunters and butchers in Africa came into contact with the meat of primates infected with SIV, a closely related simian virus. However, monkeys and apes are only one potential reservoir for new human diseases. Just last month, for example, scientists pinpointed camels as the direct source of the virus responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome 3,4 , a new disease that has claimed more than 300 lives since it was discovered in 2012. Bats, rodents and various other mammals host a large number of emerging diseases, too.",

The researchers-including Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York, and Jonna Mazet, executive director of the One Health Institute at the University of California-Davisextrapolated those results and came up with a minimum estimate of 320,000 mammalian viruses that await discovery, any of which could conceivably be responsible for the next human pandemic 5 .

The current EDCTP program is drawing to a close, but the Netherlands-based organization is gearing up for a second phase of the initiative, known as EDCTP2. So far, 14 European countries have signed up as members of EDCTP2 and have pledged a combined total of \u20ac683 million to the partnership, which is hoped to launch by the end of this year and last until 2023. Of the 16 countries that participated in EDCTP1, Belgium, Greece and Switzerland have not yet joined; Finland was not a member of the program's first phase but has signed all mammalian viruses-$6.3 billion-is still far less than the economic impact of containing even a single pandemic like SARS, which researchers estimate cost the global economy close to $40 billion in 2003 alone 6 . But Goldberg emphasizes the need to focus on how the diseases spread: \"I'm deeply excited by pathogen discovery-I love it and I do it in my lab-but I think it needs a complementary approach from the ecological and social sciences,\" Goldberg says. \"We should strive to ramp up pathway discovery now that we are in this golden age of pathogen discovery. Together, the two approaches will give us the information we really need.\"",
