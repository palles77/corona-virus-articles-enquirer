There has been no epidemiological study of pneumococcal/lobar pneumonia and empyema in Taiwan, a middle-income Asian population. Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance database, we collected and analyzed data obtain from medical care claims related to pneumococcal/ lobar pneumonia and empyema for children below the 18 years old from 1997 to 2004. We found the annual population-based incidence to have significant year to year increases and the average annual incidences of pneumococcal/ lobar pneumonia and empyema in children under five to be 44.9 and 10.5 episodes per 100,000 children-year, respectively. About 64% of children with pneumococcal/ lobar pneumonia and empyema were under 5 years old. Children 4 to 5 years old had the highest incidences of both pneumococcal/lobar pneumonia and empyema.",

According to the World Health Organization, S. pneumoniae is the leading cause of severe pneumonia worldwide in children younger than 5 years old, causing more than one million deaths in children each year [19] . Empyema, one of the most severe complications of bacterial pneumonia, has been reported in 20% to 30% of all cases in Utah of USA [2] . Although the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease has decreased since the use of pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV) [4] , developed countries such as USA have seen an emergence of empyema and necrotizing pneumonia episodes caused by nonvaccine serotypes [1, 3] . In Taiwan, the represented pneumococcal serotypes in hospitalized children with invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) were serotypes 14, 19F, 3, 6B, and 23F, and the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines covered 73% of IPD cases in children aged between 2 and 4 years and 65% of cases in children aged <2 years [11, 12] . To date, little research has been done into the epidemiology and population-based incidence of pneumococcal/lobar pneumonia and empyema in the Asian and subtropical areas.",

Furthermore, 63.4% of those complicated with empyema also received invasive procedures of chest tube insertions and/or thoracotomies. Of 1,169 patients with empyema, 66 (5.6%) cases received lung excision and bronchus. Children with pneumococcal/ lobar pneumonia and those children with empyema had a crude case fatality rate of 0.43% (range 0.19-0.61%) and 2.74% (range 1.02-5.07%), respectively.

A rapid diagnostic tool, the urine pneumococcal antigen test (Binax NOW, Binax, USA), was introduced to Taiwan in 2000. This test is reported to be useful for diagnosing pneumococcal pneumonia cases due to its high specificity, though it has also reported to have a 15% false-positive rate in younger children [15, 16] . Since this test was introduced, there has been a significant increase in the annual population-based incidence of pneumococcal/lobar pneumonia. We were not sure whether this increasing trend is due to this better and more convenient diagnostic tool.",

The current study, however, found incidence of pneumococcal/lobar pneumonia to reach a peak between the ages of 4 and 5 years old. The age distribution pattern of empyema cases was similar to that of pneumococcal/lobar pneumonia. The difference in age distribution may be due to the greater number of virus etiologies causing pneumonia in younger children [14, 17] as well as the higher colonization rates of pneumococci in kindergarteners [13] . One 1998 study reported pneumococcal carriage rate to be 19.9% in northern Taiwan population and the isolation rate to be higher in children aged between Fig. 4 The annual population-based incidence of empyema in children under 2, 2-5, and 5-18 years old from 1997 to 2004 in Taiwan Fig. 5 The age-specific incidence of empyema from 1997 to 2004 in Taiwan 2 and 5 years [13] . Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that high pneumococcus colonization rate may contribute to peak in incidence of lobar/pneumococcal pneumonia and empyema in this age group. Furthermore, this population might benefit from a universal pneumococcal vaccination program since seven-valent conjugated vaccine can cover about 70% of IPD cases in this age group in Taiwan [12] .",
