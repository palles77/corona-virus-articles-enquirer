            "text": "NamDinh virus (NDiV), named after a Vietnamese province, was isolated from mosquitoes and is yet to be linked to any pathology. Recently, molecular biology methods were used to identify this mosquito-borne virus as possessing a 20.192 kb genome, the largest genome among non-segmented single-stranded RNA viruses of insects, and its characteristics have defined NDiV as the prototype of a new member of the order Nidovirales (Nga et al., 2011) . Members of the Nidovirales have a wide range of hosts including crustaceans, fishes, birds and a variety of mammals (Siddell et al., 2005) . They included the Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae and Roniviridae families that are known to re-arrange host cell membranes for the purpose of replication and assembly. However, many details of these processes remain obscure, and knowledge of the ultrastructural characterization and the various steps in the replication process of these viruses in cell culture is still very limited. Using improved cryo-fixation methods, electron tomography and immunogold electron microscopy (EM), (2012) showed recently that the arteriviral RNA is present within double-membrane vesicles, but no obvious communication with the cytoplasm was detectable. These authors also investigated the structure of the nidovirus-induced membrane modifications and found that these viruses transform the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into a reticulo-vesicular network that integrates numerous inter-connected double-membrane vesicles (Knoops, 2011) . Here we have applied EM methods to investigate the morphological and ultrastructural features of NDiV grown in C6/36 mosquito cells via ultrathin sections, negative staining and immunogold labeling. The results provide useful information regarding NDiV, the first insect nidovirus identified in mosquitoes.",

In many cells, 48 h post-infection, the numerous aggregates of viral nucleocapsid-like particles appeared to migrate to the cell surface ( Fig. 3 ). At this time point, budding particles were detectable in some cells as protrusions from the plasma membrane; viral nucleocapsid-like particles appeared close to the plasma membrane where putative proteins of the viral envelope had associated (Fig. 4) . In the mature period (48 h after infection; budding process), the NDiV clearly appeared at the level of plasma membrane protrusions: the viral envelope consisted in a trilaminar membrane including the host membrane. At this final stage (just before cell lysis), the virus particles appeared ready to bud ( Fig. 4b and c) as complete virions (black arrowheads) or as incomplete virions (white arrowheads).",

This study describes the morphogenesis and ultrastructural characterization of NDiV by ultrathin sections, negative staining and immunogold EM. NDiV replication appeared to occur in the cytoplasm of the host cells as is the case for other single-stranded RNA viruses (Denison, 2008) . Viral nucleocapsid-like particles also accumulated in cell vacuoles and in the ER which showed swollen cisternae. Other nidoviruses replicate their genomes in the cytoplasm in association with intracellular membrane rearrangements as single-or doublemembrane vesicles (Knoops et al., 2012; Knoops, 2011) . However, the exact sites of RNA synthesis and the relationships between these membrane vesicles and the cytoplasm remain undefined. In this study, the nucleocapsid-like particle of NDiV was identified in the host cell cytoplasm as possessing a round shape and an inner core observed in several types of vesicles and in the ER and its viral nature was confirmed by immunogold labeling on thin sections. In contrast to members of the Coronaviridae family such as SARS-CoV, NDiV particles are formed on membranes of the \"budding compartment\", a term used to describe the continuous membranous system from the ER to the Golgi complex. In our study, replication of NDiV in the cytoplasm of C6/36 cells closely follows the ER and vesicular localization, and the viral nucleocapsid-like particle accumulates in endoplasmic vesicles as does the replication complex for coronaviruses. Certain doublemembrane vesicles also contain dark granular material interspersed among viral nucleocapsid-like particles (Goldsmith et al., 2004; Knoops et al., 2008; Le et al., 2011) , while virions bud from the cytosol. However, we could not identify any opening or pore in these vesicles or in the ER that would allow movement of the viral RNA from the vesicles or ER compartments to the cytosol. Replication of NDiV in C6/36 mosquito cells was followed by a maturation period on the plasma membrane during which viral nucleocapsid-like particles were inserted into \"protrusions\" of this membrane to export the complete virions and the incomplete virions lacking the nucleocapsid. Assembly and budding of NDiV have characteristics in common with those of other members of several RNA virus families such as the Togaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Retroviridae (Ahmad et al., 2011; Haenni and Diaz-Ferrao, 2011; Hunter, 2001; Rota et al., 2003; Zhong et al., 2013) . Assembly of NDiV at the plasma membrane obviates the need for the assembled particle to navigate to an additional compartment of the secretory pathway because the virions are released directly into the external milieu of the cell. For most enveloped viruses, the location within the cell where envelopment takes place is determined by targeting of the viral glycoprotein(s) at that site (Hunter, 2001) . However, the proteins of NDiV have only been identified by molecular biology techniques (Nga et al., 2011) , so that the biological functions of these proteins are not fully understood. Furthermore, viral nucleocapsid-like particles may be morphologically confused with other structures in the cytoplasm such as coated vesicles, multivesicular bodies, perichromatin granules and glycocalyceal bodies. Immunogold EM of ultrathin sections confirmed that these viral nucleocapsid-like particles belong to NDiV and appear in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic compartments of the host cells, whereas no viral structures were found in the mitochondria or the nucleus.",

            "text": "NDiV isolated from C6/36 cells and highlighted by negative staining presented a homogenous spherical shape. Yet NDiV differs from Cavally virus, a novel insect nidovirus characterized in 2011 as an enveloped spherical CoV-like virion with a diameter of 120 nm, and \"club-shaped\" surface projections (Zirkel et al., 2011) . NDiV is an enveloped virus, whose projections or spikes on the membrane of the viral envelope remain very short, 3-4 nm long and that can identify and bind to receptor sites on the host cell membrane. In addition to the negative staining method, the NDiV was examined by immunogold labeling that expanded the range of applicability of the negative staining technique (Beesley and Betts, 1985; Nguyen et al., 2001) . Immunogold EM makes it possible to detect and locate proteins of antigens in viruses or cells and can help connect a visible structure with a specific in situ localization site and establish the distribution of a molecule at high resolution (Beesley and Betts, 1985; De Paul et al., 2012; Hyatt and Eaton, 1993; Nguyen et al., 2001; Kanak et al., 2002) . Immunogold EM on unfixed particles of NDiV revealed labeling of the envelope protein(s) by the presence of 10 nm gold particles around isolated virions. In our experiments, NDiVs are labeled with an average of 15 gold particles per virion using polyclonal antibodies prepared against the entire viral particle. This value probably reflects the topographic distribution of the viral proteins in non-fixed virus particles, and the accessibility of specific epitope constituents. However, its resolution is limited by the steric hindrance generated by the packing density of the antigenic sites associated with different constituents of the viral envelope. NDiV possesses four virion proteins (p2a, p2b, p3, and p4) as demonstrated previously but the number of antigenic sites of NDiV is still unknown (Nga et al., 2011) . With respect to nidoviruses, information concerning the viral envelope proteins of members of the Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae families is available (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1984; Pedersen et al., 1999) , but information on the NDiV envelope proteins as well as on the biological functions of these proteins during replication in the host cell requires further studies with the support of specific monoclonal antibodies against the NDiV proteins.",

The dose injected was increased to 150 mg NDiV particles diluted in 0.5 ml PBS mix with Titermax classic adjuvant, in a 1:1 ratio for the fifth booster injection on day 35. Two weeks after the fifth injection, the IgG titer of the antibodies against NDiV was determined by the indirect ELISA method and the IgGs were separated; blood was taken from the rabbit heart, kept at room temperature for 30 min, and then at 4 1C overnight. The blood was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 15 min, and the serum was separated and kept in aliquots at \u00c0 20 1C.",
