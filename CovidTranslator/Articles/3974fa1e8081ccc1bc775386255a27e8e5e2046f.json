Particles or pathogens are trapped in the mucus and driven by ciliary action (the ciliary elevator) to the pharynx. Mucociliary trans port declines with age but any effect on clinical infection has not been proved. Lymphoid tissues of the Waldeyer ring (adenoids, palatine and lingual tonsils) are important in developing an immune response to pathogens. However, the best respiratory defence mechanism is the cough reflex, the components of which include cough receptors, affer ent nerves, the cough centre, and efferent nerves and effector muscles. Impairment of any of these -as may be seen in older patients or those with conditions associated with lowered consciousness (e.g. sedative use and neurological disease) -can weaken protection. Dysphagia or impaired oesophageal motility may exacerbate the tendency to aspi rate foreign material. The alveolar defence mechanisms include mac rophages, immunocytes, surfactant, phospholipids, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgE, secretory IgA, complement components and factor B; many immune defects manifest with recurrent respiratory infections.",

In health, about 75% of a normalsized VC is expelled in 1 second (FEV 1 ). The peak flow meter, which measures the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR; the earliest portion of forced expiration), is a simple measure of airflow obstruction, when the FEV 1 is a much smaller fraction of the VC. In lung restriction, the diminished VC can be mostly expelled in about 1 second. Serial meas urements (e.g. in asthma) provide valuable information about disease progress.

Patchy areas of alveolar collapse can result. Emphysema is dilatation of air spaces dis tal to the terminal bronchioles with destruction of alveoli, reducing the alveolar surface area available for respiratory exchange.

In highincome countries, most human TB arises from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, transmitted from person to person through the air. TB usually affects the lungs initially (pulmonary TB) but can also involve brain, kidneys, spine and other parts. From Victorian times to about the Second World War, Mycobacterium bovis infection from infected cows' milk (bovine or bTB) was a major cause of morbidity and mortality; it was clinically and pathologically indistin guishable from infection caused by M. tuberculosis. Cattletesting and a slaughter programme became compulsory in 1950 and, by the 1980s, the incidence of TB in cattle had been substantially reduced. Tuberculosis from M. bovis in cows' milk was virtually eliminated in highincome countries by the tuberculin testing of cattle and pasteurization of milk. In the developing world, many cattle still have TB, and bTB is still seen. bTB has also increased in highincome countries over the last two dec ades and an infection rate of up to 38% in badgers -and transmission to cattle -may explain this.",

Immunocompromised people -such as diabetics and severely immuno deficient patients, like those with HIV/AIDS (about 30% of South Africans with HIV/AIDS also have TB) -and patients in prisons or institutions are at risk. TB also mainly affects medically neglected persons, such as vagrants, alcoholics, intravenous drug abusers or older homeless people. The main groups at increased risk for infection therefore include people who are resourcepoor or immunoincompetent, especially: TB in developing countries is particularly widespread and is increasing, the highest rises in incidence being in SouthEast Asia, subSaharan Africa and Eastern Europe. In highincome countries, the incidence is also rising, probably because of worsening social deprivation, homelessness, immigration, HIV infection and intra venous drug abuse. It is now as common in London as in the devel oping world, and is seen especially in immigrants, such as those from the Indian subcontinent, Africa and South Asia. This increase appears to be a result of the development of TB disease in individu als who may have been infected for some time and of new infections acquired in the UK, or as a result of travel to other countries where TB is common. London accounted for the highest proportion of cases in the UK in 2011 (39%), followed by the West Midlands region (11%); 74% of these were born outside the UK and mainly originated from South Asia and subSaharan Africa.

They result from coughing of infected sputum from pulmonary TB, including in HIVinfected persons with TB, but are rare and such cases (usually middleaged males) may result from neglect of symptoms or default from treatment. Occasionally, the diagnosis is made from biopsy of an ulcer after granulomas are seen microscopically. Acidfast bacilli are rarely seen in oral biopsies, even with the help of special stains, so unfixed material should also be sent for culture if possible. Tuberculous cervical lymphadenopathy is the next most common form of the infection and is particularly com mon among those from South Asia. Most TB lymphadenitis is pain less, with several enlarged, matted nodes, but systemic symptoms are present only in a minority and only about 15% have pulmonary mani festations on radiography (Fig. 15.7) . Diagnosis relies on tuberculin testing, which can be positive in both tuberculous and non tuberculous mycobacterial cervical lymphadenitis. Any person with lymphadenop athy and recent conversion from a negative to positive tuberculin test should be suspected of having mycobacterial infection, and this should prompt biopsy (e.g. fineneedle aspiration biopsy) for culture or histo logical confirmation. PCR will improve diagnosis, as culture must wait 4-8 weeks for a result. Oral complications of antitubercular therapy are rare, but rifabutin and rifampicin can cause red saliva. Pulmonary TB is of high infectivity, as shown by cases of tuber culous infection of extraction sockets and cervical lymphadenitis in 15 patients treated by an infected member of staff at a dental clinic. Dental staff who themselves were HIVpositive, working in a dental clinic for HIVinfected persons in New York, have died from TB con tracted occupationally. Transmission of MDRTB between two dental workers may have occurred in an HIV dental clinic. Infection control is thus important, so staff with TB are usually precluded from their occupation until treated.",

            "text": "Respiratory distress in premature infants may be caused by immaturity of surfactantproducing cells, when the alveoli fail to expand fully; this necessitates endotracheal intubation for many weeks. It may, in turn, result in midface hypoplasia, palatal grooving or clefting, or defects in the primary dentition. The same oral effects may be seen with prolonged use of orogastric feeding tubes. The degree to which subsequent growth corrects these deformations is currently unknown, though the palatal grooves typically regress by the age of 2 years. Using soft endotracheal tubes does not obviate this problem and, at present, the best means of avoiding palatal grooving appears to be the use of an intraoral acrylic plate to stabilize the tube and protect the palate.",
