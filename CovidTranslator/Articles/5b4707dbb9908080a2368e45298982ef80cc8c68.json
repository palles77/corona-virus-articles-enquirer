However, direct 13 transmission of the virus from bats to humans is unlikely due to lack of direct contact, 14 implying the existence of unknown intermediate hosts. Angiotensin converting enzyme 15 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of certain species can be 16 utilized by SARS-CoV-2. Here, we evaluated and ranked the receptor-utilizing 17 capability of ACE2s from various species by phylogenetic clustering and sequence 18 alignment with the currently known ACE2s utilized by SARS-CoV-2. As a result, we 19 predicted that SARS-CoV-2 tends to utilize ACE2s of various mammals, except 20 murines, and some birds, such as pigeon. This prediction may help to screen the 21 intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. 22 23 2 Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); 24 receptor utilization; phylogenetic analysis. 25 26",

Intriguingly, cat, pangolin, cow and goat ACE2s were also clustered with 126 human ACE2. Considering the widespread of stray cats, wildlife markets and stock 127 farms in Wuhan, it was not strange that these animals could serve as potential 128 intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, it was reported in the local news that 129 SARS-CoV-2 was detected in pangolins, though further verification is required. 130",

            "text": "CoV-2 but mouse ACE2 cannot [6]. We aligned the aa sequence of these five ACE2s 135 (File S2). Eleven aa residues distinct in mouse ACE2 but conserved in other ACE2s 136 were identified, which were T20, Y83, S218, A246, K353, P426, T593, N636, A714, 137 R716 and A774. However, according to the complex structure of human ACE2 and the 138 receptor binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein (PDB ID: 6VW1), only 139 three of the eleven sites are located near the interface and potentially mediate the 140 binding, which were T20, Y83 and K353 (Figure 2A) Combining the two screening, we got nine critical aa sites as shown in Figure 2B . 148 Based on these sites, we established a marking system to evaluate the utilizing 149 capability by SARS-CoV-2 of different ACE2s. In the system, the initial score for every 150 ACE2 was 100 and substitution on the critical sites would result in reduction of 50 151 marks (for K31D, Y41A, Y83F, K353H/A/D, D355A and R357A) or 10 marks (for 152 other substitutions). K31T and Y41H would not reduce the scores since these two 153 substitutions exist in civet and Chinese horseshoe bat ACE2s, respectively ( Figure 2B) . 154 A final score less than 0 was adjusted to 0. As the result, a final score equal to or less 155 than 50 means that the ACE2 contains either at least one substitution that will abolish 156 the receptor binding or at least five other substitutions that will make it quite different 157 from human ACE2. Therefore, the ACE2s with final scores higher than 50 were 158 considered to be potentially utilized by SARS-CoV-2, while those with scores less or 159 equal to 50 were unlikely to be utilized by SARS-CoV-2. The final scores for all ACE2s 160 we analysed were listed in Table S1 . As shown in Table 1 , excluding the animals 161 unlikely contacted by people in Wuhan, pangolin, cat, cow, buffalo, goat and sheep 162 ACE2 were ranked as the top mammals that could be potentially used by SARS-CoV-2, 163 while murine ACE2s, such as mouse and rat ACE2s, got the lowest scores. As for birds, 164 pigeon ACE2 reached the highest score of 70 ( Table 1) were unlikely to be utilized by SARS-CoV-2. To verify the robustness of our ranking 172 system, we labelled the utilizing capability of different ACE2s on the phylogenetic tree, 173 and found that the ACE2s confirmed or potential to be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 174 (labelled with circles) were obviously clustered from those unlikely to be utilized by 175 SARS-CoV-2 (labelled with triangles) (Figure 1) . The well matching with the 176 phylogenetic tree elevated the liability of this marking system. 177",

Occasional interspecies 45 transmission of virus is believed to be a major cause of coronavirus epidemic. SARS-46CoV-2 has a high genetic relationship with a bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13) with a 47 96% genomic nucleotide sequence identity. The close phylogenetic relationship to Bat 48RaTG13 provides evidence for a bat origin of SARS-CoV-2 [6]. However, direct 49 transmission of the virus from bats to humans is unlikely due to the lack of direct 50 contact between bats and humans in Wuhan, China. Hence, there are probably 51 intermediate hosts transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans. This speculation is supported 52 by the reports about the intermediate hosts of other human coronaviruses. For instance, 53 SARS-CoV, the coronavirus causing SARS epidemic in 2003, was also originated from 54 bats [7, 8], but it transmitted to human via a variety of intermediate hosts including 55 masked palm civet cats and raccoon dogs [9, 10]. Since native reservoir hosts of viruses 56 usually live far away from human community, intermediate hosts play critical roles in 57 transmitting viruses to human and causing epidemics. A common way to determine the 58 intermediate hosts is to collect all animals in the original epidemic area and detect the 59 virus in them one by one, which is quite time-and labor-consuming and also is easy to 60 be biased by passive contamination of the samples. 61 Receptor recognition is an important factor determining host range and cross-62 species infection of viruses. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been proved 63 to be the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2 [6]. ACE2 was initially identified as an 64 exopeptidase expressed in vascular endothelial cells in the heart and the kidney that 65 catalyses the conversion of angiotensins [11, 12]. Later, ACE2 was well known for its 66 function as the virus receptor of SARS-CoV [13]. Utilization of ACE2 as the receptor 67 by SARS-CoV-2 is an important rationale to classify SARS-CoV-2 to the same 68 subgenus as SARS-CoV. ACE2 is expressed in most vertebrates, but not all ACEs can 69 be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 as the receptor. Currently studies demonstrated that SARS-70 CoV-2 is able to use Chinese horseshoe bats, civet, swine but not mouse ACE2 as its 71 entry receptor [6]. Obviously, the utilizing capability of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 can be 72 used for quick screening to narrow down the range of the intermediate hosts for SARS-73CoV-2. We intended to predict the utilizing capability by SARS-CoV-2 of different 74ACE2s via amino acid (aa) sequence comparison. Unfortunately, the aa identities 75 between human ACE2 and ACE2s of Chinese horseshoe bats, civet, swine and mouse, 76",
