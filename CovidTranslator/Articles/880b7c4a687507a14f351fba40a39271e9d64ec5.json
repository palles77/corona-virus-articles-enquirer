(Summer Snowflake), a threatened Amaryllidaceae plant species in Bulgaria used in the pharmaceutical industry as raw material for production of galanthamine-based medicines. Plants of known origin and with different alkaloid profile were taken from the living collection of the Institute of Botany, Sofia. Bulbs were used to initiate in vitro cultures and 24 clones were multiplied. The influence of the clone origin on the propagation coefficient, shoot and bulblet morphology, alkaloid profile and content of galanthamine, lycorine, and four related alkaloids was evaluated. Clones kept stable alkaloid profiles and for most of them, high regeneration rates were noted. Galanthamine content of some clones was commensurable with that of Bulgarian populations of L. aestivum of commercial importance. Five clones: four galanthamine-type and one lycorine-type were selected as promising for further investigation.",

Galanthamine (Gal) is one of the alkaloids specific for the Amaryllidaceae plants and known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It has been successfully used for treatment of poliomyelitis, post-polio paralysis, myasthenia gravis, facial nerve paralysis, and other neuromuscular disorders, as well as for traumatic brain injuries, and schizophrenia (Paskov 1955; Irwin and Smith 1960) . Furthermore, its commercial application in Alzheimer's disease therapy has been widely adopted (Dal-Bianco et al. 1991; Marco and Carreiras 2006) . Another alkaloid of interest found in several Amaryllidaceae species, lycorine (Lyc), has been studied for its inhibitory activities against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), poliovirus, coxsackie virus, measles virus, and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1; Ieven et al. 1983; Szl\u00e1vik et al. 2004; Li et al. 2005) .",

Subsequent investigations have shown that Leucojum aestivum was a more productive Amaryllidaceae species, as compared to Galanthus nivalis, Galanthus woronowii, and Sternbergia colchiciflora (Bubeva-Ivanova and Daleva 1970) . Furthermore, in a wide survey of numerous Bulgarian natural populations of L. aestivum, Stefanov (1990) observed different alkaloid profiles and galanthamine content ranging from 0.1 to 0.56% DW and suggested the existence of three geographically differentiated chemotypes, with galanthamine, lycorine or lycorenine as main alkaloid. However, exploitation reserves and possible annual harvest have decreased extremely during the period 1960-1990 due to overutilization of the populations and habitat destruction (Stoyanov and Savchev 1964; Mitrev 1995) . Therefore, ex situ strategy for conservation of this species has been developed in Bulgaria, including in vivo and in vitro approaches (Gussev et al. 2003) .",

Identification of eight alkaloids in callus, clumps, and bulblets of L. aestivum by CGS-MS confirmed the capacity of in vitro cultures to produce alkaloids (Berkov et al. 2005) . However, the few investigations of the alkaloid content have revealed absence or low concentrations of galanthamine (Diop et al. 2006; Diop et al. 2007; Georgieva et al. 2007; Pavlov et al. 2007 ). Comparison was done concerning the alkaloid pattern of wild plants from 18 Bulgarian populations and several in vitro obtained shoot-clumps (Georgieva et al. 2007 ). Nevertheless the relation to mother plants features was not previously examined. In vitro cultures of Narcissus confusus and Ungernia victoris were also studied as potential producers of galanthamine (Aleksandrova et al. 1994; Sell\u00e9s et al. 1999) .",

Mother plants were chosen according to their alkaloid profile and content, in a way to cover all three chemotypes of the species described for Bulgaria by Stefanov (1990) . The author suggested that the alkaloid biosynthesis and especially the content of galanthamine depended only on the geographical latitude of populations and the soil characteristics. However, the long-term in vitro cultivation on a medium with unchanged composition, under fixed temperature and illumination regime, has demonstrated that all propagated clones have kept the inherent features of their corresponding plant clusters. Pure Gal-type clones 3.9, 4.45, 5.2 and 5.9 produced only Gal. Their in situ clusters of origin gathered in April 2001 from populations Petkaki, Vesselie, and Arkutino along the Bulgarian Southern Black Sea Coast contained only Gal (unpublished data). Similarly, the mother plant of the most productive Lyc-type clone 9.6 belonged to a cluster taken from the sole Bulgarian Lyctype population Baltata close to the northern Black Sea Coast. Clones 10.4 and 11.3 were established from plants originating from populations along the Danube and they also did not produce Gal. On the other hand, the mixed- type in vitro clones 7.80, 7.26, 7.73, and 7.6, with a common population of origin Kalinata, produced Gal and Lyc in quite different contents and proportions: galanthamine between 0.44 and 1.12 mg/g DW, and lycorine between 0.12 and 2.03 mg/g DW. The alkaloid contents of their corresponding plant clusters on the field plot also varied strongly. This was in accordance with the reported normal distribution of plants concerning their Gal content (from 0.1 to 4 mg/g DW) within one sole population in South Bulgaria (Poulev et al. 1993 ). Significant variation of the Gal content between and within seven Bulgarian populations permitted for industrial use was revealed by Gussev et al. (2007) as well. Georgieva et al. (2007) reported that the alkaloid patterns of 35 dormant bulbs gathered from 18 Bulgarian populations (two bulbs from population) also varied a lot comprising two to twelve alkaloids. All these results referred to genetic determination of the alkaloid biosynthesis that is a precondition for selection of high alkaloid producing clones. Although the populations pertain to three chemotypes according to their major alkaloids it is important to notice that the selection of high Gal producing cultures should be based on clonal level because of the population heterogeneity regarding both the alkaloid pattern and the content of the alkaloids.",

Our analyses demon-strated that during the long-term in vitro cultivation Gal content remained much higher in the leaves then in the bulblets, as it was noted for the organs of the wild plants (Stefanov et al. 1974) . Thus, the average content of Gal in the leaves of in vitro and in vivo cultivated plants of clone 5.2 was similar: 2.15 and 2.18 mg/g DW respectively. Gal richest in vitro clones, were those originating from clusters with high Gal content and either developing long leaves, or remaining with small bulblets.",

These low concentrations of Gal were probably due to the low alkaloid content in the mother plants, or to the processes of dedifferentiation and redifferentiation.",

The rate of proliferation of direct adventitious shoots and their growth to harvestable size does not always stay constant for long periods (Bigot 1981) . The morphogenic potential of L. aestivum cultures was not affected under long-term in vitro cultivation. Three years after cultures initiation, direct shoot proliferation was ever more intensive and from 7.6 to 14.3 shoots and bulblets per explant were obtained in half of the clones. One possible reason for the retained regeneration potential was the suitable balance of the growth regulators in the medium. Popov and Cherkasov (1984) obtained callus and shoots of L. aestivum, G. woronowii, and N. hybridus on media supplemented with BAP, kinetin and NAA in different concentrations and noted that domination of cytokinins limited callus formation. In case of higher auxin concentration, 10 \u03bcM NAA and 0.5 \u03bcM BAP, the organogenesis turned to root formation with 1.5 bulblets and 5.6 roots per primary explant (Diop et al. 2007 ). Another reason for the increased PC was the larger meristem zones of the bulblet sectors consisting of five to eight scales compared to the primary twin-scale explants. The PC of subcultivation of all clones was higher than the PC of L. aestivum in our earlier studies: 2.72 bulblets per explant (Stanilova et al. 1994) ; and in those of some other Amaryllidaceae species: 3.5 and 2.0 bulblets per initial explant for Galanthus nivalis and Galanthus elwesii, respectively (Staikidou et al. 2006) , and three to four adventitious bulblets per twin-scale for Pancratium maritimum (Dragassaki et al. 2003) .",

The high galanthamine concentration of the in vitro clones, commensurable with those of the commercially important wild populations, is a good prerequisite for their use as an alternative alkaloid source. Moreover, clones 5.2, 4.45, and 3.9 originated from Galtype populations Arkutino, Vesselie, and Petkaki that are not permitted for industrial harvest.
