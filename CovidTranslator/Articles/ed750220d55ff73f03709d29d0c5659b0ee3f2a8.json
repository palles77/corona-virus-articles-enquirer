The evaluation for heart transplantation focuses on assessment of the presence of optimal medical management, the stability of extracardiac function, and adequate compliance and caregiver support. Standard immunosuppression after transplantation consists of triple-drug therapy with corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors (most commonly tacrolimus), and antiproliferative agents (most commonly mycophenolate mofetil). Treatment of rejection is progressively more aggressive as the patient's clinical status worsens, and ranges from an oral corticosteroid bolus and taper to intravenous pulse corticosteroids, cytolytic therapy with antithymocyte globulin, intravenous immune globulin, plasmapheresis, and circulatory support with inotropic therapy, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The major long-term complications of heart transplantation are cardiac allograft vasculopathy, infections, and malignancy.",

The 5-year mortality for patients with symptomatic heart failure approaches 50%, and may be as high as 80% at 1 year for the end-stage patients. 1 Over the last 4 decades, cardiac transplantation has become the preferred therapy for select patients with end-stage heart disease. Approximately 2400 heart transplants are performed annually in the United States. According to the registry of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation, the median survival of patients after transplantation is currently 10 years, and up to14 years for those surviving the first year (Fig. 1) , a significant improvement over that of medical therapy for heart failure. 2 The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of heart transplantation in the current era, focusing on the evaluation process for heart transplantation, the physiology of the transplanted heart, immunosuppressive regimens, and early and long-term complications.",

The most common indication for heart transplantation is refractory heart failure.

Intractable ventricular arrhythmias, commonly referred to as \"VT storm,\" may merit heart transplant evaluation, and often urgent listing, given the association with hemodynamic compromise. The relative scarcity of donor organs makes it essential to determine whether patients are truly refractory to maximal medical therapy and require heart transplantation (Fig. 2) .",

The loss of afferent nerve supply means that the recipient will not experience angina. Therefore, chest discomfort in a heart transplant recipient, especially early after transplant, is likely not caused by coronary ischemia, and coronary ischemia will likely not present with chest discomfort. The standard practice of annual angiograms for surveillance of transplant coronary artery disease is a direct consequence of the lack of afferent nerves supplying the transplanted heart. The consequences of the loss of efferent nerves are related to the loss of vagal tone and the postganglionic direct release of norepinephrine stores in response to exercise. With the loss of vagal tone, heart transplant recipients have a higher than normal resting heart rate of around 90 to 110 beats per minute. The lack of efferent nerves also means that the transplant recipient must rely on circulating catecholamines to respond to exercise, so there is a blunting of the heart rate's response to exercise. Similarly, after exercise, the heart rate returns to baseline more slowly because of the gradual decline of circulating catecholamine concentrations to baseline.",

However, despite widespread use, no randomized trials of cytolytic agents as induction therapy have been performed in heart transplant recipients. Retrospective evaluations from a large, multi-institutional database have suggested that cytolytic therapy reduces the risk of early rejection but increases the risk of infection. In a randomized trial of induction therapy with dacluzimab in heart transplant recipients, such recipients had less rejection but an increased risk of death from infection; because of the blinded nature of the study, some patients received both the IL-2R antagonist and cytolytic induction therapy. 7 Based on these results, induction therapy is not standard practice at many centers. Instead such therapy, most often with antithymocyte globulin, may be reserved for those patients at the highest risk for rejection, including patients who are highly sensitized with donor-specific antibodies, or those with significant renal dysfunction in whom delay of calcineurin inhibition is advisable.",

Unlike renal or liver transplantation, there are no laboratory markers for rejection in heart transplantation and, thus, the endomyocardial biopsy is the standard approach for the routine surveillance of rejection. Endomyocardial biopsy is most commonly performed in an outpatient setting via a right internal jugular venous approach under fluoroscopic guidance. The most serious complications (which occur in 0.5% of cases) include tricuspid valve injury and cardiac perforation, which can result in tamponade. 19, 20 Although the timing of biopsies varies from center to center, in general biopsies are performed frequently early after transplantation and less frequently as time goes on. At the authors' center, after year 1, biopsies are performed only if the heart transplant recipient develops symptoms or signs of rejection. The purpose of the endomyocardial biopsy is to assess for myocardial damage in the form of cellular or antibody-mediated rejection. The diagnosis of cellular rejection is made in accordance with the revised International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) grading scale, published in 2005, which simplifies the prior 1990 classification. 21, 22 Biopsies are classified as: Grade 0 R, no rejection (no change from 1990); Grade 1 R, mild rejection (1990 Grades 1A, 1B, and 2); Grade 2 R, moderate rejection (1990 Grade 3A); and Grade 3 R, severe rejection (1990 Grades 3B and 4).

If the patient has no symptoms of heart failure and normal left ventricular ejection fraction, treatment options include oral or intravenous pulse steroids, targeting higher levels of immunosuppressive medications, switching from cyclosporine to tacrolimus, 9, 10 or switching from MMF to a PSI. 14, 15, 29 Given the equivalent success of intravenous and oral corticosteroid therapy for the treatment of asymptomatic cellular rejection, 30 an outpatient course of oral corticosteroids is often the firstline treatment for asymptomatic cellular rejection. Asymptomatic antibody-mediated rejection is more challenging. Recent studies indicate that it may be associated with poor outcomes, 31-33 but it is unclear whether treatment affects outcomes. At the authors' institution such patients will receive an oral corticosteroid bolus, consideration of intravenous immune globulin, and close monitoring of donor-specific HLA antibodies.",

Coronary angiography remains the mainstay of CAV detection, although it has limitations. Coronary angiography relies on the ability to compare normal segments of the vessel with diseased segments. The diffuse nature of CAV often results in underestimation of disease because there is no reference segment whereby the normal diameter of the vessel can be assessed. Comparison with prior studies may help, but requires the use of the same angiographic protocol at each study to avoid confounding by technical factors such as angiographic projections and magnification. Intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) is currently the only technique offering cross-sectional images of the coronary vessel wall comparable with histologic sections (Fig. 7) . Intimal area can be quantitatively assessed to detect even early plaque burden. Sequential images are usually obtained as the catheter is pulled back to determine the extent of the disease along a vessel wall. In several studies, IVUS is more sensitive than angiography in detecting CAV. [50] [51] [52] [53] IVUS also has prognostic value: progression of intimal thickening greater than 0.5 mm in the first year after heart transplantation is associated with an increased risk of death and development of angiographic CAV up to 5 years after transplantation. 42 Nevertheless, IVUS has several limitations: it is highly invasive, requires anticoagulation and the use of expensive single-use catheters, and its evaluation is mainly limited to the major epicardial vessels.

This problem has led to several attempts to investigate monitoring assays, none of which are well validated at present, and there is currently no standard approach to accurately assess the risk for infection in a transplant recipient. However, an immunemonitoring assay (ImmuKnow; Cylex, Columbia, MD) performed on peripheral blood, which measures adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release from activated lymphocytes, may offer some guidance in profoundly immunosuppressed patients. 60, 61 In the largest study to date in heart transplant recipients, the average T-cell immune function (TCIF) score was significantly lower in patients who developed an episode of infection within 1 month after the measurement, compared with steady-state patients. 62 A TCIF score of less than 200 ng ATP/mL was associated with future infection. The authors have used this information to tailor immunosuppression. In a patient with infection, if the TCIF score is less than 200 ng ATP/mL, immunosuppression will be reduced either by decreasing the dose of MMF or by targeting lower drug levels of the calcineurin inhibitor or PSI. If the TCIF score is 200 to 500 ng ATP/mL, the patient has an adequate level of immunosuppression. If the TCIF score is greater than 500 ng ATP/mL, the patient may be under-immunosuppressed and the MMF dose may be increased, or high drug levels of the calcineurin inhibitor or PSI may be targeted.",

However, the most critical point of treatment of malignancies is prevention. The authors encourage all heart transplant recipients at their institution to undergo routine health maintenance screenings with their primary care physicians. In addition, patients are instructed to use sun protection and to establish care with a dermatologist for routine skin examinations. The initial approach to malignancy is reduction of immunosuppression, and switching patients with newly diagnosed malignancy to a PSI such as sirolimus or everolimus instead of a calcineurin inhibitor or MMF, because of the possible protective effect of PSIs in malignancies.

Immunologic mechanisms are shown in blue; immunosuppressive drugs and their site of action are shown in red. Acute rejection begins with recognition of donor antigens that differ from those of recipient by recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (indirect allorecognition). Donor APCs (carried passively in graft) may also be recognized by recipient T cells (direct allorecognition). Alloantigens carried by APCs are recognized by the TCR-CD3 complex on the surface of the T cell. When accompanied by costimulatory signals between APC and T cells such as B7-CD28, T-cell activation occurs, resulting in activation of calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates transcription factor NF-AT, allowing it to enter the nucleus and bind to promoters of interleukin (IL)-2 and other cytokines. IL-2 activates cell surface receptors (IL-2R), stimulating clonal expansion of T cells (T-helper cells). IL-2, along with other cytokines produced by T-helper cells, stimulates expansion of other cells of the immune system. Activation of IL-2R stimulates target of rapamycin (TOR), which regulates translation of mRNAs to proteins that regulate the cell cycle. Sites of action of individual drugs (highlighted in red) demonstrate multiple sites of action of these drugs, underscoring the rationale for combination therapy.
