Th is approach has been successfully applied in research on several lung diseases.

To evaluate more potential confounders, we did a sensitivity analysis with adjustment for all covariates in Table 1 Because SNP rs7766874 was a signifi cant QTL marker of PLT ( Table 4 ) , and was associated with ARDS risk by interacting with PLT ( Table 5 ), PLT may act as an important causal mediator of the genetic effect of LRRC16A on ARDS outcome. To test this hypothesis, we performed a causal inference test using mediation analysis. Based on previously reported studies [31] [32] [33] and considering that our cases were all Berlin moderate or severe ARDS, 30 the ARDS prevalence among the at-risk population was set as 5%; this was in turn used to calculate the weights for mediation analysis. Signifi cant causal indirect eff ect was detected for SNP rs7766874 on the increased risk of ARDS that was mediated through PLT (VanderWeele method, OR Indirect 5 1.045 per eff ect allele; 95% CI, 1.007-1.085; P 5 .021) ( Table 6 ) .

We also performed two sensitivity analyses that excluded the control subjects who could be reclassifi ed as patients with ALI or excluded the ARDS cases who were diagnosed on the day of ICU admission. Consistently significant or borderline signifi cant associations were observed ( Table 6 ). To evaluate the impact of diff erent ARDS prevalence on our results, we set the ARDS prevalence at 10% or 15% for further sensitivity analyses; these results were consistent with that at 5% ARDS prevalence ( Table 6 ).",

Th e SNP rs7766874 showed limited population diversity in the National Center for Biotechnology Information dbSNP database (G allele frequency in African American 5 51%). Interestingly, among ARDS cases and at-risk control subjects, the association was inconsistent. Th e mechanisms for this are not well understood. It is possible that LRRC16A plays a diff erent role in at-risk control subjects vs ARDS cases and needs to be further studied. In this study, we demonstrate strong evidence that a low platelet count contributes to a higher risk of ARDS. A low PLT could be caused by thrombocytopenia or DIC; both are common complications among critically ill patients and are independent risk factors aff ecting prognosis.

Th e indirect hazard eff ect of SNP rs7766874 on ARDS risk may be explained because SNP rs7766874 causes a Regression coeffi cient and its 95% CI, representing the change in PLT per eff ect allele. c q represents adjusted P value by false discovery rate method. P 5 .231, also known as total eff ect in mediation analysis). It is possible to have a signifi cant indirect eff ect in the absence of total eff ect. 38, 39 Th is can be explained by the presence of several mediating paths (multiple potential mediators) that confl ict with each other and become noticeable when one of the cancelling mediators is controlled for. Th us, the indirect eff ect identifi ed in our study is a \"partial\" mediation eff ect. However, this mechanism needs to be better understood through well-controlled experiments. Also the interaction between LRRC16A and PLT implies that LRRC16A has eff ect beyond platelet count but also on function and, in turn, on ARDS risk. Extensive evidence demonstrates a role of platelet function in increased morbidity and mortality among patients in the ICU, [40] [41] [42] [43] whereas the precise mechanism of how the genetic variants impact platelets and in turn aff ect ARDS risk requires further studies of functional genomics.",

Actin-based cellular processes are essential for end-amplifi cation of proplatelet processes during megakaryocyte maturation. 45, 46 Th e intronic SNP rs7766874 may be in linkage disequilibrium with latent functional variants that alter the activity of CARMIL and thereby result in abnormal megakaryocyte matura-tion and altered platelet formation. Interestingly, platelets contain actin-binding proteins that can bind to and shorten actin fi laments. [47] [48] [49] [50] Moreover, F-actin acts as a key step in ARDS induced by systemic infl ammatory response syndrome via increased blood neutrophil adhesion and migration and by the production of infl ammatory factors. 51 An alternative postulated mechanism of LRRC16A on ARDS is platelet independent that the variant LRRC16A prevents actin polymerization , which impacts the alveolar capillary barrier function. 52 We acknowledge some limitations in our study. Th e Illumina ExomeChip includes a high percentage of low-frequent alleles. Our study was limited in power to study the association of these low-frequent functional SNPs with ARDS outcome. Additionally, further investigation is needed to evaluate the mechanisms that underlie the mediation of platelets in the association between LRRC16A genetic variants and risk of ARDS.",
