We also contend with new threats, such as AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Some pathogens cause acute illnesses such as smallpox and cholera but, once survived, pose little additional threat. Other pathogens -for example, those causing malaria, tuberculosis and leprosy, as well as parasitic worms -can be carried as chronic infections and impair nutrition, growth, cognitive development and fertility.

Highthroughput biotechnology enables large-scale surveys of genome diversity, genome-wide association studies (GWASs), next-generation sequencing, and high-throughput experimental and bioengineering approaches17. Together with expanding computational capacity18, these tools offer new power to find and functionally elucidate adaptive changes. Pathogen susceptibility and immune traits are particularly amenable to mapping approaches that combine scans for natural selection and genetic association.

Such data sets have several advantages. They do not suffer from ascertainment bias, which is the distortion in measures of genetic diversity and neutral variation20 created by the nonrandom sampling of SNPs on arrays. In addition, sequence data make it feasible to dissect loci with complex patterns of selection and short blocks of linkage disequilibrium (LD), such as the haemoglobin beta (HBB) gene that is associated with sickle cell anaemia21. Finally, as sequencing can detect potentially all variation throughout an individual's genome, the search for the precise causal variant driving selection is facilitated; however, as for SNP genotyping arrays, the comprehensiveness of capturing population-wide variation will depend on the number of individuals sampled.",

A selected variant that increases rapidly in frequency in the past ~250,000 years can be detected as an unusual reduction in genetic diversity. Recent positive selection (within the past 5,000-100,000 years) can be found with three different signals: unusually large allele frequency differences between populations, unusually high frequency of newly derived variants and unusually extended LD caused by the rapid increase in frequency of a single allele.

A variant may confer a heterozygous advantage; for example, at the HBB sickle cell locus, heterozygous carriers are malaria resistant to a large extent but otherwise healthy, which gives them a reproductive advantage in malaria-endemic environments over homozygous wild-type individuals (who are susceptible to malaria) and homozygous carriers (who have sickle cell disease and high childhood mortality27). Alternatively, the advantage conferred by a variant may depend on its prevalence. Diversifying selection favours high levels of polymorphism, as in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHC diversity confers resistance to a broader range of pathogens44 and is strongly selected for45. In humans, MHC diversity correlates with local pathogen diversity, which is consistent with pathogen-driven balancing selection46. Selection at this locus is of particular interest, as it harbours more bona fide disease associations than any other region in the human genome47, 48, including associations to infectious disease susceptibility (including AIDS49, 50, 51, leprosy52, leishmaniasis53, hepatitis B54, 55, 56, hepatitis C57 and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection58), autoimmune disorders, cancers and neuropsychiatric diseases. regions with signatures of balancing selection -MHC and 125 other loci64 -were enriched for membrane glycoproteins.

Indeed, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we found that variants in positively selected regions in the NIH Catalog of published GWASs are more significantly associated with the tested phenotype (P KS = 2 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ) than those in the rest of the genome33.",

Influenza is almost certainly very old: Hippocrates described a flu-like illness ~2,400 years ago171. Observational data suggest that host genetics influences susceptibility to severe illness172; for example, cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain show strong familial aggregation173. Recently, interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) have been implicated in resistance to influenza A. IFITMs inhibit in vitro replication of some pathogenic viruses174, and IFITM3 expression protects against infection by multiple strains of influenza A in vitro and in vivo175. Hospitalized patients with severe influenza were significantly more likely to carry a splice acceptor site variant in IFITM3 that reduces its ability to restrict influenza virus replication in vitro175.

New research finds that both the most ancient signals of balancing selection (on cell surface glycoproteins) and some of the clearest signals of recent positive selection (on TLRs) implicate pathogens as the strongest selective pressure to drive the evolution of modern humans. Incorporating ancient history into disease susceptibility studies will identify functional variants and elucidate cellular mechanisms, and facilitate the development of new therapies for a surprisingly wide range of human illnesses. The range of diseases affected by ancient pathogen-driven selection extends beyond infectious diseases and immune-mediated disorders. Inflammatory and immunity genes are associated with psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia196 and autism197, and the role of host genetics in maintaining a healthy microbiome is only starting to be examined14. At the dawn of genomic medicine, our ancient evolutionary history is one of our most powerful resources for understanding human biology towards improving human health. a | The variants in a population-wide sample are shown for a schematic genomic locus. The red region indicates a variant that provides selective advantage (such as a host variant that confers relative resistance to an infectious agent). Positive selection of that variant rapidly increases its prevalence in a population and also the prevalence of nearby alleles that are in linkage with it. b | Positive selection on a variant is detectable with three types of signals: high levels of differentiation (that is, when positive selection in one geographical region causes larger frequency differences between populations than those expected for neutrally Karlsson A | A genome-wide scan for signals of positive selection in the Yoruban population of Nigeria found a strongly selected nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that alters the pathogen recognition protein Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) (part Aa) and that is predicted to disrupt TLR5 activation in response to flagellated bacteria33 (part Ab). Cell lines that carry the new TLR5 variant (Leu616Phe) had significantly reduced nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signalling in response to flagellin, which is potentially protective against some bacterial infections (part Ac). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean over at least three independent experiments; P values are indicated above the bar graphs. B | Two For pathogens that predate human dispersal from Africa, ancient and complex signals of selection are shared between human populations, and there are variable implications for genome-wide association studies (GWASs). For widespread pathogens that are more recent, the range of new resistance variants will be more limited, but selection is harder to detect when it is shared between populations. For recent pathogens that affect specific populations, GWASs in the selected populations will be particularly powerful, as causal variants will have been driven to high prevalence. Selection signals from one population may help to detect resistance loci in other unselected populations, but only if resistance variants arise in the same genetic loci. For GWASs of very new diseases, supplementing these studies with methods to detect selection will add no power, unless variants that confer resistance also protect against more ancient pathogens. Examples of pathogens matching each scenario are given on the right. ",

Combining different signals of selection into a composite score can increase resolution by up to 100fold, which facilitates identification of the causal variants. c | Variants that are of high frequency, of strong effects and in regions of extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) -all of which are characteristics of positively selected loci -are detectable with smaller sample sizes in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Even with full sequence data, lowfrequency alleles (solid blue lines) require larger sample sizes (x axis; equal number of cases and controls) than high-frequency alleles (solid red lines) for equivalent power over a range of effect sizes (1.2, 1.5 and 2.0).
