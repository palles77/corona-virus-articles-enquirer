Methods We established an experimental cancer cachexia model by subcutaneously implanting colon 26 cells into the armpits of BALB/c mice. Following administration of MG132 at various time points, body weight, food intake, gastrocnemius muscle weight, spontaneous activity and survival of tumor-bearing mice were examined along with tumor growth. Moreover, cachectic markers including glucose, triglyceride, albumin and total proteins as well as levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-6 in serum and gastrocnemius tissue were measured. Finally, mRNA and protein levels of p65, IjBa, and ubiquitin E3 ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx in gastrocnemius muscle were assessed. Results MG132 treatment significantly alleviated cancer cachexia as demonstrated by attenuated weight loss, altered carbohydrate metabolism and muscle atrophy and increased spontaneous activity and survival time of tumorbearing mice. MG132 reduced tumor growth and the levels of TNF-a and IL-6 in serum and gastrocnemius tissue. NF-jB, MuRF1 and MAFbx were also inhibited by MG132. Unexpectedly, MG132 was more efficient when administrated during the early stages of cachexia. MG132 had no effect on food intake of tumor-bearing mice. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that MG132-induced inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in cancer cachexia decreased the activity of NF-jB and the degradation of IjBa, and reduced the levels of TNF-a and IL-6 in serum and gastrocnemius tissue, accompanied by downregulation of MuRF1 and MAFbx. These data suggest that MG132 is a potential therapeutic and preventive agent for cancer cachexia.",

This multifactorial syndrome is characterized by progressive depletion of skeletal muscle, which is often, but not always, accompanied by loss of body fat (Fearon et al. 2011) . Cachexia-induced muscle wasting and weight loss have a detrimental effect on the patient's quality of life and are the major factors contributing to death (Fearon 2008) . However, there are few therapeutic options available for cancer cachexia, and conventional nutritional support cannot fully reverse these cachectic manifestations (Fearon et al. 2011) .

            "text": "Elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia by mediating systemic inflammation, which in turn promotes the degradation of muscle proteins (Saini et al. 2006) . In response to proinflammatory cytokines, NF-jB, a transcription factor regulating the expression of a number of proinflammatory markers such as cytokines and chemokines, is activated, thus establishing a positive feedback loop that results in overstimulation of NF-jB, fibrosis and degradation of specific muscle proteins (Kumar et al. 2004; Li et al. 2008) . Muscle protein degradation is mediated by the lysosomal system, cytosolic protease and ubiquitinproteasome pathway. Among these mechanisms, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a predominant role and accounts for the majority of skeletal muscle degradation in cancer cachexia (Melstrom et al. 2007 ). The key enzyme in the ubiquitin-proteasome system is E3 ubiquitin ligase. Two E3 ligases, atrogin-1 (MAFbx) and muscle RING finger protein 1(MuRF1), are involved in skeletal muscle atrophy (Gomes et al. 2001; Bodine et al. 2001) . Accumulating data have demonstrated that both MAFbx and MuRF1 are regulated by NF-jB (Judge et al. 2007; Cai et al. 2004; Adams et al. 2008) .",

MG132 is a specific, potent and reversible proteasome inhibitor and blocks the degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated IjB, thereby inhibiting NF-jB activation (Inoue et al. 2009) . It was recently shown that MG132 could reduce immobilization-/disuse-induced skeletal muscle atrophy via inhibiting NF-jB (Caron et al. 2011; Jamart et al. 2011 ). In the present study, we evaluated the potential effect of MG132 in cancer cachexia and found that MG132 ameliorated cancer cachexia by attenuating the activation of the NF-jB pathway.",

To evaluate the effect of MG132, we administered MG132 to the tumor-bearing mice at various stages of cachexia and analyzed changes in body weight. Although there was no apparent difference 5 days postimplantation in terms of body weights, significant difference was noted between mice from the MP and CC groups or the MP and MT groups, starting from day 12 (P \\ 0.5). After 19 days, significant weight loss was observed in mice from CC, MP and MT groups (P \\ 0.5). Moreover, a drastic difference in terms of the carcass weights after excision of tumor burden was noted between MP and CC groups (P \\ 0.001). Interestingly, only slight but not significant difference in body weights were observed between these two groups (1a). Other than body weight, tumor weights and volumes were also recorded for all tumor-bearing mice. As shown in Fig. 1b- Sequence from 5 0 to 3 0 (2013) 139:1105-1115 1107 48.96 % of those of CC mice, respectively. When administrated during advanced cachexia from day 12, MG132 was less effective in alleviating weight loss and inhibiting tumor growth (P \\ 0.001), while the body weights of mice from the MT group remained 17.40 % heavier than those of CC mice. In addition, tumor volumes and weights of the MT group were 48.96 and 61.25 % of those of CC mice, respectively ( Fig. 1b-d) . Besides weight loss, anorexia is another characteristic symptom of cancer cachexia. Consistent with a previous study, no significant differences in food intake were observed between groups (Tanaka et al. 1990 ) (data not shown). These results demonstrated that MG132 ameliorated weight loss and inhibited tumor growth of C26 tumorbearing mice.",

Moreover, gastrocnemius muscle weights (Fig. 2a Right) and cross-sectional areas (Fig. 2b) of CC mice were 52.53 and 51.46 % of those of HC mice, respectively. In contrast, gastrocnemius muscle weights of MP or MT mice were 52.10 or 31.82 % higher than those of CC mice, respectively. Histological analyses further demonstrated that MG132 rescued, at least partially, gastrocnemius muscle atrophy, as the gastrocnemius cross-sectional areas of MP or MT mice were 59.60 or 30.24 % larger than those of CC mice (Fig. 2b) . Moreover, MG132 treatment led to increased spontaneous physical activity and prolonged survival of tumorbearing mice. Compared with HC mice, CC mice exhibited a significant reduction in spontaneous physical activity and total distance was 28.24 % of HCs (Fig. 2c) . In response to MG132 treatment, significant increases in spontaneous physical activity were observed in the MP and MT groups. Furthermore, MG132 treatment beginning at day 5 was more effective in restoring spontaneous physical activity of tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 2c) . We next recorded survival time of tumor-bearing mice and plotted the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The survival time for mice from the MP and MT groups was 9 and 5 days longer than those of CC mice, respectively. However, it seemed that survival time was not correlated with the timing of the first dose of MG132 during the course of cachexia (Fig. 2d) . Thus, MG132 could reverse skeletal muscle atrophy, increase spontaneous physical activity and prolong life span of tumor-bearing mice, particularly during early stages of cancer cachexia.",

Interestingly, elevated levels of triglyceride were observed in CC mice (Fig. 3b) .

To examine whether MG132 exerts its anti-cachexia functions by attenuating the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, we performed ELISA to measure TNF-a and IL-6 levels in serum and gastrocnemius muscles from tumor-bearing mice. As shown in Fig. 4a -d, TNF-a and IL-6 levels in both serum and gastrocnemius tissues were significantly higher in CC mice as compared to HC mice, while the serum levels of TNF-a in MT and MP mice were 49.19 and 20.87 % lower than those of CC mice, respectively. Similarly, IL-6 levels in the serum of MT or MP mice were 51.85 or 41.89 % lower than those of CC mice, respectively ( Fig. 4a-b) . In gastrocnemius muscles from MP or MT mice, TNF-a and IL-6 levels were also significantly reduced, and the effect was more prominent when MG132 was administered during the early stages of cachexia ( Fig. 4c-d) .

In turn, these cytokines serve as potent activators of NF-jB, whose activation plays a critical role in skeletal muscle atrophy (Li et al. 2008; Guttridge et al. 2000) . The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in the degradation of regulatory and structural muscle proteins, such as Blood sampling was performed on day 19 before killing. Serum levels of glucose (a), triglyceride (b), albumin (c) and total protein (d) were measured. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SD (x \u00b1 s). *P \\ 0.05, **P \\ 0.001 when compared with HC mice; #P \\ 0.05, ##P \\ 0.001 when compared with CC mice; $P \\ 0.05 when compared between MP and MT mice myofibrillar proteins. Increased activation of NF-jB leads to skeletal muscle atrophy by enhancing the ubiquitinproteasome proteolytic pathway (Cai et al. 2004; Cao et al. 2005) . Recent data showed that MG132 reduces skeletal muscle atrophy by inhibiting NF-jB activation (Caron et al. 2011; Jamart et al. 2011) . These data led us to hypothesize that MG132 ameliorates cachexia by preventing skeletal muscle atrophy through regulation of NF-jB-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome proteolysis. We examined the expression of IjBa, p65, MuRF1 and MA-Fbx in the gastrocnemius muscles of tumor-bearing mice using real-time PCR and western immunoblot. Dramatic reductions in mRNA of IjBa were observed in CC mice as compared to those of the HC group (Fig. 5a) , while mRNA levels of p65, MAFbx and MuRF1 were significantly increased in tumor-bearing CC mice (Fig. 5b-d) . MG132 elevated the mRNA of IjBa, at the same time attenuating mRNA levels of p65, MAFbx and MuRF1. Moreover, these effects were more evident in mice receiving the first dose of MG132 during the early course of cachexia ( Fig. 5a-d) . Similar protein patterns were also observed ( Fig. 6a-d) .

Though a number of pharmacotherapeutic agents with various mechanisms of action are currently being evaluated, there are currently no drugs approved for the prevention and treatment of cancer cachexia. Regarding its critical roles in muscle atrophy, targeting NF-jB pathway is a promising strategy. A study with curcumin demonstrated that inhibiting NF-jB signaling resulted in muscle regeneration in mice (Thaloor et al. 1999) . Direct targeting of NF-jB DNA binding sites by intratumoral injection of oligonucleotides inhibited cachexia in a mouse model (Kawamura et al. Fig. 4 MG132 treatment reduces the elevated levels of TNF-a and IL-6 in tumorbearing mice. a TNF-a and b IL-6 levels in serum were evaluated by ELISA. c TNF-a and d IL-6 levels in gastrocnemius muscles were measured using ELISA. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (x \u00b1 s). *P \\ 0.05, **P \\ 0.001 when compared with HC mice; #P \\ 0.05, ##P \\ 0.001 when compared with CC mice; $P \\ 0.05, $$P \\ 0.001 when compared between MP and MT mice 1999). Moreover, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, the principal polyphenolic component in green tea, was shown to regulate NF-jB and attenuate skeletal muscle atrophy in cancer cachexia (Wang et al. 2011) . It is known that proteasome inhibitors could block the activation of NF-jB through stabilization of the phosphorylated IjBa. Therefore, we speculated that proteasome inhibitors might ameliorate cancer cachexia by inhibiting the NF-jB pathway. To test this hypothesis, we established a cancer cachexia mouse model that was treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, at various time points during cachexia. We found that MG132 could effectively reverse skeletal muscle atrophy and inhibit tumor growth, accompanied by downregulation of the NF-jB/ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.",

            "text": "MG132 is a potent and reversible proteasome inhibitor whose clinical implications have been studied extensively. For instance, MG132 together with the immunosuppressant, celastrol, improved sialidosis (O'Leary and Igdoura 2012). In severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), MG132 effectively inhibited the replication of SARS coronavirus (Schneider et al. 2012 ). Moreover, MG132 was shown to alleviate liver injury induced by intestinal ischemia in rats (Jing et al. 2012) and was able to suppress cytomegalovirus-specific immune responses (Wang et al. 2011) . Recently, the therapeutic potential of MG132 for cancer treatment has been evaluated. Regardless of cancer type, MG132 is a promising anti-cancer agent functioning by inhibiting tumor cell growth and inducing cancer cell apoptosis (Guo 2012; Sung et al. 2012; Zanotto-Filho et al. 2012; Lombardo et al. 2012 ). In the present study, we showed that skeletal muscle atrophy induced by cachexia was significantly reversed with MG132 treatment. Our results are consistent with previous studies which showed that MG132 prevented muscle dystrophy (Winder et al. 2011) , disuse-induced atrophy (Caron et al. 2011 ) and immobilization-mediated skeletal muscle atrophy (Jamart et al. 2011) . By ameliorating skeletal muscle atrophy and reducing tumor burden, MG132 treatment led to reduced weight loss, improved spontaneous activity and longer survival time in tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that MG132 is a potential therapeutic agent for cancer cachexia treatment. Moreover, administration of MG132 during the early stages of cancer cachexia was more effective in alleviating cachectic manifestations, supporting the observation that preventative interventions in the management of cancer cachexia are important (Fearon et al. 2011) .",

Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SD (x \u00b1 s). *P \\ 0.05, **P \\ 0.001 when compared with HC mice; #P \\ 0.05, ##P \\ 0.001 when compared with CC mice; $P \\ 0.05 when compared between MP and MT mice regulating muscle mass and protein degradation during cachexia (Carson and Baltgalvis 2010; Pajak et al. 2008) . We observed in the current study that elevated serum and gastrocnemius muscle levels of TNF-a and IL-6 were correlated with enhanced muscle wasting and weight loss during cachexia, whereas administration of MG132 led to significant reductions in TNF-a and IL-6 in serum and gastrocnemius muscle, accompanied by alleviated cancer cachexia manifestations. Previous studies have demonstrated that MG132 could reduce pain and inflammation through inhibiting NF-jB signaling (Ahmed et al. 2010) . Our data indicated that the anti-cachexia effect of MG132 was also mediated by suppressing the NF-jB pathway. An elevated expression of IjBa and reduced levels of p65 in gastrocnemius muscle were observed in mice receiving MG132 treatment. In agreement with a previous study which showed that inhibiting the expression of MuRF1 and MAFbx could reverse skeletal muscle atrophy and muscle protein degradation (Glass 2010) , we showed that MG132 significantly reduced MuRF1 and MAFbx. Moreover, western immunoblot with protein extracted from tumor tissue revealed that MG132 could impede tumor growth by targeting NF-jB pathway, like what has been observed in Zanotto-Filho et al.'s study (Zanotto-Filho et al. 2012 ). However, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway seems not to contribute to the anticancer effect of MG132 as the expression of MAFbx and MuRF1 was not affected. Therefore, MG132 may attenuate cancer cachexia by blocking activation of NF-jB and hence upregulation of TNF-a and IL-6, inhibiting the downstream ubiquitin-proteasome pathways such as MuRF1 and Western immunoblot analyses were performed to detect the effect of MG132 on protein levels of IjBa (a), p65 (b), MuRF1 (c) and MAFbx (d) in gastrocnemius muscles.
