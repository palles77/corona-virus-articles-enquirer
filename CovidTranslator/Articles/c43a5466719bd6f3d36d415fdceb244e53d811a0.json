            "text": "Influenza A virus is the most significant worldwide respiratory pathogen, infecting a range of species that includes humans, pigs, horses, sea mammals and birds. 1 Influenza viruses are divided into different subtypes based on the antigenic reactivity of their two surface glycoproteins, the haemagglutinin and the neuraminidase. So far, 16 different haemagglutinin (H1-H16) and nine neuraminidase (N1-N9) subtypes have been identified among all influenza A viruses. 2 Waterfowl, shorebirds and gulls are considered the natural hosts of all influenza subtypes, from which mammalian influenza viruses are directly or indirectly derived. 1, 3 Influenza infection in humans and pigs is primarily restricted to the upper and lower respiratory tract with viral replication occurring in the epithelial cells present on the surface of the respiratory mucosa. 4 The acute phase of infection is characterized by a multifocal destruction of the epithelium with cellular desquamation to the luminal space, which may often lead to patches along the mucosa with few or no epithelial cells over the basement membrane. It is also associated with the presence of oedema, vascular congestion, hyperaemia and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the submucosa underlying the epithelial layer. 4, 5 The presence of both N-acetylneuraminic acid-a2,3-galactose (Neu-Aca2,3Gal) and NeuAca2,6Gal receptors in the pig respiratory tract makes this species susceptible to most human and avian influenza viruses. 6, 7 For this reason, pigs have been proposed as a 'mixing-vessel' for reassortment between human and avian viruses. 3, [6] [7] [8] The significance of cross-species transmission of swine influenza viruses to humans is underscored by the recent human influenza outbreak with an H1N1 of possible swine origin. 9, 10 In addition to being important natural hosts, pigs constitute a valuable animal model for the study of influenza infection, 5, 11 as virus may be transmitted experimentally to in-contact animals and they can exhibit clinical signs, histopathology and cytokine expression profiles comparable to influenza infection in other species. [3] [4] [5] 11, 12 In vivo studies have provided valuable information on clinical course, viral pathogenesis, innate and acquired immune responses, vaccine efficacy and antiviral treatment. 4, 5, [13] [14] [15] However, such studies are greatly affected by animal welfare considerations and logistical constraints. To overcome such constrains, in vitro systems that involve either established or primary cell lines have been widely used, 16, 17 but such systems usually lack the natural physiological context present in the respiratory mucosa, such as cell polarization, coordinated ciliary activity, mucus production and apical contact with air.",

[18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] Such systems reproduce, to a great extent, the physiological conditions and the cellular complexity of the respiratory mucosa of the host in a highly controlled setting. The three-dimensional structure and cell diversity of the respiratory mucosa is preserved together with important physiological features like normal expression levels of cell receptors, effective mucus production and ciliary activity. 18, 23, 27 Moreover, EVOC systems allow a quantitative analysis of the effects of pharmacological agents (i.e. antiviral drugs) and \u2044 or the host innate response on infection dynamics. 23, 27, 31 In addition, tissue collected from a single animal can be used in numerous replicas, which reduces the experimental variability and the number of animals used, following the principles of (reduction, replacement and refinement (3Rs) in animal experimentation. 32 In this study, we developed a swine tracheal EVOC system for the study of influenza virus infection. Swine tracheal explants infected with a contemporary avian-like swine H1N1 virus supported productive infection and exhibited histopathological changes consistent with in vivo influenza infection. Overall, this system constitutes a useful physiologically relevant model for the study of influenza infection in a scalable, well-defined and controlled experimental setting.",

Whole tracheas were aseptically collected and transported in pre-warmed culture medium consisting of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with penicillin (100 U \u2044 ml; Sigma), streptomycin (50 lg \u2044 ml; Sigma, Dorset, UK), l-glutamine (10 mm; Sigma) and amphotericin (2AE5 lg \u2044 ml; Sigma). Once in the laboratory, tracheas were kept at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 -95% air mixture in a humidified incubator. Four to six washes were performed, over a period of 3 hours, by immersing the tissue in fresh, warm DMEM \u2044 RPMI medium. The presence of bacterial flora was evaluated by inoculation of the final washing medium in Brain Heart Infusion Broth (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) with further incubation at 37\u00b0C for 72 hours.",

A high dose (2AE5 \u00b7 10 6 pfu) was initially used to attempt to ensure viral infection of the majority of susceptible cells. Mock-infected pieces displayed normal histological appearance as described above ( Figure 4A ,C). Infected explants ( Figure 4B ,D) exhibited histopathological changes compatible with in vivo influenza infection, 4,36 including loss of cilia at the apical surface, shrinking and vacuolization of epithelial cells with signs of destruction and desquamation and the presence of cellular debris in the mucus of the epithelial surface. Furthermore, a significant difference in the thickness of the epithelial layer between mock and virus-infected was observed (P < 0AE0001) with a marked reduction at day 1 post-infection (pi) (Figure 4E ). Ciliary-mediated bead clearance was reduced 24 hours pi and completely absent at day 5 ( Figure 4F ). Viral antigen was detected in infected explants by immunohistochemistry. The distribution of positive cells was relatively widespread throughout the whole section and was limited to the epithelial layer ( Figure 5A ). Positive staining was predominantly seen in the nucleus, but with some also in the cytoplasm ( Figure 5B ). Viral antigen was also detected between the cilia and in aggregates of mucosal material present at the surface of the epithelium. In subsequent infections with a lower dose of virus (2AE5 \u00b7 10 2 pfu) the pattern of cells with positive staining remained evenly distributed across the tissue section (Figure 5C,D) .",

            "text": "We have established an ex vivo air interface tracheal organ culture for the study of influenza viruses which could also be used to study other respiratory pathogens. EVOC systems have been developed previously for the study of respiratory pathogens using human, swine, bovine, canine and horse respiratory tissue. 18, 20, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30 The experimental value of the tracheal explants described here is illustrated by the preservation of good levels of both histological and functional features for seven consecutive days, and by showing productive infection with an avian-like swine H1N1 virus. A vast body of knowledge in influenza biology has been generated using diverse experimental systems, each possessing advantages and disadvantages. In vivo studies have provided valuable data on influenza pathogenesis, although detailed information about quantitative infection dynamics and the host innate immune response is still scarce. 1, [3] [4] [5] 15, 37, 38 For respiratory pathogens in particular, samples are usually collected by nasal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage, which may not fully reflect the tissue-specific bacterial and viral infection dynamics occurring throughout the respiratory tract, making it difficult to dissect regional tissue-specific effects from generalized systemic responses. Cell culture systems, using epithelial cells from the respiratory mucosa, may lack key physiological features such as cell polarization, reliable expression levels of cellular surface receptors or the intricate relationships between the different cell types present in the respiratory tract. 39 Primary cell cultures are difficult to establish, possess an inadequate distribution of the different cell types and become altered after a limited number of passages. Established continuous cell lines are by definition aberrant and usually belong to a cell type different to the natural target cells and, in some cases, are derived from a species different from the natural host. Ex vivo organ cultures provide an alternative solution. Nasal mucosa 27 and tracheal explants 39 immersed in cell culture medium have been used previously for the study of influenza infection. However, using this technique cells are subjected to submersion-related stress and to a continuous source of infecting pathogen as the inoculum remains in the cell culture medium. 22 The tracheal organ culture described here exhibits several advantages compared with submerged organ cultures, cell cultures or in vivo studies. First, in an air interface system the explants are exposed basolaterally to culture medium and the apical cell surface is exposed to the air. The threedimensional structure of the tissue as well as the interactions among cells is preserved. In particular, the cells of the epithelial lining of the trachea maintain the same morphological appearance, differentiation and polarity as described in the living host. In contrast to submerged systems, once explants are inoculated, re-infection from the culture medium or other components of the system is rare. The absence of a blood supply constitutes a weakness of the air interface EVOC system as recruitment of cells of the immune system to the infection site is abrogated. However, such a potential pitfall might be turned to advantage and used to dissect the effects of innate and intrinsic immunity. 40 In this study, the overall histology of the explants was preserved for 7 days with no significant differences in the thickness of the uninfected epithelium. This is consistent with previous reports of similar systems in which explants of respiratory tissue from different species have been maintained for variable periods of time, ranging from 60 hours to 5 days. 23, 25, 27 Mucus production provides an important nonspecific defence against viral infections. 41, 42 During the initial washing steps in setting up the explants, a majority of the mucus is removed from the epithelial surface. However, mucus is produced de novo by goblet cells throughout the duration of the organ culture, and thus the physiological conditions present in the living host are maintained in this regard.",

For beads to be cleared from the surface of the organ culture piece, individual cilia must beat in a coordinated manner across the epithelial surface with mucus acting as a vehicle to transport unwanted particles away from where the alveoli would have been in a wave-like motion towards where the larynx would have been. 43 By using the bead clearance assay, we were able to distinguish between small patches of ciliary movement and truly coordinated ciliary activity, an important measure of the robustness of the system. The increase in the clearance time observed at later time points in uninfected explants may be associated with changes in pH, or energy limitations of the tissue. Although the supplemented culture medium contains most of the essential components required for survival of the explants, it may not constitute a complete substitute for the nutrients available from the living host.",

With an intermediate dose, a single peak occurred at day 3 pi, whereas the lowest infection dose resulted in detectable virus at day 2 pi, followed by a subsequent rise in copy number at later time points. Such Influenza infection in a pig tracheal EVOC system \u00aa 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses, 4, 7-15 distinct patterns might be related to differential levels of innate immune response, as well as to the initial number of susceptible target cells. A large inoculum would be expected to infect most of the susceptible cells and viral replication may also trigger a massive innate immune response, resulting in a small number of susceptible cells available for a second round of viral replication. Once the antiviral signalling molecules are depleted, the remaining infectious particles can infect the susceptible cells, and this would be consistent with the second rise in virus titres observed at day 5 ( Figure 5F ). Although a second round of infection could not be ruled out, the peaks are too separated in time for this to be likely. A smaller dose of virus might trigger a milder innate immune response, restricted to neighbouring cells, allowing the virus to infect a larger number of cells over multiple rounds of infection. Accordingly, the kinetics of infection with the lowest viral dose displayed a marked shift to the right because more replication cycles were required to infect all or most of the susceptible cells. Further experiments that incorporate the quantification of cytokine expression will help to test this hypothesis.",
