Aim: To document the incidence of RTI in adults hospitalized with acute asthma. Methods: A prospective study of patients with acute asthma admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Western Hospital Footscray, over a 12-month period. A control group was studied from elective surgical inpatients. Patients were investigated with serologic tests for Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Legionella, and influenza A and B. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were cultured for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, and herpes simplex virus. If sputum was available, it was assessed with microscopy and culture. Blood cultures were taken if patients were febrile and all patients had a chest radiograph. Control subjects completed serologic tests and NP A. Results: Seventy-nine patients (33 male and 46 female) and 54 control subjects (26 male and 28 female) were studied. Two patients were enrolled twice. Mean (\u00b1SD) age of patients was 35\u00b115 years (range, 16 to 66 years), and mean age of control subjects was 37\u00b115 years (range, 18 to 69 years). In the patient group, 29 (37%) had evidence of recent RTI of which 23 were viral. Five of the control subjects (9%) had evidence of recent RTI (p<0.001). Twenty-four patients were positive on serologic and/or NP A culture. Five patients had positive serologic test results and/or NP A culture to two or more agents. Two patients tested positive on sputum, radiograph, and temperature criteria. Three patients tested positive on the basis of radiographic evidence of consolidation, blood neutrophilia, and temperature. Influenza A (13) and rhinovirus (9) were the most common infectious agents. Other agents identified were RSV (one), influenza B (two), adenovirus (one), and Mycoplasma (one). Influenza and rhinovirus infections occurred predominantly in late and early winter, respectively. Summer hospitalization did not relate to RTI. Conclusion: Thirty-seven percent of adult patients with acute asthma admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine over a 12-month period had evidence of recent RTI. (CHEST 1997; 112:591-96) ",

We chose to recruit only patients admitted to the respiratory medical unit because the patients admitted with asthma to other medical units also had evidence of other major medical illnesses that may have confounded our results. The 49 patients admitted to the respiratory medical unit and not recruited to trial were missed predominantly because of logistic reasons rather than refusal to enter the study. The major reasons for asthma patient nonrecruitment to the trial was admission to hospital over weekends and a 2-week period in April1994 when the physicians conducting the trial were on leave.

Twenty-three patients (29%) had evidence of recent viral infection, predominantly influenza A and rhinoviruses, on serologic and/or NPA culture criteria ( Table 2) . Thirteen of the patients had evidence of recent influenza A infection, two had evidence of recent influenza B infection, and nine had evidence of recent rhinovirus infection. Five of the patients had evidence of more than one viral infection ( Table 2 ). There was a peak of influenza in the late winter and early spring period whereas rhinovirus infection occurred predominantly in early winter. Three patients with either DISCUSSION We have found evidence of recent RTI in 37% of adult patients admitted to hospital to the respiratory medical unit over a 12-month period with acute exacerbation of asthma. This is in contrast to early previous studies in which 10 to 21% of adult asthmatics have been found to have RTI present at time of acute exacerbations. 15 Indeed, Tarlo et al 1 6 in 1979 did not find an association between RTI and asthma exacerbation in adults. It has long been postulated that many asthma exacerbations are precipitated by RTI. In children it has been shown that asthma exacerbation is associated with respiratory tract infection in up to 45% of cases, though RTI is present in between 50% and 60% of asthmatic children studied without asthma exacerbation. 5 In the same study, 24% of children hospitalized with asthma had evidence of recent viral infection. Horn et alP however, found 50% of children with acute asthma exacerbation had evidence of rhinovirus infection in sputum. The higher rate of RTI in children with asthma exacerbation compared with adults has been thought to be partly due to the delayed presentation of adults for management and the more rapid clearing of viruses which often occurs in adults, leading to increased difficulty in isolation of viruses in adults. .. Older studies had difficulty in isolating rhinovirus and coronavirus infection and although we tried to culture for coronaviruses on NPA, we did not find infection with this organism, perhaps because of its fastidious nature. Our study has identified only one patient with evidence of recent Mycoplasma infection. As Mycoplasma infections occur in epidemics, this suggests that little Mycoplasma had occurred in the community during the patient recruitment period. We found that 11% of our patients had rhinovirus cultured from NPA and by combining NPA culture and viral serology, we also found an incidence of 19% influenza A or B infection in our patients. Our results for viral RTI associated with acute asthma exacerbation are lower than those of Nicholson et al 9 who prospectively studied 138 adult outpatient asthmatics. They found an incidence of 44% of nonbacterial pathogens in what they termed severe asthma episodes (mean decrease of PEFR > 100 Umin). They also found that 24% of laboratory-confirmed RTI were associated with mean decrease of PEFR :::::50 Umin on days 1 to 7. These authors were also able to identify coronavirus infections by a noncommercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique and rhinoviruses by seminested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. 9 In a prospective study, Beasley e t al 8 assessed recent RTI in acute asthma exacerbations in adults in an outpatient setting. Though overall they found evidence of RTI in only 10% of acute asthma exacerbations, they state that the incidence of viral RTI with severe asthma exacerbation was 36%. The authors, however, did not specify the criteria for severity of asthma. They further found that 60% of those adult asthma patients who had evidence of RTI also had an exacerbation of asthma of varying severity. 8 To our knowledge, our study is only the second prospective work assessing the association of recent RTI in adults with acute asthma requiring hospitalization. Abramson et al, 18 in a case-control study of 38 patients older than 10 years admitted to hospital with acute asthma, found that 21% had evidence of recent viral RTI. The asthmatic group had 6.2 times more chance of having viral RTI than a control group. 18 Our study has a larger number of patients and we specifically assessed patients older than 18 years.",

Because our control subjects were recruited simultaneously with the patients and were age-and sexmatched, there were some difficulties with recruiting over the entire 12-month period; however, it was clear that the rate of RTI within the control group was lower than the asthmatic patients. Our control subjects, however, were a selected group admitted to the hospital for elective surgery and our finding of 9% incidence of recent RTI may be an underestimation for the general community. Although we do not have incidence figures of RTI agents in the community during the time frame of our study, we have an indication of these pathogens in the community from data collected by VIDRL (N. Lehmann; personal communication; 1995).1 9 These data are taken from serologic, NP A, and sputum samples sent to the reference laboratory, from patients who are ill with RTI. Overall during winter, RSV was the predominant pathogen as it was in spring and the influenza viruses were common in early spring. Viral infections were uncommon in summer with adenoviruses and parainfluenza viruses being predominant, and during autumn, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and parainfluenza viruses were common. From these figures, there did not seem to be an influenza or Mycoplasma outbreak in the community during the 12 months of our study (N. Lehmann; personal communication; 1995). 1 9 Indeed RSV, adenoviruses, and parainfluenza were noted frequently in the VIDRL data, but they were infrequently associated with asthma exacerbations in our study. The reasons for this are unclear; perhaps the latter infections occurred predominantly in children and/or are less likely to cause increase in bronchial reactivity in adults compared with the influenza viruses. 20 Data regarding pollen counts during the year in Melbourne show that 81% of total grass pollens per annum occur in November and December and tree pollens, mainly elm and cypress, predominate in late winter and early spring. 21 Taken together, these data suggest that in late winter and early spring, the population is exposed to a number of RTI pathogens and tree pollens that could potentially cause asthma. Whereas in summer, though RTI pathogens are less evident, grass pollens are abundant and in autumn and early winter, RTI pathogens are again common in the community. Our hospital admission rates for adult patients with acute asthma show that 55% of the patients were admitted in the five months August 1993 to December 1993 inclusive, whereas in the four months January 1994 to April 1994 inclusive, 20% of the year total number of patients were admitted (Fig 1) . It is therefore tempting to suggest that in our group of patients, the worst times for acute exacerbation of asthma are in late winter, all of spring, and early summer and are related to high levels of community RTI pathogens and high environmental pollen counts.",

In addition, we were unable to specifically culture for Chlamydia pneurrwniae (strain TW AR) infection, an organism that has previously been implicated in asthma exacerbations. 22 Further studies in adults with acute exacerbation of asthma using the polymerase chain reaction technique for viral identification may identify a higher incidence of RTI in adult subjects. 23 \u2022 24 It is possible that we may have overestimated the frequency of RTI in our patients by using the criteria of chest radiograph consolidation in association with fever and blood neutrophilia as being diagnostic of infection. However, these criteria are used in routine clinical practice to diagnose pneumonia, and in studies of etiology of hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia, an infective organism is not identified in at least 30% of cases. 25 Similarly the isolation of an organism in the sputum is likely to be pathogenic in the setting of associated sputum neutrophilia and fever with or without chest radiograph abnormalities. Alternatively, we may have underestimated the number of patients with bacterial RTI because of antibiotic therapy prior to their admission to hospital. We do not have reliable data to confirm or deny this possibility, though most of the patients in the study denied recent antibiotic therapy.",

One could postulate that the fever could be secondary to the inflammatory process of asthma alone. However, perhaps not surprisingly, in our population the find-ing of a fever was more common in those asthmatics with evidence of recent RTI compared to those without. Those patients with evidence of recent RTI but who were afebrile on admission to hospital may have exhibited ongoing increased bronchial reactivity secondary to an RTI that had occurred within the 4 weeks prior to hospitalization. There is evidence from both animal and human experimentation to support the concept that viral RTI cause ongoing bronchial inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity.26\u00b727 In addition, as previously stated, adult asthma patients may present to hospital late in the disease severity, so that even if there is evidence of recent RTI, the patients may be afebrile at time of hospitalization.",
