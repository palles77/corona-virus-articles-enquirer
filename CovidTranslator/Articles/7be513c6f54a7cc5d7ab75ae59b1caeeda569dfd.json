Indeed, hospital effluent was and (still) is generally considered of the same pollutant nature as UWW and thus it is commonly discharged in public sewage systems, conveyed to an urban WWTP where it is subjected to conventional treatment, often consisting in primary clarification, activated sludge process and sometimes disinfection. This practice is very common although recent studies (Verlicchi et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2013; McArdell et al., 2011) highlighted that higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals (PhCs), disinfectants and X-ray contrast media occur in hospital effluent as well as a microbiological load exhibiting a higher resistance to treatment (Chitnis et al., 2004) .",

Unfortunately, these WWTPs are not adequate enough to reach high removal efficiencies for the wide spectrum of micropollutants (PhCs, adsorbable organic compounds commonly known with the acronym AOXs) commonly present in hospital effluent. They are also among the main sources of antibiotic release into the environment and thus they may promote the selection of antibiotic resistant genes (ARG) and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), as deeply investigated in Rizzo et al. (2013) . Moreover, in some circumstances, conventional treatments have been adopted for HWW, but they are not well managed and very low efficiencies are achieved even for common parameters, namely BOD 5 , COD, TSS and total coliform (Mesdaghinia et al., 2009 ). Sometimes, a simple primary treatment is adopted for hospital effluent (primary clarification, prechlorination) but it is not efficient (Martins et al., 2008) .",

Their distribution in the different countries in the world can be found in the graphical abstract, as well as on a larger scale in Fig Most of the investigations referred to pilot/lab scale plants (69%) and the remaining 31% to full scale dedicated facilities (see Table SD -1 in the Supplementary data). The latter include the following treatment trains: septic tank followed by an anaerobic filter (Brazil, de Almeida et al., 2013; Martins et al., 2008) ; UASB + anaerobic filters (Brazil, Prado et al., 2011) ; series of maturation and facultative ponds (Ethiopia, Beyene and Redaie, 2011) ; septic tank + constructed wetlands (H-SSF + V-SSF beds) (Nepal, Shrestha et al., 2001) ; MBR (in Germany, Beier et al., 2011 Beier et al., , 2012 in China: Liu et al., 2010; Wen et al., 2004) ; CAS + chlorination (in Greece, Kosma et al., 2010; in Brazil, Prado et al., 2011; in Iran, Mahvi et al., 2009) Moreover, 53% of the studies were carried out in European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Switzerland and Turkey), 27% in Asiatic countries (China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Nepal, Republic of Korea, Thailand and Taiwan), 16% in South America (Brazil) and 4% in Africa (Egypt and Ethiopia). PhCs were detected and removal efficiencies were evaluated in 60% of the studies included, whereas the remaining ones only refer to conventional parameters. All the studies developed in Europe investigated PhCs with the only exception of Nardi et al. (1995) (referring to prechlorination of raw hospital effluent), and Arslan et al. (2014) regarding AOPs applied on a raw HWW. It is worth noting that often in Asian countries, the main reason for investigating hospital effluent treatment is the need to guarantee \"safe\" treatment for this kind of wastewater and to evaluate the possibility of directly reusing the treated effluent due to water scarcity for various requirements, in particular for irrigation (Al-Hashimia et al., 2013) . As discussed below, although it is highly appreciable that this problem has been tackled, their common conclusion, based on an analysis of conventional contaminants whereby a secondary biological treatment followed by chlorination may be considered adequate treatment even in case of direct reuse, is not backed up by comprehensive research into micropollutants or ecotoxicology.",

Another option to improve biodegradability is achieved using photo-Fenton processes (see Supplementary data for the main reactions involved). It was found that in hospital effluent of average pollutant strength (COD 1350-2250 mg/L, BOD 5 /COD 0.30) with a dosage ratio COD:H 2 O 2 :Fe +2 equal to 1:4:0.1, a reaction pH of 3 and a reaction time of 2 h, the removal efficiencies for BOD 5 , COD and TOC were: 61%, 77% and 52% and the BOD 5 /COD ratio increased from 0.30 to 0.52. It was also found that for higher COD values, optimum reaction conditions have to be tested to guarantee good mineralization of organic compounds and to enhance biodegradability (Kajitvichyanukul and Suntronvipart, 2006) . The increased biodegradability of the wastewater was also confirmed by batch experiments on raw and pretreated effluent subjected to a biological process using activated sludge. It was found that in the case of pretreated wastewater, the removal of COD amounted to 90% after a 72 h treatment time, whereas it was only 30% in the case of raw hospital effluent (Kajitvichyanukul and Suntronvipart, 2006) .",

Long SRT values promote adaptation of different kinds of microorganisms and the presence of slower growing species which could have a greater capacity for removing more recalcitrant compounds while simultaneously improving suspended solid separation (Kreuzinger et al., 2004) . Based on data shown in Figs. 2 and 3 observed at different sludge ages, it emerges that an SRT equal to 20-25 d promotes the removal of atenolol and clarithromycin, slightly higher values (around 30 d) enhance diclofenac and erythromycin removal and around 50 d a larger number of compounds are better removed: naproxen, lidocaine, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and cyclophosphamide. Very good removal efficiencies of over 90% were in general observed at a SRT greater than 30 d for many of the selected compounds.",

In the first 75 d, it worked under \"usual\" conditions. Then, HDPE support media were added to the biological reactor (specific area: 600 m 2 /m 3 ; diameter: 12.2 mm; length: 12 mm, density: 0.95-0.98 kg/m 3 ) promoting the development of a hybrid (attached and suspended) biomass and a longer SRT of fixed organisms. In the modified bioreactor, higher removal efficiencies were observed for soluble COD (91.8% vs. 86.9%), TSS (100% vs. 99.6%) and VSS (93.2% vs. 87.9%) and removal efficiencies greater than 95% for codeine, pravastatin, ketoprofen, diclofenac, roxithromycin, gemfibrozil and iohexol, whereas in the unmodified MBR their removal was either absent or very low. The presence of biofilm supports also enhanced particle sorption and improved effluent quality, thus offering better protection of the membranes against fouling and reducing cleaning operations.",

Very good removal efficiencies were observed for analgesics and antiinflammatory drugs after 1 d and complete removal of most was observed after 8 d, with the only exception of salicylic acid and dexamethasone. Although antibiotics were partially removed and required longer times (5 d against 1 d for analgesics), the fungal treatment achieved better results than conventional activated sludge (CAS) processes (Verlicchi et al., 2012a,b) for the most part. This is the case of ciprofloxacin (69% and 99% in sterile and non-sterile conditions respectively, vs. 58-78% in CAS) and clarithromycin (80% in non-sterile conditions vs. 46-62% in CAS).

As for diclofenac, complete removal was observed. This is an important result as it is one of the most persistent compounds in CAS and also a potential candidate for regulation by European legislation. On the other hand, a disadvantage of this process is that after treatment, pH neutralization is necessary as secretion of organic acids by the fungus lowers the overall pH.",

Alkaline pH values promote the removal of metoprolol and propranolol, whereas acidic values enhance the removal of organic load (expressed as COD).

However, no suitable prediction model has been developed up to now as the rejection of the different micropollutants in NF/RO processes is specific for each membrane (Siegrest and Joss, 2012) .",

In addition, chlorination seems to be able to remove diclofenac: in the study by Nielsen et al.

As a consequence, a high excess of disinfectant is generally applied to guarantee a (rough) disinfection of the hospital effluent, but inevitably extremely high concentrations of residual chloride (as high as 100-130 mg/L) will occur, resulting in serious pollution problems to the receiving aquatic environment, as remarked by Emmanuel et al.

As an example, the effluent produced by the very large laboratory for blood analysis in Pievesestina (Cesena, North Italy, effluent flow-rate about 10 3 m 3 /year) is subjected to ozonation and filtration through activated carbon prior to being immitted into the public sewage system and is then co-treated at the municipal WWTP. Alternatively, the addition of 10 mg/L of ClO 2 and a contact time of 30 min guarantee an efficient removal of faecal and total coliforms, with a negligible increment of AOX (Nardi et al., 1995) . This increment is consistent if the applied disinfectant is NaClO (Emmanuel et al., 2004) .",

For example, it emerged from previous discussion of collected removal data of PhCs that activated carbon seems a promising technology in reducing their occurrence in the final effluent. But activated carbon requires expensive maintenance operations in order to guarantee proper performance. In this context, investment cost for an activated carbon filter is lower than that of another AOP treatment, but if DOC levels in the stream fed to the carbon filter are above 10 mg/L, carbon treatment could become uncompetitive against AOPs, due to frequent change out, regeneration and disposal of the exhausted carbon. Moreover, GAC and PAC do not destroy microcontaminants, but they allow their transfer from a liquid phase to a solid one. Operational costs should also include costs of final disposal of GAC and PAC.",
