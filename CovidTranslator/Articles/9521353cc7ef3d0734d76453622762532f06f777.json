            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) was first recognized in England in 1971 as an enteric disease affecting feeder and fattening pigs with less of an effect on suckling pigs (Wood, 1977) . Initially, it was this characteristic that distinguished it from transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE). As the disease spread throughout Europe, acute outbreaks of diarrhea began to be observed in pigs of all ages. In 1978, it was determined that this new type of epidemic viral diarrhea in pigs was caused by a coronavirus (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980) . This new coronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), along with TGE virus (TGEV) have been classified into group 1 of the genus Alphacoronavirus (Song and Park, 2012) . Porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreaks were to 27 or more states (Stevenson et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014;  www.aasv.org/pedv/PEDv_weekly_report_140319. pdf, accessed March 24, 2014). The initial USA PEDV strain from April 2013 has been shown to phylogenetically cluster within subgroup IIa along with a strain/lineage that was detected in China in 2012 (Huang et al., 2013; Stevenson et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014) . A second PEDV strain, described by Iowa State University (www.vetmed.iastate. edu/sites/default/files/vdpam/Disease_ Topics/Swine-Corona-Viruses2-27-14_0.pdf, accessed March 7, 2014) and the Ohio Department of Agriculture (Wang et al., 2014) , was subsequently detected in late 2013/early 2014. Based on the full-length spike (S) protein gene, this PEDV strain clusters with another Chinese lineage from 2010 to 2012 and is distantly related to the PEDV strains that were initially detected in the USA, suggesting that multiple introductions, or a single introduction of multiple strains, of this virus have occurred.",

An epidemiological investigation of the Ontario PED cases pointed to feed as a common risk factor. As a result, several lots of feed and spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) that was imported from the USA and used as a feed supplement were tested for the presence of PEDV genetic material. Several of these tested positive, supporting the possibility that contaminated feed may have been responsible for the introduction of PEDV into Canada (CFIA News Release, 2014; OMAF, 2014; D. Ojkic and G. Maxie, personal communication) . This epidemiological link initiated bioassay trials to determine whether the SDPP supplement or the feed itself contained sufficient infectious PEDV to infect weaned piglets under controlled laboratory conditions.",

            "text": "Nucleic acid extraction Several nucleic acid extraction methods were employed depending on the sample matrix. All extractions included known positive and negative samples as well as a water negative control. For intestinal swab specimens taken at postmortem and placed in virus transport medium, 500-ll samples were extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy \u00e2 Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Mississauga, ON, Canada) following the manufacturer's instructions. This extraction method was used on the initial confirmatory submission received from the Animal Health Laboratory, Guelph. For rectal swab specimens taken from bioassay pigs and placed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 50-ll samples were extracted using the Mag-MAX TM -96 Viral Isolation Kit (Life Technologies, Burlington, ON, Canada) and a MagMAX TM Express-96 instrument. This high-throughput extraction method was used to deal with the large number of samples that were generated during the bioassay experiment. For pelleted feed and SDPP samples, 10% (wt/vol) emulsions were first prepared in sterile PBS and then vortexed thoroughly until fully suspended/dissolved. Three different methods were then evaluated for RNA extraction: (i) MagMAX TM -96 Viral Isolation Kit, (ii) Qiagen RNeasy \u00e2 Mini Kit and (iii) Tri-Pure Isolation Reagent (Roche Diagnostic Corporation, Indianapolis, IN, USA) . For the MagMAX TM -96 method, total RNA was extracted from 50 ll of the unclarified 10% emulsion and eluted in 20 ll of nuclease-free elution buffer. For the Qiagen RNeasy \u00e2 Mini Kit method, the 10% emulsion was clarified by brief centrifugation and total RNA was extracted from 500 ll of the clarified supernatant and eluted in 50 ll of nuclease-free water. For the Tripure method, 100 ll of unclarified emulsion was added to 900 ll of Tripure Isolation Reagent and vortexed thoroughly. Two-hundred microlitres of chloroform was then added, the mixture vortexed thoroughly for~30 s and incubated for 10 min. The aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation and the aqueous phase added to an equal volume of isopropanol. The RNA precipitate was then pelleted, and the pellet dried and dissolved in 20 ll of nuclease-free water. In an attempt to better determine the state of PEDV in SDPP, a protocol using detergent treatment and differential centrifugation prior to MagMAX TM extraction was used. Ten grams of SDPP was prepared as a 10% (wt/vol) suspension in PBS with or without 0.25% (vol/vol) Nonidet P-40 (Roche), a non-ionic, non-denaturing detergent. The suspension was first centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C and the resulting supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 100 000 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants and pellets collected following both the 10 000 and 100 000 g centrifugation steps were then used for MagMax extraction.",

Twenty-one grams of ground feed or SDPP was added to 210 ml PBS, mixed thoroughly and then divided into four aliquots of 50 ml for each piglet. The remaining 10 ml was stored at \u00c070\u00b0C. Animals received 25 ml of a feed or SDPP suspension via gastric tube while under light isoflurane anaesthesia and the remaining 25 ml orally after recovering from anaesthesia. Three SDPP and two feed samples were tested with four piglets per sample as well as a positive and a negative control group. Positive control animals received 50 ml (25 ml by gastric tube + 25 ml orally) of an intestinal tissue suspension positive for PEDV. Specifically, 2.0 ml of a 10% (wt/vol) tissue suspension of colonic tissue derived from the first-confirmed PEDV case in Ontario was diluted further in 500 ml PBS to give a final tissue dilution of 1 : 2500. Negative control pigs received 50 ml PBS (25 ml by gastric tube + 25 ml orally).

As an added precaution, the positive control inoculum from the PEDV positive intestinal tissue was prepared last. At 7 days post-inoculation (dpi), the 10 negative control piglets were moved and allowed to co-mingle with the positive control (three contacts), SDPP (three contacts) and feed (four contacts) inoculated animals to assess transmission. Piglets were observed daily for clinical signs, in particular vomiting or diarrhea, with the plan to euthanize any severely affected or moribund animals. Rectal temperatures and swabs were taken daily from all animals. At 7 dpi, one piglet each from the positive control and the three SDPP inoculation groups were euthanized, postmortem examinations performed and various samples collected.

This herd had a history of sudden onset of diarrhea in piglets less than a week of age and based on laboratory test results a diagnosis of PED was made (manuscript accepted for publication). Briefly, intestinal swab specimens were tested for the presence of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and PEDV by a real-time RT-PCR assay with all four swab samples producing strong positive results (C t s = 20.47, 21.85, 22.92 and 25.96) on the PEDV N gene rRT-PCR assay. Samples were forwarded to the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD) in Winnipeg where the diagnosis of PEDV was confirmed by PEDV N and S gene conventional RT-PCR assays and sequencing. Based on partial sequence information for the N and S genes, the Ontario PEDV isolate was found to be 99.8% identical to PEDV isolated in the USA in 2013. An additional 10 cases that followed the Ontario index case were submitted by AHL, Guelph to NCFAD, Winnipeg for confirmation. All were confirmed by PEDV N and S gene conventional RT-PCR assays with one of the submissions yielding a virus isolate. An epidemiologic investigation carried out on the index and 10 subsequent cases by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food (OMAF) indicated feed as a common risk factor (CFIA News Release, 2014; OMAF, 2014; D. Ojkic and G. Maxie, personal communication). This led AHL Guelph to test lots of SDPP that were imported from the USA and the associated feed in which they were used as an additive for PEDV nucleic acid by rRT-PCR assay. Several of these gave positive results including the lot mentioned below (data not shown).",

Seven amplicons from the SDPP-inoculated piglets (piglets 21, 22, 25, 26, 29, 30 and 32) at 3 dpi, the weakly visible amplicon from feed-inoculated piglet 35, and spurious bands from the remaining seven feed-inoculated piglets were gel-purified and sequenced.

The sequence from feed-inoculated piglet 35 was also PEDV but of poor quality and difficult to analyse. The seven spurious amplicons selected for sequencing were unrelated to PEDV (e.g. Thermoplasmatales archeon and Candidatus methonomethylophilus using BLAST). The weak amplicon from piglet 35 was cloned and of the 8 clones sequenced, one had a typical PEDV sequence (188/ 188 to PEDV strain USA/Indiana/17846/2013 GenBank accession no. KF452323) similar to those from the SDPPinoculated piglets, indicating that the 3 dpi rectal swab from piglet 35 contained PEDV RNA/virus, albeit at trace levels. Sequence results are summarized in Fig. 2 . The sequences are identical with the exception of a singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at nucleotide 20 961 (the S gene maps from nucleotide 20 634 to 24 794 of the PEDV genome). Individual sequences were found to have a C, a T or both at this site, consistent with a mixed population as indicated by some of the plasma-inoculated piglets.

The procedure used to produce this feed supplement involves collecting blood from healthy pigs at the abattoir into tanks containing an anticoagulant. The pooled blood is then shipped to a processing facility where the cells and plasma are separated by centrifugation. Following centrifugation, the liquid plasma, which is approximately 7% crude protein, is concentrated by evaporation, nano-filtration or ultra-filtration which results in crude protein levels that are in the 20-25% range. This material is then spray-dried to achieve a final crude protein concentration of at least 80%. Studies have shown that the addition of SDPP to weaner pig diets can result in positive benefits including increased feed intake and weight gain and decreased requirement for antibiotics (reviewed by Ferreira et al., 2009) . Although blood from apparently healthy animals can be assumed to be sterile, the risk for virus contamination exists if blood from subclinically affected and viremic animals is collected or if the product becomes contaminated during any step of the process. Viremia is not a known feature of PEDV infection. Blood collected at 7 dpi from three SDPP and one positive control piglet tested negative on the N gene rRT-PCR assay, as did 1 of the positive control piglets at 12 dpi, and three of the positive control group contact piglets at 5 days postcontact.",

Virus isolation was not used as a measure of virus excretion due to the inherent difficulties associated with cell culture isolation of this virus from clinical material. To illustrate this point, Chen et al. (2014) have recently reported that of 33 fecal samples and 17 intestinal homogenates, only 2 PEDV isolates were obtained giving a success rate of only 4%. Moreover, none of the virus isolation attempts that they carried out on feces were successful. Consequently, virus isolation for determination of PEDV infectivity from clinical material is not viewed as a sensitive method. The duration of PEDV shedding in experimentally infected 14-day-old piglets as determined by quantitative RT-PCR was previously reported to be 7 to 9 days (Song et al., 2006) . The quantitative RT-PCR used in that study targeted the S gene of PEDV generating a 651-bp amplicon. A two-step RT-PCR was employed in which the reverse transcription step was carried out separately to produce cDNA. Each cDNA sample was then competed with 10 000 copies of an internal control DNA during the PCR reaction as a means of quan-titating the amount of PEDV RNA present in the sample. In the study reported here, several piglets in the positive control and SDPP groups shed virus well beyond 9 days post-inoculation, with two animals in the positive control group and one animal in the SDPP group still producing positive fecal swab samples at 18 dpi and still capable of transmitting to some of the contact piglets that were introduced at 7 dpi. The longer duration of PEDV shedding in our study could potentially be attributed to a greater sensitivity of the N gene rRT-PCR assay or to a more prolonged infection, perhaps caused by a lower initial infectious dose. Regardless, more work needs to be performed in this area as an accurate assessment of the duration of shedding will have practical applications with respect to control of this disease.",

The mild clinical signs observed in this study may be related to piglet age at the time of inoculation. Using a field strain of PEDV to inoculate specific pathogen-free pigs between the ages of 2 days and 12 weeks, Shibata et al. (2000) reported that severe clinical disease and death only occurred in 2-7-day-old piglets. While rectal swabs from the negative controls and the feed-inoculated piglets remained negative throughout the study, the positive controls and the SDPP-inoculated piglets began shedding significant amounts of PEDV beginning at 1 and 2 dpi. Although negative by N gene rRT-PCR, a single piglet (piglet 35) from the feed-inoculated group had a weak band in the conventional S gene RT-PCR at day 3 and sequencing of this product was consistent with PEDV although, similar to what was found for the feed sample, too weak for accurate determination. However, cloning of the PCR product and subsequent sequencing revealed that it was similar to the other PEDV sequences obtained in this study as well as to those associated with Canadian and initial USA field cases. Electron microscopy of feces and intestinal content and immunohistochemistry on intestinal tissues of SDPPinoculated and positive control piglets were consistent with coronavirus-like particles and the presence of PEDV antigen in enterocytes, respectively. Furthermore, at least one piglet from the SDPP-inoculated group examined at 7 dpi had an obvious enteropathy macroscopically and blunted small intestinal villi microscopically consistent with PEDV infection. Finally, seroconversion of animals in the positive control and SDPP-inoculated groups towards the end of the study provides further support of an active PEDV infection.",

One study (Patterson et al., 2010) found that PCV-2 could be transmitted to na\u20ac \u0131ve pigs given PCV-2-contaminated SDPP by oral gavage. By contrast, the other two studies (Pujols et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2011) showed that weaned pigs that were fed PCV-2-contaminated SDPP neither developed clinical signs, became viremic or seroconverted. All three studies differed with respect to the health status of the animals used, the pooling of plasma from numerous animals, the PCV-2 DNA load and the presence of anti-PCV-2 antibodies, all of which could contribute to the differences in the reported results.",

This was supported by S gene RT-PCR results and sequences and by seroconversion. Moreover, the infection spread to 2 of 3 contact piglets introduced at day 7. The 12 piglets in the SDPP group were inoculated with three samples from different pallets of the same lot number in groups of 4 piglets. The kinetics of PCR positivity did not appear to differ among these piglets indicating that all three samples may likely have contained infectivity. However, as the piglets were kept together in the same room, we cannot unequivocally determine that all three samples were infective but can state that at least one of the three samples contained infectivity and that the results indicate that all 3 may likely have done so.",

Thus, as the tested feed did contain the SDPP shown to be infectious and did contain PEDV genetic material and, moreover, could be detected in a single inoculated piglet at 3 dpi, we consider the tested feed as inconclusive or not possible to determine whether it is infectious or not by bioassay. The one feed that did produce a borderline result in a single piglet (feed sample 1) was subjected to a separate, second bioassay. Although this bioassay included a larger number of piglets (n = 32), infectivity of the feed was not demonstrated. Nevertheless, contaminated feed cannot and should not be ruled out as a potential source of infection as it is very possible that the limited bioassay studies described here are likely much less sensitive than what might occur under field conditions. Many more piglets than used in this study coupled with larger amounts of feed, more stressful field conditions and ongoing infections may influence susceptibility of animals to PEDV-contaminated feed. Lastly, the feeds in question only contain 6% SDPP and, furthermore, had been in use for several weeks in the field prior to their evaluation in our bioassay experiments which, although stored under warehouse conditions, may have resulted in a further loss of any potential minimal infectivity present initially.",
