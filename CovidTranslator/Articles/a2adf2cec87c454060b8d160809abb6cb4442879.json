            "text": "In this present investigation, 2-imino-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)ethane sulphonic acid was anchored on a silver nanoparticle mediated by sugarcane sap. The Schiff base was synthesized from 2-aminoethanesulphonic acid and 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde under lemon juice catalyzed conditions while the nanoparticles were obtained by careful stirring of sugarcane sap and 1 mM AgNO 3 in the ratio of 1:10 respectively at room temperature. The resulting nanocomplex was formed by gentle heating and stirring of the silver nanoparticles solution and the ligand at a temperature of about 80 \u2022 C for 3 h. The ligand, nanoparticles and nanocomplex were characterized using UV-vis spectrophotometer, scanning electron microscope, FT-IR and XRD machines. From the UV-vis results, surface plasmon bands (SPBs) were observed at 475 nm for the nanoparticle within 1 h of the reaction and 450 nm for the nanocomplex. The ligand exhibited absorption bands at 310 nm, 280 nm and 230 nm which are due toelectron transitions within the chromophores. The strikingly broad nature of the SPBs especially in the nanoparticles revealed that the particles are kinetically favored, nucleate easily and are polydispersed and the blue shift observed in the nanocomplex suggested further reduction in the particle size therefore giving us a clue on how to tailor the products by tuning the raw materials. From the scanning electron micrographs, the morphologies and growth mechanisms revealed oriented attachment for the nanoparticles onwards digestive ripening for the nanocomplex. All the synthesized materials proved to be potential antibacterial agents as they showed great inhibition to the growth of some bacterial strains with the activity enhanced in the nanocomplex.

Nanostructures are the matter of interest for all applications of Nanotechnology wherein shape and size of the nanoparticles (NPs) determine their characteristic properties. Due to the growing demand for various nanoparticles, it is necessary to develop synthetic routes that are cost-effective and environment-friendly. The majority of the existing procedures used for nanoparticle synthesis rely upon physical and chemical methods which could introduce toxic and hazardous materials into the system (Ai, Biazar, & Jafarpour, 2011; Mukherjee, Roy, & Mandal, 2008) shape of nanoparticles cannot be met with the physico-chemical methods. Thus, biological methods involving microorganisms or plant extracts have shown to be more effective but in this recent research, there is a drift from the already known biological substrates to a new option which is plant sap. The integration of the principles of green chemistry to nanotechnology as regards to size manipulation of the nanoparticles is an unprecedented technique (Maryam, Niloofar, Ahmad, Fatemeh, & Sassan, 2012) .",

Apart from capitalizing on the antimicrobial potentials of the nanoform of silver, the focus upon the green methods of synthesis is of primary interest so as to counter the physiological and environmental peril associated with the use of chemicals for the fabrication and use of silver nanomaterials (Geoprincy, Vidhya Srii, Poonguzhali, Gandhi, & Renganathan, 2013) . Synthesis of green silver nanoparticles using plant extracts is a very simple and cost-effective way that satisfies the demand of the research community and simultaneously eliminates the possibility of environmental hazards; the plant sap seems to offer better opportunities though the results of this research will guide us appropriately. Our major aim therefore is to biologically synthesis silver nanoparticles using sugarcane juice while anchoring it with a Schiff base ligand.",

            "text": "Ag + ions to Ag atoms. The exact mechanism of the extracellular biosynthesis of metal nanoparticle is not well understood. However, two possible mechanisms have been hypothesized. These are; hydrogen abstraction, due to the OH groups in the sucrose molecules and redox reaction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) coenzyme which works as an electron shuttle to neutralize Ag + ion (Labrenz et al., 2000; Roh et al., 2001; Swarnalatha, Christina, Shruti, & Payas, 2012) . For the formation of silver nanoparticles, the sample changed its visual appearance within 1 h after addition of the extract, indicating that a reduction reaction took place. Initially, the reacting mixture was slightly brownish liquid; as the reaction proceeded, the solution became deep wine-red showing the strong absorption of visible light due to excitation of the nanoparticle surface plasmons (Amendola, Bakr, & Stellacd, 2010; Ericka et al., 2012; Hartland, 2011; Kwon, Lee, Wark, & Lee, 2012; Ray, 2010) . Figure 2b shows that the SPBs was formed within 1 h and stabilized even after the 5th hour of sampling. The sugarcane extract did not give bands within the range of 400-500 nm which is a clear evidence that it is not nanoparticles. The surface plasmon absorption in the nanoparticles is due to the collective oscillation of the free conduction band electrons which is excited by the incident electromagnetic radiation. This type of resonance is seen when the wavelength of the incident light far exceeds the particle diameter (Naika et al., 2015) . The nature of the broad band shows that the nanoparticles are polydisperse and have greater distribution of particle size (Hale, Maddox, Shapter, & Voelcker, 2005) . Moreover, the constant nature of the bands in the subsequent reaction times proves the stable nature of the nanoparticles formed thereby reassuring the substrate as a good bio-reducing and stabilizing agent.",

The absence of spikes above 3300 cm \u22121 in Figure 3a show that the primary amine has formed an imine in the ligand and cannot be absorbed within that frequency range (Wade, 2006) . The weak absorption around 3442 cm \u22121 could be attributed to some water molecules. The strong absorption peaks at 2939 and 2841 cm \u22121 for the ligand and 2357 cm \u22121 for the nanocomplex indicates the C H stretching vibrations. The imine (C N) functional group absorbed strongly at 1679 cm \u22121 for the ligand and at 1678 cm \u22121 for the nanocomplex. The presence of the benzene ring conjugated to imine group in both the ligand and nanocomplex were noticed at 1589 and 1590 cm \u22121 respectively (Okoli, Adewuyi, Zhang, Diagboya, & Guo, 2014) . The striking feature of SO 3 H group was shown by the absorptions at 1259 cm \u22121 and 1256 cm \u22121 for the ligand and nanocomplex respectively. The C O stretching vibrations which is characteristic of ether groups were observed at 1018, 1135 cm \u22121 for the ligand and 1025, 1133 cm \u22121 for the nanocomplex. The strong absorption at 360 cm \u22121 in the nanocomplex which is absent in the Schiff base ligand is a strong indication of presence of silver metal. Figure 3b which shows the spectra of the silver nanoparticles has weak absorptions at 3386 cm \u22121 which indicates O H molecules. The other absorptions at 1650 cm \u22121 and 1041 cm \u22121 are attributed to C O bonds probably due to glucose molecules while the band at 386 cm \u22121 represents the silver metal (Morrison & Boyd, 2002) .",

The introduction of the organic ligand which has unstable surface adsorption property could be destroyed or desorbed in the hydrothermal medium. Evidently, the appearance of the small spherical particles in the nanocomplex indicates that the mass transportation was incessant. There was further crystallization which extended inwards at the expense of the ligand nutrients creating large interior space and surface area (Greer, 2014) . This could equally be supported by the UV-vis spectra shown in Figure 2a and c where there was a blue shift from 475 nm in the nanoparticles to 450 nm in the nanocomplex. It would be expected that the Ostwald ripening should have set in since the ligand molecules may not be able to penetrate into the core region of the nanosystems but based on the evidence from the results, digestive ripening which is the inverse of Ostwald ripening could be suggested as the growth mechanisms (Greer, 2014) . The process of formation is controlled by the surface energy of the particle within solution where the larger particles redissolve and the smaller ones grow (Nguyen, Maclean, & Mahiddine, 2014) . Moreso, the diffusion of the ligands along the surface of the nanosystems could have changed the shape of the particle. This situation occurs under specific conditions where the energy of the ligands within the solution is probably low, forming a gap between the shell and the core particle (Yanjun et al., 2012) .",

Moreover, this experimental result is in consonance with the theoretical as well as other experimental studies which suggest that growth of nanoparticles can be greatly influenced by surface reactions thereby proceeding from a diffusion controlled mechanism onwards to oriented attachment (Dare et al., 2015) . It could be suggested that the surface adsorption of the capping organic molecules (such as sucrose) present in the sugarcane sap, which was not involved in bioreduction could have been purely responsible for the exclusive OA growth as shown in Scheme 2. According to Penn, OA mechanism is due to the degree of electrostatic interactions such as the Vander waal forces which consequently determines the kinetic rate constant (Penn & Banfield, 2004) . While Ribeiro, Lee, Longo, and Leite, 2005 , considers the diffusion and coagulation of the colloids thereby suggesting that the viscosity of the medium played a significant role in the OA mechanism, which is governed by an inverse proportional relationship with respect to the rate constant. In the above-mentioned models, only primary particles are assumed to combine to give secondary particles and the reaction stops; but experimentally, the OA mechanism has proven that growth behavior can go beyond collision and reaction of molecules. The nanocrystals may be capped with easily destroyed and desorbed organic ligands with the coalescence of some multilevel particle being neglected. This mechanism can be likened to the classical Smoluchowski equation which is a limiting case of aggregation that involves monomer-monomer and monomer-multimer reactions neglecting the multimer-multimer reactions.",

The polydisperse nanocrystal lattices emanating from the initial sugarcane mediated system was modified upon refluxing with ligand molecules leading to digestive ripening and nucleating the colloid at the phase boundary (Yijun, Deepa, Christopher, & Kenneth, 2013) . Unlike the well-known Ostwald ripening in which large particles grow at the expense of small particles, this process narrows the distribution by sharing material among different sizes of particles until a thermodynamically stable size segregation can further select the specific particle size (Lin, Sorensen, & Klabunde, 2000) . Many works have been reported on the stabilization of nanoparticles suggesting that control may be due to thermodynamics other than the kinetics of nucleation and crystal growth (Chikan & Kelley, 2002) . In this work, the nanoparticle size resulted from a combination of the ligand-silver binding energy and the surface free energy of the particles to reach the minimum energy of the whole system. The ligand-silver binding energy favors smaller particles with larger surface areas, while the surface free energy favors larger particles with smaller surface curvature. Therefore, these two effects oppose each other and led to a minimum energy with a thermodynamically favored size for each silver-ligand colloid system.",

Nano-silver inside bacterial cells disrupts the biochemical processes by binding with DNA molecules which leads to disordering of the helical structure by crosslinking within and between the nucleic acid strands (Kim, Cho, Ryu, & Choi, 2000) . Indirect effects through changes in the surrounding charge environment also have an impact on the effectiveness of nanoparticulate metals against microorganisms (Stohs & Bagchi, 1995) . Moreover, the silver released from the nanoparticles get attached to the negatively charged bacterial cell wall, rupturing it thereby leading to protein denaturation and finally causes cell death (Sondi & Sondi, 2004) .

The formation of the nanocomplex, the ligand and the silver nanoparticles were analyzed using UV-vis spectrophotometer, FTIR, XRD and SEM. The ligand introduced digestive ripening on the nanoparticles framework thereby establishing stable spherical structures with high surface area and mechanical strength. The ligand with typical imine sulphonic acid group act as useful capping and stabilizing agent for silver nanoparticles while the refluxing close to the boiling point of water effected good digestive ripening. The antibacterial activities results shows that the nanocomplex has enhanced antibacterial properties on E. coli, S. aureus and S. aubeus than its parents Schiff base and nanoparticles. The greater efficacy of the nanocomplex is positively modified upon coordination of the ligand with the nano-silver metal. The established structure in this research therefore acts as self sacrificial templates to fabricate other structural nanosystems with enhanced functionalities. There is scarce information on the synthesis of silver nanocomplex. The results of this study have furnished us with some information but we need more analysis and further research to establish the unfolding success believed to be associated with this emerging bionanoparticulate inorganic system.",
