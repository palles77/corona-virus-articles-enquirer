It will be assumed that de novo synthesis of these molecules by the various fibroblast types discussed proceeds by procedures already established. In the case of the glycolipids, the sugars are added stepwise to a preformed ceramide base through the action of specific glycosyl transferases (cf. R o s e m a n , 1970). T h e protein of glycoproteins is synthesized on polyribosomes and there, upon completion, accepts the first sugar residue. O n c e again carbohydrate residues are added sequentially by specific sugar-transferring enzymes, as the glycoprotein is transported through the Golgi apparatus to its site at the cell periphery (cf. Schachter and Roden, 1973) . O u r own studies on the synthesis of surface glycoprotein by mouse fibroblasts are in accord with the general aspects of the latter model, since treatment of cells with puromycin or cycloheximide brings rapid inhibition of formation of peptide and oligosaccharide moieties .",

Such a conclusion derives from the following observations: (i) Infectious nucleic acid, isolated from highly purified virus, brings about transformation both in vivo and in vitro (Ito, 1962; cf. Crawford, 1969; cf. Sambrook, 1972 ; G r a h a m and van der E b , 1973). (ii) Infection and transformation by these viruses is sensitive to high energy irradiation and mutagenic chemicals (cf. Sachs, 1967; E d d y , 1969; Sambrook, 1972; Vogt, 1972) . Because the capacity for viral replication is more sensitive to these damaging agents than is the ability to transform cells, it seems likely that information for the latter function resides only in a segment of viral genome, (iii) Recently a correlation has been established between the nucleic acid composition of various isolates of R S V and their capacity to replicate and/or transform host cells (cf. D u e s b e r g and Vogt, 1973) . (iv) Some of the surface alterations characteristic of transformed cells are expressed early in cells infected productively or abortively, by oncogenic virus (Ben-Bassat et ai, 1970; H \u00e4 y r y and Girardi and Defendi, 1970 ; H a k o m o r i et al., cf.

Vogt, 1972) , and murine leukemic-sarcoma virus (cf.

It became increasingly difficult to account for the very large number of changes observed in association with virus transformation with the available genetic repository. This is particularly so in the case of the smaller papilloma and papovaviruses [and even adenoviruses (see Tables II and III) ], with genome molecular weights of 2 to 5 x 10 6 daltons.

T h u s , treatment of cells with this e n z y m e (see Fig. 2 ) was shown to release surface glycoprotein from the extreme periphery of cells. This left the underlying plasma m e m b r a n e intact, as indicated by the fact that the plating efficiency of treated cells was unaltered, as was their uptake of nonvital stains (cf. O n o d e r a and Sheinin and Onodera, 1970) . Figure 3 illustrates the operational definition employed for surface glycoprotein. It relies on the fact that 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (as well as most other animal cells), when grown to confluence, are in a pseudo-G-1 phase of growth. If subcultured with trypsin, and plated at subconfluent concentrations, they will grow synchronously and immediately regenerate their surface glycoprotein. If such cultures are incubated with radioactive G l c N H 2 at 12-13 hours post-plating, this precursor is preferentially incorporated into surface glycoprotein. Such specifically labeled surface glycoprotein can be isolated, purified, and characterized (cf.

It is no longer necessary to try to force agreement from different cell types (at various stages of differentiation) transformed by the same, or even different, viruses. Clearly, if the virus genes of transformation code for a product that interferes at the level of regulation of cellular pathways, then one might expect to observe great variability depending upon the cell under study. Since major structural and functional cell surface molecules are glycolipids and glycoproteins (cf. Winzler, 1970) , it is not surprising to find that the metabolism of these molecules is severely affected by transformation.",

H a k o m o r i et al., 1972) that the synthesis of the complex heteroglycopolymers (glycolipids and glycoproteins) is curtailed or modified by the virus gene product for transformation. This hypothesis rests directly on chemical evidence described above. In addition it leans on the physiological data concerning altered lectin-binding sites, receptors, antigen reactivity, cell-cell interactions of contact inhibition, adhesion and junction formation, many of which are known to be mediated by glycoproteins and glycolipids of the cell surface (cf. Winzler, 1970;  and references cited in Table I ). In apparent support of this hypothesis have c o m e studies on specific glycopeptidyl and glycolipid glycosyltransferases (Grimes, 1970; D e n et al., 1971; Kijimoto and Hakomori, 1971; cf. Brady et al., 1973; Warren et al., 1972; Schengrund et ai, 1973) which show that the level of activity of these enzymes is lower (to the extent of 2-to 11-fold) in virus-transformed cells as compared with normal cells. H o w e v e r whether the decreased enzyme activity is a primary effect of virus transformation, or results from feedback control or repression, is not at all clear. T h e variations in enzyme activity observed are relatively small, considering the fact that the activity of glycopeptidyl-GlcNAc and sialyl transferases have been observed to vary by as much as 20-fold in 3 T 3 cells and 3 T 3 -S V 4 7 9 cells as they move through the cell cycle (R.

Plasma membrane preparations (depleted of surface glycoprotein) were obtained from 3T3-SV A26, 3T3-SV CE56, 3T3-SV 479, 3T3-Py6, and control 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. These were dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate plus mercaptoethanol and analyzed in Polyacrylamide gels as described elsewhere (Sheinin and Onodera, 1972). Material in 10 \u03bc\\ volumes containing, respectively, 368, 432, 443, 327 and 250 /u,g protein was subjected to electrophoresis at 8 mA/gel for 5-6 hours. Intensity of staining with Coomassie blue, is designated as follows: most intense, solid black, decreasing density of stain by decreasing degree of stipling.
