Darwinian fitness, defined as the advantage of a given genotype with respect to a reference one, is a mesoscopic property that captures into a single figure differences in performance at every stage of viral infection. But to which extent viral fitness results from particular molecular interactions with host factors and regulatory networks during infection? Can we identify host genes, and then functional classes, whose expression depends on viral fitness? Here, we compared the transcriptomes of tobacco plants infected with seven genotypes of tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) that differ in fitness. We found that the larger the fitness differences among genotypes, the more dissimilar the transcriptomic profiles are. Consistently, two different mutations, one in the viral RNA polymerase and another in the viral suppressor of RNA silencing, that led to close fitness values, also resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles. Moreover, we identified host genes whose expression showed a significant correlation, positive or negative, with TEV fitness. Over-expression of genes with positive correlation activates hormone-and RNA silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense. By contrast, underexpression of genes negatively correlated reduces metabolism, growth, and development.",

In the field of virology, it has become standard to measure fitness by growth-competition experiments in mixed infections with a reference strain 3,4 . With this experimental set up, fitness is just the relative ability of a viral strain to produce stable infectious progeny in a given host (cell type, organ, individual, or species) when the available resources have to be shared with a competitor 5 .",

Experimental evidences support that even single nucleotide substitutions have significant effects on viral fitness, regardless they are synonymous or nonsynonymous, or they affect coding or non-coding genomic regions 31-37 . A common trend among all these studies is that, whenever fitness is evaluated in the standard host, the distribution of mutational effects is highly skewed towards deleterious effects, with a large fraction of mutations being lethal. Furthermore, increasing evidences suggest that the shape and location of the distribution of fitness effects depends on the host species, being the difference among two hosts (e.g., a tested host and the natural one) greater as their genetic divergence increases 12, 20, 38, 39 .",

Significant differences existed among the fitness values of the seven viral genotypes chosen for this study ( Fig. 2A ; GLM likelihood ratio test: c 2 = 373.006, 6 df, P < 0.001) and among plants inoculated with the same viral genotype (c 2 = 2927.885, 14 df, P < 0.001).

To further explore the similarity in the perturbation induced by each viral genotype into the plants' transcriptome, we computed all pairwise Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (r) between the mean expression values for all genes in the microarray. Then, these correlations were used as a measure of similarity to build a UPGMA dendrogram. The rationale for this analysis is as follows: the more correlated two expression profiles are, the more similar the effects induced in infected plants. When comparing expression profiles from a pair of infected plants, a significant correlation may indicate that genes that changed expression relative to the mock-inoculated plants, are exactly the same in both samples, showing a similar expression pattern.

Next, following the same rationale than in the previous section, we sought to determine whether the number of DEGs also depends on the difference in fitness between WT and the mutant TEV genotypes. In this case, we hypothesized that the overlap in the lists of DEGs must be similar for WT and viruses of equivalent fitness (e.g., PC48 or PC55), whereas the magnitude of the overlap between DEG lists would decrease as differences in fitness exist. Of particular interest following all results presented above is the similarity between PC95, a mutant of the replicase NIb gene, and CLA11, a mutant of the VSR HC-Pro gene. These two mutations led to close fitness values ( Fig. 2A) , but also resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles (Fig. 4B ). At first sight, one may argue that their impact in transcriptomic profiles should be different since these mutations affect virus proteins that are functionally unrelated. However, our results suggest that the effects on the overall virus-host interaction of each mutant are canalized in the same way. This clearly exemplifies that viral fitness, despite its incompleteness, is a figure that contains high information about the virus-host interaction.

Together, these results suggest that positively correlated DEGs play a role in the transcriptional regulation of host defenses. By contrast, DEGs with negative correlation between expression and TEV fitness participate more in catalytic and transport activities than genes with positive correlation, suggesting a redirection of resources by the host to face the viral infection, which is not independent of viral fitness.

Plant-virus interactions result from the confrontation of two players with opposed strategies and interests. From the plant perspective, activation of basal defenses, immunity, hormone-regulated pathways, and RNA-silencing (some of which are not virusspecific) will result in an immediate benefit to control virus replication and spread. We found that there are plant's defense responses that are expressed upon infection regardless the fitness of the virus, and defense responses induced progressively as viral fitness increases. Consistent with the first mode, we observed the activation of the genes EDS1 and PAD4, components of R genemediated disease resistance with homology to lipases, in every infection studied in this work (Fig.   8A ). These are master regulators of plant defenses that connect pathogen signals with salicylic acid (SA) signaling 53 . SA is involved in resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogens, and in particular viruses 54, 55 . Consistent with the second mode, we observed the activation of many genes involved in defenses in an extent that is proportional to TEV fitness (Fig. 8A ). For example, the DCL2 and AGO1 genes -key for the RNA silencing response-, genes modulating resistance to pathogens such as the subtilisin-like protease (SBT1.9), or genes expressing proteins involved in hormone-regulated defenses such as GASA1 and VQ29, brassinosteroids (e.g., brassinosteroid However, these activations have a cost, mainly in terms of resources that can be invested into secondary metabolism and development. Consistent with this idea is the fact that many genes participating in metabolic processes (e.g., CYSC1, a cysteine synthase) are highly repressed upon infection (Fig. 8A ). There are also central genes for the plant metabolism whose repression correlates with viral fitness, such as GBSS1, photosystem components or assembly factors (e.g., HCF136) , Rubisco subunits and ATPases, catalases, transketolases, nucleotide and phosphate transporters, synthases involved in flavonoid, isoprenoid, ascorbate, or tryptophan biosynthesis, and GAPDH (Fig. 7) .",

TEV achieves this reprogramming by altering the expression of a series of genes in its own benefit. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/206789 doi: bioRxiv preprint For example, we found the expression of genes involved in actin cytoskeleton organization such as ADF4 and PFN3 to be negatively correlated with TEV fitness. The profilin PNF3 is a actinbinding protein and ADF4 participates in the depolymerization of actin filaments that results from microbial-associated molecular patterns being recognized by the corresponding patternrecognition receptors 59 . Therefore, by downregulating this function, longer and more stable actin filaments are produced that virions use to move around the cell from the ER-associated replication factories to plasmodesmata. Other example is the repression observed for the UBP1B gene, a negative regulator of potyvirus translation, that would allow for a more optimal virus accumulation 60 . Genes involved in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) defenses 61 , such as the ATP-dependent RNA helicase UPF1, also show reduction in levels of expression. Other group of proteins that show alteration during viral infection are those involved in protein degradation, via ubiquitination and downstream into the proteasome pathway (e.g., ubiquitin-protein ligase 1, UPL1; ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2, UBC2; ubiquitin E2 variant 1B, MMZ2; EIN3-binding F box protein 1, EBF) or via autophagy (e.g., the ATP-driven chaperone CDC48C and the plant autophagy adaptor NBR1). Moreover, TEV activates in a fitness-dependent manner the expression of genes RH8, an RNA helicase, and PCaP1, a membrane-associated cation-binding protein, also required by potyviruses for cell-to-cell movement 62 (Fig. 8A) , and of a diversity of transcription factors including global (e.g., GRA2, GTE8), sequence-specific (e.g., SACL1 and SPL12), GATA/NAC family members (e.g., GATA1, NAC083, NAC029), bZIP G-box finding factors (e.g., GBF1 and BZIP63), and involved in homeotic gene expression (e.g., AGL20 and homeobox-1). We also found genes related to genome integrity, (e.g., the cohesins SYN2 and SMC3, and the chromatin protein SPT2), DNA replication and nucleosome assembly, alternative splicing (e.g., SF1, an homolog nuclear splicing factor), chromatin transition (e.g., SPT16, an histone chaperone involved in transcription elongation from RNApolII promoters and regulation of chromatin transitions; or the histone acetyltransferase HAC1, a coactivator of gene transcription with a major role in controlling flowering time and also essential for resistance to bacterial infections), DNA replication and cell division (e.g., the mitotic cohesin RAD21 and the cyclin-dependent protein kinase CYCH1). However, not all host factors recruited by the virus present alterations in their expressions. According to our data, the translation initiation factor eIF4E, known to be exploited by TEV for its own translation 63 , was found to be unperturbed (Fig.   8A ) whilst eIF3A and eIF4G expression positively correlated with TEV fitness.",

But, certainly, more mutants should be analyzed in future work to provide a comprehensive picture, avoiding the bias towards certain virus proteins. In addition, we here focused on the transcription regulation, but other networks exist in the cell (e.g., metabolism, protein-protein interactions, \u2026), all them interlinked. To provide an insight on these other networks, we constructed the interactome (Fig. 8B) of HC-Pro with the host proteins known to interact with this virus protein 40 . We then contextualized our gene expression data over multiple TEV infections. Many of the cellular functions in which HC-Pro participate (protein degradation, translation, redox processes, and cation signaling) are not regulated transcriptionally upon infection (or regulated marginally). Presumably, the virus exploits these processes in its own benefit (mainly to enhance replication and movement within a cell), and the normal expression of the corresponding genes is sufficient for such subversion. By contrast, RNA silencing and methylation are functions involved in defense against pathogens that are quantitatively regulated, as a sort of control strategy exerted by the plant, as long as they are needed, that is, according to viral fitness.",

Our observation that viral fitness indeed correlates positively or negatively with the expression of certain genes is of particular interest. By simply measuring the fitness of the virus infecting a given host, we may predict the whole genomic profile of the host cell to characterize its state (molecular impact of infection). Moreover, by specifically targeting host genes that are essential for high fitness virus variants but not for milder ones, we may prevent the spreading of the former variants, while still allowing mild variants to replicate and, perhaps, act as attenuated vaccines that enhance the antiviral response of the plant.",

However, little is known on how viral fitness informs about the underlying changes occurring in host gene expression and protein function at a genome wide scale. In this work, we have investigated the potential association between viral fitness and host transcriptional regulation upon infection as a first step into this direction. To address this, we characterized the transcriptomic profiles of Nicotiana tabacum plants inoculated with a collection of genotypes of Tobacco etch virus (TEV; genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae) that differ in their fitness in this natural host",

Fig. 4B illustrates the number of DEGs in common between all pairs of transcriptomes from infected plants. The heat-map shows a pattern of modularity, with three well defined modules.

Lists of genes are somehow hard to interpret and functional analyses provide a good tool to cluster genes into groups with related functions. To this end, we performed an analysis of enriched functional categories (GO terms) for each viral genotype.Fig. 5illustrates the way that plants infected with each one of the seven TEV genotypes differ in the functional categories significantly over-represented relative to the mock-inoculated plants.Fig. 5shows the GO terms in planes ordered from the highest to the lowest viral fitness. In red, we represent categories that are significantly enriched by up-expressedDEGs, in blue categories that are significantly enriched by down-expressed DEGs, and in pink categories enriched in both types of DEGs; the surface of each circle is proportional to the number of DEGs included in each category. The upper plane shows the functional categories altered in plants infected with WT TEV, with metabolic process (GO:0008152) containing the largest number and photosynthesis (GO:0015979) the smallest one. Regulation of response to biotic stimulus (GO:0002831), defense response (GO:006952), immune system process (GO:0002376), protein modification process (GO:0036211), hormone-mediated signaling (GO:0009755), and cell death (GO:008219) are all enriched in up-expressed DEGs, while photosynthesis, lipid metabolic process (GO:0006629), and regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process (GO:0051171) are categories significantly enriched in down-expressed DEGs. More wisely defined categories such as metabolic process, unspecific response to stress (GO:0006950), response to stimulus (GO:0050896), response to abiotic stimulus (GO:0009628), localization (GO:0051641), or transport (GO:0008150) are enriched in both types of DEGs. Therefore, overall speaking, genes involved in different aspects of plant defense pathways and response to infection are up-expressed, while genes involved in metabolism and photosynthesis are downexpressed. The second fitness plane corresponds to genotypes PC48 and PC55, both of mild effect and carrying mutation in the CI gene. The most remarkable difference between these two genotypes and the rest of genotypes is the significant enrichment in up-expressed DEGs related to signal transduction (GO:0007165) and regulation of gene expression (GO:0010468). Drifting down in the virus' fitness scale, the next plane in Fig. 5 corresponds to genotype PC95, which shows a similar distribution of GOs than the WT except a loss of enrichment in up-expressed DEGs in the regulation of response to biotic stress category. Next plane corresponds to genotypes CLA2 and CLA11 of moderate fitness and carrying point mutations in the HC-Pro gene. Plants infected with these two viral genotypes differ from plants infected with the WT virus in three main functional categories: the loss of significant enrichment in the hormone-mediated signaling category, and a significant enrichment in up-expressed DEGs into the localization and transport categories. Finally, the bottom plane in the fitness scale corresponds to genotype AS13 (Fig. 5), which has very low fitness and induces no symptoms or very mild symptoms. These differences and severity of symptoms have a direct translate into the enrichment of the different functional categories. Compared to WT, metabolic process is now enriched with down-expressed DEGs whilst unspecific response to stress is very much enriched now in up-expressed DEGs, and response to stimulus, protein modification process, localization, and transport are not enriched in any particular type of DEGs. Moreover, no significant enrichment in the hormone-mediated signaling module was found in plants infected with AS13, likewise it was observed for the other HC-Pro mutant genotypes CLA2 and CLA11. Correlation between gene expression and viral fitness. Taken together, the results shown in the previous sections suggest a transcriptomic response of plants to infection varies with the fitness of the virus being inoculated. This observation motivated us to identify genes whose expression significantly correlates with viral fitness; that is, systematic changes in virus fitness are associated with an increase or decrease in the expression level of a particular gene. This is a correlation analysis and as such does not assume a functional dependence between viral fitness and the expression of individual host genes. Yet, it may provide a list of candidate genes to be considered as determinants of viral fitness. We computed a non-parametric Spearman's correlation coefficient between viral fitness and the normalized degree of expression (z-score) for each one of the N. tabacum genes previously characterized as DEGs (Fig. 3A). A total of 326 DEGs show a significant positive correlation and 154 DEGs show a significant negative correlation (Fig. 6A; red dots for positively correlated genes, blue dots for negatively correlated ones; data in Supplementary Dataset S4). Next, we sought to explore which functional categories and molecular functions, if any, were enriched among these two subsets of DEGs. Results are shown in Fig. 6B and functional annotations are all reported in the Supplementary Dataset S4. There are significant differences in the distribution of positively and negatively correlated DEGs into different functional categories (Fig. 6B, left column: c 2 = 29.225, 6 d.f., P < 0.001), being the difference moderate in magnitude (Cram\u00e9r's V = 0.304). Amongst DEGs whose expression is positively correlated with viral fitness, biological regulation (GO:0065008) and developmental processes (GO:0032502)are strongly enriched compared with the negatively correlated DEGs. By contrast, negatively correlated DEGs disproportionally contribute more than positively correlated ones to the categories response to stimulus, localization, metabolic processes, and cell death. Focusing in molecular functions(Fig. 6B, right column), a significant difference also exists among DEGs whose expression is positively-and negatively correlated with viral fitness (c 2 = 36.720, 6 d.f., P < 0.001), being the magnitude of the difference in the moderate to large magnitude range(Cram\u00e9r's V = 0.341). On the one hand, among positively correlated DEGs, nucleic acid binding (GO:003676) shows the largest departure from negatively correlated ones. On the other hand, catalytic activity (GO:003824) and transporter activity (GO:0005215) are the two molecular",

After all, the progress of a viral infection depends on the fitness of the virus mutant swarm. Classically, viral fitness has been evaluated by means of parameters describing the absolute growth and accumulation or by competition experiments 3,4 , or even by correlating it with the development of host's symptoms4,32 . We focused on the infections exerted by different genotypes of a given virus in the same host. Fitness differences among genotypes are due to several causes. First, they may be a direct consequence effect of mutations on viral proteins, perhaps even resulting in altered folding, and thus jeopardizing their functions. Second, in the case of mutations affecting regulatory regions (e.g., RNA stems and loops), the effect may be due to altered structural configurations that impede the binding of virus own proteins or of cellular factors. Plenty of examples illustrate the effect of mutations via these two mechanisms36 . A third, more tantalizing, yet poorly explored possibility is that mutated viral components (i.e., RNAs and proteins) may interact in non-optimal ways with the complex network of genetic and biochemical interactions of the cell as a whole. Interacting in non-optimal ways with any of the elements of the host regulatory and biochemical networks may have profound effects in the progression of a successful infection and thereof in viral fitness.In this work, we considered mutations affecting the CI protein (with RNA helicase, ATPase, and membrane activities), the viral replicase NIb, and the HC-Pro protein (VSR, protease, and helpercomponent during transmission by aphids). Our results point out that fitness, irrespective of what type of mutation is introduced, is a good indicator of how a given mutant reprograms gene expression patterns, into its own benefit or as a consequence of cellular defenses (e.g.,Fig. 3C).Despite the interest of this hypothesis, none of the early studies tackled the relationship between genotype and fitness of the virus and transcriptomic profiles of the host in a systematic manner, but rather focused on comparing two viral genotypes. Evolution experiments simulating the spillover of TEV from its natural host N. tabacum into a novel, poorly susceptible one, Arabidopsis thaliana, have shown that adaptation of TEV to the novel host (i.e., concomitant to large increases in fitness) was associated with a profound change in the way the ancestral and evolved viruses interacted with the plant's transcriptome, with genes involved in the response to biotic stresses, including signal transduction and innate immunity pathways, being significantly under-expressed in plants infected with the evolved virus than in plants infected with the ancestral one 64 . Further evolution experiments into different ecotypes of A. thaliana that differed in their susceptibility to infection illustrated a pattern of adaptive radiation in which viruses were better",
