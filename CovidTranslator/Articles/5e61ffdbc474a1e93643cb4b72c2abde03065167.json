Selected O,O-dibenzylphosphonate acyclonucleotides were transformed into the respective phosphonic acids. All compounds were evaluated in vitro for activity against a broad variety of DNA and RNA viruses and for cytostatic activity against murine leukemia L1210, human T-lymphocyte CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells. Compound (1S,2S)-16b exhibited antiviral activity against Influenza A H3N2 subtype (EC 50 = 20 lM-visual CPE score; EC 50 = 18 lM-MTS method; MCC >100 lM, CC 50 >100 lM) in Madin Darby canine kidney cell cultures (MDCK), and (1S,2S)-16k was active against vesicular stomatitis virus and respiratory syncytial virus in HeLa cells (EC 50 = 9 and 12 lM, respectively). Moreover, compound (1R,2S)-16l showed activity against both herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2) in HEL cell cultures (EC 50 = 2.9 and 4 lM, respectively) and feline herpes virus in CRFK cells (EC 50 = 4 lM) but at the same time it exhibited cytotoxicity toward uninfected cell (MCC P 4 lM). Several other compounds have been found to inhibit proliferation of L1210, CEM as well as HeLa cells with IC 50 in the 4-50 lM range. Among them compounds (1S,2S)-and (1R,2S)-16l were the most active (IC 50 in the 4-7 lM range).",

This enzyme has earlier been shown to be an attractive target for poxviruses, (\u00c0)RNA viruses such as paramyxovirus and rhabdovirus, and (\u00b1)RNA viruses such as reovirus. 15, 16 Consequently, (2 0 S)-9-(2 0 ,3 0 -dihydroxypropyl)adenine 3 10 and other N(9)-substituted adenines and guanines possessing polyhydroxyalkyl chains have been obtained (Fig. 1) .",

All rights reserved. acyclic 1,2,3-triazolyl analogues of nucleosides/nucleotides with nucleobases attached via the methylene group at the C4 in the 1,2,3-triazole moiety have been obtained and some of them showed promising biological activity (Fig. 2) . While (1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)nucleosides 9-11 were found to be inactive against selected viruses, 22,23 the phosphonomethyl-12 (n = 1; B = Thy, Ade) and phosphonoethyl(1,2,3-triazoles) 12 (n = 2; R = Thy, Ura) showed moderate activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV). 25 Recently, we succeeded in the synthesis of 1-(3-phosphonopropyl)-1,2,3-triazole 13 substituted with benzoylbenzuracil via a methylene linker which exhibited activity against herpes simplex virus-1 (KOS), herpes simplex virus-2 (G) and feline herpes virus. 33 Moreover, the 1-(3-amino-3-phosphonopropyl)-1,2,3-triazole analogue (R)-14 having 3-acetylindole as a modified nucleobase showed moderate activity toward vesicular stomatitis virus. 35 In continuation of our research program towards 1,2,3-triazole nucleoside analogues, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] and taking into account the known biological activity of hydroxylated nucleoside analogues as well as the antiviral activity of 13 and 14 and the cytostatic properties of 15, 1,2,3-triazoles 16 and 17 possessing dibenzyloxyphosphono(polyhydroxy)alkyl residues have been designed (Fig. 3) . We assumed that incorporation of additional hydroxyl groups into an alkyl side-chain would assure better solubility and perhaps improve biological activity of 1,2,3-triazoles 16 and 17 in comparison with analogous compounds having unfunctionalised aliphatic moieties. 33 2.

This trend well correlates with our previous observations on structurally analogous (1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)nucleotides having an unsubstituted phosphonopropyl chain, since compound 13 was the most active against HSV-1, HSV-2 (EC 50 = 17 lM) and against feline herpes virus (EC 50 = 24 lM). 33 Furthermore, the stereochemistry of the aliphatic chain substituted with hydroxyl groups is essential for activity since analogue (1S,2S)-16l showed no activity. On the other hand, the significant activity toward vesicular stomatitis virus and respiratory syncytial virus in HeLa cell cultures was observed for compound (1S,2S)-16k containing an N 3 -benzoyluracil unit (EC 50 = 9 and 12 lM, respectively) since analogous compounds (1S,2S)-16l (B = N 3 -benzoylbenzuracil) and (1S,2S)-16c (B = uracil) were inactive against these viruses. Again, stereochemistry of an aliphatic fragment appeared important and resulted in lack of activity for (1R,2S)-16k. ",

The suspension was microwave irradiated in the microwave reactor (Plazmatronika RM 800, 800 W) at 40-45\u00b0C for 20 min. After cooling the solvent was removed by vacuum evaporation. The residue was suspended in chloroform (5 mL) and filtered through a layer of Celite. The solution was concentrated in vacuo and the crude product was purified on a silica gel column with chloroform-methanol mixtures (50:1, 20:1 or 10:1, v/v) to give the desired 1,2,3triazoles.4.2.1.

The antiviral, other than anti-HIV, assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey cells (Vero), human epithelial cells (HeLa) or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) . Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (VZV) in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virusinfected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque formation by 50%.",
