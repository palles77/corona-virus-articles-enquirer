By 4 Feb 2020 a total 24,324 cases have been confirmed infection nationwide with 3,219 severe cases, 490 death cases, and another 23,260 suspected cases [3] . Reports have also been released of exported cases in many other countries. WHO had determined this situation should be deemed a public health emergency of international concern on 30 Jan 2020 [4] . Symptoms of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia (NCIP) include fever and/or respiratory illness, lymphopenia, and radiologic abnormality [5] [6] [7] , among these clinical features, radiologic characteristics of NCIP are especially important for diagnosing and predicting prognosis. We herein summarize the clinical and radiologic characteristics of 27 confirmed cases and analyze the association of radiologic findings with mortality cases.",

The CT findings were graded on a 3-point scale: 1 as normal attenuation, 2 as ground-glass attenuation, and 3 as consolidation. Each lung zone, with a total of six lung zones in each patient, was assigned a following scale according to distribution of the affected lung parenchyma: 0 as normal, 1 as < 25% abnormality, 2 as 25-50% abnormality, 3 as 50-75% abnormality, and 4 as > 75% abnormality.

Merely consolidation, central distribution only, pleural effusions or lymphadenopathy were relatively rarely seen. Initially the CT images might be GGO nodules or patchy GGO mostly peripherally distributed then consolidations and extensive distributions were seen when pneumonia progressed. Consolidation, air bronchogram, extensive distribution as well as multiple involved lung zones were more common in mortality group, suggesting a more severe clinical course for these abnormalities can be pathologically correlated with diffuse alveolar damage and similar conclusions can be drawn in H1N1 pneumonia, N5N1 pneumonia, H7N9",

Diagnosis of NCIP was made by positive test for 2019-nCoV viral RNA, in throat-swab specimens collected from patients by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using standard RTPCR protocol at Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The median age of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018), especially comorbid hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac disease. 12 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required non-invasive ventilator mechanical ventilation, 11 of whom died, and one 36 years old man (oxygenation index: 184 mmHg) recovered after treatment. There were no significant differences between survival group and mortality group with respect to patient sex and symptoms. The CT features, including the location, extent and distribution of involvement of each abnormality were shown in table 2. The median days of CT scans were 8 (IQR 5-11) before symptom onset in all patients. The predominant CT characteristics consisted of ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and central distribution (74%), and lower zone involved (96%).
