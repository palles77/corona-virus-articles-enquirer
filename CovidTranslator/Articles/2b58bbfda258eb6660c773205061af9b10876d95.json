Hospital outbreak and nosocomial transmission were reported, however, several issues remain on the viral excretion course. Objectives: Describe the kinetics and pattern of viral excretion in two infected patients. Study design: After the initial diagnosis, blood, urine, rectal and respiratory samples were collected regularly, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay targeted the UpE and Orf1a regions of the MERS-CoV genome. Results: In patient 1, who died of refractory ARDS and renal failure, MERS-CoV RNA was detected in pharyngeal and tracheal swabs, as well blood samples and urine samples until the 30th day. Rectal swabs were negative. Patient 2 also developed multiple-organ failure, but survived, with persisting renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance at 30 mL/min) and persistent interstitial syndrome albeit weaned off mechanical ventilation and no longer requiring oxygen. Tracheal aspirations were positive until the 33rd day, while nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. All other biological samples were negative. Discussion: Lower respiratory tract excretion of MERS-CoV could be observed for more than one month. The most severely ill patient presented an expression of the virus in blood and urine, consistent with a type-1 interferon mediated immunological response impaired in patient 1, but developed by patient 2. These results suggest that infection control precautions must be adequately evaluated in clinical wards and laboratories exposed to MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus which appeared in the Arabian Peninsula in June 2012 [1] . The MERS-CoV belongs to the order of Nidovirales, the family of Coronaviridae and the genus of Betacoronavirus [2] . Coronaviruses are large enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses that can infect birds and mammals [3] . Since the mid-1960s, human coronaviruses were known for causing common cold (HcoV-229 and OC43), and in the 2000s they were found to cause bronchiolitis (NL63) and pneumonia mainly during the SARS epidemic (HKU-1 and SARS-CoV) [4] . Although asymptomatic infections have been reported, the MERS-CoV causes severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress and multiple-organ failure leading to a high mortality rate [5] . A recently published analysis showed that patients with severe disease had at least one underlying http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.07.002 1386-6532/\u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. condition, including diabetes, hypertension, chronic cardiac disease and chronic renal disease [6] . This study also showed that both community-acquired and health care associated MERS-CoV infections occur in patients with chronic comorbid conditions [7] . As of 11 June, 699 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with MERS-CoV have been reported to the World Health Organization, including at least 209 deaths [8] . Several cases had been described in other countries than the Arabian Peninsula but all patients had a history of travel to the Middle East, except secondary cases described in UK and France [9, 10] .",

Futhermore, detection of viral RNA in samples from the upper respiratory tract such as nasal and throat swabs, or nasopharyngeal aspirates, may remain negative while lower respiratory tract samples are positive [11] . To date, only few studies have reported detection of MERS-CoV RNA in blood, urine and stool samples [11, 12] . However, many questions remain unsolved, and recently it was underlined that additional data are needed to document the natural history of the infection, the excretion pattern and viral kinetics during infection, and the best samples for optimal Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) yield [6] .",

Briefly, patient 1, a 64-year-old man, had undergone renal transplantation in 1998 for renal failure secondary to diabetes. Regular medications included mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, and prednisone. Clinical symptoms began on April 22 upon returning from travel to Duba\u00ef; he was transferred to the Lille University Teaching Hospital intensive care unit (ICU) and intubated on April 30. On May 8, the patient required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, and died on May 28 from refractory multiple organ failure. Patient 2, a 51-year-old man, was admitted on April 26. His medical history included a histamine-induced angioedema treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. He shared patient 1's room from April 26 to April 29. On May 8, he presented with asthenia, myalgia, and cough. On May 12, he was intubated and transferred to the Lille University Teaching Hospital ICU. The patient required ECMO support on May 14 for refractory hypoxemia despite optimal treatment. The patient was successfully weaned off ECMO on June 17. On July 2, percutaneous tracheotomy was performed. He required 3 days of intermittent haemodialysis per week until mid-July.",

Our data confirm previous studies showing that the detection of viral RNA from oronasal swabs can be negative even though MERS-CoV RNA was detected in tracheobronchial aspirates throughout the course of infection in case of fatal outcome [12] . It has been previously reported that samples collected from the lower respiratory tract were more relevant for diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection [9, 11, 12] . Here, we show that these samples are also more relevant for the follow-up of MERS-CoV infection. Since respiratory viral excretion was sustained for more than one month after the onset of infection, standard, contact, and airborne precautions must remain unchanged and applied correctly to avoid nosocomial transmission, which is still possible as described in several countries, including transmission to healthcare professionals [11, 16] . However, the question of MERS virus viability in different samples, and hence infectivity of these samples remains unanswered. By comparison with other respiratory viruses, in immunocompetent patients, Influenzavirus RNA detection was detected for a few days while a long-term detection of coronavirus RNA has been shown previously in severe immunocompromised patients [17, 18] . Detection of human coronaviruses RNA in stool samples has been observed [19, 20] but, excepted for SARS-CoV, the duration of the detection of human coronaviruses RNA in stool samples of patients was never studied [21, 22] . Human coronaviruses RNA was never detected in urine of patients with exception for SARS-CoV RNA (Lau et al. [22] ).",

Interestingly, both patients developed renal failure requiring renal replacement, but the virus was only found in the urinary tract of the viremic patient. However, the relationship between the virus renal tropism and the physiopathology of the renal failure is not so clear, and the questions of independent renal viral replication and/or active urinary secretion of the virus remain unsolved. Of note, the detection of viral RNA in one dialysate sample was negative, but it is difficult to conclude in only one sample.",
