Some investigators have contended that the establishment of regional networks for disease surveillance actually may diminish the ability of low resource settings to establish such competence. 1 This article examines this theoretic possibility by closely describing the experience of regional networks, focusing on two such networks, the Middle East Consortium on Infectious Disease Surveillance (MECIDS) and the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS) networks. These two cases clarify the contribution of such networks to the successful implementation of the IHR.",

            "text": "The past 2 decades have witnessed increasing globalization of commerce, travel, financial flows, production chains, and services. The market forces behind this globalization do not always apply to public safety and protection; thus, the public health sector has been slow to globalize and too few within the economic and trade sectors embrace the urgency of supporting the transnationalization of public health. While globalization of the health sector inches along, extension of production chains and intensification of agriculture stress public health security at the point of origin (commonly in resource poor settings). 2 High-profile pandemics (eg, HIV/AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] ) point to the lack of an effective global public health safety net. Fig. 1 illustrates the challenge of transnational infection and the need for transnational response. Resource poor settings continue to struggle with high levels of preventable and treatable endemic and epidemic diseases. Given the lack of economic incentive to globalize public health protection, the task of realizing this global public good rests with national governments, international agencies, and philanthropic interests. 3 As travel and commerce so thoroughly interconnect the globe that an outbreak in Asia today may be an outbreak in North America tomorrow, or vice versa, the rhetoric of global disease security has become more urgent. Although there are potentially several drivers for the rise of regional networks for surveillance, at least two are in play. First, as markets globalize, consolidation and scale of activity gain importance. Increasingly active trading economies have come together in larger economic groups (eg, the European Union and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC]). As blocs of trading economies have emerged, new common concerns about health security also have come to the fore. Second, in postconflict areas divided by war, common geographic zones of activity come together for mutual economic benefit during recovery. As commerce and travel increase economic integration, population health security becomes an important issue. This article provides a brief review of the rise of regional groupings of countries that have created networks for disease surveillance and examines theoretically and through the experiences of these regional networks how they may facilitate the implementation of the revised IHR (2005) . Although this article offers a catalog of several of these systems (Table 1) , the universe of networks described is not exhaustive. Discussion focuses on the regional networks of MECIDS and MBDS, which illustrate the challenges and opportunities these networks afford.",

Zoonotic origin accounts for the majority of these events, 4 and the increasing need to coordinate human and animal health is an additional challenge for nascent surveillance systems. With the renewed appreciation for the speed of transmission of agents given modern travel volumes and rates, speed and accuracy of information become more important. Additionally, with the broad geographic dispersal of pathogens in products and people, the ability to sensitively, specifically, and promptly identify particular strains or subtypes of organisms using modern diagnostic techniques becomes important. Such identification is critical for (1) effective disease investigation to detect the source, (2) vaccine development, and (3) tailoring treatment regimens for individual patients affected.",

The ongoing occurrence of emergent infections provoked a resolution calling for the revision of the IHR (1969) at the 1995 World Health Assembly. In 2001, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution on global health security epidemic alert and response in which WHO was to support its member states in identifying, verifying, and responding to public health emergencies of international concern. In 2002, the World Health Assembly reiterated the need to revise the IHR to reflect the changes in its resolution, global public health response to natural occurrences, and accidental release or deliberate use of biologic, chemical, or nuclear agents that affect health. The outbreak of SARS, however, prompted the World Health Assembly, in 2003, to decide on establishing the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Revision of the IHR to accelerate the process.",

The passage of the IHR puts the world on a fast track to implementation. Networks, such as MECIDS and MBDS, have reinforced national compliance efforts. The regulations dictate minimum requirements for surveillance and response, although their explicit agenda is to upgrade these systems on national levels and provide specific measures to prevent disease spread at airports and other entry points. 6 WHO maintains that surveillance is the cornerstone of efficient disease control and the key to mounting an effective response, 6 and the revised regulations provide some mechanism for WHO to collaborate with member states after notification. 7 In an era of globalized infectious diseases, all countries are believed to have a stake in the success or failure of surveillance and response capacity development in any one country.",

Thus, regional surveillance networks, such as MBDS and MECIDS, can facilitate the IHR and play an important role in their implementation. For example, in 2007, MECIDS members convened a workshop on implementing the IHR in the event of an influenza pandemic. This event was held in cooperation with WHO headquarters and WHO offices in the Eastern Mediterranean and European regions.

For example, each member state has to ensure that it has the laboratory capacity to rapidly identify outbreaks; 1,6 to do so, provisions for technical support and extra resources for less-developed countries also are written into the revised IHR (2005). 1 The core response capacity requirements apply at all public health response levels-from local to intermediate to national. 9 Strengthening national public health capacities contributes to improving national and international readiness to detect, verify, investigate, and control disease outbreaks that have the potential to spread internationally. 7 Importantly, the revised IHR specify measures to prevent disease spread at designated points of entry. 6, 9 Operational and technologic communications and trust across countries are central tenets of regional surveillance networks. Moreover, each country's particular strengths can be leveraged across regional network partner nations. MECIDS and MBDS have acted as catalysts for the introduction and spread of new communications and laboratory technologies. For example, MBDS members are working with several international funding and technical partners to increase technical capacity for surveillance and disease control through computing; high-speed Internet access recently has been enhanced by the Trans-Eurasia Information Network 2 effort in Vietnam. When Vietnam lacked such Internet capacity in 2006, Thailand facilitated Vietnam's participation in the multinational videoconference on pandemic preparedness (organized by APEC Emerging Infections Network) by hosting the Vietnamese representatives at their videoconference center. As another example, tabletop exercises in individual MBDS countries and a regional MBDS exercise suggest that each country has unique strengths that can be considered for application across the region, such as electronic surveillance reporting in China; epidemiology training in Thailand; laboratory capacity in Thailand, China, and Vietnam; community surveillance in Cambodia; and government organization for national influenza preparedness in Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) (Dr. Moe Ko Oo, MBDS Coordinator, personal communication, 2008).",

The constant flow of goods, family ties among Palestinians residing in the three countries, and human travelers that pass over their borders each day has led Tulchinsky to refer to these inexorably related countries as one ''epidemiologic family''. 14 Before the Palestinian uprising (intifada), which began in 2000, a young but healthy cooperation existed on health matters between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. With the conflict, communication and collaboration came to be low profile as far as public health issues were concerned. 15, 16 In this political climate, two international nongovernmental organizations, Search for Common Ground and the Global Health and Security Initiative (GHSI), which operates within the Nuclear Threat Initiative, facilitated the establishment of MECIDS in 2003. MECIDS is considered a unique model of trilateral sustainable activity. This intergovernmental partnership among the Ministries of Health in Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinian Authority has been effective on many levels, including harmonizing diagnostic and reporting methodologies; common training; data sharing and analysis; improving detection and control of infectious diseases; facilitating cross-border communication; dealing with avian influenza outbreaks in the three countries; 15 and, finally, creating the potential for the trust and cooperation fostered through this collaboration to translate into cooperation on other issues. 17 Using the layered structure of the public health services in each of its member countries, MECIDS currently gathers data on food-borne illnesses caused by two pathogens, salmonella and shigella, at the district, national, and international levels. At the district level, a network of clinical laboratories covers the many districts of each country; the national level includes a national center for disease control and a national laboratory; and the international level consists of one regional health information center-the Cooperative Monitoring Center in Amman, Jordan. National centers for disease control collect data from their district laboratories and report important information to the regional center in Amman. This hierarchic architecture allows for systematic disease reporting that helps identify potentially dangerous situations before they become serious epidemics. 18 The second example of regional surveillance is MBDS, a collaboration between Cambodia, China (Yunnan and Guangsi provinces), Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. Southeast Asia experienced intense conflict during the Cold War era but has since made enormous strides toward peace and economic development. Implementation of trade liberalization policies, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade Area, the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy, and the entry of Vietnam and Thailand into APEC, have greatly increased the ease with which goods, services, and capital flow throughout the region. 19 With support from the Rockefeller Foundation, WHO, and other organizations, MBDS was established in 1999 to deal with the public health challenges of high-volume regional trade and travel. Its activities include epidemiologic training, cross-border exchange of information, joint epidemic response and investigation, and joint tabletop exercises on pandemic influenza preparedness. 20 Because some MBDS member countries belong to WHO's Western Pacific region (Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, and Vietnam) whereas others belong to the Southeast Asian region (Myanmar and Thailand), coordination under the WHO umbrella adds some bureaucratic burden. Based on trust and close friendships, built through many years of interactive learning and collective action, MBDS has played an important role in filling this bureaucratic gap.",

Public-private partnerships for infectious disease surveillance are becoming increasingly common. An encouraging effort has begun, with support from the Rockefeller Foundation and GHSI, to develop a process for the various operating and nascent regional infectious disease surveillance systems to share best practices on issues, such as governance and the technical aspects of cross-border surveillance. 22 This effort should have the effect of bringing more government and private sector resources into infectious disease surveillance capabilities, which, if sustained, will bring about an increase in overall global surveillance capacity. This complements the essential and more topdown efforts of the WHO's strategy for epidemic alert and response that also relies on collaborative partners, including WHO Collaborating Centres, nongovernmental organizations, and industry. 7 Countries, therefore, will benefit from the renewed impetus to strengthen national capacity in surveillance and response and from the enhanced access to international investors interested in improving health in countries across the world, in the interest of global health and security. 7",

With mandatory reporting procedures and requirements for building surveillance and response capacity, the revised IHR are a move toward more effective global health security. The revised regulations have broadened and diversified the effort for global infectious disease control. This article has addressed the rise of regional networks and focused on how two such networks have contributed to the implementation of the IHR. Specifically, through hosting regional workshops for IHR implementation, introducing and implementing communications and laboratory technologies in member countries, responding to regional outbreak events, and linking field investigation efforts to response, the networks have moved their member groups closer to the implementation goal. Far from diminishing the abilities of fragile public health systems, these networks have reinforced operational competence.",

            "text": "In resource-poor settings and regions of political instability, the need for cooperation is even more urgent. The examples of MBDS and MECIDS illustrate the benefits of regional cooperation, communication, and trust building. They demonstrate that historical conflict, and even current political strife, can be overcome by focusing on common interests. The trust and communication MECIDS and MBDS partners built were a foundation for upgrading the infectious disease surveillance systems in each country, in terms of training personnel and purchasing laboratory and information technology equipment. Through successful communication and capacity building, these networks have effectively responded to disease outbreaks (eg, MECIDS's response to the 2006 outbreak of avian influenza and MBDS's response to the cholera outbreaks of 2007) and increased their ability to address future emerging infectious disease threats. As is true with MBDS and MECIDS, regional networks have greater access to international investors whose objectives are to strengthen the health of recipient countries while also improving overall global health security. Investment is a key concept in the new paradigm; it is an idea that the return on an investment in surveillance capacity and cross-border cooperation is the improved health of all nations and all global citizens. The revised IHR (2005) provide the impetus for change, and regional networks are one important way of achieving that change.",
