However, they are usually based on some unrealistic assumptions, the most crucial of which is often the oversimplified description of the interaction between individuals. In fact, it is well known that the social structure of a population influences the dynamics of an epidemic spreading through it (e.g. Edmunds et al. 1997) .",

Therefore, despite the increasing computational power available to researchers today, analytically tractable models remain invaluable tools in understanding the role that different factors play in the spread of the infection. Furthermore, the fact that no or very little computational power is required for their analysis and application makes them very attractive for policy information when quick results are needed, as, for example, in the case of emerging infection outbreaks (Roberts 2004 (Roberts , 2007 Aldis 2005) . The models referred to in this paper are simple enough to allow for some analytical tractability, while including some of the key features of a social structure Ball et al. 1997; Ball & Neal 2002; Fraser 2007) , which make them slightly more realistic than oversimplified models assuming homogeneous mixing.",

Its importance arises because it provides a link between mathematical models, actual epidemics and public health planning, which is relatively independent of other underlying details (Grassly & Fraser 2008) . If one can calculate R 0 as a function of the underlying parameters, which characterize the mechanisms of transmission and the effects of public health interventions, then direct analytical insight is immediately gained into how these parameters relate to the intensity and magnitude of an ensuing epidemic. If this number is smaller than 1, the infectious agent is unable to sustain itself in the population; when it is bigger than 1, although random events could cause the extinction of the pathogen after a few cases, there is a positive probability for a large epidemic to take off. In addition to this threshold property, R 0 has a simple relationship with the critical vaccination coverage p crit , i.e. the fraction of the population that one needs to vaccinate in order to avoid a major outbreak,",

Such an a priori assumption has been supported by complex microsimulations (Elveback et al. 1971 (Elveback et al. , 1976 and has recently been confirmed more quantitatively from the behaviour of similar but larger and more robustly parametrized studies (Longini et al. 2004 (Longini et al. , 2005 Ferguson et al. 2005 Ferguson et al. , 2006 Germann et al. 2006; Riley & Ferguson 2006) . Moreover, the household is often the fundamental unit at which control policies are targeted, because of both practical reasons (people who want or are asked to limit their movements are more likely to stay at home than anywhere else) and structural reasons (decisions about action or compliance to control policies are usually taken by the family as a unit).",

This average takes into account the fact that larger households are more likely to be infected than smaller ones. Note that the factorization of R \u00c3 is a non-trivial result and depends on our model assumptions (see the electronic supplementary material or Ball et al. (1997) and Andersson & Britton (2000) for more details). The basic reproduction number R 0 can still be defined in this model, although care needs to be taken in describing what a typical infectious case is. Some authors (e.g. Ball et al. 1997 ) consider a typical case as a randomly selected individual in a fully susceptible population. In this case, when R 0 O1, the infection quickly spreads in the household of the initial case, but may still be unable to spread widely between households and may not result in a large epidemic, i.e. R 0 is not a useful threshold parameter. We personally prefer to maintain the threshold property of R 0 , and we do so by letting the infection spread through the household of the first randomly selected case in the population and then defining a typical case by averaging across all the individuals infected in the household. Unfortunately, with such a definition, the nonlinearity induced by the quick depletion of susceptibles within the households makes R 0 analytically intractable, because the number of new cases generated by an infective varies according to how many susceptibles are still present in the household and is therefore difficult to compute. R \u00c3 does not suffer from this problem since it refers to entire households (the complexity due to the local depletion of susceptibles is captured in m) and the householdto-household infection process becomes linear in the limit of an infinite number of households and in the initial phase of the epidemic (Ball et al. 1997; Fraser 2007) . As for R 0 in the homogeneously mixing case, R \u00c3 is linked to a critical vaccination coverage by the formula",

In Ball & Neal (2008) , superimposed to global infections, local infections occur between individuals (and not households) on a random contact network with specified degree distribution. In the infinite population limit, local saturation can be neglected and therefore only direct infections are attributed to each infective; for this reason, the threshold parameter obtained is actually the basic reproduction number R 0 . In our model, the network representing local contacts consists of fully connected sub-graphs (households and workplaces), joint by single nodes, and local infections between households spread through workplace , and assuming that all workplaces have size nZ6 and that the epidemic in a workplace spreads according to the standard SIR model defined in Ball (1983;  see also Ball (1986) and Andersson & Britton (2000) and the electronic supplementary material), with infectious period of fixed length and individualto-individual infection rate b/(nK1). The results are similar for other values of n, thus showing that it can be extended to a non-singular workplace size distribution (the value of m H already takes into account variable sizes for households). The model is equivalent to a Reed-Frost model with individualto-individual escaping probability pZexp(Kb/(nK1)) (see Ludwig (1975) and Pellis et al. (2008) and the electronic supplementary material). Other model assumptions (other distributions for the length of the infectious periods in the standard SIR model or other models with time-varying infection rates) lead to qualitatively similar results. epidemics, where the nonlinearity induced by the local saturation is bypassed by referring all cases in a workplace epidemic to the primary case.",

As a numerical example, let (R g , m H , m W )Z(1/3, 1, 1); while R \u00c3 ZN, R H Z2. We therefore know that the householdto-household transmission must be reduced by a factor of 2.

On the contrary, already when m H m W is smaller than but close to 1, the time required for a clump to form may be so long that any realistic population size could be too small to make the exponential phase long enough to observe clumps reaching the end of their infectious period before the depletion of susceptibles in the population starts having a major role in the epidemic dynamics.",

However, the same definition problems arise in quantifying the effects of most of the social distancing control measures implemented during an infection outbreak.",

            "text": "Many other interesting issues should be further explored: first, gaining a clear understanding of the differences between a households-workplaces model, as described in this paper, and other structured population models where the local saturation of susceptibles is not taken into account (e.g. Roberts 2004 Roberts , 2007 Aldis 2005) or is taken into account only for the withinhousehold transmission (e.g. in Becker et al. 2005) ; second, investigating the benefits of a further distinction between schools and workplaces, motivated by a difference in size distributions, transmission parameters, contact rates and other characteristics of the individuals (adult/child), the economic implications of their closure, as well as realistic feasibility of parameter estimation in the two environments (Cauchemez et al. 2008) ; third, exploring how important the presence of workplaces is, in addition to the household structure, in correctly estimating the target of the critical vaccination coverage, as in Becker & Utev (1998) for the comparison between a households model and a model with homogeneous mixing. Furthermore, in order to assess the impact that school and workplace closure might have in an emerging outbreak situation, extensive effort needs to be focused on quick and robust methods for the estimation of the changes in global and household transmission that are likely to occur when the control policy is implemented. Some a priori analysis could be carried out by assuming that the social behaviour in such conditions is similar to what is obtained during school holidays, as in Cauchemez et al. (2008) . However, human behaviour under considerably stressful conditions, such as during an emerging outbreak, is difficult to predict and may turn out to be substantially different from what can be observed during normal holiday time. For this reason, real-time estimation methods remain invaluable tools and much effort should be spent in identifying which data need to be collected and how.",
