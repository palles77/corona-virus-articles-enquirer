            "text": "Escherichia coli phosphofructokinase-2 (Pfk-2) is an obligate homodimer that follows a highly cooperative threestate folding mechanism N 2 4 2I 4 2U. The strong coupling between dissociation and unfolding is a consequence of the structural features of its interface: a bimolecular domain formed by intertwining of the small domain of each subunit into a flattened b-barrel. Although isolated monomers of E. coli Pfk-2 have been observed by modification of the environment (changes in temperature, addition of chaotropic agents), no isolated subunits in native conditions have been obtained. Based on in silico estimations of the change in free energy and the local energetic frustration upon binding, we engineered a single-point mutant to destabilize the interface of Pfk-2. This mutant, L93A, is an inactive monomer at protein concentrations below 30 mM, as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation, dynamic light scattering, size exclusion chromatography, small-angle x-ray scattering, and enzyme kinetics. Active dimer formation can be induced by increasing the protein concentration and by addition of its substrate fructose-6-phosphate. Chemical and thermal unfolding of the L93A monomer followed by circular dichroism and dynamic light scattering suggest that it unfolds noncooperatively and that the isolated subunit is partially unstructured and marginally stable. The detailed structural features of the L93A monomer and the F6P-induced dimer were ascertained by high-resolution hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Our results show that the isolated subunit has overall higher solvent accessibility than the native dimer, with the exception of residues 240-309. These residues correspond to most of the b-meander module and show the same extent of deuterium uptake as the native dimer. Our results support the idea that the hydrophobic core of the isolated monomer of Pfk-2 is solvent-penetrated in native conditions and that the b-meander module is not affected by monomerizing mutations.",

            "text": "Although folding information is encoded within the protein sequence (6) , the success of folding a given polypeptide chain into its proper native state often relies also on the interaction with other biomolecules. Such is the case for obligate oligomers, where subunit stability and protein-protein association are strongly coupled (7, 8) . This is of great importance, because encounter between two or more polypeptide chains after being synthesized by the ribosome must occur to enable folding into the native oligomer. In en-zymes, these obligate complexes also constitute their active forms. Taking into account that in Escherichia coli 81% of its proteome is constituted by oligomers and 36.6% of it corresponding to dimers (9) , determining how folding of obligate oligomers proceeds becomes a key aspect to fully understand their function.",

The protein-protein interface of Pfk-2 is formed by association between the fourstranded b-sheets from each subunit, the so-called small domain ( Fig. 1 A) , and resembles a flattened b-barrel, thus mimicking a compact bimolecular domain (11, 12) . This small domain emerges as a result of a topological discontinuity of the polypeptide chain (13) , thus having four chain crossings with the Rossmann module of the major domain but not with the C-terminal b-meander module (Fig. 1 B) . Both guanidine-HCl (14) and cold-induced denaturation (10) lead to observation of an expanded monomeric species that constitutes an intermediate state of its three-state folding mechanism N 2 4 2I 4 2U, where the first unfolding transition is highly cooperative and occurs concurrently with dimer dissociation (10) . We recently analyzed the local structural changes experienced by Pfk-2 during cold-denaturation using backbone amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) (15) , demonstrating that the expanded monomer species is reached by concurrent dissociation and overall solvent penetration of its hydrophobic core (16) , in line with theoretical predictions (17) . Nevertheless, recent simulations in other proteins that include water-mediated interactions to describe pressure denaturation have shown that these swollen states unfold further in a noncooperative fashion (18) , suggesting that the structural features of these intermediates are highly sensitive to changes in the solvent properties and marginally stable. The fact that the guanidine-HCl and cold-induced intermediate states of Pfk-2 are stabilized by 1.7 and 2.8 kcal/mol, respectively (10) , strongly suggests that this is the case for the isolated monomer of Pfk-2.",

This mutant, L93A, exists as a monomer at high protein concentrations when compared to the wild-type (WT) protein, as seen by analytical ultracentrifugation, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), and it is more compact than the guanidine-HCl or cold-induced monomeric species. The mutant monomer is also fully compatible with the catalytic dimer of the WT protein, as shown by the positive dependence between protein concentration and specific activity and by the induction of dimer formation as a result of the addition of its substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). Chemical and thermal unfolding of this monomeric mutant measured by circular dichroism (CD) demonstrates little or no cooperativity of its transition toward the unfolded state. Finally, we ascertained the local structural features of this mutant by highresolution HDXMS, showing that this species is overall more solvent-accessible than the subunits forming the dimer, being qualitatively similar to the cold-denatured monomeric ensemble, with the exception of the C-terminal residues 240-309 of the b-meander module, which remain unperturbed in L93A.

Analysis of local energetic frustration, which is largely inspired by the principle of minimal frustration (22) , addresses how a given residue or pair of residues in contact in the native state contribute to the stabilizing energy of that structure compared with a scenario where either the identity of the residues (mutational frustration) or the environmental and structural features of the ensemble where the given interaction is established (configurational frustration) are randomized (23) , which can be calculated as described elsewhere (24) . Minimally frustrated interactions are evolved to be strongly supportive of the native structure, and substitutions at these contacts weaken the energy of the folded state. In contrast, highly frustrated interactions actually destabilize the native state and substitutions result in more favorable energies than those of the contact in the native structure. We first analyze the localized frustration of the individual binding partners and then of the native dimer to examine whether a given residue contributes to the stability of the monomer or also to the stability of the dimer (24) . Our goal was to find residues that specifically destabilized the dimer structure without stabilizing or destabilizing the monomeric structure.",

The scattering data were recorded on a Pilatus photon-counting detector, with the magnitude of the scattering vector q \u00bc 4psinq/l within the range 0.01 \u00c5 \u00c01 < q < 0.4 \u00c5 \u00c01 .

The exchange reaction was initiated when 5 ml of protein (initial concentration of WT Pfk-2 \u00bc 30 mM and 90 mM, L93A \u00bc 20 mM) were mixed with 55 ml of deuterated standard buffer. For the experiments in the presence of substrate, an excess of 15 mM F6P was added to the initial protein samples to ensure the presence of 1.25 mM F6P after dilution. The proteins were allowed to exchange at 25 C for 0-5 min. The exchange reaction was then quenched for 2 min at 1 C using an equal volume of a solution containing 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 2.66, 2 M GndHCl. The quenched sample was injected into a 50 ml sample loop, followed by rapid online pepsin digestion at 15 C using a custom-built column made with pepsin-agarose (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Rockford, IL). Peptic peptides were captured on a BEH C18 Vanguard Pre-column (Waters Corporation), separated by analytical chromatography at 1 C (ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18, 1.7 mm, 1.0 \u00c2 50 mm, Waters Corporation) with a gradient of 7-95% acetonitrile in 7 min, where both mobile phases contained 0.2% formic acid.

The mass spectrometer was set in MS-ESI\u00fe mode to collect H/DX data in the mass range 50.000-2,000.000 (m/z), scanning every 0.4 s. Infusion and scanning every 30.0 s of leu-enkephalin (m/z \u00bc 556.277) was used for continuous lock mass correction. For peptide identification, the mass spectrometer was set in MS E -ESI\u00fe mode instead. Peptides were identified and the tandem mass spectrometry fragments were scored using the PLGS 3.0 software (Waters Corporation). Peptides with a score over eight were selected for analysis if their mass accuracy was at least 2 ppm and were present in three independent runs. Deuterium uptake was determined by calculating the shift in the centroids of the mass envelopes for each peptide compared with the undeuterated controls, using the DynamX 2.0 software (Waters Corporation).",

Here, our purpose is to look at the isolated subunit in native conditions through a single-point mutation on the interface, thus leading to destabilization of the quaternary structure of Pfk-2. We performed in silico estimations of the change in free energy due to substitutions of interfacial residues by alanine using the Robetta server (20) , accompanied by analysis of local energetic frustration using the Frustratometer (21) . Local frustration analysis determines whether a given contact between a pair of residues in the native structure supports or conflicts with robust folding, when compared to the same interaction being established by other residues or by the same residues but in other structural environments (24) . We hypothesized that by comparing the local frustration analysis of the dimer to that of the isolated monomer of Pfk-2 (PDB 3N1C), it would be possible to ascertain which interface residues could be mutated without affecting monomer stability but which contributed significantly to dimer stability. The goal then was to identify an interface mutation located in a region with low probability of causing local structure rearrangements, such that the folding stability of the monomeric version of this mutant would remain as similar as possible to the WT protein. As shown in Fig. 1 C, only a few residues from the four-stranded b-sheet that constitute the interface (Fig. 1, A and B) , are predicted to have an effect on the stability of the protein-protein interaction, mainly located on strands b6 and b7 (residues 93-107). Although the largest changes in free energy are predicted by alanine substitution of residues 103-108, the local frustration of this region and of strands b2 and b3 (residues 12-38) appears to be highly dependent on contacts made to an adjacent subunit (Fig. 1 , D and E), thus suggesting that mutation of this region would affect both monomer and dimer stability. Therefore, we chose to mutate residue L93 ( Fig. 1 A) , whose substitution by alanine is predicted to cause a destabilization of the interface of~1 kcal/mol and it is located on a region where local frustration is not dependent on subunit binding.",

As shown in Fig. 2 A, WT Pfk-2 at a protein concentration of 20 mM is a dimer in solution with a S 20,w value of 4.25 S, whereas the L93A mutant is a monomer (S 20,w \u00bc 2.8 S). From the analysis of the sedimentation curves, we obtained the hydrodynamic radius of the observed species, being 3.5 5 0.1 nm for the WT dimer and 2.9 5 0.1 nm for the monomer. These values match the hydrodynamic properties of the L93A mutant determined by SEC after extrapolation to infinite dilution (Fig. 2, B and C) . We also mutated residue V95, to corroborate the validity of the computational strategy being used, demonstrating by SEC that this protein is also monomeric at low protein concentrations (Fig. S1 in the Supporting Material). However, we chose not to work with V95A due to its very low yield and complex purification. To further validate the results obtained for L93A, we performed intrinsic fluorescence measurements of the tryptophan residue W88 from Pfk-2, the only tryptophan residue of this enzyme, which is located on the interface between subunits and accounts for subunit dissociation, showing that the fluorescence intensity of the L93A mutant is lower than the WT protein (Fig. S2) , thus corroborating that the L93A mutant of Pfk-2 is a monomer at micromolar protein concentrations. It is worth noting that the hydrodynamic radius of the L93A Pfk-2 monomer is smaller than the radius of the expanded monomeric intermediate induced by chemical unfolding and by cooling, which are 3.8 5 0.1 nm and 4.6 5 0.3 nm, respectively (14, 16) , but larger than the theoretical value of 2.6 nm calculated for a compact isolated monomer from the crystal structure of WT Pfk-2 (PDB ID 3N1C) using the software HYDROPRO (35) , suggesting that the L93A monomer is somewhat expanded.",

To validate this, we performed SEC and DLS experiments at several protein concentrations, ranging from 0.3 to 120 mM (Fig. S3) . DLS measurements were performed in the same conditions as the sedimentation velocity experiments, i.e., without adding salt, whereas SEC was performed using 0.2 M KCl as recommended by the column's manufacturers. According to these measurements (Fig. 2 C) , the L93A mutant is a monomer at protein concentrations below 30 mM, with an estimated Stokes radius from DLS measurements of 3.1 5 0.3 nm that is within error of the estimated hydrodynamic radius from sedimentation velocity experiments at 20 mM, whereas the WT protein remains as a dimer even at protein concentrations of 0.3 mM according to SEC. Although the estimated radius from SEC at protein concentrations of 35 mM is larger than the value obtained from DLS measurements at 30 mM (Fig. 2 C) , this could be due to the presence of potassium, which is known to bind, stabilize, and enhance the activity of WT Pfk-2 (36). At protein concentrations above 30 mM, the hydrodynamic radius of L93A Pfk-2 is considerably larger, being 3.4 5 0.2 nm at 120 mM according to DLS measurements (Fig. 2 C) . The closeness of this value to the one estimated for the WT Pfk-2 suggest that increasing the protein concentration of L93A Pfk-2 leads to subunit association into the dimer form that corresponds to the native state of Pfk-2. Furthermore, the continuous shift of the SEC profiles upon increasing protein concentrations of the L93A mutant (Fig. S3) suggest a rapid monomer-dimer equilibrium.",

Therefore, we performed kinetic as-says where the final protein concentration used to start the enzymatic reaction was the same (4.3 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 mM), irrespective of the original protein concentration. As expected, L93A Pfk-2 has marginal F6P phosphorylation activity when incubated at a protein concentration of~3 mM (Fig. 2 C; Table 1 ). The catalytic constant of L93A at a protein concentration of 15 mM, which is close to the concentration we used for the SEC and SAXS experiments, is 12 s \u00c01 (Table 1) , which is consistent with L93A largely being a monomer. The enzyme becomes more active as the protein concentration increases and dimer is formed, reaching a maximum k cat of~23 s \u00c01 when the protein concentration is 150 mM (Fig. 2 C) . At this concentration, the turnover number is still about threefold lower than that for the wild type Pfk-2 at all assayed protein concentrations, 68 s \u00c01 (Fig. 2 C) .",

As shown in Fig. 2, A and B , the sedimentation coefficient and the hydrodynamic radius of L93A Pfk-2 increase upon addition of 1 mM F6P, suggesting that this substrate does lead to dimerization of the L93A mutant.

The scattering data shown in Fig. 2 D corresponds to the absolute intensity of L93A Pfk-2 after being irradiated for 30 s in the absence and presence of its substrate F6P. First, the zero intensity I 0 for the protein in the presence of 1 mM F6P is around twofold higher than when the protein is irradiated without substrate, which is consistent with the formation of a dimer upon addition of F6P. The I 0 calculated through the Guinier linearization is 0.013 5 0.001 cm \u00c01 for L93A without F6P and 0.023 5 0.001 cm \u00c01 with F6P (inset, Fig. 2 D) , whereas the I 0 estimated after indirect Fourier transforming the scattering data to obtain the interatomic distance distribution function p(r) for each sample (Fig. 2  E) is 0.011 5 0.001 and 0.021 5 0.001 cm \u00c01 in the absence and presence of F6P, respectively. From the I 0 values in absolute scale, we calculated the molecular mass of L93A with and without F6P as described elsewhere (40, 41) , being 63.7 kDa (58.2 KDa from p(r)) and 36.0 kDa (30.5 kDa from p(r)) for L93A Pfk-2 with and without F6P, thus demonstrating that F6P induces dimerization of this mutant. From the pair distribution function p(r), both the radii of gyration and an ab initio shape model of the monomer and the substrate-induced dimer were obtained. The radii of gyration were 2.80 5 0.02 nm for the monomer and 3.27 5 0.01 nm for the dimer (Fig. 2 E) . These values are in excellent agreement with the hydrodynamic properties of the L93A mutant and of the native dimer of Pfk-2. Although the protein concentration of the scattered sample was low and the scattering intensity for q values larger than 0.2 overlaps the buffer scattering intensities (data not shown), the ab initio shape generated for the dimer fits well with the crystal structure of the native dimer of Pfk-2 (PDB ID 3N1C), having a NSD of 0.94 when superimposed. In the case of L93A without F6P, the shape generated for the monomer is more elongated than the compact monomer extracted from the crystal structure, although its NSD is 0.97. Thus, the hydrodynamic properties and overall shape of the isolated monomer of the L93A mutant suggest that its structure is somewhat compromised, which is covered in the next section.",

This change in secondary structure somewhat resembles the chemical unfolding of the coldinduced intermediate state of Pfk-2, which has a marginal stabilization free energy of 2.8 kcal/mol (10), although a sigmoidal transition was observed in that case. The linear change in the secondary structure content of L93A as a function of GndHCl is also observed when the protein is refolded by dilution (Fig. 3 B) . This change in secondary structure is accompanied by an almost linear increase in the hydrodynamic radius of the protein, from 3.3 5 0.2 nm in the absence of chaotropic agent to 5.9 5 0.1 nm at 1.5 M GndHCl, according to DLS measurements, which is slightly higher than the predicted value of~5.3 nm for a fully unfolded chain of 33 KDa (42) .

To further characterize the structural features of this mutant, we performed HDXMS measurements of the isolated monomer of L93A Pfk-2 and of the F6P-induced dimer. HDXMS allows determination of the exchangeability of backbone amide hydrogens with solvent deuterium after incubation in D 2 O, thus accounting for the solvent accessibility of the protein structure (43) . When the exchange reaction is followed by proteolytic cleavage, HDXMS allows localization of the protein regions that are exchanging (15) . Furthermore, recent development of online pepsin digestion coupled to analytical chromatography and last-generation mass spectrometry allows separation, identification, and analysis of many sequentially overlapping peptides, thus achieving high structural resolution and high protein coverage (33, 44) .",

The resulting monomeric intermediate therein was characterized as expanded and solvent-penetrated throughout the protein structure (16) . Our results presented here show that destabilization of the interface between subunits through the L93A mutation also leads to a monomeric species with larger hydrodynamic radius than expected for a compact subunit (Fig. 2) , lesser secondary structure (Fig. 3) , and higher solvent-accessibility than the well-folded native dimer, thus resembling many of the structural features of the cold-induced intermediate state (Fig. 4) . The concurrence between the cold-induced intermediate state and the L93A monomer provide further evidence that the interface domain and the major domain of Pfk-2 are clearly linked in their folding/unfolding. Moreover, we propose that this coupling between domains is a consequence of the reentrant chain topology of Pfk-2. The small domain of Pfk-2, which associates with the adjacent subunit to constitute the bimolecular interface of the native dimer, emerges as a topological discontinuity (13) , thus reentering and interrupting the chain topology of the Rossmann module of the major domain The coloring scheme goes from no exchange (blue) to 68% uptake (red), which is the maximum uptake observed for the N-terminal residues 1-7 from the L93A Pfk-2 mutant.

It is known that these chain topologies have emerged during evolution to introduce mutual constraints that promote cooperativity (45) . A beautiful example of how chain topology controls cooperativity corresponds to T4 lysozyme, where folding of an a-helical N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain are coupled due to the discontinuous chain connectivity (46) . The release of this chain topology constraint through circular permutation leads to energetic decoupling of both domains, allowing the C-terminal domain to fold independently (45, 47) .",

According to HDXMS, the C-terminal region of the L93A mutant shows small changes in deuterium uptake under native conditions, in comparison to the same region in WT Pfk-2 ( Fig. 4 B) , whereas MALDI-TOF HDXMS analysis of peptide fragments that covered a large portion of the C-terminus of the b-meander of WT Pfk-2 (residues 275-294) showed a significant increase in their extent of exchange as a consequence of cold-denaturation (16) . Therefore, we conclude that the dissociation of the dimer of Pfk-2 in native conditions mainly affects the Rossmann module of the major domain and the small domain, which is linked to the Rossmann module by the reentrant topology of the polypeptide chain (12, 13) , and not the b-meander module, suggesting that the latter does not belong to the folding cooperative unit of Pfk-2. Structurally, this idea is consistent with the fact that none of the chain crossings between the major domain and the interface domain interrupt the chain topology of the b-meander.",

First, deletion of up to 10 residues of the C-terminus of WT Pfk-2, covering the totality of the last C-terminal helix, does not affect folding or function of the dimer of Pfk2, only impeding quaternary packing into the allosterically induced tetramer (48) . Second, the kinetic unfolding of Pfk-2 followed by CD shows a biphasic behavior, which has been argued to correspond to a sequential unfolding mechanism (49) . Although the slow phase has been related to the dissociation and unfolding of the native dimer, because it matches the kinetic unfolding rate determined by intrinsic fluorescence, the fast phase has been associated with structural changes of a region of the protein that is not related to the folding cooperative unit, namely the b-meander. Third, comparative analysis of Pfk-2 and several ADP-dependent archaeal enzymes from the ribokinase superfamily has demonstrated that the b-meander module experiences a topological reor-dering through a noncyclic permutation (50) . The plasticity of the topology of the b-meander along the evolution of this kinase superfamily would be expected if the stability of the folding cooperative unit does not depend on this structural module.",

The resulting monomeric ensembles after applying these perturbations are marginally stable and apparently similar, but exhibit different hydrodynamic radii (10) . In the case of the L93A mutant, the isolated monomer is more compact than the cold-denatured and GndHCl-denatured ensembles. The marginal stability of the isolated subunit, along with the different sizes of these ensembles upon the applied perturbations, suggests that the hydrodynamic features of the isolated subunit of Pfk-2 are strongly dependent on solvent conditions, as demonstrated for the unfolded states of other proteins, such as the C-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9 (51) .",

In fact, most of the central b-sheet that constitutes the core of the structure of Pfk-2 is solvent accessible in the L93A mutant (Fig. 4) . Experimentally, these solvent-penetrated ensembles are usually seen as a result of cold (52) and pressure denaturation (53), although denaturants are also generally considered to facilitate solvation of hydrophobic regions of proteins (54) . Theoretical approaches have been able to evaluate the unfolding of such solvent-penetrated or swelling structures. Recent simulations, where protein native contacts are allowed to be water-mediated to resemble the effect of pressure in proteins, have shown that these ensembles unfold noncooperatively, with a consequent increase in their radius of gyration and loss of compactness (18) . Hence, the noncooperative behavior of the chemical and thermal unfolding of the L93A mutant of Pfk-2 can be understood as a process where a protein, whose hydrophobic core has been already largely penetrated by water molecules, gradually becomes fully unfolded and solvated.",

Addition of F6P leads to substrate-induced dimerization of the L93A mutant (black triangles) with a sedimentation coefficient close to the native dimer of Pfk-2 (open squares). (B) Analytical SEC of L93A Pfk-2 showing that the L93A mutant is a monomer (black circles) with a hydrodynamic radius of 2.9 nm, which can be guided toward formation of a dimer with a hydrodynamic radius of 3.5 nm upon addition of F6P (black triangles). This value is close to the hydrodynamic radius estimated for the native dimer (open squares). (C) Dependence of the hydrodynamic properties and enzyme activity of L93A Pfk-2 on the protein concentration, measured by SEC and DLS. The hydrodynamic radius of the L93A mutant (black circles and triangles) becomes larger upon increasing protein concentrations, suggesting a shift in the monomer-dimer equilibrium, whereas the value of 3.5 nm estimated for the native dimer (white squares) remains constant at all protein concentrations assayed. The increase in hydrodynamic radius of L93A is accompanied by an increase in enzyme activity (open circles), having a k cat that is about threefold lower than the WT enzyme (black crosses) at the highest protein concentration assayed (150 mM). (D) SAXS data of L93A in the absence (open circles) and presence (gray circles) of F6P. The inset shows the linear fitting of q values <1.3/Rg according to the Guinier approximation. The difference in I 0 between both samples is about twofold, consistent with a change in the oligomeric state of L93A. (E) Interatomic distance distribution function p(r) of L93A in the absence (open circles) and presence (gray circles) of F6P. The estimated radius of gyration of the substrate-induced dimer of L93A in the presence of F6P is larger than the monomer, in agreement with SEC and sedimentation velocity experiments. (F) Ab initio shape models of L93A with and without F6P superimposed to the crystal structure of the native dimer and the compact monomer of Pfk-2 (PDB ID 3N1C), respectively.
