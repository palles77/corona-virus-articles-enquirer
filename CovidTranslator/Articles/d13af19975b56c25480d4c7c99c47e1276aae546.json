            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus is the type species of the family Coronaviridae, and is part of the Gammacoronavirus genus (Woo et al., 2009) . Within the Coronaviridae, individual species are able to infect a wide array of animals, including but not limited to humans, dogs, cats, pigs, cows, birds, bats, and whales. IBV mainly infects chickens, and globally causes great economic loss for the poultry industry every year (Saif, 2008) . Although IBV mainly infects the ciliated epithelia in the respiratory tract of chickens and causes respiratory disease, many studies have discovered that IBV can also spread to other organs of the chicken and can cause pathology in other issues, such as alimentary tract, testes, oviduct, and Harderian gland (Bezuidenhout et al., 2011; Raj and Jones, 1997) . Clinical signs include coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, loss of appetite, and reduction in egg laying (Saif, 2008) . In addition to the original Massachusetts serotype, dozens of serotypes and genotypes of IBV have now been detected (Meir et al., 2010) . Many strains can cause major or minor nephritis in both naturally infected or experimentally infected chickens (Lambrechts et al., 1993) .",

In cell culture, while most field strains of IBV can infect primary chicken derived cells (e.g. chick kidney and tracheal cells), no cell lines are generally considered to be susceptible to IBV infection. The exception to this is the Beaudette strain, which is a highly embryo-and cellculture adapted non-virulent virus and can infect cell lines derived from a variety of mammalian species (Saif, 2008) .",

The virus mainly infects respiratory epithelium, but can be also detected in other organs. The functional receptor for the virus has not been found and field strains of IBV do not infect conventional cell lines. Recently, it has been shown that the Ctype lectins DC-SIGN/L-SIGN can promote entry of several coronaviruses. Here we examine whether DC-SIGN/L-SIGN are entry determinants for IBV. We show that by introducing human DC-SIGN/L-SIGN into non-permissive cells, infection by the IBV is dramatically increased. DC-SIGN mediated infection was inhibited by mannan and antilectin antibodies, and was independent of sialic acid levels on the cell. Enhancement of IBV infection also occurred for different serotypes of IBV. Our findings demonstrated that even in the absence of avian-specific receptor, DC-SIGN-like lectins are capable of mediating efficient IBV infection.",

            "text": "tissues. Although the virus was first identified almost 80 years ago, the primary receptor for IBV has not been identified. There was speculation that feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN), which can serve as a common receptor for many Alphacoronaviruses, is a receptor for IBV (Miguel et al., 2002) . This was based in part on the ability of the Ark99 strain of IBV to infect feline kidney cells (Miguel et al., 2002) . However, these studies were not confirmed with additional isolates of IBV and the current view is that APN is not a functional receptor utilized by IBV. There have also been studies showing that the tissue tropism of IBV may be linked to the use of sialic acid as an attachment factor, which is present on cell surface of various tissues (Winter et al., 2006) . In addition, heparin sulfate has been reported as an attachment factor specifically for the Beaudette strain of IBV (Madu et al., 2007) . Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and its closely related Liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (L-SIGN) are calcium-dependent lectins. DC-SIGN was first discovered to be important in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pathogenesis (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000) . This lectin, expressed mainly on dendritic cells, is believed to interact with the HIV-1 surface glycoprotein gp120 and enable capturing and transporting of the virus particle from mucosal infection site to secondary lymphoid tissues (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000) . DC-SIGN is also able to enhance HIV-1 infection in cis as an attachment factor (Lee et al., 2001) . With a similar structure to DC-SIGN, L-SIGN is able to capture HIV-1 in the same manner. Many enveloped viruses such as Ebola virus, hepatitis C virus, and Sindbis virus also have been shown to be interacting with DC-SIGN and/or L-SIGN presumably via interaction with high-mannose glycoproteins on the viral particles (Alvarez et al., 2002; Klimstra et al., 2003; Navarro-Sanchez et al., 2003; Pohlmann et al., 2003) .",

Fig. 1 shows 3T3 (A) or CRFK cells (B) transfected with plasmids expressing DC-SIGN or L-SIGN, or with a control plasmid, and then infected with IBV M41. Cells expressing DC-SIGN or L-SIGN were identified with anti-lectin antibodies. In the absence of lectin expression, we observed no infection with IBV M41. However, in the presence of DC-SIGN or L-SIGN expression, there was a strong correlation of IBV M41 infection in lectin-expressing cells. Fig. 2 shows a quantification of the rescue of IBV infection, in this case using 3T3 and CRFK cells lines stably expressing DC-SIGN, as well as 3T3 and CRFK cells expressing feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN)-which has been previously proposed to be a receptor for IBV. Both 3T3 and CRFK cells expressing DC-SIGN were efficiently infected with IBV M41, whereas there was no apparent rescue of infection in 3T3 or CRFK cells expressing fAPN. Overall, these data strongly suggest that over expression of the C-type lectins L-SIGN or DC-SIGN can act as part of an IBV receptor complex and allow infection of 3T3 or CRFK cells that are otherwise resistant to IBV infection, and further support the idea that fAPN is not a functional receptor for IBV.",

Here we show that two standard cell lines, mouse 3T3 and feline CRFK cells can be efficiently infected by the prototype IBV strain M41 when these cells lines express the C-type lectins L-SIGN or DC-SIGN. Similar rescue of coronavirus infection has also been observed for a range of different coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and feline coronaviruses (Jeffers et al., 2006 (Jeffers et al., , 2004 Regan and Whittaker, 2008) . While it is presently unclear whether L-SIGN and DC-SIGN act as coronavirus attachment factors or bone fide receptors, it is clear that the use of a C-type lectin during coronavirus entry can lead to a major shift in host cell tropism. In the case of IBV, the data presented here show efficient infection of mouse or feline cells, and we expect that infection would not be limited to these cells, but would occur in many cell types. It is possible the utilization of a Ctype lectin may be involved in host range changes that are known to occur with coronavirus infections. Alternatively, use of L-SIGN and DC-SIGN may be involved in the spread of the virus to new cell types or target organs within an infected animal. Although it is evident that IBV viral replication took place in the mouse cell line expressing DC-SIGN, the level of released viruses into the infected cell culture supernatant was not observed, possibly due to defects in virus assembly or release in these mouse cells (data not shown).",

A chicken holmolog of L-SIGN and DC-SIGN has not been identified and so it remains unclear what lectins might be involved in IBV infection in the chicken. We performed BLAST analysis of the chicken genome in an attempt to reveal potential chicken homologs of DC-SIGN. Three lectins, chicken hepatic lectin, the chicken C-type lectin receptor B-NK and chicken B-lec, were identified as the closest homologs to human DC-SIGN by amino acid sequence. Each of these homologs was cloned and expressed in 3T3 cells, but in each case the expressed lectin was unable to rescue infection of IBV (data not shown). The failure to rescue IBV infection may be due to differences in carbohydrate specificity. It is thought that DC-SIGN binds to high mannose and/or fucose residues on the glycoproteins (Guo et al., 2004) including the coronavirus spike protein (Khoo et al., 2008) and the potential chicken DC-SIGN homologs tested may have different carbohydrate-binding specificity. For example, chicken hepatic lectin, which has the highest homology to human DC-SIGN, is known to be specific for terminal Nacetylglucosamine on glycoproteins (Kawasaki and Ashwell, 1977) . Thus a functional equivalent to DC-SIGN remains to be identified in the chicken.",

While feline CRFK cells were rescued for IBV infection by DC-SIGN expression, the same situation occurred for mouse 3T3 cells. Assuming that DC-SIGN is acting in concert with an additional IBV receptor, it appears that both mouse and feline homologs of this receptor are able to act, at least in the presence of high levels of DC-SIGN expression. In addition to testing for the function of over-expressed fAPN, we also cloned and expressed the chicken aminopeptidase N (chAPN). However, like fAPN, this potential receptor failed to rescue infection by IBV (data not shown). Cell lines in culture typically do not express C-type lectins such as DC-SIGN. However we observed that there was is always a very low amount of infection observed in most avian and mammalian cell lines tested, perhaps due to a very low level of Ctype lectin expression or the inefficient use of a homologous (non-chicken) receptor.",

            "text": "While C-type lectins can allow infection of cells by IBV, they are unlikely to be the sole component of the IBV receptor complex in chicken epithelial cells, since we were not able to find a critical role of mannose-binding molecules in the infection of chicken kidney cells by IBV. While in vivo infection with most IBV strains is primarily localized to the respiratory tract, it is known that certain strains can spread to other organs, e.g. kidney and oviduct. This in vivo spread is likely to be highly influenced by C-type lectin expression and distribution, especially in relation to the proposed role of hematopoetic cells, such as macrophages, which often express high levels of C-type lectins and can readily disseminate the virus to distant organs. Nevertheless, the C-type lectin molecules DC-/L-SIGN are able to mediate efficient IBV infection even in the absence of a chicken-specific receptor. Overall, our findings on lectin-virus interactions reveal important parts of the IBV receptor complex, the full intricacy of which remains to be determined.",
