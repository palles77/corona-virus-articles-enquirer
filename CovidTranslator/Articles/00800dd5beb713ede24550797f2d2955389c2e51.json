Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay revealed that basal promoter activity of the mutated LTR was higher than that of the wildtype LTR in Crandell feline kidney (CRFK) cells. The mutated LTR was introduced into an infectious molecular clone of FIV and the clone was transfected into CRFK cells. The virus production of the mutant in the cells was as high as that of the wildtype when determined by the reverse transcriptase activity assay. The growth of the mutant virus obtained from the transfected CRFK cells was examined in feline T lymphoblastoid cell lines (MYA-1 and FeL-039 cells) and primary feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (fPBMCs). The growth was delayed when compared with that of the wild-type virus in all the cells used. Upon examination by polymerase chain reaction, the length of the LTR of the mutant virus was shortened in both MYA-1 cells and fPBMCs. Sequence analysis revealed that the insertion was completely deleted 39 days after infection in the MYA-1 cells.",

Recently, Thompson et al. [29] reported that protein(s) present in the nuclear extract from feline T cells (F422 cells) which are permissive for FIV replication bind to the putative AP-1 and AP-4 binding sites. These findings suggest that the AP-1 in feline cells can bind to the AP-1 binding site in the L T R and is critical for the basal promoter activity of the LTR. Conversely, a m u t a n t virus which lacks the AP-1 and AP-4 binding sites replicated in feline T lymphoblastoid cell lines (MYA-1 and FeL-039 cells) [19] and primary feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (fPBMCs) [17] . These data indicate that the AP-1 and AP-4 binding sites are not necessary for the efficient replication of FIV in feline T lymphocytes.",

            "text": "Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is the etiological agent of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-like disease in cats [24, 32] . FIV is a member of the genus Lentivirus in the family Retroviridae [1] . Lentivirus expression is regulated by virally encoded proteins and by cellular transcriptional factors [2, 20] . Like other lentiviruses, FIV contains the rev gene [12, 25] , however it is not clear whether the virus contains a trans-activator gene [19, 28] . Also in the U3 region of FIV LTR, The CAT constructs under the control of the LTRs of FIV, termed p SPTM 1CATand pSPTM 1A PvCAT, were described previously [10, 19] . They were made by placing FIV LTR from an infectious clone ofFIV TM1 strain (pFTM191CG) [14] and its deleted mutant in front of the CAT gene ofpSPCAT which has both CAT gene and poly A signal [19] . An infectious clone of FIV, termed pSTM2, and a mutated infectious clone which lacks a 31 base pair fragment containing one AP-1 and one AP-4 binding sites, termed pSTM2D2, were described previously [19] . The pSTM2 5' and 3' LTRs were derived from TM2 and TM1 strains of FIV, respectively [19] . After digestion of pSTM2 with Sad, a small fragment which contained the 5' LTR ofpSTM2 was subcloned into the SacI site of p SP72 vector (Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.) and designated as pSTM2LTR. To introduce an oligonucleotide containing multiple AP-1 binding sites into pSTM2LTR, oligonucleotides (5'-CTAGCATGAGTCAGAGTFATGAGTCAGAGT-3' and 5'-CTAGACTCTGA-CTCATAACTCTGACTCATG-3') were synthesized. The oligonucleotides were annealed, phosphorylated by T4 DNA kinase and then ligated into NheI site ofpSTM2LTR, and designated as pSTM2-5APLTR. The sequence of the pSTM2-5APLTR was determined by the cycle sequencing method using dye-terminator supplied by Applied Biosystems (ABI) (Foster City, CA, U.S.A.). To generate pSTM2 (5AP, 5') which has the mutated LTR at the 5' end of the FIV genome ofpSTM2, the SacI fragment ofpSTM2 which contains the 5' LTR was substituted with the SacI fragment ofpSTM2LTR-5AP. To generate pSTM2-5AP which has the mutated LTR on both sides of the genome, a BamHI fragment of the pSTM2 (5AP, 5') was introduced into the BamHI site ofpSTM2-5APLTR. To construct pSTM2-5APCAT, the SacI-NarI fragment ofpSTM2-5APLTR was cloned into the pSPCAT, pVisLTRCAT [7] which is a visna virus LTR CAT reporter plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. J. E. Clements (The Johns Hopkins Univeristy, MD, U.S.A.).",

            "text": "The LTRs of the lentiviruses contain many binding sites for cellular transcriptional factors. FIV, visna virus and caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) possess putative binding sites of AP-1, AP-4 and C/EBP in the LTRs [7, 8, 20] . Of these, AP-1 a n d / o r AP-4 binding sites have been shown to be critical for efficient transcription ofvisna virus [8] and FIV [11, 19, 28] . Although FIV has only one AP-1 binding site in the U3 region of the LTR [14, 26] , visna virus and CAEV have multiple AP-1 binding sites in this region [7] . In addition, we found that the promoter activities ofvisna virus and CAEV LTR are rather higher than that of the FIV LTR in CRFK and SW480 (human colon carcinoma) cells [18] . It has been suggested that the high promoter activities of the visna virus and CAEV are partly due to the multuiple copies of the AP-1 binding sites in the LTRs. In this study, by insertion of multiple AP-1 binding sites adjacent to the original AP-1 binding site in the enhancer region of FIV LTR, significant enhancement of promoter activity was observed in CRFK cells. These data suggested that the insertion is effective at least in these cells. However, the activity of the mutant LTR was still lower than that of visna virus LTR. It might be possible that the high promoter activity of visna virus cannot be attributed only to the multiple copies of the AP-1 binding sites. In contrast to the CRFK cells, in fcwf-4 cells no significant enhancement of promoter activity was observed by the insertion, while by deletion of an AP-1 site together with one AP-4 site out of two, the promoter activity was significantly reduced in the cells. The reason for the discrepancy is unknown at present, however it is possible that the promoter activity in fcwf-4 cells is less dependent on the AP-1 site than the deleted AP-4 site.",

Firstly, the mutant infectious clone was transfected into CRFK cells, and the transient virus production of the mutant was 46 T. Miyazawa et al. compared with that of both the wild-type and the AP-1 deleted mutant. It was expected that the virus production would correlate with the results of the CAT assay. However, no significant difference was observed among these infectious clones. We previously demonstrated the presence of suppressor gene-like activity of FIV which was similar to the nefgene activity of primate lentiviruses and reduced the promoter activity of the LTR [19] . It is possible that the suppressor gene-like activity abrogated the enhancement and reduction of promoter activity caused by the insertion and deletion, respectively.",

The growth of the mutant virus was delayed in MYA-1 cells, FeL-039 cells and fPBMCs. In addition, when the mutated virus harvested from MYA-1 cells at 19 days after infection (Fig. 4) was transferred onto normal MYA-1 and fPBMCs, the growth of the mutant virus had changed to the level of the wild-type FIV in the MYA-1 cells (Fig. 5A) . PCR analysis to amplify the LTR in the cultures revealed that the length of the LTR was shortened to be similar to that of the wild-type virus. Sequence analysis revealed that the insertion of the multiple AP-1 binding sites was completely deleted. These data indicate that the multiple AP-1 binding sites introduced into the LTR have a negative effect on the viral growth activity in feline T lymphocytes, and deletions had occurred by 19 days. Previously we also reported that the AP-1-deleted mutant grew as well as the wildtype in MYA-1 and FeL-039 cells [19] and primary fPBMCs [17] , and concluded that the AP-1 site is not required for the replication of FIV in feline T lymphocytes.",

However, since the AP-1 binding site (TGA[G/C]TCA) contains palindrome sequence [4] , it is possible that multiple AP-1 binding sites introduced in the LTR readily form secondary structures at mRNA level and inhibit reverse transcription from full length genomic RNA to complementary DNA in feline T lymphocytes. Visna virus and CAEV have multiple AP-1 binding sites, however most of the AP-1 sites in both viruses are slightly different from the consensus sequence and are present dispersedly [7, 8] . Therefore it is unlikely that the mRNAs of the U3 region of these viruses form strong secondary structures. Nevertheless, the present study together with the previous studies [17, 18] demonstrates that there is no linear relationship between the promoter activity' of the virus determined by the CAT assay and the viral replication capability, therefore to understand the significance of the enhancer and promoter binding sites regarding the virus life cycle, it is necessary to construct infectious clones which lack other binding sites and to compare the growth rates of the mutant viruses.",

The LTRs of the FIVs were amplified by PCR from extrachromosomal DNAs prepared from MYA-1 cells (MYA-1) and fPBMCs (PBMC) infected with wild-type (pSTM2) or mutant (pSTM2-5AP) viruses. The LTRs were amplified from the MYA-1 cells (Fig. 4A) and tPBMCs (Fig. 4C) collected at 29 and 24 days after infection, respectively, and were shown as MYA-1 and PBMC. The LTRs were also amplified from the MYA-1 cells (Fig. 5A) and fPBMCs (Fig. 5C) harvested at 20 and 24 days after infection, respectively. These cells had been infected with the FIVs derived from the culture supernatants of MYA-1 cells at 19 days after infection and were shown as MYA-1 (2nd) and PBMC.(2nd), respectively. Plasmid DNAs ofpSTM2 and pSTM2-5AP were amplified and used as plasmid controls. The left band is a blank control.
