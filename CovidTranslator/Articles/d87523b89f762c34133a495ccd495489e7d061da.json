The clinical and laboratory characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were described [1, 2] . Cough is one of the most common symptoms at onset of illness [3] .

First, the virus can be shed explosively from the COVID-19 patients' upper respiratory tract into the air through coughing. Second, the duration of virus shedding from nasopharynx was longer.
