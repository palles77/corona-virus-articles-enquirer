Such a structure could result from a two-stage folding process, during which preformed transmembrane helices with independent stability pack without topological rearrangement. This view was originally prompted by experiments in which fragments of transmembrane regions were separately refolded into lipid bilayers and subsequently brought together to yield a functional protein. Other lines of evidence, including the existence of 'one-helix' miniproteins, gene-fusion experiments, helix-driven oligomerization of bitopic proteins, and sequence rearrangements in the course of evolution support this view. Although it forms a useful basis for structural predictions, the limitations of the two-stage folding hypothesis are not clearly defined, and the proportion of integral membrane proteins to which it applies remains uncertain. The papers discussed in the present review illustrate recent progress along these lines.",

There are a number of reasons for this, the most prominent of which are the extreme scarcity of high-resolution IMP structures and the great technical difficulties involved in obtaining direct structural information on the early steps of IMP folding. Because structurally well characterized IMPs are rare, it is both tempting and dangerous to try to extrapolate from these few data general rules which might help in understanding the structure and behaviour of other IMPs. One such attempt at generaliT~tion is the two-stage folding model [1, 2] . This model postulates that the transmembrane region of many IMPs results from the packing of preformed, hydrophobic helices, each of which represents a small autonomous folding domain (see below).",

However, neither the number of these segments that do This review discusses recent results that have a bearing on these questions. Some support the concept of twostage folding, whereas others question its generality. The choice of articles has been guided mainly by the wish to illustrate the progress that has been made on various aspects of the problem. Space constraints mean this review cannot be exhaustive. For this reason, some relevant issues, such as model building and the formation of transmembrane channels by synthetic peptides or by toxins, have had to be largely, if not totally, omitted.",

Hydrophobic environments induce polypeptides to take up periodic secondary structures, a process that is driven by the formation of main-chain hydrogen bonds [7] . For a short peptide (20-30 residues long) spanning the core of a lipid bilayer, this imposes the formation of an a-(or 3m-) helix. The few plasma membrane proteins whose transmembrane secondary structure is known with certainty are made up from bundles of cz-helices [6.]. Closed barrels, composed of [3-sheets rolled upon themselves, can also satisfy main-chain hydrogen bonding in the membrane interior. All bacterial porins whose 3D structures are known are folded into [8-barrels, the lumens of which form aqueous pores (reviewed in this issue, pp 501-507). Two-stage folding does not apply to j3-barrels. Insertion of isolated 13-strands (or pairs of [3-strands) into lipids would be energetically very costly, because of the large number of unsatisfied hydrogen bonds. In keeping with this expectation, it seems that porins fold before, or during, membrane insertion [6.,8].",

Estimates of transfer free energy indicate that each individual transmembrane 0t-helix in known structures [bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and bacterial reaction centres (RCs)], would be more stable when spanning the membrane than in the aqueous phase. Indeed, BR fragments can be inserted into lipid vesicles, where they form transmembrane (z-helices, and can subsequently be reassembled into functional BR molecules (see below). This observation led to the proposal that the native structure of BR and similar proteins results from a two-stage folding process: in the first stage, hydrophobic segments insert into the membrane as ~,-helices; in the second stage, they pack without major rearrangement into an a-helix bundle [1, 2] . In such a model, individual co-helices are considered as autonomous folding domains, able to achieve a defined structure in the absence of the rest of the protein, even though they lack the structural complexity of the larger folding domains found in soluble proteins. The principal arguments in favour of the two-stage model are summarized in Table 1 , together with some caveats.",

The revised topology, which features four a-helices spanning the full thickness of the membrane, has received good support from an examination of the state of the cysteine residues in the proteolipid: the four cysteines predicted to lie outside the cell form disulphide bridges; the four intramembrane cysteines are reduced; and the six cytosolic cysteines are acytated [28-].

As already discussed, it is quite unlikely that unassembled 13-strands of a transmembrane 13-barrel could be forced to face the lipids. As segments M1, M3 and M4 are long and highly hydrophobic, it cannot be excluded that, in a truncated protein, they do insert as a-helices, which would explain the gene-fusion results [21-]. It is very difficult however to envisage how three of the four transmembrane w helices (were they to be present in the unassembled subunits) could subsequently rearrange into five to seven 13-strands upon oligomerization. Alternative possibilities, such as a transient co-existence (in isolated subunits) of a transmembrane helix (M2) with a seven-stranded [3-barrel (that would open to associate with those of other subunits), are almost too embarrassing to mention given the mechanistic problems they would create at the time of insertion and oligomerization.

It is concluded that it is not possible, using this procedure, to identify uniquely how two given helices interact in BR, even though the correct arrangemerit always is among the best models; nevertheless, the rotational positions established by EM and neutron diffraction can be 'postdicted' to better than 20 \u00b0 once the multiple constraints inherent to packing more than two helices into a bundle are taken into account simultaneously.

The alkaline phosphatase (PboA) gene is fused to the 3' end of gene fragments encoding selected individual transmembrane segments of/ac permease and the extramembrane segment that precedes them in the sequence. All except one segment act as export signals, translocating alkaline phosphatase across the plasma membrane into the periplasm. The presence of a transmembrane arginine residue in segment IX reduces its export efficiency. It is suggested that, in the natural situation, insertion of segment IX may be coupled with that of segment X, with which it is thought to interact in mature/z~ permease. The M (previously El) protein of hepatitis virus is synthesized without a signal sequence. Its topology probably features three closely spaced transmembrane or-helices (a, b and c), with a short amino terminus facing the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and a large carboxy terminus facing the cytosol. All combinations of one-or twohelix deletions are generated. The mutant proteins am expressed in a cell-free system, and their topology is examined using glycosylation, protease sensitivity and the binding of antibodies as probes. All proteins insert as expected if the hydrophobic segment(s) adopt the same transmembrane orientation as in the intact protein. The mutam in which helix b has been deleted, which contains conflicting vectoriality signals, ends up with a scrambled orientation. Together with previous experiments of the sort (see also [43\"]), these experiments further demonstrate that topological information is distributed throughout polytopic proteins rather than being determined only by the orientation of the first transmembrane segment. The topologies of the mutant proteins, however, are difficult to explain simply on the basis of the 'positive inside\" rule and it is suggested that additional signals must be involved. In this NMR study, a larger proteolytic fragment (residues 163-231, which encompass BR helices F and G) is found to comprise two orhelical regions connected by a disordered segment. The helices correspond, within a few residues, to the transmembrane helices observed in native BIZ As in a similar study on helices A and B [50\u00b0], there is no evidence that the helices interact in solution, as they do in the native molecule. The effects on dimerization of 282 mutations in the anchoring segment of glycophorin A were examined. Amino acid substitutions which replaced one hydrophobic residue by another revealed the great sensitivity of dimer formation to minor sequence changes. Mutation-sensitive positions occurred with a periodicity of 3.9 residues, suggesting that the two 0t.helices in the dimer form a slightly right-handed supercoil. The region of contact between the two helices is mainly hydrophobic and contains no strongly polar residues, at variance with the postulated contact areas in several tyrosine.kinase receptors.

Structural changes during the photocycle of BR have been studied by EM. The M intermediate of either wild-type BR or the Asp96Gly mutant is trapped by rapid freezing 20 ms following actinic illumination. Difference Fourier projection maps at 3.5A resolution are calculated from electron diffraction pattern intensities. The most prominent changes are observed in the vicinity of helices F and G, consistent with earlier, lower-resolution studies using neutron or X-ray powder patterns.

Torpedo AChR is a heteromeric pentamer homologous to the skeletal muscle AChR analyzed in [38\u2022]. At 9A. resolution, the only secondary structure elements that can be resolved are co-helices. In the bilayer-spanning section, only one transmembrane helix is resolved per subunit, close to the frvefold axis of symmetry. It is presumed to correspond to the putative transmembrane segment M2. It is proposed that the remaining transmembrane segments form a wide I~-barrel surrounding the five central helices.",

Three bacterioopsin fragments are refolded into lipid vesicles and subsequently reassociate in the presence of retinal to regenerate BR. Two of the fragments are synthetic peptides, each containing one of the first two transmembrane or-helices of BR; the third is a flve-helix segment derived from BR by protease digestion. Each of the two synthetic peptides is shown to form transmembrane et-helices before reassociating with the rest of the complex. This is the most telling demonstration to date that an IMP can be built from preformed transmembrane helices. 47. l.aAO M-J, LONDON E, KHORANA HG: Regeneration of the Native Bacteriorhodopsin Structure from Two Chymotryptic Fragments.

This paper and the two that follow [49\"%50*] describe two-dimensional NMR studies of synthetic or proteolytic fragments of bacterioopsin in organic media or detergent micelles. A proteolytic fragment encompassing the first transmembrane segment (helix A, residues 1-36) adopts an or-helical conformation from Pro8 to Met32, which corresponds closely to EM observations on native B1L Interestingly, the conformation of most side chains within the a-helical region is restricted.
