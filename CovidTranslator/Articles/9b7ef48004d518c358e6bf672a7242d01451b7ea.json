It is possible that factors such as latency/reactivation, low level circulation of virus within and/or between herds or reservoir hosts may play a role. Sequencing indicates that virus within herds during an outbreak is identical, but varies both temporally and spatially between outbreaks, suggesting that outbreaks are caused by 'new' virus rather than through latency or the existence of carrier animals (Larsen et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2006; Bidokhti et al., 2012) .",

In order to control these infections better, it is important to clarify further some aspects of their epidemiology and to evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic procedures. To the authors' knowledge, very few longitudinal studies charting the epidemiology of BCV and BRSV infections in cattle herds have been performed. Van der Poel et al. (1993) investigated BRSV infection in six dairy herds over a 1-year period and found a rise in titres but not seroconversion in antibody-positive animals during the summer period. H\u00e4gglund et al. (2006) conducted a 1year serological study of calves in a region of southern Sweden where both BCV and BRSV are endemic and found seroconversion to occur in animals mainly during the winter.",

It is possible that these herds had become newly infected at the previous sampling time but antibody concentrations had not yet reached detectable levels. However, it is likely that either the farmers and/or veterinarians involved in the sampling would have become aware of such new infections. Given how readily both BCV and BRSV transmit within a group of cattle, herds negative in primiparous pooled samples were likely to have been free from the active spread of infection for at least 2 years (corresponding to the age of the cows included). Such a time-span would strongly suggest that a herd converting from antibody negative to positive had recently been introduced to virus rather than being continuously exposed to virus circulating within the herd or being excreted by a carrier animal.",

The one herd in this region that did become seropositive in spring 2009 had a PP value of 21, which was just above the cut-off for negative samples (PP < 20). Such a low value suggests this change was not due to an outbreak of BRSV: it is possible that an animal was included in the sample 'pool' that was not homebred or had been excluded from the herd for some reason. No other samples where the antibody status changed from negative to positive had such a marginal PP value. When the herds from J\u00e4mtland were resampled in 2010, all were antibody negative to BRSV in pooled milk samples from primiparous cows.",

In many cases it was not possible to distinguish primiparous poolnegative from pool-positive herds using the PP value of the BTM sample, but all antibody negative BTM samples had corresponding negative primiparous pool samples for both BCV and BRSV. We concluded that the measurement of antibodies to BCV and BRSV in BTM is an effective method of monitoring herds in areas where virus circulation has been very low or absent for a long time period. However, our findings also suggest that the use of primiparous pooled milk samples is more effective in identifying susceptible herds in the early phases of control programs in endemic areas and for the purposes of animal trading/movement. However, it is crucial that the cows included in the pooled sample are home-bred in order to truly reflect herd infection status.",

Animal trading between low-and high-prevalence regions and between herds of differing antibody status involves the risk of introducing these viruses to potentially highly-susceptible, immunologically-naive cattle. One interesting option is to decrease the incidence of BRSV infection by establishing regional populations of herds certified free of this infection.",

All of the herds in one of the Northern Regions remained free of BRSV transmission during the 3-year study period. Our findings also identified that individual herds in less cattle-dense areas can stay free of BRSV and BCV infection. Between-herd transmission of BRSV and BCV occurred when animals were kept outdoors between late spring and early autumn, which suggests ongoing circulation of the viruses, albeit at a low level, over this time-period. Pooled milk samples from primiparous cows are a convenient way to monitor herd infection status, and can gradually, if freedom from infection is established, be replaced by monitoring of BTM samples. Table 4 Median, mean and standard deviation (STD) for the percentage positivity (PP) of immunoglobulin (Ig) G to bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) measured in pooled milk samples from five primiparous cows (pool) and corresponding bulk tank milk (BTM) samples, stratified by the antibody status of the primiparous pool. Results of negative and positive BTM samples also detailed. Cut-off for negative samples set at PP<20 for pooled, <5 for BTM samples, respectively. ",
