            "text": "Contrary to the established principles of the scientific method, a surprising number of experimentallybased papers submitted to tribology journals and conferences report only one test result for each material pair or set of applied conditions. However, like hardness, yield strength, fatigue life, and other material properties, wear data exhibit varying degrees of repeatability and reproducibility (R/R). Repeatability concerns the replication of experiments within the same laboratory using the same equipment and materials. Reproducibility concerns testing on different equipment, usually at a different location, but using the same lot of specimens and procedures. An important question is: How many replicate measurements are needed to validate trends in wear behavior or to relatively rank materials, surface treatments, or lubricants? Without repeatability information, it is virtually impossible to establish whether reported material rankings or the effects of variables are real or fall within normal data scatter. The purpose of this paper is to characterize and analyze the R/R of wear data that result from a variety of sources, including material homogeneity, choice of units of measure, and choice of experimental variables. Case studies compare R/R for different forms of wear and their test methods, including ASTM standards. Lessons learned are presented for five forms of wear: (1) cavitation erosion, (2) threebody abrasion, (3) solid particle erosion, (4) dry sliding wear, and (5) fuel lubricity using the ball-oncylinder (BOCLE) test. Wear transitions can also affect R/R. These examples provide insights for validating wear models, deciding how many repeated tests to make, and when ranking wear-resistance.",

That raises the question: Why do so many wear paper authors base general conclusions on only one or two tests per set of test conditions? In the author's experience, there are at least seven possible reasons for this shortcoming: 1) Investigators are inadequately trained in the scientific method or may have forgotten that repetition and verification of results are central components of good science. 2) Investigators ignore the fact that wear data, like other physical measurements, exhibit a degree of variability. 3) Experiments may be too costly or too time-consuming to repeat, even though the researcher acknowledges that repetition improves overall confidence in the data. 4) Only a small amount of experimental material is available for testing. 5) Wear is used as a metric to measure the effects of processing, material composition, or surface treatment variables. With emphasis shifted toward processing, there is inadequate attention paid to the true meaning and repeatability of the wear data itself. 6) Business or program deadlines must be met. These include conference paper deadlines, a sponsor's demanding results, project deliverable deadlines, the need to publish, to graduate the next class of students, and a need to move on to the next Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/wear project. Engineers are pressured to get \"quick and dirty results\" and to make rapid decisions on material or lubricant selection. 7) Design of experiments (DOE) approaches to wear measurement define a matrix of parameters like normal force, speed, and temperature, but researchers wrongly assume that only one test per combination of parameters accurately characterizes the net effects of each specific combination.",

            "text": "Physical measurements are subject to a degree of variability. Depending on the type of measurement, the sources of such variability can be attributed to the accuracy and calibration of the measuring instrument, human error, unrealized factors affecting results, influences from the surrounding environment (e.g., contamination, humidity, vibrations), or localized heterogeneities in the materials themselves. As an example of human factors and variability, the author participated in a standards-related, multi-laboratory study to study the variability of Knoop and Vickers microindentation hardness data. Several rounds of measurements were made. In a later round, four carefully prepared materials were indented on the same equipment and then sent to participants for light optical measurement of the impression lengths. It was found that the largest source of scatter in hardness numbers was not variations in the material homogeneity, preparation methods, or in the hardness apparatus, but rather a result of incorrect light-optical microscope magnification calibration and reader judgment of the length of impressions [2] . It was further realized, based on specimens of materials that varied in hardness, that the range of operator data scatter increased as the normal force decreased, especially below 100 g-f (100 mN). The lessons learned from that study was that the sources of scatter in micro-indentation hardness data include the operator, the equipment, and the material itself.",

In 1924, Palmgren introduced an equation that depicted the probability of 10% failure of a sample of roller bearings by rolling contact fatigue, RCF [3] After years of industry use, this approach was critically reviewed by Zaretsky [4, 5] . It was reaffirmed that statistical variations are to be expected in wear life of a given material when tested by a consistent procedure, but more importantly, that factors other than contact fatigue can also affect wear and roller bearing life. Therefore, any approach that assumes that failure is exclusively by RCF (in contrast with corrosion, misalignment, and other possible root causes) can produce misleading conclusions. Microindentation hardness and RCF data are but two examples of unanticipated sources of variability in material behavior even when tests are conducted very carefully.",

The reproducibility of wear data is important for those developing standard test methods, those whose jobs involve quality control of a manufactured product or material, and commercial firms who buy products on the basis of wear or durability requirements. In the latter case, the customer may test some fraction of the products he or she buys in order to ensure that the durability data from the supplier matches that of the delivered products when tested under similar conditions. Depending on the situation, repeatability and reproducibility (R/R) may serve different purposes in scientific studies, materials engineering, and manufacturing.",

Basic statistics textbooks and handbooks provide formal definitions for these terms, but the concept of precision and bias can be summarized graphically. Fig. 1 utilizes shaded areas (not one unique value) to represent the wear data range expected for a given type material when subjected to specific contact conditions and measured properly. The average of that behavior is shown by a star shape in the center of the shaded areas. Individual test results are depicted as open circles. When more than one test is done, the average of those results (in this example, 6 tests) is shown by a cross. Case A shows an individual result that falls outside the true range of wear behavior. Case B shows when a result falls within it. Case C depicts six tests whose results are widely dispersed while Case D illustrates six test results that are closely clustered (more precise). Case E shows that while the results in Case D are precise, they are not accurate, and therefore, are considered to be biased. Experimentally, bias can be caused by a number of factors, such as an undetected error in an calibration of load or some other applied variable that skews test results. Even if a digital read-out or a data output is highly precise (many decimal places), its accuracy can be incorrect. Case F shows both high precision and high accuracy. Note that the average for the six experiments in Case F is very close to the average of the range in true wear behavior for that material. When only one wear test is done for a given set of imposed conditions and materials, it is not possible to determine its degree of precision or its bias.",

German DIN standard 50321 lists 15 different measures for wear [12] .

The ASTM G76 test [14] is used to measure the resistance of materials to impingement by airborne solid particles (50 mm alumina particles) normal to a surface at a velocity of 30 \u00fe/ \u00c0 2 m/s. Those who use it routinely have commented that it is a particularly severe test and can erode most structural materials. Inter-laboratory erosion test data for three steels and from five participating laboratories (4-10 replicates per laboratory) are given in the standard. These are summarized in Table 3 where the units of wear and standard deviation are in 10 \u00c0 3 mm 3 /g of erodant. Note that in two cases, the velocities are higher than the standard's recommended 30 m/s. In all three sets of data, the reproducibility among the five laboratories was worse than was the average repeatability within each laboratory. That general trend is often observed when comparing within-laboratory to between-laboratory data. For the AISI 1020 at 30 m/s, reproducibility was about 1.7 times greater than its repeatability but when the velocity increased to 70 m/s, the difference between repeatability and reproducibility was nearly a factor of 5 worse. The first lesson from this is that the choice of wear testing conditions (such as impingement velocity in erosion) can significantly affect the degree of agreement between wear data obtained in different laboratories.",

A change in the imposed test conditions, velocity in this case, may have a smaller effect on the repeatability of the data than it has on the overall magnitude of the wear rate.

Results of a short study that compared three methods for measuring wear on block specimens were reported earlier [11] , but can be used to illustrate differences in repeatability. A series of four wear tests were conducted using a CDA 638 bronze (95 wt% Cu, 2.8 wt% Al,1.8 wt%Si, 0.4 wt% Co) block sliding dry on an AISI 52100 test ring at 10 N load, 0.2 m/s sliding speed, and for 1 km sliding distance in air. Wear was measured independently in three ways: (i) by mass loss converted to volume using density, (ii) from measured scar width by light optical microscope, and (iii) from measured scar depth by profilometry, the latter two being converted to volume by assuming a cylindrical scar geometry with a radius of curvature equal to that of the test ring. Fig. 4 summarizes the results of these four tests and three methods of measurement. Estimates of volume obtained from weight loss were consistently lower than other measures used for wear volume. Were it not for one anomalous measurement, scar width and depth would be in very close agreement. In fact, three of the scar width-based measurements had a close grouping. The central question remains however: What is the accurate (correct) wear volume of each scar? Unfortunately, direct volume measurements using techniques like scanning mechanical profiling instruments and the like were not available, so a bias for the data obtained using these three methods could not be established. However, the lessons learned from this work are (i) that wear rates obtained using different methods to obtain volume in different studies should not be confidently compared, (ii) that weight loss data seem to given lower wear than dimensional measurements when converted to volume. Note that the weight conversion assumes that the density was correct for the block material, and that all the wear debris was that material (not oxides that might have a different density). For better or worse, the pin-on-disc test method is one of the most common methods employed in sliding wear studies. A recent review of papers submitted to Wear during a six-week period in the spring of 2016 revealed that 31.5% of those papers involved use of a pin-on-disc test method [15] . Of those papers, nearly 37% of them claimed to be using ASTM standard test method G99 [16] . Unfortunately, a significant portion of those papers were declined because the authors failed to justify the reason for selecting that test method, did not justify the choice of the sliding partner material or applied testing parameters, or importantly for the current discussion, failed to conduct sufficient replicate tests to confirm their conclusions. Any archival experimentally-based paper should include consideration of the repeatability of the data used to justify its primary conclusions or any modeling efforts contained in that work.",

Involving over 30 participating laboratories in seven countries, pin on disc test were conduced using both alumina and bearing steel (AISI type 52100). Combinations involved the four conditions of ball/disc as follows: steel/steel, ceramic/steel, steel/ceramic, and ceramic/ceramic using one set of sliding conditions (10 N, 0.1 m/s, 10 mm ball diameter, 1 km sliding distance, ambient temperature). From 3 to 5 tests were done for each set of materials and conditions in each laboratory. Wear scar width on the disc did not prove a satisfactory measure for all combinations, but ball scar size data can be compared. For this discussion, a subset of results for steel/steel (known as VAMAS Kit 1) and steel/ceramic (known as VAMAS Kit 3) are presented in Table 4 . Table 5 summarizes the repeatability and reproducibility of the wear data. As in Case Study 3 for erosion data, the within laboratory variation for wear was less than the between laboratory results. One lesson learned here is that for these materials and conditions, measuring the system wear rate by the slope of the displacement versus sliding distance curve has much higher test-to-test variability than simply measuring wear scar diameter after the test. Like the example for cavitation provided in Case Study 1, the choice of sliding wear measurement metric affected the repeatability of the results.",

Using selected data from Wallbridge and Dowson [20] , the percent difference between using a simple average and using the more rigorous log-normal distribution is shown in Table 6 . Fortunately, no significant error was introduced by simply averaging the wear data and compared with a more rigorous a log-normal analysis procedure. Yet, the conclusions of the work take some issue with that assumption and state: \"Wear factors show considerable scatter, often over several orders of magnitude, even when experimental conditions are unchanged.\" Furthermore: \"Scatter in wear factors for ceramic, polymers, and metals can be well-described by a lognormal distribution, which suggests a large number of low wear factors and a few higher ones.\" If this latter assertion is true, then reporting wear factors based on measurements from only one or two sliding experiments does not adequately sample the behavior of a material pair. In fact, if most results tend to fall at the lower end of an asymmetrical distribution, but if larger values in the tail of distribution are still possible (what could happen, even if unlikely), then for this reason alone, tribo-component designers should include higher factors of safety when selecting materials based on experimentally-measured wear factors. Unfortunately, comprehensive studies of wear factor variability such as that of Wallbridge and Dowson are rare, and it cannot be assumed that all sliding wear data fits log-normal distribution. Therefore, that study only indicates that it is possible that wear data will exhibit other than a normal distribution, and it reinforces the need to conduct multiple repetitions.",

It can be said that the results of a wear or friction test cannot be truly understood without an understanding of the test method itself. The final example concerns the development of ASTM D5000 [21] a widely-used standard in which the diameter of a wear scar produced by a ball sliding on a rotating cylinder is used to evaluate the relative lubricity of aviation fuels. Introduced in the 1960s, the geometry and purpose of the ball-on-cylinder lubricity evaluator gives the test its acronym: BOCLE. One important concern is whether scar size measurements are sufficiently precise (sensitive) and repeatable to be capable of distinguishing the subtle effects of various fuel additives or external contaminants. A 2014 report by the non-profit Coordinating Research Council Ltd. (USA) [22] describes the BOCLE test and twelve methods that have been used to assess lubricity and a tendency for scuffing in fuel system components. Among the extensive results, there was a set of data from a survey of BOCLE test results from samples taken in four regions of the world. Results from this study led Rolls-Royce Ltd. to support following a British Defense Standard to establish testing norms for the lubricity of aviation fuels.",

A round-robin (interlaboratory testing) program, described by Lacey [24] later established that tests performed at 10% relative humidity (RH) in the test chamber had higher precision than those performed at 50%RH, and a comparison with fuel pump wear severity ratings could be made based on a critical BOCLE scar diameter of 0.62 mm for maximum acceptable pump wear. The BOCLE test was later extended to measure the scuffing characteristics of the fuels. The test fluid was placed in a reservoir at 50% relative humidity with a half-immersed rotating polished AISI 8720 steel cylinder approximately 50 mm in diameter. A 12.7 mm diameter ball of AISI 52100 steel was pressed against it with increasing load until a change in friction (friction coefficient exceeded 0.175) and wear is observed. The minimum load to produce that transition was used as a guide to the scuffing load capacity in a fuel injection system. Like the earlier work by Biddle et al. [23] , one lesson learned was that repeatability in scuffing load data was highly dependent on the surface roughness of the cylinder specimen (test ring). If the root mean square roughness (R q ) was much above 0.2 mm, there was little difference in results for three test fuels but when the ring was polished to about R q \u00bc0.04 mm the difference in fuels was optimized. Using that method of specimen preparation, a series of BOCLE scuffing tests (ASTM D5001, Procedure D, 10% RH), was conducted to establish the repeatability within one laboratory versus the reproducibility between three laboratories. The lessons learned were that two factors (ring surface finish and test chamber relative humidity) needed to be controlled in order to improve the sensitivity, repeatability, and reproducibility of a sliding wear test method to usefully measure the lubricity and scuffing characteristics of steel in aviation fuel environments.",

For example, if a large pore, inclusion, recrystallized zone, or clump of hard particles comprises a significant fraction of the wear scar, then those features can disproportionately affect the wear within that area. The positioning of the specimen in the testing apparatus may expose such heterogeneities in the wear location. This concern is analogous in some ways to the Indentation Size Effect (ISE) in hardness testing [25] . When a hardness test is used on a composite material, the amount of material that is deformed by the indenter can be comparable to the sizes of features such as second phases, pores, and additive particles. Analogously, when one uses a small, laboratory-scale tribometer with a contact area size the order of a few mm 2 , he or she in essence samples only a small volume of material relative to the bulk, and conclusions about wear resistance are dependent on only a tiny sample of material worn away. A comparable Wear Area Size Effect (WASE) can result in data scatter if there are microstructure and compositional variations within the material being worn away.",

Well-known transitions include running-in and changes in wear rate due to the wear-through of coatings. Erosive wear, with its incubation period is another example [9] . Changes in wear rate have been taken into account in multi-stage models (e.g., [30] ) and were discussed at the 2015 Wear of Materials conference (e.g., [31] ). Therefore, when measuring wear, one needs not only consider the repeatability of measurements, but also the repeatability of wear transitions. If transitions are known to occur, tests to determine nominal wear behavior should not be conducted too near the boundaries of those transitions in parameter space.

A tribosystem that is prone to transitions must consider the period of time spent at each stage of wear life. As a simple example for sliding wear, consider a tribosystem operating at constant load P and velocity v in which the first period involves wearing through a coating (t 1 ) and the second, wearing down into the substrate (t 2 ). If the wear rate of periods 1 and 2 (W 1 and W 2 , respectively) are assumed to be linear with time, then as a first approximation, the wear volumes for each stage (V 1 , V 2 ) are additive, then:",

For simplicity, consider two cases using the hypothetical values in Table 7 . Three cases, all adding up to 3600 s (1 h) total time are shown and the results plotted in Fig. 7 . The applied load, velocity, friction coefficients for each stage, and wear factors for each stage remain the same, but the transition point between stage 1 to stage 2 can cause a significant difference in the wear factor if it is calculated by dividing the total volume by the sliding distance and normal force. The difference produced by changing the period of the first stage from 30 s to 1200 s in this example resulted in nearly a 50% difference in the apparent wear factors (shown in Fig. 7 legend) . Therefore the need to account for wear transitions can significant affect the repeatability and reproducibility of results. ",

            "text": "Like other physical measurements, wear data exhibit a degree of variability. Repeatability and reproducibility (R/R) reflect the variability from test-to-test in a laboratory and from laboratory-tolaboratory respectively. Five case studies were used to illustrate the insights to be gained and the uses for R/R data. One can summarize the lessons learned from such studies are as follows: 1) Cavitation. In cavitation erosion testing of three metals using ASTM G32, the wear ranking and the test-to-test variability depended on the choice of wear metric used. Maximum erosion rate, for example, ranked materials in a different order of merit than did incubation period, but the incubation period had the highest percent coefficient of variation (CoV) than did other methods of measurement. The lesson here is that metrics used to measure wear can affect the ranking and repeatability of the results. 2) Three-body abrasion. When comparing different procedures for dry sand/rubber wheel abrasion testing of stainless steel using three different procedures in ASTM G65, there was similar CoV despite the fact that the cumulative wear volume differed by a factor of four between the three procedures. One lesson from this is that magnitude of wear produced by different test procedures did not significantly affect the repeatability of the data. Making tests more severe to help discriminate between material behavior can be done without compromising the data repeatability. 3) Solid particle erosion. In solid particle erosion tests (ASTM G76) of two different steels, repeatability was worse when the particle velocity used in testing was increased. For a mild steel (AISI 1020), increasing velocity by a factor of about 2.3 times, increased the wear rate by a factor of about 10 times; however, it only worsened the repeatability of the results by a little more than 2 times. Therefore, increasing test severity does not proportionately decrease repeatability. 4) Dry sliding wearblock-on-ring. When computing wear volume for four duplicate tests of a bronze block on a rotating steel ring based on (i) weight loss, (ii) wear depth, or (iii) scar width, weight loss consistently underestimated the wear volume compared with other methods. The precision was similar for weight loss and scar depth, but scar width had one anomalously high datum that prevented it from otherwise displaying quite good precision and comparing well with volume computed using scar depths. 5) Dry sliding wearpin-on-disc. Measuring cumulative wear continuously by displacement sensors led to much higher variability than simply measuring the pin wear scar after testing. Repeatability in a large number of international pin-on-disc tests using steel/steel and steel/ceramic couples was \u00fe/ \u00c0 14% but the reproducibility was as high as \u00fe /\u00c0 38%. Therefore, more repetition is needed for dry pin on disc tests to confidently measure the wear of materials. Furthermore, as pointed out in a comprehensive study of multiple pin-on-disc tests, if enough wear rate measurements are made, the wear rates tend to fit a log-normal distribution in their frequency of occurrence. 6) Lubricated wear as a measure of fuel lubricity. The ball-on-cylinder lubricity evaluation (ASTM D5001) test was introduced in the 1960s to measure lubricity of aviation fuels. Concerns of R/R were addressed over years of development and applied to conduct worldwide surveys of fuel lubricity. Effect of test chamber humidity and the preparation of specimens to an optimum roughness helped improve test consistency. Results produced international aviation fuel quality standards.",

This has implications for standards development as well as agreeing on product acceptability test methods used by the producer and the user of the product. One can increase repeatability on one's laboratory without necessarily assuming that the results obtained will agree better with those from another laboratory. 2) Wear transition effects. A lack of repeatability of the transitions in wear as a function of contact duration can result in significant scatter in the wear rates calculated using the total wear volume measured at the end of the tests.",

Absent other information, conducting at least three tests per set of conditions is suggested. Since the factors that influence the wear of materials are complex, basing general conclusions on only one test result per set of variables is inappropriate. Renewed attention to R/R, precision, and bias of wear data will likely increase the quality of published wear research and wear model validation. It would also promote engineering confidence in wear studies whose primary goal is to compare or to select materials.",
