Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the leading cause of death beyond the neonatal period in children under five years of age worldwide. 1 Historically, bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type B have been noted as predominant etiologies; 1-3 however, respiratory viruses are frequently implicated as primary causes as well. A recent study conducted in the U.S. found that respiratory viruses were much more common in children hospitalized with pneumonia than bacteria, with at least one virus detected in 65% of enrolled children. 4 A multicenter study conducted in four developing countries also noted that even though Streptococcus pneumonia was associated with increased risk of pneumonia deaths, respiratory viruses were frequently associated with severe, hypoxic pneumonia. 5, 6 Earlier studies have estimated that there were 66,000-199,000 RSV-related deaths in 2005 and 28,000-111,5000 influenza-related deaths in 2008 in children under five, however, these systematic reviews did not include countries in the Middle East due to paucity of population-based studies in the region. 7, 8 The seasonality of respiratory viral diseases other than RSV and influenza and their overall burden in in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) also remain poorly defined. 9 Additionally, prior published viral surveillance studies from the region have been limited by their retrospective nature, the use of convenience samples over short time periods, and the lack of use of modern molecular techniques such as real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 10, 11 Thus, the true burden and severity of virus-driven ARIs in Middle Eastern children are less defined.",

The most common diagnoses were bronchopneumonia, suspected sepsis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and pertussis-like cough. Only one-fifth of the children enrolled had no virus detected. Consistently, during each of the three winter seasons, ~95% of children hospitalized during winter months tested positive for a virus, with RSV and HRV being the most common viruses identified. Both RSV and HRV rates were higher than expected compared to US-based studies. 17, 22, 23 Specifically, RSV rates were similar to rates from Turkey, Norway, and Austria 24-28 ; higher than the US and Netherlands; 22, 29 and lower than UK, Spain, and Denmark. [30] [31] [32] [33] Rates of influenza, HMPV, and PIV1-3 in our cohort were similar to US reports [34] [35] [36] [37] . Our estimates of the burden of influenza, HRV, HMPV, PIV 1-3, and RSV fill a gap in knowledge from the Middle East. 7, 8 Hospitalized children who were virus-negative were more likely to be younger, febrile, and symptomatic with non-respiratory symptoms. Moreover, the overall illness severity of virus-negative children was greater than those with a confirmed viral cause, with more frequent suspected sepsis, seizures, ICU admission, and/or mortality. In contrast, virus-positive children were more likely to present with severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) as indicated by higher frequency of cough and shortness of breath, wheezing, flaring, and cyanosis on exam, and increased oxygen therapy requirement. These clinical differences were dramatic, and may serve as helpful clinical predictors of likely viral diagnosis prior to the availability of more definitive laboratory findings. In addition, 68% of the children who died had at least one respiratory virus detected, noting the association of severe disease with viral detection in these children. Since antibiotic use was nearly universal in children with positive detection of respiratory viruses, targeted interventions for antibiotic stewardship may also be warranted.",

Interestingly, the clinical presentations of RSV and HMPV were indistinguishable, other than age: HMPV only children were older. A surveillance study of RSV-positive children in India found the presence of cough, fast-breathing, crepitation, and hypoxia to be independent predictors of RSV infection. 38 Durani et al. found the combination of cough, wheezing, and retractions to be good predictors of RSV infection. 38, 39 Our study also found cough to be a strong predictor for the presence of virus, including RSV. In addition, the RSV-positive children in our study were more likely to require oxygen therapy, suggesting these children presented with more severe LRT disease. We also documented RSV being more severe than other viruses in a previous pilot study. 14 Therefore, if preventive measures such as vaccines become available for RSV, Jordanian children would benefit greatly.",

Universally, younger age, UMC, and the diagnosis of pneumonia were associated with all five illness severity markers. Lack of breastfeeding was associated with all severity markers except for MV. Therefore, the promotion of breastfeeding is an important public health intervention for reducing the severity of respiratory illnesses. Our study found that lower vitamin D levels were associated with longer LOS and higher probability of oxygen use. Two studies identified an association between lower infant vitamin D levels and increased risk of ARI, and one study found lower levels of vitamin D in children admitted into the ICU with bronchiolitis or pneumonia compared to those admitted to the wards. [40] [41] [42] Observational evidence supports further interventional studies to determine if vitamin D supplementation could reduce respiratory illness severity in this population. A principal strength of our study was its basis of over three full years of surveillance data from a public hospital serving the poor and lower middle class children of a large city in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region. Prior to this study, very few large prospective studies of respiratory viral diseases of children have been completed in this setting. Our ongoing surveillance enabled us to test samples during the time of the first MERS-CoV outbreak in 2012, confirming that none of the children in this study were admitted with MERS-CoV. 43 Our state-of-the-art molecular diagnostics give one of the best assessments to date of respiratory viral etiologies of hospitalized children in any MENA nation. Limitations included having only five days of surveillance per week, though we did weighted analysis in our population burden estimates to adjust for missing days. Also, we did not test for all respiratory viruses (e.g., parainfluenza 4, non-MERS coronaviruses), so viral burden is underestimated. Lastly, this study is limited to children from low-and middle-income population, and thus is not generalizable to the entire population of Jordan.",

A recent study conducted in the U.S. found that respiratory viruses were much more common in children hospitalized with pneumonia than bacteria, with at least one virus detected in 65% of enrolled children. 4 A multicenter study conducted in four developing countries also noted that even though Streptococcus pneumonia was associated with increased risk of pneumonia deaths, respiratory viruses were frequently associated with severe, hypoxic pneumonia. 5, 6 Earlier studies have estimated that there were 66,000-199,000 RSV-related deaths in 2005 and 28,000-111,5000 influenza-related deaths in 2008 in children under five, however, these systematic reviews did not include countries in the Middle East due to the paucity of population-based studies in the region. 7, 8 The seasonality of respiratory viral diseases other than RSV and influenza and their overall burden in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) also remain poorly defined. 9 Additionally, prior published viral surveillance studies from the region are limited by their retrospective nature, the use of convenience samples over short time periods, and the lack of use of modern molecular techniques such as real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 10, 11 Thus, the true burden and severity of virus-driven ARIs in Middle Eastern children are less defined.",

The most common diagnoses were bronchopneumonia, suspected sepsis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and pertussis-like cough. Only one-fifth of the children enrolled had no virus detected. Consistently, during each of the three winter seasons, ~95% of children hospitalized during winter months tested positive for a virus, with RSV and HRV being the most common viruses identified. Both RSV and HRV rates were higher than expected compared to US-based studies. 18, 23, 24 Specifically, RSV rates were similar to rates from Turkey, Norway, and Austria [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] ; higher than the US and Netherlands; 23, 30 and lower than UK, Spain, and Denmark. [31] [32] [33] [34] Rates of influenza, HMPV, and PIV1-3 in our cohort were similar to US reports [35] [36] [37] [38] . Our estimates of the burden of influenza, HRV, HMPV, PIV 1-3, and RSV fill a gap in knowledge from the Middle East. 7, 8 Hospitalized children who were virus-negative were more likely to be younger, febrile, and symptomatic with non-respiratory symptoms. Moreover, the overall illness severity of virus-negative children was greater than those with a confirmed viral cause, with more frequent suspected sepsis, seizures, ICU admission, and/or mortality. In contrast, virus-positive children were more likely to present with severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) as indicated by the higher frequency of cough and shortness of breath, wheezing, flaring, and cyanosis on exam, and increased oxygen therapy requirement. These clinical differences were dramatic and may serve as helpful clinical predictors of likely viral diagnosis prior to the availability of more definitive laboratory findings. In addition, 68% of the children who died had at least one respiratory virus detected, noting the association of severe disease with viral detection in these children. Since antibiotic use was nearly universal in children with positive detection of respiratory viruses, targeted interventions for antibiotic stewardship may also be warranted.",

RSV only children were more likely to present with cough and shortness of breath; have flaring, wheezing, and cyanosis on physical exam; and less likely to present with fever, diarrhea, and seizures compared to other respiratory viruses. Interestingly, the clinical presentations of RSV and HMPV were indistinguishable, other than age: HMPV only children were older. A surveillance study of RSV-positive children in India found the presence of cough, fast-breathing, crepitation, and hypoxia to be independent predictors of RSV infection. 39 Durani et al. found the combination of cough, wheezing, and retractions to be good predictors of RSV infection. 39, 40 Our study also found cough to be a strong predictor of the presence of virus, including RSV. In addition, the RSV-positive children in our study were more likely to require oxygen therapy, suggesting these children presented with more severe LRT disease. We also documented RSV being more severe than other viruses in a previous pilot study. 14 Therefore, if preventive measures such as vaccines become available for RSV, Jordanian children would benefit greatly.",

Therefore, the promotion of breastfeeding is an essential public health intervention for reducing the severity of respiratory illnesses.

Prior to this study, very few large prospective studies of respiratory viral diseases of children have been completed in this setting. Our ongoing surveillance enabled us to test samples during the time of the first MERS-CoV outbreak in 2012, confirming that none of the children in this study were admitted with MERS-CoV. 44 Our state-of-the-art molecular diagnostics give one of the best assessments to date of respiratory viral etiologies of hospitalized children in any MENA nation. Limitations included having only five days of surveillance per week, though we did weighted analysis in our population burden estimates to adjust for missing days. Also, we did not test for all respiratory viruses (e.g., parainfluenza 4, non-MERS coronaviruses), so the viral burden is underestimated. Lastly, this study is limited to children from low-and middle-income population seeking care at a single health facility in Amman, and thus is not generalizable to the entire population of Jordan.",
