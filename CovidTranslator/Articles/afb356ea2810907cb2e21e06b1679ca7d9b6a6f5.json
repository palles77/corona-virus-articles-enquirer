However, this study did not include preterm infants with or without BPD. Both pCHSPCs, also referred to as circulating progenitor cells, as well as late-outgrowth endothelial colony-forming cells, are decreased in the cord blood of preterm infants who later develop moderate or severe BPD (13, 14) . Together, these findings suggest that early disruptions in the number and function of angiogenic progenitor cells, possibly by maternal complications of pregnancy known to be associated with BPD risk, may lead to impaired development of the pulmonary vasculature and sustained impaired gas exchange in preterm infants with BPD.",

Given the spectrum of disease severity among infants with severe BPD (as determined by the currently accepted diagnostic criteria), novel methods such as these will help identify preterm neonates more accurately, permit targeted therapies for the most severely affected infants, and provide quantitative evidence of the efficacy of these interventions in young children after preterm birth (16). n",

            "text": "Rhinoviruses are ubiquitous respiratory pathogens that have coevolved with humans for millennia. Although historically associated with benign conditions such as the common cold, it is now appreciated that human rhinoviruses (HRVs) contribute to the pathogenicity of several major respiratory illnesses (1-7). Two recent surveillance studies identified HRV as the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in U.S. adults and the second most common in U.S. children (8, 9) . An extensive body of literature implicates HRV as a leading precipitant of asthma exacerbations, and mounting evidence suggests that recurrent HRV infection drives chronic airway remodeling and primary disease development in asthma (2) . HRV is also the leading viral precipitant of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and the most frequently isolated virus in patients admitted to intensive care units with severe lower respiratory tract infection (1, 6, 7) . The broad range of disease states associated with HRV may reflect a multifactorial contribution to pathogenesis involving clade-specific virulence, interactions with airway microbial communities, and the host immunologic response (7, 10, 11) . High-sensitivity molecular diagnostics have not only established a role for HRV in severe respiratory illness but also revealed that asymptomatic individuals can incidentally harbor HRV in their airways (12, 13) . This has led many clinicians to question the value of a positive HRV polymerase chain reaction assay, as detection of virus may not equate to clinical significance (13) . Given the wide spectrum of respiratory conditions and disease severity associated with HRV, this lack of clarity poses a significant diagnostic dilemma. There is a need for precision assays to delineate the significance of airway HRV and allow for efficient triage and patient care.",

This transcriptional signature endures across a spectrum of illness severity and includes gene expression alterations typical of the viral host response.

            "text": "The prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is increased in older people. Although estimates vary considerably due to the diagnostic criteria applied and methodology used, the heterogeneity of older populations also often includes comorbidity. The mechanisms for the age-related increase in SDB include a reduction in pharyngeal muscle function (1) and upper airway reflex sensitivity (2) in older people. This is in addition to age-related differences in pharyngeal morphology, including a decrease in the size of the upper airway lumen in older people (3), associated with an age-related lengthening of the pharyngeal airway (4) and a descent of the hyoid bone (5) . This leads to increase in airway resistance and a predisposition to airway collapse (6) , with the critical closing pressure being lower in older people than in younger people, independent of body mass index (1) .Interestingly, the central control of breathing is relatively stable in older people (7), although arousal frequency increases with age and the genioglossus response to hypoxia is reduced (8) , as is the ventilatory sensitivity to hypercapnia measured during wake and sleep (9) . Increased arousal rates lead to hyperventilation and relative hypocapnia, which can promote respiratory instability if arterial PCO 2 falls below the hypercapnic apneic threshold.The anatomical and physiological predisposition for developing SDB with increasing age does matter because, as May and colleagues (pp. 783-791) have shown in this issue of the Journal, SDB, and in particular, indices of central sleep apnea (CSA) were associated with an increased risk for atrial fibrillation (AF) (10) . Thus, their findings point to SDB in older people being a potential target to modify the pathophysiological consequences of aging (11) .In another prospective cohort (12) , 939 older patients (>65 yr) with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were followed for 69 months. The authors of this study found that patients with untreated severe OSA had increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. When the cohort was further divided, patients with severe disease who",
