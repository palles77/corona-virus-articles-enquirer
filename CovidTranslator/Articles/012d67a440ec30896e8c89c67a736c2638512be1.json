            "text": "Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) infections are generally manifested as mild hand, foot and mouth disease, but have been reported to cause severe neurological complications with high mortality rates. Treatment options remain limited due to the lack of antivirals. Octaguanidinium-conjugated morpholino oligomers (vivo-MOs) are single-stranded DNA-like antisense agents that can readily penetrate cells and reduce gene expression by steric blocking of complementary RNA sequences. In this study, inhibitory effects of three vivo-MOs that are complementary to the EV-71 internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) were tested in RD cells. Vivo-MO-1 and vivo-MO-2 targeting the EV-71 IRES showed significant viral plaque reductions of 2.5 and 3.5 log 10 PFU/ml, respectively. Both vivo-MOs reduced viral RNA copies and viral capsid expression in RD cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, vivo-MO-3 targeting the EV-71 RdRP exhibited less antiviral activity. Both vivo-MO-1 and 2 remained active when administered either 4 h before or within 6 h after EV-71 infection. Vivo-MO-2 exhibited antiviral activities against poliovirus (PV) and coxsackievirus A16 but vivo-MO-1 showed no antiviral activities against PV. Both the IRES-targeting vivo-MO-1 and vivo-MO-2 inhibit EV-71 RNA translation. Resistant mutants arose after serial passages in the presence of vivo-MO-1, but none were isolated against vivo-MO-2. A single T to C substitution at nucleotide position 533 was sufficient to confer resistance to vivo-MO-1. Our findings suggest that IRES-targeting vivo-MOs are good antiviral candidates for treating early EV-71 infection, and vivo-MO-2 is a more favorable candidate with broader antiviral spectrum against enteroviruses and are refractory to antiviral resistance.",

As shown in Fig. 6B , the EV-71 MO-1-mutant-1, which carried a single point mutation at position 533 (T to C substitution), required higher vivo-MO-1 concentrations to achieve a similar inhibitory effect when compared to the wild type. The EV-71 MO-1-mutant-2 with a single point mutation in the middle of the targeted sequence (a T to C substitution at position 523) remained sensitive to vivo-MO-1, but vivo-MO-1 had reduced inhibitory efficacy when compared with the wild type. Increasing the number of mutations on the targeted sequence significantly reduced the inhibitory efficacy of vivo-MO-1. The viral plaque inhibition at 2 lM of vivo-MO-1 against EV-71 MO-1-WT was 98.9% \u00b1 0.1, and reduced to 89.6% \u00b1 3.4 for the MO-1mutant-1 that carried a point mutation at the 3' end of the target sequence. The viral plaque inhibition by vivo-MO-1 reduced to 78.0% when the number of nucleotide mismatches increased to three.",

            "text": "Amongst the three vivo-MOs being examined, the two vivo-MOs targeting the EV-71 IRES stem-loop region exhibited significant antiviral activity. The vivo-MOs blocked EV-71 viral RNA translation in a cell-free inhibition assay, as well as in a cell-based EGFP reporter inhibition assay. Previous studies have also reported that only PMOs targeting the positive strand IRES regions or the AUG start codon sites were effective when compared to PMOs targeting other regions of the viral RNA (Stone et al., 2008; Vagnozzi et al., 2007; Yuan et al., 2006) . The PMO may bind with the complementary viral RNA and disrupt the integrity of the IRES stem-loop secondary or tertiary structures, hence arresting IRES-dependent translation (Kole et al., 2012; Warren et al., 2012) . The PMOs are likely to block 40S ribosomal subunit binding the viral RNA in the vicinity of the stem-loop V in the picornaviral type I IRES (Belsham, 2009) . Furthermore, it has been suggested that the IRES stem-loop V-VI of EV-71 interacts with IRES-specific trans-acting factors such as FUSE-binding protein and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Al (Lin et al., 2009a,b; Shih et al., 2011) . Unlike synthetic double-stranded siRNA which involve cleavage of mRNA, PMOs are translation-suppressing oligonucleotides which do not lead to RNA degradation (Kole et al., 2012; Warren et al., 2012) . This could explain why siRNA targeting the similar viral sequences as vivo-MO-3 was effective, but not acting as a translation suppression oligonucleotide which down-regulates gene expression via steric blockage. IRES-targeting vivo-MO-2 exhibited broad-spectrum activities against multiple enteroviruses, but with different antiviral efficacies. This could have resulted from the IRES stemloop structure differences between enteroviruses which affect the accessibility of the vivo-MOs to the targeted sites (Dias and Stein, 2002) .",

We failed to isolate any EV-71 resistant to vivo-MO-2 even after eight passages in vitro, implying that the vivo-MO-2 targeted region is intolerant to mutation in nature. Our mutagenesis studies further confirm that the position of mutation and the number of mutations affect the antiviral efficacies in RD cells. A single mismatch present in the middle of the targeted sequence (T to C substitution at position 523) was more tolerable than a mutation appearing at the end of the targeted site (T to C substitution at position 533). These findings correlated well with previous findings that PV, FMDV and WNV that showed resistance to PPMO also carry a single point mutation at the end of the PPMO-targeted sequence (Stone et al., 2008; Vagnozzi et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008) .
