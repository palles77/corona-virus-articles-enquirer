The purpose of this study is to investigate the radioprotective effects of radiation caused damages in hematopoietic system and normal tissues in mice. A total of 57 BALB/c mice were randomized into six treatment groups: control, IR treatment (0.195, 0.585 and 1.170 g/kg, p.o. daily), L-glutamine (0.520 g/kg) and sham group. All mice except the sham group were irradiated and then administered for one week. The radioprotective effect on hematopoietic system, serum cytokines, and intestinal toxicity was studied. Protective effects on spleen and thymus are found in IR-treated groups. IR assisted in restoration of leukocytopenia after whole mice irradiation with significant reduction of serum TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6. These enhancements of hematopoietic effects are due to an increase in the serum G-CSF concentration in IR treated groups. In histopathological assessment, significant improvement of intestine toxicity is observed in high-dose IR and L-glutamine group. Evidences show that IR has potentials to be a radioprotector, especially in recovery of hematopoietic system, reduction of inflammatory cytokines and intestinal toxicity. Indirubin may play a crucial role, but the underlying mechanism is not very clear and warrants further studies.",

However, its acute and late toxicity on normal tissue often result in severe mobility during treatment course. This disability also limits the role of radiotherapy in cancer treatment. Radiation toxicity occurs either by direct or indirect damage to the DNA (Schulte-Frohlinde 1986). Indirect radiation reaction, which occurs mainly through oxidative free-radicals mechanism, contributes to a large extent to radiobiological effect (Zaider et al. 1994) . Damages caused to DNA by ionizing radiation can result in the loss of viability of the cells exposed to radiation. The factors that influence the response of living cells to radiation are tissue type, DNA repair status of damaged cells, local circulation, and physiological status (Pasupathy et al. 2001) . In Chinese medicine, radiation could cause so called ''toxic heat'', which can increase inflammatory fever, cause blood damage, loss of intercellular liquid and energy.",

Meanwhile, significant reduction of serum IL-1b is observed in the IR-M and IR-H groups (po0.05, Fig. 5 ). Dose-dependent reduction of serum IL-6 is found in the IR groups and the reduction is significant in the IR-H group (po0.05, Fig. 6 ).",

In normal tissues, radiation injury results from a sequence of simultaneous events that include activation of the immune system, inflammation process, regeneration of epithelium and endothelium, tissue fibrosis, and remodeling (Fajardo 1989 ).

            "text": "The radioprotective effect of IR extract powder is studied in this whole body irradiated murine model. Acute exposure to elevated doses of ionizing radiation causes defects in hematopoiesis, resulting in leukocytopenia. In the present study, evidence of significant conservation in the weight of spleen and thymus, and hematopoietic system status shows the radioprotective effect of IR extract powder. The radioprotective ability of IR in the recovery of hematopoietic system is further confirmed by the increase in the spleen and thymus weights in IR-treated groups. In this study, mice exposed to whole body irradiation of 5.4 Gy in three consecutive days and then treated with IR are very effective in stimulating recovery of hematopoietic cells. The mechanisms by which IR stimulate the regeneration of hematopoietic cells might be due to the increase in G-CSF expression. Suzuki et al. reports that the possible mechanism may be attributed to the presence of the therapeutic content, namely, indirubin in IR (Suzuki et al. 2005) . Our results shows that the indirubin concentration in IR powder is 4.270.1 mg/ml, which is higher (0.224-2.384 mg/g) than Liau et al. detected in botanical indigowood root (Liau et al. 2007 ). During the outbreak of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in 2003, IR was widely applied in the treatment of SARS in China and was reported to have anti-SARS effect (Lin et al. 2005) . The major cause of mortality in SARS patients are interstitial pneumonia, characterized with a condition of diffuse, chronic inflammation of the lungs beyond the terminal bronchioles (Fowler et al., 2003) . Radiation pneumonia occur with similar clinical pictures-acute inflammatory stage and a late fibrotic change (Tsoutsou and Koukourakis 2006) . Many chemical compounds in IR are reported in previous studies, including indigotin, indirubin, isatin, isaindigotidione, organic acids, and amino acids (Wu et al. 1997 have been found as potent aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists (Peter Guengerich et al. 2004) . Indirubin and alkaloid isaindigotone are part of water-insoluble components in IR. The methanol extract of IR is proven to have antinociceptive, antiinflammatory, and antipyretic effects in animal study (Ho and Chang 2002) . Alkaloid isaindigotone and its derivatives are found to have inhibitive function on leukocytes and act as a scavenger of superoxide either through the hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase system or through stimulated human neutrophils (Molina et al. 2001) . Indirubin is reported to be one of the most effective compounds in IR, which have anti-inflammatory and cyclindependent kinases (CDK) inhibitory reaction (Hoessel et al. 1999) . Indirubin is also found to have inhibitory action on the expression of the chemokine regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) mRNA expression in influenza-infected bronchial epithelial cells (Mak et al. 2004 ). Cytokines including TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 play a significant role in the development of radiation related toxicity (M\u00fc ller and Meineke 2007). Radiation is found to induce TNF-a which may exacerbate the cytotoxic effects of radiation. Interestingly, TNF-a is also found to enhance X-ray killing of human tumor cells in vitro and enhances tumor control when combined with radiotherapy in animal tumor models (Azria et al. 2004 ). Sakai et al used IL-6 knockout mice to study the cytokines related to radiation pneumonia (Sakai et al. 2008) . They found that stable expression of inflammation (CD44) and apoptosis (Bak) markers are observed in IL-6 knockout mice after thoracic irradiation when compared with control group. Moreover, IL-6 is reported to be a biomarker to predict radiation lung toxicity (Kong et al. 2008) . In our study, significantly lower serum TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 levels are observed in the IR-treated groups when compared with the control group. These results strengthen the important role of IL-6 in radiation-induced inflammation and imply the potential use of IR in radioprotection.",

In our animal model, evidence shows that IR can reduce tissue injury caused by radiation, demonstrates radioprotective effect in hematopoietic system recovery, modulation of serum inflammatory cytokines, and improvement of severe enteropathy in irradiated mice. Indirubin may play a therapeutic role, but the underlying mechanism is not very clear and warrants further studies.",
