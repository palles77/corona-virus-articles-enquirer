Mean global severity was 144 for meditation, 248 for exercise, and 358 for control. Compared with control, global severity was signifi cantly lower for meditation (P = .004). Both global severity and total days of illness (duration) trended toward being lower for the exercise group (P = .16 and P = .032, respectively), as did illness duration for the meditation group (P = .034). Adjusting for covariates using zero-infl ated multivariate regression models gave similar results. There were 67 ARI-related days of-work missed in the control group, 32 in the exercise group (P = .041), and 16 in the meditation group (P <.001). Health care visits did not differ signifi cantly. Viruses were identifi ed in 54% of samples from meditation, 42% from exercise, and 54% from control groups. Neutrophil count and interleukin-8 levels were similar among intervention groups.

In a series of observational and viral inoculation studies, perceived stress, 10 negative emotion, 11 and lack of social support 12 predicted not only self-reported illness, but also such biomarkers as viral shedding and infl ammatory cytokine activity. Evidence suggests that mindfulness meditation can reduce experienced stress and negative emotions. 13, 14 Similarly, both epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested that regular exercise may protect people from ARI illness. 15, 16 A recent observational cohort study (n = 1,002 adults) reported 32% to 46% lower incidence, duration, and severity of ARI illness among the most active vs least active participants. 17 Thus, suffi cient evidence exists to justify testing the hypothesis that training in meditation or exercise can reduce susceptibility to ARI illness.",

All UW instructors have advanced degrees, and all were trained in Massachusetts by the Kabat-Zinn's group. The standardized 8-week MBSR course includes weekly 2\u00bd-hour group sessions and 45 minutes of daily at-home practice. This intervention, originally designed for stress reduction, is based on the idea that an increased awareness of physical, emotional, and cognitive manifestations of stress may lead to a healthier mind-body response to stress. The concept of mindfulness refers to a state of nonjudgmental awareness, a heightened sensitivity to bodily sensation, and attention to one's own thoughts and emotions. The goal for learners is to continue lifelong meditation practice.",

During each ARI illness episode, severity was assessed once daily using a 24-item version of the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS). [24] [25] [26] The WURSS-24 adds items assessing headache, body aches, and fever to the well-validated WURSS-21. 27 Daily severity scores come from summing items 2 through 23; the fi rst and last items are analyzed separately. The beginning of each ARI illness episode was defi ned as the time a participant fi rst answered yes to either: \"Do you think you are coming down with a cold?\" or \"Do you think that you have a cold?\" The participant also had to score 2 or more points on the Jackson scale, 28 with at least 1 point from the following cold symptoms (or synonyms): (1) nasal discharge (runny nose), (2) nasal obstruction (plugged nose, stopped up nose, stuffi ness), (3) sneezing, or (4) sore throat (scratchy throat). To be classifi ed as an ARI illness episode, these criteria had to be met at least 2 days in a row. The last day of the ARI illness episode was the last day the participant rated illness severity higher than 0 using the fi rst item of the WURSS instrument, \"How sick do you feel today?\" Times of self-report were recorded, and illness duration was assessed in hours and minutes and then converted to decimalized days. Participants were provided Jackson and WURSS questionnaires at enrollment and were reminded with each study contact to begin documenting ARI symptoms as soon as they believed they might be getting a cold.",

To control for multiple testing, we chose a P \u2264.025 cutoff for null hypothesis rejection. One-sided testing was justifi ed by previously published research, all in the direction of positive results. To arrive at the primary outcome of area-under-the-curve global severity, we fi rst computed daily WURSS-24 scores by simple summation and then applied trapezoidal approximation over illness episodes. For the less than 2% of missing WURSS-24 data, we assessed patterns of missing data, which satisfi ed missing-at-random criteria, then applied a multiple imputation strategy, using an expectancy maximization algorithm, 40 which was undertaken before unblinding. Unadjusted between-group contrasts were calculated using 1-sided t tests for continuous variables and proportional difference testing for binomials. Because most participants did not experience ARI illness, zeroinfl ated regression models were used to control for potential confounders. These models take into account both logistic (incidence) and linear (days of illness or global severity) data. Covariates used in these models were age, sex, education, smoking status, body mass index, baseline physical and mental health (SF-12), and cohort. Because global severity was skewed, Box-Cox transformation was used for this outcome in these models. To explore potential causal pathways, we assessed the relationship of secondary outcomes measured just after interventions to the main outcomes. The statistical framework for potential mediation was based on the Baron and Kenny model, 41 modifi ed by Krull and MacKinnon, 42 and by coauthor Brown. 43 Additional detail on the results of the zeroinfl ated regression models and potential confounders is available in Supplemental Table 1 and Table 2.

Looking at ARIrelated absenteeism, there were 48% fewer days missed in the exercise group, and 76% fewer in the meditation group.

In terms of strengths, this randomized trial is the fi rst to assess effects of mindfulness meditation on ARI illness and the fi rst to use a validated outcome measure to assess effects of exercise on ARI illness. It is also the fi rst to compare 2 behavioral interventions with a valid control condition, allowing head-to-head comparative effectiveness assessment. The use of multiplex PCR to identify viruses and of IL-8 and neutrophil assays to assess infl ammation is also a strength. Limitations include the inescapable fact that participants in such a trial cannot be blinded to behavioral training interventions, thus allowing for the possibility of self-report bias. Also, even with the large effect sizes observed, our sample size was only marginal for statistical signifi cance for several outcomes. Although it is not likely that our fi ndings are entirely due to chance, the a priori selection of P \u2264.025 as a cutoff for null hypothesis rejection does leave that statistical possibility open for some outcomes. Finally, interpretation of results is limited in that the fi rst cohort was followed for a full cold and infl uenza season, Mean missed days, n (95% CI) 1.9 (0.8 to 3.1) c Two nasal wash samples from the meditation group yielded both CoV and HRV. One ARI in the control group yielded both AdV and HRV.",

If participants in the control group were overreporting ARI illness, we would expect them to also report a similar magnitude of improved scores on other selfreport health measures, which they did not do. Similar thinking applies to the biomarkers. If participants in the intervention groups were under-reporting ARI illness, one might expect that the episodes they did report would be relatively more severe, with higher levels of infl ammatory markers and higher viral identifi cation rates. These trends were not seen, except for marginally higher IL-8 levels in the meditation group. Notes: Data shown represent mean at 9 weeks (1 week after 8-week intervention), then approximately 3 months later. Two-sided P values calculated by simple 2-sample contrast using t test, SAS software. Statistical signifi cance for secondary outcomes should be interpreted as exploratory and hypothesis-generating rather than confi rmatory and hypothesis-testing. a P <.01 for comparison of intervention means vs control means at each period. b P <.05 for comparison of intervention means vs control means at each period. We were surprised to fi nd that, apart from marginally reduced stress and increased optimism, the interventions did not appear to have much infl uence on self-reported psychosocial health measures. One partial explanation may be that this was a relatively healthy population. National norms for similarly aged adults using the SF-12 are 46.3 for physical health and 50.1 for mental health. 44 At baseline, participants in our study had SF-12 scores of 50.5 and 51.4, respectively. Our participants also reported less stress than is usual, with mean PSS-10 scores of 11.9, well below national averages of 13.4 reported in 2006 and 14.5 in 2009. 45 Interpreting these fi ndings, one might hypothesize that sicker and more stressed people would have more to gain, and that similar interventions might yield greater benefi ts in those populations. That hypothesis deserves further testing.",
