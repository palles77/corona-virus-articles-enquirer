No data is available on HFNC use in the general pediatric ward. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of HFNC oxygen therapy in infants hospitalized in a pediatric ward for moderate-severe bronchiolitis and to assess the changes in ventilatory parameters before and after starting HFNC support. This prospective observational pilot study was carried out during the bronchiolitis season 2011-2012 in a pediatric tertiary care academic center in Italy. Interruptions of HFNC therapy and possible side effects or escalation to other forms of respiratory support were recorded. Oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2 ), and respiratory rate (RR), measured for a baseline period of 1 h before and at specific time intervals in 48 h after the start of HFNC were recorded. Twenty-seven infants were included (median age 1.3 months; absolute range 0.3-8.5). No adverse events, no premature HFNC therapy termination, and no escalation to other forms of respiratory support were recorded. Median SpO 2 significantly increased by 1-2 points after changing from standard oxygen to HFNC (p <0.001). Median ETCO 2 and RR rapidly decreased by 6-8 mmHg and 13-20 breaths per minute, respectively, in the first 3 h of HFNC therapy (p <0.001) and remained steady thereafter. Conclusions: Use of HFNC for oxygen administration is feasible for infants with moderate-severe bronchiolitis in a general pediatric ward. In these children, HFNC therapy improves oxygen saturation levels and seems to be associated with a decrease in both ETCO 2 and RR.",

HFNC are thought to improve the ventilatory status by prevention of mucous dryness and improvement of mucous-ciliary clearance, reduction of energy expenditure for gas warming and humidification, and provision of continuous positive airway pressure, which contributes to the maintenance of patent alveoli, improves the ventilation-perfusion mismatch, and prevents microatelectasis [6, 9, 12] .",

This choice was made in order to deliver a flow greater than the patient minute ventilation, so that effective fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) equals the nasal cannula oxygen concentration by preventing mixing with room air, and to minimize possible adverse events related to delivery of inadvertently too high positive end expiratory pressure for the patient. The system has an integrated pressure relief valve (manifold) at its input port to limit the maximum system pressure. This valve is set at 45-cm H 2 O.",

The present study is the first to evaluate the effect of HFNC therapy on gas exchange by means of ETCO 2 measurement in patients with bronchiolitis. Despite arterial blood gas analysis being the gold standard of monitoring partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, this is an invasive procedure and it is rarely useful at admission (or later if there is clinical improvement) for patients with bronchiolitis. It can increase stress and work of breathing of these acutely ill infants, which may in turn, worsen their respiratory status.

The lack of a comparison group does not allow for control of confounding factors and it may be argued that other interventions (nasal suction, use of hypertonic saline, salbutamol/adrenaline) during ED stay might have influenced our findings. However, if this had been the case, improvement of ETCO 2 and RR would have been expected between t-1 and t0, when children received the above mentioned interventions, as opposed to the steady ETCO 2 and RR values found at these times in our study.

In contrast to nasal-CPAP which is often poorly tolerated and is impractical outside the intensive care setting [7, 8] , HFNC provides a well-tolerated, easy to use and safe respiratory support, that should be considered for infants with moderate-severe bronchiolitis needing oxygen supplementation, hospitalized in a pediatric ward. Despite the fact that our small sample size does not allow to properly assess the safety of this intervention on the ward, possible harm related to HFNC is rare according to the published literature. So far, only one report of a significant pneumothorax requiring intubation has been reported in a 2-month-old child who was receiving HFNC at a flow of 8 l/min for bronchiolitis [13] .",
