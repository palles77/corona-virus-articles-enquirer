To control emerging infections, however, vaccines will need to be delivered to older individuals who, unlike infants, probably have had prior infection or vaccination with related viruses and thus have cross-reactive antibodies against the vaccines. Whether and how these cross-reactive antibodies impact live attenuated vaccination efficacy is unclear. Using an open-label randomized trial design, we show that subjects with a specific range of cross-reactive antibody titres from a prior inactivated Japanese encephalitis vaccination enhanced yellow fever (YF) immunogenicity upon YF vaccination. Enhancing titres of crossreactive antibodies prolonged YF vaccine viraemia, provoked greater pro-inflammatory responses, and induced adhesion molecules intrinsic to the activating Fc-receptor signalling pathway, namely immune semaphorins, facilitating immune cell interactions and trafficking. Our findings clinically demonstrate antibody-enhanced infection and suggest that vaccine efficacy could be improved by exploiting cross-reactive antibodies.",

The first 16 years of this century, alone, have already witnessed the pandemic spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, swine origin H1N1 influenza, ebola and zika viruses, all of which caused global health emergencies [1] [2] [3] . Of the strategies that can be employed to prevent viral spread, vaccination-especially with live vaccines-has undoubtedly the most remarkable track record 4, 5 . Vaccination has eradicated smallpox and has now eliminated polio from most parts of the world. Most recently, a cluster-randomized trial demonstrated that ring vaccination of contacts of ebola cases virtually eliminated any secondary spread of the virus 6 . Measures that are able to effectively prevent the spread of such viruses in susceptible populations should thus be a top research priority.",

This has been a reasonable approach as vaccines are most likely to be given to infants and young children to prevent childhood diseases. With emerging viruses, however, vaccines will have to be delivered to both children and adults, many of whom will probably have had prior infection or vaccination with cross-reactive viruses that are antigenically related to the vaccine strain. Indeed, the endemicity of human coronaviruses globally implies that any SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus vaccination must be effective despite the presence of anti-coronavirus antibodies. Similarly, the control of yellow fever by vaccination, or even zika virus when a vaccine becomes available, will probably be conducted in populations with a high prevalence of dengue antibodies, because these viruses are transmitted by the same mosquito vector. However, whether and how cross-reactive antibodies modify live vaccination outcome remains unclear. Some reports suggest that cross-reactive antibodies reduce vaccine efficacy 7, 8 . In contrast, recent Phase 3 trials of a chimaeric dengue vaccine showed that subjects with prior flavivirus infection experienced significantly better efficacy than individuals immunologically naive to flaviviruses [9] [10] [11] .",

This hypothesis posits that cross-reactive or sub-neutralizing levels of antibodies that develop from prior infection with a heterologous but antigenically related virus enhance viral entry into target cells via Fc gamma receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs). It is thus possible that cross-reactive antibodies augment immunogenicity by enhancing LAV infection of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and triggering host responses intrinsic to activating Fc\u03b3R signalling 12 . Indeed, demonstrating increased immunogenicity, infection and activation of pathways intrinsic to Fc\u03b3R activation would also authenticate the ADE hypothesis clinically, which until now has only been demonstrated in experimental systems. label and randomized clinical trial, the effects of sequential vaccination with two flaviviral vaccines: the inactivated Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine and live attenuated yellow fever (YF) vaccine. These licensed flaviviral vaccines were selected because of their safety profiles and are known to generate cross-reactive antibodies that bind flaviviruses, including dengue, West Nile and zika viruses. A total of 84 healthy volunteers that tested negative for anti-dengue immunoglobulins (IgGs) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were randomized, upon receipt of written informed consent, to receive JE followed by YF vaccine or YF vaccine alone ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1 ). To achieve a gradient of cross-reactive antibodies before YF vaccination, we further subdivided the subjects into three groups based on the time interval between JE and YF vaccination: one (Group 1), four (Group 2) and nine months (Group 3) between vaccinations. Group 4 subjects served as controls (only YF vaccine was administered; Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2 ). Adverse events (AEs) following JE and YF vaccination did not differ among the different groups (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 ). Other than two subjects from Group 3 with suspected dengue and thus excluded from analysis, the levels of JE antibodies were significantly reduced with increasing amount of time post-completion of the two-dose vaccination schedule, generating a gradient of JE antibodies at the point of YF vaccination (Fig. 1c) . Notably, Group 1 subjects had the most differences in JE antibodies when compared with the other groups and provided a broad range of JE antibody titres, covering those observed in Groups 2 and 3. This allowed us to study the effects of cross-reactive JE antibodies on subsequent YF vaccination. Our primary endpoint was the YF neutralizing antibody titres at one month post YF vaccination. Exploratory endpoints included YF vaccine viraemia and the systems biology profile of the host response to vaccination.",

No significant differences in one month YF neutralizing antibody titres were observed between the different groups ( Supplementary  Fig. 1a ). When the YF neutralizing antibody titres one month post YF vaccination were analysed against the JE antibody titre on the day of YF vaccination, an inverted U trend ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1b-d) that fitted a second polynomial function (P = 0.0405) was observed. This trend is similar to in vitro studies that demonstrate ADE of dengue virus infection of monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) 13, 14 . YF neutralizing antibody titres were independent of age, body mass index, gender and ethnicity ( Supplementary Fig. 1e-h) . There was also no correlation between YF and JE antibodies at one month post YF vaccination, suggesting that the higher YF neutralizing antibody response is not due to a boosting of the JE memory response ( Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 1i) . Instead, YF neutralizing antibody titres correlated directly with the magnitude at which pre-YF vaccination sera enhanced YF17D infection in THP-1 monocytic cells, in vitro (Fig. 2c) , which is in contrast with the control group where no correlation was observed (Fig. 2d) . Collectively, our finding suggests that cross-reactive JE antibodies bind YF vaccine to enhance its infection of APCs. We next measured how JE vaccination affects YF vaccine viraemia at days 1, 3 and 7 post-YF vaccination.

To gain insights into how the host response to YF vaccination is altered by cross-reactive antibodies, we adopted a systems biology and non-targeted approach to examine the metabolome, gene expression and cytokine/chemokine concentration in the peripheral blood. First, the global metabolomics investigation, which details the chemical fingerprints left behind by cellular processes, identified >1,100 significantly different features. The enriched metabolic pathways included aminoacyl-RNA-tRNA biosynthesis and linoleic acid, suggesting that increased translation and arachidonic acid synthesis, respectively, act as major contributory factors in enhanced YF immunogenicity (Supplementary Table 6a ). Indeed, follow-up targeted analysis identified the pro-inflammatory lipids, specifically arachidonic acid, linoleic acid and the metabolite byproduct, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), to be significantly elevated only in the enhancing group (Fig. 3a ,c,e) and positively correlated with YF antibody titres (Fig. 3b ,d,f).

Subsequently, a subset of semaphorins was discovered to play important roles in regulating immune cells, especially APC and T cell interaction as well as cellular trafficking [25] [26] [27] . Consistent with the gene expression findings, serum cytokine measurements identified two cytokines that were significantly correlated with YF neutralizing antibody titres, both of which regulate T cell expansion and activation (Supplementary  Table 6b ). First, platelet-derived growth factor isoform-BB (PDGF-BB), which affects T cell expansion 28 , was significantly reduced in the control and non-enhancing groups at day 7 relative to day 0, but not in the enhancing group ( Supplementary Fig. 4a , b). Second, a reduced level of vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D), which inhibits T cell proliferation and activation 29, 30 , was observed in the enhancing group post-YF vaccination, but not in the control and non-enhancing groups ( Supplementary  Fig. 4c) . VEGF-D levels were also negatively correlated with YF antibody titres (Supplementary Fig. 4d) . The cytokine data thus support the gene expression findings. Collectively, these data suggest that YF vaccination in the presence of enhancing levels of cross-reactive antibodies induces expression of genes and cytokines that augment T cell responses.",

The fact that semaphorin genes were upregulated upon YF vaccination only in those individuals with prior JE vaccination is intriguing, and may indicate a signalling pathway intrinsic to activating Fc\u03b3R triggered by ADE. To test this possibility, because SEMA4A is known to be expressed in monocytes, we measured SEMA4A expression in THP-1 monocytes following inoculation with YF17D virus opsonized with an enhancing concentration of mouse-human chimaeric antibody 4G2 (h4G2). This antibody binds the conserved fusion loop of flaviviruses, including YF17D virus ( Supplementary Fig. 5a ). Immune complexes formed between YF17D and h4G2 ( Supplementary Fig. 5b ) resulted in upregulation of SEMA4A mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 5c ) and protein levels ( Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 5d ) at 24 h postinfection, but inoculation of h4G2 or YF17D alone did not change SEMA4A expression. Similarly, YF17D opsonized with pre-YF vaccination serum from the enhancing group subjects ( Supplementary Fig. 5e ) upregulated SEMA4A expression in primary monocytes (Fig. 4f ) , which was significantly reduced when activating Fc\u03b3Rs were blocked with monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 4g) . Furthermore, crosslinking of the activating Fc-receptors alone with anti-Fc\u03b3RI or Fc\u03b3RIIA monoclonal antibodies resulted in significant upregulation of SEMA4A in both THP-1 (Fig. 4h ) and primary monocytes (Fig. 4i) . Together, these results indicate that activating Fc\u03b3R signalling directly induces semaphorin expression in monocytic cells.",

The in vitro experiments have shown that Fc\u03b3R signalling induces semaphorin expression, but prior JE immunization may also induce other adaptive immune responses that alter semaphorin expression independent of activating Fc\u03b3Rs. To exclude this possibility, we investigated in vivo the effects of crossreactive antibodies on YF vaccination in the absence of crossreactive cellular immunity. C57BL/6 mice were first immunized with inactivated JE vaccine. After day 21, the IgG fraction was purified from mouse sera and transferred to immunologically naive animals. Thereafter, YF vaccine was administered in these mice and the draining lymph nodes (DLNs) were isolated 24 h post-vaccination to assess for migration and activation of DCs (Fig. 5a) . The gating strategy to identify DCs is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5i . With increasing concentrations of crossreactive JE IgG antibodies, the total DCs (Fig. 5b) and activated DCs (Fig. 5c ) in the DLNs increased in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with in vitro observations, a low concentration of JE cross-reactive antibodies (1 \u00b5g) resulted in an increased percentage of SEMA4A + DCs (Fig. 5d,e) with higher mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for SEMA4A (Fig. 5f ). In contrast, no differences in SEMA4A MFI were observed across the total cells in the DLNs, or in mice given pre-immune sera (Supplemntary Fig. 5j-l) , suggesting that YF immune complexes induce SEMA4A in DCs (Fig. 5g) . Overall, these in vivo results indicate that enhancing levels of cross-reactive antibodies alone increased DC migration and activation, as well as semaphorin upregulation, which contributes to enhanced immunogenicity.",

They also authenticate the ADE of viral infection [32] [33] [34] clinically. Indeed, only a small minority of dengue patients secondarily infected with a cross-reactive serotype of dengue virus develop severe disease 35, 36 . That immunogenicity enhancement was observed within a restricted range of pre-existing JE antibody titres can be explained by the stoichiometry requirement for optimal co-ligation of activating Fc\u03b3R. Low titres of antibody could be suboptimal for activating Fc\u03b3R co-ligation 37, 38 , whereas high titres of cross-reactive antibody could aggregate YF vaccine to instead co-ligate the inhibitory Fc\u03b3RIIB, which reduces the uptake of vaccine by APCs (ref. 39) . With ADE, infection led to prolonged viraemia and Fc\u03b3R-dependent signalling that could have, at least in part, resulted in upregulation of inflammatory metabolites. This interpretation is consistent with previous reports showing that immune complexes can upregulate these metabolites, resulting in increased phagocytosis 40, 41 and improved immune responses 42, 43 . In addition, genes, pathways and cytokines that are known to regulate T cell activation and differentiation were upregulated, although demonstration of an actual improvement in T cell function will need to be shown in a separate study. These observations could potentially explain why individuals with pre-exposure to flavivirus infection demonstrated improved efficacy of the chimaeric YF-dengue virus vaccine compared with immunologically naive individuals [9] [10] [11] .",

            "text": "Multiple factors have been proposed to influence vaccine efficacy. These include host genetics, the human microbiome and other environmental influences [44] [45] [46] . Our study highlights that vaccine efficacy can be positively influenced by past exposure to heterologous viruses, provided that the cross-reactive antibody titre is optimal for LAV enhancement. It suggests that, if possible, ADE could be exploited to deliver LAVs to overcome a key limitation of vaccination. LAVs, as reported previously, trigger extensive innate immune responses soon after vaccination 18, 47 . Although these responses are needed to stimulate adaptive immune responses against the LAV, they may also rapidly clear the vaccine, thereby limiting the window available for the adaptive immune response to be exposed to the antigen. Indeed, our findings that viraemia levels at day 7, but not day 3, post YF vaccination correlated with eventual YF neutralizing antibody titre indicate that the duration of LAV infection influence immunogenicity. Not surprisingly, therefore, even highly potent LAVs such as those for measles and polio require a booster to sustain the long-term immunity that typically arises following natural wild-type viral infection 48, 49 . The improved immunogenicity of the live attenuated YF vaccine in those with enhancing titres of cross-reactive antibodies thus suggests an approach to overcoming short-lived immunity with vaccination. It could also lead to reducing the need for multiple dosing regimes to achieve adequate neutralizing antibody titres sufficient for protective immunity. Determining the vaccine doses that achieve the antibody-antigen stoichiometry optimal for activating Fc\u03b3R co-ligation to enhance LAV infection and immunogenicity could thus be a pragmatic approach to achieving longer-lasting vaccine efficacy.",

Mice (C57Bl/6) were obtained from InVivos (Singapore) and were housed in the Duke-NUS vivarium for the duration of the experiment. Protocols were approved by the SingHealth IACUC. Mice were vaccinated by intraperitoneal injection with 1 \u00b5g of human inactivated JE vaccine (Ixiaro). After 21 days, the mice were killed and the blood was collected by intracardiac puncture. IgG was purified from the pooled mouse serum using the Nab Protein A/G Spin Kit (ThermoScientific). Purified IgG were quantitated by nanodrop, then transferred to naive mice at three different concentrations (1, 10 and 100 \u00b5g) by intraperitoneal injection. The control group was given saline alone. After 24 h, all groups were challenged with Stamaril, 200 UI per mouse, subcutaneously in rear footpads. Lymph nodes (n = 6 independent lymph nodes per group) were isolated after an additional 24 h, and single cell suspensions were prepared using a 70 \u00b5m nylon cell strainer (Falcon) after treatment for 30 min with collagenase (Sigma) in a tissue culture incubator. Cells were blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Gibco). To determine the numbers of activated DCs and levels of SEMA4A, cells were stained with antibodies against CD11c-Pacific Blue (ThermoScientific), CD80-BV605 (BD Biosciences), CD86-BV510 (BD Biosciences) and SEMA4A (Abcam) in a buffer consisting of PBS containing 1% BSA. After washing with PBS, anti-rabbit AlexaFluor488 was used for secondary staining. After washing, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Data were acquired using a Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analysed and prepared for publication using FlowJo and Prism Software. Female mice were 6-8 weeks old at the beginning of the experiments. Sample size calculations were not performed in advance and no randomization or blinding procedures were used.",
