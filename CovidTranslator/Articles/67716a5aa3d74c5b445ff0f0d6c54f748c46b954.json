Recent studies have shown that HIV-1 and Ebola virus, two unrelated viruses, both employ Tsg101, an endosomal protein sorting factor, for efficient budding (Martin-Serrano et al., 2001) . Furthermore, budding of both HIV-1 and Ebola virus occurs through lipid rafts of the host cell plasma membrane (Bavari et al., 2002; Rousso et al., 2000) .

Lentiviral vector pseudotyping has been achieved using viral producer cells transfected with three expression plasmids: a lentiviral packaging construct encoding HIV Gag, an envelope-encoding plasmid, and a reporter vector expressing luciferase (Naldini et al., 1996) . The use of this system in transiently transfected 293T cells allowed production of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors that could be used to study intracellular trafficking of HIV Gag and alternative envelope proteins, specifically HIV Env and Ebola GP. Here, we used this system to study the assortment of two distinct viral glycoproteins, synthesized from a single expression vector within the same cell, into viral particles. This analysis was performed by biochemical analysis and immunoprecipitation of virus preparations to determine the surface expression of each glycoprotein and by confocal imaging within virus producer cells and in HIV-1-infected primary T cells. Gaining a knowledge of this process advances a basic understanding of viral protein trafficking and HIV virion formation at the same time that it lends insight into potential targets of antiviral therapy and vaccine design.",

Expression of the envelope proteins was first confirmed biochemically: each viral glycoprotein was detected by western blotting in the same fractions after buoyant density sedimentation analysis ( Figures 1A and 1B) , with Env, GP, and Gag expression observed within the range of densities expected for functional lentiviral particles . Cell surface expression of both Env and GP, the viral spikes, in the same cell was confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figure 1C ; right upper panel).

Unexpectedly, incubation followed by precipitation with Env-or GP-specific antibodies eliminated transduction of the relevant, but not the heterologous, target cell population compared to control IgG using comparable amounts of infecting vectors ( Figure 3A , left, aEnv versus aGP or IgG and right, aGP versus aEnv or IgG), implying that the viral envelopes segregated to distinct viral particles despite the fact that both were expressed in the same cells using the double expression vector. Immunodepletion studies were also performed on virions produced from singly (Env or GP) transfected 293T cells and mixed in different ratios. Similar patterns of infectivity and reduction after immunodepletion were observed with these mixed samples on the relevant target cells ( Figure S1 available online).

Three-dimensional visualization of transfected MAGI-CCR5 cells revealed colocalization of HA-Env and myc-Env ( Figure 4A , left panels; Pearson's correlation = 0.493), as would be expected from previous studies (Yang et al., 2005b) . While this correlation is highly significant, the association of HA-and myc-Env trimers is not complete because of the statistical nature of trimer formation, where homotrimerization would be anticipated in approximately one-third of spikes. Thus, the degree of colocalization seen by confocal microscopy is within the expected range.

Using channel masking of contour surface objects and iso-surface modeling, colocalization of these respective gene products was defined. There was minimal colocalization of Gag and Env throughout the cell ( Figure 5A ; Pearson's correlation = 0.13); however, when the analysis was limited to the plasma membrane region where virus assembly occurs by setting specific gating criteria ( Figure S4 ), the correlation coefficient between Gag and Env increased to 0.26 ( Figure 5B ), suggesting that the association was greater at the site of budding on the plasma membrane. The cytoplasmic distribution of GP was too low to generate a meaningful correlation with Gag, but a positive correlation between GP and Gag was also evident at the plasma membrane ( Figure 5C ; 0.66). Interestingly, Env and GP showed no evidence of colocalization: the Pearson's correlation was close to zero both in the cytoplasm and on the membrane ( Figure 5D ), indicating these two viral spike proteins segregated to distinct sites in discrete lipid rafts. Therefore, it appeared that each viral glycoprotein associated independently with distinct Gag ribonucleoprotein complexes to give rise to distinct viral particles. Finally, to confirm the distribution of Gag and Env in HIV-infected cells, imaging was performed on MAGI-CCR5 cells and human CD4+ T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and , which showed colocalization and served as a positive control (left panels). MAGI-CCR5 cells were transiently transfected with GP and HA-Env-expression vectors (right panels). Immunofluorescent staining was performed 40 hr later.

It was expected that a producer cell containing two viral spikes could give rise to virions containing both viral spike glycoproteins (Figure 7) . Though the producer cell was able to generate viral particles that incorporated each viral spike, these glycoproteins segregated to distinct lipid raft-like microdomains and ultimately separated pseudotyped lentiviral vectors (Figures 3-5) . This finding suggests that a single Gag particle associates with one lipid raft that is homogeneous with respect to trimeric viral envelope. This observation was made for both Ebola and HIV glycoproteins, and we have observed it between HIV-1 Env and other viral glycoproteins as well, including HIV-1 Env and SARS, HIV-1 Env and FeLV, and HIV-1 and MuLV (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated that Envs derived from closely related lentiviruses, such as HIV-1 variants or HIV-2 and SIV, can form mixed heterotrimers (Boulay et al., 1988; Doms et al., 1990; Yang et al., 2005a; Yang et al., 2005b) . Such heterotrimers would be expected to colocate to the same lipid raft as confirmed here ( Figure 4A , left panels), but viral spikes from different glycoproteins did not colocalize to the same lipid rafts ( Figure 4A, right panel) . These observations suggest that this association is dependent on the coiledcoil region of the viral spike, which may also contribute to the formation of trimeric oligomers within the lipid raft. While each raft is homogeneous with respect to the viral spike, other host membrane glycoproteins are not likely excluded from the raft because many such cellular proteins are incorporated into mature virus particles (Arthur et al., 1992) .",

It was generally known that pseudotyped viral particles could be made with the core of one virus surrounded by heterologous envelope proteins. But, the segregation of different spikes to distinct viral particles has not been previously appreciated, and this finding was unexpected. Confocal microscopy revealed distinct subcellular distribution of Env, GP, and Gag. Though at the plasma membrane, Env and GP colocalized separately with Gag at the presumed site of budding. Furthermore, Gag expression did not alter the subcellular distribution of envelope proteins by confocal imaging analysis ( Figure 4B ; Figure S2 ). A similar distribution of Env or GP was observed intracellularly in cells cotransfected with or without HIV-1 Gag. The association of a single viral spike with each particle suggests that the viral ribonucleoprotein complex associates with each lipid raft. This finding could arise if Gag oligomerization occurred prior to its association with an individual raft. Alternatively, the interaction of Gag with its relevant viral glycoproteins on a lipid raft may recruit additional Gag molecules to complete the formation of a single viral particle.",

The inclusion of the appropriate glycoproteins and exclusion of heterologous envelope proteins would, in fact, be crucial for the survival of a virus species. Here, the analysis of two envelopes expressed in a producer cell also served to define the mechanism of viral assembly further. The quantal nature of the spike association with Gag provides fundamental insight into the nature of HIV-1 assembly and suggests that the virus exploits normal cellular substructures and pathways of protein trafficking to allow its disparate components to interact selectively and to complete assembly. Knowledge of this mechanism also facilitates the development of antagonists of HIV-1 that could inhibit productive viral replication and lends insight into strategies for AIDS vaccine design.",

S or GP was expressed under the control of an mPGK promoter and bovine growth hormone polyadenylation expression cassette, whereas Env was regulated by the RSV promoter and SV40 polyadenylation sequence. Briefly, the mouse PGK promoter (McBurney et al., 1991) was amplified with the sense primer 5 0 -AAT TTG GCC AGG TAC CGA ATT CTA CCG GGT AGG GGA GGC GCT T-3 0 and antisense primer 5 0 CCT TGA TAT CGG TCG AAA GGC CCG GAG ATG 3 0 . The MscI/EcoRV fragment of mPGK was then inserted into MscI/EcoRV-digested pVRC1012-gp145DCFIDV12 , and gp145DCFIDV12 was subsequently replaced by digestion with XbaI and treatment with Klenow, followed by BamHI digestion and insertion with S (isolated from CMV/R-S [Huang et al., 2004] by digestion with SalI followed by Klenow incubation, then BamHI digestion). Alternatively, gp145DCFIDV12 was replaced by digestion with BamHI, treatment with Klenow incubation, and then XbaI digestion and insertion with GP (isolated from pGPDMUC [Yang et al., 2000] ) by incubation with KpnI, treatment with Klenow fragment, followed by XbaI digestion). The expression vector encoding Env was prepared by ligating an XbaI/Klenow/BamHI fragment of Env from plasmid pVRC1012-gp160(89.6P) into the HindIII/Klenow/ BglII-treated RSV-rabbit-b-globin plasmid (Gorman et al., 1983) . The resulting plasmid RSV-Env was treated with NdeI/HpaI to excise the RSV/Env / SV40-polyA expression unit. This expression unit was then cloned into EcoRI/Klenow/NdeI-digested mPGK/S or mPGK/GP to make the double expression vectors. Protein expression was confirmed by western blot analysis.",

The fraction of one channel volume colocalized with another channel volume, and the Pearson channel correlation in colocalized volume was calculated for cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and whole cell using Imaris software colocalization package. Automatic thresholding performed on channels selected for colocalization analysis in Imaris is based on an algorithm developed by Costes and Lockett at NIH (Costes et al., 2002) .
