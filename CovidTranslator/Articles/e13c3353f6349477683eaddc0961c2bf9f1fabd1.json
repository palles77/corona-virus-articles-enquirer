            "text": "Coronaviral infection of New World camelids was first identified in 1998 in llamas and alpacas with severe diarrhea. In order to understand this infection, one of the coronavirus isolates was sequenced and analyzed. It has a genome of 31,076 nt including the poly A tail at the 3\u2032 end. This virus designated as ACoV-00-1381 (ACoV) encodes all 10 open reading frames (ORFs) characteristic of Group 2 bovine coronavirus (BCoV). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the ACoV genome is clustered closely (> 99.5% identity) with two BCoV strains, ENT and LUN, and was also closely related to other BCoV strains (Mebus, Quebec, DB2), a human corona virus (strain 043) (>96%), and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus ( > 93% identity). A total of 145 point mutations and one nucleotide deletion were found relative to the BCoV ENT. Most of the ORFs were highly conserved; however, the predicted spike protein (S) has 9 and 12 amino acid differences from BCoV LUN and ENT, respectively, and shows a higher relative number of changes than the other proteins. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that ACoV shares the same ancestor as BCoV ENT and LUN.",

They are important causes of human and animal diseases that include respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, hepatic and neurological disorders, as well as immunemediated diseases such as SARS and feline infectious peritonitis (reviewed in de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005; Kahn, 2006; Spaan et al., 1988; Wege et al., 1982) . The coronaviruses possess a characteristic genome composition. The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome encodes two polyproteins (1a and 1ab) that contain proteins necessary for RNA replication. The 3\u2032 one-third encodes two non-structural proteins (NS1 and 2) and several structural proteins, including a nucleocapsid protein (N) and three or four envelope proteins: the membrane (M), spike (S), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), and/or a small membrane (E) proteins.",

            "text": "Originally, coronaviruses were classified into three groups on the basis of their antigenic cross reactivity Cavanagh and Davis, 1993; Tsunemitsu et al., 1995) . When coronavirus genome sequence data became available, the original antigenic groups were converted into three genetic groups based on the similarity of their nucleotide sequences (Gonzalez et al., 2003; Lai, 2003; Vijgen et al., 2006) . Group 2 coronaviruses include murine hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine coronaviruses (BCoV), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), rat sialodacryoadenitis virus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), canine respiratory coronavirus and equine coronavirus. Fifteen strains of BCoV have been sequenced and have been implicated in a variety of diseases including respiratory and enteric infections (Chouljenko et al., 2001a; Dea et al., 1995; Han et al., 2006; King and Brian, 1982; Park et al., 2006; Woloszyn et al., 1990) . For example, the ENT and LUN strains were isolated from animals with fatal shipping fever pneumonia (Chouljenko et al., 2001a) . The former was Virology 365 (2007) 198 -203 www.elsevier.com/locate/yviro associated with enteritis; whereas the latter is associated with respiratory infection (pneumonia). Mebus, Quebec and DB2 are virulent strains associated with neonatal calf diarrhea and winter dysentery in adult dairy cattle (Dea et al., 1995; Han et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006) . Coronavirus associated with outbreaks of diarrhea in all age groups of New World camelids (llamas and alpacas) was first identified in 1998, in Oregon. The symptoms were similar to cattle infected with bovine coronavirus. Sick camelids showed varying degrees of severity of clinical disease, with some animals dying and others requiring intensive medical care. Coronavirus-like viruses were frequently isolated from the diseased animals (Cebra et al., 2003) . Because of the severity of the infection and the ability of coronaviruses to cross the species barriers, including human-animal barriers, we undertook an investigation to further characterize this virus. In this report we describe the sequence of the ACoV and compare it to other members of the coronavirus genus. We found that it is closely related to Group 2 bovine coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Cloning and sequence analysis A total of 21 overlapping cDNA fragments were generated by RT-PCR cDNA cloning to encompass the entire RNA genome. The oligonucleotide primer sets used for these amplifications are listed in Table 1 . The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of the genome were determined by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032RACE, respectively. This resulted in a genome sequence of 31,076 nt including a poly A tail of 38 nt. The genome encodes 10 ORFs characteristic of Group 2 BCoV and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated sequences of 210 and 298 nts (which do not include the poly A tail), respectively (Fig. 1 ). The ORF coordinates are shown in Fig. 1 . The predicted ORF 1a and ORF 1ab contained 13,152 and 21,282 nt, respectively ( Fig. 1) . ORF 1ab contains a 26 nt region that overlapped with ORF 1a and included a predicted 'slippery' sequence UUUAAAC. Based on evidence from other coronaviruses (Chouljenko et al., 2001b) , this sequence causes a \u2212 1 frameshift during the translation of ORF1a. This results in a portion of the proteins (called ORF 1ab) avoiding translation termination and containing an additional 2711 amino acids. Upstream of five of the genes, there is a repeated intergenic sequence, UCUAAAC, that is predicted to interact with the viral transcriptase along with cellular factors to 'splice' the leader sequence onto the start of each ORF. ORF-NS1, HE, S, M and N were all preceded by this sequence (Table  2) , which would be predicted to give rise to a nested set of mRNAs characteristic of the order Nidovirales.",
