Biotinylated and fluorescently labeled double-stranded (ds) DNA amplification products are generated in a 100-nL PCR reactor incorporating an integrated heater and a temperature sensor. After amplification, the products are captured and concentrated in a crosslinked acrylamide gel capture matrix copolymerized with acrydite-functionalized streptavidin-capture agents. Thermal dehybridization releases the fluorescently labeled DNA strand for capillary electrophoresis injection, separation and detection. Using plasmid standards containing the viral genes of interest, each target can be detected starting from as few as 10 copies/reactor. By employing one-step reverse transcription PCR amplification, the device can detect RNA analogues of all four viral targets with detection limits in the range of 25-100 copies/reactor. The utility of the microdevice for analyzing samples from nasopharyngeal swabs is demonstrated. Combining size-based separation with four-color detection, this platform provides excellent product discrimination, making it readily extendable to higher-order multiplex assays. This portable microsystem is also suitable for performing automated assays in point-ofcare diagnostic applications.",

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in which distinct primer pairs are used to amplify more than one target sequence in a single reaction, is one of the most appealing methods in molecular diagnostics because of its high sensitivity, rapid turnaround time and high throughput [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Through careful primer design and the use of hot start polymerase enzymes, high specificity and sensitivity can be achieved [6, 11] . A high degree of multiplexing, ranging from 2-to 22-plex for detection of respiratory pathogens including bacteria and viruses, has been reported [1, 5, 7, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

            "text": "Advancements in miniaturization and microfluidic integration technology provide a pathway for the widespread practice of multiplex PCR diagnostics in clinical settings. By integrating multiple processes onto a single microfabricated device, rapid, low-volume, automated and sensitive assays can be performed [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Because of the superior performance offered by integrated microdevices, a variety of pathogens including the respiratory pathogen Bordetella pertussis [23] , SARS-coronavirus [24] , dengue-2 virus [25] , influenza A virus [26] , and BK virus [27] have already been successfully detected with on-chip approaches. Nevertheless, most of these assays have been limited to single-or duplex analysis [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] performed on preliminary PCR-capillary electrophoresis (CE) microdevices, which do not include sample treatment and processing [20, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Recently, our group developed an integrated PCR-CE device with a pre-amplification immunomagnetic bead-based cell capture for highly specific and sensitive detection of E. coli [28] . In addition, we have reported a novel integrated PCR-CE device with gel-phase oligonucleotide affinity capture for post-amplification cleanup [29] . By copolymerizing oligonucleotide capture probes in a photodefinable cross-linked polyacrylamide matrix directly between the PCR reactor and the CE separation channel, PCR products complementary to those probes are specifically hybridized and preconcentrated. This integrated capture/injection technique exhibits a threeto five-fold increase in signal intensity and a six-fold increase in resolution compared to that using externally polymerized, non-crosslinked capture matrices [29] . The technique, however, is limited in its ability to scale up for multiplex analysis because of the complexity in designing unique and specific capture probes with similar thermodynamic properties for multiple targets.",

The flourophore-labeled strands are released and injected for electrophoresis, leaving the biotinylated strands bound to the capture gel. This technique has previously been used to demonstrate on-chip sample cleanup for forensic short tandem repeat analysis [30, 31] , but is applied here for the first time to multiplex pathogen detection in an integrated format.",

The microfabrication procedure of the microdevice follows the protocols developed previously [33] [34] [35] . Briefly, the fluidic layer is created from a 500-\u00b5m thick Borofloat glass wafer coated with a 2000-\u00c5 layer of amorphous silicon on one side and 200-\u00c5 Ti/ 2000-\u00c5 Pt on the other side. Fluidic structures are etched on the amorphous silicon side to a depth of 40 \u00b5m using 49% hydrofluoric (HF) acid. Heaters are fabricated on the Ti/Pt side of the same wafer by electroplating gold leads followed by ion beam etching of the Ti/Pt to form the serpentine heater elements. All access holes are then drilled using a CNC mill. The RTD layer is formed using a 762-\u00b5m Borofloat glass wafer coated with 200-\u00c5 Ti and 2000-\u00c5 Pt. Features are formed by etching the coated glass wafer in hot aqua regia (3:1 HCl: HNO 3 ) for 5 min. The two wafers are then permanently bonded together in a vacuum furnace at 650 \u00b0C for 6 hr.",

            "text": "The multiplex PCR panel was adapted from a 22-plex MassTag PCR assay [1] . Gene targets, primer sequences, and expected product fragment sizes are listed in Table 1 . Primer sequences were designed based on conserved genomic regions so that each pathogen target could be robustly detected. To ensure stringent multiplex assays, the primers chosen had been verified to have similar melting temperatures with minimal cross-hybridization interactions to avoid primer-dimers. To enable streptavidin/biotin-mediated capture and cleanup, the forward primers were fluorescently labeled at the 5' end with FAM, TAMRA, or JOE, while the 5'-end of the reverse primers were functionalized with biotin (Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), Coralville, IA). Each PCR mix was prepared to a volume of 25 \u00b5L, containing up to 8 \u00b5L of up to four different types of plasmid standards, 0.2 U of HotStarTaq DNA polymerase, 0.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM dNTPs, 2.5 \u00b5L of multiplex PCR buffer containing 6 mM MgCl 2 , pH 8.7 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), 2.5 \u00b5L of Q-solution (Qiagen), and additional 1.25 \u00b5L of multiplex master mix containing HotStar Taq DNA polymerase, multiplex PCR buffer, and dNTP mix (Qiagen), and 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 0.8 \u00b5M (each) concentrations of the forward and reverse primers for FLUBV, hMPV, hCoV-OC43, and FLUAV, respectively. These primer ratios and concentrations were optimized to give similar product yield for all targets at the same starting concentrations. The same assay conditions were applied for standards and swab samples, allowing successful detection of the respective targets. Standard plasmids containing the gene target sequence were prepared from virus or assembled from synthetic polynucleotides. The plasmid standards were diluted in 2.5 ng/\u00b5L human placenta DNA to mimic random nucleic acid background present in clinical samples, and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. cDNA standards generated from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) that contained the respective agents were used to assess performance of the final assay. Briefly, total nucleic acid from 250 \u00b5L NPS suspended in 1 ml standard viral transport media had been extracted using a NucliSENS easyMAG system (Biomerieux, Inc.). Reverse transcription was performed with 10 \u00b5L of total nucleic acid using Superscript II with hexamer priming according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Three \u00b5L cDNA sample were added to the PCR cocktail to a final volume of 20 \u00b5L. Off-chip reactions were performed in parallel to the on-chip experiments using an Eppendorf Mastercycler thermocycler following the same thermocycling protocol. The amplified product was analyzed by conventional capillary electrophoresis using an Applied Biosystems 96 capillary 3730 xl DNA Analyzer. The final sample mixture was prepared using 9:1:1 ratio of PCR Hi-Di\u2122 Formamide (Applied Biosystems): unpurified PCR sample: 500 GeneScan\u2122 ROX size standard (Applied Biosystems). To prevent the formation of secondary structure during the reaction, the RNA template and primer mixture was prepared separately: the 5 \u00b5L primer-template mixture contains 2.5 \u00b5L of the RNA standards and 2.5 \u00b5L of 0.5, 2.0, 1.5, and 2.0 \u00b5M (each) forward and reverse primers for FLUBV, hMPV, hCoV-OC43, and FLUAV, respectively. The primer-template mixture was heat-denatured at 75 \u00b0C for 5 min then immediately chilled on ice to allow the primers to bind to the RNA templates. Finally, the RT-PCR master mix was added to the primer-annealed templates. In vitro transcribed RNA standards were diluted in 2.5 ng/\u00b5L yeast t-RNA (Sigma) to prevent RNA degradation due to frequent freeze-thaw cycles and stored aliquoted and stored aliquoted at \u221280 \u00b0C.

The synthesis protocol of the gel was reported previously [38] . The crosslinked polyacrylamide capture gel was prepared in situ by co-photopolymerizing a 19:1 acrylamide/bis monomer mix with a 5' acrydite-modified streptavidin capture probe. Following the previously developed protocol [30] , a 500 \u00b5L solution was prepared to 5 % (v/v) bis-acrylamide, 6.15 M urea, 1\u00d7 TTE, 2 \u00b5g/\u00b5L streptavidin-acrylamide, 0.0006 % riboflavin (w/v) and 0.125 % TEMED (v/v) in an opaque 2-mL scintillation vial with Teflon closure (National Scientific, Rockwood, TN). This solution was used to form a 500-\u00b5m capture gel plug within the double-T junction in the dynamically coated microchannel as illustrated in Figure 2 . To prevent the monomer solution from contaminating the reactor with PCR and RT-PCR inhibitors such as EDTA and acrylamide monomers, 8% LPA was first loaded from the coinjector into the channel separating the reactor from the capture and separation region ( Figure 2 , step 1). The monomer solution was then introduced into the microchannels. Using an inverted microscope equipped with a mercury arc lamp (Nikon) centered on 365 nm [29] , the double-T junction was irradiated (10 mW/cm 2 ) for 5 min, polymerizing the solution in this region. After photopolymerization, unreacted monomer solution was removed and the microchannels were rinsed with deionized water (Figure 2, step 2 ).",

The reactors are sealed by adding ~500 \u00b5L of a viscous 5% LPA gel over the reactor inlets and outlets. To prevent the reaction cocktail from leaking out of the reactor during thermocycling, excess (~500 \u00b5L) 5% linear polyacrylamide (LPA) gel is added to the coinjectors.

The higher annealing temperature during the initial step-down process promotes assay specificity by ensuring that the primers only hybridize to their complementary target in these critical early cycles [42] . A high level of PCR discrimination is crucial in pathogen detection assays because the pathogen target templates are commonly present in much lower abundance than the ubiquitous host genomic and mRNA backgrounds. For this reason, a step-down PCR scheme was employed.

In contrast, all four products were generated in comparable or greater amounts (n = 3) when reactions were performed in BSA-coated reactors. These results confirm that BSA passivation helps increase reaction yield by likely occupying sites on the glass reactor wall and preventing adherence of the polymerase [43] .

            "text": "Because many viruses have RNA genomes, the capability of the microdevice to analyze RNA samples is crucial. Therefore, RT-PCR amplification using in vitro transcribed RNA standards was investigated, and the sensitivity of the assay in detecting each RNA target was determined. In the presence of all four primer pairs, each RNA standard was reversetranscribed on-chip at 42 \u00b0C for 20 min and amplified in the same reactor using the previously described step-down PCR conditions. Representative electropherograms in Figure 5A show detection and identification of all transcripts at 100 copies/reactor. A negative RT-PCR control containing no templates verifies the absence of nonspecific priming. The sensitivity of the device in detecting each viral RNA transcript was determined by performing RT-PCR on serially diluted RNA standards in the range of 25-10,000 copies/ reactor. Each standard was reverse-transcribed and amplified separately in the presence of all four primer pairs as described previously. Figure 5B shows a comparison of S/N for the amplified products over the range of starting template concentrations (n =3). While FLUBV and hCoV-OC43 can be detected down to 50 and 25 copies respectively, FLUAV and hMPV can be detected at 100 copies (with S/N > 5). As determined by extrapolation to S/N = 3, the calculated limits of detection for FLUBV, hCoV-OC43, FLUAV and hMPV are 4.8, 6.3, 10 and 167 copies, respectively. A lower sensitivity obtained from the RNA samples compared to their DNA counterparts resulting from the known limited efficiency of reverse transcription has been previously observed [1] . In particular, for a multiplex one-step RT-PCR where more than one virus-specific RT primer is present, the optimal choice of RT conditions can become more difficult than in hexamer primed reactions [6] . Nevertheless, the results obtained here demonstrate the ability of the microdevice to process RNA samples, which opens the door to other RNA-based applications such as detection and genotyping of other viruses, HIV viral load testing, and gene expression studies.",

Whereas the performance for FLUAV, FLUBV, hCoV-OC43 was excellent and the negative control yielded no amplification signal, detection of hMPV was not achieved with NPS samples (data not shown). The hMPV primer pair, as already indicated by results with in vitro transcribed RNA, appears to perform less efficiently than the other three primer pairs in this platform, and would need to be specifically redesigned for the microsystem application. Although nonspecific PCR noise in amplification #2 was minimal, the more pronounced background seen in amplification #3 may lead to false-positive or false-negative calls, especially when more primer pairs are introduced in the assay.

The PCR amplification, sequence-independent product capture and concentration, and CE analysis on the automated portable genetic analysis instrument were streamlined to within two hours. The microdevice is capable of processing both DNA and RNA samples with high specificity and sensitivity in clinical samples. This novel integrated microdevice has potential as a platform for robust, automated, high-throughput and sensitive point-of-care diagnostics. Schematic of microdevice preparation and operation. (1) To avoid contamination of the reactor, a 5% linear polyacrylamide (LPA) gel (gray) is loaded into the coinjector prior to introducing the bis/acrylamide monomer solution (brown).

(3) The plug is sandwiched by a separation matrix manually loaded from both anode and cathode. (4) The assay is started by filling the reactor with PCR (or RT-PCR) cocktail (blue), immediately followed by thermocycling. (5) After the amplification is completed, the sample is electrophoresed (red arrow) through the capture plug, where biotinylated PCR products are captured. (6) The captured dsDNA is dehybridized at 67 \u00b0C, releasing the fluorescently labeled ss-DNA for size-based separation at 300 V/cm. Assay specificity and sensitivity determination.
