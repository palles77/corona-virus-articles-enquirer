This condition causes acute inflammation, edema, and necrosis of epithelial cells; increased mucus production; and inadequate oxygenation of tissues, which can permanently damage the respiratory structures. In high-income countries, such as the United States, the number of hospitalizations for severe bronchiolitis have been estimated at 120,000 cases per year among infants, [2] and the proportion of hospitalizations have tripled between 1980 and 1996, from 5% to 16%. [3] In Spain, the incidence of bronchiolitis is estimated at 7%, and hospital admissions is estimated at 1.79% annually in children younger than 2 years.

Severe bronchiolitis was defined as rhinorrhea, cough, tachypnea, wheezing, rales, and increased respiratory effort (e.g., grunting, nasal flaring, and intercostal and/or subcostal retraction), with symptoms of severity (e.g., increased respiratory rate, retractions, and oxygen saturation at 90% or lower). [25] All these children with severe bronchiolitis-diagnosed were hospitalized in ward. In addition, clinical information about healthy age-matched children, that received care for healthy children control, from the same period of time was used as the control group. Informed consent was obtained from the children's parents at the time of clinical evaluation. The Research Council and Ethical Committee of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara Dr. Juan I. Menchaca approved the study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 1975, as revised in 1983.",

These biotin markers act as reference system for the automatic alignment of the array grid, and serve as control of the reagents performance.

In this study, exposure to cigarette smoking was the only independent risk factor associated with severe bronchiolitis treated in the Emergency department at our hospital. This result is consistent with those from previous studies that reported children's exposure to maternal cigarette smoking increased the risk of hospitalization in infants and young children with bronchiolitis. This result suggests that exposure to cigarette smoking decreases pulmonary function in children 2 years or younger, which in turn, results in an increased number of visits to the Emergency department. [2, 12, 17, 18, 33, 34] Regional campaigns to increase awareness about the importance of avoiding exposing young children to cigarette smoking should be reinforced to decrease acute inflammation, hospitalizations, and permanent damage to their lower airway systems.",

Although previous reports have not shown that overcrowded living conditions is associated with severe viral bronchiolitis in infants, [17, 35] overcrowding is a well-known risk factor for severe bronchiolitis. [1, 8, 25] In addition, these associated environmental factors, that were found in our study, may reflect that our hospital primarily serves a low-income population that lacks health insurance. One earlier study reported that living in low-income conditions influences the severity of viral bronchiolitis, [30] but the presence of pets, pest infestation in the house, or farm animals did not. [17, 35] However, the contribution of these environmental factors to worse outcome of viral bronchiolitis in infants and young children is well studied; thus, studies in similar populations are required to analyze these associations. Family factors that were associated with severe viral bronchiolitis in this study were maternal history of asthma and allergies, as have been previously reported in Mexico. [17] However, risk factors such as exposure to cigarette smoking during pregnancy were not associated with severe bronchiolitis in the children studied, contrasting with findings reported previously in Spain and North American. [2, 26] This could be a secondary effect of campaigns against smoking during pregnancy that have been undertaken in Mexico, but are not related with the lack of association between severity of bronchiolitis and pregnancy smoking in this study. Comparable results have been published in Italy. [14] However, activities that prevent smoking Table 4 Multivariate analysis of risk factors associated with severe viral bronchiolitis.",

However, socioeconomic status or parent's level of education was not possible to compare between patients and controls because this information was missing in the majority of the cases, being a limiting of our study. In Mexico, the Ministry of Health provides the seasonal flu vaccines to all children older than 1 year, but vaccination against RSV is not available to date. Although this protective association does not explain the decreased incidence of severe bronchiolitis among vaccinated children, it is important to note that these data reflect that the healthy control group had better health care, including vaccinations against preventable infections. Pregnancy history factors, such as adequate prenatal care and taking calcium during pregnancy, were protective factors for severe viral bronchiolitis in this study. Although a previous report did not find these factors protective, [24] studies in low-income populations should be done to more thoroughly investigate these protective associations.",
