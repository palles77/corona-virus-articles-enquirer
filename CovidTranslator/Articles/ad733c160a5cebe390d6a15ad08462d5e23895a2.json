In less severe cases, fever (I04-I07\u00b0F), anorexia, and depression precede presentation by 3-4 days. At some time during the course of the disease, vomiting that is not associated with eating often develops. Diarrhea is a common but not consistent finding. The intestines may be painful and feel thickened during abdominal palpation. In complicated cases, bloody diarrhea, icterus, and severe dehydration may develop. 11. What laboratory abnormalities are associated with feline panleukopenia? Specific laboratory abnormalities are found most often in the complete blood count. Severe panleukopenia is seen often but not in every case. In severe infections, the total white cell count varies between 50 and 3,000 cells/ul; in more moderate cases, between 3000 and 7000 cells/ill. Complete blood counts should be repeated because other diseases also may present with panleukopenia. The leukopenia associated with FPV resolves within a few days of recovery from illness. Thus, it can be differentiated from other causes of chronic leukopenia. If prolonged panleukopenia exists, other diseases, such as feline leukemia or septic salmonellosis, should be considered. The severity of the leukopenia often reflects the severity of clinical illness. A mild decrease in hematocrit and absolute reticulocyte count may be present in cats with viremia but should not result in marked anemia, unless severe GI bleeding occurs. The anemia remains mild because of the short course of the disease and the long life span of red blood cells. In cases of severe infection, thrombocytopenia may develop. Clotting abnormalities consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) also can be detected in severe infection.",

The fluid deficit (body wt [kg] x percent dehydrated x 1000 =ml) is replaced over 24 hours, along with estimates of ongoing losses and maintenance. Balanced isotonic fluid replacement is used with potassium supplementation. Electrolytes should be measured intermittently to aid in determining potassium needs; a minimum of 20 mEqlL should be used. Blood glucose should be monitored and supplemented as indicated. If clinical evidence of decreased oncotic pressure (peripheral or pulmonary edema) is present concurrently with hypoalbuminemia, plasma or colloids should be administered.

If vomiting persists, a continuous infusion of metoclopramide (1-2 mg/kglday) is often helpful. Water can be reintroduced no sooner than 24 hours after cessation of vomiting. Initially, small amounts of water should be offered. If no vomiting occurs for 24 hours, small amounts of a bland food (specifically a commercial GI diet or rice with small amounts of baby food) may be introduced. If feedings are tolerated, the amount should be increased gradually. After the patient is consuming normal amounts, a slow transition over 4-6 days should be made to regular maintenance diet.",

Intestinal histoplasmosis should be considered in any young cat with intractable large or small bowel diarrhea that has lived in or traveled through an endemic region. 3. How is GI histoplasmosis diagnosed? Definitive diagnosis requires identification of H. capsulatum organisms (usually within macrophages) on cytology or biopsies. Although primary intestinal histoplasmosis has been reported, intestinal involvement most often results from systemic infection. Radiographs of the thoracic cavity may reveal a diffuse interstitial pattern, with infiltrates coalescing to produce a miliary or nodular interstitial appearance. Other signs of systemic involvement include peripheral lymph node enlargement, abdominal organomegaly, clinical icterus, and occasionally skin nodules or ulcerated lesions. Therefore, diagnosis is often aided by bone marrow, lung, lymph node, liver, splenic, or skin nodule aspirates. Ocular involvement is also possible, and physical examination should include a thorough evaluation of the fundus. With intestinal involvement, H. capsulatum organisms may be seen on cytology from rectal mucosal scrapings and impression smears made from intestinal (endoscopic or surgical) or mesenteric lymph node biopsy samples. The yeasts are round to oval in shape with a distinct wall and are approximately 2-4 urn in diameter (about one-fourth to one-half the diameter of an erythrocyte)",

What are the common viral causes of gastrointestinal (GI) disease?Vomiting or diarrhea has been associated most frequently with feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), coronaviruses, feline leukemia virus (see Chapter 76), and feline immunodeficiency virus (see Chapter 77).2. What causes feline panleukopenia?Feline panleukopenia is caused by FPV, a small parvovirus. This single-stranded, DNA-type virus is related closely to canine parvovirus. Cats also can be infected by canine parvovirus and occasionally have clinical signs of disease. The name was derived from the clinical observation that many cats develop severe leukopenia, but this finding is not considered pathognomonic. The disease syndrome also has been called feline distemper. Clinical findings of FPV infection in cats are similar to those associated with canine parvovirus infection.3. How is FPV transmitted and maintained in the environment?FPV is shed in all body secretions; large quantities are present in the feces during active stages of infection. Cats continue to shed virus in feces and urine for a maximum of 6 weeks after infection. The virus is ubiquitous in the environment and can survive readily for more than I year. Susceptible animals are infected via fecal-oral transmission. Fomites are believed to play an important role in transmission because the virus can survive for prolonged periods on contaminated surfaces. Examples of fomites include clothing, shoes, hands, food dishes, and cages. Flies and other insects may serve as transport hosts during warmer periods of the year.",
