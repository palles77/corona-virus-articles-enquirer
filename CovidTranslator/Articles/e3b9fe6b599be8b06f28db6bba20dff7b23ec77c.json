Although humoral immune responses by sarcoidosis subjects to mycobacterial proteins have been detected, mycobacterial antigens capable of inducing cellular immune responses in sarcoidosis subjects have not been reported. We used the enzyme-linked immunospot assay to assess for recognition of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis mycolyl transferase, Antigen 85A, by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 25 sarcoidosis subjects, 22 PPD\u2212 (purified protein derivative) healthy volunteers, and 16 PPD+ healthy subjects. Reactivity to Ag85A whole protein was observed in 15 of 25 sarcoidosis subjects compared to 2 of 22 PPD\u2212 subjects (p = 0.0006, Fisher's exact test) and to 14 of 16 PPD+ subjects (p = 0.084, Fisher's exact test). Monoclonal antibody against HLA-DR inhibited recognition. In addition to immune recognition of Ag85A whole protein, peptide-mapping studies identified four immunogenic Ag85A peptides, which induced Th-1 immune responses in individual sarcoidosis subjects, suggesting that multiple epitopes from a mycobacterial protein may have a role in sarcoidosis immunopathogenesis.",

Syndromes with similar pathologic and immunologic features to sarcoidosis such as chronic beryllium disease (2) , hypersensitivity pneumonitis (3) , and tuberculosis (4) illustrate that granulomatous disease may or may not have an infectious etiology. Studies of T cell receptor gene expression in sarcoidosis subjects reveal oligoclonal collections of \u03b1\u03b2 + CD4+ T cells at sites of granulomatous inflammation, consistent with a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted antigen-driven process (5) (6) (7) . While the antigen(s) responsible for eliciting these responses have not been identified, review of sarcoidosis pathology, immunology, and epidemiology suggest that Mycobacterium antigens may be important (4, 8, 9) . Recent studies of humoral immunity also imply that mycobacteria may be important in sarcoidosis immunopathogenesis. Song et al. noted IgG antibodies to recombinant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) katG in sera from 48% of sarcoidosis subjects compared to 0% in sera from PPD\u2212 controls (p = 0.0059) (10) . Dubaniewicz reported that 12 of 37 sarcoidosis subjects demonstrated a humoral response to MTB heat-shock protein 70 compared to none of 18 controls (p = 0.000) and to 6 of 29 tuberculosis subjects (p = 0.07). Nine of 23 Stage II sarcoidosis subjects demonstrated a higher frequency of anti-MTB heat-shock protein 70 antibodies compared to 3 of 14 Stage I sarcoidosis subjects (p = 0.005) (11) .",

These proteins, present in all Mycobacterium species, function to transfer mycolic acids, leading to the formation of cord factor (\u03b1-\u03b1\u2032-trehalose dimycolate) (12) . This complex also has been shown to induce strong CD4+ T cell responses during infection with MTB. In patients infected with MTB or M. leprae, MTB Antigen 85A (Ag85A) has been shown to induce strong T cell proliferative responses as well as generate the production of interferon-\u03b3 (13) . Disruption of the genes encoding the three Ag85 components of MTB suggests that Ag85A may be the most essential component for bacterial survival within macrophages (14) . Due to the pathologic and immunologic similarities of sarcoidosis to tuberculosis, we assessed for immune recognition of Ag85A by sarcoidosis subjects, PPD\u2212 healthy volunteers, and subjects with latent tuberculosis infection.",

In this study, the following criteria were used for patients with sarcoidosis: 1) clinical features had to be consistent with sarcoidosis (i.e., acute respiratory illness accompanied by erythema nodosum, hilar adenopathy, and arthritis (Lofgren's syndrome), or indolent progressive pulmonary decompensation associated with radiographic findings such as hilar adenopathy, reticulonodular infiltrates, or pulmonary fibrosis); 2) histopathologic diagnosis of sarcoidosis had to be confirmed by a pathologist (i.e., specimens from each patient had confluent noncaseating granulomas, well-circumscribed within the surrounding tissue with a variable amount of peripheral lymphocytic infiltration); and 3) known microbial causes for granuloma formation had to be excluded by histologic staining and culture for bacteria, fungi, and acid-fast bacilli.

            "text": "Previous reports have utilized immune recognition of microbial antigens to identify potential infectious agents (22) . This work demonstrates a Th-1 immune response to Ag85A whole protein and peptides from PBMC of sarcoidosis subjects. Sarcoidosis immunology, epidemiology, and pathology suggest that mycobacteria may be important in its pathogenesis. Because there were immune responses to Ag85A whole protein among subjects with sarcoidosis, two PPD\u2212 healthy volunteers as well as the majority of subjects with latent tuberculosis, MTB Ag85A is unlikely to be \"the sarcoidosis antigen.\" However, the demonstration of immune recognition of this antigen at a significantly higher frequency in sarcoidosis subjects compared to skin test negative healthy volunteers from the same region suggests these responses do not represent reactivity to environmental mycobacteria (Fig. 2) . It is interesting that recent molecular and immunologic studies from independent laboratories around the world have also reported an association between mycobacteria and sarcoidosis, again suggesting that immune recognition secondary to environmental mycobacteria is unlikely (10, 11, 23) . More recently, there are reports of the detection of MTB heat-shock protein antigens in sarcoidosis granulomas as well as Th-1 cellular immune responses to mycobacterial antigens ESAT-6 and katG among sarcoidosis subjects (24, 25) . Mycobacteria has not been found in all sarcoidosis specimens tested, which suggests that sarcoidosis may be a common pathologic phenotype secondary to different etiologies, one of which is mycobacteria. The detection of Th-1 immune responses to mycobacterial Ag85A antigens provides another strong immunologic link of mycobacteria to sarcoidosis immunopathogenesis.",

Tuberculosis subjects are reported to recognize MTB Ag85A peptides 6, 13, 14, 15, 20, and 21; lepromatous patients recognize MTB Ag85A peptides 1, 2, 5, 6, 25, and 28 (13) . It is thought that the dual recognition of MTB Ag85A observed between tuberculosis and leprosy patients is due to the close genetic homology of M. tuberculosis and M. leprae; the unique pattern of recognition reflects that they are distinct. In this study, the PPD+ subjects recognized peptides 14 and 15 most frequently, which was not recognized at all by the sarcoidosis subjects during the initial screening; recognition of peptides 2, 3, 6, and 9 occurred among the PPD+ subjects, but much less frequently than peptides 14 and 15 (Fig. 1) . Testing of the four peptides in the 13 PPD+ subjects from whom PBMC were available revealed that only four of 13 recognized peptides 2, 3, 6, or 9. Among the sarcoidosis subjects, peptides 2, 3, 6, and 9 were recognized in seven of 14 sarcoidosis subjects with many of them recognizing two or more peptides (Table II, Fig. 3) . Prior molecular analysis of sarcoidosis granulomas suggests the presence of Mycobacterium species identical to MTB complex as well as species, which are genetically distinct (23) . It is beyond the capabilities of this study to determine the exact mycobacterial specie(s) the sarcoidosis subjects are responding. Future investigations involving molecular and immunologic analysis for the same mycobacterial protein in a cohort of sarcoidosis subjects is warranted.",

Five of the six sarcoidosis subjects with cutaneous involvement recognized Ag85A as well as both of the subjects with central nervous system involvement (Table II) . Because we are assessing for systemic responses, we cannot comment on the role of mycobacterial antigens in specific sites of sarcoidosis involvement. In addition to recognition of Ag85A whole protein, Th-1 immune responses by individual sarcoidosis subjects to multiple Ag85A peptides were detected. This suggests that consistent with tuberculosis infections, sarcoidosis subjects do not recognize a single dominant epitope(s) but generate a Th-1 immune response tomultiple epitopes. Multiple epitopes from mycobacterial protein(s) may be associated with sarcoidosis immunopathogenesis.",

This study does not purport to identify which Mycobacterium antigen(s) may be important in sarcoidosis pathogenesis, but does provide an immunologic link to mycobacteria with sarcoidosis pathogenesis. Mycobacterial antigens may serve as an inciting stimulus to the immune system, or possible establishment of a persistent infection. Ag85A is the most essential portion of Ag85 complex that facilitates survival of the bacterium within the host macrophage (14) . These findings warrant further investigation of the role of mycobacteria in sarcoidosis pathogenesis. Identification of immunogenic Ag85A peptides among sarcoidosis and PPD+ subjects. Both the sarcoidosis and latent tuberculosis subjects recognized numerous Ag85A peptides, although distinct patterns of peptide recognition were noted between both groups. Of the 29 Ag85A peptides, peptides 14 and 15 were recognized most frequently among the subjects with latent tuberculosis. There was no recognition of these two peptides among the sarcoidosis subjects. Both groups recognized peptides 2, 3, 6, and 9, but these peptides were detected at a higher frequency among the sarcoidosis subjects. Distribution of T cell frequencies for immune recognition of Ag85A by PPD\u2212, sarcoidosis, and PPD+ subjects. The bars represent the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile of each group of study participants. The greatest percentage of subjects, as well as the highest T cell frequencies, was noted in subjects with latent tuberculosis infection. The two PPD\u2212 control subjects who recognized Ag85A whole protein did so at a frequency similar to that observed in the sarcoidosis and PPD+ subjects. Despite negative histology and culture for mycobacteria among the sarcoidosis subjects, the response observed more closely paralleled than that of the PPD+ group. Epitope maps of Ag85A in sarcoidosis subjects. In addition to immune recognition of Ag85A whole protein, we were able to assess for reactivity to four Ag85A peptides among 14 sarcoidosis subjects. Seven of the 14 demonstrated reactivity to one of the four Ag85A peptides. Peptides 3 and 6 were the most frequently recognized peptides. Five subjects had immune recognition of two or more peptides. Despite the lack of reactivity to Ag85A whole protein, sarcoidosis subjects 1 and 3 demonstrated significant recognition to three of four Ag85A peptides. Inhibition of Ag85A whole protein by HLA-DR. Flow cytometry revealed primarily a CD4+ T cell response among sarcoidosis subjects to Ag85A whole protein, which could be inhibited completely by anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody. ELISPOT analysis confirmed that HLA-DR was important in recognition of Ag85A whole protein among sarcoidosis subjects, whereas HLA-DQ and HLA-DP did not appear to have a role in antigen presentation.
