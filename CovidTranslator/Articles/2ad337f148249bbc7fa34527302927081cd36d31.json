In a previously published audit, we demonstrated that one-third of patients admitted to a dedicated isolation room in Tayside were not thought to be an infection risk by experienced healthcare staff. Since this audit, Tayside's isolation facilities have moved from a small peripheral 'fever' hospital to a large central teaching hospital site. At the time of this move, and using the above audit data, we designed and implemented a guideline for general practitioners and hospital doctors regarding the admission of patients to an isolation bed. The aim of this study was to compare the use of isolation beds before and after the move to the new facilities, which we anticipated would increase the demand for isolation. The results show that by all three criteria used, the utilization of isolation beds has deteriorated following the move, mainly due to the increased admission of general medical 'boarders' and low-risk infection patients. At a time when hospital-acquired infections are increasing, NHS trusts should ensure that dedicated isolation beds are used appropriately.",

Although approximately 80% of patients were deemed to have been admitted appropriately according to our local admission guidance (Table I) , many of these patients had low-risk infections, with less than half of all patients thought to be an infection risk. In contrast, prior to the transfer, 90% of patients would have been admitted appropriately according to the admission guidance, with over two-thirds of patients thought to be an infection risk. This deterioration appears to be due to three main factors. Firstly, a higher proportion of isolated patients had low-risk infections, in particular, lower respiratory or urinary tract infections. Secondly, a higher proportion of patients had noninfection, general medical diagnoses. Thirdly, there was a fall in the proportion of patients with gastroenteritis. Whether the latter represents a true reduction in incidence or a change in referral pattern is unknown. Further investigation is merited to ensure that patients with infectious diarrhoea are not being housed inappropriately on open wards.",

From our own experience and that of others, it would seem unlikely that other more appropriate (i.e. higher-risk) patients were not available for transfer either from the medical admissions unit or other parts of the hospital. Unpublished audit data from our own hospital have suggested that if side and isolation rooms were used more appropriately, the vast majority of patients deemed to be at high risk of transmitting an alert infection could be housed in a side or isolation room. Such findings highlight the difficulty of implementing ideal infection control practice in a 'real-world' environment. A more dynamic approach to bed management with improved recognition of the importance of considering infection control issues when housing patients and the use of 'real-time' information technology could potentially improve isolation room use. Although our local guidance for admission of patients to isolation accommodates some lower-risk infection patients, such as those with severe community-acquired pneumonia, the increased proportion of patients with low-risk diagnoses is likely to represent the common misconception that infection units are for patients with any infection. Following this audit, one of the senior infection unit staff attends the medical admissions unit on a daily basis to liaise with the admitting medical team and nursing staff, and to assess and prioritize admission to the infection unit. Anecdotally, this approach appears to have improved the use of isolation beds, although further audit will be required to confirm this.",

The guidance was also presented at medical unit meetings. It is increasingly recognized, however, that a multi-faceted approach (e.g. a combination of reminders, feedback and interactive educational sessions, etc.) may be required for successful implementation. 6 In conclusion, these data show deterioration in the use of dedicated isolation beds following the transfer of facilities to a central teaching hospital site, mainly due to inappropriate admission of lowrisk and general medical patients. In an era when nosocomial infection is increasingly important, National Health Service trusts should ensure that dedicated isolation facilities are used appropriately.",
