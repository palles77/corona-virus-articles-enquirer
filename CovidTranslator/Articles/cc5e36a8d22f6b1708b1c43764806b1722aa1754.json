The r.m.s. deviation between the two free-enzyme structures is 0.53 \u00c5 for all Ca positions of the molecule but the isolated domains exhibit r.m.s. deviations of only 0.31 \u00c5 (domain II) -0.42 \u00c5 (domains I, III) (comparison between the novel coronavirus M pro structure and SARS-CoV M pro , PDB entry 2BX4 (Tan et al., 2005) ). The chymotrypsin-and picornavirus 3C protease-like domains I and II (residues 10-99 and 100-182, respectively) are six-stranded antiparallel b-barrels that harbor the substrate-binding site between them. Domain III (residues 198-303), a globular cluster of five helices, is involved in the regulation of dimer formation of the M pro (Shi & Song, 2006) . 2019-nCoV M pro forms a tight dimer (contact interface, predominantly between domain II of molecule A and the NH2-terminal residues of molecule B (\"N-finger\"): ~1394 \u00c5 2 ), with the two molecules oriented perpendicular to one another ( Fig. 1) . Dimerization of the enzyme is necessary for catalytic activity, because the N-finger of each of the two protomers interacts with Glu 166 of the other protomer and thereby helps shape the S1 pocket of the substrate-binding site (Anand et al., 2002) . To reach this interaction site, the N-finger is squeezed in between domains II and III of the parent monomer and domain II of the other monomer. Interestingly, in the SARS-CoV but not in the 2019-nCoV M pro dimer, there is a polar interaction between the two domains III involving a 2.60-\u00c5 hydrogen bond between the side-chain hydroxyl groups of residue Thr 285 of each author/funder.

It has previously been shown that replacing Ser 284 , Thr 285 , and Ile 286 by alanine residues in SARS-CoV M pro leads to a 3.6-fold enhancement of the catalytic activity of the protease, concomitant with a slightly closer packing of the two domains III of the dimer against one another (Lim et al., 2014) . According to that study, this is accompanied by changes of the structural dynamics of the enzyme that transmit the effect of the mutation to the catalytic center. Indeed, the Thr 285 Ala replacement observed in the 2019-nCoV M pro also allows the two domains III to approach each other a little closer (the distance between the Ca atoms of residues 285 in molecules A and B is 6.77 \u00c5 in SARS-CoV M pro and 5.21 \u00c5 in 2019-nCoV M pro and the distance between the centers of mass of the two domains III shrinks from 33.4 \u00c5 to 32.1 \u00c5).

In addition, 13a showed good metabolic stability using mouse and human microsomes, with intrinsic clearance rates Cl int_mouse = 32.00 \u00b5L/min/mg protein and Cl int_human = 20.97 \u00b5L/min/mg protein. This means that after 30 min, around 80% for mouse and 60% for humans, respectively, of residual compound remained metabolically stable. Pharmacokinetic studies in CD-1 mice using the subcutaneous route at 20 mg/kg showed that 13a stayed in plasma for up to only 4 hrs, but was excreted via urine up to 24 hrs. The Cmax was determined at 334.50 ng/mL and the mean residence time was about 1.59 hrs. Although 13a seemed to be cleared very rapidly from plasma, it was found at 24 hrs at 135 ng/g tissue in the lung and at 52.7 ng/mL in broncheo-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) suggesting that it was mainly distributed to tissue. In the light of the current CoV outbreak, it is advisable to develop compounds with lung tropism such as 13a. However, compared to 11r, the structural modification led to some loss of inhibitory activity against the main protease of 2019-nCoV (IC50 = 2.39 \u00b1 0.63 uM) as well as the 3C proteases of enteroviruses. To enhance the antiviral activity against betacoronaviruses of clade b (2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV), we sacrificed the goal of broad-spectrum activity including the enteroviruses for the time being and replaced the P2 cyclohexyl moiety of 13a by cyclopropyl in 13b, because the S2 pocket of the betacoronavirus main proteases shows a pronounced plasticity enabling it to adapt to the shape of smaller inhibitor moieties entering this site . Here we present X-ray crystal structures in two different crystal forms, at 1.95 and 2.20 \u00c5 resolution, of the complex between aketoamide 13b optimized this way and the M pro of 2019-nCoV (Fig. 2) . One structure is in space group C2, where both protomers of the M pro dimer are bound by crystal symmetry to have identical conformations, the other is in space group P212121, where the two protomers are independent of each other and free to adopt different conformations. Indeed, we find that in the latter crystal structure, the key residue Glu 166 adopts an inactive conformation (as evidenced by its prolonged author/funder. All rights reserved.

This is clearly reflected in the electron density (Fig. 2) ; the stereochemistry of this chiral moiety is S in all three copies of compound 13b in these structures. The oxyanion (or hydroxyl) group of this thiohemiketal is stabilized by a hydrogen bond from His 41 , whereas the amide oxygen of 13b accepts a hydrogen bond from the main-chain amides of Gly 143 , Cys 145 , and partly Ser 144 , which form the canonical \"oxyanion hole\" of the cysteine protease. The P1 g-lactam moiety, designed as a glutamine surrogate (Dragovich et al., 1999; Tan et al., 2013) , is deeply embedded in the S1 pocket of the protease, where the lactam amide nitrogen donates a three-center (bifurcated) hydrogen bond to the main-chain oxygen of Phe 140 (3.20/3.10/3.28 \u00c5; values for the structure in space group C2/space group P212121 molecule A/space group P212121 molecule B) and to the Glu 166 carboxylate (3.35/3.33/ -\u00c5), and the carbonyl oxygen accepts a 2.57/2.51/2.81-\u00c5 H-bond from the imidazole of His 163 . The P2 cyclopropyl methyl moiety is embraced by the S2 subsite, which has shrunk by 28.4 \u00c5 3 compared to a complex between compound 13a with P2 = cyclohexyl methyl and the SARS-CoV M pro (LLZ et al., unpublished) .",

Embedded within the pyridone, the P2 nitrogen can no longer donate a hydrogen bond to the protein; however, our previous crystal structures showed that the P2 mainchain amide of the linear a-ketoamides does not make a hydrogen bond with the protein in all cases, so this interaction does not seem to be essential .
