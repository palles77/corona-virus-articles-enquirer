            "text": "Biological and chemical weapons have been used throughout history. 1 For millennia, indigenous South American peoples deliberately used plant-derived arrow poisons such as curare and toxins from poison dart frogs, although these preparations were used mainly for hunting. Similar toxins were used in Africa. The ancient Greeks, for whom toxikon meant \"arrow poison,\" tipped arrows with winter aconite, and this practice continued into medieval Europe, persisting into the seventeenth century in Spain and Portugal. 2 Soldiers in India used smoke screens, incendiary weapons, and toxic fumes as early as 2000 BCE, and the Sung Dynasty in China employed a wide variety of arsenical smokes and other poisons in battle. The military use of toxins dates from at least the sixth century BCE, when Assyrian soldiers poisoned enemy wells with ergotcontaminated rye. In 423 BCE, during the Peloponnesian War, Thracian allies of Sparta captured the Athenian fort at Delium by using a long tube and bellows to blow poisonous smoke from coals, sulfur, and pitch into the fort. Greek fire (likely composed of rosin, sulfur, pitch, naphtha, lime, and saltpeter) was invented in the seventh century CE and proved to be a very effective naval weapon. Various poisons saw battlefield use during medieval times, and the use of poisons for murder (including assassinations) became widespread. Other examples before the twentieth century include the contamination of water by dumping the corpses of dead humans or animals into wells, the use of snakes and other creatures as poisonous vectors, and occasionally, fomites to transmit infections such as smallpox to unsuspecting victims. This latter technique was used with remarkable success during the French and Indian War (1754-1767), when Sir Jeffrey Amherst was alleged to have given \"gifts\" (blankets) harboring the pus and scabs from smallpox victims to unsuspecting Native Americans. The Indians possessed no immunity against smallpox and thus experienced very high rates of infection and mortality as smallpox swept through the local tribes. 3 During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the science and technology necessary for the development of sophisticated biological and chemical weapons proceeded apace. World War I saw the first large-scale use of \"poison gas,\" including lacrimators, chlorine, phosgene, arsenicals, cyanide, and sulfur mustard. By the end of the war, nearly one in every three rounds was a chemical munition. Dr. Shiro Ishii and other Japanese scientists in the infamous Unit 731 worked on the weaponization of anthrax, plague, smallpox, and tetrodotoxin as well as a variety of chemical agents during World War II. There are even suspicions that the bomb used in the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Czechoslovakia in 1942 contained botulinum toxin. 4 After World War II, ricin was used as an injectable assassination weapon, and in the 1970s and 1980s T-2 toxin, a trichothecene mycotoxin, was alleged to have been the toxic component of the \"yellow rain\" employed against H'Mong refugees from Laos. More recently, Iraq and Iran both used chemical weapons against each other in the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, and Iraq had a weapons program that included the development of sulfur mustard, nerve agents, \"Agent 15\" (an anticholinergic incapacitating agent), botulinum toxin, epsilon toxin from Clostridium perfringens, and aflatoxin. 5 Militia groups in the United States and terrorist groups throughout the world have used ricin for political purposes.",

Since that time, at least 140 nations have either signed or ratified this treaty. 6 However, the Soviet Union and Iraq began violating the treaty in short order. In the Soviet Union, weapons scientists stepped up research and development of numerous biological and chemical weapons as part of one of the largest and most comprehensive biological-weapons programs in history. Soviet scientists created large stockpiles of weaponized anthrax, plague, smallpox, tularemia, nerve agent, mustard, and other biological and chemical agents. 5 In 1979 the world was put on notice of the devastating potential that biological weapons pose to humanity. In that year, a small quantity of weapons-grade anthrax was accidentally released from a manufacturing plant located in the former city of Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) in Russia, resulting in 77 cases and 66 deaths. Dr. Matthew Meselson, a Harvard scientist, was permitted to study the event many years later and reported the results of his work in a 1979 Science article. Meselson determined that the majority of the deaths had occurred among victims living in a narrow, 4-km-wide band downwind from the plant. Animal deaths were confirmed as far as 30 km downwind. Meselson further concluded that less than 1 g of weapons-grade anthrax had been released from the plant. 7 If his calculations are accurate, weaponized anthrax possesses staggering potential as a biological weapon given its stability, its relative ease of production, and its ability to be dispersed in a clandestine manner over great distances.",

More than 5500 people sought medical treatment, and a dozen died. The Aum Shinri Kyo had used sarin in Matsumoto 9 months earlier in an attack that had exposed more than 300 people and killed 7 in an attempt to assassinate judges unfavorable to their cause. 8, 9 The anthrax attacks in the fall of 2001 involved the use of letters containing weapons-grade anthrax mailed through the U.S. postal system. Five people died, and 17 became ill with either cutaneous or inhalational anthrax. Buildings contaminated with spores included the Hart Senate Office building and the Brentwood postal facilities in Washington, DC. It cost millions of dollars to rehabilitate these buildings. The anthrax used in the attacks was determined to be extremely potent and could have caused far greater numbers of casualties had it been dispersed more widely. 10, 11 The use of chemical weapons also occurred in recent history. In September 2013 the United Nations (UN) released their investigations on the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The UN concluded that sarin gas was used on August 21, 2013, in the Ghouta area of Damascus against \"civilians, including children, on a relatively large scale.\" 12 These findings were based on interviews with survivors and other witnesses, documentation of munitions and their components, collection of environmental samples for subsequent analysis, assessment of symptoms of survivors, and collection of hair, urine, and blood samples.",

In addition to weaponizing the etiologic agents of anthrax, smallpox, Marburg fever, and others, they created antibiotic-resistant strains of Yersinia pestis (plague), Francisella tularensis, and other pathogens. Furthermore, by applying genetic engineering techniques, the Soviets are also alleged to have created pathogens with novel characteristics and strains of several organisms capable of defeating certain vaccines. 13 As we enter the biotechnological revolution of the twenty-first century, our understanding of molecular biology, genetics, and biochemistry is exploding. The human genome has been sequenced, and it is now possible to manipulate genes from disparate organisms to create new and novel pathogens. Scientists are also able to synthesize and weaponize a number of different endogenous biological-response modifiers including cytokines, hormones, neurotransmitters, and plasma proteases. But even nature continues to surprise us. New, naturally occurring infections with the potential to cause large-scale human diseases and death continue to emerge at an ever-increasing rate throughout the world, and it is conceivable that these pathogens could also be weaponized by enterprising scientists.",

During the past 20 years, more than 30 new lethal pathogens have been identified. 14 A classic example of this emerging threat is pandemic influenza. In 1918, as World War I was coming to an end, the Spanish flu struck with devastating consequences. In less than 1 year, this virus was able to circumnavigate the globe and kill an estimated 40 million people. 15 More recently, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Southeast Asia resulted from a coronavirus that jumped species from animals to humans and rapidly spread to 29 countries in less than 90 days. Finally, the 2014 outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa, still raging as of this writing, is an example of how devastating these agents can be when they emerge in a region previously na\u00efve to them. Novel and dormant infectious agents such as SARS, influenza, and Ebola appear to be emerging or reemerging with increasing frequency and with greater potential for serious consequences. Many factors contribute to the emergence of new diseases: environmental changes, global travel and trade, social upheaval, and genetic changes in infectious agent, host, or vector populations. Once a new disease is introduced into a suitable human population, it often spreads rapidly and has a devastating impact on the medical and public health infrastructure. If the disease is severe, it may lead to social disruption and have a profound economic impact. Outbreaks of emerging or reemerging diseases may be difficult to distinguish from outbreaks resulting from intentional introduction of infectious diseases for nefarious purposes.",

A recent report in the journal Science linked the influenza virus responsible for the 1918 epidemic to a possible avian origin. 19 If true, avian influenza may pose a much greater danger to human populations than previously reported. The disease presents in humans in a fashion similar to other types of influenza viruses. It usually begins with fever, chills, headaches, and myalgias and often involves the upper and lower respiratory tract with development of cough, dyspnea, and, in severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome. Laboratory findings may include pancytopenia, lymphopenia, elevated liver enzymes, hypoxia, a positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for H5N1, and a positive neutralization assay for H5N1 influenza strain. in vitro studies suggest that the neuraminidase (NA)-inhibitor class of drugs may have clinical efficacy in the treatment and prevention of avian influenza infection. 20",

The pathogenicity of human influenza viruses is directly related to their ability to alter their eight viral RNA segments rapidly; the new antigenic variation results in the formation of new hemagglutinin (HA) and NA surface glycoproteins, which may go unrecognized by an immune system primed against heterologous strains. Two distinct phenomena contribute to a renewed susceptibility to influenza infection among persons who have had influenza illness in the past. Clinically significant variants of influenza A viruses may result from mutations occurring in the HA and NA genes and expressed as 491 CHAPTER 80 Future Biological and Chemical Weapons minor structural changes in viral surface proteins. As few as four amino acid substitutions in any two antigenic sites can cause such a clinically significant variation. These minor changes result in an altered virus able to circumvent host immunity. Moreover, genetic reassortment between avian and human or avian and porcine influenza viruses may lead to the major changes in HA or NA surface proteins known as antigenic shift. In contrast to the gradual evolution of strains subject to antigenic drift, antigenic shift occurs when an influenza virus with a completely novel HA or NA formation moves into humans from other host species. Global pandemics result from such antigenic shifts.",

That year, SARS was responsible for approximately 900 deaths and more than 8000 infections in people from at least 29 countries worldwide. Before a case definition had been clearly established, Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) more than 300 cases of an atypical pneumonia with 5 related deaths, all originated from Guangdong province in China during February 2003. The infection quickly spread as infected patients traveled to Hong Kong and from there to Vietnam, Canada, and other locations. Only eight laboratory-confirmed cases occurred in the United States, but there is concern that the U.S. population is vulnerable to a widespread outbreak of SARS such as the one that occurred in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Toronto, and Taiwan in 2003. 21 A SARS case definition evolved from this initial report to the WHO by Chinese health authorities in February 2003. A case was initially defined by clinical criteria; a suspected or probable case was defined as an illness that included potential exposure to an existing case and fever with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome. In April 2003, a confirmed case was defined as a case from which SARS-CoV was isolated from culture. 22 SARS-CoV infections have an incubation period of 2 to 10 days. Systemic symptoms such as fever and chills followed by a dry cough and shortness of breath begin within 2 to 7 days. Patients may develop pneumonia and lymphopenia by days 7 to 10 of the illness. Most patients with SARS-CoV have a clear history of exposure either to a patient with SARS or to a setting in which SARS-CoV is known to exist. Laboratory tests may be helpful but do not reliably detect infection early during the illness. SARS-CoV should be suspected in patients requiring hospitalization for radiographically confirmed pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome of unknown etiology and one of the following risk factors during the 10 days before the onset of illness: (1) travel to China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan, or close contact with an ill person having a history of such travel; (2) employment in an occupation associated with a risk for SARS-CoV exposure; or (3) inclusion in a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia without an alternative diagnosis.",

All patients admitted to the hospital with suspected pneumonia should receive the following measures: (1) they should be placed in droplet isolation until it is determined that isolation is no longer indicated (standard precautions are appropriate for most community-acquired pneumonias; droplet precautions for nonavian influenza); (2) they should be screened for risk factors of possible exposure to SARS-CoV; and (3) they should be evaluated with a chest radiograph, pulse oximetry, complete blood count, and additional workup as indicated. If the patient has a risk factor for SARS, droplet precautions should be implemented pending an etiologic diagnosis. When there is a high index of suspicion for SARS-CoV disease, the patient should be treated in terms of SARS isolation precautions immediately (including airborne precautions), and all contacts of the ill patient should be identified, evaluated, and monitored. 22 Although ribavirin, high-dose corticosteroids, and interferons have been used in treatment, it is unclear what effect they have had on clinical outcome. No definitive therapy has been established. Empiric antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia following the current American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines is recommended pending etiologic diagnosis. Diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV include antibody testing using an enzyme immunoassay and RT-PCR tests for respiratory, blood, and stool specimens. 23 In the absence of known SARS-CoV transmission, testing is recommended only in consultation with public health authorities. Testing for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumococcus, chlamydia, mycoplasma, and legionella should be conducted, as the identification of one of these agents excludes SARS by case definition. Clinical samples can be obtained during the first week of illness with a nasopharyngeal swab plus an oropharyngeal swab and a serum or a plasma specimen. After the first week of illness, a nasopharyngeal swab plus an oropharyngeal swab and a stool specimen should be obtained. Serum specimens for SARS-CoV antibody testing should be collected when the diagnosis is first suspected and at later times as indicated. An antibody response can occasionally be detected during the first week of illness, is likely to be detected by the end of the second week of illness, and at times may not be detected until more than 28 days after the onset of symptoms. Respiratory specimens from any of several different sources may be collected for viral and bacterial diagnostics, but the preferred specimens of choice are nasopharyngeal washes or aspirates. 23 ",

The Nipah virus was discovered in Malaysia in 1999 during an outbreak of a zoonotic infection, now called Nipah virus encephalitis, involving mostly pigs and some human cases. 25 Hendra, the causative 492 SECTION VII Topics Unique to Terrorist Events and High-Threat Disaster Response agent of Hendra virus disease, was identified in a similar outbreak involving a single infected horse and three human cases in Southern Australia in 1994. 26 It is believed that certain species of fruit bats are the natural hosts for these viruses and remain asymptomatic. Horses and pigs act as amplifying hosts for the Hendra and Nipah viruses, respectively. The mode of transmission from animal to humans appears to require direct contact with tissues or body fluids or with aerosols generated during butchering or culling. Personal protective equipment including gowns, gloves, and respiratory and eye protection is advised for agricultural workers culling infected animal herds. Thus far, human-to-human transmission of these viruses has not been reported. In symptomatic cases, the onset of disease begins with flu-like symptoms and rapidly progresses to encephalitis with disorientation, delirium, and coma. Fifty percent of those with clinically apparent infections have died from their disease. There is currently no approved treatment for these infections, and, therefore, therapy relies heavily on supportive care. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used in past infections, but its effectiveness remains unproven in clinically controlled studies. 27 Although no person-to-person transmission is known to have occurred, barrier nursing and droplet precautions are recommended because respiratory secretions and other bodily fluids are known to harbor the virus. The clinical laboratory should be notified before specimens are sent as these may pose a laboratory hazard. Specimens for viral isolation and identification should be forwarded to a reference laboratory. Requests for testing should come through public health departments, which should contact the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 before sending specimens.",

BRMs include erythropoietins, interferons, interleukins, colonystimulating factors, granulocyte and macrophage colony-stimulating factors, stem cell growth factors, monoclonal antibodies, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and vaccines. 28 A growing understanding of the structure and function of BRMs is driving the discovery and creation of many novel compounds including synthetic analgesics, antioxidants, and antiviral and antibacterial substances. For example, BRMs are being used to treat debilitating rheumatoid arthritis by targeting cytokines that contribute to the disease process. 29 By neutralizing or eliminating these targeted cytokines, BRMs may reduce symptoms and decrease inflammation. BRMs may also be used as anticarcinogens, with the following goals: (1) to stop, control, or suppress processes that permit cancer growth; (2) to make cancer cells more recognizable, and therefore more susceptible, to destruction by the immune system; (3) to boost the killing power of immune system cells, such as T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages; (4) to alter growth patterns in cancer cells to promote behavior like that of healthy cells; (5) to block or reverse the processes that change a normal cell or a precancerous cell into a cancerous cell; (6) to enhance the ability of the body to repair or replace normal cells damaged or destroyed by other forms of cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation; and (7) to prevent cancer cells from spreading to other parts of the body. 30, 31 More of these promising new drugs are currently in development. It can be readily theorized that research to develop various BRMs can be subverted to a malicious end. That is, instead of using BRMs to suppress cancer growth or to decrease disease susceptibility, researchers could develop compounds to cause illness and death. Other drugs could be designed to alter certain metabolic processes or to alter brain chemistry to affect cognition or mood.

            "text": "The threats associated with the use of chemical weapons as battlefield or terrorist weapons are not easy to assess. 43, 44 Risk assessment of use must take into account national laws, international treaties and 493 CHAPTER 80 Future Biological and Chemical Weapons conventions, and the likelihood of adherence to these legal obligations. Loopholes in existing agreements can be exploited to develop weapons that are technically not prohibited by international law. Goals and objectives may vary depending on whether military use is planned at the strategic, tactical, or operational level and whether the developer is a national government, a breakaway republic, a kidnapped or recruited scientist, or a terrorist cell. Risk of use may also depend on whether the targets are military versus civilian, human versus nonhuman (animals or plants, including livestock and crops), or individual (as in assassinations) versus large groups, and on whether the aim is death versus incapacitation. Risk also depends on agent availability and on the technology available for production, storage, and dissemination; current advances in technology are associated with a higher risk of weaponization. Two examples from the twentieth century and one from the twenty-first can illustrate the fallibility of intelligence: 1. During most of World War II, the Allied perception of risk from possible chemical agent use by Axis powers focused on those agents, primarily pulmonary agents and vesicants, known from World War I. In fact, Germany had developed a new kind of chemical-warfare agent, the compounds later to be called G-series nerve agents. Their existence came as a complete surprise to Western governments when, in the waning days of the European campaign, Allied soldiers advancing into Germany discovered buried nerve-agent munitions and entire nerve-agent factories. Why these agents were never used on the battlefield is a topic of much speculation, but in retrospect they clearly posed the most lethal, yet unrecognized, threat from Germany. 45 Report was released and reported that \"while a small number of old, abandoned chemical munitions have been discovered, ISG judges that Iraq unilaterally destroyed its undeclared chemical weapons stockpile in 1991.\" 47 Although the initial intelligence proved to be wrong, it does not invalidate the argument that the risk from these agents, if possessed, would be very concerning. Chemical agents originally used during World War I are sometimes considered obsolete, especially in comparison to the more potent nerve agents and incapacitating agents. However, agent potency is only one part of the story. To deliver the 5 \u03bcg that represents an estimated lethal dose for half of an exposed group (LD 50 ) of the nerve agent VX would seem to be easier than delivering the 3 to 7 g that constitute the LD 50 of sulfur mustard and more difficult than delivering the much smaller lethal doses of toxins such as botulinum toxin. 48 In fact, sulfur mustard is easier to synthesize than is a nerve agent and is easy to disseminate in a clandestine manner to create delayed effects. Thus mustard still lays claim to being the \"King of Gases,\" and it has allegedly been used in a variety of venues since the end of World War II. Most known chemicals with toxicities equal to or greater than that of ammonia could theoretically be used as chemical warfare or terrorism agents.",

Some compounds not developed to cause injury or incapacitation nevertheless can be very dangerous; hexachloroethane (HC) smoke, for example, can cause the same type of pulmonary damage induced by phosgene, a chemical weapon used in World War I. The CDC lists nearly 70 separate chemicals, including a variety of toxic industrial chemicals and poisons, as potential agents for terrorism. These include osmium tetroxide, long-acting anticoagulants, heavy metals, toxic alcohols, and white phosphorus. 49 The April 21, 2000, Morbidity and Mortality Report included an even longer list of chemical agents that might be used by terrorists. 50 Pyrolysis, the thermochemical change of an organic material in the absence of oxygen by heat, and products from explosions and conflagrations may release large quantities of cyanide and other toxicants that, although different from the original chemicals present, may still cause death. Industrial chemicals are readily available in large quantities as preformed compounds and should be considered high on the list of potential terrorist agents. 51, 52 Toxins that are chemicals produced within biological organisms also represent high-threat agents. 53 New chemicals are currently being synthesized on rigid three-dimensional molecular skeletons, the most promising of which are the norbornanes. Norbornane is a bicyclic crystalline hydrocarbon (C7H12). 54 Building on norbornane geometry allows for a modular enhancement of the number of functional sites on a given molecule. Many norbornane derivatives, such as the mixture of chlorobornanes known as the toxaphenes, are persistent and have significant acute and chronic toxicity. These norbornane derivatives have been considered as potential candidates for new agents. Novichok 55-58 (Russian for \"newcomer\") refers to the alleged Russian development of a highly toxic binary nerve agent or generation of nerve agents (sometimes called \"fourth-generation\" agents).

Further investigations of survivors have suggested that carfentanil and remifentanil were possibly used in the siege. 62 Organofluorines have been investigated because of their reported ability to defeat protective-mask or chemical-filtration systems. 38 Other incapacitating agents under development exert primarily physical rather than chemical effects and include immobilizing agents (\"stickums\"), antitraction gels (\"slickums\"), and malodorants. 63, 64 An effective incapacitating agent must be highly potent and reversible. It also must have rapid onset, short duration of action, and a high safety margin. 63 Nontraditional agents (NTAs) are chemicals that do not fall in the traditional chemical weapons category but have been reportedly researched or developed for use as chemical weapons. \"NTAs are novel chemical threat agents or toxicants requiring adapted countermeasures,\" according to Homeland Security Presidential Directive/ HSPD-18. 65 Developing defenses against NTAs is a listed priority for the U.S. Department of Defense. 41 ",

The idea was to make storage of chemical rounds safer by stopping the production process at the penultimate synthetic step, resulting in two precursor compounds that when mixed would create the desired agent. These two precursors could then be stored separately. Just before use, one component could be inserted into a round, where it would be separated from the other precursor by a thin membrane. The impact and momentum of the launch of the projectile would burst the membrane to allow for mixing of the components and in-flight production of the chemical agent. In practice, this process was often not complete, but the 20% or so of ancillary reaction product was often extremely toxic by itself. Binarization or some similar production-arrest method could theoretically be used by a clandestine terrorist cell to help evade detection and to decrease the risks associated with the production, transportation, and use of chemical agents.",

During World War II, Germany explored particularization of sulfur mustard onto small carrier particles of silica (silicon dioxide), although other powdered silicates (e.g., talc, diatomite, and pumice) and clays (e.g., kaolinite and Fuller's earth) can also be used. 68 The advantages of such \"dusty agents\" are increased volatility, facilitation of the movement of relatively nonvolatile agents such as sulfur mustard and the persistent nerve agent VX into the alveoli, and increased penetration of clothing and chemical protective equipment. 31 Iraq used a \"dusty mustard\" composed of 65% sulfur mustard adsorbed onto silica particles ranging in diameter from 0.1 to 10 \u03bcm during its war with Iran.

Targeting unusual sequences of high prevalence in certain populations raises the specter of genomic, or ethnic, weapons, as previously described. Less appreciated is the potential for genomics to be used to develop drugs and chemical or toxin agents that can also be targeted to specific variants within a population of humans, animals, or crops. The widespread availability of genome libraries on the Internet makes it nearly impossible to control or restrict access to the already published genomic libraries on over a hundred microbial pathogens. 79 Proteomics complements genomics by characterizing the protein expression of segments of the genome and by making it easier to develop compounds that target or produce a specific protein. Direct gene insertion, genetic delivery via virus or bacteria, or drug tailoring to affect a given protein can be used. For example, a scorpion toxin has been successfully engineered into a virus that acts as a pesticide against caterpillars. Protein sequences in toxins are partly responsible for resistance to light, oxygen, moisture, and desiccation; the insertion of genes to create altered proteins or the introduction of chemical agents engineered to cause structural changes in expressed proteins could significantly alter the toxicity of a given compound. 77 Furthermore, the widespread use of DNA microarrays (glass slides or chips imprinted with thousands of specific single-stranded DNA sequences) allows for fast-automated screening of candidate compounds.",

It was not until 1998 that Reuters News Agency reported the discovery by British intelligence that Iraq had stockpiled large quantities of a \"mental incapacitant\" (incapacitating agent) known as Agent 15. 18,46 3. The risk of use of chemical agents by Iraq after 2001 was assessed to be high partly because of the known stockpiles of sulfur mustard and nerve agents (as well as the suspected stockpiles of cyanide and the new revelations about Agent 15) from the time of the 1991 Gulf War. President George W. Bush's summary in October of 2002 of the National Intelligence Estimates (NIE) states, \"Baghdad has begun renewed production of mustard, sarin, GF (cyclosarin), and VX. Although information is limited, Saddam probably has stocked at least 100 and possibly as much as 500 metric tons of CW agents.\" However, in 2006 the Iraq Study Group (ISG)",
