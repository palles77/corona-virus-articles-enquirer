Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) is used increasingly to diagnose respiratory infections and has shown to be more sensitive than viral culture and antigen detection. Objective of the present study was to develop a one-step mRT-PCR that could detect 18 respiratory viruses in three sets. The method was compared with real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) for its sensitivity and specificity. Clinical specimens from 843 pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms were used in the study. 503 (59.7%) samples were detected positive by mRT-PCR. Of these 462 (54.8%) exhibited presence of a single pathogen and 41 (4.9%) had multiple pathogens. rRT-PCR detected 439 (52.1%) positive samples, where 419 (49.7%) exhibited one virus and 20 (2.4%) showed co-infections. Concordance between mRT-PCR and rRT-PCR was 91.9% and kappa correlation 0.837. Sensitivity and specificity of mRT-PCR were 99.5% and 83.7% while that of rRT-PCR was 86.9% and 99.4% respectively. Rhinovirus (17.2%) was the most frequently detected virus followed by respiratory syncytial virus B (15.4%), H1N1pdm09 (8.54%), parainfluenza virus-3 (5.8%) and metapneumovirus (5.2%). In conclusion, mRT-PCR is a rapid, cost effective, specific and highly sensitive method for detection of respiratory viruses.",

To enable a rapid response to a potential outbreak, it is desirable to have fast, accurate and comprehensive diagnostic methods that are capable of detecting simultaneously and subtyping viruses. However, it is very expensive to use virus specific PCR assays. Several groups have developed multiplex RT-PCRs to identify respiratory viruses in clinical samples (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Bharaj et al., 2009; Brittain-Long et al., 2010; Coiras et al., 2004; Gunson et al., 2005; Jansen et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2007; Mahony et al., 2007; Pabbaraju et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009) .

Conserved regions of target genes were chosen to design the forward and reverse primers. For mRT-PCR, different viral genes with their PCR product sizes are given in Table 1 . Primer sequences can be provided on request. The above mRT-PCR primers were obtained from Sigma (Bangalore, India). Multiplex RT PCRs were carried out in 3 tubes (sets) (set 1: influenza A, subtype seasonal H1, H3 and pandemic H1 (2009), influenza B; set 2: RSV-A, RSV-B, HMPV, PIV-1, -2, -3; and set 3: PIV-4, corona virus OC43/HKU1, corona virus 229E/NL63, rhinovirus/enterovirus). The mRT-PCR did not differentiate between corona virus OC43 and HKU1; 229E and NL63; and between rhinovirus and enterovirus. Monoplex one step real time RT PCRs (rRT-PCR) for influenza A, subtype seasonal H1, H3, pandemic H1 (2009), influenza B and internal control RnaseP were carried out as per protocol provided by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA (CDC) (CDC protocol, 2009 ). For RSV-A and B, PIV-1, -2, -3, corona virus OC43, 229E, NL63 and rhinovirus, the rRT-PCR assay was performed as described (Gunson et al., 2005) , for HMPV (Maertzdorf et al., 2004) and for PIV-4 as described on the following website www3.appliedbiosystems.com/cms/groups/mcb/cms 088565.pdf. For rRT-PCR, all influenza, RSV-A, rhinovirus, PIV-1, and coronavirus NL63 TaqMan probes were labelled with FAM (fluorescein amidite); RSV-B, PIV-2, -3, -4, coronavirus OC43 and 229E were labelled with VIC.

Previously, detection rates between 43% and 63% have been reported (Brittain-Long et al., 2010; Broor et al., 2007; Coiras et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2009; Mahony et al., 2007; Maitreyi et al., 2000; Yeolekar et al., 2008) .

One case of co-infection with influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses was also detected.

Real time RT-PCR detected 439 (52.1%) positive samples of which 419 (49.7%) were single infection and 20 (2.4%) were co-infections (supplementary",
