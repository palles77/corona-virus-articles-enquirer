This study described acute kidney injury (AKI) at early stage of COVID-19 and its clinical significance. Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients with were recruited and clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Patient's prognosis was tracked and risk factors of AKI was analyzed. Of 355 COVID-19 patients, common, severe and critical ill cases accounted for 63.1%, 16.9% and 20.0%, respectively. On admission, 56 (15.8%) patients were with AKI. Although AKI was more common in critical ill patients with COVID-19, there was no significant association between oxygenation index and renal functional indices among COVID-19 patients with AKI. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and comorbidity with diabetes were three important independent risk factors predicting AKI among COVID-19 patients. Among 56 COVID-19 patients with AKI, 33.9% were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Fatality rate was obviously higher among COVID-+19 patients with AKI than those without AKI (RR=7.08, P<0.001). In conclusion, male elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes are more susceptible to AKI. AKI at early stage may be a negative prognostic indicator for COVID-19.",

On February12, 2020, the International Committee on SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted by droplets or direct contact and infected through respiratory tract 2 . In addition, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted by feces 3 . Accumulating data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter human cells, mainly pulmonary epithelial cells, and probably cardiomyocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells [4] [5] [6] . The main symptoms and signs of COVID-19 patients are fever, companied by dry cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, fatigue and lymphopenia [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Although only a few cases died in mild COVID-19 patients, death risk was rapidly increased among critical ill patients with the fatality rate even more than 50% 12 . A large number of clinical data have revealed that infection with SARS-CoV-2 not only causes severe acute respiratory syndrome but also multiple organ injuries, including myocardial dysfunction, hepatic injury and even acute renal failure (AKI) 13 . Nevertheless, what factors influence the multiple organ injuries, especially AKI, during the pathogenesis of COVID-19 remains unclear. Moreover, the clinical significance of AKI needs to be further clarified.",

Continuous variables were shown using median and mean values. Means for continuous variables were compared with independent-samples t tests when the data were normally distributed; if not, the Mann-Whitney test was used. Proportions for categorical variables were compared with the chi-square and Fisher's exact test. Univariable logistic regression between basic disease or different parameter and demise was performed. Moreover, the main risks related with demise were examined using multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Statistical significance was determined at P\uff1c0.05.",

The Second People's Hospital of Fuyang City is one of COVID-19designated hospitals in Anhui province. The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University sent a specialist group to guide COVID-19 treatment. All COVID-19 patients were clinically diagnosed on basis of typical clinical manifestations accompanied with characteristic chest radiology changes. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA and confirm infection with SARS-CoV-2. The patient with negative result on SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was excluded from this study.

In the present study, we analyzed AKI at the early stage of COPIDsuggest an association between AKI at the early stage and the severity of COVID-19 patients.Increasing evidence demonstrated that elderly COVID-19 patients were more serious15,16 . In the present study, we analyzed the impact of gender and age on AKI at the early stage of COVID-19. We showed that the levels of serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid were higher in males than those of females. Moreover, the levels of serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid were higher in old patients over 70 years old than those of younger patients. Several reports showed that COVID-19 patients with comorbidities were more serious. Indeed, the present study found that more than half of COVID-19 patients were with either diabetes or hypertension. Thus, it is especially whether COVID-19 patients with either diabetes or hypertension are more susceptible to AKI. Unexpectedly, there was no difference on renal functional indices between COVID-19 patients with hypertension and without hypertension.Interestingly, urea nitrogen and uric acid were higher in COVID-19 patients with diabetes than those without diabetes. To exclude potential confounding factors, multivariable logistic regression was used to further analyze the impact of gender, age and comorbidities on AKI at the early stage of COVID-19. Our results indicated that male, older age and comorbidity with diabetes were major risk factors of AKI at the early stage of COVID-19 patients. Taken together, these results suggest that male elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus are more susceptible to AKI.",
