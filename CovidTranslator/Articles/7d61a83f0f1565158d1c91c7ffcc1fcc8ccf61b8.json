In the case-control study we choose to determine Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration as a marker of lipid peroxidation index (oxidative stress) spectrophotometrically and quantify HIV mRNA by Real Time-nucleic acid sequence based amplification assay (RT-NASBA). Here our result show for the first time a high concentration of lipid peroxidation product (MDA, 116.6%) with a significant (P \\ 0.05) increase in HIV serodiscordant seropositive subjects over their seronegative partners. However, Spearman rank correlation statistics of SSP group showed a positive correlation value (P \\ 0.01, r = 0.89) between MDA and mRNA and a negative correlation between MDA and T-cell ratio (P \\ 0.01, r = 0.96).The study may strongly indicate a possible lipid peroxidation product threshold for predicting HIV infection and progression in serodiscordant heterosexual partners.",

HIV serodiscordant infection exists where one sexual partner after being repeatedly exposed to the HIV seropositive partner remains seronegative [2] . These are individuals who are repeatedly exposed to HIV through different routes of exposure but persistently remain seronegative [3] . They are thus referred to as serodiscordant-seronegatives or elite controllers possessing natural resistance to HIV infection [4] though the HIV infection has a highly variable latent period of disease that averages 9-10 years in length [5, 6] . In about 80% of HIV infected individuals, AIDS develop within the median time of 10 years, thus are referred to as typical progressors (TP), in about 10% it develops within 2-3 years of infection ''rapid progressors'' (RP) [7] . It has also been observed that about 5-10% of infected people remain asymptomatic for about 7-20 years after infection despite being on no antiretroviral therapy. Their immune function is well controlled with CD4? lymphocyte counts above 600/mm 3 and also a low plasma HIV-mRNA.",

However, transmission was shown to be rare at viral load \\1,500 copies/ml [8] . The higher the concentration of human immunodeficiency virus in the blood stream of an individual the greater the risk of transmitting the virus to a sexual partner during heterosexual intercourse. Consequently, it has been demonstrated that the no of copies (1,000 copies/ml as being potentially infectious threshold) of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in the blood, an indicator of viral load was a better predictor of transmission of HIV when compared to other factors, such as host, viral factors and the presence of sexually transmitted diseases [9] . Present data indicates that in a heterosexual encounter in which one of the sexual partners is HIVpositive, the probability of transmitting the virus to an uninfected partner is 0.11%, according to data analysis from rural Rakai, Uganda [10] .",

Separately they generated sets of data to support the fact that increased expression of HIV messenger RNA (mRNA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells predicts HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Indeed, detection of HIV mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (multiply spliced) has been found to strongly predict HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Although, generally correlating with the immunologic status of the person being tested, the results of this test had a predictive power independent of CD4 cell counts. However, data associating lipid peroxidation to HIV mRNA and T-cell ratio as a predictive power of the infection process and progression rate is rare.",

            "text": "Oxidative stress and over production of inflammatory cytokines has also been shown to increase disease progression of HIV/AIDS patients. This may result from poor nutrition (mostly diet deficient in antioxidants) [15] , psychological stress [16] , chemical toxicity from dye and environment [17] , and microbial activity (from multiple or concurrent infections). The lipid peroxidation index malondialdehyde (MDA) is used as a measure of oxidative stress in cells. Lipid peroxidation being a free radical reaction occurs when hydroxyl radicals possibly oxygen reacts with the unsaturated lipids of bio-membranes resulting in the generation of lipid peroxide radical (ROO \u2022 ), lipid hydroperoxide (ROOH) and fragmentation products such as Malondialdehyde (MDA) [18, 19] . To infect cells, the membrane enveloped HIV transfers its genome both across the viral and cellular membranes, causing them to fuse and provide portal of entry [20] . Membrane lipids therefore are required for HIV-entry. Peroxidation of lipids can have numerous effects including; increased membrane rigidity, decreased activity of membrane bound enzymes, altered activity of membrane receptors (sodium pumps), altered permeability (increased permissibility), formation of hydrophobic centers which, may approach the external phase, alteration of protein structure, mutagenicity (resulting from DNA/RNA damage or bonding), and inhibition of growth and protein synthesis. This is due to the high nucleophilic properties, which enable them to react with electrophilic sites such as amino and thiol groups. Reactive oxygen species (ROS, hydroxyl radicals (HO \u2022 ), superoxide anions (O 2 \u2022 ), nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), are constantly generated in aerobic organism in response to both external and internal stimuli [21] .",

Variations in HIV coreceptor molecules, notably cysteine cysteine receptor no. 5 (CCR5) (responsible for penetration and entry of HIV), influences both HIV susceptibility and disease progression. A mutant allele of CCR5 with a 32-base-pair deletion (CCR5-delta-32) has been found in the highly exposed group of seronegative individuals who are naturally resistant to HIV [26] . This is frequent in populations of European origin (15-20% of Caucasians are heterozygous, and 1% are homozygous), and encodes a non-functional truncated protein that is not transported to the cell surface. Those homozygote for the delta-32 allele exhibit a strong, complete, resistance to HIV infection, whereas heterozygotes delay progression to AIDS as seen in LTNP [27] . However, this mutation does not occur in populations of African and some Asian origins. From previous studies, vigorous virus-specific humoral and cell mediated immune responses have been detected in HIV challenged cells. High titers of potent neutralizing antibodies have been found in sera of LTN's with strong CD8? cytotoxic T-lymphocyte cells [28, 29] . Other host factors include members of the APOBEC family of cellular polynucleotide cytidine deaminases (e.g., APOBEC3G) which are potent inhibitors of HIV infection [30, 31] . However, these failed to give a holistic basis for such variation in HIV infection mostly, in black Africans that are naturally resistant to the virus. Other lipid peroxidation markers such as isoprostanes and 4-HNE have been linked mostly in neurodegenerative diseases or neurologic conditions [32] [33] [34] .",

            "text": "Increased lipid peroxidation has been severally reported in HIV infection [35] [36] [37] [38] . However, the 116.6% increase of MDA found in the HIV seropositive subjects in this study may suggest an overwhelming lipid peroxidation process which consequently indicates high oxidative stress condition. The increased concentration of MDA values in HIV serodiscordant seropositive subjects thus observed is in consonance with the normally expected response that results in increased neutrophils and leucocytes that supposedly occur during acute HIV infection. This increase then indicates that excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) may have been generated in part by the respiratory bursts that occurs in neutrophils. Moreso, the production of oxidants may have resulted from the stimulatory effects of gp 120 (a HIV glycoprotein) and tat (the HIV viral-transactivator protein) during the course of infection, as Westendrop et al. [39] reported that HIV oxidant production is through the stimulatory effects of gp120 and tat, the viral transactivation protein. The increase in OS may have increased HIV replication as observed in the serodiscordant-seropositive partners. This could be through the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) induction possibly by H 2 O 2 (an oxidant) which, activates Nuclear factor-j binding (NF-jB). NF-jB promotes HIV replication indirectly by activation of gene products that further promote OS formation. Droge et al. [40] noted that OS increases the replication of HIV and the amount of certain cytokines, among them TNF-a through the activation of NF-jB. We have to mention here the numerous reports on increased oxidative stress condition in HIV infection, both on antiretroviral therapy (ART) patients which, was reported to increase protein oxidation and preexistent OS and also on ART na\u00efve subjects, these reports were mostly on the HIV disease progression [41, 42] . Suresh et al. [43] observed that the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and lipid peroxidation evaluated in HIV-1 seropositive patients show severe oxidative stress conditions when compared with controls, and increased significantly with the progression of disease in HIV-1 symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. However the distinguishing aspect of our work implies the use of the biochemical entities (MDA and mRNA) as a potent marker of HIV infection process as well as the progression of the disease using serodiscordant heterosexual partners of black origin as subjects. Measurement of HIV mRNA is usually done using the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [44] . Detection and Measurement of cell-associated RNA species using reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is not now routinely done in hospitals or commercial clinical laboratories. One significant question is whether this technology can be successfully transferred to the clinical laboratory. This however necessitated our use of nucleic acid based sequencing method for the study. Also, the need to handle cells and process labile RNA molecules complicates the task. It is of note that alternative tests capable of measuring viral RNA within circulating virions in plasma are becoming more widely available. According to Dewar et al. [45] , NASBA has been introduced into medical diagnostics, where it has been shown to give quicker results than PCR, and it can also be more sensitive [46] [47] [48] . The NASBA technique has been used to develop rapid diagnostic tests for several pathogenic viruses with single-stranded RNA genomes, e.g. influenza A [49] , foot-and-mouth [50] . However, the elevated HIV mRNA (9800 \u00b1 900 IU/ml) and MDA concentration (1.82 \u00b1 0.5 lg/ml) observed in the SSP subjects in this study probably support the assertion that OS increases HIV replication. The positive correlation of MDA and mRNA (P \\ 0.01, r = 0.89) in SSP subjects indicates a linear relationship. This tends to show that lipid peroxidation (OS) may facilitate HIV replication, thus the viral infection process.",

The result shows a decline in the T-cell ratio of the SSP subjects by 40% over their SSN partners and by 140% when compared to that of SNH subjects. This shows that there are more CD8? than CD4? cells in the SSP and SSN groups when compared with the SNH group. As a measure of the immune status of an individual, this result suggests a stronger immune response to HIV infection in the SSN over their SSP partners. These results support the hypothesis that lipid peroxidation plays a role in the immunological abnormalities observed in experimental cells [51] .",

However, the activities of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) induction, activation of NF-jB and their role in activating gene products responsible for OS needs to be further investigated in serodiscordant HIV subjects.",
