In some cases, field strains of IBV can associate with renal and reproductive infections, producing severe nephritis, and causing severe damage to the oviduct and result in decreased or permanent loss of production and poor egg quality (Balestrin et al., 2014) . The virus is transmitted by the airborne route, by direct contact via the respiratory tract from infected chickens, which may travel several kilometers or indirectly through mechanical spread, such as contaminated feed and drinking water, equipment, eggs, working personnel and trucks (Cavanagh et al., 2002) .",

For this reason, the analysis of the S1 gene is the most useful strategy to differentiate IBV genotypes and serotypes, because it correlates closely with the serotype and permits the selection of the appropriate vaccinal serotypes for IB control in each geographic region (Jackwood, 2012) .",

Indeed, a large number of IBV variants in Egypt were recognized and strains related to the Massachusetts (Mass) D3128, D274 and 4/91 genotypes have been detected at different poultry farms in Egypt (Abdel-moneim et al., 2002; Sediek, 2010) . Subsequently, the Egyptian variants ''Egypt/Beni-Seuf/01\" isolated from H120 vaccinated broiler flocks, and Israeli variant ''Israel/720/99\", represent a new IBV genotype that is suggested to be assigned as Egypt/Beni-Seuf (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2006) . Around the year 2012, five IBV isolates formed a distinct phylogenetic group with the ''Egypt/Beni-Suef/01\" variant (Var1), and designate that ''Ck/Eg/BSU-2/2011\" and ''Ck/Eg/BSU-3/2011\" can be considered a new IBV variant (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2012) . All the IBVs variants circulating in Egypt during 2012 were classified into two variant groups; the first group was clearly variant from ''IS/885\" strain and the second group was related to as 4/91 and CR/88121 variants vaccine strains . Other Egyptian variants have also been isolated, named ''IBV-CU2-sp1\" and ''Eg/12120s/2012\" (Afifi et al., 2013; Arafa et al., 2013) .",

Subsequently, several reports confirmed the IBV strains related to the Massachusetts and to 4/91 genotypes have been detected at different poultry farms in Morocco (Alarabi, 2004; El Bouqdaoui et al., 2005) . Recently, an epidemiological survey showed the emergence of a novel strain of Italy02 serotype with a prevalence of 32%, cocirculating with two serotypes; Massachusetts and 4/91, with a prevalence of 66% and 2%, respectively, that are isolated from vaccinated and unvaccinated chicken flocks (Fellahi et al., 2015a) . In addition, three unique IBV isolates ''IBV/ Morocco/30\", ''IBV/Morocco/38\", and ''IBV/Morocco/01\" were characterized using partial S1 sequence analysis, and revealed only a few changes in amino acid composition of S1 protein, thus forming a distinct cluster with the Spanish isolates of the Italy 02 genotype, and the author suggests that a new genotype, represented by the three new IBV isolates described, has been circulating in Morocco since at least 2010 (IBV/Morocco/30) (Fellahi et al., 2015b) . This seemed the case for Tunisia, three IBV variants nominated as ''TN20/00\", ''TN200/01\", and ''TN335/01\" isolated from different Tunisian poultry farms, were very different from the Mass H120 vaccinal strain, but closely related to Mass types found in Europe such as D274 and CR88121 serotypes (Bouroga\u02c6a et al., 2009 ). In addition, two other new Tunisian IB variants ''TN296/07\", ''TN556/07\" isolated during 2007-2010, were also very distant from the reference IBV serotypes, in particular the H120 strain Bouroga\u02c6a et al., 2009 Bouroga\u02c6a et al., , 2012 .",

S1 gene analysis demonstrated that the IBV variants designated as ''IBV/Libya/8-2012\", ''IBV/Libya/1-2012\", ''IBV/Libya/7-2012\" and ''IBV/Libya/3-2012\" in Libyan broiler flocks, formed a separate cluster with the Egyptian strains ''CK/Eg/BSU-2/2011\", ''CK/Eg/BSU-3/2011\" and ''Eg/1212B\", and the isolate named ''IBV/Libya/5-2012\" formed another cluster, with 100% relatedness to ''Eg/CLEV B-2/IBV/012\" and ''IS/1494/06\" strains. In the other hand, new IBV variants were recently identified in Algerian poultry farms called ''Algeria/26/b1\", ''Algeria/26/b2\"and ''Algeria/26/b3\", that are different from the strains isolated in neighboring countries, and this could suggest the existence of a new IBV genotype in North Africa. In Western Africa, a novel variant 'IBADAN' has been described between 2002 and 2007 in Nigeria and Niger, and referenced genome is ''NGA/A116 E7/2006\", which is antigenically and genetically different to other known IBVs (Ducatez et al., 2009) . Some serotypes of IBV, such as Qx-like virus which it is highly pathogenic, continues to be a problem in many countries, and there is evidence that it has emerged for the first time in South part of the African continent (Zimbabwe) (Toffan et al., 2011) . Meanwhile, two different isolates of IBV, ''CkZa/5315/11\" and ''CkZa/4916/11\", were identified in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) during 2011-2012 (Knoetze et al., 2014) .",

The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of these African IBVs were blasted and compared with the reference strains emerged in different African countries ( Table 2 ). The pair-wise comparison (Table 2 ) and the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) of highly variable regions HVR1 and HVR2 sequences, revealed that these IBV viruses can be classified into two distinct groups: Group I consisted of six IBV variants of three clusters (cluster of Morocco, Algeria and Nigeria), which included Moroccan-G/83, Algeria/26/b1, Algeria/26/b2, Algeria/26/b3, NGA/293/2006 and NGA/ A116E7/2006, these variants belong to 4/91, Mass strains (Ma5 and M41) and Qx-like. IBV variant ''Moroccan-G/83\" which is closely related to 4/91 (Jones et al., 2004) , has a nucleotide sequence identity of 76%, 76.9% and 78.3% with Algeria/26/b1, NGA/293/2006 and NGA/A116E7/2006, respectively. Besides, the nucleotide and amino acid sequences identities of Nigerian isolates with others from the neighboring countries, like Algeria and Morocco, was ranged between 75% and 79%, and between 70% and 77% when compared to Algeria/26/b1 and Moroccan-G/83. Moreover, these low identities found between these variants, revealed that the cited countries don't have commercial exchanges of poultry or contaminated birds migration. Group II consisted of three clusters of the especially variants of Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco, which most of them had a close relationship with H120 and Italy02 strains (Figs. 1-3) . The cluster of the Tunisian variants including TN296/07 and TN556/07 genotypes appeared to be very closely related to TN200/01 with highest nucleotide and amino acid TN556/07 identities of 85.3% and 71.6%, but the TN200/00 was branched separately from all Tunisian variants with 75.6% of nucleotide and 71.6% amino acid identities. These variants, when compared to the Egyptian variants, show a nucleotide sequences identities ranged between 74% and 79% and an identity of 68-80% in amino acid level. Furthermore, phylogenetic tree demonstrates that the Egyptian and Tunisian isolates, were closer to Mass Fig. 1 Phylogenetic tree of all IBV variant isolated from different parts in Africa. The tree analysis is based on comparison of the partial nucleotide sequence of the S1 gene containing the highly variable regions HVR1 and HVR 2 (located between 146 and 546 nucleotide) showing the relationship between the African IBV variants and selected reference strains. The phylogenetic tree analysis was conducted by the neighbor-joining (Kimura two-parameter) method with 1000 bootstrap replicates implemented in Neighbor from the PHYLIP package (v3.66). Numbers along the branches refer to bootstrap values. H120 than Italy02 serotype, this was also confirmed by the pair-wise comparison of the deduced proteins sequences (80.5%) (Fig. 4) .",

These variants circulating and evolving in Africa since several years are still not studied enough in the genetic and antigenic levels. Besides, the pathotype variation and dynamics of genotypes within time for a specific region in Africa need as well to be investigated. In brief, all these analyses of partial S1 gene sequences of IBV variants circulating in Africa that are mentioned in this paper, revealed a possible dissemination of IBV between the neighboring countries, but little is known about the mode of IBV spread. However, crossborder movements of poultry and poultry-related products are likely an important factor. With these considerations in mind, the topic of how to type this large number of IB found in various countries, and relate this to the best vaccination strategy to use to protect against them is clearly complex.",
