The nasolacrimal duct narrows at this flexure in normal rabbits. The duct then follows the ventral margin of the nasoturbinates and exits on the ventromedial aspect of the alar fold just caudal to the mucocutaneous junction of the nares.",

In normal rabbits with no ocular or respiratory disease, the most frequently isolated organisms from the conjunctival cul de sac include Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, and Bacillus species. Less common organisms include Bordetella, Stomatococcus, Neisseria, Pasteurella, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, and Moraxella species. 14 However, Pasteurella multocida is a cause of conjunctivitis, epiphora, nasolacrimal duct obstruction, and dacryocystitis in rabbits. 27, 38 A wide variety of other infectious agents also have been associated with conjunctivitis in rabbits, including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas species, Haemophilus species, Treponema paraluiscuniculi, mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, and myxoma virus. 27, 45, 60 In New Zealand white rabbits with conjunctivitis, upper respiratory disease, and pneumonia, bacterial isolates consisted of Bordetella broncheptica, P. multocida, S. aureus, and Pseudomonas alcaligenes. 50 Mucopurulent conjunctivitis and blepharitis with corneal ulceration have been associated with S. aureus infection in a rabbit. 45 Treatment with topical gentamicin ophthalmic ointment and systemic gentamicin was curative. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was isolated in a rabbit with severe bilateral conjunctivitis. (K. Quesenberry, personal communication). Other causes of conjunctivitis in rabbits include foreign bodies, entropion, distichia, trichiasis, and high ammonia or dust content in the environment. Dental disease, including root elongation and dental abscesses, is also associated with conjunctivitis.",

            "text": "Unilateral or bilateral epiphora can be present in rabbits without conjunctivitis. The discharge often has a white, gritty appearance and may be intermittent and resistant to treatment with topical antibiotics. Root elongation of the maxillary incisors is a common underlying cause. 27 The elongated roots can cause an obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct at its flexure just caudal to the roots of the incisors. Radiographs of the skull are needed to assess the incisors; excess curvature of the incisor roots is abnormal. In one report describing two affected rabbits and 13 normal rabbits, radiographs revealed a cystic dilation of the nasolacrimal duct immediately caudal to the duct flexure, and the incisors were more arched than in normal rabbits. 38 Irrigation of the nasolacrimal duct in affected rabbits yielded opaque, white, gritty fluid which, on cytologic examination, showed numerous macrophages, lipid-laden mesothelial cells, lipid droplets, and small numbers of bacteria and erythrocytes. Occlusion of the ducts was presumed to be attributed to fat droplets. Bacteriologic culture of fluids used to irrigate the nasolacrimal ducts of both normal and affected rabbits yielded similar bacterial isolates; therefore microorganisms may not be important in the pathogenesis of epiphora in rabbits. The most common bacterial isolates were S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, Moraxella and Neisseria species, Oligella urethralis, and Streptococcus viridans. In a study of 28 cases of dacryocystitis in rabbits, 89% of cases were unilateral. The cause was determined to be dental malocclusion in 50%, no apparent cause in 35%, rhinitis in 7%, both rhinitis and dental malocclusion in 4%, and panophthalmitis in 4%. Most animals (98%) were treated with topical antibiotics, with a mean duration of 5.8 weeks. 21 In rabbits with epiphora, the diagnostic value of bacterial culture of the irrigation fluid is questionable. However, bacterial culture is recommended if nasal discharge is present in conjunction with epiphora. Skull radiographs are useful to detect underlying dental disease. Dacryocystorhinography using contrast material injected into the nasolacrimal system can help localize the site of obstruction, differentiate between a complete and partial obstruction, and identify any dilation.",

Recurrence of the obstruction is common, and duct irrigation may need to be repeated every 2 to 3 days or weekly until a few consecutive clear irrigations are obtained. If topical antibiotic therapy is used, a broad-spectrum medication such as triple antibiotic solution is recommended. Topical nonsteroidal, antiinflammatory ophthalmic medications, such as 0.03% flurbiprofen or 0.1% diclofenac, may help minimize irritation caused by the procedure. In rabbits with chronic or severe infections, concurrent topical ophthalmic and systemic antibiotic therapy may be needed.

Ophthalmic examination reveals a circular membrane that originates at the limbus (the junction of the cornea and sclera) and gradually advances over the cornea. In severe cases, only a small central opening is present, allowing visibility of an otherwise normal globe. The membrane does not adhere to the cornea. The cause of this condition is unknown, although trauma has been suggested. Progressive membranous occlusion in rabbits has been compared with pterygium in humans. However, in humans the membrane is triangular and adherent to the cornea, whereas in rabbits it is nonadherent and circumferential from the limbus. Treatment with topical antibiotic or antibiotic-steroid medications has no effect. The membrane can be resected surgically and treated with topical antibiotics postoperatively; this usually results in quick recurrence of the membrane. However, if the membrane is resected a few millimeters beyond the limbus and the eye is then treated with a topical antibiotic-steroid combination, recurrence may be prevented. Good results have also been obtained with surgical resection and the use of topical cyclosporine with or without corticosteroids. 57 Another described surgical technique is to incise the membrane into four to six quadrants and suture each quadrant of the membrane to the inside of the eyelid. 3, 59 With this technique, recurrence may be prevented for at least 1 year.",

Many rabbits infected with E. cuniculi are asymptomatic, but neurologic signs can include convulsions, tremors, torticollis, paresis, and coma. Encephalitozoon cuniculi infection has also been associated with phacoclastic uveitis. 20, 23, 63 Most affected rabbits are young (less than 2 years of age), and dwarf rabbits appear predisposed to this disease. Clinically, a white mass is often seen protruding into the anterior chamber ( Fig. 37-4 ). Careful examination of the anterior segment of the eye with slit-lamp biomicroscopy may reveal a break in the anterior lens capsule. The break is frequently hidden by inflammatory material and it may appear as if only the iris is involved in the inflammatory process. A focal cataract is often present in the area of the anterior lens capsule break. Signs of a severe pyogranulomatous anterior uveitis are usually present, such as conjunctival hyperemia, a swollen hyperemic iris, miosis, aqueous flare, and low intraocular pressure. The posterior segment of the eye is initially normal; however, if left untreated, severe uveitis and cataract formation can lead to blindness and possible phthisis bulbi or glaucoma. An abscess in the iris caused by P. multocida initially may resemble phacoclastic uveitis. Measurement of serum antibody titers for E. cuniculi and P. multocida may aid in the differential diagnosis. The treatment of choice is surgical removal of the lens by phacofragmentation. Because of the rabbit's ability to regenerate a lens after this procedure, insertion of an artificial lens after phacofragmentation is not recommended. Systemic treatment of E. cuniculi with albendazole (30 mg/kg PO q24h for 30 days, then 15 mg/kg PO q24h for an additional 30 days) has been reported. 63 Fenbendazole (20 mg/kg q24h for 28 days) has proved effective in both preventing experimental E. cuniculi infection in rabbits and treating naturally infected seropositive rabbits. 64 If the lens is not removed surgically, control of the uveitis with topical steroidal (such as 1% prednisolone acetate) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications as well as systemic fenbendazole or albendazole is necessary. Enucleation may be indicated if the uveitis cannot be controlled medically and a chronically painful eye is present. 23, 74 Spontaneous cataract formation is rare in rabbits. One report describes a low incidence of juvenile cataracts in laboratory New Zealand white rabbits. 49 Keratitis caused by Shope fibroma virus has been reported in one rabbit. 32 Cataracts developed 3 months after the keratitis, which may have been hereditary in origin and unrelated to the virus. Cataract and subsequent glaucoma can develop subsequent to ocular trauma, such as cat-scratch injury. Intraocular sarcomas have been described in two adult rabbits; one had a nonvisual eye associated with chronic inflammation and the second had chronic uveitis, cataract formation, and glaucoma. 42 In both rabbits, intraocular spindle cell neoplasms closely associated with lens and lens capsular fragments were described. The histologic features of the tumors closely resembled posttraumatic ocular sarcomas in cats; chronic inflammation and trauma were considered as probable causes.",

Topical glaucoma medications used in dogs, such as 0.5% timolol maleate and 2% dorzolamide, may also be used in rabbits. Because response to therapy is unpredictable in rabbits, carefully monitor the intraocular pressure during treatment.

            "text": "An abscess in the retrobulbar space of a rabbit can be very difficult to treat. Because of the thick nature of the abscessed material and the anatomy of the alveolar bulla, drainage of the abscess through the mouth, as performed in dogs and cats, may or may not be successful. If the abscess is caused by an abscessed tooth root, the tooth or teeth must be extracted to allow drainage and the rabbit treated with long-term systemic antibiotic therapy. In some cases aggressive surgical debridement may be necessary. This may include exenteration of the orbit and sacrifice of a sighted eye. Even with aggressive surgical and medical management, the prognosis for recovery is always guarded. Stomatoscopy-aided dental trimming, tooth removal, and debridement successfully treated a retrobulbar abscess in a rabbit. 39 Anecdotal reports suggest that some rabbits with retrobulbar abscesses respond to medical therapy with long-term (3-month) administration of benzathine/procaine penicillin G (for rabbits < 2.5 kg, 75,000 U per rabbit SC q48h; for rabbits > 2.5 kg, 150,000 U per rabbit SC q48h). 56 Bilateral exophthalmos in rabbits is commonly associated with compromised vascular drainage of the head. Periodic exophthalmos is common in rabbits with thymomas (see Chapter 20) . 34, 53, 68 In one report, a localized myasthenia gravis associated with the thymoma was suggested as a cause. 68 More probably, the presence of a large intrathoracic mass causes cranial vena cava syndrome, in which the mass compresses vessels in the cranial thorax. 53 This compression impedes blood flow in the right and left cranial vena cava as well as the external jugular veins and causes decreased vascular drainage from the head. Exophthalmos was also reported in a rabbit after the chronic placement of an external jugular catheter, 29 and bilateral exophthalmos can develop with thrombosis of both jugular veins. The external jugular veins are the largest vessels draining the head, whereas the internal jugular veins of rabbits are relatively small and primarily drain the brain, throat, and neck regions. Therefore occlusion of the external jugular veins will compromise vascular drainage of the head. In clinical cases, exophthalmos secondary to venous thrombosis often resolves spontaneously, presumably after the jugular veins become patent again. Exophthalmos in obese rabbits may be caused by excessive fat deposition in the orbit.",

Topical 1% tropicamide may have to be applied to evaluate the fundus. Like dogs and cats, ferrets have a holangiotic retinal vascular pattern. The projection of retinal ganglion cells from the temporal area of the retina in albino ferrets differs from that of pigmented ferrets. 48 In pigmented ferrets, 6,000 retinal ganglion cells project ipsilaterally to the brain, whereas in albino ferrets, only 1,500 retinal ganglion cells project ipsilaterally. The significance of this difference has not been established. Intraocular pressure can be measured with a tonopen (Tono-Pen XL, Reichart, Inc., Dewpew, NY). Normal values for intraocular pressure range from 14.5 \u00b1 3.3 46 to 22.8 \u00b1 5.5 mm Hg. 58 Tear production in normal ferret eyes is less than in dogs, with an average of 5.3 \u00b1 1.3 mm/min measured by commercially available strips. 46 Conjunctivitis in ferrets can be caused by viral or bacterial infection. Ocular signs of canine distemper virus, a fatal disease in ferrets, are mucopurulent oculonasal discharge, blepharitis, corneal ulcers, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca. 33 Conjunctival swelling and a proliferative lesion of the nictitans caused by infection with Mycobacterium genavense have been described in two ferrets. Other clinical signs in these ferrets included peripheral lymph node enlargement. 37 Degeneration of corneal endothelial cells leading to progressive corneal edema and cloudiness of the cornea is seen in older mink (8-11 years of age). 26 Royal pastel females are predisposed. Unlike the disease in dogs, these mink do not develop corneal ulceration, pigmentation, or vascularization. There is no specific treatment for this condition, but symptomatic treatment with 5% sodium chloride solution or ointment two to four times a day may or may not improve corneal clarity.",

Severity ranged from clinically insignificant, small cataracts in the posterior cortex of the lens to blinding, complete cataracts. By 18 months of age, cataracts were detected in virtually every animal, and in animals previously diagnosed, the cataracts had progressed. A genetically separate group had a combination of blinding cataract, microphthalmos, abnormal iris formation, and retinal detachment. In another ferret colony, microphthalmos, cataract, retinal dysplasia, and a persistent hyperplastic primary vitreoustype membrane were shown to be inherited as an autosomal A B dominant defect. 17 Dietary factors may play a role in the development of cataracts in ferrets. A diet high in fat or deficient in vitamin E or protein may promote cataract formation. 43 In ferrets with cataracts, monitor the eyes regularly for the onset of secondary complications. Lens-induced uveitis can usually be controlled with topical 1% prednisolone acetate applied once or twice daily. Other complications caused by cataracts are lens subluxation or luxation and glaucoma. Ferrets that are blind because of cataracts usually adjust well in a home environment. However, cataract surgery can be performed successfully in ferrets. The lenses can be removed by phacofragmentation or by an extracapsular technique. Artificial lenses are not available in a size suitable for ferrets. Before cataract surgery, make sure the ferret becomes accustomed to frequent application of eye medications to facilitate easy treatment after surgery.",

Exophthalmos is often the presenting complaint. Ophthalmic examination reveals unilateral or bilateral exophthalmos, decreased retropulsion of the globe, and protrusion of the third eyelid. Lagophthalmos may result in exposure keratitis with corneal ulceration and vascularization. In clinical cases, lymphosarcoma is usually present in other areas of the body. In the two ferrets described, 41 peripheral lymph nodes were affected in one ferret and involvement of the liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys, and adrenals was present in the other. Retrobulbar adenocarcinoma has been reported in one ferret, 40 and we have seen this clinically as a rare cause of unilateral exopthalmos (A. van der Woerdt, K. Quesenberry, personal communication, 2006).",

Cytologic examination of a sample from the retrobulbar area obtained by ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration can confirm the diagnosis of neoplasia. However, this procedure can be difficult because of the limited size of the retrobulbar space. Instead, in cases of suspected orbital lymphosarcoma, diagnosis may be confirmed by obtaining samples for diagnostic tests elsewhere in the body, such as a fine-needle aspirate or wedge biopsy of an enlarged lymph node. In ferrets with lymphosarcoma, therapy is directed at treating the disease systemically with prednisone or chemotherapeutic agents. While treating the ferret for lymphosarcoma, temporary tarsorrhaphy may be necessary to protect the cornea if pronounced exophthalmos is present. If the corneal epithelium is intact, protect the eye of a ferret with exophthalmos with lubricating ophthalmic ointment applied two to four times daily. If an ulcer is present, treat with an antibiotic ophthalmic ointment, such as triple antibiotic or gentamicin ointment, applied three to four times daily. In cases of retrobulbar adenocarcinoma, treatment may include exenteration and radiation therapy. 40 Zygomatic salivary gland mucocele is another reported cause of exophthalmos in ferrets. 44 Fine-needle aspiration of a soft fluctuant swelling dorsotemporal to the eye yields a tenacious, blood-tinged fluid. Surgical excision is usually curative (see Chapters 3 and 11).",

Sialodacryoadenitis virus is a highly contagious coronavirus that replicates in the respiratory tract epithelium, causing rhinotracheitis, bronchitis, and alveolitis. The virus also causes sialoadenitis of the submandibular and parotid salivary glands and necrotizing dacryoadenitis of orbital and harderian lacrimal glands. Exophthalmos, epiphora, and keratoconjunctivitis may result. The infection usually resolves within 1 week in immunocompetent animals. In a study of athymic rats, infection persisted for more than 3 months, indicating that normal T-cell function is required for host defenses against the virus. 72 Infection with sialodacryoadenitis virus may also result in uveitis and multifocal retinal degeneration. 33 Complications from infection include corneal opacification, anterior and posterior synechiae, cataract, and glaucoma. Specific therapy is not available, and treatment is supportive only. Other causes for red tears include infection with parainfluenza virus type 3 or Sendai virus as well as pain or stress. Ammonia vapor from soiled bedding can act as an ocular irritant, predisposing animals to secondary infection. Keeping the housing areas well ventilated is important in preventing infection with sialodacryoadenitis virus.",

Transcorneal water loss and altered aqueous humor composition caused by corneal exposure have been suggested as a pathogenesis of cataract formation. 12 In hamsters, keratoconjunctivitis can result from ammonia vapor from soiled bedding. Dental problems including tooth root infection may result in facial or retrobulbar abscesses, with hemifacial swelling, proptosis, and exposure keratitis as common sequelae. Treatment with systemic antibiotics is often unrewarding, and such abscesses frequently lead to the animal's death. 33 Insidious globe enlargement with loss of vision has been reported in four hamsters. 19 Ophthalmic examination of these hamsters revealed enlarged globes in both eyes, widely dilated pupils, lack of pupillary light reflex, a small optic nerve, and pale retinas. Histopathologic results suggested chronic openangle glaucoma. Treatment of the suspected glaucoma was not attempted.",
