All participation takes place electronically, including recruitment, consent, and data collection. Within 48 hours of participants self-reporting respiratory symptoms, a nasal swab kit is delivered to the household via a courier service. Demographic and illness characteristics are collected at the time of sample collection and recovery and behavioral information collected one week later. Specimens are tested in the laboratory for multiple respiratory pathogens, and results are available on a public website for participants.",

In the United States, influenza is estimated to cause 9-45 million illnesses 140,000-810,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000-67,000 deaths while respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is estimated to cause 2 million outpatient visits each year in children under the age of 5 [5, 6] . Despite this burden, estimates about prevalence of the pathogens that result in ARIs rely on in-person healthcare visits or on aggregate counts from hospitalized individuals [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Additionally, these estimates generally capture illnesses when specific symptoms are present, such as fever, cough, or sore throat. Thus, they are likely a poor proxy for the prevalence of illness in community-dwelling individuals who may not necessarily seek care for their illness or have symptoms that fall outside of these criteria.",

Previous studies focused on respiratory pathogen surveillance only studied specific subsets of the population, such as households with children, or required a significant, coordinated effort to capture the community, which makes the approach difficult to replicate [11] [12] [13] . Additionally, similar to traditional respiratory surveillance networks, these studies relied on in-person clinic visits which may contribute to potential spread of these pathogens. Nevertheless, community-wide surveillance studies provide an opportunity to better understand these pathogens among symptomatic individuals with wide-ranging illness severities and variable healthcare-seeking behaviors.",
