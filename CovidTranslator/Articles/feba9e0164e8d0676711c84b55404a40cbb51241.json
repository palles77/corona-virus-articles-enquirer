Here we describe the efficient incorporation of CHIKV envelope glycoproteins into lentiviral and rhabdoviral particles. Vectors pseudotyped with CHIKV envelope proteins efficiently transduced many cell types from different species. However, hematopoietic cell types were either partially or completely refractory. A mutation in E1 (A226V) has been linked with expansion of tropism for mosquito species, although differences in in vitro infection of mosquito cell lines have not been noted. However, pseudovirion infectivity assays detected subtle differences in infection of mosquito cells, suggesting an explanation for the changes in mosquito tropism. The presence of C-type lectins increased CHIKV pseudotyped vector infectivity, but not infection of refractory cells, suggesting that they act as attachment factors rather than primary receptors. CHIKV pseudotypes will serve as an important tool for the study of neutralizing antibodies and the analysis of envelope glycoprotein functions.",

            "text": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus belonging to the Togaviridae family and was first isolated in 1952 from a febrile individual in Tanzania (Peters C, 1990; Strauss, 1986) . CHIKV is transmitted to humans by several species of mosquitoes, with Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus being the two main vectors. Acute infection is characterized by a painful polyarthralgia, high fever, asthenia, headache, vomiting, rash and myalgia (Bodenmann and Genton, 2006; Peters C, 1990; Pialoux et al., 2007) . In many patients, a chronic and incapacitating arthralgia persists for months. During the last 50 years, there have been numerous CHIKV outbreaks in East and Southern Africa and in Southeast Asia (Schuffenecker et al., 2006) . Though generally not fatal, CHIKV has sickened 1.6 million people in the Indian Ocean region since 2005 (Charrel, de Lamballerie, and Raoult, 2007) . Three distinct phylogroups have been described based on E1 sequence of different CHIKV isolates, and microevolution of virus strains has been associated with infection outbreaks (Schuffenecker et al., 2006) . In particular, changes in the envelope glycoproteins (gps) of the virus have been described that affect infectivity in different mosquito species. A single change at position 226 of E1 protein has been associated with the adaptation of the virus to more efficiently infect and be transmitted by Ae. albopictus, which is thought to be the major vector of the large scale CHIKV epidemic on La Reunion Island (Tsetsarkin et al., 2007; Vazeille et al., 2007) , as well as a recent outbreak in Italy (Bonilauri et al., 2008) . This change has also been shown to modulate cholesterol requirement for infection of insect cells by CHIKV (Tsetsarkin et al., 2007) , as well as other alphaviruses (Ahn et al., 1999; Lu, Cassese, and Kielian, 1999) . Whether there is a correlation between cholesterol requirements and CHIKV fitness increase in Ae. albopictus remains unknown. The adaptation of the virus to the broadly distributed mosquito species Ae. albopictus increases the potential of CHIKV to extend its range further into Europe and America (Tsetsarkin et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "Alphaviruses are small enveloped, single stranded, positive polarity RNA viruses (Peters C, 1990) . They attach to poorly characterized receptors on many different cell types in various species. Viral entry generally occurs through receptor-mediated endocytosis, and fusion is dependent on endosomal acidification (DeTulleo and Kirchhausen, 1998; Kolokoltsov, Fleming, and Davey, 2006; Marsh and Helenius, 2006; Marsh, Kielian, and Helenius, 1984) . CHIKV particles contain three structural proteins: glycosylated El and E2 envelope proteins, embedded in the viral membrane, and a non-glycosylated nucleocapsid protein. Based on similarity to other alphaviruses, E2 mediates receptor attachment, while E1 is a class II viral fusion protein. A third glycoprotein, E3, is not associated with mature virions but released into culture fluids (Simizu et al., 1984) , while 6K protein, a membrane-associated peptide created by cleavage of the polyprotein to release E2 and E1, is incorporated into particles at a low level (Gaedigk-Nitschko and Schlesinger, 1990; Lusa, Garoff, and Liljestrom, 1991) . There is a critical lack of knowledge of CHIKV biology, contrasting with related model alphaviruses like Sindbis virus (SINV), Semliki Forest virus (SFV), and Ross River virus (RRV). In particular, little is known about the interaction of CHIKV (and of most alphaviruses) with human primary cells. CHIK virus isolates from La Reunion outbreak have been described to infect in vitro primary fibroblasts, and, to a lower extent monocyte-derived macrophages, but not primary periferal blood mononuclear cells, primary lymphocytes and monocytes, nor monocytederived dendritic cells . Studies using live CHIKV have been limited partially because they must be performed at biosafety level 3 (Anon., 2007) .",

They can also be used to analyze immune responses and the development of neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, They can have utility as vaccines, as well as vectors for gene transfer and gene therapy. In particular, due to CHIKV's apparent preference for muscle satellite cells , CHIKV may be useful for therapeutic gene replacement of muscle disease such as muscular dystrophy. Pseudotyped viruses incorporate heterologous viral gps thus acquiring the host range of the virus from which these gps are derived. Early steps in infection, such as receptor binding, membrane fusion, and entry, are determined solely by properties of the nonrelated envelope protein. Also virus envelope gps are the primary targets of neutralizing antibody responses. The epitopes recognized differ sufficiently between virus subtypes and species to distinguish viruses and provide an important basis for disease diagnosis.",

They will also improve laboratory safety and security as they can be handled at biosafety level 2.",

            "text": "In order to determine if Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) envelope gps were incorporated into HIV pseudoparticles, 293T cells were transfected with pNL-luc, a lentiviral vector encoding luciferase, and a plasmid encoding the CHIKV envelope proteins with and without a point mutation in E1 (A226V) involved in mosquito tropism changes (Tsetsarkin et al., 2007) . As controls, 293T cells were also transfected with plasmids encoding vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein and the pNL-luc vector. After 40 h, the virions obtained were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and the transfected cells were lysed. Both the concentrated virions and the cell lysates were analyzed by western-blot using a mix of 3 different sera from CHIKV infected individuals. CHIKV proteins E1 (52 kDa) and E2 (56 kDa) (that nearly co-migrate in the gel) as well as the p62 (62kDa) precursor protein were detected in both wild type and A226V mutant cell lysates but not in the control VSV-G cell lysate (Fig. 1) . Two nonspecific bands of approximately 80 and 50 kDa respectively were also observed in all the cell lysates samples (Fig. 1) . Similar amounts of CHIKV envelope gps were also detected in the concentrated wild type and mutant CHIKV pseudoparticles indicating that lentiviral particle production was roughly equivalent in both transfections (Fig. 1A) . Thus, CHIKV gps are efficiently produced in 293T cells and are successfully incorporated into the HIV pseudoparticles. Also, the result demonstrates that the CHIKV proteins incorporated into the pseudoparticles are efficiently recognized by antibodies present in the sera of individuals with a prior history of CHIKV infection. Additionally, immunofluorescence studies using anti-CHIKV positive sera on live cells suggested the CHIKV gps were efficiently expressed on the surface of transfected cells (data not shown). Incorporation into murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based retroviral particles was also demonstrated with titers in RD muscle cell line of 9.8 \u00d710 6 FFU/ml for CHIKV envelope and 1.3 \u00d710 7 FFU/ml for VSV-G.",

To further characterize the specificity of CHIKV pseudotype infection, we tested the ability of sera from individuals previously infected with CHIKV to neutralize wild type and A226V E1 mutant pseudovirion infectivity in RD cells. Similar titers of wild type and mutant CHIKV pseudovirions (15 pg/ml) were incubated with either serum from 9 different infected individuals or a control serum from an uninfected individual at various dilutions and then used to infect RD cells. All sera from CHIKV infected patients were able to inhibit RD cell infection by either wild type or mutant envelope pseudotypes with similar efficiency (Table  1 and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Inhibition was dose dependent whereas a negative control serum had little effect, although partial neutralization was seen at the highest concentration (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Similar data was obtained with four additional, geographically diverse, negative control sera (data not shown). No neutralization was seen with CHIKV patient serum using control pseudotypes carrying VSV-G (data not shown). These results demonstrate that entry of the pseudotyped viruses is mediated by the CHIKV gps and validates their utility to evaluate CHIKV antibody neutralization capacity.",

We chose RD cells as targets for infection because they are susceptible to infection by both VSV-G lentiviral pseudotypes that exhibit pH-dependent entry and amphotropic MLV (MLV-A) envelope lentiviral pseudotypes, whose entry is pH-independent (McClure et al., 1990) . Bafilomicin A, an inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPases responsible for acidifying endosomes, inhibited transduction of RD cells by both CHIKV and VSV-G pseudotypes (Fig. 2) . In contrast, no inhibition was detected in MLV-A pseudotype challenged cells, even with high bafilomicin A concentrations (Fig. 2) indicating that the inhibitory effects of bafilomicin A did not result from post entry inhibition of HIV core replication. Similar results were obtained with the acidotropic weak bases ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) and chloroquine (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that CHIKV envelope mediated entry is dependent on endosomal acidification.",

Parallel infections were carried out with HIV particles produced in the absence of a viral envelope protein as a negative control and VSV-G pseudotyped particles, which display a very broad tropism, to distinguish from possible post-entry blockage effects. In this case the HIV vector used was pNL-gfp that carries the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene as a reporter. Virus input of ultracentrifuge pelleted samples was normalized by p24 content prior to infection. The viral titers obtained on the individual cell lines varied quite dramatically (Table 2 ), but in general this variation was consistent between CHIKV envelope and VSV-G pseudovirions (Fig. 3) . GFP expression showed that most cell types listed in Table  2 were permissive for CHIKV pseudotypes demonstrating the wide cellular tropism conferred by CHIKV envelope gps (Fig. 3) . However most hematopoietic cell lines were either completely or partially refractory to CHIKV pseudotype infection. Primary, PHA/IL-2 stimulated PBLs were also not infectible by CHIKV pseudovirions. For reasons of better detection, vectors encoding murine CD24 were used in the place of GFP. PBLs were over 99% CD3 positive, and could be easily transduced with pseudovirions bearing VSV-G, resulting in 10.3% of cells staining positive for murine CD24. In contrast, even using 10-fold higher inoculum, CHIKV failed to give any significant transduction above that for no envelope controls (0.25 and 0.15% respectively).",

However, no difference in infectivity was found between adherent and suspension cultured 293FR cells (data not shown) indicating that the susceptibility to CHIKV pseudotype infection is most likely independent of cell adhesion. The titers of the VSV-G pseudotypes were consistently higher than that of the CHIKV envelope except in the case of human NP2 glioma cell line and chicken embryo fibroblasts in which CHIKV envelope pseudotypes titers were respectively 26% and 35% higher than those of VSV-G pseudotypes (Fig. 3 ). This is consistent with a strong tropism for fibroblasts and the CNS observed in in vivo models of CHIKV infection (Couderc et al., 2008) . Endothelial human primary cells and human primary keratinocytes were also susceptible to CHIKV pseudotype infection (Fig. 3) . In a separate experiment, fetal primary CD146+ myoblasts were also highly susceptible to CHIKV pseudotypes, with a titer of 4.3 \u00d7 107 FFU/ml. CD146 is a marker for myoblasts (Cerletti et al., 2006) , and thus these results are consistent with previous findings that CHIKV infects muscle precursor cells . It has been described that monocytes are insensitive to CHIKV infection while human primary macrophages are productively infected . Differentiation of THP1 monocytes into macrophages using retinoic acid (Hickstein et al., 1992) resulted in a 4-fold increase in CHIKV pseudotype susceptibility (data not shown) suggesting that CHIKV inability to infect monocytes may be at least partially related to a lack of efficient entry that is overcome by the changes induced after the macrophage differentiation process. HIV does not replicate efficiently in primary monocytes, thus we developed VSV-based pseudovirions (Matsuura et al., 2001) in order to study CHIKV envelope-mediated monocyte infection. experiments have been performed with fresh isolated PBMC, containing primary lymphocytes and monocytes. While good infection was observed in CD14 positive cells (monocytes) using VSV-G envelope as a control with 8.8% of GFP positive cells, little significant infection (1% of GFP positive cells) was seen with the same backbone and CHIKV envelope.",

Whether this change has any effect in the ability of the virus to infect the mammalian host has not previously been addressed. We therefore compared the infectivity of both wild type and E1 A226V mutant pseudoparticles in different mammalian cell lines.

Again, parallel infections were carried out with VSV particles produced in the absence of a viral envelope protein as a negative control and VSV-G pseudotyped particles to distinguish from possible post-entry blockage effects. Using particles first normalized by titering on RD cells, the infectivity of VSV pseudotypes bearing the CHIKV envelope 226V mutation was higher by more than 4 fold in C6/36 and 2 fold in C7-10 Ae. albopictus cell lines when compared to wild type envelope pseudotypes (Fig. 5A ). These subtle differences were statistically significant (P<0.05) in multiple independent experiments using different batches of pseudovirions, and demonstrate a role for this E1 mutation in virus binding/entry giving CHIKV 226V a selective advantage in Ae. albopictus cells.

To determine the role of lectin expression on the infectivity of CHIKV pseudotypes, we utilized a previously reported 293T-REx cell line system, in which lectin expression was under the control of a tet repressor protein that allows induction of expression with doxycycline (Pohlmann et al., 2001) . The induction of lectin expression was verified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter staining ( Supplementary  Fig. 2) and Western blot (data not shown). We challenged the lectin expressing 293T-REx cells with luciferase reporter pseudotypes bearing CHIKV envelope glycoproteins. Ebola Zaire (EboZ-GP) envelope and VSV-G pseudotypes, whose infectivity is respectively enhanced and unaffected by the presence of lectins (Simmons et al., 2003) were used as positive and negative controls. Infectivity of EboZ-GP envelope pseudotypes was enhanced over 35-fold in DC-SIGN-expressing 293T-REx cells and 26-fold in DC-SIGNR expressing cells, compared with the parental 293T-REx cells (Fig. 6) . Similarly, the infectivity of CHIKV envelope pseudotypes was enhanced over 10-fold in DC-SIGN-expressed 293T-REx cells and 19-fold in DC-SIGNR expressed cells (Fig. 6) . In contrast, VSV-G infection of either DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR expressing cells was within 2-fold of parental 293T-REx cell infection. Enhancement of CHIKV pseudotypes infectivity was also observed in susceptible HeLa and RD cell lines expressing DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (data not shown). While expression of DC-SIGN on already susceptible cell lines enhanced infection, refractory lines, such as B THP-1, NC-37 and Ramos cell lines, remained resistant to infection, despite stable DC-SIGN expression (data not shown).",

            "text": "We have successfully exploited the cell surface expression of CHIKV proteins in transfected cells to produce lentiviral particles that are able to transduce cells in a CHIKV envelopemediated manner. The infectivity of these pseudotyped reporter viruses in CD4 and CXCR4 negative cell lines (Table 2 ) with a single round of infection, indicates that the CHIKV envelope is directing entry, thus broadening the cell tropism of the resulting HIV particles. CHIKV gps are not only efficiently produced and expressed on the cell surface but are also incorporated in the pseudotyped viruses. Although E1 and E2 proteins migrate closely on gels and could not be distinguished by size due to heterogeneous glycosylation, the fact that correct E2 processing requires E1 coexpression makes it likely that both proteins are being expressed. Furthermore, CHIKV pseudovirions present native epitopes on their surfaces that are recognized by neutralizing human sera from individuals previously infected with CHIKV. CHIKV pseudotypes enter cells through a pH dependent pathway, being readily blocked by three inhibitors of endocytic acidification as described for CHIKV . Thus, CHIKV lentiviral pseudotypes offer the potential to rapidly and easily study native entry pathways of the parental CHIKV in the absence of other cytotoxic effects associated with alphavirus infection. The host range conferred by CHIKV envelope is very broad, enabling the infection by CHIKV pseudotypes of a variety of cell lines from diverse species and tissues. The infection of many of the cell types used for this work is not unexpected as CHIKV displays a rather wide tropism and has been shown to infect a variety of human and non-human cell types (Glasgow, 1966; Hahon and Zimmerman, 1970; Ozden et al., 2007; Rinaldo, Overall, and Glasgow, 1975; Simizu et al., 1984; Sourisseau et al., 2007) . Interestingly, human cell lines A549 and U937, recently described as resistant to CHIKV infection are susceptible to infection by CHIKV lentiviral pseudotypes. These results, together with the fact A549 cells are able to bind CHIKV virions , indicate that the restriction to CHIKV replication in these cells occurs at a post-entry step of viral infection. The exception for CHIKV pseudotypes susceptibility was hematopoietic cell lines, most of which were partially or completely refractory to the infection (Table 2 and Fig. 3 ). Similar results have been described for replication competent CHIKV, as well as pseudovirions bearing envelopes from the related alphaviruses RRV and SFV (La Linn et al., 2005; Strang et al., 2005) . We believe that the failure to transduce those cells is most likely due to the lack or limited expression of the cellular receptor(s), or cellular events involved in internalization, given the efficiency of transduction by VSV-G pseudotypes. These results suggest that CHIKV receptor(s) are present in different host species and thus CHIKV envelope provides a broad specificity to the pseudotyped vectors. Susceptibility of some cell types to Ebola virus has been described to be affected by cell adhesion properties (Dube et al., 2008) . Our results show that the differences in CHIKV pseudotypes infectivity between adherent and non-adherent cells are independent of the anchorage-dependency of the cells. The refractory hematopoietic-cell types may be useful for receptor identification. The fact that partially refractory THP1 monocytes increase their susceptibility upon differentiation to macrophages, most likely by induced expression of the virus receptor, makes cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage potential candidates in aiding the discovery of the CHIKV cell surface receptor(s).",

            "text": "The use of CHIKV pseudotypes also provides a straightforward tool for the functional characterization of envelope gps variants. Single amino acid changes in CHIKV gps such as E1 A226V have been described to affect virus specificity (Tsetsarkin et al., 2007; Vazeille et al., 2007) . Moreover, adaptation of CHIKV 226V to Ae. albopictus mosquitoes coincides with CHIKV dependence on cholesterol in the target cell membrane (Tsetsarkin et al., 2007) . Similarly, a mutation in the same position of the E1 gp from SFV has been described to affect the cholesterol dependency of the virus (Vashishtha et al., 1998) and, unlike CHIKV (Tsetsarkin et al., 2007) , results in the more efficient growth of SFV in Ae. albopictus mosquitoes (Ahn et al., 1999) . Whether there is direct correlation between the release from the cholesterol dependence, and the growth advantage in Ae. Albopictus remains unknown. As expected, we have found no effect of E1 A226V mutation in CHIKV pseudotypes infectivity in mammalian cells. However, the presence of the mutation increases CHIKV pseudotypes infectivity in Ae. albopictus cells from 2 to 4 fold but has no effect in Ae. aegypti cells. These results demonstrate a direct effect of the mutation in the CHIKV entry process resulting in differences in cellular tropism. Although both are derived from Singh's original larva isolates (Singh and Pavri, 1967) , several reports suggest differences between C6/36 and C7-10 Ae. albopictus subclones indicating that they may represent different tissue types in the adult insect (Condreay and Brown, 1986; Condreay and Brown, 1988; Miller and Brown, 1992; Miller and Brown, 1993) . Thus, it may be that the 226V change confers a selective advantage in multiple cell types within Ae. Albopictus. Despite the demonstrated fitness advantage of E1 226V virus in Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, almost indistinguishable growth kinetics of CHIKV 226A and 226V viruses in Ae. albopictus C6/36 cells have been described (Tsetsarkin et al., 2007) . While this appears to be somewhat contradictory to our results that show that the E1 226V CHIKV pseudotype entry in Ae albopictus cells C6/36 and C7-10 is subtly more efficient than the wild type, multiple rounds of replication and post-entry steps of the virus life cycle likely conceal this difference and result in almost equivalent growth kinetics. A putative role for E1 226 position in membrane fusion is consistent with its predicted location in the ij loop, a region believed to interact with the target membrane, in contact with the fusion peptide (Schuffenecker et al., 2006) . However, we cannot rule out additional implications of the E1 A226V mutation in other steps of the virus life cycle like virus budding and exit. Whether this more efficient entry of the virus is enough to account for the fitness advantage of the E1 226V mutant in Ae. albopictus mosquitoes and its possible association with cholesterol dependence requires further investigation. CHIKV pseudotypes will facilitate the study of the effect of cholesterol in virus entry independently of the post-entry steps.",

DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR lectins bind virus envelope proteins in a carbohydratedependent manner, and are likely recognizing high mannose moieties on the viral gps, which contain at least four predicted N-linked glycosylations (asn-X-ser/thr, where X can be any aa apart from proline; (Hubbard and Ivatt, 1981) ). In mouse models of CHIKV infection the liver represents a strong initial target for viral replication, followed by detection of virus in muscle and skin (Couderc et al., 2008) . Consistent with this, CHIKV pseudotypes efficiently infect (1.9 \u00d7 10 5 FIU/ml) Huh7 human hepatic cell line. The expression of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, as well as other C-type lectins, in the liver (Lai et al., 2006; Pohlmann et al., 2001 ) may thus be involved in the early targeting of this organ, while C-type lectins on macrophages and dendritic cells may be involved in disseminating the virus to other tissues.",

Human primary blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were isolated as previously described (Simmons et al., 1995) and stimulated in RPMI 1640 containing 20% FCS and 0.5 \u00b5g/ml phytohaemagglutinin (PHA, Roche). After 3 days culture, the cells were spun and resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 20% FCS and 20 units/ml human interleukin-2 (IL-2, Roche). Human primary monocytes were isolated from donors by apheresis and elutriation. Human primary monocyte-derived macrophages were isolated as previously described (Simmons et al., 1995) and cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% human serum and penicillin/streptomycin (15 units/ml). The C7-10 Ae. albopictus cell line was kindly provided by Victor Stollar (UMDNJ), while C6/36 were obtained from the ATCC. C7-10 and C6/36 were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (15 units/ml) while Ae aegypti cells (ATCC CCL-125) were cultured in MEM supplemented with 20% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (15 units/ml). Fetal muscle cells were obtained from elective abortions with the approval of the Committee for Human Research at the University of California, San Francisco and consent of the women undergoing the procedure. The gestational age of the tissues was estimated based on the foot-length of the fetus and ranged from 19 to 24 weeks. Fetal tissues were harvested shortly after termination of the pregnancy and transported to the laboratory on ice in Hank's balanced salt solution with calcium and magnesium (HBSS) and supplemented with 100 \u00b5g/ml gentamicin and 2.5 \u00b5g/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Muscle cells were isolated from tongue or thigh muscles and grown similarly to a previously described method (Ozeki et al., 2006) . Briefly, the tissue was washed with HBSS solution and, in the case of thigh muscles, the skin removed and the muscle tissue separated from the bone. The tissues were minced using scissors into pieces \u2264 0.5 cm 3 . These fragments were digested using a combination of 1% collagenase class D, 2.4 U/ml grade II Dispase and 0.005% DNase (Roche Diagnostic Corporation, Indianapolis, IN) in 20 ml of HBSS for 30-45 min. at 37 \u00b0C with gentle agitation. The cell suspension was then passed through a fine wire mesh and any remaining larger fragments disrupted using a glass pestle. The resulting cell suspension was then passed through a 70 m cell strainer (BD Biosciences) to remove any remaining tissue fragments. Cells were washed twice by centrifugation. Muscle cells were cultured on Laminin-1 coated dishes (BD Falcon) in F-10 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 \u00b5g/ml recombinant human insulin (Roche Diagnostic Corporation), 50 \u00b5g/ml gentamicin and 2.5 \u00b5g/ml amphotericin B.

After 3 washes, 10 min. each, with TBS-0.05% Tween-20 the membrane was incubated with 1:200 dilution of Alexa 488 goat anti-human antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed with TBS-0.05% Tween-20 three times for 10 min. each, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 imaging system in blue fluorescence mode.",
