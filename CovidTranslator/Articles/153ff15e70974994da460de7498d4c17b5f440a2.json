            "text": "Introduction Surveillance systems for acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children currently are often limited in terms of the panel of pathogens and the age range investigated or are only syndromic and at times only active in the winter season. Methods Within PID-ARI.net, a research network for ARI in children in Germany, an active, year-round surveillance system was formed in three regions from north to south for population-based analysis. Children from birth to 16 years of age were included and up to 19 noncolonizing airway pathogens were tested for with multiplex RT-PCR. Results In the 10-year period from July 1996 to June 2006, a total of 18,899 samples were tested. The positive rate increased with the size of the test panel to up to 72.9%. Picornaviruses (35-39%), paramyxoviruses (23-28%) and orthomyxoviruses (5.8-12.5%) comprised the highest fraction. Reoviruses and Legionella pneumophila were not found at all and Chlamydia pneumoniae and Bordetella parapertussis only rarely. Respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3 were anticyclical in rhythmicity with metapneumovirus and PIV1 and PIV2. The age medians per pathogen depended predominantly upon the attack rate and interepidemic intervals. Conclusion Active surveillance systems for ARI are superior to passive systems. They should be pathogen-specific and comprehensive for viruses and bacteria and age ranges. They should be population-based and multilevel to avoid bias. The impact of atypical bacteria in children was highly overestimated in earlier studies.",

By covering the children of 2% of the total population living in Germany and the three areas, the system is of the sentinel type. The size of the system was limited by the financial resources available. This had an effect on the detection of pathogens that cause more local outbreaks, such as Mpn, Cpn and Lpn, that therefore could be missed by the system; however, the 10-year period should have provided the system with sufficient power to detect these pathogens if they occurred in sufficient numbers across a considerable geographic spread. For pathogens with widespread activity, such as most viruses in their main seasons, the limited geographical size should have had no influence. Given the limited resources, the system focused on the tip of the ARI iceberg, i.e. hospitalized children. Hospitalization is an acceptable surrogate for severe ARI. Inpatients are a selected subpopulation and are not necessarily representative of children in general for this reason. To broaden the picture, outpatients were included. Ascertainment of NPA in our system was clearly related to age and increased with younger age. This biased the results toward pathogens related to a younger age, as the sample was dominated by younger age as 86.9% of the patients were recruited in hospital. This can be seen by the far right skewing of the age distributions (see medians and means given). Young age is a known risk factor for hospitalization [5] . Therefore the data were stratified by hospitalization status.",

            "text": "Validation of m-RT-PCRs is a major issue and requires a considerable amount of effort, particularly if one has high Table 1 ) standards in terms of sample size and gold-standard testing [25] . Before October 2002, the sensitivity of the m-RT-PCR for PIV3 was poor (Fig. 2a) as the primers published by Karron et al. [15] detected only about 60% of PIV3-positive findings. After changing the primers from the F-gene to the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene, sensitivity reached the desired level [25] . Delineation between EV and RV is difficult since both viruses are closely related, and therefore some misjudgment could have occurred. This, however, should not have compromised the interpretation considerably, since the two viruses are closely related. Data from Finland demonstrated that EV is genetically more closely related to group B RV than group A is to group B RV, and the new name enterorhinovirus was proposed to indicate that the distinction is artificial [17] . Co-infections became an issue only after molecular diagnostic techniques, especially PCR technology, facilitated the co-identification of pathogens [12] . The 12.5% of our data result from the size of the panel investigated, especially regarding viruses commonly found in co-infections, age and recruitment type (i.e., in-versus outpatients). A preponderance of RSV together with MPV as found by the group in Liverpool in severe infections could not be confirmed by our data [28] ; however, the detailed clinical data are still under evaluation. Length of time of persistence of a given pathogen in the host and a less severe clinical course (outpatients) increased the probability of acquiring a second pathogen or a co-infection before referral for medical treatment. So far, the chance of a co-infection appears more stochastical than representative of a specific relationship between two pathogens. Sequential infections of viruses and bacteria are well known [20, 24] , but conventional bacteria were not included in our test panel for the reasons mentioned above.",

Climatic factors or alternating subtypes are an unlikely explanation for alternating early and late seasons. An interesting explanation would be the interference of other viruses such as parainfluenza types 1 and 2 as mentioned by Glezen [4] . Our discovery of MPV as the major competitor of RSV further substantiates this hypothesis. For viruses with a distinct rhythmicity, clinically important predictions can currently be made at least for RSV, e.g., regarding curtailing passive immunization with palivizumab [34] . During the last 7 years, we were able to predict the onset of RSV correctly. That RSV in some years does not go into an epidemiological eclipse was also observed in coastal areas of the United States [7] . Whether sporadic positive samples for epidemic viruses can be found in the population depends on the sample size investigated and the age range of the surveillance system. Most recently, adult chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients have been considered as a reservoir for RSV [37] . In addition, premature infants excrete the virus over many months.",

This could explain a similar effect on the median age between in-and outpatients as seen for Bp. The difference in the median age for Bpp, however, was not statistically significant due to the small number of 22 patients.",

Ro, which can be estimated as the quotient of life expectancy divided by average age of first infection, was the highest in RSV and PIV3. The lower the attack rate per year and the wider the interepidemic interval, the higher the median age. The \"subtype phenomenon\" described earlier [35] , refers to IVA and IVB, when children become older with a nonprotective immunity because the involved strains have drifted far apart and therefore a potential crossprotection does not occur [1] . This would imply an effect similar to being infected initially with a stable virus at a later age. It is most likely true of all ARI pathogens that first infections are more likely to be severe ARI or LRI than infections later in life when the host has already experienced previous infections with the pathogen and upper ARI become more likely. The fact that the median age of inpatients for Mpn and Cpn was similar to outpatients alludes also to the influence of the attack rate and interepidemic interval and possibly to the immune-enhancement conferred by earlier infections, a welldescribed phenomenon in Mpn infections [2] .",

Therefore no clear rhythm can be noted yet. The impact of IVA was higher than IVB in all seasons except the most recent one. The attributable fraction of influenza viruses varied from 0.8% in the weak season 2005/ 2006 to 10.4% in the most severe season 2002/2003. IVA occurred annually with a clear epidemiological eclipse in the summer months. The IVA seasons started between calendar weeks 47 and 5. IVB does not occur in epidemic proportions every year. One-to two-year gaps such as in ey 2003/2004, and 1999/2000-2000/2001 were observed. In 2001/2002 and 2002/2003, IVB occurred in 2 consecutive years.",
