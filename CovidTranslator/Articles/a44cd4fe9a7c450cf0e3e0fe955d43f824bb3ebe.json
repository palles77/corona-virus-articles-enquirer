In order to examine the biological effect of constitutive CCL2 expression in the CNS, the authors engineered a mouse that expressed CCL2 in the CNS under control of the human glial fibrillary acidic protein (hGFAP) promoter. The results demonstrated that transgenic expression of CCL2 in the CNS resulted in diffuse CNS monocyte infiltration and accumulation. Transgenic CCL2 expression did not alter normal development, differentiation, or function of T cells. There was no evidence of overt CNS disease or other pathologic phenotype when mice were left unchallenged with antigen or uninfected. However, when CCL2 transgenic mice were given a peripheral challenge of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an inflammatory infiltrate with organized perivascular lesions developed. Infection of the transgenic mice with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) resulted in accelerated onset and increased severity of clinical and histological disease. These results suggest that CCL2 expression in the CNS is a major pathogenic factor that drives macrophage accumulation in the development of CNS inflammatory disease.

            "text": "Intracerebral infection of susceptible inbred strains of mice with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) leads to a chronic, immune-mediated demyelinating disease . Because of the suspected viral etiology, chronic pathology, and primary demyelination accompanied by mononuclear cell infiltration seen in multiple sclerosis (MS), TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) is considered to be an excellent experimental model of MS . Virus is rapidly cleared from the peripheral circulation; however, TMEV persists within the central nervous system (CNS) of susceptible mice for their lifetime (Clatch et al, 1990) , serving as a reservoir for chronic activation of virus-specific T cells (Lipton et al, 1995) . Although TMEV has been shown to preferentially reside in CNS macrophages, the role of TMEV infection in the chronic activation of macrophages to secrete soluble proinflammatory cytokines is unknown. As a result of CNS TMEV infection, increasing virus-specific (DTH-delayed type hypersensitivity) has been shown to correlate with development of increasing disease severity, supporting a role for Th1-mediated CNS inflammation (Clatch et al, 1986) . Virus replication occurs in the spinal cord (Yamada et al, 1990; Ozden et al, 1991) and focal inflammation, consisting primarily of T cells and macrophages, is limited to the spinal cord white matter (Lipton, 1975) . From 2 to 5 months following infection, extensive demyelination occurs, leading to clinical paralysis (Dal Canto and Lipton, 1975) . One of the major characteristics of TMEV-IDD includes CNS mononuclear cell infiltration over the disease course. Immune responses originate in peripheral lymphoid tissue and once activated, the specific lymphocytes leave the organized lymphoid tissue and accumulate in the CNS.",

            "text": "In order to study the regulation of CNS demyelinating diseases by specific chemokines, we constructed a CCL2 transgenic mouse. The hGFAP-CCL2 transgene construct ( Figure 1A ) was used to produce six transgenic founders, of which four transmitted the transgene to offspring. In the present report, we used the JE32 (MCP-1 low ) mouse line for our studies. Expression of the hGFAP promoter is known to target CCL2 production to astrocytes (Huang et al, 2002) . The presence of hGFAP-CCL2 was confirmed by Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of tail DNA samples (data not shown). To demonstrate tissue-specific expression levels of CCL2 mRNA, RNase protection assay (RPA) was performed on CNS tissue recovered from mice at 6 to 9 weeks of age. As shown in Figure 1B , there was a dramatic increase in CCL2 levels in the forebrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord of JE32 transgenic mice compared to minimal expression in wild-type controls. All other tissues were negative (data not shown). Astrocytespecific expression of CCL2 was confirmed by in situ hybridization (data not shown). Additionally, there was an increase in CXCL10 (Crg-2) mRNA expression in the JE32 transgenic mice ( Figure 1B ). Because RPA analysis indicated high levels of CCL2 mRNA expression in the CNS, we wanted to know if the level of chemokine protein was also increased in the periphery. To assess this possibility, serum was recovered from control mice at 32 weeks of age and from JE32 mice at both 9 and 36 weeks of age and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of CCL2. In wild-type mice at 32 weeks of age, very little CCL2 could be detected in the serum ( Figure 1C ). However, there was a significant increase in serum CCL2 levels in JE32 mice at 9 weeks of age ( Figure 1C ). JE32 mice that were 36 weeks of age showed a more pronounced level of CCL2 in the serum when compared to either wild-type control or 9-week-old transgenic mice. These data indicate that the CCL2 transgene was expressed in the CNS, specifically by astrocytes, and resulted in a translated protein product that could be detected in the serum.",

There were increases noted in the size of individual spleen and lymph nodes obtained from JE32 mice, but the average weight of organs and average number of mononuclear leukocytes per milligram of tissue was not remarkably different (data not shown).

Cells isolated from the CNS were further separated by flow cytometric sorting into CD45 low CD11b + and CD45 high CD11b + populations. cDNA prepared from the purified cell populations was analyzed by PCR for expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), a welldocumented marker of activated macrophages (Lyons et al, 1992) . Controls for iNOS expression included purified macrophages treated with 75 \u03bcg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 h. The results in Figure 3B show that both resident microglia (CD45 low CD11b + ) and infiltrating monocyte/macrophage (CD45 high CD11b + ) populations in CCL2-transgenic mice are not activated, similar to transgene negative controls. This result is consistent with the absence of clinical disease in untreated CCL2-transgenic mice. These data demonstrate that transgenic expression of CCL2 in the murine CNS mediates accumulation of mononuclear cells, predominantly monocytes/macrophages, in the absence of inflammatory stimuli, and that these cells have a na\u00efve, unactivated phenotype.",

Spinal cord tissue from TMEV-infected CCL2transgenic mouse strains (JE32 and JE95) demonstrates more severe mononuclear cell infiltration and development of numerous perivascular lesions as well as meningial accumulation (JE32 shown, Figure 6A and B). CNS tissue from control and JE32 mice was also analyzed for degree of demyelination by epon-embedded, toluidine blue-stained thin sections (data not shown). The results of the demyelination studies were consistent with the H&E histology results, showing slightly higher, though not significantly different, demyelination scores at 2 to 3 weeks post TMEV infection compared to controls.

The results indicate that microglia and monocytes in both SJL\u00d7SWR and CCL2-transgenic spinal cord tissue do not express iNOS. The data are representative of at least two experiments. To determine the constituents of the inflammatory infiltrate in both control and JE32 mice, we performed flow cytometric analysis of cells recovered from spinal cords of mice 4 weeks post infection, at a time when there was evidence of clinical disease. Figure 7 shows that the TMEV-infected JE32 mice showed a greater percentage of both lymphocytes (CD45 high CD11b \u2212 ) and monocytes (CD45 high CD11b + ) than the control mice. In both control and JE32 mice, the lymphocyte infiltrate consisted of a mixture of CD4 and CD8 T cells. The CCL2 transgenic mice appeared to have a lower percentage of microglia (CD45 low CD11b + ); however, this was simply due to the increased fraction of lymphocytes and monocytes in the sample.

One possibility is enhanced tissue damage mediated by an increased mononuclear cell infiltrate consisting of T cells and effector macrophages. The second is augmented TMEV replication and viral presence in the CNS, possibly inducing direct cytolytic events in oligodendrocytes. To determine between these two possibilities, we infected both control (SJL\u00d7SWR) and JE32 mice with TMEV, allowed disease to develop, and harvested spinal cord tissue for analysis of the presence of virus by plaque forming assay. The results in Figure 8 demonstrate no significant difference in the viral titers among control and transgenic mice. These data suggests that CNS CCL2 transgenic expression does not enhance or diminish the replication of TMEV. Rather, the data support the idea that CNS CCL2 transgenic expression enhances mononuclear cell infiltration, which leads to enhanced clinical and histologic demyelinating disease.",

However, it could be possible that the presence of any virus in the CNS of CCL2-transgenic mice would be a sufficient stimulus to activate the accumulated macrophage pool, initiating inflammation and development of demyelinating disease. To test this possibility, SJL\u00d7SWR control and CCL2transgenic mice were infected intracranially with mCMV (Smith strain) or TMEV and monitored for disease development. mCMV is a double-stranded DNA \u03b2-herpesvirus that normally replicates in the liver and spleen of susceptible strains of mice dur-ing the replicative phase (approximately 14 days) before entering a latent phase. mCMV can infect astrocytes, neurons, endothelial cells, radial glia, ependymal cells, microglia, and cells from the meninges and choroid in the mouse CNS (Tsutsui et al, 1989; Shinmura et al, 1997; van Den Pol et al, 1999) as well as macrophages (Brautigam et al, 1979) . The results shown in Figure 9 demonstrate that TMEV-infected CCL2-transgenic mice developed an earlier-onset disease compared to mCMV-infected CCL2-transgenic mice and and TMEV-infected wild-type control mice. Following onset of disease in TMEV-infected CCL2transgenic mice and the appearance of clinical symptoms in TMEV-infected SJL\u00d7SWR mice, all groups were analyzed by histology ( Figure 9B ) and flow cytometry ( Figure 9C ) to determine whether infection with mCMV resulted in altered pathology and cellular infiltrate. Spinal cords of mCMV-infected SJL\u00d7SWR mice showed no focal lesions ( Figure 9B , a), whereas TMEV-infected SJL\u00d7SWR showed scattered small perivascular lesions and meningial accumulation ( Figure 9B, b) . Spinal cords of mCMVinfected CCL2-transgenic mice had a diffuse infiltrate with few scattered focal lesions and meningial accumulation ( Figure 9B , c) but did not demonstrate the level of pathology associated with ongoing demyelinating disease, as in TMEV-infected CCL2-transgenic mice ( Figure 9B, d) . Finally, flow cytometric analysis of CNS-infiltrating cells shows that mCMV infection results in far fewer CD4 + T cells and monocytes/ macrophages in SJL\u00d7SWR control mice compared to TMEV-infected controls ( Figure 9C ). This correlates with the absence of demyelinating disease in these animals. Surprisingly, mCMV-infected CCL2transgenic mice showed no clinical disease despite the presence of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and a similar ratio of CD11b + CD45 high cells in the spinal cord tissue compared to TMEV-infected transgenic mice ( Figure 9C ). These data demonstrate that the effect of CCL2 on demyelinating disease initiated by TMEV is not only due to the enhanced accumulation of macrophages, but is also specific to TMEV infection.",

The results demonstrated that CNS transgenic expression of CCL2 induces a monocyte/macrophage accumulation in the CNS (Figure 2 ). This cellular accumulation was benign in that the accumulating cells were not activated and no overt histological or clinical inflammatory disease was induced in the absence of an inciting stimulus (Figures 3 and 4) . However, when the transgenic mice were challenged with LPS, there was evidence of organized CNS mononuclear cell lesions (Figure 4) . Moreover, when the transgenic mice were infected with TMEV, clinical disease onset ( Figure 5 ) was more rapid and histologic disease was more severe (Figure 6 ). CCL2 has been previously overexpressed in the CNS using the myelin basic protein promoter (Fuentes et al, 1995) where the cellular distribution of the gene product was limited to oligodendrocytes rather than astrocytes. Administration of LPS to these mice initiated inflammation, presumably by inducing macrophage accumulation the CNS, similar to what we have observed in the present report. Our results support the idea that CCL2-mediated monocyte/macrophage accumulation in the CNS is a pathogenic factor in the development of CNS inflammatory demyelinating disease.",

The first is that overexpression of CCL2 by astrocytes results in an influx and accumulation of normal monocytes/macrophages into the CNS. These cells are not activated and there is no evidence of inflammatory lesions or spontaneous inflammatory disease or histologic disease. These monocytes/macrophages have the capacity to be activated as a peripheral challenge of the JE32 transgenic mice with LPS-induced organized CNS mononuclear cell lesions. These lesions are presumably due to the activation of monocytes/macrophages previously recruited to the CNS as a result of CCL2 overexpression. During the normal TMEV disease process, CCL2 is expressed in the CNS of infected mice (Hoffman et al, 1999) and anti-CCL2 treatment results in decreased monocyte accumulation in the CNS (manuscript submitted). These findings support the idea that enhanced disease as a result of transgenic overexpression of CCL2 is due to enhanced monocyte accumulation. However, from the histology data, it cannot be ruled out that either LPS challenge or TMEV infection induced the activation of microglia to form inflammatory foci resembling an accumulation of monocytes/macrophages.",

However, our present data ( Figure 2 does not support this idea. In unchallenged, uninfected JE32 transgenic mice, there is little T-cell (CD4 + or CD8 + ) accumulation but there is a significant monocyte/macrophage (CD45 high CD11b + ) accumulation. This low level of T-cell accumulation could be the result of upregulation of CXCL10 (Crg-2, Figure 1B ). CD44 expression is usually associated with memory T-cells, but there is no indication of previous activation by other surface markers. CD44 upregulation on unactivated cells with no CD25 or CD69 expression and unchanged CD62L have been previously reported (Viret et al, 2000) . Further, CD44 expression is thought to play a role in leukocyte migration into tissue, as up-regulation of the molecule has been associated with binding to its ligand, hyaluronan, and rolling or adhesion before extravasation (DeGrendele et al, 1997) . CD44 has been correlated with CNS infiltration by CD4 + T cells (Brocke et al, 1999) , suggesting that up-regulation may be required for entry and retention of the small number of T cells observed in CCL-transgenic mice. These cells do not appear to be activated except for CD44 expression. Significant accumulation of T cells in the CNS occurs only after TMEV infection (Figure 7) . Further support that the murine CCL2 and CCR2 axis primarily controls CNS monocyte/macrophage and has little regulation over T-cell accumulation has been demonstrated in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Fife et al, 2000; Huang et al, 2001) .",

            "text": "It was also possible that transgenic overexpression of CCL2 in the CNS promoted enhanced viral replication by inducing accumulation of the macrophage, which is the reservoir for viral persistence (Clatch et al, 1990) . The presence of more host cells could potentially result in an increased production of infective virus that could lead to direct infection and cytolysis of oligodrendrocytes (Aubert and Brahic, 1995) , culminating in enhanced clinical disease ( Figure 5 ). We do not believe that this was the case as there is no apparent difference in CNS viral titer between control and transgenic mice (Figure 8) . Therefore, the data argue in favor of the hypothesis that expression of CCL2 promotes CNS accumulation of monocytes/macrophages that are not activated. Upon infection with TMEV, transgenic mice develop disease more rapidly than controls due to the presence of the end-stage effector cells in the CNS. Eventually, the control mice reach the same level of clinical disease as the transgenic mice as a result of normal accumulation of monocytes/macrophages in this model. Further, the mCMV studies demonstrate that the accelerated disease observed in CCL2-transgenic mice is specific to TMEV infection and not due to a nonspecific activation of localized monocytes/macrophages by any virus introduced into the CNS. This is consistent with our conclusion that the role of CCL2 in TMEV-induced demyelinating disease is directing macrophage accumulation. Figure 9 mCMV infection of SJL\u00d7SWR and CCL2-transgenic mice. (A) Control SJL\u00d7SWR and CCL2-transgenic mice were infected intracranially with mCMV or TMEV and monitored for development of demyelinating disease symptoms. (B) After 28 days, after disease onset in the CCL2-transgenic TMEV-infected mice, spinal cord tissue was recovered by dissection and analyzed by H&E histology. Spinal cords of SJL\u00d7SWR mice infected with mCMV showed no focal lesions (a), whereas SJL\u00d7SWR infected with TMEV showed scattered small perivascular lesions and meningial accumulation (b). Spinal cords of CCL2-transgenic mice infected with mCMV had diffuse infiltrate with a few scattered focal lesions and meningial accumulation (c). TMEV-infected CCL2-transgenic mice (d) showed multifocal mononuclear cell infiltration and extensive multilayer meningial accumulation associated with ongoing demyelinating disease. (C) Cells were also isolated from spinal cord tissue at day 28 after infection and analyzed for T-cell infiltrate (CD4 + and CD8 + ) and microglia or monocyte/macrophage accumulation (CD45 low CD11b + and CD45 high CD11b + ) by flow cytometry. Data are derived from the forward scatter versus side scatter and CD45 + gates for all cells, as well as the CD11b + gate for migroglia for monocyte/macrophages. The chemokine regulation of demyelinating disease has been studied in other virus-induced models. In a separate study, TMEV-IDD was induced using different strains of virus: DA, GDVII, and H101. These are neurovirulent strains of TMEV that cause different neuropathology and disease when inoculated into SJL/J mice. DA virus causes a chronic demyelinating disease, GDVII virus causes an acute fatal encephalomyelitis, and H101 virus causes an acute pachymeningitis with hydrocephalus. CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL10, and MIP-2 mRNA expression was detected in both the brain and spinal cord during all three infections (Theil et al, 2000) . Murray et al (2000) examined spinal cords during the acute and chronic phases of TMEV infection in mice sus-ceptible (B10.M, H-2f) and resistant (B10, H-2b) to virus-induced demyelination. In this model, TMEV infection resulted in robust expression of mRNAs for CCL2, CCL5, and, CXCL10, but not CXCL1, in brains and spinal cords of both strains of mice within 5 days. During the chronic, demyelinating phase of infection, there was a resurgence in CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10 mRNAs in spinal cords of susceptible B10.M mice. In both of these studies, the direct function of the chemokines identified as being expressed during the disease process was not directly determined, including whether CCL2 regulated monocyte/macrophage accumulation. Lane et al (1998) demonstrated the presence of chemokines in the CNS of mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus. By analyzing chemokine mRNA, they found that CCL4, CCL5, and CXCL10 expression was evident at the time of chronic demyelinating disease. They went on to demonstrate that CCL5 was required for the development of demyelinating disease , whereas CXCL9 and CXCL10 expression was required for control of viral replication (Liu et al, , 2001 . Finally, this same group of investigators demonstrated that CCL2 regulation of monocyte/macrophage accumulation was essential for development of demyelinating disease (Chen et al, 2001) . These examples point to the essential functions of chemokines during the pathogenesis of virus-induced demyelinating disease and support our contention that CCL2 regulates the accumulation of monocytes/macrophages during the development of TMEV-IDD.",

Development of antagonists to CCR2, the only known receptor for CCL2, could lead to regimens that can interdict during ongoing CNS demyelinating disease. Indeed, antagonists to CCR1 can treat ongoing EAE (Liang et al, 2000) by presumably interfering with the ability of CCL3 and/or CCL5 from inducing accumulation of T cells in the CNS (Fife et al, 2001) . This example points to the possibility of interfering with the functions of CCL2 in a similar manner using receptor antagonists to interfere with ongoing disease.",

The modified murine CCL2 gene, with replacement of the mRNA cap site, was obtained from Dr. Barrett Rollins (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) and was placed under the control of the hGFAP promoter to produce the hGFAP-CCL2 transgene. Initial microinjections of (SJL\u00d7SWR)F1 mice resulted in six transgene positive founders identified by Southern blotting of tail DNA for elements of the hGFAP gene. Four founders transmitted the hGFAP-CCL2 transgene to progeny. Normal, nontransgenic (SJL\u00d7SWR)F2 mice were used as controls. SJL\u00d7SWR controls were established by crossing female SJL/J with male SWR mice. The offspring of this cross were then maintained as a repeatedly intercrossed control SJL\u00d7SWR line in parallel with the transgenic lines. The biological properties of JE95 mice were previously described (Huang et al, 2002) . Animal care and use at Northwestern University and the Cleveland Clinic were approved by the respective institutional animal care and use committees and performed according to Public Health Sevice guidelines.",

Cells were pulsed with 1 \u03bcCi 3 H-TdR (ICN Biochemicals, Irvine, CA), incubated an additional 12 h, and harvested onto glass filters (Packard, Meriden, CT). Microscint (Packard, Meriden, CT) fluid was added to the filter and the 3 H-TdR incorporation determined on a Top Count liquid scintillation counter. Counts per minute (CPM) was calculated by subtracting average CPM values of unstimulated wells from average CPM values of anti-CD3-and CD28-stimulated wells.",

Control (SJL\u00d7SWR) and CCL2-transgenic mice were intracereberally infected-with TMEV and assessed for development of histologic disease by examination of 5 \u03bcm hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections cut from tissue embedded in paraffin. CCL2-transgenic mice (JE32, shown) demonstrated severe mononuclear cell infiltration throughout the spinal cord at day 35 post infection, evident as perivascular cuffs, large lesions composed of mononuclear cells, and meningial accumulation of mononuclear cells (A and B). Control (SJL\u00d7SWR) CNS tissue indicated scattered small mononuclear cell lesions and perivascular cuffs (C and D). The data are representative of at least three similar experiments.",
