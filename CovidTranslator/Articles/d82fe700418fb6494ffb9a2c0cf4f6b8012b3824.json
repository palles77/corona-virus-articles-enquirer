ABSTRACT 23 The 3\u00a2-to-5\u00a2 exoribonuclease in coronavirus (CoV) nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) 24 mediates RNA proofreading during genome replication. ExoN catalytic residues are arranged in 25 three motifs: I (DE), II (E), III (D). Alanine substitution of the motif I residues (AA-E-D, four 26 nucleotide substitutions) in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV yields viable mutants 27 with impaired replication and fitness, increased mutation rates, and attenuated virulence in vivo. 28 Despite these impairments, MHV-and SARS-CoV ExoN motif I AA mutants (ExoN-AA) have 29 not reverted at motif I in diverse in vitro and in vivo environments, suggesting that profound 30 fitness barriers prevent motif I reversion. To test this hypothesis, we engineered MHV-ExoN-AA 31 with 1, 2 or 3 nucleotide mutations along genetic pathways to AA-to-DE reversion. We show 32 that engineered intermediate revertants were viable but had no increased replication or 33 competitive fitness compared to MHV-ExoN-AA. In contrast, a low passage (P10) MHV-ExoN-34 AA showed increased replication and competitive fitness without reversion of ExoN-AA. 35 Finally, engineered reversion of ExoN-AA to ExoN-DE in the presence of ExoN-AA passage-36 adaptive mutations resulted in significant fitness loss. These results demonstrate that while 37 reversion is possible, at least one alternative adaptive pathway is more rapidly advantageous than 38 intermediate revertants and may alter the genetic background to render reversion detrimental to 39 fitness. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for lack of ExoN-AA reversion, illuminate 40 potential multi-protein replicase interactions and coevolution, and support future studies aimed at 41 stabilizing attenuated CoV ExoN-AA mutants. 42 43 All rights reserved.

High mutation rates in RNA viruses generate extensive 58 opportunities to overcome evolutionary hurdles, such as antiviral drugs, host immunity, or 59 engineered attenuating changes (1). The evolutionary pathways traversed by RNA viruses are 60 shaped by natural selection, which will favor some evolutionary trajectories more than others 61 based on whether mutations are beneficial, deleterious, or neutral (2). Predicting the likely results 62 of RNA virus evolution is an important step for anticipating viral emergence and for developing 63 escape-resistant antiviral drugs and vaccines (3, 4). 64 65 Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of positive-sense RNA viruses that cause human illnesses 66 ranging from the common cold to severe and lethal respiratory disease (5). All CoVs encode a 67 proofreading exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is critical for 68 replication, fidelity, fitness, and virulence, and ExoN-inactivation has been proposed as a 69 strategy for live-attenuated vaccine development (6-15).

SARS-CoV-ExoN-AA also is stable during acute and 88 persistent animal infections in immunocompetent and immune-compromised mice (12) . The lack 89 of primary reversion is not due simply to reduced adaptive capacity, as both SARS-CoV-and 90 MHV-ExoN-AA can adapt for increased replication (7, 14). Most strikingly, long-term passage 91 of MHV-ExoN-AA (250 passages, P250) yielded a highly fit population that had directly 92 compensated for defective proofreading through evolution of a likely high-fidelity RdRp (7 requires mutations to all four sites ( Figure 1A ).

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/618249 doi: bioRxiv preprint Our results also extend existing studies of CoV ExoN motif I. Motif I AA\u00e0DE mutations in the 249 SARS-CoV nsp14-ExoN dramatically reduce nuclease activity in biochemical assays, but no 250 study has examined the contributions of each residue independently (16, 18) . Intermediate 251 revertants of ExoN-AA did not display consistent or statistical differences in replication, 5-FU 252 sensitivity, or competitive fitness relative to ExoN-AA, suggesting that they remain 253 phenotypically ExoN(-) during infection and supporting previous studies that motif I DE is 254 essential for WT ExoN function. Given these results, we were surprised to observe repeated 255 reversion of the ExoN-AE but not the other two 2nt variants, ExoN-DA and ExoN-ED. One 256 potential explanation is that the specific mutational bias of ExoN-AE makes the revertant 257 mutations more accessible than in ExoN-DA or ExoN-ED. Alternatively, if ExoN-AE has 258 profound replication or fitness defects, selection could drive primary reversion more quickly 259 away from this genotype. Consistent with this hypothesis, ExoN-AE reverted more quickly at a 260 higher MOI, where natural selection acts more efficiently on a larger population size (Table 1) Consistent with this hypothesis, the fitness effects of mutations in nsp12-P250 and nsp14-P250 269 differ based on the motif I genotype; they are beneficial in ExoN-AA but detrimental in the WT-270 All rights reserved.

In previous studies, it has been difficult to determine whether the fitness 271 defects in ExoN(-) CoVs are directly linked to low-fidelity replication or through some other 272 mechanism. Our data suggest that the proofreading function of nsp14-ExoN can be uncoupled 273 from its more general role in replication (Figure 4) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/618249 doi: bioRxiv preprint Cloning and recovery of recombinant viruses.

All variants achieved similar peak titers to ExoN-AA, but detailed examination of 162 their kinetics suggested a potential delay of up to 1.5 hours for all intermediate revertants 163 compared to ExoN-AA. Of note, ExoN-AE was the most delayed, and we detected WT-ExoN-164 DE revertants in two of three replicates, suggesting increased selective pressure against this 165 variant. We next measured the competitive fitness of each intermediate revertant relative to a 166 recombinant ExoN-AA containing seven silent mutations in the nsp2 coding region (ExoN-AA-167 reference). Intermediate revertants were mixed with an equal titer of ExoN-AA-reference at a 168 combined MOI = 0.05 PFU/cell and passaged four times. The ratio of each intermediate revertant 169 to ExoN-AA-reference was quantified at each passage by RT-qPCR, and the change in ratio over 170 time was used to calculate their relative fitness. WT-ExoN-DE was significantly more fit than 171 ExoN-AA, whereas the intermediate revertants (ExoN-AD, -EA, -DA, and -ED) had no 172 increased fitness relative to ExoN-AA (Figure 2B). The apparent increased fitness of ExoN-AE 173 resulted from all lineages reverting to WT-ExoN-DE during the experiment. Finally, our 174 previous studies have shown that adaptation of ExoN-AA includes partial compensation for the 175 replication fidelity defect, as measured by reduced susceptibility to the mutagen 5-fluorouracil 176 (5-FU) (7-11, 24). None of the intermediate variants demonstrated statistically significant 177 differences in 5-FU sensitivity as compared to ExoN-AA (Figure 2C). Thus, with the exception 178 of the ExoN-AE\u00e0DE revertants, no 3nt and 2nt intermediate genotypes along our predicted 179 Intermediate revertants of ExoN-AA motif I do not have selective advantages.

Although we did not find fitness advantages to intermediate revertants, we also did 186 not identify profound fitness costs that would drive their immediate loss from populations. We 187 have previously demonstrated that during 250 passages (P250), ExoN-AA can adapt for 188 increased replication, fitness, and fidelity via secondary mutations outside of motif I (7). We 189 tested whether secondary adaptive mutations could exceed the fitness of ExoN-AA and its 190 intermediate revertants. To examine the early adaptation of ExoN-AA, we studied passage 10 191 from the P250 passage series (Figure 3). ExoN-AA-P10 retains the ExoN-AA motif I genotype 192 but has increased replication and reduced susceptibility to 5-FU, altogether manifesting in 193 greater relative fitness (Figure 3) (7). We identified only six total mutations within ExoN-AA-194 P10 by dideoxy sequencing (Table 2), indicating that rapid adaptation of and compensation for 195 ExoN-AA requires relatively few genetic changes at the consensus level. To test whether 196 interactions between multiple mutations or population level effects contribute to ExoN-AA-P10 197 fitness, we isolated a plaque-purified clone of ExoN-AA-P10. The clone replicated to higher 198 titers than the ExoN-AA-P10 population but had identical 5-FU sensitivity and relative fitness 199 (Figure 3), indicating that genomes derived from a single virus plaque encode the adaptive 200 changes required by the total population. Together, these data demonstrate that mutations outside 201 of ExoN(-) motif I can confer greater fitness advantages than intermediate revertants even at 202 early passages. These early adaptive mutations likely reduce the selective pressure for motif I 203 reversion and place the intermediate revertants at a selective disadvantage. 204 205 All rights reserved.

Mutational fitness effects are highly dependent upon the genetic 209 background (25-27). In addition to reducing selective pressure for reversion, mutations 210 conferring increased fitness to ExoN-AA might also reduce the benefits of motif I reversion. We 211 previously reported that long-term passage of ExoN-AA selects for secondary adaptive 212 mutations in the nsp12 RdRp and nsp14 (nsp12-P250 and nsp14-P250) (7). Nsp12-P250 contains 213 7 nonsynonymous mutations that partially compensate for defective proofreading and increase 214 ExoN-AA fitness. Nsp14-P250 contains 6 nonsynonymous mutations, including a conservative 215 D-to-E substitution in ExoN motif III, and increases ExoN-AA fitness without compensating for 216 defective proofreading. To test whether the fitness effects of passage-associated mutations in 217 nsp12-P250 and nsp14-P250 depend upon the ExoN-AA genotype, we engineered a WT motif I 218 (ExoN-DE) into viruses containing nsp12-P250 and nsp14-P250, alone and together, and 219 analyzed replication, 5-FU sensitivity, and competitive fitness.

Statistical significance of each virus relative to WT-ExoN-DE was determined with two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test (panel B) or by ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test (panels C and D). study, we demonstrate that the stability of the ExoN(-) motif I genotype in MHV (ExoN-237 AA) is a consequence of the limitations and opportunities of the genetic landscape it explores 238 during replication (Figure 5). Our results support a model in which the viable adaptive pathways 239 leading to direct reversion of motif I from AA-to-DE are relatively flat on a fitness landscapes, 240 as intermediate revertants remain phenotypically ExoN(-) and confer no fitness advantage over 241 ExoN-AA. In contrast, at least one alternative adaptive pathway is readily accessible and imparts 242 immediate fitness gains over ExoN-AA. We propose that even minimal alternative pathway 243 adaptive fitness gains reduce the likelihood and benefits of motif I reversion, until eventually the 244 changing genetic background renders reversion detrimental. These data and this model suggest 245 that selection during replication favors immediate, incremental fitness gains along the most 246 accessible pathway rather than dramatic fitness increases across a larger genetic barrier. 247 Model for the in vitro evolution of MHV-ExoN-AA. MHV-ExoN-AA(black dot) is a lowfitness variant. Reversion to WT-ExoN-DE would dramatically increase fitness but can only be achieved by traversing a flat landscape and climbing a steep fitness cliff (dotted white arrows).However, secondary mutations that incrementally increase fitness are more accessible (solid white arrow). Eventually, the genetic background changes enough that reversion becomes detrimental (dotted yellow line).",

Nsp12-P250 also will be an important tool for 275 understanding the relationship between RdRp fidelity and ExoN proofreading during CoV 276 replication and for studying replication complex assembly and interactions. Our studies suggest 277 that compensatory mutations identified through long-term passage could stabilize the ExoN-AA 278 genotype. In particular, the high-fidelity nsp12-P250 could reduce the probability of reversion by 279 reducing mutational sampling within motif I (30), and both nsp12-P250 and nsp14-P250 render 280 the MHV genome inhospitable to a WT-ExoN-DE. Together, these studies argue that 281 experimental evolution can generate reagents to define critical interactions involved in CoV 282 replication and can identify new strategies for stabilizing attenuated CoVs.
