            "text": "Background: Whether or not short-term exposure to particulate matter b2.5 \u03bcm in diameter (PM 2.5 ) increases the risk of psychiatric emergency diseases is unclear. Methods: The study was performed in a metropolis from January 2015 to December 2016. The exposure was PM 2.5 , and the confounders were weather (temperature and humidity) and other pollutants (PM 10 , SO 2 , CO, O 3 , and NO 2 ). The outcomes were emergency department (ED) visits with psychiatric disease codes (F00-F99 in ICD10 codes). General additive models were used for the statistical analysis to calculate the adjusted relative risks (ARRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the daily number of ED visits with a lag of 1 to 3 days following a 10 \u03bcg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 . Results: During the study period, a total of 67,561 ED visits for psychiatric diseases were identified and tested for association with PM 2.5 . Daily ED visits for all psychiatric diseases were not associated with PM 2.5 in the model that was not adjusted for other pollutants. The ARR (95% CI) in the model adjusted for SO 2 was 1.011 (1.002-1.021) by 10 \u03bcg/m 3 of PM 2.5 on Lag 1 for all psychiatric diseases (F00-F99). The ARR (95% CI) in the model adjusted for O 3 was 1.015 (1.003-1.029) by 10 \u03bcg/m 3 of PM 2.5 on Lag 1 for F40-F49 (Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders). Conclusion: An increase in PM 2.5 showed a significant association with an increase in ED visits for all psychiatric diseases (F00-F99) and for neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (F40-F49) on lag day 1.",

Approximately 4.3 million people visited emergency department for emergency psychiatric diseases in the USA, which accounted for 21 visits per 1000 adults in 2000 [2] . The risk factors must be identified to prevent acute exacerbation of psychiatric diseases. PM 2.5 , which is the abbreviation for particulate matter 2.5 \u03bcm or less in diameter, is one of the most important potential environmental hazards for health conditions and mortality. Ambient PM 2.5 exposure has been found to be a leading cause of death and disability worldwide [3] . A 10 \u03bcg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 corresponds to a 0.68% increase in cardiovascular mortality [4] . Short-term exposure to PM 2.5 induces respiratory hospital admissions [5, 6] , increases total cerebrovascular disease mortality [7] , and even aggravates already diagnosed Parkinson's disease [8] .",

In total, 67,561 patients with psychiatric emergencies (33,041 in 2015 and 34,520 in 2016) were analyzed (Fig. 1) . Table 1 shows the study population and the numbers of ED visits. A total of 67,561 emergency department visits were identified in Seoul from January 2015 to December 2016 (731 days). Emergency department visits for ICD codes F10-F19 (Mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use) represented the largest subgroup, because alcohol abuse was included. Generally, the total ED visits were higher in women than in men, although this trend was not observed in some subgroups. More visits occurred in the summer than in the winter. Table 2 summarizes the key variables. The mean ED (standard deviation) visits for psychiatric diseases and the mean PM 2.5 level was 92 (12) and 24.8 (15. 2) \u03bcg/m 3 . On 121 days corresponding to the 17th percentile, the daily mean PM 2.5 was below 15 \u03bcg/m 3 , which was a level classified as \"good\" by the Korean Meteorological Administration. The daily mean PM 2.5 was above 50 \u03bcg/m 3 , which was a \"bad\" level, on 11 days. Fig. 2 shows the number of ED visits for psychiatric diseases and the daily mean PM 2.5 concentrations for each date. Fig. 3 shows correlations among the pollutants and ED visits. The ED visits for psychiatric disease were not significantly correlated with the daily PM 2.5 concentrations (p = 0.149). Table 3 shows the associations between pollutants (SO 3 , CO, O 3 , and NO 2 ) and ED visits for psychiatric diseases in the GAM models. SO 2 was significantly associated with decreased ED visits for all psychiatric diseases on lag day 1 (0.991, 0982-0.999). CO was also significantly associated with a decrease in ED visit due to F20-F29 (0.966, 0.944-0.989), whereas O 3 was associated with increased ED visits (1.039, 1.001-1.079). Codes F40-F49 were significantly increased on lag day 1 by an increase in NO 2 (1.015, 1.001-1.031). Table 4 shows the associations between PM 2.5 and ED visits for psychiatric diseases. ED visits for all psychiatric diseases were not associated with PM 2.5 in the analyses that were not adjusted for the other pollutants. The ARR (95% CI) in the model adjusted for SO 2 was 1.011 (1.002-1.021) for a 10 \u03bcg/m 3 increment of PM 2.5 on lag day 1 for all psychiatric diseases (F00-F99). The ARR (95% CI) in the model adjusted for O 3 was 1.015 (1.003-1.029) for a 10 \u03bcg/m 3 increment of PM 2.5 on lag day 1 for F40-F49 (Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders).

Their average height from the ground is 14.6 m. Because these buildings and centers are located in residential areas and are highly accessible, measurements from these stations represent the air that the citizens breathe. A total of 15 stations are located at road sides, such as main intersections or public transport stations, where the floating population is very high. Because data from the roadside stations might show different trends than the data from the residential area stations and the roadside stations were not located in all districts, data from the roadside stations were excluded. Air pollutants are hypothesized to affect the mental status through activation of inflammatory processes, the alteration of immune system, influence on oxidative stress, and alterations in cerebral neurotransmitter concentrations. Because absorption and chemical reactions take time, using the daily mean concentrations of pollutants rather than other values, such as the maximum, is a reasonable approach. Although most studies use daily mean concentrations of air pollutants except for O 3 , one journal uses the standard deviations of air pollutants (PM 10 ) as well as the daily mean concentrations [19] . Because air pollutants increase and decrease through chemical reactions, the air pollutant concentrations are expected to increase or decrease faster when the daily mean concentration is higher. Because the daily mean concentration and standard deviation were positively associated, as mentioned in one article [19] , we only used the daily mean concentration. In most studies, researchers use daily maximal 8-hour averages [20, 21] or the daily maximum values between 0900 and 1800 h in the case of O 3 [22] . This approach is reasonable, because the main cause of O 3 is ultraviolet waves generated by the sun. However, the pollution ozone can be produced by traffic exhaust which may be increased in the evening to night time in a metropolis. [23] Nonetheless, in our data, the O 3 concentrations were sometimes higher during the night than during the day. Because using the daily maximal 8-hour average of O 3 would represent a time bias, we used the daily mean O 3 concentration.",

The study in Tianjin reported that an increase of 10 \u03bcg/m 3 in the 2-day average concentrations of PM 10 , SO 2 , and NO 2 corresponded to increases in daily hospital admissions of 0.15%, 0.49%, and 0.57%, respectively [24] . According to a study in Shanghai, increases in PM 10 , SO 2 , and CO increased hospital admissions for psychiatric diseases by 1.27%, 6.88%, and 0.16% per 10 \u03bcg/m 3 increase, respectively [25] . The study in Beijing reported that PM 10 showed a significant association with hospital admissions for psychiatric diseases [26] . Although the results of the three studies were different, PM 10 was commonly associated with hospital admissions for psychiatric diseases. The types of pollutants that showed significant associations with emergency room visits varied by study, as did the extent to which air pollutants affected hospital visits. These inconsistent outcomes may be due to the different climatic environments of different cities. Unlike Korea, the reason for the significant results in China may be that the PM 2.5 concentration in China is 203 times higher than the concentration. Although PM 2.5 had a significant effect over a time span longer than 3 days, we only evaluated the association between PM 2.5 and ED visits for a lag of 1 to 3 days. Previous studies have included longer lags for mortality outcomes due to pollutants. However, a maximum lag of three days was used in the GAM model in this study to test the abrupt association between exposure and outcomes. Some studies reported significant associations of specific subtypes of psychiatric diseases with air pollutants. Both the study conducted in Seoul, Korea, and the study conducted in Canada reported that SO 2 , PM 10 , NO 2 , and CO were positively associated with emergency department visits for depression [11, 12] . The study in Beijing also reported that an increase in the PM 10 concentration of 10 \u03bcg/m 3 corresponded to an increase in hospital admissions for schizophrenia of 1.74% [26] . In the study conducted in Seoul, Korea, the association was more significant when the patients were older and had background illnesses, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus.",

The NEDIS database was started to collect basic, clinical, diagnostic, and prognostic information for all emergency department patients in 2004. The data are used for ED evaluation programs by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and for reimbursement of the national health insurance program. Although the diagnostic codes in usual claims data may be incorrect in number of patients, NEDIS is required to include the exact diagnostic codes for the annual national evaluation program for all EDs.",

However, PM 2.5 did not increase the risk of or exacerbate other psychiatric diseases, such as major depression (mood disorder) or psychosis (schizophrenia). Additional research could develop a public health alert system for specific air pollutants associated with psychiatric emergencies, which could be used to prevent psychiatric emergencies in vulnerable populations.",
