A variety of effective vaccines are available from various manufacturers, either alone or in combination with distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parainfluenza, and bordetella vaccines. Although concern has been expressed about potential immunosuppression by attenuated canine parvovirus in combined vaccines, these concerns have never been supported by appropriately controlled laboratory studies ; indeed, there is evidence that vaccinal parvovirus is not immunosuppressive. 3 The principal barrier to complete control through vaccination appears to be maternal antibody interference with immunization. It has been known since the late 1950s that the antibody that pups acquire from their dams, prihcipally through the c0lostrum, can suppress response to vaccination. The unexpected finding with respect to canine parvovirus was the duration of this effect (in some cases, for more than 18 weeks after birth). Moreover, there is a period during which maternal antibody titers are too low to prevent infection but are still sufficient to preclude response to vaccination. These latter findings account for the continued occurrence of parvoviral enteritis among vaccinated pups and the inability to eradicate the disease in breeding kennels despite heroic vaccination strategies. Modified live canine parvovirus (CPV) vaccines appear to be less susceptible to maternal antibody interference, and low passage strains may be superior to more highly attenuated strains in this regard.",

Although it is not possible to eliminate the virus from a premise, even by vigorous cleaning, reduced exposure and better overall health of pups appear to increase the likelihood of mild or inapparent infection. Although there are no absolute, experimentally tested vaccination protocols, it appears that pups should be vaccinated first at 6 to 8 weeks of age and then periodically revaccinated until they are 18 to 20 weeks old. The number and timing of the intervening vaccinations depend on a number of factors, including economic considerations and the prevalence of disease in the area. Hence, specific vaccination protocols should be determined on an individual basis. Even so, no vaccination program can completely prevent parvoviral enteritis, and owners need to be informed of this unfortunate reality.",

A typical history is the acquisition of a new pup, the development of diarrhea by the puppy, and the subsequent development of diarrhea by the owner. 22 Several studies have revealed high rates of asymptomatic carriers among the dogs and cats. Carrier rates are higher among young animals and animals housed in crowded or unsanitary conditions. In most studies, fecal cultures from animals with diarrhea yielded C. jejuni significantly more often than did stool cultures from nondiarrheic animals. Nevertheless, campylobacteriosis does not appear to be a common primary cause of illness or mortality among young dogs and cats.

The principal clinical signs of hookworm infection result from the anemia caused by these blood\u00b7sucking parasites. Pups nursing heavily infected bitches develop pale mucous membranes and pass soft to liquid feces during the 2nd or 3rd week after birth. Pups can die of exsanguination during the prepatent period before any hookworm ova are passed in the feces. Older pups may develop severe anemia after exposure to larvae from the bitch or kennel environment. Again, clinical signs may be apparent before hookworm ova are present in the feces. Older pups that are better able to compensate for the blood loss may develop a persistent, initially responsive anemia. 9 Treatment. In young dogs and ~ats that are anemic and debilitated as a resultofhookworm infestation, the parasite must be eliminated as quickly as possible while at the same time providing supportive ~are. Anthelmintics that require only a single dose (pyrantel pamoate or disophenol) are the most rapid and effective. Pyrantel pamoate is preferred over disophenol which, given subcutaneously, requires up to 24 hours for effective elimination of the hookworms. 24 Blood transfusion may be necessary to keep the young animal alive long enough for the anthelmintic to take effect.

Young pets with coccidiosis are usually unthrifty, small for their age and breed, and have poor hair coats. It is qot clear whether these signs are the direct result of coccidiosis or merely a reflection of management conditions that predispose the aniinals to clinical coccidiosis. Diarrhea or loose stools flecked with bright red blood associated with straining and increased frequency of defecation are classic signs of the large bowel disease associated with coccidiosis. Systemic signs are usually absent, although dehydration, depression, and anemia may be seen in severe cases. Cryptosporidiosis is charaCterized by watery diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss. Young animals, especially neonates, are more prone to infection and are more likely to develop clinical illness than are older animals. Although adults appear to develop immunitt to Cryptosporidium, this is not passively transferred to their young. 14 Diagnosis. Diagnosis depends on detecting coccidial oocysts in the feces, either by direct smear or fecal flotation. Small numbers of oocysts in feces from adult animals or otherwise healthy puppies are insignificant. Free merozoites in feces or in colonic washes Indicate epitheliai destruction as the result of protozoal multiplication and differentiate clinical from incidental coccidiosis. The diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis js difficult. The oocysts are small (3 to 5 J.l-m) and easily overlooked or confused with yeast. The organisms in feces can be identified with a sirriple iodine-stained wet mount, but various acid-fast stains help to verify the diagnosis; cryptosporidial oocysts stain red, whereas yeast stains blue-green: 14 Sheather' s sugar flotation concentration technique can be used if the results of a wet mount or stained smears are negative.",

Definitive diagnosis can seldom be established solely on the basis of history and physical examination because the clinical signs of all three diseases overlap to a considerable degree.

Idiopathic megaesophagus is characterized by a large, flaccid, dilated esophagus filled with ingesta, fluid, and air. In megaesophagus resulting from a neuromuscular disorder, the dilatation is evident throughout the length of the thoracic esophagus; in vascular ring anomalies, the dilatation is restricted to the esophagus cranial to the heart. Plain radiographs can also reveal the presence and degree of complications such as aspiration pneumonia, mediastinitis, and pleuritis.",

Gross muscular hypertrophy of the pylorus, resulting in pyloric stenosis, occurs in young pups, probably as a primary congenital abnormality. 15 Likewise, a syndrome of pyloric and esophageal dysfunction has been described in cats, particularly Siamese.

In contrast to the regurgitation associated with esophageal dysfunctions, the vomiting is active, even projectile, and the vomitus is seldom reingested, although affected animals may have ravenous appetites immediately after vomiting.
