Samples were tested using an anti-Zika virus NS1 IgG ELISA kit (anti-Zika Virus ELISA IgG, Euroimmun, Germany) and positives were further processed by microneutralisation in a 96-well format, using Vero cells, 50 pfu of the MRS_OPY_Martinique_PaRi_2015 strain14 and a threshold titer of 40 as recommended by the French National Reference Centre for Arboviruses. The seroprevalence after seroneutralisation was s1=13.5% in early March and s2=42.2% in early June. Since it takes about two weeks for an infected individual to seroconvert, we assumed that seroprevalence at the first time point measured the cumulative infection attack rate on W1=week 9 of 2016 (29 Feb -6 Mar) while the second time point gave cumulative infection attack rate on W2=week 21 of 2016 (23-29 May).
