We expressed three 26 versions of spike (S) proteins-receptor binding domain (RBD), S1 subunit and S 27 ectodomain-in insect cells. RBD appears monomer in solutions, whereas S1 and S 28 associate into homotrimer with substantial glycosylation. The three proteins confer 29 excellent antigenicity with six convalescent COVID-19 patient sera. Cryo-electron 30 microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer dominate in a 31 unique conformation distinguished from the classic prefusion conformation of 32 coronaviruses by the upper S1 region at lower position ~15 \u00c5 proximal to viral 33 membrane. Such conformation is proposed as an early prefusion state for the SARS-34 CoV-2 spike that may broaden the knowledge of coronavirus and facilitate vaccine 35 development.",

The other conformation essentially 259 resembles the postfusion state. However, we could not find the classic prefusion260 conformation in our sample. We next tried to figure out at which stage the unique 261 conformation occurs during the spike conformation change. The space relationship of 262 NTD or RBD to S2 domain in the unique, RBD-down and RBD-up prefusion 263 conformations (Fig. 5A) was measured by a reference plant approximately parallel to 264 the viral membrane. The plane is defined by the positions of three equivalent C\u03b1 atoms 265 (residue 694 be used) from three S2 subunits of the trimer structures. Numerical data 266 shows that (1) the NTD and RBD in the unique conformation retain the lowest position 267 in the three prefusion conformations; (2) the NTD and RBD of RBD-down prefusion 268 stretch upward 16.6\u00b0 rotation/16 \u00c5 elevation, and 13.1\u00b0/18 \u00c5, respectively, with respect 269 to the unique conformation; (3) from RBD-down to RBD-up prefusion state, the RBD 270 elevates 9 \u00c5 with an additional rotation whereas the NTD remaining nearly stationary 271 (Supplementary Movie S1).

For S1 construct contains gene encoding aa 15-342 680 followed by a 10-His tag. The RBD construct (aa 319-541) also contains 10-his tag 343 to facilitate purification. In all three constructs, the natural signal peptide (aa 1-14 344 analyzed by SignalP tool) was replaced with a gp67 secretion signal peptide at N-345 terminus.",
