            "text": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute self-limiting inflammatory disorder, associated with vasculitis, affecting predominantly medium-sized arteries, particularly the coronary arteries. In developed countries KD is the commonest cause of acquired heart disease in childhood. The aetiology of KD remains unknown, and it is currently believed that one or more as yet unidentified infectious agents induce an intense inflammatory host response in genetically susceptible individuals. Genetic studies have identified several susceptibility genes for KD and its sequelae in different ethnic populations, including FCGR2A, CD40, ITPKC, FAM167A-BLK and CASP3, as well as genes influencing response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aneurysm formation such as FCGR3B, and transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03b2 pathway genes. IVIG and aspirin are effective therapeutically, but recent clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that the addition of corticosteroids to IVIG is beneficial for the prevention of coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) in severe cases with highest risk of IVIG resistance. Outside of Japan, however, clinical scores to predict IVIG resistance perform suboptimally. Furthermore, the evidence base does not provide clear guidance on which corticosteroid regimen is most effective. Other therapies, including anti-TNF\u03b1, could also have a role for IVIG-resistant KD. Irrespective of these caveats, it is clear that therapy that reduces inflammation in acute KD, improves outcome. This paper summarises recent advances in the understanding of KD pathogenesis and therapeutics, and provides an approach for managing KD patients in the UK in the light of these advances.",

[6] [7] [8] [9] In view of the frequency and severity of coronary artery complications, there has been intense interest in treatments to reduce the risk of CAA. 6 [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] KD is also potentially an important cause of long-term cardiac disease in adult life. 6 7 Notably, as more children with KD are advancing into adulthood, further studies are needed to (1) improve our understanding of longterm cardiac sequelae, (2) optimise therapy in childhood to minimise risks in adulthood and to ensure the continuation of quality, evidence-based care for KD patients as they transit to adult services.",

            "text": "The aetiology of KD remains unknown. Pronounced seasonality and clustering of KD cases have led to the hunt for infectious agents as a cause. So far, however, no single agent has been consistently identified. [19] [20] [21] Many published reports implicate a number of bacterial and viral pathogens, including retroviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, coronavirus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens, and unidentified virus particles as infectious triggers of KD. 2 5 To date, no single pathogen has been confirmed in subsequent studies. The debate regarding the infectious cause of KD has centred around the mechanism of immune activation: conventional antigen versus superantigen (SAg). 22 23 Superantigens seemed a plausible cause of the disorder in view of the clinical and immunological similarity between KD and staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigenmediated disorders. Several studies have presented Open Access Scan to access more free content evidence supporting superantigen-triggered process, but others have not confirmed the association. 5 22 24 One explanation for the inconsistent finding is that KD is triggered by a range of different superantigens, and animal studies suggest the possibility that both superantigen, and Toll-like receptor agonists may need to act synergistically. 5 25 Against a superantigen (SAg)-mediated process is the report by Rowley et al 26 of three fatal cases of KD in which IgA plasma cell infiltration into the vascular wall during the acute phase of the illness was observed. By examining the clonality of this IgA response using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR in lesional vascular tissue, these researchers observed that the IgA response was oligoclonal, suggesting a conventional antigenic process rather than a superantigenic-driven one. 26 Although uncertainty remains regarding the mechanism(s) of initial immune activation, most authorities believe that one or more potentially ubiquitous infectious agents produces a deleterious host response in a genetically susceptible subject. 2 5 9 Genetics A genetic contribution to the risk of KD is suggested by the much higher risk of the disease in Asian children, particularly the Japanese and Koreans, which persists when patients of these ethnicities migrate to other countries 27 ; from the observed increased relative risk to siblings of index cases compared with the general population, from twin studies and from well documented multicase families. 28 Many candidate genes have previously been suggested, either as susceptibility genes for developing KD; or increasing risk of CAA. [29] [30] [31] These are summarised elsewhere. 31 Most of these earlier studies, however, failed to identify definitive genetic associations, emphasising the difficulties of the candidate gene approach for a disease where the pathogenesis is poorly understood. 32 By contrast with the candidate gene approach, genomewide association studies (GWAS) have the advantage of identifying disease-associated genes without requiring prior knowledge of the mechanisms involved. 32 A number of GWAS of KD have been published so far. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] From these studies, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with susceptibility to KD, including ITPKC, ABCC4 and FCGR2A, CD40 and a gene region near FAM167A-BLK (table 1) . Furthermore, other genes have been associated with non-response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and risk of CAA, including CASP3, FCGR3B and genes of the TGF-\u03b2 signalling pathway. 40 41 It is likely that many other genetic factors have yet to be identified, as the GWAS methodology has so far only identified the most significant associations. 32 Whole exome sequencing studies applied to individual KD cases of extreme phenotype, such as those with giant CAA, could clarify the contribution of rarer genetic variants in these extreme cases. Thus, the study of the genetic contribution to KD remains an intense area of research worldwide, and still very much a work in progress.",

For the diagnosis to be established according to the Diagnostic Guidelines of the Japan KD Research Committee, five of the six criteria in table 2 should be present. 42 The North American recommendations for the diagnosis are similar, except Taiwanese, Japanese CD40 L is expressed on the surface of CD4 T-cells and platelets, and engages with CD40 expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells or endothelial cells. Transduces signals related to cell activation or development. Elevated expression of CD40 L during acute-phase KD, and significantly higher expression in KD patients with CAA have been reported. 34 CAA, coronary artery aneurysms; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells. that fever is a mandatory criterion, and four of the remaining five criteria are required to establish the diagnosis. 6 However, in addition to patients fulfilling the criteria for complete KD, many patients have some but not all of the clinical features of KD. These patients may still be, or are, at risk of CAA. Diagnosis of these 'Incomplete KD' cases depends on a high level of suspicion in children presenting with some of the KD features and evidence of systemic inflammation (such as elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), or leucocytosis). Early echocardiography may reveal evidence of coronary vasculitis, confirming the diagnosis of KD in this patient group. A negative echocardiogram does not exclude the diagnosis of KD. In addition to the diagnostic challenge of incomplete cases, the requirement within the existing diagnostic criterion for a fever of greater than 5 days may also lead to delayed treatment. While duration of fever has historically been of importance for the standardisation of case definitions, clinicians should not delay in making a diagnosis of KD and instituting treatment (see below) if: (1) 5/6 diagnostic criteria of KD are present before day 5 of fever; (2) CAA or coronary dilatation are present, or (3) evidence of persistent elevation of inflammatory markers with no other explanation in patients where there remains clinical suspicion of KD. 2 6 9 We recommend seeking early expert advice in such cases. Irritability is an important sign which is nearly always present, although interestingly not included as one of the diagnostic criteria. 9 43 The exact mechanism of the irritability is unclear, but it may be related to the presence of aseptic meningitis. 9 43 Another important clinical sign is the development of erythema and induration at the site of previous Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immunisation. 9 44 The mechanism of this clinical sign is believed to be due to cross-reactivity of T cells in KD patients between specific epitopes of mycobacterial and human heat-shock proteins. 9 44 The diagnostic criteria may present sequentially, such that a so-called 'incomplete' case can evolve with time into a 'complete' case. 6 Thus, the diagnosis of KD must be considered in any child with a febrile exanthematous illness and evidence of inflammation, particularly if it persists longer than 4-5 days.",

CAA occur in 15-25% of untreated cases, with additional cardiac features in a significant proportion of these including pericardial effusion, electrocardiographic abnormalities, pericarditis, myocarditis, valvular incompetence, cardiac failure and myocardial infarction. 6 When systemic arterial injury (major limb arteries, renal and other visceral vessels) occurs, it is rarely seen in the absence of CAA. 2 Laboratory findings KD is invariably associated with an inflammatory process, with elevation of ESR, CRP and white cell count. 2 6 9 In the absence of significant inflammation, the diagnosis of KD is unlikely. 2 6 9 Not all the inflammatory markers may be abnormal at first presentation, and repeat blood testing should be undertaken if there is diagnostic uncertainty. Thrombocytosis occurs towards the end of the second week of the illness and, therefore, may not be helpful, diagnostically, in the early stages. 2 6 9 Acute thrombocytopenia or low/normal platelet count may occur and may be associated with a poorer prognosis (see below). 2 6 9 47 Liver function may be deranged and some patients present with jaundice and elevation of transaminases. 2 6 9 Hypoalbuminaemia is common; sterile pyuria and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis ( predominantly lymphocytes) representing aseptic meningitis also occur. 2 6 9 48 Predicting IVIG resistance/high CAA risk Several scoring systems have been developed to identify children at highest risk of IVIG resistance and, hence, highest risk of developing CAA (table 3) . 47 49 50 Kobayashi et al 47 developed a model to predict unresponsiveness to IVIG in Japanese children with KD. This was used to define severe cases in a pivotal ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; CRP, C-reactive protein; IVIG, intravenous immunoglobulin. 47 49-51 clinical trial of corticosteroids(see below), because IVIG resistance is known to be a strong risk factor for the development of CAA. The Kobayashi, Egami and Sano scores when tested in a USA study demonstrated comparably high specificity for predicting IVIG non-response in non-Japanese patients, but had low sensitivity. 51 The clinical implication of this is that if the risk score is 'positive' in a non-Japanese patient (eg, \u22655 for the Kobayashi score) then IVIG resistance is likely; however, a negative score does not reliably exclude IVIG resistance. Attempts to develop a more sensitive and specific score for patients outside of Japan have thus far been unsuccessful. 52 ",

They followed standard guidelines for conduct of meta-analyses, and used defined criteria for trial quality assessment, including evaluation of criteria for diagnosis; study design; follow up and blinding. 60 They identified nine clinical studies meeting their quality criteria, involving 1011 patients. Six out of nine were prospective RCTs; two were non-randomised controlled studies; and one was a retrospective report. 60 Of the 1011 patients included, 536 received IVIG+corticosteroids and 475 IVIG alone. 60 They found that significantly fewer patients receiving IVIG+corticosteroids developed CAA than those receiving IVIG alone (7.6% vs 18.9%; OR: 0.3; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.46). 60 The benefit was found in several subgroup analyses including the six prospective RCTs, and studies using prednisolone or intravenous methylprednisolone. 60 They found no significant differences in frequency of severe adverse events between the steroid and nonsteroid treatment groups. 60 Chen's meta-analysis provides convincing evidence that steroids combined with IVIG as initial treatment reduces overall risk of CAA in severe KD. 60 However, neither the meta analysis nor the RAISE study provides clear answers as to whether all children in the UK should be treated with corticosteroids, and what dose, duration and route of corticosteroids should be used.",

The American study evaluated the use of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) given as a single dose in unselected patients with KD. 10 By contrast, RAISE evaluated lower-dose (2 mg/kg) intravenous prednisolone given for 5 days; if fever settled, this was then converted to oral prednisolone which was subsequently tapered over 15 days only after the CRP normalised. 14 Moreover, patients were included in RAISE only if they were at high risk of IVIG resistance based on the Kobayashi score. 14 Perhaps unsurprisingly then, these two studies have produced conflicting results, with steroids conferring significant benefit in the Japanese RAISE study, but a lack of overall benefit in the American study.",

[63] [64] [65] [66] Serum TNF-\u03b1 is elevated in KD patients, and higher levels correlate with the development of CAA. 67 The most commonly used agent is infliximab, a chimeric murine/ human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specifically binding TNF-\u03b1. [63] [64] [65] [66] In one retrospective study of 17 children with IVIG-resistant KD, infliximab was used successfully with abrupt defervescence in 13/16 febrile patients, with no infusion reactions. 12 Burns et al 68 reported a phase 2 clinical trial including 16 patients receiving infliximab that demonstrated that this treatment was safe and well tolerated in patients resistant to IVIG. Response to therapy with cessation of fever occurred in 13 of 16 patients. CRP level was elevated in all but one patient before infliximab infusion, and the level was lower following infusion in all 10 patients in whom it was remeasured within 48 h of treatment. 68 There were no infusion reactions to infliximab, and no complications attributed to infliximab administration in any of the patients. 68 A more recent US retrospective review of IVIG-resistant patients treated with either IVIG (n=86) or infliximab (n=20) demonstrated that patients treated with infliximab had fewer days of fever and shorter hospitalisation, but with similar coronary artery outcomes. 69 Etanercept (soluble TNF-\u03b1 receptor) is an alternative TNF antagonist, and has been reported to be safe and well tolerated in 15 children with KD when given at a dose of 0.8 mg per kilogram weekly for three doses, and may be beneficial. 70 A recent multicentre study in the USA comparing IVIG and aspirin to IVIG/aspirin plus infliximab as initial therapy in an unselected group of KD patients has been completed and showed no significant reduction in CAA, although the trial was underpowered for this endpoint. There was, however, faster resolution of the acute-phase response in the infliximab group. (Burns JC et al, personal communication and manuscript submitted). Thus, anti-TNF\u03b1 should be considered in patients with IVIG-resistant KD, and further study is required of its role as first-line therapy.",

            "text": "provide more up-to-date outcome data for the UK. Angiographic resolution 1-2 years after onset of disease has been observed in 50-70% of vessels with coronary aneurysms; giant aneurysms never resolve completely. [77] [78] [79] In a study exploring the long-term outcomes of a cohort of 6576 patients with KD enrolled between 1982 and 2004, the mortality rate for patients without cardiac sequelae in the acute phase of the disease, and for female patients with sequelae, did not differ from the normal population. 80 The all-cause mortality rate of males with cardiac sequelae was, however, 2.4 times higher than the normal population. 80 All patients with KD should undergo echocardiography at diagnosis and 6-8 weeks after the onset of the disease. 6 9 An intermediate echocardiogram at 10-14 days of disease onset should be performed if the initial echo was normal and the disease activity has been arrested. 6 9 Echocardiography should be performed at least weekly in those with aneurysms detected on initial echocardiography (ECHO) and those with ongoing active inflammation to monitor aneurysm size progression, or the development of thrombus formation. 6 9 Long-term aspirin at 2-5 mg/kg/day is recommended for those with persisting aneurysms on echocardiography. 6 9 This can be discontinued if the aneurysms resolve. Depending on the size of the aneurysms, electrocardiography and echocardiography performed 6-12 monthly is recommended. 6 9 In patients with persistent aneurysms beyond 6 weeks, longterm cardiovascular follow-up into adult life is required. 6 9 There may be echocardiographic resolution of the aneurysm over time. 6 9 This is due to vessel remodelling, with fibrosis, and proliferation of subendothelial tissues. 6 9 The lesion may remain thickened and abnormal even after echocardiographic resolution. 6 9 The prognosis is guarded for those with giant aneurysms. 6 9 A recent single-centre study described a cohort of 76 Japanese KD patients with giant aneurysms (>8 mm internal diameter) who had a 30-year survival rate of 88%, and a cumulative intervention rate (catheter or surgical) of 59%, 25 years postacute KD 81 ; 16% developed myocardial infarction. 81 As more patients with a history of KD and coronary aneurysms reach young adulthood, acute mycocardial infarction due to thrombosis of aneurysms, or due to progressive arterial stenosis from aneurysm remodelling is of increasing concern. 82 83 Of note, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is associated with a high rate of restenosis or occlusion in KD patients, thus rotational ablation or bypass surgery may be advisable as an alternative procedure. 83 Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) can play an important role during interventions in patients with a history of KD by helping to determine the extent of arterial calcification, and by evaluating intervention results to ensure proper stent sizing and placement. 83 84 Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is also used in patients after KD for severe obstructive lesions, and results have generally been good, especially when the internal thoracic artery is used. 83 85 86 In the setting of giant coronary aneurysms without significant obstruction, CABG may be ineffective in preventing myocardial infarction, as graft patency may be compromised by competing flow from the native coronary artery. 83 85 86 Recommendations for long-term cardiac management A detailed review of this area is beyond the scope of this article. A statement of the American Heart Association committee on rheumatic fever, endocarditis and KD published in 2004 provided detailed guidance on the stratification of KD patients according to their relative risk of myocardial ischaemia. 6 Risk-level categories are summarised in table 4. This stratification allows for patient management to be individualised with respect to medical therapy to reduce the risk of thrombosis, physical activity, frequency of clinical follow-up and diagnostic testing, and indications for cardiac catheterisation and coronary, CT and MR angiography. 6 Stress echocardiography when considered safe by cardiologists, should be performed on all patients with persistent structural abnormalities of the coronary arteries. 6 If there is evidence of inducible ischaemia, then invasive angiography is indicated. 6 For these patients, bi-annual follow-up and aggressive management of traditional cardiovascular risk factors is also recommended for all patients. 6 CT coronary artery calcium scores are linked to mortality in atherosclerosis; it has been suggested that this imaging modality could have an important role in the late follow-up of KD. 87 Adolescents and young adults may develop coronary calcification that is detectable only more than 10 years after the acute KD episode; while promising as a potential means of stratifying patients for a long-term follow-up, it is not yet known in KD exactly how coronary artery scores relate to late morbidity or mortality.",

            "text": "Since the recognition that IVIG could reduce the morbidity and mortality of KD, treatment of this condition has been largely protocol driven. Although authorities differ in their advocacy for a variety of treatment protocols, it is likely that the success of therapeutic intervention in KD is due to modulation of the causes and/or propagators of inflammation. As such we have re-evaluated the current prescriptive approach to the management of KD in the light of the published literature, adding corticosteroids into primary therapy for severe and IVIG unresponsive cases; and suggesting a role for anti-TNF-\u03b1 if systemic inflammation persists despite IVIG, aspirin and corticosteroids. Repeated protocol-driven administration of IVIG in patients with little evidence of clinical and/or laboratory improvement may be detrimental, and treatment with corticosteroids and/or anti-TNF\u03b1 considered. Unchecked inflammation damages the vasculature in KD; the acute-phase response, particularly CRP, combined with clinical response can be used to assess the efficacy of any intervention. A minimum of three echocardiograms should be performed in the first 6 weeks of the illness. The justification for this is: (1) some patients (albeit a minority) can develop CAA in the first week of the illness, 6 and early detection of these should prompt more aggressive primary management; (2) early echocardiography (in the first week) may detect extracoronary manifestations, such as mitral regurgitation or pericardial effusion, that may be associated with increased risk of CAA 62 (3) early detection of CAA progression and/or development of thrombus might be detected that could result in intensification of anti-inflammatory and/or additional anticoagulation therapy. With this philosophy in mind, and in light of the therapeutic advances discussed above, we present an updated clinical guideline 9 for the management of KD in the UK (figure 1).",

Studies are also needed to identify biomarkers and clinical scores that work outside of Japan to identify patients at highest risk of CAA and, hence, the need for the addition of corticosteroids and/or anti-TNF in the primary treatment. Concerted international efforts aiming at improving our understanding of the potential infectious trigger, and genetic contribution to KD disease susceptibility or complications are of utmost importance Whether or not KD predisposes to premature atherosclerosis, or more correctly, late-KD vasculopathy, is the subject of an ongoing UK study, and will help provide an evidence base to inform long-term management strategies in the UK.
