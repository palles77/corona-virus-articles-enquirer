            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is caused by a single stranded RNA virus belonging to the Arteriviridae family (Meulenberg et al., 1994) . PRRSV is endemic in most pig producing countries of the world. Infection with PRRSV causes reproductive disease in sows with abortions and stillbirths at all stages of gestation. In growing pigs, increased pre-weaning mortality, inappetance and respiratory disorders can be observed. PRRSV is considered a primary pathogen, but co-infections with bacterial or viral pathogens commonly occur and exacerbate the clinical symptoms in growing pigs (reviewed by Drew, 2000) . As a consequence of both primary and secondary infections with PRRSV, significant economic losses and welfare problems are observed in the swine industry worldwide (Neumann et al., 2005) . Veterinary Microbiology 174 (2014) [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is difficult to control due to a high mutation rate of the PRRS virus (PRRSV) and the emergence of virulent strains. The objective of this study was to analyse early and late pathological responses in the respiratory tract after infection with the European PRRSV subtype 3 strain Lena in comparison to two European PRRSV subtype 1 strains: Belgium A and Lelystad-Ter Huurne (LV). For each virus strain, groups of twelve pigs were inoculated, and four pigs per group were euthanized at days 3, 7 and 35 post-infection (p.i.) for consecutive examination. Infection with strain Lena resulted in a more severe disease than with the subtype 1 strains, an inflammatory response within the first week of infection with expression of IL-1a in the lung and lymph node, and an influx of neutrophils and monocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Infection with strain Belgium A or LV resulted in mild or no pathology within the first week of infection, but inflammatory cell influx in the lung interstititium was increased at the end of the experiment at day 35 p.i. At five weeks p.i., all strains induced a higher percentage of cytotoxic T cells and higher levels of IFN-g producing cells in BALF. This might have contributed to clearance of virus. In general, subtype 3 strain Lena induced a stronger early inflammatory response which led to more severe clinical disease and pathology. On the other hand, this may have supported an enhanced or faster clearance of virus in tissues, compared to subtype 1 strains.",

            "text": "PRRSV is divided into two genotypes, the European PRRSV and the North American PRRSV. These genotypes have a high degree of genetic divergence (Wensvoort et al., 1991; Collins et al., 1992 ; reviewed by Stadejek et al., 2013) . The European genotype strains can be further divided into at least three subtypes: Pan-European subtype 1 and Eastern European subtypes 2 and 3 (Stadejek et al., 2008) . The pathogenicity of European genotype subtype 1 strains and North American genotype strains has been studied several times. In general, North American genotype strains show a larger variation in pathogenicity than European genotype subtype 1 strains. In several experimental studies more severe respiratory disease has been observed with North American genotype strains (Halbur et al., 1995 (Halbur et al., , 1996 Van der Linden et al., 2003; Mart\u00ednez-Lobo et al., 2011; reviewed by G\u00f3 mez-Laguna et al., 2013; Han et al., 2013a,b) . Only limited information is available about European subtype 2 and 3 strains. Subtype 3 strains were described to be more virulent than subtype 1 strains in experimentally infected pigs (Karniychuk et al., 2010; Morgan et al., 2013; Weesendorp et al., 2013a,b) . In a previous study (Weesendorp et al., 2013a,b) we analysed the systemic responses of pigs after infection with two European subtype 1 strains, and one subtype 3 strain. The present study focuses specifically on the respiratory tract of these pigs, by characterizing the local immunological and pathological responses. It was shown that the subtype 3 strain Lena induced a stronger early inflammatory response which resulted in more severe clinical disease and lung pathology than observed after infection with subtype 1 strains Belgium A or Lelystad-Ter Huurne (LV). Interestingly, although subtype 1 strains did not induce clinical disease, these strains induced more severe longterm microscopic lung lesions to the infection than the subtype 3 strain. On the other hand, the early inflammatory response of strain Lena might have enhanced a faster clearance of virus than observed after infection with subtype 1 strains.",

Pigs were housed in four groups in different rooms of an isolation unit. Pigs were inoculated intranasally with 1.5 ml inoculum containing 10 5 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) of either European subtype 1 strain Belgium A, strain LV, European subtype 3 strain Lena, or an equal volume of PBS (group control). In each group, four pigs were vaccinated with an Aujeszky's disease vaccine, but these pigs were excluded from the present study. At days 3, 7 and 35 post-infection (p.i.), four pigs per group were euthanized for post-mortem examination. Rectal temperatures and clinical symptoms were recorded daily. Viraemia was analysed in serum at days 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 26 and 33 p.i. Results of viraemia were presented in detail by Weesendorp et al. (2013a) . Gross pathology examination of the lungs was performed by one examiner, who was blinded in regard to treatment. Areas of macroscopically altered lung tissue (colour, consistency) which are an indication of inflammatory alterations were assessed on the ventral and dorsal view of the lungs and true to scale drawings recorded on one lung sketch. From this sketch the proportion of affected lung was estimated. Tissue samples were collected from three predefined locations of the right lung, i.e. from the apical lobe, the cardiac lobe and the caudoventral diaphragmatic lobe, tracheobronchial lymph node (from now on referred to as 'lymph node'), and spleen. Tissue samples were fixed in 4% formaldehyde by immersion and processed for histological examination. Complementary parts of the lung, lymph node and spleen samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u00c080 8C until total RNA was isolated from these samples.",

Other lung sections were used to determine the presence of PRRSV antigen in tissue and to characterize the infiltration of lymphocytic cells by staining CD3 positive cells. For immunohistochemical (IHC) detection, thin sections were mounted on poly-Llysine coated slides, deparaffinised and treated with 3% hydrogen peroxidase to block endogenous peroxidase. To detect PRRSV antigen in the tissue slides, the monoclonal antibody SDOW17 (specific for the nucleocapsid antigen of PRRSV, Rural Technologies, Inc. 1 ) was used. To detect CD3 expressing cells (only applied at days 3 and 7 p.i.), an anti-human CD3 antibody was used. Bound antibody was visualized by using the EnVison TM Detection system followed by incubation with diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogenic substrate, which results in a dark brown staining of bound primary antibody sites. Slides were counterstained with haematoxylin. A semi-quantitative, pathohistological assessment of the H&E stained slides was performed by one pathologist, who was blinded in regard of treatment. The examination encompassed the extent of pneumonia in each slide, i.e. presence of focal or diffuse alterations with interstitial or catarrhal pneumonia or atelectasis, the extent of infiltration of alveolar septae with mononuclear cells and the extent of infiltration of mononuclear cells in the perivascular/peribronchiolar area. A histological score from 0, i.e. no findings, 1 = mild focal manifestation, 2 = moderate, multifocal manifestation, 3 = moderate diffuse manifestation, 4 = severe diffuse manifestation and 5 = very severe extended manifestation was used to describe the severity of changes. To compare the histological findings between groups, the scores from each slide per lung were added to an overall score, which could add up to a maximum of 15.",

In the study of Morgan et al.

In the study of Morgan et al.

Interestingly, subtype 1 strains generated at day 35 p.i. more severe microscopic lung lesions to the infection than the subtype 3 strain. Thus, despite the absence of clinical symptoms or manifestations of pneumonia, PRRSV infection has induced long-term interstitial changes, which can contribute to a higher susceptibility to secondary infections, which potentially exacerbates clinical symptoms and pathology as observed in the field (reviewed by G\u00f3 mez-Laguna et al., 2013) .",

The strain Lena-infected pigs induced higher levels of the proinflammatory IL-1b and TNFa mRNA in blood cells (Weesendorp et al., 2013a,b) and a higher level of IL-1b mRNA expression in the lymph node and lung. A correlation between the pathogenicity of the strain and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was also described by other authors (reviewed by G\u00f3 mez-Laguna et al., 2013; Han et al., 2014) . In pigs infected with highly pathogenic PRRSV strains, clinical disease was related to severe interstitial pneumonia and high expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1b and TNF-a in the lungs compared to less virulent PRRSV strains. IL-1b and TNF-a production cause chemotaxis of monocytes and neutrophils (Van Reeth and Nauwynck, 2000; reviewed by G\u00f3 mez-Laguna et al., 2013) , of which we observed a higher percentage in BALF. Release of enzymes, free radicals and inflammatory cytokines from the neutrophils can then also contribute to the lung pathology (Han et al., 2014) that was observed after infection with strain Lena.",

IFN-a is the prototypic antiviral cytokine that suppresses initial viral replication and promotes the adaptive immune response (reviewed by Kimman et al., 2009) . For PRRSV, it has been shown in vitro that the type I IFN response is suppressed (Ait-Ali et al., 2011) , but there are conflicting reports of PRRSV inhibiting or inducing a type I IFN response in vivo (Van Reeth et al., 1999; G\u00f3 mez-Laguna et al., 2009) . In blood (Weesendorp et al., 2013a,b) , we observed an induction of IFN-a of the Lena and Belgium A strain at day 7 p.i., when the virus load was at a peak level. Blood cells responded to the virus by an inflammatory response with production of IFN-a and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1b and TNF-a. In tissues, however, we observed mostly a downregulation of IFN-a. Downregulation of IFN-a in the tissues might be one of the mechanisms of the virus to facilitate PRRSV replication (Murtaugh et al., 2002) .",
