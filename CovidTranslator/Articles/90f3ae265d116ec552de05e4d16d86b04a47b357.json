            "text": "Borna disease virus (BDV) can persistently infect the central nervous system of a broad range of mammalian species. Mice are resistant to infections with primary BDV isolates, but certain laboratory strains can be adapted to replicate in mice. We determined the molecular basis of adaptation by studying mutations acquired by a cDNA-derived BDV strain during one brain passage in rats and three passages in mice. The adapted virus propagated efficiently in mouse brains and induced neurological disease. Its genome contained seven point mutations, three of which caused amino acid changes in the L polymerase (L1116R and N1398D) and in the polymerase cofactor P (R66K). Recombinant BDV carrying these mutations either alone or in combination all showed enhanced multiplication speed in Vero cells, indicating improved intrinsic viral polymerase activity rather than adaptation to a mouse-specific factor. Mutations R66K and L1116R, but not N1398D, conferred replication competence of recombinant BDV in mice if introduced individually. Virus propagation in mouse brains was substantially enhanced if both L mutations were present simultaneously, but infection remained mostly nonsymptomatic. Only if all three amino acid substitutions were combined did BDV replicate vigorously and induce early disease in mice. Interestingly, the virulence-enhancing effect of the R66K mutation in P could be attributed to reduced negative regulation of polymerase activity by the viral X protein. Our data demonstrate that BDV replication competence in mice is mediated by the polymerase complex rather than the viral envelope and suggest that altered regulation of viral gene expression can favor adaptation to new host species.",

            "text": "Viruses acquiring the ability to multiply in a new host species are of great concern for public health. Viruses of animal origin that have successfully entered the human species are the causative agents of important infectious diseases, such as AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and pandemic influenza (5, 13, 30) . The molecular basis of virus adaptation to new host species is poorly understood. It is clear that adaptation can result from mutations in viral envelope components which may alter the receptor specificity or uptake efficacy of the virus. For example, massive structural alterations of the envelope seem to have occurred during adaptation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus from bats to humans (18) . Recently, it became clear that alternative mechanisms can also lead to successful virus adaptation to new host species. In the case of the avian influenza A virus strain SC35, two amino acid changes in the PB2 polymerase subunit which enhance the activity of the viral polymerase complex can confer viral replication competence in mice (4) . Similarly, a glutamic acid-tolysine change at position 627 of the PB2 protein rendered an avian H5N1 influenza A virus isolate highly pathogenic for mice (8, 25) . In the case of Ebola virus, adaptation to mice was associated with mutations in VP24 and in the nucleoprotein, both of which antagonize the innate antiviral immune response (3) . These examples illustrate that several factors can determine the species specificity of a virus.",

The BDV genome of approximately 8,900 nucleotides is transcribed and replicated in the nucleus (1) . Alternative splicing of polycistronic mRNA is employed to regulate viral protein levels. Based on these unique properties, BDV has been classified into a separate virus family (Bornaviridae) in the order Mononegavirales. In naturally and experimentally infected animals, BDV establishes a noncytolytic, persistent infection of the central nervous system (CNS) that frequently results in a severe immune-mediated neurological disorder (28) . Successful experimental infection of a broad range of warm-blooded animals has been reported (26) . Despite obvious promiscuity, most tissue culture-adapted laboratory strains of BDV do not readily infect mice but can be adapted to mice by serial passage in the CNS (7, 9, 12) . In a previous study, four amino acid changes were identified in the mouse-adapted virus, two of which affected the viral glycoprotein G and two the viral polymerase L (12) . However, the relative contributions of these four mutations remained undetermined due to the lack of suitable experimental systems.",

The A7879G mutation causing the N1398D change in L also occurred in the second adaptation experiment. However, this mutation remained incomplete and eventually disappeared. The G1469A mutation causing the R66K change in P that was found at a high frequency in passage 4 of adaptation experiment 1 did not appear in experiment 2 (Table 1) . Similarly, the two mutations in the first intergenic region (positions 1222 and 1229) were not observed in the second adaptation experiment, demonstrating that these changes are not essential for adaptation of BDV to the mouse. In experiment 2, we observed an insertion of two A nucleotides in the first intergenic region at position 1208.

We infected groups of newborn C57BL/6-IFNAR1 0/0 mice with 1,000 FFU of BDV-PK, BDV-LRD, and BDV-PK/LRD. Due to the C57BL/6 background, these animals were not expected to develop neurological disease in response to BDV infection (7) . Three animals of each group were sacrificed at 15, 20, and 25 days postinfection. Protein extracts were prepared from one brain hemisphere and analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of viral N protein. The other hemisphere was paraffin embedded, and sections were analyzed for virus infection by immunostaining for the N protein of BDV. Distinct foci of BDV-positive cells were present in the brains of mice infected with BDV-PK and BDV-LRD at 25 days postinfection, whereas substantially lower numbers of virus-positive cells were observed at 15 and 20 days postinfection (Fig. 5A , left and middle). By contrast, in brains of mice infected with BDV-PK/LRD large numbers of BDVpositive cells were found as early as 15 days postinfection (Fig.  5A, right) . Careful analysis of the brain sections at higherpower resolution yielded no evidence for altered cell tropisms of BDV-PK/LRD (data not shown). Western blot analysis confirmed the picture of the histological analysis and showed that at all times postinfection the virus loads in brains of mice infected with BDV-PK/LRD were much higher than those in brains infected with BDV-PK or BDV-LRD (Fig. 5B) .

This was clearly not the case (Fig. 6A) . We then asked whether the P-N and P-X interactions (24) might be influenced by the R66K mutation. Whereas the interaction of PK with N remained strong, we found that PK interacted only very poorly with X (Fig. 6A ). This is of great interest as the X protein was shown to inhibit the viral polymerase activity at least in vitro (15) .

Strong inhibition of complexes containing wild-type P was observed when 16 ng of plasmid encoding X was cotransfected in our standard assay (Fig. 6B ). Since PK interacted poorly with X (Fig. 6A) , we determined whether polymerase complexes containing this P mutant might resist inhibition by X. When 32 ng of plasmid encoding X was used, the activities of BDV polymerase complexes containing PK remained almost unaffected (Fig. 6B) . These results thus strongly indicated that viruses with the R66K mutation in P are no longer responding properly to negative regulation by X, which could explain the enhanced virulence. Enhanced transcriptional activity of BDV-LRD. Since minireplicon assays with reconstituted viral polymerase complexes could not explain the enhanced virulence of the BDV variant carrying the LRD mutation, we turned to a less artificial assay system and performed a careful comparison of viral RNA synthesis in acutely infected Vero cells. We argued that the full transcriptional potential of the viral polymerase complex should become visible at very early times after infection of susceptible host cells. To mimic a state of acute infection, we mixed persistently infected cells with uninfected cells at various ratios and cocultured the cell mixtures for 7 days. At this stage, we determined the percentages of virus-infected cells in the cultures by immunofluorescence and measured the content of viral RNA by Northern blotting. As expected, BDV-LRD spread more efficiently to uninfected Vero cells than wild-type BDV (Fig. 7) . We noted that viral transcript levels in cultures that contained about 20% acutely infected cells were substantially different. Viral mRNA was about fourfold more abundant in cultures infected to \u03f320% with BDV-LRD than in cultures infected to roughly the same degree with wild-type BDV, which is shown by quantification of the 0.8-kb mRNA (Fig. 7, compare lanes 2 and 8) . Approximately twofold-enhanced levels of viral transcripts were seen in cultures which contained 70 to 80% infected cells (Fig. 7, compare lanes 3 and  9) . This difference was less pronounced in persistently infected cultures. These data indicate that at least during the acute phase of infection, polymerase complexes containing LRD exhibit higher activities than complexes containing wild-type L.",

These observations suggested that by growing BDV in the rat brain, virus mutants with increased fitness for replication in mouse brains which do not seem to accumulate in Vero cells are selected. The molecular basis for this phenomenon is unclear. As cells persistently infected with BDV are resistant to superinfection (6), BDV variants generated in persistently infected Vero cell cultures may not be able to compete with parental virus even if they carry advantageous mutations. Variants generated in the infected rat brain might spread more efficiently than wild-type virus because of the very large number of susceptible cells in this organ.",

Since the L1116R mutation appeared early in both of our two independent adaptation experiments and since this mutation was already present after the first rat brain passage in at least one experiment, it appears that the molecularly cloned virus used here is strongly biased with regard to acquiring this specific mutation in rodent cells.

Interestingly, the R66K mutation by itself was also able to mediate replication competence of BDV in mice, although this mutation was not detected alone at any stage of the adaptation process. This finding reinforces our conclusion that several different mutations in the viral polymerase complex may confer replication competence in mice. We assume that the biased evolutionary drift of molecularly cloned BDV toward quick acquisition of the L1116R mutation in the L polymerase subunit might suppress alternative adaptation routes. One of the most interesting observations of this study was that by specifically screening for virus growth in mouse brains, we selected virus mutants with greatly improved virulence. We found that recombinant viruses carrying both polymerase mutations either alone (LRD) or in combination with the R66K mutation in P (PK/LRD) exhibited substantially enhanced growth kinetics in Vero cells as well as in MEF of C57BL/6-IFNAR1 0/0 mice ( Fig. 3A and B) . These results indicate that the adaptive mutations do not improve the specific interaction of the viral polymerase complex with unidentified mouse-specific factors. In agreement with this view, we recently showed that the LRD form of the polymerase can restore efficient replication in Vero cells and rats in severely attenuated BDV mutants (16, 20) . Our data indicate that the mouse-adapted viruses acquired mutations which enhance polymerase performance in host cells of various species. We assume that although mouse cells provide all factors necessary for virus replication, for unknown reasons they still represent intrinsically poor host cells for BDV. We suggest that in such poor host cells standard virus may not perform well, whereas virus with improved polymerase does.",

Important clues came from studies aimed at measuring the strength of the interactions between the various viral polymerase subunits. We found that the R66K form of P interacted only very poorly with the viral negative regulator X (Fig. 6A ). Using artificial viral genomes, we could further show that polymerase complexes containing the R66K form of P were much less sensitive to negative regulation by X (Fig. 6B) . These data indicated that the enhanced performance levels of the polymerase complexes of mouse-adapted viruses carrying the R66K mutation do not result from an intrinsically enhanced activity of the complex but rather from a lack of negative regulation by X. Interestingly, two silent mutations were located in close proximity to the X initiation codon in the original mouse-adapted virus (Fig. 2) . These mutations might affect X-protein expression and thereby influence virulence. They may explain why BDV-PK/LRD was more virulent in mice than the virus which appeared in the course of our adaptation experiment. In any case, our results reinforce previous conclusions from experiments with viral minireplicon systems that X negatively regulates viral polymerase activity (14, 22) and further suggest that X serves as a repressor of virulence. It is unclear at present why it is advantageous for BDV to have a negative regulator that restricts its host range. We speculate that negative regulation may favor long-term virus persistence in immune-competent hosts.",

In viral minireplicon assays, mutant L further showed approximately the same activity as wild-type L (Fig. 6B) . These results indicated that either these assays are not suitable for detecting minor variations in polymerase activity or the performance-enhancing effect of the L mutations is not due to increased polymerase activity. It is tempting to speculate that the virulence-enhancing effect of the mutations in L is similar in nature to that of the R66K mutation in P. Viral polymerase complexes containing mutant L might be less susceptible to negative regulation by undefined factors of viral or cellular origin than complexes containing wild-type L. Supporting evidence for this view comes from experiments in which we mixed infected and uninfected cells (Fig. 7) . These experiments indicated that polymerase complexes containing mutant L are hyperactive during the acute phase but not the persistent phase of infection. Altogether, our data demonstrate that replication competence of recombinant BDV strain He/80 FR in a new species is mediated by changes in components of the polymerase complex rather than the viral envelope, and they suggest a role for virus-encoded negative regulator X in this process.",
