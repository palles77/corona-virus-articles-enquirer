The transmembrane subunits from the structurally defined \"class I\" glycoproteins adopt an \u03b1-helical \"trimer-of-hairpins\" conformation during the fusion pathway. Here we present our studies on the envelope glycoprotein transmembrane subunit, GP2, of the CAS virus (CASV). CASV was recently identified from annulated tree boas (Corallus annulatus) with inclusion body disease and is implicated in the disease etiology. We have generated and characterized two protein constructs consisting of the predicted CASV GP2 core domain. The crystal structure of the CASV GP2 post-fusion conformation indicates a trimeric \u03b1-helical bundle that is highly similar to those of Ebola Virus (EBOV) and Marburg Virus (MARV) GP2, despite CASV genome homology to arenaviruses. Denaturation studies demonstrate that the stability of CASV GP2 is pH-dependent with higher stability at lower pH; we propose that this behavior is due to a network of interactions among acidic residues that would destabilize the \u03b1-helical bundle under conditions where the side chains are deprotonated. The pH-dependent stability of the post-fusion structure has been observed in EBOV and MARV GP2, as well as other viruses that enter via the endosome. Infection experiments with CASV and the related Golden Gate Virus (GGV) support a mechanism of entry that requires endosomal acidification. Our results suggest that despite being primarily arenaviruslike, the transmembrane subunit of CASV is extremely similar to the filoviruses.",

Although details of this mechanism vary among viruses, viral glycoproteins typically consist of a surface subunit, which binds to a host cell receptor, and a transmembrane subunit responsible for drawing host and viral membranes together via the formation of a stable post-fusion conformation 2 . The \"class I\" viral fusion proteins, which include those of the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), Influenza, ebolaviruses (exemplified by Ebola Virus (EBOV) and Sudan Virus (SUDV)) and Marburg Virus (MARV), are defined by the formation of a core, trimeric \u03b1-helical bundle by the ectodomain of the transmembrane subunit during membrane fusion 1; 3 . The post-fusion conformations consist of a \"trimer-of-hairpins\" motif in which the ectodomain N-and Cterminal segments are folded back onto one another; this configuration draws the two membranes into proximity and the energy gained from refolding provides the driving force for membrane fusion. Here, we report the crystal structure of the transmembrane subunit, GP2, from the CAS Virus (CASV). CASV was recently isolated from captive boid snakes with inclusion body disease and is a putative causative agent 4 . Although CASV is primarily arenavirus-like, with a similar genomic organization and a homologous nucleoprotein and RNA polymerase, its envelope glycoprotein is more similar to those of EBOV, SUDV, and MARV.",

These are important human pathogens that cause severe hemorrhagic fever associated with high mortality rates 7 . Viral entry has been extensively characterized for EBOV and is mediated by its envelope glycoprotein, GP, which is comprised of trimers of GP1-GP2 heterodimers 8 . Entry is initiated by GP1 binding to cell surface receptors that trigger viral uptake into the endocytic pathway 9; 10 . Within endosomes, GP is cleaved by host cysteine proteases, including cathepsin B and cathepsin L, which cleave GP1 to remove all but a ~17 kDa N-terminal fragment 11 . Interaction of this fragment with the viral receptor Niemann-Pick C1 cholesterol transporter 12; 13; 14 , initiates the fusion reaction, whereby GP2 undergoes a large-scale conformational change resulting in the insertion of a hydrophobic fusion peptide into the host cell membrane. This conformation, where GP2 spans the host and viral membranes, is referred to as the \"extended\" or \"pre-hairpin\" intermediate. Next, the N-terminal and C-terminal heptad repeat regions of GP2 (NHR and CHR, respectively) fold into a thermostable six-helix bundle, or \"trimer-of-hairpins\", promoting membrane fusion by bringing the two membranes into proximity and inducing lipid mixing of the outer leaflets 3; 15 .",

Recently, however, Stenglein et al. identified CASV as well as two other novel arenavirus-like agents in boid snakes with inclusion body disease (IBD) 4 . This condition is characterized symptomatically by neurological abnormalities, regurgitation, and secondary infections and histologically by cellular eosinophilic inclusions 4; 25 . These novel viruses, CASV, the Golden Gate Virus (GGV), and Collierville Virus (CCV) represent the first arenavirus-like viruses to be identified in a reptilian species and suggest that the species tropism of the Arenaviridae family may be much broader than previously thought. Indeed, additional variants of these arenavirus-like viruses have subsequently been identified in boid snakes with IBD in the Netherlands 26 and in Finland 27 , suggesting that such viruses may be present in snakes worldwide.",

It is hypothesized that this feature of the post-fusion \u03b1-helical bundle is reflective of the endosomal mechanism of entry for these viruses; stabilization of conformations required for membrane fusion (e.g. the post-fusion six-helix bundle) is promoted in conditions of appropriate cellular compartments. Similar pH-dependent stability was observed for CASV GP2. Infectivity experiments using CASV and GGV in the presence of chemical inhibitors of endosomal acidification support the hypothesis that endosomal acidification is required for entry.

Based on this sequence comparison, we prepared two protein constructs: one consisting of CASV GP2 residues 254-351 (\"CASV-GP2(254-351)\") and another consisting of residues 267-351 containing an N-terminal fusion to a trimeric variant of GCN4 coiled-coil (\"pII\") (\"pIICASV-GP2(267-351),\"). The shortened CASV segment in pIICASV-GP2(267-351) was predicted based on the boundary of the \u03b1-helical NHR segment in EBOV and MARV GP2 3; 15; 30 . The pII GCN4 coiled-coil contains isoleucine side chains at the core heptad repeat positions (a and d of the canonical abcdefg repeat) that designate preferential homotrimer formation 31; 32 . Chimeras of pII and other trimeric coiledcoils with fragments of class I fusion protein enhances solubility and has facilitated structural studies in the absence of the transmembrane segment in some cases 15; 30 . In both CASV GP2 constructs, the cysteines at positions 270 and 324 were mutated to serine. The corresponding residues in filovirus GP2 form disulfide bonds within the fusion loop (C270) and to the GP1 subunit (C324), both of which were omitted from the core domain construct. Cysteines 315 and 323 were left as native identity, as the corresponding residues form an intramolecular disulfide bond that stabilizes the loop regions of EBOV and MARV GP2 core domains 3; 15; 30 .",

Heptad repeat stutters result from a disruption in the heptad repeat pattern caused by insertion of an additional defg segment (abcdefg defgabc). The stutters in the EBOV and MARV GP2 NHR segment cause a distortion of the NHR \u03b1-helix at the stutter position and a slight local unwinding of the triple-stranded superhelix. For pIICASV-GP2(267-351), the pII segment was engineered to maintain registry of the heptad repeat pattern with the N-terminal segment of the NHR \u03b1-helix, thereby accounting for effects of the stutter on hydrophobic periodicity ( Figure 1) . Notably, heptad stutters are found in a number of viral glycoproteins from both the class I (\u03b1-helical) and class III (mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 structure) categories and have been hypothesized to play a role in viral entry because of this conservation across phylogentically distant species 33 .

We performed two types of experiments to test this hypothesis. First, we quantified virus particle production from infected cells by measuring supernatant viral RNA levels by qRT-PCR ( Figure 5 ). We used CASV as well as the distantly related GGV that was identified along with CASV in annulated tree boas with inclusion body disease to perform these experiments. CASV and GGV share ~50% overall pairwise amino acid identity 4 . Pretreatment of JK cells (derived from boa constrictor) with monensin, a lysosomotropic ionophore, decreased GGV production by ~20-40-fold and CASV production by ~1000fold. Pretreatment with bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar proton pump, had an even more dramatic effect, reducing production of both viruses by approximately 4 logs ( Figure 5A ). We also measured the infectivity of individual GGV particles in a fluorescent-focus assay, which reflects the virus titer and the probability that an individual particle will initiate a productive infection under the experimental conditions ( Figure 5B ). Note that we were unable to perform the fluorescent-focus assay using CASV due to a lack of suitable antibody reagents. Treatment of JK cells with Baf A1 reduced the number of GGV focus forming units (ffu) by ~65-fold ( Figure 5C ). The results of these experiments suggest that an acidic endosomal environment is necessary for efficient infectivity by CASV and GGV.",

Of note, the anion stripes in the CASV and MARV GP2 bundles are located in similar regions, at about the midsection of the NHR core trimer ( Figure 8) . Interestingly, the MARV GP2 anion stripe includes a core d residue, MARV E580, whereas the CASV GP2 anion stripe contains a core a residue, CASV E290. Therefore, the core residues of the CASV GP2 anion stripe are located ~ 1 \u03b1-helical turn closer to the N-terminus of the protein (Figure 8 ). As a result, the E580 in MARV GP2 points almost directly into the core NHR trimer, whereas E290 in CASV GP2 is oriented toward the adjacent NHR \u03b1-helical axis. This contrast in side chain orientation reflects the non-equivalent projection of the C\u03b1-C\u03b2 bond vector relative to the \u03b1helical axis for a and d residues in trimeric coiled-coils 32 . While this difference in a and d positions has a strong influence on coiled-coil topology for hydrophobic residues 31; 32 , it is interesting to note that for electrostatic effects, they have similar functional consequences. While the core acidic residues differ between CASV and MARV GP2, the surface residues of the two anion stripes are located at the same level within the coiled-coils and are nearly superimposable ( Figure 8 ). These features highlight the conservation of this structural mechanism for pH-dependent stability between CASV and MARV GP2.",

By analogy, a stabilizing disulfide bond was predicted to form between CASV C315 and C323; however, no such disulfide bond was observed. Although the side chains of C315 and C323 appear to point towards one another in the crystal structure, the sulfur atoms are separated by 4.96 \u00c5, twice the distance of a disulfide bond ( Figure 6C ). Residue 324, a cysteine in the native GP2 sequence but a serine in our construct, is modeled towards C315. It is therefore possible that a disulfide bond forms in the native protein between C324 and C315. However, this is conjecture only, as the electron density throughout the loop region is poorly defined, and the side chain orientation cannot be definitively assigned. To explore this hypothesis, we generated an additional CASV GP2 construct, pIICASV-GP2(267-351; C323S) that contained the WT cysteine side chain identity at positions 315 and 324, but a cysteine to serine mutation at position 323. We hypothesized that if the native disulfide bond was between C324 and C315, then pIICASVGP2(267-351; C323S) would display higher thermal stability than pIICASV-GP2(267-351). pIICASV-GP2(267-351; C323S) was expressed and purified, and thermal denaturation was performed as described for pIICASV-GP2(267-351). We observed that the T M s for pIICASV-GP2(267-351; C323S) were within error of the T M s for pIICASV-GP2(267-351) ( Figure 4D , Table 1 ). These data suggest either that a disulfide bond is not formed in the C323S construct or that a disulfide bond is formed but does not contribute to an increase in stability of this protein construct.",

These salt bridges are found in two clusters within the structure: five salt bridges are found stabilizing the NHR-CHR bundle portion of the protein, while two salt bridges are found in the membrane proximal half of the bundle. Within the first cluster, salt bridges are observed between E344O\u03b4 and K347N\u03b5, E343O\u03b4 and K346N\u03b5, and D336O\u03b3 and K340N\u03b5 within a monomer (Table 3) . Additional salt bridges are seen between neighboring monomers, consisting of residues E344 and K274 as well as between E351 and K271. The electron density for the lysine residues in these interactions is well defined to the N\u03b5 atom, and the majority of the residues involved in these salt bridges are modeled in single conformations. K274 in chain B was modeled in two conformations, one of which is not optimal for salt bridge formation because of the orientation of its N\u03b5 atom away from E344O\u03b4. However, K274 in chains A and C are modeled in a single conformation with the N\u03b5 atom directed towards E344O\u03b4. D336 is also modeled in a double conformation, only one of which is consistent with salt bridge formation. The second cluster of salt bridges consists of D295 and R294 within the same chain and D328 and K288 of neighboring chains. The electron density for these residues is all well defined and modeled in a single conformation. Several possible salt bridges were identified in the EBOV and MARV GP2 structures, although salt bridge formation does not appear to be a major mechanism of stabilization for filovirus GP2 3; 15; 30 . Interestingly, four stabilizing salt bridges per chain were observed in the LCMV GP2 structure, and mutational studies have shown that these salt bridges seem to play an important role in the stabilization of most arenavirus GP2s 33 .",

Our results are consistent with phylogenetic predictions that CASV GP2 resembles GP2 from EBOV and MARV, with a homologous overall backbone fold and an analogous pattern of pH-dependent thermostability. We confirmed the presence of a heptad repeat stutter in the coiled-coil region of the CASV GP2 sequence, at position T279. Such stutters have been observed in numerous class I and class III viral fusion proteins, notably in viruses that infect host cells through the endocytic pathway 33 .

These residues are surface exposed and result in significant negative electrostatic surface potential in this portion of the bundle with a solvation energy of \u22127175 kcal/mol, indicating that the surface of this protein is highly charged (Figure 9 ).

ASLV enters cells using an unusual 2-step mechanism that has both pH-independent and pH-dependent features. Receptor binding and exposure of the fusion loop occur at neutral pH; however, viral reverse transcripts are not detected in cells treated with bafilomycin, suggesting that endosomal pH is required for infection 42 . Aydin et al. found that the ASLV TM bundle was equally stable at low and neutral pH, with only small differences in T M , over a range of pH 5.0 to 8.5 41 . This behavior contrasts with the marked pH-dependent stability of the EBOV, MARV, and CASV GP2 post-fusion \u03b1-helical bundles. Mutational studies on ASLV TM suggest that two histidine residues (H490 and H492) in the chain reversal region confer stability at low pH either by direct electrostatic interaction with a neighboring acidic residue (H492 and D496) or by overall stabilization of a putative helical dipole at the membrane-distal end of the core NHR trimer.

            "text": "To compare the overall backbone folds of CASV GP2 to other viral glycoprotein fusion subunits, we examined the global backbone RMSDs of the ectodomain segments using the SuperPose server 43 . The pII (GCN4) segments for pII-GP fusions were omitted from the RMSD calculation. The overall backbone conformation of the CASV GP2 trimer is extremely similar to the backbone from both MARV and EBOV GP2 (RMSD = 0.69 \u00c5 with MARV and 0.75 \u00c5 with EBOV (PDB ID 2EBO) ( Figure 10 ). This striking similarity is somewhat surprising, given that the sequences share <26% identity ( Table 4 ). The backbone conformation of CASV GP2 also displays marked similarity to the fusion protein from MoMLV, a retrovirus that causes cancer in some murine hosts. The structure that is available for the MoMLV fusion protein (TM) is truncated before the CHR \u03b1-helical segments 34 ; however, the trimeric NHR coiled-coil core of MoMLV aligns well with the CASV GP2 helical core (RMSD = 0.50 \u00c5) with particular similarity observed in the membrane proximal half of the bundle, including the loop region ( Figure 10 ). The CASV, MARV, and EBOV GP2 structures all contained the pII (GCN4) trimerization motif. Although this segment was not included in the alignment, it should nonetheless be considered whether it is in part responsible for the similarity among these three GP2s. None of the pII fusion structures contain long-range interactions between GP2 segments and pII. Furthermore, two structures of EBOV GP2 exist, one containing the pII fusion and one without, and the EBOV GP2 segments are in strong agreement with one another and both the MARV and CASV segments 3; 15; 30 . Therefore, these structures likely represent the native GP2 post-fusion conformation.",

The packing of the CHR segments relative to the NHR core trimers differs dramatically, and the loop region connecting the NHR and CHR segments is significantly different. Nonetheless, despite the low sequence homology (13%, Table 4 ) and poor global structural alignment, the architecture of CASV GP2 does share some similar features with LCMV GP2. Both structures contain a long core NHR trimer including a heptad repeat stutter at similar locations ( Figure S1 ), an overall the trimer-of-hairpins motif containing shorter CHR segments, and the presence of many potential salt bridges. Additionally, the CASV GP2 and EBOV/MARV GP2 bundles display features that are remarkably similar to those in the fusion proteins of other unrelated viruses, such as the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) GP21 and SARS coronavirus S2 44; 45 .

            "text": "It has been previously hypothesized that arenavirus and filovirus glycoproteins arose from a common RNA virus ancestor because of similarities in the overall structure and amino terminal residues 46 . The evolutionary origin of the CASV family of viruses remains unknown, but the similarity of CASV GP2 with EBOV and MARV GP2 raises the interesting possibility that these viruses, or at least these glycoprotein genes, do indeed share a common ancestor. It is striking that the mechanism for pH-dependence is similar for both CASV and MARV GP2, involving an anion stripe, but that the locations of participating residues are not identical. Thus, the specific interactions giving rise to pH-dependent behavior in these two cases may have resulted from independent co-evolution or may be the result of a single, common ancestor. Either way, the results presented here demonstrate the GP2 structural architecture and pH-dependent stability of the post-fusion state are critical to function across multiple viruses.",
