Risk for COVID-19 exposure remains relatively low in South America and Africa. If adequate measures are taken, including on-site disease detection and temporary passenger quarantine, limited but not terminated air traffic can be a feasible option to prevent a long-term crisis. Reasonable risk calculations and case evaluations per passenger volume are crucial aspects which must be considered when reducing international flights.",

The latest available data on the international passenger number are from 2018 and estimated at 63 million. While air traffic is the predominant form of international passenger traffic with China, it has a lower share on domestic routes than other forms of transport e.g. car, bus and train. The rail system alone carried 2.357 billion passengers in 2014. Domestic air traffic and COVID-19 cases According to the data from the CAAC in 2018, air traffic in China is mostly attributable to the eastern part of the country with 53.2% in the east, 29.4% in the west, 6.3% in the northeast and 11.1% in the central region. Although the number of domestic flight passengers exceeds international flight passengers, trains and cars are the predominant form of travel in Chinese provinces and regions. Domestic COVID-19 cases outside of the central region exceed international COVID-19 cases by far. Analyses of domestic flights show an inhomogeneous passenger distribution within China (figure 1). Analysis of the total number of COVID-19 cases of regions shows a correlation with the current passenger volume (figure 2). International air traffic Cases worldwide and corresponding air traffic level The global distribution of COVID-19 cases occurs particularly in Asia, where also most of the flight routes are destined to. This is followed by Europe and North America with comparable route numbers (figure 3). While in North America, the flight destinations are concentrated on fewer countries (USA and Canada) and fewer international airports, the number of countries and destinations affected in Europe is much higher. The direct comparison of international passengers and COVID-19 cases shows a significant correlation with a clear trend on Asian countries which have the most flight routes with China (figure 4). Accordingly, Europe, North America and the Southwest Pacific have lower numbers, while in Africa and South America, with a negligible percentage of flight routes, there are no initial cases. A statistical analysis of international cases shows a statistically significant pattern between the high-volume air traffic region Asia and the lowtraffic region Europe (figure 4). No such significant correlation is found in the United States, where the case numbers remain relatively low, and in the Southwest Pacific, where only Australia is affected.",

In addition, compared to the Ebola virus, which mainly occurred in rural and sparsely populated areas, COVID-19 has developed in the country with the highest global population density. Thus, air traffic has been a main vector for the global spread of COVID-19. While our data is incomplete due to only limited availability of information, our findings suggest a direct correlation between passenger numbers between mainland China and international destinations and diagnosed COVID-19 cases outside of China. The big differences in COVID-19 cases numbers per passenger in China vs.internationally are most likely related to extensive domestic transportation by train and car whereas international COVID-19 spread is practically solely attributable to air traffic and passenger numbers. International traffic with China mainly depends on the air traffic network, since mainland China is geographically relatively isolated from other world centers, even within Asia. Our analyzed data further indicate that international cases cannot be viewed as individual events. The number of international cases is directly correlated to the number of air traffic routes and passenger volume, which is a troublesome finding.",

Despite the unwavering international interest on this public health crisis, information on biology and transmission of this virus are limited and final mortality rates are subject to only rough estimation 1-3 . Interestingly, there are varying approaches in different countries on how to best avoid further COVID-19 exposure from outside. While new data is acquired amid these discussions, some countries have restricted travel to regions with high amounts of COVID-19 cases. So far, a wide range of distinct operational procedures and measures have been implemented with respect to air traffic. While some countries have completely shut down border crossings and restricted flights in affected areas 4 , others have implemented fever measurements and 2-week long self-quarantine for travelers to contain further spread of COVID-19 cases. Since the extent of COVID-19 cases vary enormously between different countries, ranging from very high numbers to none or only a few cases, making decisions on if and how to restrict air traffic from heavily affected countries remains challenging.

While our data supports this development, we must critically reevaluate air traffic restrictions and whether their continuous use is effective with respect to increasing global COVID-19 cases.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from thecorresponding author on reasonable request HL: data acquisition, data interpretation, final analysis, drafting of the manuscript, final approval for publication VK: data acquisition, analysis and interpretation, drafting of the manuscript, final approval for publication PK: data interpretation, drafting of the manuscript, final approval for publication AM: data interpretation, drafting of the manuscript, final approval for publication HI: data interpretation, drafting of the manuscript, statistical analyses MZ: data interpretation, drafting of the manuscript, final approval for publication JB: data interpretation, critical revision for important intellectual content, final approval for publication TK: data interpretation, conception and design of the work, critical revision for important intellectual content, final approval for publication",
