Therefore, mixed disorders might be concealed within a modest deviation of HCO \u2212 3 that belies the true severity of a metabolic disorder. A paucity of data exists regarding the role of UA in veterinary medicine. UA are associated with a lethargic demeanor in calves, 10 but studies in dogs are scarce. In humans there is a relationship between an increased strong ion gap (SIG) and elevated inflammatory cytokines, 11 but this has not been shown in veterinary patients. Increased UA correlates with death in humans [12] [13] [14] but in 1 retrospective study in dogs none of the acid-base perturbations, including elevated UA, were considered to confer a prognostic advantage. 15 The purpose of the present study was to describe the acid-base changes in PE using both the HH and SIM models, and to compare and contrast the findings.",

The sum of effects (SOE) was subtracted from the base excess (BE) in order to determine the presence of UA. Each of the effects was correlated with pH and the SOE to assess the relationship of each metabolic component with the overall acid-base changes. The number of dogs with changes in each of the aforementioned categories was quantified. To reach a final diagnosis, the chloride, sodium, and lactate effect were evaluated for changes in SID (alkalosis/ acidosis), and the albumin and phosphate effect were summated to yield the A tot .

Accordingly, the authors employed a model using experimentally validated data. 19 Briefly, the strong ion difference was calculated as shown in Table 3 , and the A tot was calculated using both albumin and total protein for comparison, because of the fact that globulins have been shown to contribute to the A tot to a greater extent than is seen in humans. 19 Lastly, the SIG was calculated to detect the presence of UA for comparison, with the UA as determined by the FS approach. Four calculations for SIG were used for comparison, based on equations developed for use in canine plasma. 19 It has been previously shown that there are significant differences between SIG when it is calculated using different equations. 22 The data generated in the PE group were compared to the control dog data to arrive at an acid-base diagnosis ( Table 2 ). Using this model the following acid-base diagnoses could be reached based on whether SID, A tot , and SIG were increased/decreased according to Table 3 ; SID acidosis/alkalosis, A tot acidosis/alkalosis, and the presence of UA acidosis as evidenced by an increase in the SIG. For the purposes of diagnostic comparison the SIG calculated from total protein was used, which factors a correction for pH into the equation. 19 Both equations for SID (SID3 and SID4) were used to diagnose changes in SID. If 1 of the SID equations were abnormal a SID disorder was diagnosed. These data were displayed using Venn diagrams with the SIG representing the SIG calculated using total protein with a correction for pH. Furthermore, the delta chloride (\u0394chloride) and sodium (\u0394sodium) were calculated, because of the fact that we suspected that concurrent changes in sodium and chloride would be present, which would potentially neutralize the SID 3 and SID 4 . This was calculated by subtracting the PE dogs' serum sodium and chloride from the normal value derived from our control population (Table 2 ). Changes greater than 2 SDs from the median were considered clinically important.",

Clinicians remain divided as to the advantage of 1 acid-base paradigm over the other, and thus the great trans-Atlantic acid-base debate 24,25 remains unresolved. Some researchers have suggested that the approaches are essentially the same, but are premised on different epistemological principles. 26, 27 Many clinicians find acid-base physiology an arcane field with no clear consensus as to how it should be interpreted and which model should be used. Moreover, acid-base physiology is still conjectural, based largely on mathematical models, predicated on differing physicochemical hypotheses. 26 However, assuming the veracity of the SIM paradigm we demonstrated a clear advantage of the SIM over HH in explaining complex mixed metabolic acid-base perturbations in PE. We specifically chose PE as a disease model, due the diversity of expected perturbations to acid-base homeostasis, which we suspected would have concomitant acidifying and alkalinizing effects, given the fact that diarrhea is often associated with acidemia, 10,28 and vomiting with alkalemia. 29, 30 Based on previous work 5 we anticipated changes in SID and A tot would be present, but we did not anticipate the presence of UA in severe acidemia as was documented in this study. In accordance with a previous study, using the FS, chloride was the most strongly associated with the SOE (P < .001; rho 0.79) but it was not significantly correlated with blood pH (Figure 3 ). These results infer the importance of chloride in the changes of the metabolic compartment according to the FS approach, but the lack of association with pH suggested that it was part of a complex and mixed process. Conversely, UA and free water were significantly correlated with blood pH (P = 0.03; rho 0.4 and P = .002; rho: \u22120.46 respectively). Interestingly, hyponatremia has been associated with acidemia in calves with diarrhea 23 but not in dogs. In this study, free-water acidosis was present in 22/42 cases ( Figure 2 ). However, in 13/22 cases a concurrent hypochloremic alkalosis was also present, which would have a neutralizing effect on blood pH.",

When the \u0394chloride and \u0394sodium were evaluated in dogs with normal SID (as calculated by the VDM), we were able to identify all of the cases that were judged to be abnormal according to the FS approach. We propose that when the VDM is used, clinicians are cognizant of neutralizing SID effects, and pay attention to the individual contributors of the SID when calculating this. We also propose that the VDM's diagnostic utility could be augmented by calculating the \u0394sodium and \u0394chloride in cases where concurrent changes might be present such as in PE. When UA were calculated using the FS approach and VDM equations, 11 cases were identified by the FS approach and the SIG alb . The SIG alb-simplified identified 13 cases with increases in UA, and the SIG tp identified the fewest, with 5 cases judged to have increased UA. These results confirm the findings and conclusions of a previous study in healthy dogs 20 that showed significant differences between SIG calculated using different equations, and emphasize the importance of using equations that have been validated for use in dogs. Further studies are necessary to determine which of these equations for SIG is the most appropriate to use in dogs in various disease processes. The fact that the VDM showed that an A tot acidosis was the most common change further emphasized the need to use a standardized approach with species-specific data validation, as these were likely underestimated by the FS approach which is derived from human data. According to the HH model, metabolic changes were common, which would be expected given the severe biochemical insults associated with vomiting, diarrhea, and sepsis. Interestingly, in many of these cases, the bicarbonate was inappropriately normal (based on pH and CO 2 ), or modestly changed, which would be expected in cases where concurrent acidotic and alkalotic processes are present. Our findings are further supported by a study in critically ill human patients, with normal HH acid-base findings, in which the SIM unmasked profound mixed metabolic effects which were neutralizing. 31 Blood lactate was not associated with acidemic pH in PE in contrast to the findings of a previous study. 8 The HH model also detected fewer cases with acid-base abnormalities than did the FS approach, but more cases than the VDM did (if \u0394sodium and \u0394chloride were ignored). This might be because of the fact that the FS approach is too sensitive.",

In particular UA, which are calculated using the base excess, which is derived from the Van Slyke equation 21, 37 and nomograms that were developed from studies using human blood. It was assumed that the nomograms would be the same for other species, but it has been shown that the canine nomogram differs from that of humans. 20 It could be argued that based on this previous study the BE in other species 38 might provide inaccurate results. While it was not within the scope of this study to validate the FS model, we felt that by deriving our cutoffs for UA according to the FS from our control dogs that we somewhat overcame this limitation, as we would have expected that these mathematical variations would have been present in both groups, but we cannot be certain of this. The differences in BE estimation because of differences in dog blood or anticoagulant used are unlikely to be of clinical relevance within the physiological pH range. 20, 39 Interestingly, as could be expected, we found that when control dog data were used in the BE calculation, there were significant differences between the BE and BE corrected for the PE group that was less negative than the BE (using standard formulae) group (less acidic). This is consistent with previous findings, 20 where dog blood was shown to be slightly acidic according to the BE nomogram at pH 7.4, but our results also seem to confirm that this is unlikely to be of clinical importance. Notwithstanding this finding, we feel this study emphasizes the importance of developing and using validated methodologies and species specific reference data for comparison. In particular, the impact of protein on the BE calculation might be of significance given the species differences in plasma proteins. 38 The authors found that by virtue of the number of variables considered, the FS provided more information and in individual cases we felt provided greater pathophysiological clarity. However, the FS was by far the most cumbersome, time consuming, and required a deeper understanding of acid-base physiology to apply. The VDM was the easiest model to apply and understand. The HH model can be challenging to interpret in complex disorders, especially for novice clinicians as acid-base disease can be present in the face of normal HH values. Therefore, we believe that further work is needed to assess the clinical utility of the VDM in other disease models. Future studies should also focus to ascertain if there is any therapeutic or prognostic advantage in using the SIM in dogs. Of great interest would be to determine if in the population of HH \"normal\" dogs identified with SIM acid-base abnormalities, whether a SIM approach might serve as an early warning of impending homeostatic decompensation. We device for blood gas analysis in veterinary medicine, bench top analyzers, that are used in reference laboratories, with daily quality controls and calibration that are used by trained laboratory personnel are likely to provide more consistent results than point-of-care analyzers. 44, 45 Therefore, our data were collected and processed by a single experienced operator, using a bench top blood gas analyzer. A second limitation was the relatively small control dog size for data comparison. Establishment of a reference interval for this study with confidence levels would have been ideal. Reference intervals have already been established for dogs 19, 46 and so the purpose of our control group was to ensure that the healthy dogs were within the limits of normal published values, and that our control dog data did not differ significantly from published ranges.",

The etiology of this finding is not clear in the current study, as there was no evidence of lung pathology based on clinical evaluation of the PE puppies, and the respiratory rates were not statistically significantly different from the control group (data not shown). The authors postulated that general weakness and hypermetabolic states 34 (because of sepsis and fever) might have contributed to the development of respiratory acidosis. Furthermore, deviations in CO 2 were not attributable to metabolic perturbations, because they were not in the range consonant with respiratory compensation inferring a true primary disorder in this compartment. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms involved in respiratory acidosis, in nonrespiratory/nonneurological diseases and to ascertain if any therapeutic or prognostic insights can be derived from these findings.The preponderance of elevated UA in severe acidemia in PE was an interesting finding that warrants further investigation. Elevated UA were the most common metabolic abnormality in severe acidemia according to the both the SIM models used. Consequently, this study provides further support for the utility of SIMs in the classification of acid-base disorders, particularly because the AG (traditionally used as part of a HH assessment) failed to demonstrate an increase in UA in our study.",
