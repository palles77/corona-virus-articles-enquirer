            "text": "The inflammatory response in the liver is unusual for three main reasons. First, hepatic microvasculature is structurally and functionally different from tissues with capillary vasculature. Microvascular permeability to plasma proteins, a hallmark of acute inflammation in most tissues, is a normal property of the fenestrated sinusoidal endothelium of the liver. Thus, edema is not a prominent feature of acute parenchymal inflammation, although it can be observed in the capsule, biliary tracts, and gallbladder. Microvascular blood flow in hepatic sinusoids is also less responsive to the actions of various vasoactive mediators that alter blood flow in most other acutely inflamed tissues. Second, hepatic Kupffer cells have some distinctive properties that enable them to deal with many potentially inflammatory insults in the portal circulation.While they appear to have a higher threshold for activation, they can release large amounts of potent mediators such as nitric oxide, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-oL that can influence cell populations in the liver and elsewhere. Third, the liver has central regulatory influences on many proinflammatory insults and inflammatory mediators. The liver produces most plasma proteins with anti-inflammatory functions, and is also the site of degradation of most soluble plasma proteins. Kupffer cells are the main site of clearance of immune complexes from the circulation, and they have an important role in the development of immunotolerance to potential antigenic substances absorbed from the intestine.",

Ongoing cell death and repair can appear inflammatory and acute leukocyte responses can cause necrosis and apoptosis in the liver. The term \"necroinflammatory\" is convenient when the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms of necrosis and inflammation are unknown. Areas of focal hepatitis are commonly found in the liver, particularly in older animals. These usually reflect previous areas of focal infection or necrosis that are of little functional significance because the liver has so much functional reserve and regenerative capacity.",

These changes can be diagnostically useful but they do not constitute evidence of hepatitis unless there is obvious infiltration of granulocytes, monocytes, or lymphocytes into the perisinusoidal space. Extramedullary hematopoiesis can also appear as focal aggregates of myeloid cells in the perisinusoidal compartment. These changes (sometimes termed myeloid metaplasia) can be distinguished from inflammatory infiltrates by the presence of immature myeloid cells. Occasionally, hematopoietic cells from the splenic red pulp can be artifactually extruded into the portal vasculature and appear in the liver, usually as nucleated cell aggregates in the larger portal veins.",

Cholangiohepatitis applies to hepatic inflammation centered on the biliary tract and extending into adjacent hepatic parenchyma. The term hepatitis is used for focal or diffuse hepatic conditions that are either caused by infectious agents or characterized by a leukocytic infiltrative inflammatory response, irrespective of the cause. This definition allows us to include viral infections that are hepatotropic, even though the lesions are mainly characterized by hepatocellular necrosis or apoptosis rather than by the inflammatory response to the agent. Demonstration of sufficient amounts of injurious infectious agents within the lesions by inclusion bodies, antigens, or nucleic acids are important in making this diagnosis.The term hepatitis is also used for responses to some hepatic toxicants, metals, or drug metabolic idiosyncrasies in which there is a prominent leukocytic response to damaged cells. However, in responses in which single necrotic hepatocytes elicit a mild neutrophilic or histiocytic response, the term hepatitis is less appropriate because the pattern of injury is primarily degenerative.",

By comparison, most infectious causes of hepatitis, for example toxoplasmosis, various herpesviruses, and various bacteria, produce a more patchy pattern of inflammation with focally intense leukocyte and Kupffer cell responses in the vicinity of areas of necrosis.The distribution, character, and chronicity of these focal lesions are important diagnostically, but they typically do not damage enough functional hepatic parenchyma, ducts, or vasculature to produce systemic signs of liver failure.

Systems for grading and staging chronic hepatitis have been developed (Tables 2.1 and 2.2). More detailed histological activity index scoring systems have also been developed. In human medicine, chronic hepatitis is usually the result of chronic infection with hepatotropic viruses, and, less commonly, autoimmune, drug-induced or associated with inherited metabolic diseases such as Wilson disease. In veterinary medicine, chronic liver disease may develop following chronic bile duct obstruction, infection with hepatotropic infectious agents, familial or hereditary metabolic diseases, or may be toxic, drug-induced, or possibly autoimmune in origin. However, the majority of chronic liver disease is idiopathic, reflecting deficiencies in our current level of understanding of the etiological, pathophysiological, and clinical implications of the patterns of inflammation and necrosis seen in domestic animals. Regardless of the etiology, initial acute liver damage will not progress to fibrosis or cirrhosis unless the inflammation and damage are protracted, for example, by ongoing hepatocellular injury mediated by immunological mechanisms, including antibody-and lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity, or ongoing oxidative damage. Clinical signs are nonspecific in the early stages, but as the disease progresses to involve more of the liver and impair regeneration, icterus, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy may develop as typical correlates with hepatic insufficiency.",

The first is periportal interface hepatitis, sometimes referred to as \"piecemeal necrosis\" (Fig.   2 .43). Tkis necroinflammatory change initially destroys the limiting plate of periportal hepatocytes, and may continue to erode into the hepatic parenchyma, expanding the portal areas. Portal inflammation is variable in intensity, and includes infiltration by lymphocytes and plasma cells. Bridging necrosis, with tracts of necrosis dissecting across the hepatic lobule between portal triads or between portal areas and central veins, may also develop. Degenerative changes affecting hepatocytes in areas of interface hepatitis include cell swelling and apoptosis. Bile duct degeneration, multifocal necrosis, and hepatocellular regeneration in the form of increased numbers of binucleated and trinucleated cells and mitotic figures, may also be seen.

While infectious etiologies, and drug-and toxin-induced chronic hepatic disease have been described, the majority remains idiopathic, although some appear to be breed-associated or familial. Breeds of dogs reported to be at increased risk for chronic hepatitis include the Bedlington Terrier, West Highland White Terrier, Doberman Pinscher, American and English Cocker Spaniel, Skye Terrier, Labrador Retriever, and Standard Poodle.Apart from the hereditary hepatic copper accumulation in Bedlington Terriers, the etiology of the breed-related disorders remains unclear. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of chronic hepatitis in dogs are poorly understood. Given the importance of autoimmune hepatitis in human medicine, several studies have evaluated the role of immune mechanisms in dogs. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation in response to liver membrane antigens was higher in dogs with chronic hepatitis, supporting the hypothesis of an immunemediated process, although whether this is primary or secondary to hepatocyte destruction is not known. An irmnunohistochemical study of the inflammatory infiltrate in 16 dogs with chronic hepatitis identified CD3 + lymphocytes as the most numerous lymphoid cells in liver sections from affected animals. Degenerate hepatocytes were occasionally surrounded by these cells, and necrosis was positively correlated with the numbers of CD3+ lymphocytes, suggesting a role for an immune-mediated process in chronic hepatitis.The number of or-smooth-muscle actin-positive cells (periductular myofibroblasts and activated perisinusoidal stellate cells) in portal triads and fibrous septa was positively correlated with the stage of fibrosis, lending support to the role of these cells in fibrogenesis in the canine liver. Upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class II antigen expression in hepatocytes has been demonstrated in Doberman hepatitis in association with lymphocyte infiltration, and it has been suggested that hepatocytes presenting a putative major histocompatibility complex class II molecule-associated autoantigen could be targets for T-cell-mediated immune attack. However, a primary autoimmune pathogenesis has yet to be demonstrated.",

Hepatic copper accumulation may result from a primary metabolic defect in hepatic copper metabolism, or possibly as a secondary event resulting from abnormal hepatic function, cholestasis, and altered biliary excretion, a mechanism described in the human literature but not conclusively demonstrated in dogs. A hereditary, autosomal recessive copper-associated hepatopathy associated with impaired biliary copper excretion and progressive accumulation of copper within hepatocytes has been well documented in Bedlington Terriers, and postulated in other breeds, including West Highland White Terriers and Skye Terriers. The chromosomal locus of the gene in affected Bedlingtons has been mapped and a mutation in the MURR1 gene identified, while other defects in the canine homologs of human genes for the copper-transporting ATPase, ATP7B, defective in Wilson disease in humans, and ATOX1, the copper chaperone delivering copper to ATP7B, have been excluded as possible candidates.While its function is unknown, the protein Murrl has been shown to interact with the copper transporter ATP7B, and may be a copper chaperone involved in directing copper to biliary excretion.The human MURR 1 gene is also polymorphic and one mutation is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of Wilson disease in a minority of human patients.",

Regardless of the reasons for copper accumulation, lysosomal copper can exceed a threshold or be released when hepatocytes die, and thereby contribute to the development of hepatitis.

Affected Bedlingtons are usually presented with signs of progressive liver failure, including ill-thrift, wasting, ascites, and signs of encephalopathy.

Histologic changes in the livers of dogs exhibiting clinical signs of advanced hepatic disease include piecemeal necrosis ofperiportal zone 1 hepatocytes, with a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate, as well as necrosis of zone 3 hepatocytes with bridging necrosis crossing the lobule.Various degrees of portal fibrosis develop, with bile duct proliferation, bridging fibrosis, and development of cirrhosis in the most severely affected dogs (Fig. 2.45 ).Accumulation of copper in periportal zone 1 hepatocytes, particularly in areas of degeneration and necrosis, is prominent, although central hepatocytes also have some copper-positive granules (Fig. 2.46 ). Intrahepatocyte bile pigment accumulation and intracanalicular bile stasis are present in periportal zones, along with iron accumulation in Kupffer cells and macrophages. Two recent studies, however, document that piecemeal necrosis and marked periportal inflammation are not prominent lesions in early stages of hepatic disease in Dobermans. One retrospective histologic study of the lesions in the livers of 35 Dobermans in the early precirrhotic stages of the disease found a consistently different pattern, with progressive fibrosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte loss beginning in zone 3, affecting hepatocytes around the terminal hepatic vein branches.The earliest changes were inflammation, predominantly small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and individual or clusters of pigmented macrophages often containing iron or copper, collagen deposition around the small hepatic vein branches, and apoptosis of scattered hepatocytes in zone 3. Copper-containing cells were exclusively in zone 3 hepatocytes, contrary to previously published reports. As the disease progressed, collagen deposition increased around the hepatic veins. In some specimens, thin fibrous septa radiated from the hepatic vein branches. In a few dogs, lymphoplasmacytic inflammation was mild and restricted to the connective tissue surrounding smaller branches of the hepatic vein. In the majority of cases, inflammation was distributed equally to the connective tissue around hepatic veins and the connective tissue of the portal tracts. In the most severe cases, infiltrating inflammatory cells were also present in the parenchyma among the hepatocytes. The sinusoids adjacent to the areas of fibrosis were converted to endothelial-lined, thin-walled vessels. Histologic changes were the same regardless of hepatic copper concentration, which appeared to be incidental to the disease progression. The second study of the histologic hepatic lesions in 18 Dobermans suffering from subclinical hepatitis reported that the most significant changes in biopsy samples were multifocal clusters of inflammatory cells in the parenchyma, and portal inflammation. Inflammatory cells were mainly lymphocytes, but neutrophils and macrophages also appeared. Numbers of plasma cells were low. Periportal piecemeal necrosis was usually mild or moderate, and the limiting plate surrounding the portal area was never markedly ruptured. Three dogs had minimal bridging necrosis. Expansion of the portal area, fibrosis, and bile duct proliferation were uncommon, and, if present, mild. Every subclinically affected dog had excessive copper staining in its liver. Five dogs later euthanized for reasons other than liver disease showed progression of hepatic lesions, with at least moderate piecemeal necrosis, and moderate to marked portal expansion. Four dogs were later euthanized because of progressive hepatic disease.All had moderate to marked piecemeal and bridging necrosis, moderate to marked portal expansion, bile duct proliferation, and fibrosis.",

Clinical illness directly attributable to copper hepatotoxicity (concentrations >2000 Ixg/g dry weight) in West Highland White Terriers is, however, apparently uncommon. Idiopathic chronic hepatitis progressing to cirrhosis does also occur in this breed, and may be distinguished on the basis of a different zonal location and morphology of the inflammatory lesions. In the idiopathic disease, inflammatory loci are smaller, composed of a single apoptotic hepatocyte or fragments of cells accompanied by a few lymphocytes and plasma cells, and are commonly localized to zone 1, or may be random in distribution. In dogs with copper toxicosis, loci of inflammation and necrosis were larger, always found around the central vein among copper-laden hepatocytes, and were composed of debris-filled macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and scattered neutrophils, with occasional apoptotic hepatocytes around the periphery.

Various injectable biologics of equine origin have been associated with the disease, including Clostridium pe~ingens toxoids, tetanus antitoxin, and equine herpesviral vaccines prepared from equine fetal tissue and pregnant mare serum. However, while such an association holds for the majority of cases, there are many, usually sporadic, cases in horses that have not received any injections.

The occurrence of equine serum hepatitis among inoculated animals is variable and attempts to reproduce the disease by experimental transmission have rarely been successful.

The acute stage is characterized by edema and neutrophilic portal infiltrates, inflammation and degeneration of bile ducts with neutrophils in ductular lumens and emigrating through the ductular epithelium, infiltration of inflammatory cells into hepatic lobules and periportal hepatocellular necrosis. Mixed cholangiohepatitis, with neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells infiltrating portal areas accompanied by bile duct proliferation, biliary epithelial degeneration, and various degrees ofperiportal to bridging fibrosis, may represent the subacute stage (Fig. 2.50) , while concentric periportal fibrosis and pseudolobule formation may represent the most chronic stage of the disease. Suppurative cholangiohepatitis is more prevalent in cats 11-15 years of age, and often occurs in conjunction with other disorders, including acute extrahepatic bile duct obstruction, pancreatitis, or inflammatory bowel disease. This condition has been suggested to be the result of acute inflammation in the biliary tree associated with ascending bacterial infection. In the cat, the biliary and pancreatic ducts have a common entry to the duodenum, and simultaneous infectious inflammation of these systems is common. Escherichia coli is the most common bacterial isolate; however, Bacteroides, hemolytic Streptococcus, and clostridia have also been reported. An apparently distinct condition of cats, lymphocytic portal hepatitis is characterized by lymphocytic or lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates confined to the portal area, with no evidence of periportal necrosis or invasion of adjacent hepatic Iobules (Fig. 2.51A ). Bile duct proliferation is present, but there is no evidence of bile duct epithelial degeneration or cholangitis. Periportal fibrosis is typically present, but there is no bridging between portal areas and central veins. The condition is seen most often in cats over 15 years of age, and is slowly progressive, but does not result in pseudolobule formation. Lymphocytic portal hepatitis differs from descriptions of feline progressive lymphocytic cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis, which has been suggested by some authors to be part of the chronic phase of neutrophilic cholangiohepatitis, as described above (Fig. 2.51B ). However, progressive lymphocytic cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis has been reported predominantly in younger cats, is not apparently associated with concurrent intestinal or pancreatic disease, and is postulated to have an immune-mediated pathogenesis.This condition is typified by lymphocytic inflammation of portal tracts, with infiltration of bile ducts, extension into periportal hepatic parenchyma, bile duct proliferation accompanied by small foci of neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, and fibrosis.",

Calcium bilirubinate calculi have been reported in the bile ducts of horses ( Fig. 2.53) , associated with intermittent jaundice.",

Tumors of the pancreas and duodenum, and tumors and abscesses of the hilus of the liver and portal nodes, may cause compression stenosis of the ducts. Edematous swelling of the papilla in enteritis may also be of significance. Biliary obstruction by abnormal intraluminal mucoid secretion (gallbladder mucocele) has been reported in dogs (see section on Ectopic, metaplastic, and hyperplastic lesions, below).",

Increases in serum ~/-glutamyltranspeptidase and alkaline phosphatase usually occur when a sufficiently large amount of the duct system is affected. The ducts undergo progressive cylindric dilation, which may be extreme. The smallest interlobular ducts and the cholangioles proliferate. There is inflammation in the walls of the ducts and the portal triads, and this is probably due in part to chemical irritation by bile acids but is largely due to secondary bacterial infections.These infections may be acute and purulent, or low-grade; in these cases, bacteria may not be easily cultured. The cholangiohepatitis that almost inevitably follows has been described earlier.",
