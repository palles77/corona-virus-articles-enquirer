Given these similarities, this article compares and contrasts the actors, relationships, and norms at work in cyber intelligence and disease surveillance. Historical analysis reveals that civilian cyber defense is more decentralized, private, and voluntary than public health in the United States. Most of these differences are due to political choices rather than technical necessities. In particular, political resistance to government institutions has shaped cyber intelligence over the past 30 years, which is a troubling sign for attempts to improve disease surveillance through local, state, and federal health departments. Information sharing about malware is also limited, despite information technology being integral to cyberspace. Such limits suggest that automation through electronic health records will not automatically improve public health surveillance. Still, certain aspects of information sharing and analysis for cyber defense are worth emulating or, at the very least, learning from to help detect and manage health threats.",

The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of health information are vital to this profession and threatened by security challenges ranging from medical data breaches to ransomware targeting hospitals. Of course, it is important to note that malicious software and infectious diseases are not the same. Malware is computer code processed by digital electronics, whereas diseases and their hosts are biological organisms. Malware is not lethal, while infectious diseases kill millions of people each year. Usually, malware is created with malicious intent (as its name implies), but the vast majority of infectious diseases are naturally occurring and lack hostile motives (with the rare exception of biological weapons). 10 Nevertheless, these threats are similar in several ways that are significant for security. First and foremost, both malware and infectious disease can be contagious and widely spread. Transmissibility varies: Not all cyber attacks are broadcast or intended to spread beyond a specific computer, and not all infectious diseases are contagious. Yet, the potential for spread means that the threat to any individual or computer depends in part on the health of the overall population or network. This interdependence also means that securing either kind of system through intelligence or surveillance depends in part on local, national, and international cooperation.",

For example, antivirus companies now share malware samples to improve detection, and the vaccine industry has long benefited from the virus samples shared through the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). 13, 14 Both the advantages of cooperation and difficulties of detection are compounded by the variety of malware and disease. New pathogens are always emerging (eg, through antigenic drift and shift in influenza). New malware is also common. According to Symantec, ''there were more than 317 million new pieces of malware created'' in 2014, ''meaning nearly one million new threats were released into the wild each day.'' 15(p7) Finally, some of the specialized knowledge and tools used to detect and treat malware and disease are dual use. This means that they can be used for both benefit and harm, or, alternatively, for both military and civilian applications. Cyber intelligence and disease surveillance are both conducted by military and civilian agencies because malware and disease are both interpreted as threats to national security. 16 Furthermore, knowing how to detect malware can be used to help remove it or to hide the code and cause harm. Disease surveillance is rarely thought of in terms of potential harm, since the information it provides is intended to help reduce morbidity and mortality. But this information can also be used to stigmatize and discriminate against individuals and groups, as well as restrict travel and trade. Fear of misuse has fueled resistance to disease surveillance, including popular opposition to name-based reporting of HIV and government opposition to reporting outbreaks such as SARS and H5N1. [17] [18] [19] One consequence of these dual-use dilemmas is that cooperation is not inevitable, even when it would be advantageous for cyber or health security.",

Data collection and analysis are also balkanized. 40 Unlike epidemiology, where there is some consensus over CSTE case definitions, different vendors and CERTs use different nomenclature to name malware and count its frequency. Consequently, ''comparing incident statistics across teams is difficult and often meaningless,'' which diminishes the value of what little information is shared. 31(p83) Proposals for the federal government to establish authoritative standards and agencies have gained little traction. In 1989, the General Accounting Office (GAO) argued that internet security required a focal point. It proposed that the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) establish this focal point, but to no avail. 30 In 1991, the National Research Council recommended that the government help establish a nongovernmental organization to serve a similar function-again, with no apparent impact. 41 CERT/CC even pitched a similar proposal in 1997, which, by implication, was a concession that the CERT/CC had failed to establish itself as the single clearinghouse for cyber intelligence. 42 In 1998, President Bill Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63), 43 calling for ''A Public-Private Partnership'' to reduce the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber attack. PDD-63 encouraged the private sector to create an Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC), modeled on the CDC: As ultimately designed by private sector representatives, the ISAC may emulate particular aspects of such institutions as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that have proved highly effective. . 43 However, unlike the CDC (ie, a federal agency with police powers, informed by compulsory reporting at the state level), this ISAC was to be private and voluntary. Moreover, ''the single ISAC-the one PDD-63 calls for-was never built'' (interview with former US National Security Council staff, September 2015). Rather than establish a single clearinghouse, building separate ISACs became a business opportunity. 44 At least 19 sector-specific ISACs were subsequently established for financial services, energy, healthcare, and other parts of critical infrastructure. While reasonable, this outcome was not inevitable, especially since variation inside a given sector (eg, small and medium enterprises versus multinational corporations) may be just as significant for security as variation across sectors (eg, finance versus energy or healthcare).",

To this end, it is important to recognize how the design and implementation of electronic records are not merely functions of technical efficiency but rather choices with distributional consequences (ie, there are winners and losers). One potential advantage for public health agencies is that disease surveillance is ''hierarchical and relatively simple in structure.'' 58(p2) This structure places CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in a strong bargaining position to promote open standards for information sharing (including common nomenclature and data types). If harmonized, these standards can create network effects-namely, positive externalities-that substantially increase the volume and value of information available. So, in addition to modernizing the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS), the CDC and HHS should aggressively push the development and adoption of data standards, as well as ''meaningful use'' criteria for electronic health records to include public health. 59 ",

Ironically, this criticism echoes what some cybersecurity experts say about sharing information with intelligence agencies like the NSA. Given that the politics of American anti-statism resist increasing federal administration of public health surveillance, alternative approaches for improving collection, analysis, and reporting also warrant consideration.",

Ideally, it would combine the lessons learned from NH-ISAC with experience from CDC's pilot fusion center, BioPHusion. 61 Likewise, private sector participation may help this ISAC avoid some of the problems suffered by the DHS National Biosurveillance Integration Center. 62 The goals would be consistent with the CDC's surveillance strategy. 63 The ISAC could help make surveillance ''more adaptable to the rapidly changing technology landscape'' by allowing tech vendors and users to engage in an operational environment on an ongoing basis. 63 It could help make surveillance ''more versatile in meeting demands for expanding knowledge about evolving threats to health'' 63 by providing a sanctioned forum for stakeholders to share and SMITH evaluate heterogeneous data alongside internet-based surveillance (GPHIN, HealthMap, ProMED, etc), official sources (eg, NEDSS, Epi-X), and similar systems.

This article provides a foundation for further research, and an ISAC for public health surveillance may be found to complement the existing architecture. Even if the CDC rejects this particular approach, it can still learn from the successes and failures of cyber intelligence. This field is in touch with information technology, by definition.
