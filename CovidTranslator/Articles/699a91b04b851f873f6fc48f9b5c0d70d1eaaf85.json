Parenchymal involvement can be subdivided into inflammation of the gray matter, called poliomyelitis, and inflammation of the white matter, called leukomyelitis. Astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, blood vessels, and other support structures are often involved in the inflammatory process. The dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater compose the meninges that surround the spinal cord. The pia and arachnoid layers are morphologically similar and compose the leptomeningies. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is contained between the pia and arachnoid layers. The dura mater is the thick, tough collagen outer membrane. Inflammation of the meninges is termed meningitis. Most inflammatory diseases involve the brain, spinal cord, and associated membranes, resulting in a meningoencephalomyelitis. Table 1 lists the common causes of meningoencephalomyelitis in companion animals. This article focuses on the inflammatory diseases that principally involve the spinal cord and meninges.",

The cervical region is most commonly involved, but any cord segment can be affected. Additional features of meningitis include fever; a stiff, short-strided gait, and reluctance to walk. Frank neurologic deficits can occur with myelitis. Decreased to absent postural reactions and segmental reflexes are noticed with poliomyelitis. The clinical signs associated with leukomyelitis range from ataxia to paralysis, with segmental reflexes often being exaggerated. The gait and reflex abnormalities can involve the thoracic limbs, pelvic limbs, or both, based on lesion localization (see the article entitled \"Approaches to the Patient with Spinal Diseases\").

If pain is absent, the differential list would also include diseases that can produce clinical signs, ranging from ataxia to paralysis, with exaggerated spinal cord reflexes. The list can be prioritized based on signalment data. For example, cervical malformation/malarticulation (wobbler) is most likely to occur in giant breed dogs like the Great Dane and Doberman, atlantoaxial subluxation in miniature and toy breeds like the Chihuahua and Yorkshire Terrier, and degenerative myelopathy in the German Shepherd and Miniature Poodle.

A gastrointestinal or respiratory illness that precedes evidence of multifocal neurologic dysfunction is suggestive of CD infection. A thrombocytopenia or lymphopenia may be noticed, but hematologic results are typically nondiagnostic. Fluorescent antibody (FA) testing for viral antigens in conjunctival smears can be positive in dogs with CD. False-positive and false-negative results, however, are common, and interpretation of FA test results should always be in association with the appropriate clinical neurologic signs. Dogs with CD-associated encephalitis can have electroencephalographic abnormalities characterized by increased voltage and decreased frequency with spike and sharp waves. Chorioretinitis charac-terized by depigmentation and hyperreflectivity is noticed principally in dogs with CD-induced leukoencephalomyelopathy. 33 The most sensitive means of antemortem confirmation of CD virus meningoencephalomyelitis is by CSF analysis. I, 32, 33 Dogs with principally leukomyelopathy often have a lymphocytic pleocytosis (15 to 60 white blood cells (WBCs)/mm 3 ; normal = 0 to 4 WBCs/mm 3 ), increased total protein (35 to 55 mg/dL; normal = 20 to 25 mg/dL), and increased gamma globulin (9 to 11 mg/dL; normal = 5 to 7.5 mg/dL).32 CD virus antibody normally is absent in CSF and when present is highly diagnostic of CD virus infection of the CNS. A false-positive result can occur, however, if the CSF is contaminated by serum CD virus antibody following either iatrogenic or pathologic blood-brain barrier (BBB) disturbance.

Ticks serve as the reservoir and vector for both diseases. There is no sex, breed, or age predilection. In the acute phase, both diseases produce an immunemediated vasculitis in multiple organs involving capillaries, venules, small veins, and arterioles with attendant inflammation and necrosis. 12 , 39 Neurologic abnormalities, including hyperesthesia, cervical rigidity, ataxia, paresis-to-paralysis, vestibular dysfunction, and seizures have been reported to occur in approximately 30% of dogs affected with either disease. Nonneurologic signs include fever, depression, anorexia, and lymphadenopathy. Petechial hemorrhages or other signs of hemorrhagic diathesis are uncommon in both diseases but have been reported more frequently in ehrlichiosis. 12 Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypoalbuminemia occur commonly in both diseases, whereas leukopenia and hyperglobulinemia are more common in ehrlichiosis, and leukocytosis is more common in RMSF.12 A mild to moderate elevation in CSF protein and WBCs indicates CNS involvement. Neutrophils and lymphocytes are reported to be the most common cell types in CSF of dogs affected with RMSF and ehrlichiosis, respectively; however, this observation was based on a small number of cases. 12 Serologic testing is the mainstay of diagnosis. A single positive IgG titer is sufficient to diagnose ehrlichiosis, whereas a fourfold or greater rise in titer is needed to confirm RMSF.12 In both diseases, serum titers rise rapidly despite concurrent antibiotic therapy. The diagnosis of RMSF may also be confirmed on skin biopsy specimens by direct immunofluorescent testing. 4 Tetracycline (22 mg/kg orally every 8 hours) is effective in most cases of acute RMSF and ehrlichiosis. Doxycycline (5 mg/kg orally every 12 hours) and chloramphenicol (15 mg/kg orally every 8 hours) achieve higher concentrations in the CSF and may also be useful in cases with CNS involvement. Most affected dogs improve within 24 to 48 hours of starting treatment and have a good prognosis for recovery. 11 Recovery is predicated on the return to normal of clinical and hematologic abnormalities with concurrent declines in antibody titers. Antibody titers decrease in infected dogs typically after 6 to 10 months. Severely affected animals will have a slow recovery, and some animals will have permanent neurologic disabilities. Immune-mediated sequelae may cause neurologic dysfunction in some affected dogs 5 ; therefore the administration of immunosuppressive drugs (prednisone, 1 mg/kg slowly tapering to 0.5 mg/kg orally once daily for 2 to 15 months) in conjunction with tetracycline therapy has been suggested. Veterinarians are reminded that immunosuppressive therapy in rickettsial infections is controversial, and the administration of immunosuppressive drugs may worsen the clinical condition.",

In the United States, histoplasmosis is endemic in the Central Mississippi River Valley, the Ohio River Valley, and areas along the Appalachian Mountains 30 ; blastomycosis is endemic in the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio River Basins 26 ; and coccidioidomycosis is endemic in the Lower Sonoran life zone of the southwest. 22 Most fungi that infect domestic animals are saprophytic soil organisms. The routes of infection are typically by inhalation or ingestion. Most fungi are opportunistic organisms, and animals with fungal infections are usually immunosuppressed (e.g., young animals, concurrent infections, or immunosuppressive drug therapy23). Affected animals have systemic involvement, typically involving the lungs, intestines, lymph nodes, bone, heart, liver, skin, and eyes. Dissemination to the CNS is by hematogenous or lymphatic routes usually; however, infection may also reach the CNS by direct route (e.g., from nasal chambers, middle or inner ear). Cryptococcus neoformans and to a lesser extent Blastomyces dermatitidis have a predilection for CNS tissues and account for the majority of CNS fungal infections in small domestic animals. 11 The mycotic agents produce a disseminated granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis. Animals with meningomyelitis have clinical neurologic signs that range from cervical discomfort to paralysis depending on the severity of the mycotic infection; however, more commonly vestibular dysfunction and seizures accompany the meningomyelitis, indicating multifocal CNS involvement. Occasionally the clinical signs indicate a more focal disease process. Animals with fungal disease are often systemically ill with evidence of fever, weight loss, diarrhea, anorexia, and lethargy or depression. In addition, animals with cryptococcosis often have a naso-ocular discharge, sneezing, peripheral lymphadenopathy, and multiple skin lesions of the head, whereas animals with blastomycosis have ocular problems, inspiratory dyspnea or chronic cough, peripheral lymphadenopathy, and multiple skin lesions. 26 The strategies and diagnostic tests used to confirm mycosis of organ systems remote from the CNS are similar to those described for bacterial infections except for immunodiagnostic testing. Complementfixation test, gel diffusion precipitin test, tube agglutination test, and fluorescent immunoassay are used to detect antibody to specific fungi in various body fluids. The latex agglutination test is used to detect fungal antigen in various body fluids, whereas the fluorescent-antibody test is used to identify fungal organisms in tissues and cultures. A titer in serum of greater than 1:8 or a rising titer on one or a combination of these tests would be diagnostic of systemic mycosis. 18 Cytologic examination of body fluids or affected tissues can also confirm systemic mycosis.6, 23",

These drugs are considered useful in preventing development of intracellular tachyzoites; however, treatment is considered noneffective once neurologic signs have developed. Clindamycin (13.5 mg/kg orally every 8 hours) was effective in treating polymyositis attributed to T. gondiP3; however, once developed, resolution of pelvic limb hyperextension is unlikely, regardless of treatment.",

The cause, duration, and host response to the disease process will determine the clinical signs in individual animals. Confirmation of a specific causative agent is difficult, but CSF analysis and immunotesting of serum and CSF yield the most rewarding diagnostic results. Successful treatment is based on formulation of an appropriate and aggressive therapeutic regimen. In some diseases, no effective treatment is available, and some animals may develop permanent neurologic disabilities.",
