At these sites, we collect clinical data and mid-nasal swabs from individuals with at least two acute respiratory symptoms. Additionally, we collect residual nasal swabs and data from individuals who seek care for respiratory symptoms at four regional hospitals. Samples are tested using a multiplex molecular assay, and influenza whole genome sequencing is performed for samples with influenza detected. Geospatial mapping and computational modeling platforms are in development to characterize the regional spread of influenza and other respiratory pathogens.",

For example, rapid genome sequencing of influenza strains throughout a city could feed the creation of actionable maps that identify new and emerging influenza strains their transmission dynamics. With such a system in place, we can more effectively develop and test strategies to rapidly deploy vaccines, antivirals, and non-pharmaceutical interventions to areas with early influenza detection.

Survey data from eligible and enrolled participants in the community cross-sectional and prospective arms are collected through the FluTrack app (Audere, Seattle, WA), a mobile-enabled app created for the Seattle Flu Study and administered on a tablet. For participants unable or unfamiliar with the use of the tablet, questionnaires on the FluTrack app are administered by study staff verbally in English or Spanish. If the participant is under 7 years old, their LAR completes the questionnaire on their behalf. For participants aged 7-12 years, the LAR may decide whether to complete the survey on the participant's behalf or in collaboration. Participants aged 13 years or older complete the questionnaire. Data are collected on US Flu VE Network enrollees via interview and extraction from EMR and administrative healthcare databases.",

Total nucleic acids are extracted from 200 \u00b5l of UTM using Magna Pure 96 small total nucleic acids extraction kit (Roche). Extracted nucleic acids are screened for the presence of respiratory pathogens by TaqMan RT-PCR on the OpenArray platform (Thermo) ( Table 2 ). Specimens that test positive for influenza by RT-PCR are then sequenced using a modified oligo capture protocol. Total RNA is converted to cDNA and sequencing libraries are constructed using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Prep for Enrichment kit, as outlined by the manufacturer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Library samples are ranked by TaqMan CRT value, and 24 samples with similar CRT values are pooled prior to oligo capture. CRT values are further used to determine the viral load of each sample and inform the fraction of each capture pool that a given sample represents. Each pool of flu-positive samples is hybridized overnight to a custom pool of capture oligonucleotides following the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Twist Bioscience, San Francisco, CA). Final libraries are sequenced on the Illumina Miseq, NextSeq or NovaSeq platform with paired end 150bp reads.",
