To explore the genesis of SARS-ON, the FDOD method previously developed by us was applied to comparing complete genomes from 12 SARS-CoV isolates to those from 12 previously identified coronaviruses and an unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed. Our results show that all SARS-CoV isolates were clustered into a clique and previously identified coronaviruses formed the other clique. Meanwhile, the three groups of coronaviruses depart from each other clearly in our tree that is consistent with the results of prevenient papers. Differently, from the topology of the phylogenetic tree we found that SARS-CoV is more close to group 1 within genus coronavirus. The topology map also shows that the 12 SARS-CoV isolates may be divided into two groups determined by the association with the SARS-CoV from the Hotel M in Hong Kong that may give some information about the infectious relationship of the SARS.",

Meanwhile, due to the limitation of data, Ruan et al. have to restrict their research to 26140 loci.

Differently, 1176 Rota et al. regard SARS-CoV as a distinct group within the genus Coronavirus based on alignment of amino acid sequences[I-4 J . Prevenient paper shows that poorly conserved or variable-length region is not reliable for phylogeny construction based on aligmnent [12,13 J . Since the similarity between SARS-CoV and coronaviruses was very 10w[2 J , the new method would be needed to build the phylogenetic tree. The results are based on our new method that circumambulate alignment of sequences and the results are supported moderately by some evidence related to serology. Ksiazek et alY4J performed immunohistochemical assays with various antibodies reactive with coronaviruses from three groups and with the immune serum specimen from a SARS patient. Their result demonstrated strongly cytoplasmic and membranous staining of infected cells with antibodies related to coronaviruses of group 1 while no staining was identified with any antibodies related to coronaviruses of groups 2 and 3.",

The result shows an infectious relationship map for 12 SARS-CoV isolates which is very similar to that drawn by Ruan et alP] (Fig. 3) . 12 SARS-CoV isolates form two main groups (designated \"Local spread\" and \"Global spread\") determined by the association with the exposure at Hotel M in Hong Kong. The SARS_SG_3, as a secondary contact case, looks obviously like an ancestral strain among 5 isolates that came from Singapore. However, it is also consistent with the results of Ruan et al. and they attributed it to a potentially back mutational event during the transmission of the virus. SARS_TWI is placed within the cluster \"Global spread\" which includes the isolates that are directly or indirectly associated with the infection at Hotel M such as SARS_TOR2, SARS_ HK_2, SARS_Urban, etc. We cannot decide which one of two main groups SARS_HK_1 should be located in, since its contact history is not available.",
