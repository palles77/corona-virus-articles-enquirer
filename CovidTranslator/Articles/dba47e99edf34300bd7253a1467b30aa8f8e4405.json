Here we found PRRSV A2MC2 induced type I IFNs in cultured cells. A2MC2 replication in MARC-145 cells resulted in the synthesis of IFN-a2 protein, transcript elevation of the IFN-stimulated genes ISG15 and ISG56, and the proteins of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) and ISG56. A2MC2 infection of primary porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) also led to the elevation of the two proteins, but had little cytopathic effect. Furthermore, A2MC2 infection of MARC-145 or PAM cells had no detectable inhibitory effect on the ability of IFN-a to induce an antiviral response. Sequencing analysis indicated that A2MC2 was closely related to VR-2332 and Ingelvac PRRS MLV with an identity of 99.8% at the nucleotide level. The identification of this IFN-inducing PRRSV isolate may be beneficial for vaccine development against PRRS.",

The innate immune system is activated after cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRR) sense pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of invading pathogens. Host PRRs for RNA viruses include Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Activation of the TLR or RLR pathways eventually leads to the secretion of type I IFNs. The binding of type I IFNs to their receptors activates the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, which induces expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and results in the establishment of an antiviral state (Darnell et al., 1994; Schindler and Darnell, 1995; Stark et al., 1998) .",

PRRSV can also inhibit IFN downstream signaling and expression of ISGs in both MARC-145 and PAM cells (Patel et al., 2010) . The nuclear translocation of STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 heterotrimers was blocked in PRRSV-infected cells, while the IFNinduced phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 was not affected. Many efforts to control PRRS have been attempted, but few are successful because of the antigenic and genomic diversity among PRRSV isolates, and persistence of the virus in infected herds. Attenuated live virus vaccines have been commercially available for years; however, outbreaks of PRRS resulting from viral strains nearly identical in sequence to the vaccine strain have been reported (Botner et al., 1997; Opriessnig et al., 2002) . Outbreaks of atypical or acute PRRS in vaccinated pigs have raised serious concern about the efficacy and safety of the current vaccines (Madsen et al., 1998; Meng, 2000) .",

There were a total of 28 nucleotide (nt) variations when compared to VR-2332, resulting in 14 amino acid changes (Supplementary Table 1 ). The nucleotide variations are scattered from nt 4681 to the end of the genome (Fig. 2 ). The first 4680 nucleotides are identical to VR-2332. There were a total of 34 nucleotide variations when compared to strain MLV, resulting in 19 different amino acids. Compared to both VR-2332 and MLV, A2MC2 has 15 unique nucleotides scattered from nt 4681 to the end of the genome (Fig. 2) . Ten of the unique changes are between nt 4681 and nt 10037 of the A2MC2 genome. The sequence from nt 11667 to 14420 of A2MC2 is the same as VR-2332 except 4 unique nucleotide variations.

Six unique amino acid changes occurred in A2MC2 when compared to VR-2332 and MLV: threonine to serine in nsp8, serine to alanine and proline to leucine in nsp10, serine to glycine in nsp12, methionine to valine, and isoleucine to valine in GP3 (Table 1) . Nsp10 is a RNA helicase that unwinds dsRNA (Bautista et al., 2002) , while the functions of nsp8 and nsp12 are unknown. GP3 is a glycoprotein found in PRRSV virions as a minor structural component (de Lima et al., 2009) .

STAT1 and STAT2 proteins are key players in JAK-STAT signaling, a pathway activated by type I IFNs (Darnell et al., 1994; Schindler and Darnell, 1995; Stark et al., 1998) . Phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 is an early step in the pathway after IFNs bind to their receptors. To determine if A2MC2-induced IFNs resulted in the activation of these two proteins, we tested the phosphorylation status of STAT1 and STAT2 in MARC-145 cells at 0, 9, 16 and 24 hpi. The selection of 9 hpi was based on the speculation that after increase of IFN-b transcript at 8 hpi, phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 would be detected. The inclusion of 16 and 24 hpi was based on the speculation that along with the increase of IFN-b expression, phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 would continue. The result showed that the levels of phosphorylated STAT1 at tyrosine 701 (STAT1-Y701) and STAT2 at tyrosine 690 (STAT2-Y690) were greatly increased at 9 hpi (Fig. 6C) , indicating A2MC2-induced IFNs led to the activation of STAT1 and STAT2. Moreover, the total STAT2 and ISG56 were detectable at 9 hpi and increased at 16 and 24 hpi (Fig. 6C ). This result suggested that A2MC2-induced IFNs resulted in the activation of JAK-STAT signaling, which then led to the increased expression of STAT2 and ISG56.",

Compared to uninfected cells, A2MC2 infection resulted in the elevation of STAT2 and IFI56 (equivalent to ISG56 in primates), while VR-2385 led to no change of these two proteins, and MLV led to a slight elevation of STAT2 (Fig. 7A) .

This result indicated that A2MC2 and MLV had an undetectable effect on IFN downstream signaling while VR-2385 inhibited the IFN activation in PAMs. The IFN bioassay was conducted to assess IFNs in culture supernatant of A2MC2-infected PAMs. CRL2843 cells are immortalized porcine alveolar macrophages that are not susceptible to PRRSV infection (Weingartl et al., 2002) .

This result indicated To determine if the induction of IFNs by A2MC2 is not limited to PAMs from one piglet, PAMs from three other piglets were inoculated with A2MC2 and incubated for 20 h. Western blot analysis showed that A2MC2 infection induced the elevation of STAT2 in PAM cells from all three other piglets (Fig. 7C) .

Vero cells are defective in IFN production and not susceptible to PRRSV. Pretreatment of the cells with dilutions of A2MC2-derived supernatant induced an antiviral response in Vero cells that inhibited the replication of NDV.

            "text": "Second, the elevated expression of STAT2 and ISG56 was shown in A2MC2-infected MARC-145 cells. Virus replication was essential for the elevation of the two proteins because UVinactivated virus and PPMO inhibition of PRRSV replication did not lead to elevation of these host proteins. The results suggested that viral replication in the cytoplasm stimulated PRRs, leading to IFN synthesis. The elevation of the transcripts of ISG15 and ISG56 further confirmed the observation. This result also ruled out the possibility of contamination by other swine pathogens because PPMO-mediated inhibition of A2MC2 led to an absence of IFN induction. Other common swine pathogens, such as porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) or swine influenza virus (SwIV), can induce synthesis of a high level bioactive IFN-a (Van Reeth et al., 1999) . Interestingly, A2MC2 infection at different MOIs induced variable levels of ISG expression. The higher the MOI, the earlier A2MC2 induced ISG elevation. The lower the MOI, the later the virus-induced ISG expression and the lower level of induction. This result provided an explanation as to why an MOI of 1 TCID 50 per cell led to a lower virus yield than MOIs of 0.1 and 0.01 TCID 50 . It indicates that the inoculum of 0.01 TCID 50 per cell resulted in limited initial virus replication, leading to a weaker stimulation on cellular PRRs, which allowed the virus to complete its replication cycles. On the other hand, the inoculum at 1 TCID 50 per cell stimulated a more robust response in regards to PRRs and IFN synthesis, which in turn inhibited virus spread to neighboring cells or continued replication.",

It was possible that there were other subtypes of type I IFNs in the supernatant from A2MC2-infected cells, as IFN-b mRNA level significantly increased. We further tested IFN production in A2MC2 infection of PAM cells. The STAT2 and IFI56 were elevated in A2MC2-infected cells, but not in VR-2385-infected cells. The A2MC2 induction of IFNs was pig-independent as PAMs isolated from three other pigs had similar elevations of STAT2 after A2MC2 infection.

This result is consistent with a previous report that virulent strain VR-2385 inhibits IFN signaling while MLV does not (Patel et al., 2010) . The plaque morphology of A2MC2 was much smaller than that of MLV, which indicated that MLV replicated with faster kinetics than A2MC2 in MARC-145 cells. In addition, A2MC2 infection did not lead to any observable cytopathic effect in PAM cells, and A2MC2-infected cells were of similar viability as mock-infected or MLV-infected cells. These features indicated that like MLV, A2MC2 might be less suitable to replicate in PAMs. The well-characterized cellular PRRs for IFN production during virus infection include the TLR and RLR pathways. Activation of either the TLR or the RLR pathway leads to the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), followed by its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of type I IFNs. We tested if A2MC2 replication led to IRF-3 phosphorylation using polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), as a positive control. The phosphorylated IRF-3 was detected in the poly(I:C)-treated cells but undetectable in cells infected with A2MC2 (data not shown). The result that A2MC2 infection led to increase of IFN-b transcript from 8 hpi to less than 1000-fold at 24 hpi (Fig. 6) indicated that A2MC2 replication might lead to a low level of IRF-3 signaling for an extended period. The reason for this conjecture is that poly(I:C) treatment led to over a 10,000-fold induction of IFN-b transcript with a peak at 6 h after treatment (data not shown). The continuous detection of phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT2 in A2MC2-infected MARC-145 cells from 9 to 24 hpi supports this speculation, while stimulation with external IFN-a leads to transient increase of phosphorylation of STAT1 that was reduced below the detection level after 2.5 h treatment (Patel et al., 2010) .",

PRRSV strains A2MC2, VR-2385, NVSL 97-7895, and Ingelvac PRRS MLV were used to inoculate MARC-145 cells at 1 multiplicity of infection (MOI). Virus titers were determined in MARC-145 cells for the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ), as previously described (Zhang et al., 2006) . Avirulent LaSota Newcastle disease virus carrying the gene of green fluorescence protein (NDV-GFP) was propagated in Vero cells, as previously described (Kim and Samal, 2010) .",
