Other studies have demonstrated that the human Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) can cleave the HA of human seasonal influenza viruses. Consequently, we have investigated the use of human Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 to produce high titre influenza haemmagglutinin (HA) lentiviral pseudotypes from Group 2 influenza viruses. Such pseudotypes represent powerful and safe tools to study viral entry and immune responses. Influenza pseudotype particles are obtained by co-transfecting human embryonic kidney HEK293T/17 cells using plasmids coding for the influenza HA, HIV gag-pol and a lentiviral vector incorporating firefly luciferase. However, in order to produce Group 2 pseudotypes, it was necessary to co-transfect a plasmid expressing the TMPRSS2 endoprotease, to achieve the necessary HA cleavage for infective particle generation. These lentiviral pseudotypes were shown to transduce HEK293T/17 cells with high efficiency. This demonstrates that TMPRSS2 is necessary for the functional activation, in vitro, of both the HA of human seasonal influenza and other Group 2 HA influenza strains. Additionally, we show that the Group 2 influenza pseudotype particles can be used as surrogate antigens in neutralization assays and are efficiently neutralized by corresponding influenza virus reference sera. These data demonstrate that the viral pseudotype system is a powerful method for serological surveillance of a wide range of influenza viruses.",

            "text": "Influenza A viruses are disease-causing agents in humans and animals, which have a reservoir in wild birds, especially Charadriiformes and Anseriformes (Olsen et al, 2006) . Influenza A viruses are classified using the antigenic characteristic of the envelope glycoproteins haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Currently, using antigenic characteristics and phylogenetic analysis, 17 different haemagglutinin subtypes are recognized and are divided into two lineages: Group-1 and Group-2 ( Figure 1 ) (R\u00f6hm et al, 1996; Fouchier et al, 2005; Tong et al, 2012) . Of the 17 haemagglutinin subtypes only two, H1 and H3, cause seasonal epidemics in the human population. However, viruses belonging to other subtypes have shown the capacity for avian-to-human transmission and their spread needs to be monitored in avian and mammalian populations for pandemic preparedness (Peiris, 2009 ). This can be achieved using serological and molecular biological diagnostic methods that permit the identification of haemagglutinin subtypes (Cattoli and Terregino, 2008) . The haemagglutinin is the major target of antibody response against influenza viruses. It is the trimeric envelope glycoprotein necessary for entry into susceptible cells. Each HA monomer is produced as a single polypeptide precursor, HA0, that during maturation is cleaved into two subunits, HA1 and HA2. This process is a necessary step to acquire fusion activity and infectivity of influenza. When multiple basic amino acid residues (lysine and arginine) are situated immediately before the cleavage arginine, the haemagglutinin is cleaved by ubiquitously expressed subtilisin-like endoproteases, such as furin. This determines the virulence and lethality for several avian species observed in the high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) strains H5 and H7 (Garten and Klenk, 2008) . On the other hand, cleavage at the single arginine (or lysine) amino acid at the HA cleavage site of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) strains, human and mammalian influenza viruses is thought to be mediated by tissue-specific proteases. Recently, different human lung proteases belonging to the serine protease family that are able to cleave the haemagglutinin of human influenza strains were identified: Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 and 4 (TMPRSS2/4) and Human Airway Trypsin-like protease (HAT) (B\u00f6ttcher et al, 2006; Bertram et al, 2010) . To date, the proteases that cleave the haemagglutinin of LPAI strains are still unidentified. To study the HA cleavage of human seasonal strains (H1 and H3) by TMPRSS2, HAT and their avian and mammalian homologous proteases, pseudotype lentiviral particles are a suitable approach (Bertram et al, 2012) . Influenza pseudotype particles (pp) represent powerful and safe tools to study both the antibody response directed against the influenza haemagglutinin and the viral entry mechanism (Garcia and Lai, 2011) . In the present study, we use a pseudotype generation system to investigate human TMPRSS2 and its role in mediating the conversion of human and LPAI HA0s into their active forms, and we show that the pseudotypes produced can be efficiently used in a virus neutralization assay.",

Fortyeight hours post-transfection supernatant was harvested, filtered through 0.45 \u03bcm filters and stored at -80\u00b0C. Pseudotyped particles were also produced in the absence of pCAGGS-TMPRSS2 plasmid (\u0394TMPRSS2). Titration of the pseudotype particles was performed by transducing HEK293T/17 cells (1 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well), with 50 \u03bcl of neat pseudotype supernatant and subsequent 1:2 serial dilutions. The \u0394TMPRSS2 influenza pseudotypes were titrated in the absence or presence of TPCK-Trypsin to evaluate the effect of endogenous TMPRSS2 expression and to activate the haemagglutinin to obtain functional pseudotypes. TPCK-Trypsin (Sigma) was added to the pseudotypes to obtain the final concentration of 50 \u03bcg/ml and maintaining constant the TPCK-Trypsin concentration during the serial dilution. After 30 min at 37\u00b0C, 50 \u03bcl of trypsin neutralizing solution (Lonza) were added to each well. After 48 hrs, luminescence of cell cultures (in relative luminescence units or RLUs) was evaluated by luminometry using the Bright-Glo assay system (Promega, UK). Titres were expressed in RLU/ml.",

However further studies need to be performed to determine the function of TMPRSS2 and other proteases (e.g., HAT) in haemagglutinin activation and cleavage, to examine the cleavage kinetics and to understand the haemagglutinin amino acid residues involved in the haemagglutinin-protease interaction.

Additionally, since the pseudotypes described are replication-defective, they offer a safe alternative to wild type virus methods that require biosafety level 3 containment, and the detection of antibody response is not influenced by the variability of blood-based reagents as observed in other assays (i.e. erythrocytes in haemagglutination inhibition) (Rowe et al, 1999) . Furthermore, the pseudotype neutralization assay appears to be more effective than other functional assays to detect the antibody response directed against the HA2 haemagglutinin stalk (Corti et al, 2011) . This is most likely due to the fact that, with the absence of neuraminidase on the pseudotype particle membrane surface, glycoprotein density is reduced and the HA stalk thus becomes more accessible to antibodies. Consequently, pseudotypes could be used to effectively study heterosubtypic antibody responses directed against the HA stalk region. In this study, with the production of Group-2 influenza pseudotypes we present a proof-of-principle for their use as surrogate antigens in antibody neutralization assays. We demonstrate that reference influenza antisera efficiently neutralize the matched pseudotypes. Interestingly, the human A/Udorn/307/1972 (H3N2) pseudotype is not efficiently neutralized by its paired (H3N8) avian antisera compared with the sheep H3N2 antisera. This is probably due to the fact that H3 avian viruses belong to a different lineage with respect to the human H3 (Zhang et al, 2007) . Variation in the antisera neutralizing titres is also observed when the H7 antisera are tested. This is related to the origin of the antisera: they were generated against different H7 virus strains from the H7 pseudotype strain. This also may reflect intra-subtype antigenic differences among H7 strains. Furthermore the different antisera preparations probably have different neutralizing titres against their own viral strain.",
