Since the proportion of snakes in bushmeat gradually increases, human pentastomiasis is an emerging zoonotic disease. To substantiate the significance of this threat, we surveyed snakes offered for human consumption at bushmeat markets in the Kole district, Democratic Republic of the Congo, for the presence of adult pentastomids. In Bitis vipers (n = 40), Armillifer spp. infestations exhibited an 87.5% prevalence and 6.0 median intensity. Parasite abundance covaried positively with viper length, but not with body mass. In pythons (n = 13), Armillifer spp. exhibited a 92.3% prevalence and 3.5 median intensity. The positive correlations between parasite abundance and python length or mass were statistically nonsignificant. Ninety-one percent of A. grandis were discovered in vipers and 97% of infected vipers hosted A. grandis, whereas 81% of A. armillatus specimens were found in pythons and 63% of infected pythons hosted A. armillatus. Thus, challenging the widespread notion of strict host specificity, we found 'reversed' infections and even a case of coinfection. In this study, we also gathered information about the snake consumption habits of different tribal cultures in the area. Infective parasite ova likely transmit to humans directly by consumption of uncooked meat, or indirectly through contaminated hands, kitchen tools or washing water.",

For rural populations in tropical regions, such as Subsaharan Africa, bushmeat is a major source of protein (Fa et al. 2003) , and also a vital source of financial income for households living in extreme poverty (de Merode et al. 2004 ). Hunting of wild animals is significantly increasing not only due to the continuous increase in the human population, but also as earlier impenetrable rainforests become accessible through the expansion of roads related to extractive industries such as logging (Wilkie et al. 1992; Laurance et al. 2006 ) and mining (Edwards et al. 2014 ). When tackling the species composition of bushmeat, most studies focus on large-bodied mammals and birds. However, since overexploitation depleted populations of the more sought birds and mammals (Nasi et al. 2011) , largebodied reptiles, such as snakes, monitors, crocodilians, turtles and tortoises, are also found in increasing numbers at bushmeat markets (Chifundera Kusamba et al. 2014) .",

Armillifer grandis and A. armillatus have recently been identified as more widespread human pathogens in rural tropical Africa than previously thought. Their typical intermediate hosts are rodents and small-bodied primates, while they utilize snakes as defini-tive (final) hosts (Tappe et al. 2015) . Specifically, adult A. armillatus are presumed to occur in the respiratory tracts of African pythons (e.g., Python sebae and P. regius), while adult A. grandis inhabits the lungs and tracheae of largebodied African 'puff adders' (e.g., Bitis gabonica and B. nasicornis) (Christoffersen and De Assis 2013) . Unfortunately, host specificity data provided by early authors have limited values due to low sample sizes and the often unreliable identification of parasites. These snakes are among the most harvested reptile species sold for human consumption at Central and West African bushmeat markets (Chifundera Kusamba et al. 2014) .",

All snakes offered for sale originated from the vicinity (< 160 km) of the town of Kole, except for a single python that was transported from Katanda, approx. 500 km away). Snake body length and mass were measured when possible, or at least estimated if the snake was already decapitated. Subsequently, snakes were dissected on the spot, and the respiratory organs (and their surrounding tissues) were inspected for adult pentastomids that are well visible to the naked eye ( Fig. 1 ). Parasites were extracted using forceps and placed in 97% ethanol for subsequent morphological examination. Specimens with 19 annulations were identified as A. armillatus, and those with 26-28 (most often 26) annulations as A. grandis (Pantchev and Tappe 2011) .",

Consumption of snakes as bushmeat seems to be the general reason behind the emerging epidemics of human pentastomiasis. However, the precise way of parasite transmission is still not known.

The specific gender-related food taboos of the Songye people, provided they are actually obeyed in practice, may offer the chance to deduce the route of infection by future gender-based prevalence studies.

There is a clear necessity of surveillance of parasite infections in bushmeat, and particularly in large-bodied vipers and pythons offered for human consumption to detect and prevent zoonotic diseases (Karesh and Noble 2009 ). In the short run, pictured brochures are needed to disseminate basic knowledge to local tribesmen about the role of snakes as sources of zoonotic threat and the necessary hygienic measures to avoid it.
