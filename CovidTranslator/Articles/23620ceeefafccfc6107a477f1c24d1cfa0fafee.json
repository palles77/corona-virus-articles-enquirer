            "text": "Intestinal immune response plays an important defensive role for pathogens, particularly for those transmitted by the oro-faecal route or for foecal shedding modulation. This work examined three parts of intestine from twelve gilts experimentally infected with PCV2spiked semen, six vaccinated (V group) and six unvaccinated (NV group) against PCV2, 29 and 53 days post infection (DPI). An immunohistochemical investigation for IgA-, IgGand IgM-antibody bearing plasma cells (PCs) was run on intestinal samples coupled with a sandwich immunohistochemical method to reveal anti-PCV2 antibody-secreting PCs. Plasma cell density was compared in the two groups of animals at 29 and 53 DPI. The IgA, IgG and IgM PC density did not differ between groups but displayed an increase from the upper (villus) to the lower part of the crypts while a decreasing trend in PC density was identified from duodenum to ileum. In the NV group, no increase in anti-PCV2 PC density was demonstrable in the two sampling moment: the amounts of lamina propria PCV2-specific antibody-producing PCs remained constant, 10.55 \u00b1 4.24 and 10.06 \u00b1 5.01 at 29 DPI and 53 DPI, respectively. In the V group a significant increase in PCV2-specific antibody-producing PCs was observed over time. The amounts of PCV2-specific antibodyproducing PCs increased from 9.37 \u00b1 13.36 at 29 DPI to 18.76 \u00b1 15.83 at 53 DPI. The data on IgA, IgM and IgG PC counts can be considered reference values in a population of adult pigs. The sandwich method can be proposed as a technique able to identify specific antibodysecreting PCs in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. A practical application of the sandwich method is the demonstration of a \"booster-like\" response of the lamina propria in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated animals. After virus challenge, vaccination induced an increase in the number of PCs containing specific anti-PCV2 antibodies at the level of intestinal mucosa.",

            "text": "Broadly speaking, the organization of the mucosal immune system can be divided into: (a) inductive sites and, (b) effector sites. Inductive sites are where the uptake of antigens from the mucosal surface and the priming of na\u00efve T and B lymphocytes occurs. The other sites recruit several effector mechanisms including the production of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) antibodies (Brandtzaeg et al., 2008) . The inductive sites of mucosal immunity include well-defined tissues such as the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) (Liebler-Tenorio and Pabst, 2006) and the loco-regional lymph nodes. The effector sites encompasses different and not well-delimited compartments, such as the lamina propria of the various mucous membranes that should not be considered part of the MALT (Brandtzaeg et al., 2008) . The organization of the immune system in the intestinal mucosa includes non-encapsulated and concentrated lymphoid tissue (Peyer's patches of the ileum and jejunum) (Burkey et al., 2009) constituting the inductive sites that also include part of the epithelium associated with the follicles (Sato and Iwasaki, 2005) . A diffuse non-encapsulated compartment, including cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells) located outside Peyer's patches but residing in the lamina propria, represents the effector sites where effector mechanisms of cell-mediated and humoral immunity take place (Tizard, 2013) . Plasma cells are located mainly around the intestinal crypts and form the secretory component of the mucosal immune system, devoted to the production of protective humoral factors acting on the mucosal surface.",

Therefore the intestinal mucosal immune system has attracted much research interest in recent years. Mucosal responses are more difficult to assess than systemic responses. Mucosal immunity assays can be run through quantifying cell subpopulations (mononuclear cells, neutrophils) or by analyzing immune-related molecules (cytokines, immunoglobulins). There is no gold standard for evaluating secretory immunity in mucosal surfaces. The humoral mucosal immune system can be examined with the same techniques used for serology. A critical point is the sampling of secretions, which may be affected by serum or blood contamination, or excessive dilution by other contaminants (ingesta or enzymes) (Guy, 2002) . Flushing the mucosal surface does not always allow the collection of immunoglobulins contained in the mucosal surface film, if the film is highly viscous. In these cases, scraping the mucosal surface ensures a more suitable sample for analysis compared to simple flushing, but can increase serum leakage.",

            "text": "This study quantified the density and distribution pattern of IgA-, IgG-and IgM-bearing PCs in the intestinal lamina propria of normal swine intestinal tracts. PC distribution in the intestinal mucosa along the villus-crypt axis progressively increases (s.c. vertical gradient) whereas it decreases from duodenum to ileum (s.c. horizontal gradient), and IgA-containing PCs predominate over the other two isotypes. Our results confirm the existence of the different distribution patterns of PCs in the intestine as reported by Porter (1973, 1977) and support the application of the method to study one aspect of the mucosal immune response. From the literature, it is known that the IgA-and IgM-bearing PCs are more numerous than the IgG-containing PCs in the intestinal mucosa (Stokes and Bailey, 2000) . PC distribution is not uniform along the small intestine (Allen and Porter, 1973) : in the duodenum lamina propria the PCs are about tenfold more than the amounts found in the jejunum (Allen and Porter, 1973) , independently of the immunoglobulin isotype Porter, 1973, 1977) . The distribution is not uniform even along the villus-crypt axis: in suckling piglets both IgAand IgM-containing PCs are more numerous in the lamina propria around the crypt, than in the villus lamina propria (Allen and Porter, 1973) . This feature is consistent with the \"physiology\" to concentrate IgA-secreting cells at this level: primed lymphocytes migrate here, as reported by Bimczok and Rothk\u00f6tter (2006) , from post-capillary venules of the lamina propria, that are numerous around the crypts. Another possible explanation is related to the distribution of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) in the intestine (Marsilio et al., 2011) . From the above, the importance of displaying the exact histological location of immune cells in the mucosa is clear in order to have comparative data from normal to pathologic conditions. Of note from the results of this work is the assessment of the specificity and repeatability of the sandwich immunohistochemical technique to PCV2. The specificity of the sandwich method was proved by the absence of staining when either the viral suspension or the primary anti-PCV2 antibody was omitted. The method was planned on the basis of a technique proposed by Kipar et al. (1998) that disclosed anti-feline coronavirus-specific antibodies in PCs of the granulomata in feline infectious peritonitis, suggesting the use of a viral suspension as a preliminary step followed by a classical IHC stain directed to the virus.",

The most important deficiency of these techniques is that they cannot detect the spatial distribution of immune cells in the tissue in which they are located. Another way to assess mucosal humoral immune response is to test the amounts of antibodies in intestinal lavage/fluids by serological investigations.

            "text": "Immunolabelling by sandwich technique, and in anti-PCV2 antibody-bearing PCs, has also been revealed in macrophages, endothelial cells and in the luminal border of some crypt epithelial cells. The presence of the stain in these cell types can be due to wild replicating PCV2, because they represent a target for the virus. However other explanations for the stain linked to the use of the viral suspension can be argued. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are known to be present on the cell surface and in the endosomal vesicles of macrophages (Ackermann, 2012) . In particular, swine macrophages bear cytoplasmic TLR-9 with a high affinity for methylated CpG motifs, a DNA pattern highly shared among viruses (Vincent et al., 2007 ; Table 2 Mean \u00b1 SD of IgA-, IgG-, IgM-and anti-PCV2 Ig-producing plasma cell density (PCs/10,000 2 ) of the individual areas in the 2 groups of animals. Fairbairn et al., 2011) . Moreover, macrophage cellular proteins, including complement factor C1qB, are known to interact with the PCV2 capsid (Meng, 2013) . The affinity for such molecules can explain the positive cytoplasmic reaction of macrophages by the sandwich technique, but the morphological diversity of the labelled cells (plasma cells vs macrophages) is sufficient to avoid confusing macrophages with the count of PCs containing anti-PCV2 Igs. The cytoplasmic immunolabelling of endothelial cells can be due to the crossing of Igs through the endothelium similarly to the apical immunolabelling of crypt cells due to crossing of IgA; a role for TLR cannot be excluded also in endothelial cells (Snoeck et al., 2006) . From the in vivo results of the trial used to obtain the samples for this investigation, the animals (V and NV groups) had similar serological titres that do not fit with a significantly lower frequency of viraemia and viral shedding in the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated group (Sarli et al., 2012) .",

It is likely that exposure to the PCV2 used for infection could have contributed to a faster increase in the local response following a primary specific immunization by the vaccine that was lacking in NV animals. Parenteral administration of the vaccine presumably enhanced the mucosal as well as the systemic immune response. This can be considered a \"booster-like\" effect of the vaccine and a way to explain the lower frequency of viraemia and reduction of faecal shedding in the vaccinated animals (Sarli et al., 2012) . Vaccination is known to reduce the clinical manifestations of PCVD, and the results of the present investigation show that it also exerts an effect on the intestinal mucosal immune response.",

Besides this, the sandwich method can also serve to identify specific antibody-secreting PCs in formalin-fixed paraffinembedded tissues also in other settings. Finally a practical application of the sandwich method is the demonstration of a \"booster-like\" response of the lamina propria in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated animals. After virus challenge, vaccination did seem to induce an increase in the number of PCs containing specific anti-PCV2 antibodies at the level of intestinal mucosa.",
