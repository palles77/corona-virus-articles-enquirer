Nanomaterials are increasingly finding uses in products such as antimicrobial surface coatings and semiconductors. These include spherical, cubic, and needle-like nanoscaled particles (approximately 5\u00c0100 nm) and near-nanoscaled devices (up to micrometers) [1] . Properties of nanoparticles, for example, their active surface area, chemical reactivity, and biological activity, can be dramatically different from those of micrometer-sized particles [2] , and indeed the biocidal effectiveness of metallic nanoparticles has been suggested to be due to both their size and their high surface-to-volume ratio. These characteristics should allow them to closely interact with microbial membranes, and thus elicit an antimicrobial effect that is not solely due to the release of metal ions [3] . Metallic and other nanoparticles are now being combined with polymers and other base materials and coated onto surfaces which may have a variety of potential antimicrobial applications within the oral cavity [4, 5] .",

The composition of the microbial flora of the mouth thus varies considerably from site to site and at different time points. Up to 1000 different species of bacteria at 10 8 \u00c010 9 bacteria per milliliter saliva or per milligram dental plaque are known to be associated with the oral cavity, and it has been suggested that only 50% of the bacteria found at these sites can be cultured [6] .",

Oral infections may arise either from an endogenous source, i.e., one yielding microorganisms normally found in the mouth, such as plaque-related dental caries and periodontal disease, or an exogenous source yielding microorganisms not normally found as part of the oral microflora. Dental caries and periodontal disease involve the adherence of bacteria and development of biofilms on both the natural and the restored tooth surface. The use of nanotechnology offers the possibility to control the formation of these and other oral biofilms through the use of nanoparticles with biocidal, antiadhesive, and delivery capabilities.",

On the tooth surface, the initial colonizers adhere to the acquired pellicle, a salivary/dietary-derived proteinaceous layer, which can then influence the subsequent sequence of colonization by microorganisms [8] . The acquired pellicle also contains several salivary components such as secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and lysozyme, and these provide both barrier and buffering functions [9] . Both de-and remineralization processes of the teeth are also mediated by the pellicle. In terms of bacterial colonization, many of the proteins that make up the pellicle act as receptors for the specific interaction with adhesins on the surface of pioneer bacterial species [9] . The pellicle layer is therefore of particular relevance for the interactions of both bacteria and nanoparticles with the tooth surface.",

The initial communities of bacteria found within the supragingival plaque biofilm are of a relatively low diversity in comparison to those present in the mature communities of both supra-and subgingival plaque. Initial colonizers include Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Streptococcus mitis. The coaggregating partners with these bacteria would then include predominantly gram-negative species, e.g., Veillonella atypica, Eikenella corrodens, and Prevotella loescheii. Coaggregation bridges between these early colonizers and Fusobacterium nucleatum are common and the latter then coaggregates with numerous late colonizers. Late colonizers include Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, and Porphyromonas gingivalis [10] .

Periodontal disease may be confined to the gingiva (gingivitis) or extend to the deeper supporting structures with destruction of the periodontal ligament and the alveolar bone that supports the teeth (periodontitis). This loss of attachment, with associated periodontal pocket formation, may ultimately lead to loosening and loss of the affected teeth. P. gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and T. denticola are now regarded as the major pathogens in advancing periodontitis [15] .",

Whereas, agents classified as antimicrobial act by inhibiting the growth (bacteriostatic) or killing (bactericidal) microorganisms, as defined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), respectively. The uptake and penetration of antimicrobial agents into biofilms are key considerations in the administration of therapeutics [21] . This is of particular importance within the oral cavity when these agents have to reach less accessible stagnation sites or through plaque to the enamel. The development of plaque control measures that require a minimum of patient compliance and professional health-care intervention are therefore of particular interest [22] . Within this context, antimicrobial nanoparticles may be of particular value if retained at approximal teeth surfaces and below the gum margin. The anticaries potential of fluoride and other conventional antimicrobial/antiplaque agents, which are mostly deployed in mouthwashes and toothpastes, have been well characterized [16] . The potential of nanoparticles as constituents of topical agents to control oral biofilms through either their biocidal or antiadhesive capabilities has now emerged as an area that should be given serious consideration. The studies by Robinson et al. using the \"Leeds in situ model,\" a device that allows dental plaque to develop in situ on a removable human enamel surface, have helped in the assessment of novel antimicrobial agents and take into account the extremely complex microbial composition and architecture of plaque biofilms [23] . The use of such intact biofilms on natural tooth surfaces would be of particular value to a study of the penetration of nanoparticles and released ions. This model has indicated that plaque contains voids and channels, sometimes extending completely through the biomass to the underlying enamel [24] and may have considerable influence on the transfer of nanoparticles through biofilms. The main considerations are the physical and chemical characteristics of the particular nanoparticles used, including the surface charge and degree of hydrophobicity, the surface area-to-mass ratio of the plaque biofilm and the ability of the particles to adsorb to/be taken up at the biofilm surface. Within this context, nanoparticles are potentially useful because it is possible to alter their surface charge, hydrophobicity, and other physical and chemical characteristics [25] .",

An inverse relationship between the size of nanoparticles and antimicrobial activity has been clearly demonstrated, where particles in the size range of 1\u00c010 nm have been shown to possess the greatest biocidal activity against bacteria [3, 32] . Indeed, it has been shown that smaller silver nanoparticles are more toxic than larger particles, more so when oxidized [33] .

Also, it appears that bacteria are far less likely to acquire resistance to metal nanoparticles than they are to other conventional and narrow-spectrum antibiotics [37] . This is thought to occur because metals may act on a broad range of microbial targets, and many mutations would have to occur in order for the microorganisms to resist their antimicrobial activity. Shape may also affect the activity of nanoparticles. It has been demonstrated that the shape of silver nanoparticles can influence antimicrobial activity, as has been shown in the case of Escherichia coli [37] . Truncated triangular silver nanoplates with a {111} lattice plane as the basal plane showed the greatest biocidal activity compared with spherical and rod-shaped nanoparticles.

The high reactivity of nano-titanium dioxide and nano-silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) is exploited extensively for their bactericidal properties in filters and coatings on substrates such as polymers, ceramics, glasses, and alumina [39] . Significant activity using metal and metal oxide nanoparticles and their compound clusters against fungal and bacterial pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and E. coli has recently been demonstrated. These have also shown the capability to inactivate viruses, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), H1N1 swine flu, and H5N1 bird flu. For example, new broad-spectrum materials (5\u00c060 nm) can reduce virus levels by 80\u00c0100% through direct or indirect contact. Nanoparticle preparations, including those based upon nickel (Ni, NiO), zirconium (ZrO 2 ), copper (Cu, CuO, and Cu 2 O), titanium (TiO 2 ), zinc (ZnO), aluminum (Al 2 O 3 ), silicon (IV) nitride (Si 3 N 4 ), silver (Ag), and tungsten carbide (WC) have been compared in regards to their antimicrobial potential. Significant activity with Ag, ZnO, TiO 2 (in the presence of UV light), SiO 2 , Cu, Cu 2 O, and CuO against bacterial pathogens, including MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been demonstrated [40] . MBCs were found to be in the range of 0.1\u00c05 mg/mL. In comparison, traditional antibiotics are effective at concentrations 1000-fold lower. NiO, Ni, Al 2 O 3 , TiO 2 (in the absence of UV light), Si 3 N 4 , WC (tungsten carbide), and ZrO 2 were found to lack antimicrobial activity at the concentrations tested. The oral pathogens P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, Prev. intermedia, and A. actinomycetemcomitans were also found to be susceptible to Ag and CuO nanoparticles under anaerobic conditions with MBC values in the range 0.025\u00c02.5 mg/mL [41] . The antimicrobial actions of elemental silver, Ag 1 ions, and silver compounds have been extensively investigated [4] . In comparison to other metals, silver is relatively less toxic to human cells, albeit at very low concentrations. Ag 1 ions have been considered for a range of biomedical applications, including their use within the dental field as an antibacterial component in dental resin composites [42] . Silver also exhibits a strong affinity for zeolite, a porous crystalline material of hydrated aluminosilicate which can bind up to 40% Ag 1 ions within its structure. Silver zeolite has been incorporated in tissue conditioners, acrylic resins, and mouth rinses within the dental field [43\u00c046]. Silver nanoparticles ( Figure 10 .1A), either alone or together with other antimicrobial agents, have shown particularly encouraging results [27, 47, 48] . The use of silver salt nanoparticles instead of elemental silver or complex silver compounds to prevent biofilm formation on surfaces for both biomedical and more general use has been investigated. Using silver bromide precipitation to synthesize polymer-nanocomposites, surfaces that comprised this material were shown to resist biofilm formation. It was also shown to be possible, through controlling the size of the embedded AgBr, to modify the release of biocidal Ag 1 ions [49] .",

            "text": "Surprisingly, little is known about how nanoparticles behave in relation to microorganisms, particularly at the cellular level. The mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of silver is not completely understood but is likely to involve multiple targets in comparison to the more defined targets of antibiotics. Studies have shown that the positive charge on the Ag 1 ion is critical for antimicrobial activity, allowing the electrostatic attraction between the negative charge of the bacterial cell membrane and positively charged nanoparticles [36] . In regards to molecular mechanisms of the inhibitory action of Ag 1 ions on microorganisms, it has been shown that DNA loses its ability to replicate [50] , and the expression of ribosomal subunit proteins and other cellular proteins and enzymes necessary for ATP production become inactive [51] . It has also been hypothesized that Ag 1 ions affect membrane-bound respiratory enzymes [52] . However, the precise mechanism(s) of biocidal activity of silver nanoparticles against bacteria remains to be fully elucidated. The work of Sondi and Salopek-Sondi [27] demonstrated structural changes and damage to bacterial membranes resulting in cell death. These particular studies suggest that sulfur-containing proteins in the membrane or inside the cells and phosphorus-containing elements, such as DNA, are likely to be the preferential binding sites for silver nanoparticles. The contribution of Ag 1 ion release from nanoparticles to the overall antimicrobial activity remains unclear. It is suggested that a bacterial cell in contact with silver nanoparticles will take up Ag 1 ions, which possibly in turn will inhibit respiratory enzymes and so help to generate free radicals and subsequent free-radical-induced damage to the cell membrane. In order to determine the relationship between free-radical formation and antimicrobial activity, the use of antioxidants does suggest that free radicals may be derived from the surface of silver nanoparticles [36] .",

The bactericidal effect of the nanoparticles was compared using disc diffusion tests and MIC and MBC determinations. Bacterial sensitivity was found to differ according to the species tested and the test system employed. For all strains of S. aureus and E. coli, the action of silver nanoparticles was found to be superior. Strainspecific variation for S. aureus was negligible, while some strain-specific variation was observed for E. coli. A higher sensitivity, as shown with B. subtilis, may be attributed to more amine and carboxyl groups (in comparison to other species) on the cell surface; these groups having a greater affinity for copper [55] . Released copper ions within the cell may then disrupt nucleic acid and key enzymes [56] . In theory, a combination of silver and copper nanoparticles may give rise to a more complete bactericidal effect, especially against a mixed population of bacteria. Indeed, the studies of Ren et al. [40] demonstrated that populations of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria could be reduced by 68% and 65%, respectively, in the presence of 1.0 mg/mL nanocopper oxide within 2 h. This was significantly increased to 88% and 100%, respectively, with the addition of a relatively low concentration (0.05 mg/mL) of nanosilver.",

Apart from the possible adverse effects on the mechanical properties of the composite, difficulties in controlling the release of such agents may be a potential drawback. QA-PEI nanoparticles at a concentration of 1% w/w enabled complete in vitro growth inhibition of S. mutans to be achieved for at least 3 months [78] . The proposed mechanism of action of QA-PEI is suggested to be as a result of transfusion across, and damage to, the bacterial cell wall. The hydrophobic nature and positive charge of these particles are also thought to further enhance the antimicrobial activity. Surface chemical analysis of the restorative composite embedded with QA-PEI demonstrated a surface modification of higher hydrophobicity and the presence of quaternary amines when compared to the unmodified material. Further studies to optimize the release characteristics of QA-PEI and other potentially useful nanoparticulates from dental materials will be required.",

As a result of interaction with calcium binding sites and the masking of bacterial receptors on salivary molecules, CPP\u00c0ACP is thought to reduce bacterial colonization as shown with CPP\u00c0ACP germanium treated surfaces [90] .",

This approach is now being utilized within the clinical setting in some countries. The killing of microorganisms with light depends upon cytotoxic singlet oxygen and free-radical generation by the excitation of a photoactivatable agent or sensitizer. The result of excitation is that the sensitizer moves from an electronic ground state to a triplet state which then interacts with microbial components to generate cytotoxic species [96] . One of the advantages of light-activated killing is that the resistance to action of singlet oxygen is unlikely to become widespread in comparison to that experienced with more traditional chemical antimicrobial agents. A sensitizer ideally should absorb light at red to near-infrared wavelengths because these wavelengths are able to penetrate more. The most commonly tested sensitizers on bacteria are tricyclic dyes (e.g., methylene blue and erythrosine), tetrapyrroles (e.g., porphyrins), and furocoumarins (e.g., psoralen). The use of nanoparticles within this area is now under investigation. For example, a complex of biodegradable and biocompatible poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and colloidal gold nanoparticles, loaded with methylene blue and exposed to red light at 665 nm, have been tested against planktonic E. faecalis and in experimentally infected root canals [97] . In theory, gold nanoparticle conjugates should have improved binding and cell wall penetration properties, and so should deliver a higher concentration of photoactive molecules. It remains to be fully established whether such conjugates will show an increased antibacterial activity when compared to more conventional treatments.",

The photosensitizer erythrosine has an advantage over other dyes because it is currently used in dentistry to visualize dental plaque in vivo, and so its lack of toxicity in the host is well established. For use in periodontitis, the dye needs to be applied subgingivally prior to fiber-optic laser light activation. However, when disease is present, the periodontal site has a marked flow of GCF into the pocket, and most photosensitizers lose some activity in the presence of extraneous protein. Also, some have virtually no effect in the presence of saliva and other body fluids. This is because the agents complex with proteins and host cells in the GCF and effectively compete for binding to bacteria. The use of nanoparticles as applied to PDT may help to overcome some of the issues associated with serum constituents.",

Whereas it is well known that copper in a non-nanoparticulate form is actively excreted from the body, non-nanoparticulate silver can accumulate within the body. However, the threat posed by these metals in a nanoparticulate form is far from clear [99] . In order to understand the mechanism of toxicity, a thorough knowledge of the toxicokinetic properties of nanoparticles is required. This includes information on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of nanoparticles [100] . In theory, certain nanoparticles may be retained within the body for longer than the desirable time, and thus the safety profile becomes a matter of overriding significance. Nanomaterials are able to cross biological membranes and access cells, tissues, and organs that larger-sized particles normally cannot. Nanomaterials can enter the blood stream following inhalation or ingestion, and some can even penetrate the skin. In vitro studies with lung epithelial cells, enterocytes, and skin keratinocytes indicate marked differences in susceptibility to metallic nanoparticles according to cell type tested (R.P. Allaker and M.A. Vargas-Reus, unpublished observations). However, a particle's surface chemistry, which in some cases can be modified, can govern whether it should be considered further for biomedical applications [25] .",

Antiadherent and antifungal effects were shown using buccal epithelial cells treated with nondrug-loaded poly(ethylcyanoacrylate) nanoparticles. Nanoparticles were prepared using emulsion polymerization and stabilized with cationic, anionic, or nonionic surfactants. Cationic surfactants, for example, cetrimide, which are known antimicrobial agents, were the most effective in reducing C. albicans blastospore adhesion, and showed a growth inhibitory and biocidal effect against the yeast. Production of nanoparticles with an anionic surfactant gave lower yields and wide particle-size distributions. No evidence of killing against C. albicans was shown. Nonionic surfactant-coated nanoparticles produced intermediate kill rates. These studies clearly demonstrate the importance of surface charge on the nanoparticle surface. It is suggested that the buccal epithelium could possibly be treated using polymeric-type nanoparticles in a mouthwash-type formulation; in theory, this would prime the potential target cells against adhesion and infection.",

Larger, more hydrophobic or poorly dispersed particles, which would be rapidly removed by the reticuloendothelial system, were shown to be less toxic. Karlsson et al.

Toxic effects on cultured cells were assessed using trypan blue staining, the comet assay to measure DNA damage and an oxidation-sensitive fluoroprobe to quantify the production of ROS [60] . Copper oxide was found to be the most toxic and therefore may pose the greatest health risk.

Their use as constituents of prosthetic device coatings, topically applied agents, and within dental materials is currently being explored. Future developments are likely to concentrate on those nanoparticles with maximal antimicrobial activity and minimal host toxicity. Antimicrobial nanoparticulate metals have received particular attention as a result of their durability. Although certain nanoparticles may be toxic to oral and other tissues, the surface characteristics of a given particle will help to determine whether or not it will have potential for oral applications. Approaches to alter biocompatibility and desired function are now being identified and these include changing the ability to aggregate, application of surface coatings, and altering oxidative state and charge density.
