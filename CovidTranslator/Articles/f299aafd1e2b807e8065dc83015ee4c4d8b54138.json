ICT is constantly evolving along with the associated criminality, including cloud computing crime. In addition, certain types of online activities considered to be \"Internet\" or \"cloud computing\" crime in some countries are not considered as such in others. For example, in most Western common law countries, if a female posts topless beach holiday \"selfies\" on Facebook via a smart mobile phone to share among friends, the act would be considered a harmless private activity. In many Muslim countries, and certainly those in the Middle East, however, the act would be considered a criminal offense; the woman would be subject to criminal prosecution in court and the act would be punishable by public lashing. Both polity and invested interests are at play, and the novelty of the \"risk\" or \"threat\" posed by new forms of technology-associated crimes can be used to support a larger share of government funding.",

The popularity of smaller mobile computing devices such as smart phones, which have resulted from advancements in Internet technologies, has been combined with the nature of cloud computing, which provides faster, easier access to files in remote locations, to allow users to access and update files on the move. Although cloud computing technologies offer efficiency in terms of users' hardware requirements and access barriers, they also create challenges for both law enforcement authorities and individuals alike. One such issue is the policing of computer-related crime, which involves gathering evidence from, storing data in, the cloud, and then prosecuting the perpetrator. Scholars have drawn attention to some of these issues, but the socio-legal perspective treated here has not received much attention in the literature to date. Policing priority is typically set by country or place individually according to their needs. Factors affecting policing include the economy, legal traditions, police structure and organization, cultural factors, and political structure. The protection of these factors and their perceived importance is different in each jurisdiction and under each government in power, and thus policing varies accordingly.",

The level of policing for the Internetwork is also different, as each country prompts different government perceptions of its level of technology risk or economic threat. These perceptions are largely dependent on the level of technology each country relies on to generate wealth, and sometimes on how much a given government sees technology as a threat to its political structure and systems.

The technique of virtualization in cloud computing has created an economy of scale, such that services are only provided when there is consumer demand. This allows service providers to reduce their materials and service costs. On one hand, almost all smart phone devices now allow users to constantly connect with the Internetwork on the go; anytime, anywhere. On the other hand, to enhance the user's smart mobile phone experience, service providers must design their services based on users' needs. This can result in compromised safe-guards and security, which in turn create opportunities for criminal activity, and authorities have yet to catch up to these technologies, especially when perpetrators can be located overseas or in different police jurisdictions.",

The device was low-tech and could be bought cheaply in the Sham Shui Po electronics market. But it was the first time police had seen it used in this kind of crime. 9 In Singapore, for example, according to a report released by WebSynergies, 10 there have been a million Singaporean cybercrime victims. The report estimated a total of US$1 billion lost through cybercrime over the period of a year. Smart mobile phones have become the tool of choice for cybercriminals in Singapore, as viruses can migrate from Personal Computers (PCs) to mobile devices. The incidence of related petty crimes such as smart phone snatching has also risen. In another example from Singapore, Channel News Asia 11 interviewed an Inspector of the Singapore Police. During the live interview, conducted on April 23, 2014, the Inspector described a smart mobile phone crime case involving a woman in her late 40s who was an accountant by profession. She allegedly befriended a male who claimed to be a pilot for Singapore Airline. They met and chatted on Whatsapp 12 through their smart phones for some time, and ultimately agreed to meet face-to-face in a caf\u00e9 near the Singapore International Airport. The supposed pilot told the woman that he had been in a hurry to get out of his flat and had forgotten to bring enough Euros with him. He asked the woman if she would transfer 2000 Singapore dollars to a certain bank account under his name, so that when he landed in Germany the next day he could withdraw the cash from an ATM. He promised to repay her in a week's time, when he returned. The woman agreed and transferred the money via her smart phone. For some time, she did not hear from the man and could not contact him on Whatsapp. After 4 months she reported him to the police. The man was eventually arrested wearing a pilot's uniform near the international airport, in a sting operation mounted by the police after a few more women fell victim to his scam and reported him.",

The term was only coined in the late 2000s. Victims of cloud computing crime might not even realize their status as such, or they may choose not to report it, as the police are sometimes unable to recognize it as such and instead record it as traditional street crime. Even when the police recognize and record an event as cloud computing crime, they may have difficulty following up, especially if the servers and data involved are located overseas or in multiple jurisdictions. As Quick et al. explain, \"the key component of cloud computing is multi-tenancy capability, which is referred to as a shared pool of resources . . . individual files may be distributed across multiple disks and storage systems across multiple jurisdictions.\" 13 Securing and preserving a chain of evidence for prosecution in court involves significant police resources, and even if the culprit is deported to face justice, the case may not pass the prosecution's test of public interest and the perpetrator could escape justice.",

In the intermittent period between the 1950s and the early 1980s, Hong Kong was labeled a sweat-shop for the world's light manufactured goods, but with the open-door policy introduced by Communist China in 1978, Hong Kong industrialization came to an abrupt end in the early 1980s. Almost all of the manufacturing factories were moved northward across the border to Shenzhen City or beyond in mainland China, due to cheaper wages and land. By this time, Hong Kong was beginning to establish itself as a financial center and professional services hub, largely serving the booming mainland China economy supported by the open-door policy and the growth of the Asian economy. By the beginning of the twenty-first century, Hong Kong had become well established as the fourth largest global financial and banking center in the region.

Some events have been cause for concern in Hong Kong. For example, Beijing interpreted the Basic Law (the mini constitutional law of Hong Kong) in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but the major clash between Beijing and Hong Kong over the rule of law occurred in 2003, when Beijing instructed Hong Kong's government to introduce Article 23 into the Basic Law to regulate subversion. Article 23 is similar to the national security laws in many Western countries, but the very idea of such a law was new to postcolonial Hong Kong, and given the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government's track record, it sent chills down the spines of many in Hong Kong. The legislative process for Article 23 triggered a mass public outcry, with over half a million people protesting in the streets against the legislation. Eventually, Hong Kong's government put the National Security Bill on hold indefinitely, temporarily shielding the rule of law in Hong Kong from being \"mainlandized.\" However, the \"mainlandization\" of Hong Kong has accelerated, especially since 2003, after a series of crises including the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the avian flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks. These crises prompted Hong Kong to actively seek help from the mainland and push for greater economic integration. The Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement between mainland China and Hong Kong is a case in point. Politically, it is in Beijing's interest to help Hong Kong, as it would be seen as a failure for Beijing if Hong Kong failed only a few years after reintegration. These factors have helped to accelerate the pace of Hong Kong's integration with the mainland, both politically and economically.",

This has transformed Singapore from a society once characterized by sharp contrast between ethnic groups who spoke different dialects and were separated by a large wealth gap into an affluent, English-speaking, middle-class industrialized metropolis.

One party, the People Action Party (PAP), dominates parliament.\" 22 Democracy in Singapore, however, is \"Singapore style\" or \"Asian democracy\" whereby political power is in the hands of few Singaporean elites. This \"elite governance\" or, more importantly the PAP, has been active since 1955 for almost 60 years. Decision making is largely a top-down process because there is little-tono opposition in the parliament. As Low said, \"the PAP government has viewed the economy and society as machines,\" 23 and since PAP came to power, its legitimacy has largely been gained through a strategy of social pacification and the institution of repression and redistribution. 24 However, in recent years the PAP suffered a setback in the popularity vote at the 2011 general election, only receiving 60.1%, which was down 15% from the general election in 2001.

The threat of terrorism from inside mainland China and especially from the Xinjiang region has increased, and this terrorist group is known to be quite IT savvy, often using social media to disseminate information and communicate with like-minded group members around the globe. They were said to have downloaded a video clip onto their smart mobile phones via the cloud and then watched it before carrying out their bombing attack inside mainland China. Therefore, the Hong Kong government must consider this type of threat. The increase in Muslim militant extremists represents an interregional, if not a global threat, and such militants are also known to use the electronic highway and smart mobile phones to carry out attacks and spreading ideological campaign material among themselves and other affiliated groups in Asia. Like Hong Kong, Singapore is an important international financial center, yet its economy is more diverse, with a mixture of industries such as manufacturing, 34 Ibid., p. 2. oil refinery, shipping, and biotechnology. Singapore is a democratic and a sovereign state with self-determination, even though its democratic process is regarded as a \"controlled\" democracy because the PAP has been in power since the first day of independence from Malaysia more than 50 years ago, with little or no opposition in parliament. On August 18, 2014, in a Singapore National Day speech broadcast live on Channel News Asia, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Leong said, \"Keep Singapore special in Asia\" by transforming it into \"a smart nation.\" He introduced the Singapore Smart Nation Plan and provided detailed examples of a brand new housing community to be built in Jurong Lake District. The community will feature sensor boxes connected to fiber-optic lines deployed across the community and, eventually the entire country, at street lights, or bus stops. The sensor boxes can be designed to detect air pollutants, heavy rainfall, or traffic jams, or to report how full rubbish bins are, paired with cameras that can detect litter and remind litterbugs to pick up their trash. Singapore has already laid the groundwork for the Smart Nation plan. For example, fiber Internet is available to most households in the country, with super-fast 1 Gbps service costing as little as US$50 per month.",

The government is trying to harness the power of technology to increase the economy's productivity and efficiency. Therefore, if the PAP responds and wants to increase the resources provided to the Singapore police to further increase their ability to fight the growing threat of technology-related crime, doing so will be relatively easier than it would be in many other democratic societies in Western developed economies. Singaporean voters may not necessarily agree with the PAP's decisions regarding finite public resources being transferred from other more pressing social needs, as when they voted to form the government. However, the PAP's manifesto may not mention anything about resources being earmarked for fighting technology-related crime, rather they may prefer to say that they will tackle traditional street crime and other forms of crime important to Singaporean voters.",

Other important elements are also required, such as knowledge of the cloud and the skills to find and collect electronic evidence in a live flow of data on a distribution network in the cloud, especially in a virtual machine. For example, in cloud data environments, it is often not possible to access the physical media that stores a customer's data, because cloud data are likely to be stored overseas and outside the investigating officer's jurisdiction. As Hooper et al. noted: Even if the data is stored within jurisdiction, data distribution technologies [in cloud] may split a user's data across a number (potentially thousands) of storage devices within the cloud computing environment. LEAs would need to rely upon the cloud technology and the cloud service provider to gain access to the data that is stored by a customer and this can introduce issues with chain-ofcustody best practices. 36",

Consequently, this could result in accidental modification of data as it is exported from the cloud computing environment for LEA [Law Enforcement Agency] use or intentional destruction of data by the suspect. Once the LEA has secured access to the cloud computing data, the format of the data is still not guaranteed and most of the prevalent digital forensic analysis tools have not yet been updated to decode the major cloud computing data export formats. While many IaaS data exports will likely mimic the data format that is currently supported as virtual machines, SaaS instances are more likely to use proprietary data formats and as such are unlikely to be supported by current tools 37 Finally, even if the police in Singapore and Hong Kong do increase their policing capabilities in smart mobile phone and cloud-related crime, the legal limitations 35 Gray (2013, p. 1). 36 See Hooper et al. (2013, p. 156 ). 37 Ibid. remain a key factor in whether the perpetrator faces justice for the crime they have committed. Even though Singapore has enacted an extraterritorial law, because each country has enacted their own law according to their own socio-politic, socio-economic, cultural and legal traditions, and regulatory regimes, policing priorities differ by jurisdiction. There has been good progress on harmonizing the laws in recent years (INTERPOL 24/7 mutual legal assistant, Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, etc.), but the task remains problematic due to jurisdictional issues. Both Hong Kong and Singapore will have trouble bringing an overseas perpetrator from their country of domicile to face justice for committing a cloud computing crime in Hong Kong or Singapore.",

At the domestic level, both governments in Hong Kong and in Singapore must provide sufficient financial support to the policing agencies to enable them to fight the emerging crime such as cloud and smart mobile phone crimes. Fighting technology-related crimes is an \"arms race\" which needs both money and human resources. More importantly, the government must provide training opportunities and education (including general public education to increase public awareness on emerging technologies crimes like cloud and smart mobile phone crimes and learning to cooperate with the private sector or businesses to reduce crime) for the law enforcement officers to upgrade their skills and knowledge on cloud which eventually help increase the success rate in bringing the perpetrator to face justice and punish them in court-as a deterrent to others not to commit the same offense. However, at the international level, it seems there is little that Hong Kong and Singapore can do to alter the current situation, except to participate actively within the international bodies and convention on technology-related crime, and to learn from other jurisdictions around the world on what they are doing and, at the same time, tap into latest information on cloud computing crime to get a head start in fighting the emerging technology-related crime for themselves in the region.",

They tabled a proposal to the Legislative Council and explained the rationale behind the upgrade: With increasing reliance on information and communication technology infrastructures and rising popularity of the Internet, local reports of technology crime have increased sharply by 18 times since 2002, i.e. from 272 cases in 2002 to 5 133 in 2013. The respective financial loss has also increased by almost 20 times from $45 million to $917 million over the past five years from 2009 to 2013. To enhance the Police's capability in combating technology crime, the establishment of TCD has increased from 26 posts in 2002 to the current establishment with 98 posts.",
