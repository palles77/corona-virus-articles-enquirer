For loading of the resin, the Fmoc-amino acid (10 eq. relative to resin loading) was dissolved in dry DCM [= dichloromethane] using a separate flask. DIC [= diisopropylcarbodiimide] (10 eq.) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 20 min at 0 \u00b0C. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was re-dissolved in NMP yielding an approx. 0.4 M solution of the respective amino acid. DMAP [= 4-dimethylamino-pyridine] dissolved in a minimum S3 of NMP (0.1 eq. relative to resin loading) was added and the reaction mixture was immediately transferred to the resin. During loading reaction the syringe containing the loading mixture was vigorously shaken for 1 h. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was filtered and the resin was thoroughly washed with NMP. The loading procedure was repeated one or two times, depending on the estimated loading density. The resin loading was estimated via UV analysis of the dibenzofulven concentration resulting from Fmocdeprotection. Therefore, the particular resin (5 mg) was placed in a graduated flask (10 mL) and DBU [= 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4 .0]undec-7-en] in NMP (2% solution) was added. After gently shaking for 1 h, while the resin should always be covered by the deprotection solution, the reaction mixture was diluted with acetonitrile to 10 mL. The solution was further diluted with acetonitrile (1/12.5) and transferred to a UV cell (1 cm \uf0b4 1 cm). The absorption of the cleaved Fmoc species was detected at 304 nm (\u03b5 304 = 7624 L mol -1 \uf0d7cm -1 ) (Gude et al. 2002) .",

In case of the synchrotron data the diffuse scattering (A/B, red data points) data were used for determination of the respective electron density profiles (D). The respective difference curves (blue curves) were multiplied by a factor of three.S13",
