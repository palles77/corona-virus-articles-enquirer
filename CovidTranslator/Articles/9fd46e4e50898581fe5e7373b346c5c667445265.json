However, the ICs0 values obtained must also be considered in the context of the pharmacokinetic and toxicologic properties of the drugs tested, and the activity of PCV against CMV should be further investigated in vivo. Twelve patients with different forms of haematological malignancies underwent autologous (n = 6) or allogeneic (n = 6) BMT were tested. The materials (blood sera and nasal swabs) were collected each 2 weeks during 6 months in pre-and post-transplantation period. Nasal swabs were washed with l ml PBS and the material was subjected to sedimentation. The sedimented nasal epithelium cells were used for direct immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy, which was performed with fluorescein-conjugated antibodies (Abs) to respiratory viruses and Mycoplatma pneumoniae (Mp). The supernatant was used for detection of mucosal Abs. The detection of these Abs as well as Abs in blood sera was performed in Indirect Haemagglutination Test (IHA) with viral (Injuenra fypes 1, 2 and 3, Adenovinrs, Rezpirntory syn6tial virus, Coronavincc) and Mp antigens. Bacterial and fungal infections were diagnosed microbiologically In all 56 episodes of infection were diagnosed. In 54 of these episodes mixed Mp-viral infection was demonstrated. Twenty five (45%) episodes were detected in immunosuppressed patients during the period of profound neutropenia immediately after BMT. The clinical manifestations of invasive bacterial infections caused by Eschm'chia coli, Mebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomom amginosa were more severe 111 the episodes of preexisting respiratory viral-Mp infection. So the viral-mycoplasmal respiratory infection decreases the resistance to bacteria in immunosuppressed patients. The immune response in the patients was characterized by dramatic decrease in blood Abs level whereas the mucosal Abs changed similarly to those in immunocompetent patients. We conclude that viral-mycoplasmal infection enhances the immunodepression in immunosuppressed patients especially the general immune response rather than the local one and these infections must be caremy controlled.",

Clinally the predictive value of a characteristic nocturnal hyperhidrosis all P with CMV disease complained about was accompanied with the CD4/CD8 inversion-decrease of CD4-lymphocytes and increase of CD8-lymphocytes resulting in a ratio <1-even preceding acute organ deterioration. The degree of inversion reflected severity of CMV disease course and the diagnostic value of this parameter was not impaired even in P on monoclonal antibodies. Consequent virustatic therapy contributed to improvement of transplant function with decrease of serum-creatinine &om 3.2 f 1.2 to 1.6 f 0.5 mg/dl.

PCR-based detection of CMV DNA in blood specimens permits recognition of CMV infection at an early stage. We studied 20 patients (pa) during the first 3 months after RTx who were CMV-seropositive before RTx (18 pts) or seronegative with a seropositive kidney donor (2 pts). The CMV-specific CTL response in peripheral blood was assessed at 1, 2, and 3 months after RTx. Blood mononuclear cells were co-cultured with CMV-infected autologous fibroblasts for 2 weeks, and then tested by C?'-release assay for cytotoxicity against CMV-infected or d e c t e d autologous or HLA-mismatched fibroblasts. The PCR was used for detection of CMV DNA in blood leukocytes once a week. The assay was considered positive if 2 2 consecutive blood specimens were PCR-positive.",

Subjects randomly received one dose of one of three licensed Hib-conjugate vaccines (Connaught, Merdc or Lederle). HIV RNA copy number was determined by RT-PCR using the HIV Monitor assay (Roche). CD4 counts and p24 assays (Couker) were also performed. Samples were analyzed pre-immunization (baseline) and one month post-immunization. We had 90% power to detect a 1.23 log rise in RNA copy number. Results: 38/53 (72%) of those enrolled were receiving anti-retroviral therapy",
