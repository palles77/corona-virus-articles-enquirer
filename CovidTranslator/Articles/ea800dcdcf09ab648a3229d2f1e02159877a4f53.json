HNSCC can be broadly divided into human papillomavirus (HPV)negative cancers and HPV-positive cancers where HPV is the causative agent. Previous studies in FOSCC have used both species-specific and species-nonspecific PCR primers that may be insensitive to the detection of PVs and other viruses that may be divergent from known sequences. ViroCap is a targeted capture and next generation sequencing tool that was designed to identify all known vertebrate DNA and RNA viruses. In this study we used a metagenomic approach using ViroCap for DNA viruses in 20 FOSCC, 9 normal feline oral mucosal, and 8 suspected PV positive control samples. We tested the hypothesis that viruses would be enriched in FOSCC compared to normal oral mucosa. The virome of the FOSCC and normal feline oral mucosa consisted of feline foamy virus in 7/20 and 2/9 (35% and 22%), feline torque teno virus in 2/20 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), alphaherpesvirus in 2/10 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), FIV (0% and 22%), Epstein-Barr virus in 1/20 and 0/9 (5% and 0%) and feline papillomavirus in 1/20 and 0/9 samples (5% and 0% respectively). Felis catus papillomavirus-3 was found in 1 of 20 FOSCC samples. A virus was not associated consistently with FOSCC. If PVs have a role in FOSCC it is at most a supplementary or uncommon role. FOSCC appears most closely related to HPV-negative HNSCC. Future research on FOSCC should focus on identifying genetic and environmental causes. (S. Chu).

            "text": "Feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (FOSCC) is the 4 th most common feline neoplasm and there is no effective treatment for this disease. FOSCC has commonly been proposed as the best model for human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). HNSCC can be divided into human papillomavirus (HPV) positive and HPV-negative cancers. The largest papillomavirus (PV) genera is the alpha-PVs, which includes subtypes HPV-16 and 18 that have the highest malignant transformation potential. PVs are non-enveloped circular doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses with 5 or 6 early (E1, E2, E4, +/-E5, E6, E7) genes and two late genes (L1 and L2). All PVs contain a highly conserved L1 gene and thus family-specific consensus PCR primers can be used to amplify a region in this gene. There are currently only 5 Felis catus PV (FcaPV) species known to infect domestic cats. FcaPV DNA, especially FcaPV-2, and induced changes in cell regulation (increased p16 identified by IHC staining) have been detected in the majority of BISCs, Supplementary Table 1 (Lange et al., 2009; Munday, 2014; Munday et al., 2007) . PV DNA and increased p16 have also been detected in 75% of UV-protected cutaneous SCC, and thus PV is likely a causative agent in feline BISCs and UV-protected cutaneous SCC, Supplementary Table 1 (Munday, 2014; Munday et al., 2011a) . Previous studies have used either PV consensus PCR primers or PV type specific PCR primers and have not found strong evidence to support a viral etiology, Supplementary Table 2. In summary, to date PV has only been found in 6 of 177 FOSCC samples in peer-reviewed journals and the association between PV and FOSCC thus remains weak. Contrary to these previous studies, an abstract presented at the 2015 Veterinary Cancer Society (VCS) conference detected PV with consensus PCR primers in all of the 12 FOSCC samples that were evaluated (Skor, 2015) .",

Amplicon-based survey sequencing approaches, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing, have been utilized to study bacterial diversity, but a similar method cannot be used for viruses due to the lack of universally conserved genes. ViroCap, a hybridization-based capture and NGS approach, has the ability to enrich nucleic acids from all currently known DNA and RNA viruses from vertebrate hosts (excluding endogenous retroviruses) for which probes are included (Wylie et al., 2015) . Compared to PCR, ViroCap can detect viruses that are divergent from reference genome sequences (e.g. anellovirus family), and it has the ability to generate complete or nearly complete genome sequences because probes are tiled across the full length of the genomes. ViroCap has been utilized on human vaginal swabs (Wylie et al., 2018b) , whole blood, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, nasopharyngeal swabs, tracheal aspirates, skin swabs, and stool (Wylie et al., 2018a (Wylie et al., , 2015 and in a Coronavirus outbreak in Canada Geese (Papineau et al., 2019) . To the author's knowledge, the current study would be the first companion animal study to utilize a targeted capture and NGS strategy to study the virome. ViroCap is the most definitive method used to date to characterize the virome of the oral mucosa of cats and to find a viral cause of FOSCC.",

Average genomic coverage (depth of coverage or DoC) was estimated from base representation by the extracted, deduplicated and aligned reads for each base of the genome. Breadth of coverage (BoC) was estimated in SAMtools and was defined as the percent of bases of the reference viral genome that was covered by sequence reads at a level of 5x or higher. The detection of false positives (e.g. by index swapping or contamination from sample handling) were minimized with the definition of strict coverage criteria.

PV2 was a papilloma on the skin of a dog and contained CPV-6 by ViroCap. PV2 was negative on PCR. Even though the FAP59/64 primers were created for cutaneous adapted PVs, they have never been shown to amplify CPV-6 and this may explain PCR failure. The 1 FOSCC sample that had PV, OSCC8, had a high viral read count, > 2.1 million reads, with feline PV (FcaPV-3), likely indicative of a true infection. A normal mucosal sample, N6, had a very low PV read count, 56 reads, with a human PV (HPV-28) and likely represented contamination (Supplementary Table 5 , Supplementary Fig. 2) . PV was not detected by any method for the following positive control samples, PV1, PV6, PV7 and PV8 (Supplementary Table 4 ). These samples were from feline lesions that were diagnosed as sarcoids (fibropapillomas) and oral papillomas via histopathology with hematoxylin and eosin staining. Five novel variants of PV were discovered with ViroCap (Table 2, Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 6 , and Supplementary Figures 3-6 ). GenBank accessions for the new variants are KY802017, KY825186, KY825187, KY825188, and KY886226. All SNPs in the L1 gene in the novel variants were synonymous. The full list of variants can be found in Supplementary  Table 7 . For the 5 novel PV variants, the reads that aligned to the ends of the reference genome contained overhangs that mapped to the other end of the genome. This is consistent with a circularized virus and maintenance of the virus as an episome.",

BLAST of representative aligned reads were a match only to the Marek's disease viruses (MDV-2 and MDV-3) that infect chickens. This sample also contained avian leucosis virus (ALV). To determine if these avian viruses were present as a contaminant from chicken tissues, all of the sequenced reads from OSCC13 were aligned to the Gallus gallus genome (Galgal4). OSCC13 had 98,146 reads (deduplicated with a mapping quality of \u226560) that mapped to Galgal4 with a BoC of 0.011%.

            "text": "This is the first study to use a comprehensive capture approach to characterize the virome of the oral mucosa of domestic cats. To demonstrate that PV causes FOSCC, ideally all 3 of the following criteria would be met: (1) PV DNA in the lesion, (2) expression of oncogenes such as E6 and E7, (3) disruption of tumor suppressor gene, TP53 and RB1, function by viral oncoproteins. The first criterion was specifically evaluated in this study and was not met. FcaPV was only detected in 1 of 20 FOSCC samples. These results are consistent with all published literature that includes > 1 FOSCC patient, where PV infection was detected in only 0-6.9% of patients (Munday and French, 2015; Munday et al., 2019 Munday et al., , 2009 Munday et al., 2011b; O'Neill et al., 2011; Supsavhad et al., 2016; Yamashita-Kawanishi et al., 2018) . It is possible that PV was not detected but causes FOSCC via a 'hit and run' mechanism, where E6 and E7 contribute to tumor initiation, the virus is lost in overt neoplasms, and it is not required to maintain the transformed phenotype. The hit and run hypothesis is unlikely in FOSCC due to the rarity of detecting FcaPV in FOSCC and in the oral mucosa of cats, lack of in vivo evidence that FcaPV causes premalignant changes in the oral mucosa, and the fact that PV is usually detectable with sensitive methods such as NGS in HNSCC lesions that have a genetic signature consistent with PV induced lesions (Parfenov et al., 2014) . The only PV virus that was isolated from a FOSCC lesion was FcaPV-3. FcaPV-3 is not as commonly isolated as FcaPV-2 in cats (Supplementary Table 1 ). FcaPV-3 infection has been found in cutaneous SCC, nasal planum SCCs and BISC lesions (Munday et al., 2013a (Munday et al., , 2016 Munday et al., 2013b, a; Yamashita-Kawanishi et al., 2018) . FcaPV-3 could have been an incidental infection. The authors plan to further investigate PV as a cause of FOSCC in patient OSCC8 by demonstrating evidence of criteria 2 and 3 through analysis of expression of oncogenes and interaction with host tumor suppressor genes in a future study. Increased expression of p16, E6 and E7 and decreased expression of pRb and p53 would be expected in high-risk PV induced lesions. Decreased p53 and pRB expression and increased p16 expression was found in only 2.3% of FOSCC samples and all samples with high p16 expression were negative for PV (Supsavhad et al., 2016) . Increased p16 expression has been identified as a positive prognostic factor in FOSCC but has only been seen in a minority of samples, 6.7% to 19%, and has not been associated with PV infection (Munday et al., 2019 (Munday et al., , 2011b . High-risk PVs encode an E6 protein that binds to p53 sufficiently to induce ubiquitin proteolysis (Faraji et al., 2017) . E7 similarly induces pRb degradation. However, E7 of FcaPV-3 is not expected to behave like in high-risk HPVs. The critical cysteine amino acid in the LXCXE motif on E7, that is conserved in HPV-16, FcaPV-1 and FcaPV-2, and which is responsible for pRb binding, was not present in FcaPV-3 (Supplementary Figure 14) . FcaPV-3 either does not bind to pRb and cause its degradation or binds pRb in a yet to be discovered novel mechanism.",

            "text": "There is thus currently no evidence that PV is associated with changes in oncoproteins or tumor suppressor proteins in FOSCC analogous to high-risk HPVs. Three other characteristics of FOSCC decrease the likelihood that FOSCC is a good model for high-risk PV induced SCC in people: (1) PV was maintained as a full-length episome compared to integration into the host genome in high-risk HPVs (Cancer Genome Atlas, 2015; Faraji et al., 2017; Parfenov et al., 2014) ; (2) FOSCC is almost exclusively a cancer of geriatric patients in contrast to PV-positive HNSCC being most prevalent in younger patients compared to carcinogen induced HNSCC; (3) FOSCC most commonly occurs in the oral cavity proper compared to HPV-positive tumors that are the most common in the oropharynx (e.g. tonsils) (Kang et al., 2015) . There were no tonsillar FOSCC lesions included in this study, due to the rarity of this lesion at the MU VMTH. None of the PV-positive FOSCC lesions from previous studies were classified as oropharyngeal (Supplementary  Table 2 ). To the author's knowledge PV status of oropharyngeal FOSCC has been evaluated in only 15 cats to date (Munday and French, 2015; Munday et al., 2019 Munday et al., , 2009 Munday et al., 2011b; O'Neill et al., 2011) . Tonsillar FOSCC lesions have been associated with a better prognosis, than FOSCC lesions located in the oral cavity, when treated with an accelerated radiation therapy and carboplatin protocol (Fidel et al., 2011) . If there is a feline correlate with HPV-positive OPSCC, tonsillar FOSCC would likely be the best candidate. Non-viral causes of FOSCC may include age, microbiota, genetics and exposure to carcinogens which can affect the oral cavity via ingestion or grooming. Carcinogenic agents in HNSCC commonly cause oxidative damage (Altieri et al., 2004; Freedman et al., 2007; Guha et al., 2014) . Future studies on the etiology of FOSCC should focus on carcinogen exposure. PV was also not found in some lesions that commonly have a PV cause. Based on these results, it appears that at least a portion of histologically diagnosed feline sarcoids and oral papillomas are not virally induced and histology alone may be insufficient to diagnose these lesions. Foamy viruses are continuously shed from the oral mucosa in infected cats and it was the most prevalent virus in normal and FOSCC oral mucosa. A prevalence of 36% was seen in homeless cats from South Australia (Winkler et al., 1998) , similar to the 30% observed in this study. Foamy viruses have been used in gene therapy due to their preferential integration into transcriptionally inactive regions and resulting apparent lack of association with clinical disease. Torque teno virus was the second most prevalent virus but was detected at very low coverage. Anelloviruses have been detected in cat feces, saliva and serum (Jarosova et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014) . Anelloviruses are not known to be pathogenic in cats and pathogenicity in other species is controversial with the exception of chicken anemia virus and porcine circovirus, which are closely related to anelloviruses. Prevalence in feline serum of 12.5-43% has been seen worldwide, which is similar to the suspected prevalence in this study (Jarosova et al., 2015; Okamoto et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2011) . To confirm the suspected higher prevalence a targeted PCR approach could be done. Studies evaluating FHV-1 with PCR in conjunctival and gingival samples of clinical and non-clinical cats reported that only 1-6% cats were positive for FHV-1 (Sjodahl-Essen et al., 2008) . In the current study, a similarly low prevalence of 6% was found. EBV was detected at low levels in a cat with FOSCC and concurrent FcaPV-3 infection. Contamination was deemed an unlikely source since EBV is shed via human saliva, plasma and blood and personal protective equipment was worn during surgery or necropsy. Cross contamination was unlikely since the MU VMDL does not process human samples. The oral mucosal sampling route used in this study would have been appropriate for detection of an active EBV infection since EBV replicates in the B-lymphocytes and epithelial cells in the oropharynx and is transmitted via oral secretions. EBV or an EBVlike virus has been detected previously in cats with serology (Milman et al., 2011) . False positives due to cross-reactivity with other herpes viruses are possible with serology (Heller et al., 1982; Milman et al., 2011) . The presence of circulating EBV DNA in the blood pre and post treatment and antibody titers have been shown to be independent negative prognostic indicators in nasopharyngeal carcinomas (Kang et al., 2015) . EBV infection has also been shown to increase the risk of HOSCC (She et al., 2017) . This is the first study to find EBV DNA in a feline tumor. The SNAP FeLV positive but ViroCap exFeLV negative cat could have been a false positive since a confirmatory test was not done and the screening test was not repeated. Alternatively, if N2 was truly Alternatively, fresh frozen oral mucosal tissue with cDNA conversion would be a more suitable methodology since both of these viruses are shed in the saliva during active infection. One sample, OSCC13, contained two chicken viruses, GaHV-3 and ALV. GaHV-3 also known as MDV-2, is not oncogenic in chickens, and is used in the bivalent vaccine for protection against Marek's disease (MDV-1). It is likely that this sample was contaminated with materials from chickens during sample preparation. Similarly, PV3 contained an adenovirus possibly from contamination from turkeys and OSCC4, OSCC10, OSCC19 and OSCC20 contained retrovirus possibly from contamination from sheep. HPV-28 causes benign flat plane warts in humans and was likely present in N6 due to contamination from sample handling. Forensic studies have shown that wiping down surfaces with ethanol are not sufficient to remove contamination. In future studies, where sensitive genomic work is involved cleaning techniques with a dilute (0.9-6%) hypochlorite solution or commercial decontamination solution should be requested.",

A future metagenomic study that includes cDNA conversion would be required to completely rule out a viral cause of FOSCC, but RNA viruses would be considered a highly unlikely cause of FOSCC since a non-integrated RNA virus has not caused oral squamous cell carcinoma in any species to date. Another limitation is that differences in the tissue sample preparation methods could have led to a higher viral capture efficiency in the fresh frozen negative control samples compared to the FFPE positive control and FOSCC samples. Ideally future studies should utilize fresh frozen samples and include a larger number of samples.",
