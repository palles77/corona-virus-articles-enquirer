Previous reports showed that HIV-1 protease inhibitors could block SARS-CoV main protease. Based on that and using an in silico approach, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 main protease as a target for HIV-1 protease inhibitors to reveal the structural features related to their antiviral effect. Our results showed that several HIV inhibitors such as lopinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir produce strong interaction with the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Furthermore, broad library protease inhibitors obtained from PubChem and ZINC (www.zinc.docking.org) were evaluated. Our analysis revealed 20 compounds that could be clustered into three groups based on their chemical features. Then, these structures could serve as leading compounds to develop a series of derivatives optimizing their activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Altogether, the results presented in this work contribute to gain a deep understanding of the molecular pharmacology of SARS-CoV-2 treatment and validate the use of protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "At present there is not specific treatment for coronavirus infection. However, prior outbreaks have helped to decipher the main pharmacological targets in these viruses. The therapies have been focused on targeting protease, helicase, polymerase, and using immunomodulators such as interferons and corticosteroids (Zumla et al., 2016) . Ribavi-rin alone or combined with IFN has been the most common therapeutic intervention in patients with SARS and MERS (Khalid et al., 2015) . Also, protease inhibitors have been used in vitro and in vivo to block coronavirus replication. Lopinavir (LPV) and ritonavir (RTV) are protease inhibitors currently used in HIV therapy that could block SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV main proteases (Savarino 2005) . The combination of lopinavir or ri-tonavir with ribavirin was associated with improvement in clinical outcome, compared with ribavirin alone, in SARS-CoV-infected patients (Lai, 2005) . During the MERS-CoV outbreak, the Food and Drugs Administration approved the use of ritonavir/lopinavir, based mainly on data obtained from in vitro studies (Sheahan et al 2020) . Altogether, these data support the assumption that some protease inhibitors may have an antiviral effect by blocking coronavirus main protease. However, like other RNA viruses, the main challenge associated with antiviral therapy is the selection of resistant variants. Mechanisms of generation of diversity in coronavirus are related to a moderate error rate of the polymerase (with proof-reading capacity) and homologous or heterologous recombination, factors that lead to antigenic drift and shift, similar to those described for Influenza viruses (Menachery et al., 2017) . Thus, viral replication will produce a diverse population of genome variants having different fitness profiles. These variants could be associated with the development of drug resistance (Yin and Wunderink, 2018; Pruijssers and Denison, 2019) . The ongoing efforts toward discovering efficient drugs to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection should include the prior structural and pharmacological knowledge gained with the other coronavirus outbreaks. Based on that, in this work was established a comparative theoretical study to rationalize the potential use of protease inhibitors as a treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

The PDB files to be used under further computational analysis were optimized by removing cocrystallized molecules and all crystallographic water molecules. Hydrogens were added and partial charges were assigned to all atoms. The obtained PDB files for each protein were further submitted to restrained molecular mechanics refinement. All molecular dynamics simulations described in this study were performed with NAMD 2.12 (Phillips et al., 2005) , Vega ZZ 3.1.0.21 (Pedretti et al., 2004; Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2010) as described in Ortega et al. (2019) . Following, structural analysis of the binding pocket was developed by using CASTp 3.0 software using the http://sts.bioe.uic.edu/castp/ server. The ligand-binding pocket located in the catalytic site was obtained manually and then verified by a priori docking approach with lopinavir by using the Achilles Blind Docking server (S\u00e1nchez-Linares et al., 2012) . The 3D structure of each inhibitor was obtained from PubChem. Also, public libraries for protease inhibitors were obtained from PubChem and ZINC databases. Molecular docking was performed with VINA/VegaZZ 3.1.0.21 and 30 runs conducted for each compound. The results were prioritized according to the predicted binding energy in kcal/mol. The results obtained from the docking simulation were visualized with the Biovia Discovery Studio Visualizer 17.2.0 software.",

After molecular docking, compounds were prioritized based on binding energies. The top 20 compounds were clustered using a hierarchical matrix and represented into a heat map ( Figure 5 ). These compounds could be clustered into three big groups based on their chemical structures. Also, the binding energies and chemical motives for each compound are shown in Table 2 . Interestingly, in the output of this virtual screening at least 5 compounds, representatives of these chemical clusters with binding energy around -8.2 Kcal/mol, were obtained. These scaffolds could be used as leading compounds to fur-ther chemical optimization to develop more potent inhibitors. The structure and main ADME parameters for each inhibitor are shown in Figure 6 , in general the 5 compounds shown, have physicochemical parameters under the expected values for a good drug.",

            "text": "Due to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, affecting more than 70 countries, therapeutic alternatives are urgently required. Viral main protease plays a pivotal role in coronavirus replication. This enzyme is responsible for the cleavage of the polyprotein, producing functional proteins that will be packed into the virion. The molecular study of SARS-CoV-2 protease showed that this virus has high homology with SARS-CoV protease. Previous data suggest the use of protease inhibitors as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV protease, in special some of those used for HIV-1 therapy. HIV-1 protease is an aspartyl protease, while in coronavirus it is a cysteine protease. However, the inhibition by protease inhibitors could be driven by a similar mechanism. HIV-1 is one of the best-studied models in antiviral research, their targets are well characterized and its inhibition by drugs has been broadly studied. Protease inhibitors play a main role in HIV-1 therapy. Furthermore, these compounds have shown inhibitory effects over proteases from pathogens such as Leishmania and malaria (Valdivieso et al., 2010; Sonoiki et al., 2016; de Wilde et al., 2014) . Thus, the use of protease inhibitors in other viral species could be supported by these non-specific protease inhibitions. Previous reports showed the inhibition of SARS-CoV protease by protease inhibitors used in HIV-1 therapy, being an interesting pharmacological target to treat SARS-CoV-2. Previously, scientific reports showed that some HIV-1 protease inhibitors could decrease SARS-CoV replication (Savarino, 2005) . Nevertheless, not all of the protease inhibitors showed the same efficacy against this virus (Jenwitheesuk and Samudrala, 2003) . Based on that, in this work, we established an in silico approach to validate the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 protease by HIV-1 protease inhibitor. The results showed that the main protease inhibitors used in HIV-1 therapy could produce a decrease in the protease activity in coronavirus enzyme. The compound with the highest binding affinity was saquinavir. Preliminary reports are showing that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with lopinavir could achieve viral clearance (Lim et al., 2020) .",

Thus, based on their safety profiles, SQV and LPV could be used as therapy and/or pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce new infections by SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the data obtained from prior outbreaks, the clinical results obtained by using protease inhibitors in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results shown here, support the use of protease inhibitors to treat SARS-CoV-2. In addition, to contribute to further development of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, in this work experimental compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 protease were evaluated by virtual screening. Some compounds showed comparable binding energy values to the SARS-CoV-2 protease than to those observed for SQV, LPV and RTV. ADME (for Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) parameters estimation for new drugs, significantly helps to reduce the pharmacokinetics-related failure in clinical phases. These results evidence that these compounds could be suitable for further medicinal chemistry optimization to produce the second generation of inhibitors more specific and potent against SARS-CoV-2.",

Therefore, proposing a combinatory therapy against SARS-CoV-2 could be a feasible approach. The starting therapeutic scheme could include remdesivir, with the disadvantage of its intravenous administration, and HIV-1 protease inhibitors such as Lopinavir or Saquinavir.
