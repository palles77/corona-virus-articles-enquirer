            "text": "Since started in the last month of 2019, the outbreak of the SARS-Cov-2 infection has successfully attracted attention of the whole world. By virtue of its highly contagious attribution, this novel coronavirus has spread across over 113 countries/territories and caused 118,319 infected cases with 4292 deaths, as of 11 th March 2020 and the numbers are still rapidly increasing. 1 Moreover, the threat of SARS-Cov-2 to global health is rapidly increasing, which made the World Health Organization declare COVID-19 a 'Pandemic'. Undoubtedly, preparedness for the virus strike is necessary and critically important, especially for those countries at high risk but with relatively weaker public health systems. Under this circumstance, the experience of containment from peer countries and territories and comprehensive research on COVID-19 would undoubtedly help. Many previous studies have generally reported the epidemiological features, clinical characteristics and virology of SARS-Cov-2. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] But the features and characteristic of the disease may present differently among different locations and over time 9 , since the pathogen, SARS-Cov-2, may evolve after transmissions. 10 It thus is important to closely follow these changes for better containment and management of COVID-19. In addition, the durations of COVID-19 (e.g., the average time from exposure to recovery and hospitalization duration) which is important for understanding this disease and useful for the preparedness and response correctly to COVID-19, were not reported, mainly because most patients included in the previous studies still remained in hospital as the study being done. Here, we presented the clinical data of 77 hospitalized patients with COVID-2019 in YouAn Hospital (Beijing, China) with the aim of giving the information about clinical characteristics and different durations of COVID-19: incubation period, illness onset to first hospital, illness onset to discharge, exposure to discharge, and hospitalization duration. Additionally, this paper also aims to identify the potential risk factors for longer hospitalization duration of COVID-19.",

Among a small number of patients, there was a wide span of age from 1 to 94 years, suggesting that individuals of all ages are susceptible to SARS-Cov-2 infection. Intriguingly, more females (55.8%) were identified in our study, as contract to previously studies where males were reported to constitute a higher proportion of patients [2] [3] [4] 6 revealing that males had higher expression level of ACE2 receptor and thus were more susceptible to SARS-Cov-2 invasion. 14 Recently, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention presented the biggest data of COVID-19 (44,672 confirmed cases) and indicated a relatively even sex distribution (males 51.4% vs. females 48.6%). 15 These findings suggest that the sex difference found at the early stage of the outbreak might be of coincidence such as the exposure difference between sexes. In our study, most of the patients had a history of exposure to Wuhan, especially at the initial stage of the spreading in Beijing, and the number of those patients was reducing over time as along with reducing of the number of all patients. This suggested the effectiveness of quarantine of Wuhan city on the control and containment of COVID-19 in Beijing and other cities and countries as demonstrated by a more recent study. 16 Lots of patients (42.9%) got infected by family clustering, which emphasizes the importance of the self-.

It is equivocal that whether longer duration between symptom onset to hospital admission is associated with clinical outcome of patients. Huang et al. 2 did not find a difference of this duration between ICU and non-ICU patients, however, Wang et al. 5 investigated more patients and revealed that patients admitted to ICU had longer duration (8 vs. 6 days, P=0.009). In the present study, we also observed a longer duration in severe patients versus non-severe patients (supplementary files).

However, in their study, the patients' incubation period is two days longer than that of our study. Nevertheless, length of hospital stay of COVID-19 is significantly shorter than that of SARS in 2003, which was almost one month 17 , further indicating the milder severity of COVID-19. We also revealed that the cumulative probability of COVID-19 patients discharged within two weeks were 59.7% for non-severe and 11.8% for severe patients, respectively, which means that nearly 60% of non-severe patients will be discharged within two weeks. Since length of hospital stay is related to duration of illness onset to hospital admission, duration of illness onset to discharge may be better to present the clinical course of COVID-19. If further taking incubation time into consideration, the whole duration of COVID-19, from exposure to recovery, is 23 days. To the best of our knowledge, this might be the first description of whole duration of COVID-19. But only a small number of patients from a single center were included (n=20), further studies based on large sample size from multiple centers are warranted to confirm this finding.",

Obviously, length of hospital stay differs across hospitals, cities and countries. It would be more valuable to draw the corresponding durations and to identify the risk factors based on the dataset at city or nation scale. Second, we could not provide useful information on the average duration from the illness onset to death, because of limited data in our study. Third, treatment is a pivotal determinant of durations of disease, however, we currently have no detailed data of treatment for patients with COVID-19 and cannot determine the influence of treatment on durations of COVID-19. But we will continue this work in the future.",
