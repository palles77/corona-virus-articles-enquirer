Expansion of human populations has caused both a greater proximity to wildlife habitats, resulting in the emergence of new zoonoses, and a massive urbanisation process, which facilitates the rapid spread of communicable diseases in human beings. Travel across the world has become increasingly frequent, resulting in the ever-increasing risk of worldwide contagion spread. These emerging problems were highlighted during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. 1 Imported highly infectious diseases (HID), such as Lassa fever and viral haemorrhagic fever, have been reported many times in the literature but have seldom been at the origin of an outbreak. 2,3 Terrorist attacks with biological agents pose a substantial threat to the safety, health, and security of the citizens of every country.",

Eff ective treatment and preventive measures are not usually available.\" Several laboratoryassociated infections with group 3 and 4 pathogenic agents have already been reported. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Although laboratories that handle group 3 and 4 agents should comply with biosafety regulations, laboratory leakage can happen at any time, for example, when working with a known agent or when attempting to isolate an unknown infectious agent, such as occurred with mimivirus. 21 Experience shows that the recognition and isolation of a new infectious agent is often followed by a reported laboratory-acquired infection caused by the new isolate, as was reported for SARS. 22, 23 The infection of a single laboratory worker with a highly infectious agent could be the origin of an outbreak, particularly if the agent has the capability of human-to-human transmission (ie, SARS-associated coronavirus). 23 In some situations, such as a cough in so-called \"superspreader\" patients with extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis, smallpox, or SARS-associated coronavirus, or exposure to infected blood of a patient with late-phase haemorrhagic fever, the inoculums to which health-care workers are exposed are likely to be equivalent to those received by a laboratory worker during specimen handling. The care of such patients should consequently be administered in a way to ensure the same level of protection and safety to health-care workers as to laboratory workers exposed to the same agent.",

This network of clinicians, public health epidemiologists, microbiologists, infectioncontrol and critical-care clinicians, who are experienced in the management of HID, represent national or regional infectious diseases units designated to care for patients with HID. One of EUNID's agreed tasks was to develop a consensus statement on the design and operation of high-level isolation units (HLIU) in Europe. 25 An HID is transmissible from person to person, causes life-threatening illness, presents a serious hazard in health-care settings and the community, and therefore requires specifi c control measures. 25 An HLIU is defi ned as a health-care facility that is specifi cally designed to provide safe, secure, high-quality and appropriate care, with optimum infection containment, infection prevention, and control procedures for a single patient or a small number of patients who have, or who may have, an HID.

As a consequence, the emergency department of any hospital should be prepared for such events, and both training and structural features should be implemented. 28 Based on studies of SARS transmission, measures designed to control respiratory droplets and secretions, along with hand hygiene, would seem to off er signifi cant protection to other patients and health-care workers who have close contact with source patients. 51, 52 Given the challenge of recognising early HID cases, and considering the potential for the spread of respiratory infections in health-care settings, the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended a broader strategy to prevent health-care-associated transmission of respiratory illnesses in response to SARS. 53 In addition to standard precautions, the CDC suggest that an effi cient measure to reduce the risk of infection transmission needs to be systematically implemented by health-care workers. The CDC described the new standard approach to manage patients with febrile respiratory illness as \"respiratory hygiene\" or \"cough etiquette\". 54 Patients with cough and fever should be encouraged to report symptoms at admission and should be encouraged or asked to wear a surgical mask and wash their hands after contact with respiratory secretions. These patients should be separated from other patients in the waiting area, and should be examined and assessed as soon as possible by the emergency staff in a single room. 54 Signs should be displayed in the waiting areas to promote these measures and to educate patients and health-care workers, and emergency staff should comply with droplet precautions.",

To reduce the risk of transmission to health-care workers, samples from patients should be taken in the EDIR or HLIU, depending on availability. Severely ill patients may necessitate frequent blood sampling and intravenous line placement for reliable antimicrobial or antiviral drug administration. To reduce exposure due to accidental needle-stick incidents, we recommend the use of a routinely secured arterial line and central venous line access by an HID-trained physician, thus allowing safe serial blood sampling and drug administration without further needle-based procedures.",

            "text": "The risk of being infected with SARS-associated coronavirus was reported to be about 13-times higher among physicians and nurses who performed or assisted in endotracheal intubations in intensive care units (ICUs) than in those who did not. 65 Nurses who became ill were often exposed to SARS-associated coronavirus within 48 h of a patient's admission, during which time the patient usually deteriorated with symptoms, increasing the spread of droplets or aerosols (eg, dyspnoea, cough, etc). 66, 67 Patients admitted to the ICU are usually severely ill, and are likely to have a high viral load and to be at a point of maximum infectiousness. 68 Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is a mode of ventilation assistance used in early acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome. NPPV reduces the intubation rate and is eff ective in the treatment of SARS-related acute respiratory failure without posing infection risks to health-care workers. [69] [70] [71] [72] In this setting, intubation has been avoided in up to two-thirds of cases in some studies. 73, 74 If aerosolisation and airborne transmission are discounted, respiratory secretions or fl uids, or both, are the main route of SARS transmission, ultimately leading to an overwhelming risk of infection via intubation. However, this mode of transmission does not occur with other airborne pathogens, most notably avian infl uenza, which can aerosolise or disperse up to 0\u00b75 m around a patient undergoing NPPV. 75 The main problem with dispersion through NPPV is not the exhalation portion of the respiratory circuit but the inevitable mask Review leaks. Consequently, intubation or mechanical ventilation should be preferred to NPPV if safely achievable to control droplet aerosolisation and dispersion. Consequently, endotracheal intubation should be done by the most skilled person available. In addition, that person should wear personal protective equipment, including eye protection, and use rapid sequence induction. 43 ICU rooms should be subjected to negative pressure and a minimum of 15 air changes per hour. 76, 77 Some researchers advocate the use of a powered air-purifying respirator, particularly during high-risk manipulations such as endotracheal intubation, because it off ers supplementary protection with a better fi t to the healthcare worker's face. 78, 79 However, its use is a matter of debate because the risk of dysfunction seems important, which may increase the risk of exposure. Problems in cleaning, disinfection, and storage of the respirator may also increase the risk of exposure.",

SARS transmission has been reported or suggested after the intubation of patients, 84 and use of a nebuliser by health-care workers in patients with SARS resulted in a major outbreak of the disease. 85 In a retrospective study among critical-care nurses in Toronto, 86 the probability of a SARS infection was 6% in nurses who assisted during intubation, suctioning, and manipulating the oxygen mask. In the same study, wearing a mask, especially an N95 mask, was deemed protective. 86 A high-fl ow-rate oxygen mask may also result in health-care worker infection, 83 and we have thus suggested that NPPV is preferred to facial mask aerosol therapy if available. Bronchoscopy has also been suggested to increase SARS-associated coronavirus transmission in health-care workers. 71 The aerosolisation of lung pathogens during fl exible endoscopy and hospital-acquired infections during these procedures are both well documented and have led to standard guidelines for fl exible endoscopy. 87 Similar transmissions would probably occur with other respiratory agents, such as avian infl uenza and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Bronchoscopy, airway suctioning, and other procedure that may induce coughing and expose health-care workers to potentially infected aerosolised respiratory droplets pose an increased risk of transmission of those agents. In most hospitals, rooms dedicated for bronchoscopy are under negative pressure, but these rooms are not necessarily air fi ltered. 88 ",

Aerosol production during autopsy, particularly from ruptured organs, had been recognised early in this situation and has led to some precautions. 107 During the fi rst reported episode of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the fi rst fi ve suspected patients were autopsied with standard precautions only, even though the agent was isolated and classifi ed as a group 3 agent. 108 Fortunately, no transmission to autopsy personnel occurred. During the SARS episode, many autopsies were done, and although there was no case of transmission, several investigators have raised concerns over biosafety in autopsy rooms. 105, 108, 109 Recent guidelines have been published to prevent infection during autopsy. 110 Before an autopsy is done on a patient suspected to have died from an HID, the possible risks and benefi ts must be carefully considered. 58 Limited autopsy or post-mortem collection of blood and percutaneous liver biopsy material may be appropriate. Several pathologists suggest that safety measures applied to laboratory workers should also be applied during and after autopsy. Furthermore, patients who have died from an unknown HID or from a known group 3 or 4 agent should be autopsied only if necessary and in a biosafety level 3 or 4 isolation room. 58, 108, 109 ",
