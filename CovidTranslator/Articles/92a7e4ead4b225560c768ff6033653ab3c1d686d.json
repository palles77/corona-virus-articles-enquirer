            "text": "A phase I clinical trial was approved in May 2007 by the US Food and Drug Administration to evaluate RNA interference (RNAi) as a nucleic acid therapy for HIV-1 infections [1] . This trial is the first to employ a lentivirus vector for transduction into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that later differentiate into different immune cells. This vector design is the first tested that targets, genetically, a combination of three sites in HIV replication. It is also the first employing RNAi in its therapeutic design using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against the Tat/Rev site of the HIV genome. The other two nucleic acid constructions placed into this vector include a ribozyme designed to decrease host cell CCR5 expression by degrading mRNA for CCR5 and an oligonucleotide decoy that binds and sequesters the TAR protein synthesized in HIV-infected cells [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Gene therapy, previously focused on correction of DNA defects, stopped after deaths occurred in two different human trials [7] . Strategies for gene therapy have since been directed at inhibiting the effects of aberrant or noncellular genes. HIV trials employed mechanisms associated with expression of ribozymes or antisense RNA [8, 9] . Neither approach has been as successful as anticipated for any targeted therapy [7] . The recognition during the 1990s of RNAi as a natural, biological means of silencing specific genes led to its widespread use as a laboratory tool to examine gene function. The antiviral potential of RNAi was quickly realized and tested.",

Subsequent reports suggest adequate feasibility to plan phase I clinical trials [12] .

The interference mechanism employs dsRNA in siRNA form or microRNA (miRNA) and is usually around 19 to 25 basepairs (bp), but no more than 30 bp, in length. The size limitation imposed on the small RNA species helps to avoid initiation of immune responses, especially interferon (IFN), which arise in response to the presence of dsRNA longer than 30 bp in length [11\u2022,16\u2022] contributing to the pathogenic processes of some viruses. During RNAi, short RNA associates with a complex of host-cell enzymes. These include the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and argonaute 2 (AGO2), which initiate degradation of target RNA synthesized in the cell. siRNA are dsRNA perfectly matched in sequence; miRNA are imperfectly matched dsRNA.",

Synthetic siRNA may also include hairpin structures (shRNA) that may function like siRNA after cleavage by Dicer. Alternatively, siRNA already at working length are introduced into the cell and bypass cleavage to act against intracellular copies of mRNA from infectious agents such as viruses. The aggregate of proteins and enzymes comprising RISC attaches to either siRNA or miRNA. It is thought that one of the enzymatic functions contained in RISC cleaves one of the strands of siRNA or miRNA, usually the sense strand, activating RISC in the process. The activated complex then finds and binds to a target messenger RNA (mRNA), containing a complementary nucleotide sequence that matches the strand remaining in RISC. The binding interferes with the expression of target mRNA. If the binding is perfect, as would be seen for siRNA, then target mRNA is cleaved by one of the enzymes in RISC and releases activated RISC to be used again. If the binding is not exact, similar to what is seen for miRNA, the activated complex disrupts mRNA expression by blocking translation.",

Several characteristics of the RNAi pathway are particularly attractive for development as a therapy against infectious agents such as viruses. The mechanism provides a way to act on targets specific to each viral replication cycle [11\u2022 ] that cannot be reached easily with current medicinal therapeutics [14\u2022,15,16\u2022] . This approach, involving natural host cell components, would potentially reduce the toxicity to host cells that can occur during treatment with conventional drugs. Because RNAi treatment would be designed from knowledge of the targeted viral sequence, it is possible to generate and test prospective siRNA quickly. The interference would not require targeting of just the functional areas of a viral protein but would allow targeting to be anywhere on viral mRNA. Design strategies could proceed as soon as sequence data of the target genome were obtained, even if the activity encoded by the target region of the genome was not known [11\u2022,14\u2022] . This feature clearly allows increased flexibility in design and number of targets available for RNAi agents. The release of activated RISC allows it to be recycled for repeated use due to the stability and efficacy of the enzymes in RISC [17] . The presence of siRNA introduced exogenously is short lived [17] , again reducing the possible toxicity of the treatment.",

In one study [24] , siRNA in a cationic polymer was injected retro-orbitally into mice. Alterna-tively, shRNA targeting the influenza proteins was placed into a lentivirus vector and transfected intratracheally or retro-orbitally. In another study [25] , siRNA diluted in phosphate buffered saline was administered intravenously in the tail vein, followed by challenge with an influenza/ siRNA mixture intranasally. Both strategies appeared to work prophylactically and after infection, increasing survival, reducing lung viral titers and decreasing weight loss during infection.",

Use of RNAi to suppress chronic infection requires that siRNA or shRNA reach [28, 29] and have potential for prolonged expression in appropriate target cells [30] .

Individuals may not know they have acute HIV infection. Therefore, RNAi therapy would likely focus on chronic infection. During acute infection, the virus travels to many reservoirs and cell types throughout the body to establish persistent and latent infection that may not be detected for several years. Delivery of RNAi therapeutic agents would need to reach these sites. Also, the make-up of quasispecies carried by the infected individual constantly changes, arising from small sequence variation that could affect the efficacy and design of nucleic acidbased therapy. The virus replicates very quickly and easily selects escape or resistant mutants in response to antiretroviral therapy. A complication is that many subtypes of HIV-1 found globally have distinct sequence variation, and the virus recombines easily among subtypes to form circulating recombinant forms. Finally, there is no animal model that completely encompasses all these features, making in vivo evaluation of new therapeutic agents, such as RNAi, difficult.",

Although the data showed this approach to be promising when siRNA was transfected 24 hours prior to HIV infection, the authors suggested that CCR5 might be a better target. Subsequent studies successfully targeted CCR5 expression, as the protein seems to be dispensable in humans [2, 3, 42] and HIV tends to infect cells with this receptor more during early HIV infection. Downregulation of the host CCR5 gene was shown in cell lines carrying siRNA, shRNA, or ribozyme delivered by a lentivirus vector leading to a reduction of HIV viral load. One study incorporated a second shRNA against the CXCR4 gene into the same vector and showed this biphasic shRNAvector could also work successfully in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [43] . Of interest is a report of the ability of the Tat protein made in HIV-infected cells to be able to circumvent RNAi by suppressing Dicer activity [44] . It was suggested that shRNA might not be as effective in HIV-infected cells because it would need to be processed by Dicer but that short precut siRNA delivered to the cell would bypass the block. The vector and constructs used in the phase I HIV RNAi trial [1] [2] [3] are a lentivirus capable of infecting cells that are not actively dividing. The siRNA target is the Tat/Rev region of the HIV genome [2] . The sequence of this construct should allow it to be active in binding spliced and unspliced mRNA found in the infected cell so that it may silence HIV genes during two different replication stages.",

The silencing activity of the subtype C shRNA to gag varied depending on the clinical isolate [45] . The activity of shRNA against subtype B Vif was the most successful, able to inhibit infection with subtype B strains from China and the United States as well as a recombinant B/C strain [46\u2022 ]. Sequence analysis indicated that target mRNA had to be highly conserved within the binding region of the shRNA but could tolerate some variation at the 5' or 3' ends, emphasizing the importance of this information when designing siRNA or shRNA.",

Studies indicated that the replicating virus developed the mutations and not the shRNA [18] . Resistance developed after a few weeks in vitro [18, 19] . The types of mutations varied. Most mutations were point mutations [18] [19] [20] 47] . Other escape mechanisms included a deletion of 106 bp that removed the binding site targeted by siRNA and the acquisition of mutations sequentially [19] . Also observed was development of mutations outside of the siRNA binding site so that the target virus developed a different folding secondary structure causing the target site to be inaccessible to siRNA [20] . In a very thorough study, each site in a 17-bp target was altered systematically to evaluate binding by siRNA [47] . The data, similar to those reported for subtype binding [46\u2022] , indicated that the vulnerable bases causing loss of siRNA binding efficacy were in the center of the target sequence or were flanking the center region. More tolerance was shown at the extreme ends.",

Currently, RNAi design seems to be less complicated for viruses causing only acute infections.

They suggest that primary tissue sites that are accessible and are of mucosal origin can be treated with siRNA efficaciously to suppress acute infection when delivered in simple transfection or physiologic medium. RNAi may be an effective microbicide. A phase II trial testing RNAi of RSV infection, announced in June 2007 [16\u2022] , reinforces the potential of siRNA as an inhaled therapeutic agent. The influenza, SARS-CoV, and flavivirus models demonstrated possible benefits of using RNAi therapy following viral exposure if delivery of the agents can be optimized. They show that design of the RNAi sequence to target regions with highly conserved sequence might also increase potential for use against related viruses [23\u2022,27,36] with wider geographic distribution.",

The use of combination therapy in RNAi [2] , as for current antiretroviral strategy, may be a viable strategy to circumvent this problem. Long-term expression of agents of RNAi in multiple reservoirs and cells is still a challenge. The attraction of RNAi against HIV therapeutically is that it is a natural biological mechanism that may have much less associated toxicity in the face of life-long treatment. Also, it may be less expensive than current therapy [1] . It will be of great interest to see how the clinical trials using RNAi fare.",
