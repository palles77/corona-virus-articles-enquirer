We analyze the rate \u03b1 in 25 different countries, choosing as a starting point in each country the first day with 30 cases and fitting for the following 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth in a rather homogeneous way. We look for a link between the rate \u03b1 and the average temperature T of each country, in the month of the epidemic growth. Fitting with a linear behavior \u03b1(T ), we find evidence for a decreasing growth rate as a function of T . However, a decrease in the growth rate is visible also in the very low-T data. Going beyond a linear model, a peak at about (9.5 \u00b1 2.6) \u2022 C seems to be present in the data. Our findings give hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown policies. In general the propagation should be hopefully stopped by strong lockdown, testing and tracking policies, before the arrival of the next cold season.",

An important piece of information is whether the growth rate of the confirmed cases among the population could decrease with increasing temperature. Experimental research on related viruses found indeed a decrease at high temperature and humidity [1] . We try to address this question using available epidemiological data. A similar analysis for the data from January 20 to February 4, 2020, among 403 different Chinese cities, was performed in [2] and similar studies were recently performed in [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .
