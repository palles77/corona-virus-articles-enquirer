While SARS was sweeping over almost 30 countries, most hospitals in Taiwan instituted mandatory quarantine measures, one of the most effective public health strategies for preventing disease transmission. We explored the anti-SARS quarantine experience of patients in a hospital-based fever screening station. Methods: We conducted a phenomenologic, qualitative study using semistructured telephone interviews during the SARS outbreak in Taiwan. Seventeen patients with fever who were quarantined in the fever screening station of a hospital emergency department for at least 2 hours were recruited into this study. Results: Data analysis using Collaizi's 9 steps revealed 2 categories-external burden and internal struggle-and 6 themes regarding patients' quarantine experience. External burden included 3 themes: (1) bearing the uncomfortable surroundings, (2) facing discrimination, and (3) lacking in-person family support. Internal struggle consisted of 3 themes: (1) struggle with being quarantined, (2) struggle with emotional turmoil, and (3) struggle with possible SARS diagnosis. Conclusion: These results will contribute to sensitizing health care professionals to empathize with quarantined persons while providing quality quarantine care and other infection control measures.",

Until the outbreak struck Hong Kong's and Taiwan's hospitals, it had not yet been identified as a dangerous disease.

            "text": "According to existing evidence, persons with related symptoms who have cared for, lived with, or had direct contact with the respiratory secretions or body fluids of a suspected or probable case of SARS would be contagious and could transmit the disease by close contact. 1, 2 However, the public became panicky because the media repeatedly reported the increasing probable cases. To control the epidemic, all countries infected with SARS implemented several public health measures, including heightened infection control measures in hospitals and aggressive quarantine measures. 1, 4, 6, 9 Quarantine has been defined as the confinement and separation of subjects suspected to transmit a contagious disease. 10 It differs from the term ''isolation, '' which means the isolation of subjects already known to be infected with a contagious disease to prevent them from transmitting disease to other people. Quarantine was no longer used after the mid-20th century because of the discovery and development of antibiotics and vaccinations, but bioterrorism and devastating diseases such as SARS have revived this antiquated practice, even for entire cities. 10 Beginning on March 18, it was dictated in Taiwan that all persons who had been in close contact with a SARS patient should be quarantined for 10 to 14 days in accordance with the incubation period for SARS. 11 In addition, once a person with fever visited a clinic or outpatient department, he or she was referred to a SARS preliminary diagnostic hospital with an outside fever/cough-screening station in a quarantine area inside tents or steel-built houses. 3 Physicians made detailed diagnostic examinations and related treatments and decided whether to discharge, hospitalize, or refer the individual to negative-pressure isolation wards. 3 Although only a small percentage of persons quarantined had suspected or probable SARS diagnosed subsequently, and a smaller percentage had a laboratoryconfirmed case of SARS, the use of quarantine might have prevented an infected individual from exposing others and generating successive waves of infection. 11 The research on quarantining has mainly focused on 2 aspects: anti-SARS strategies and the responses of the quarantined. Studies related to anti-SARS strategies addressed decision making, cost-effectiveness, and the management and ethics of quarantine strategies. [11] [12] [13] Other studies investigated the responses of the quarantined, such as compliance, risk perceptions, and psychologic effects. [14] [15] [16] Moreover, most of these studies focused on home quarantine based on data collected in the post-SARS period rather than hospitalbased quarantine. In contrast, few studies explored the hospital-based quarantine experience from patients' point of view during the SARS outbreak. Therefore, we undertook this qualitative study to explore patients' quarantine experience in a fever screening station of an emergency department (ED) during the SARS outbreak. 17 The aim of our inquiry was to develop a better understanding of how to provide humanistic quarantine care and education in relation to infection control and quarantine measures in a health care delivery system.",

Although most participants knew that the quarantine was the national SARS prevention policy, half of them still experienced conflict in accepting their own quarantine. Most of them expressed feeling unprepared for quarantine, half disagreed with the quarantine justification, and 2 were unfamiliar with the quarantine policy. Four participants disagreed with the quarantine, apparently because medical professionals provided insufficient information. One of them admitted, ''I feared so much that I was isolated with SARS patients. Moreover, I doubted whether the beds or chairs at the quarantine room were completely decontaminated.'' However, the rest of the participants agreed and accepted the quarantine because of altruism and recognition of the quarantine strengths. As one of them said, ''The quarantine policy is very important for SARS prevention. It could screen for high-risk populations and provide us an outside isolated room for examinations and observations, thus decreasing the SARS epidemic in the hospital. So I was willing to accept that.'' Struggle with emotional turmoil. During the quarantine period, participants experienced several intertwined emotions: anger, anxiety, fear, loneliness, guilt, uncertainty, worry, threatened feeling, and loss of control. These emotions might have resulted from disagreement with the quarantine, insufficient knowledge about the quarantine and SARS, the possibility of being diagnosed SARS or infected by others, disruption of their duties/roles and normal life, no in-person contact with significant others, limited space and movement, dissatisfaction with medical care, uncomfortable physical symptoms, and in-hospitable quarantine environment. A 40-year-old man who worked in a factory said: ''I had to work during that time. But nobody told me when I could go home until 10 hours later. I was very angry about waiting.'' Another young girl said, ''Nobody except the nurse would come near you. I felt so lonely and scared.'' Furthermore, a majority of participants experienced uncertainty. For example, one participant said, ''They took me to that quarantine room, only asked me to lie down on the bed, and not to go outside except to the toilet by following the yellow line on the floor. You never knew about the next step and how long you would wait.'' Struggle with possible SARS diagnosis. Each participant mentioned feeling very afraid of being diagnosed with SARS during the quarantine period and were burdened by this shadow. Finally, all of them were completely relieved when SARS was ruled out. At the same time, they were informed of the quarantine ending. Many participants used ''big stone'' to describe their laden worry about being diagnosed with SARS. As one participant said, ''The \u00d4big stone\u00d5 was finally thrown down the moment that doctor told me, \u00d4You have been excluded from a diagnosis of SARS.\u00d5 ''",

            "text": "Under the SARS threat, quarantine was a public health tool to prevent infectious diseases. Persons with fever were quarantined in an outside fever screening station of SARS preliminary diagnostic hospitals. The epidemic revived our examination of this defunct practice. For those involved in controlling hospital infections, SARS represents one of many new challenges: to examine infection control strategies, alert mechanisms, response capability, and to repair any identified inadequacies. Facing those challenges will help us to conquer future epidemics. 9, 16, 21, 22 Our analysis of participants' interviews showed that quarantine experience in a hospital-based fever screening station had 2 aspects. Externally, they were burdened by uncomfortable surroundings, others' discrimination, and lack of in-person family support. Internally, they struggled with accepting the quarantine, emotional turmoil, and possible SARS diagnosis. Our findings were similar to the psychologic impact of quarantine on 19 Canadians: fearfulness, loneliness, anxiety, insomnia, boredom, anger, uncertainty, and stigmatization. 21 To experience quarantine was not easy for patients who were battling heavy emotional turmoil under the strict infection control policy. Like other quarantined persons in relevant studies, [14] [15] [16] 21 some participants perceived risk, felt doubt, and were reluctant to accept being quarantined owing to insufficient or inadequate information about SARS and quarantine policy. In order to effectively implement infection control policy, it is imperitive to increase the quaranined person's and the public's understanding of the quarantine measure in controlling infectious disease. In addition, some quarantined participants in this study did not seem to meet the quarantine criteria. 12, 13 Wang et al's study 22 suggested that targeting quarantine efforts to persons with known or suspected exposure to SARS cases would improve the efficiency of SARS quarantine.",

As pandemics continue to threaten the world, as in the recent emergence of the H1N1 virus, this study provides some implications for the practice of infection control. Adequate planning should be undertaken for the arrangement of physical settings and equipment for emergencies requiring quarantine measures, eg, equipment for temperature control (like electronic fans and blankets), portable toilet, telecommunication, privacy, and mosquito prevention. Temporal and sterilized cell phones will assist the quarantined to communicate with and get information and emotional support from health care workers and family members without increasing contamination risks. Furthermore, it is important to meet the basic physical needs of the quarantined, such as meals, water, and symptoms management, and to treat SARS-related symptoms as well as non-SARS-related symptoms.",
