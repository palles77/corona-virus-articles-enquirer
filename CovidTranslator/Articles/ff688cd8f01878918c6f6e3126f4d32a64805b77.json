Instead, traditionally, virus concentration is deduced as a function of the ability of the virus to infect and to form plaques on its host cell per unit volume. Therefore, the working concentration of a given virus stock can roughly be defined in terms of its infectivity, as the number of plaque-forming units (PFUs) mL \u00c01 (Sambrook and Russell, 2001) . This indirect measure of concentration assumes that every virus in the solution is equally infectious with equal access to the viral host of interest. However, in the case of the bacterial virus MS2, as well as many other viruses, it has been shown that virus infectivity varies and that, in some cases, as little as only 30% of the virus population in solution is infectious. Therefore, PFUs may often be an underestimate of virus concentration (Davis and Sinsheimer, 1963) .",

Additionally, scattering methods such as classical light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) have also been employed to measure the concentration of samples when the molecular weight of the virus is known (Guinier, 1939; Guinier and Fournet, 1955; Jacrot and Zaccai, 1981; Koch et al., 2003) . Most virus samples (be they naturally occurring or recombinant) are typically not sufficiently pure and/or available in large enough quantities for accurate concentration determination using these methods. When an accurate measure of virus concentration (or particle number) is required, a specialized method of EM, quantitative EM, has also been successfully employed, but is technically challenging for routine use (Zheng et al., 1996) .",

In general, IVDS is a single instrument that consists of two modules and a computer system. The first module contains a detachable ultrafiltration unit which can be used for sample purification and/or concentrating the virus into smaller volumes. This aspect of the technology was not analyzed in these studies (Wick, 2002a; McCubbin, 1999c: Wick, 1999, p. 49) . The detachable ultrafiltration module is connected to the central IVDS module, which contains a gas-phase electrophoretic mobility analyzer (GEMMA), differential mobility analyzer (DMA) and a condensation particle counter. The GEMMA aerolizes the liquid virus sample and then the DMA separates the virus particles by size for subsequent presentation to the condensation particle counter which ultimately sizes and counts the virus particles. Finally, the data are collected and analyzed by a separate computer system. The GEMMA, DMA and condensation particle counter in combination with the IVDS computer system is collectively referred to herein as the IVDS. Although similar technology such as charged reduced electrospray size spectrometry (CRESS) (Bacher et al., 2001; Hogan et al., 2006 Hogan et al., , 2005 Kaufman et al., 1998) has been described in the literature, only this instrument was specifically designed, patented and available for commercial use for the analysis of viruses (Wick, 2002a, b; Wick and Anderson, 2000) . In principal, the IVDS instrument has been shown to size and to determine the concentration of virus particles in the 10-100 nm size range (Wick, 2002a, b; Wick and McCubbin, 1999a) .

Namely, virus size and concentration can be determined simultaneously without prior knowledge of any other physical sample features, or the need for the addition of sizing standards to the sample. Furthermore, virus-containing samples need not be homogenous. Samples containing a variety of different viruses can be assayed in solution and their size and concentration determined individually under physiological conditions. Also, sample analysis is rapid. Typical measurements take about 5 min (Wick, 2002a, b; Wick and Anderson, 2000; Wick and McCubbin, 1999a) . Since the accuracy of the IVDS technology has not been reported, IVDS presents an ideal test system to determine if SAS techniques are suitable for quantitative quality assurance measurements necessary for the validation of novel virus characterization technology.",

First, IVDS virus sizing ability was measured using synthetic (commercially available latex microspheres) and biological (bacterial virus MS2) size standards. Specifically, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-traceable synthetic size standard microspheres were chosen as size standard controls (or standard reference material (SRM)) because they are generally accepted as the state of the art in the area of size standard particles and they are commercially available. The bacterial virus MS2 was used as a biomarker and size standard to control for the possibility that the IVDS instrument might analyze synthetic microspheres differently compared to naturally occurring biological material. In addition, MS2 is a model internal control particle because its size, molecular weight and molecular coefficient have been reported in detail by a variety of groups using numerous methods (Kuzmanovic et al., 2003; Overby et al., 1966; Strauss and Sinsheimer, 1963) .",

IVDS is a multi-component system consisting of (a) a detachable ultrafiltration unit; (b) the central instrument unit which houses a GEMMA detector and a DMA, which is connected to a condensation particle counter; and (c) the computer system. The ultrafiltration unit which concentrates and purifies virus samples in solution has been previously described (Wick, 2002a, b; Wick and Anderson, 2000; McCubbin, 1999a-c: Wick, 1999, p. 49) and was not utilized in these studies. Instead this study focused on the quantitative abilities of the GEMMA detection unit and the DMA, which have been specifically configured for the analysis of viruses (Wick, 2002a, b; Wick and Anderson, 2000) . The IVDS GEMMA detector consists of an electrospray that aerosolizes the sample for subsequent passage through charged air to dry the particles. In the process, most of the charges from the particles are removed, leaving them either charge neutral or singly ionized. Singly ionized particles are then introduced into the detector, a DMA, to separate the sample by size. The individual particles (transmitted by the DMA) are counted by the condensation particle counter (Wick, 2002a, b) . The instrument is controlled and the data are recorded and displayed by the computer system. Only the IVDS beta unit was tested herein. Models containing upgrades or modifications were not specifically evaluated. These results are only valid for the calibrated IVDS beta instrument at the time of the study using the calibration curves described herein. The specific IVDS instrument examined in this study was beta model instrument, number GEMMA-WP, serial number 103 (TSI Incorporated, Shoreview, MN).",

Notice that the 40 nm standard curve is linear over all data points from 2.4 \u00c2 10 10 to 2.5 \u00c2 10 13 cm \u00c03 . In most cases the error bars are too small to be easily seen except in the case of the most concentrated sample. This large error is not due to instrument resolution but to the small number of sample particles counted, two instead of the usual four. The linear equation which best describes all of the data including the standard error is Y \u00bc 9.5 \u00c2 10 \u00c011 X+B, where Y is the raw IVDS count, X the concentration (particles cm \u00c03 ) and B any constant between \u00c024 and +65.

The MS2 virus stock sample was then measured by SAXS and SANS and its molecular weight determined using the concentrations given by both concentration determination methods. Table 4 shows the concentration determination used for the SAXS and SANS analysis, respectively. Table 5 shows the MS2 virus molecular weight determination based on the concentrations given by IVDS and OD, as well as previously reported molecular weight determinations by other groups. The molecular weight of MS2 is generally accepted to be 3.6 \u00c2 10 6 g mol \u00c01 (Da) on the basis of classical light scattering methods using OD as a concentration Moller (1964) determination method. The molecular weight determinations described herein and (Kuzmanovic et al., 2003) using SANS, and either the OD or the IVDS concentration determination methods, show good agreement. Specifically, the molecular weight of MS2 using SANS and IVDS concentration determinations is (3.570.5) \u00c2 10 6 Da and using SANS and OD concentration determinations is (3.770.2) \u00c2 10 6 Da (Kuzmanovic et al., 2003) . These results are confirmed by the weighted SAXS analysis of MS2 molecular weight using OD and IVDS concentration determination (Kuzmanovic et al., 2006) .",

Specifically, it was determined using SAXS and SANS that the virus sizing and concentration technology, IVDS, can accurately measure the size of synthetic latex microspheres. Additionally, IVDS technology measurements of a biomarker, the bacterial virus MS2, in aqueous solution, are at an accuracy level on par with the traditional size and concentration determination methods such as TEM and OD. Furthermore, it was shown that the data obtained from the use of IVDS technology could be used to accurately measure a third physical property, molecular weight, which was confirmed in this study using smallangle scattering (SAS).",
