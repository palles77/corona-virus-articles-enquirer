Understanding the transmission dynamics of the infection in each country which affected on a daily basis and evaluating the effectiveness of control policies is critical for our further actions. To date, the statistics of COVID-10 reported cases show more than 80 percent of infected had a mild case of disease, while around 14 percent of infected experienced a severe one and about 5 percent are categorized as critical disease victims. Today's report (2020-03-12; daily updates in the prepared website) shows the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran are 80932, 7869, 12462 and 10075; respectively. Calculating the total Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of Italy (2020-03-04), about 7.9% of confirmed cases passed away. Compared to South Korea's rate of 0.76% (10% lower than Italy) and China's 3.8% (50% lower than Italy), the CFR of Italy is too high. There are some effective policies that yield significant changes in the trend of cases. The lockdown policy in china and Italy (the effect observed after 11 days), Shutdown of all non-essential companies in Hubei (the effect observed after 5 days), combined policy in South Korea and reducing working hours in Iran.",

            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoV) which causes gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections, were first introduced by the discovery of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, from the nasal cavities of human patients with the common cold, in 1960s (Myint, 1994 1 4 ). The name refers to the morphology of the virus, when viewed under 2D transmission electron microscopy (large pleomorphic spherical particles with bulbous surface) and stems from the Latin word \"corona\", meaning \"crown\" (Goldsmith et al., 2004 5 ) . Concerning the risk factor, HCoVs vary significantly; from the relatively harmless ones (i.e., common cold) to the most lethal ones (MERS-CoV, with more than 30% mortality rate in the infected) (Fehr & Perlman, 2015 6 ). CoVs spread during cold seasons and cause colds with major symptoms, i.e., fever, sore throat, and less commonly pneumonia and bronchitis for the more aggressive strains. To date, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs capable of preventing or treating HCoV infections (Fehr & To date, several outbreaks of coronavirus-related diseases have been reported. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-or SARS was the first coronavirus-related outbreak, starting in Guangdong, China, in November 2002, and spread to a total of 29 territories, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States, within 9 months. It infected a total of 8,098 people and killed 774 worldwide (Smith, 2006 9 ). The second coronavirus-related outbreak happened in the Middle East in April 2012, officially named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS. This virus was first identified in a patient from Saudi Arabia, and later, MERS affected several other countries, including Saudi Arabia, South Korea, United Arab Emirate, Jordan, Qatar, and Oman. Overall resulting with infections in 24 countries, with over 1,000 cases and over 400 deaths (Organization 10 ). The outbreak of MERS happened again in South Korea, supposedly from a traveler from Middle East. It happened during May and July 2015, and infected a total of 186 individuals, with a death toll of 36 (Organization, 2015 11 ). After 3 years in August 2018, the next MERS outbreak happened in countries on the Arabian Peninsula, and resulted in almost 147 infected people and the death of 47. The MERS outbreak had been reported in Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, and South Korea. In Dec 2019, a pneumonia outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China, and on Dec 31, it was attributed to a new strain of HCoV, first named as 2019-nCoV by World Health Organization (WHO), and later renamed to SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Almost 2 weeks later, on Jan. 11, 2020, Chinese state media reported the first fatality from the new discovered virus, that led to infection of dozens more. As of Jan 20, multiple countries reported their first cases, including Japan, South Korea and Thailand. The first confirmed case in the United States came the very next day in Washington State. Continuing its spread, Coronavirus presence was confirmed throughout the month of February in the Philippines (Feb 2), France (Feb 14), Iran (Feb 21), and as reports started in Italy on Feb 23; many more Europeans countries followed suit, reporting their first confirmed cases. As of this writing, the coronavirus has affected 115 countries, out of more than 118,000 confirmed cases, around 4,000 people have lost their lives. With China, Italy, Iran, and South Korea experiencing the worst cases of outbreaks and showing no sign of alleviation, the 2019-2020 outbreak of COVID-19 is now officially recognized as a pandemic by WHO. An outbreak or epidemic often refers to a sudden increase in the occurrence of an infectious disease, in a particular time and place. Pandemics are near-global epidemic outbreaks, where multiple countries across the world are involved (Green et al., 2002 12 ). The mentioned rapid trend of spread prompts a lot of concerns and questions such as; \"How fast is the virus spreading?\", \"which policies or efforts could control the disease better?\", and \"what is the main difference of COVID-19 outbreak with pervious epidemics?\" Fortunately, the daily case detection changes are available and can be tracked almost in real time on the website provided by authors (http://iuwa.ir/corona/). The aim of this study is to provide the transmission trend from China to other countries and to report the daily confirmed cases, case fatalities and surveillance in every countries from the first day of outbreak until March 4th. Also, to evaluate the effect of each government policies in controlling the outbreak of COVID-19.",

COVID-19 categorizes in three distinctions concerning it's infected host's severity of disease 1516 . To date, the statistics of its reported cases shows more than 80 percent of infected had a mild case of disease, while around 14 percent of infected experienced a severe one, suffering from breathlessness and pneumonia. And about 5 percent are categorized as critical disease patients, their symptoms include septic shock, respiratory failure, and the failure of more than one organ. Reports on March 10 2020 show that China has the most confirmed, fatal and also recovered cases.

There is no evidence yet, about the relation of other conditions to the outbreak and its case fatality rate (CFR), so by using linear regression line, policies and behaviors could be compared. In the prediction cases, by using linear regression, we could compare future trends of countries in earlier stages, with the ones in later stages. By considering above mentioned statements, we will find the best linear relation between arrays of data. In some cases, the linear relation could be observed but it may exhibit linear relation with some date shift of others (i.e. death cases should have linear relation with earlier values of confirmed cases, given the fact that it should take time from confirmation to death.)

It could be observed in Fig. 2b which shows new cases for each day (and normalized in Fig. 2d ). The most reliable speculation for this jump is that in that day, China (the country with the most confirmed cases) for the first time, reported the clinically diagnosed cases in addition to laboratory-confirmed cases 17 , in which 13332 clinically diagnosed cases are added to 1148 laboratory-confirmed ones. Since then, China has kept the same reporting method for the confirmed cases. On 23rd and 24th of Feb, again the decrease of new cases subsided and new cases increased as before. As shown in Fig. 2a the reduction trend is continued (approximately) and the cause of the increase was other countries' growing numbers. So, for more accurate analysis each country will be investigated separately.",

By adding these two values, 11.6 days after Jan 24 (4th and 5th of Feb) the effects should be clearly manifesting. Figure 3b depicted the new daily confirmed cases of China outside of Hubei. The peak of the plot is located on Feb 13 and the daily new cases reduces afterward. This reduction shows that the lockdown plays a serious role in the further reduction of cases in China(excluding Hubei province). Even Though there is no reason to argue the lockdown's positive impact on Hubei itself, the decrease in new confirmed cases (Feb 13 increase's rationale was described in the previous section) shows that emergency circumstances and movement limitations yields positive results to the reduction of confirmed cases from 10th of Feb. Since February 13 2020, the Chinese government has issued shutdown of all non-essential companies, including manufacturing plants, in Hubei Province. 5 days later, on Feb 18, a drop of new cases could be observed (Fig. 3b) . Finally, the confirmed new cases in China were negligible from 1st of March.",

By observing normalized Hubei province plot of confirmed deaths and recovered cases in Fig. 3k , it could be seen that the CFR trend behaves the same as the confirmation, with a shift (In date). Visually, it could be seen that the value of shift in date varies and increases during this time. In earlier cases, the period of confirmation cases leading to death was shorter. It seems, one reason for this variation is, that confirmed cases consist only of just laboratory cases, and by adding clinically diagnosed cases (which existed before but didn't count beforehand) the time of confirmation to death increases. In other words, the number of confirmed cases gets closer to the real value, and the cases are announced sooner than they did before. Other possible reasons include, the advancements in developing treatments, further delaying fatal cases, and the increase in public awareness, as more people with possible signs of infection come forward to be diagnosed. To estimate the expected value of confirming a case up to the death stage, assuming a linear relation between the death and confirmed rates, we draw a linear regression line for confirmed and death cases' value, Each time increasing the duration and finding the mean absolute error (MAE) of the regression line. Normally, by increasing the duration, following the reduction in investigated points, the MAE is reduced. However if there is an obvious relation between these two parameters, at the point which they had a correlating relation, MAE will begin to increase (Fig. 4a) . Wang et al. estimated the time from the the appearance of first symptoms to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission 7.0 days, and to ARDS 8.0 days 20 . Another study, found that the median days from the first symptom to death as 14 (range 6-41) days 21 . As seen in Fig. 4c this value is about eleven in China (excluding Hubei province), Fig. 4e depicted the value 5 for Hubei and Fig. 4a depicted the value is 6 days for China. Assuming the hospital admission is the same day as confirmation (or a day before confirmation) the mean total of 14 days from the first symptom could be approved in 21 . By finding the mean day from confirmation to death, it is possible to find out the CFR in China, Hubei and China(excluding Hubei province) (algorithm 1 reports best shifting date value and best linear regression line ",

By comparing recovered cases with confirmed ones, a relation is observed after date shifts. Unlike death cases, recovered cases' shift are longer initially, and reduces over time. The assumed reasoning is that by the passing of time, more medical treatments develop, healthcare providers gain more experience in handling patients' care and as more people are informed, increasing numbers of them check in hospitals at the early stages of their disease, resulting in an even more efficient treatment. However this reduction doesn't break the linear relation between confirmed cases and recovered ones enough to be significant.

Comparison between the growth trend in numbers from South Korea from this date with China's in the early stages is depicted in Fig. 5e as shown the growth rate patterns are approximately the same between the two, showing a very similar behavior in the increasing numbers of confirmed cases. COVID-19 spreads from human to human 22 , therefore in addition to isolation of people, social avoidance and quarantine policies, faster detection of infected cases should reduce further growth.

The magnitude of this number clearly shows the policy of South Korea, an attempt to reduce the duration of detection, through a faster detection strategy 24 .

Owing to the fact that China has experienced the COVID-19 after these fitting trends, it is possible to predict South Korea's next trend, assuming South Korea's policies are as good as China's (Since other conditions like race and climate are comparatively the same ). As mentioned before, China on Feb 13 (22 days after the outbreak), added clinical diagnosis cases to laboratory-confirmed cases, so it seems appropriate to be considered in predictions, after normalization. Following the evaluation of the number of days shift, South Korea's confirmation rate behaves the same as China, resulting in the answer of 0.",

After day 14th, Italy exhibits incremental increase in confirmed cases juxtaposed to China's. March 10 (17th day of Italy's outbreak) being Italy's initial quarantine date, means it is too early to observe this policy's effects. Lombardy, the center of outbreak in Italy was locked down on February 22 and this lockdown strategy seems to have had a positive effect on other municipalities depicted in Fig. 6i and by comparing other municipalities confirmed cases with China's (The mainland) trend shown in Fig.6h , results seem identical. To analyze the stage of the disease in the Italian HCoV infected patients (i.e., to find out how rapid the infected people have been screened and diagnosed), the results of the COVID-19 tests of Italy and South Korea can be compared.

The reported death vs confirmed are too excessive at early days. It is possible that the shortage of COVID-19 testing kits or/and the lack of clinical diagnosis approach caused such unreliable data. Countries at this stage mostly had about 2 days of confirmation to death period, so following this assumption the COVID-19's CFR in Iran is around 4.4%. By observing the 24th of Feb's report, there were 49 active cases (The cases which are not recovered or dead but confirmed as a COVID-19 infected) reported (at least 14 cases are new) and the value for active cases in the next day was 79 (at least 30 new cases). Two days later, the reported recovered cases was 49. Supposing no one was treated in less than two days, this results in 100% recovery of 14 new cases in two days and also no active cases after two days, marking a great experience which was reported by Iran's officials. Otherwise, some cases were treated in one day. This makes Iran's phenomena intriguing for investigating the details and contributing factors for such cases in order to find a relation between individual's physical conditions and their treatment period. However, errors in report could also explain this information. Using regression line to find the mean recovered duration shows that the recovery duration for Iran should be around 1 day, Also seen in Fig. 7c , the rate of recovery in Iran is quite significant at 38% (keep in mind, Iran is in early stage of COVID-19's growth). Figures 7e, 7f, 7g and 7h show Iran's trends of confirmed, newly confirmed, death and new death cases respectively. The trends display no linear relation, Therefore in order to find the linear relation, we fit Iran's with China's first 10 days of confirmed, newly confirmed, death and new death cases respectively depicted in Fig. 7i, 7j, 7k and 7l . The 10th day after the outbreak, was the day in which new cases of china started to decrease. in Contrast, Iran's incremental trend continued to rise until the 20th day of the outbreak, Even Though a temporal reduction in new cases could be observed starting on 6th of March persisting until 9th of March. Evidently, it is the impact of a nation wide implemented policy reducing working hours 6 days prior (5.4 days is the mean incubation period 18 ). After 4 days, with the arrival of weekends and the following 2 additional holidays. Reports indicate, many people took trips during these dates which is widely assumed as a reason for confirmed cases' rise. Although many companies implemented forms of remote work for their employees (which is estimated to have a positive impact on preventing the growth outbreak), yet many governmental office working hours returned to their pre-outbreak times (naturally assumed to negatively impact the prevention of disease's spread ). There is yet no observable comparison between the effectiveness of either decisions, however the aggregation of effects could be seen from March 15. An important upcoming event in Iran is Nowruz which is the Iranian New Year, when traditionally, gatherings are very common, which could have very serious consequences on the outbreak of COVID-19 in Iran, prompting immediate and decisive preventive policies from the government.",

Mean age of Spain is 45 years old and hospital beds per person in the country is 29.65 for every 10000 (At 2013), compared to Italy the mean age of Spain is slightly smaller while hospital beds per person are relatively higher, consequently it is expected that the CFR should therefore be slightly lower.

Considering the mean age as a parameter, which in France is lower than Spain (42 and 45 respectively) in addition to beds per person which is 64.77 (At 2013) 27 (Higher than Spain) , CFRs are expected to be lower than Spain. By comparing the growth of confirmed cases with China, Iran, Italy and South Korea depicted in Fig. 10c , it's evident that although COVID-19 in France didn't exhibit a fast rate similar to Iran in the first 14 days of the outbreak, it is predicted however that the CFR will increase as much as Italy's.",

On March 10 both the confirmed and death cases of the USA increased (about 2.9 and 2.5 times respectively) The recovered cases also increased 2.1 times, but due to its low number of recovered (15 on March 10) we considered it trivial. The huge increase in death and confirmed cases lead the regression line algorithm to define confirmed to death duration in 0 days. However, it wouldn't be possible unless most dead cases are confirmed after death. Accepting the 3 days for the USA, like other countries in this stage, the CFR should be about 14% which is too high for a country with 38 years old mean age and 29 hospital beds per person. The high CFR could be alluded to the detection of the infected individuals during the last stages of the illness, or reporting on serious cases with higher CFRs exclusively. Compared to China, Iran, Italy and South Korea, both confirmed and death cases of the USA shows higher orders of incrementation. It is advisable to follow the USA in the coming days for more accurate information gathering, considering the latest increment could be caused by wrong data in the previous dates.",

Confirmed death cases lead in numbers by China and followed respectively by Italy, Iran, and South Korea. The daily statistics showed that lockdown are effective in reduction of incidence of confirmed cases with COVID-19 after about 11 days in china. South Korea, is one of the first countries reporting the cases after china and the growth pattern of confirmed cases is the same as China's in early stages. However, they implement some policies such as in addition to isolation of people, social avoidance and quarantine policies, and faster detection of infected cases which were effective in decrease in new confirmed case and also case fatality. Italy and China have the approximately same growth rate patterns for first 14 days. Although it is too early to observe quarantines policy's effects in Italy, lockdown strategy of Lombardy (the center of outbreak in Italy) seems to have had a positive effect on other municipalities. Unlike to china's growth pattern, Iran's incremental trend continued to rise until the 20th day of the outbreak, Even Though a temporal reduction in new cases could be observed due to a nation wide Implemented policy reducing working",

The case fatality rate in china was 3.8% (for Hubei was 4.4%). The highest and the lowest case fatality rate are belongs to Italy (7.9%)(and South Korea (0.76%), respectively. Which represent the effectiveness of their policies in control of the COVID-19. Social distancing was one of the most effective policies to control past epidemic disease by limitation human to human transmission and reducing mortality and morbidity ( 29 , 30 , 30 ) . However studies suggest that combination of multiple policies can boost the effectiveness. For instance, New York City Department of Health implement different policies during the influenza pandemic in 1918-19 at the same time and they have the lowest rate of mortality on the eastern seaboard of the USA 31 . During COVID-19 outbreak, researchers predicted that the mass movement of people at the end of the Lunar New Year holiday, would increase the spreading of disease. Facing this concern, government of china implemented policies which was helpful in control the disease such as, extended the holiday so the holiday would long enough to shelter the incubation period of COVID-19, isolation of confirmed cases in hospitals, quarantining mild or asymptomatic persons in different hospitals, home-based quarantine of people from Hubei province (epicenter of the epidemic), and the most important one was to prevent individuals with asymptomatic infections from spreading the virus.
