A low nucleotide sequence identity of the partial S gene was detected among the Korean PToVs (73.5%) and between the Korean and European PToVs (74.0%). Phylogenetic analysis of the spike and nucleocapsid genes showed that the Korean PToVs form distinct branches with clusters corresponding to the farm of origin, which were separate from the other known foreign PToVs. These findings suggest that genetically diverse Korean PToV strains cause sporadic infections in Korea.",

Bovine torovirus (BToV or Breda virus) was first detected in 1982 in the United States during an outbreak of neonatal calf diarrhea in which 15% of the affected animals died [23] .

Despite the impact of PToVs as enteric pathogens, there is a paucity of sequence and phylogenetic data on the PToV genes. Moreover, sequence data for PToV strains are limited to the S, M, HE, and N genes and have been reported only in European countries, including the Netherlands, Italy, and Hungary [12, 16, 18] . Therefore, it is still unclear if PToV strains circulating in other countries have distinct genetic characteristics. This paper reports the detection of PToV shedding in diarrheic piglets using RT-PCR and the genetic diversity of the spike (S), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of PToV strains circulating in Korea.",

Testing for parasite eggs (Coccidium spp. and Cryptosporidium spp.) was done using standard flotation techniques. For virologic assays, fecal suspensions of each sample were prepared by diluting the feces (1:10) in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2.

The strains from farm A also shared low nucleotide (74.0-74.2%) and deduced amino acid (73.2%) identities with the Netherland strain, Markelo. On the other hand, the strains from farms B and C had a high nucleotide (93.8-94.1%) and deduced amino acid (95.0%) identity with each other as well as with the Markelo strain (92.1-91.1% nucleotide and 92.5-95.5% amino acid identity) ( Table 1) . Alignments of the nucleotide sequences of the partial S gene showed that all of the PToV strains could be placed in the porcine phylogenetic lineage (Fig. 1a) . This agrees with a previous study in which three distinct torovirus genotypes of the S gene with apparent preferences for horses, cattle, and swine were identified [7, 8, 10, 18] . Moreover, the PToV lineage could be divided into two large clusters (Fig. 1a) , with the first cluster consisting of only Korean PToV strains from farm A and the other porcine phylogenetic cluster being composed of the three subclusters (strains from farms B and C and the Markelo strain) (Fig. 1a) . These results indicate that different PToV strains are circulating in Korea. In addition, nucleotide and deduced amino acid identities were considerably lower between the PToV S genes and those of equine Berne virus (63.0-64.6% nucleotide and 56.0-58.4% deduced amino acid identity) and between the PToV and BToVs strains (61.9-66.9% nucleotide and 55.7-62.8% deduced amino acid identity) ( Table 1) , supporting the idea that PToV strains are phylogenetically and genetically distinct from the BToVs and EToVs [7, 10, 18] . Since the Korean PToV strains from farm A showed relatively low nucleotide and deduced amino acid identity to other Korean strains and the Markelo strain, we sequenced the full-length S gene of one strain (07-56-22) from farm A and compared it with other known strains. The S gene of the 07-56-22 strain contained an open reading frame of 4722 nucleotides, which encoded a predicted S protein of 1573 amino acids. The 07-56-22 strain had comparatively low nucleotide and deduced amino acid identity to the PToV Markelo strain (86.4% nucleotide and 89.2% deduced amino acid identity). Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the S gene showed that the 07-56-22 strain belonged to the porcine lineage but formed a different branch, separate from the Markelo strain and other known bovine and equine strains (data not shown).",

As with sequence homology analysis, strains 07-56-14 and 07-56-23 from farm A were placed distantly with the other strains from same farm but clustered most closely with the PToV Markelo/Netherlands strain (Fig. 1c) .
