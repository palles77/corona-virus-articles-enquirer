Cholesterol depletion impairs virus assembly and infectivity. This study examined the effects of exogenous cholesterol addition (delivered as a complex with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbCD)) on the production of Molony murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) retroviral vector and HIV-1-based lentiviral vector pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G). Cholesterol supplementation before and during vector production enhanced the infectivity of retroviral and lentiviral vectors up to 4-fold and 6-fold, respectively. In contrast, the amount of retroviral vector produced was unchanged, and that of lentiviral vector was increased less than 2fold. Both free cholesterol and cholesterol ester content in 293-gag-pol producer cells increased with cholesterol addition. In contrast, the phospholipids headgroup composition was essentially unchanged by cholesterol supplementation in 293-gag-pol packaging cells. Based on these results, it is proposed that cholesterol supplementation increases the infectivity of VSV-G-pseudotyped retroviral and lentiviral vectors, possibly by altering the composition of the producer cell membrane where the viral vectors are assembled and bud, and/or by changing the lipid composition of the viral vectors.",

An important property of lipid rafts is that they preferentially include or exclude particular proteins to a variable extent. Two major transmembrane glycoproteins in influenza viruses, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, are raft-associated proteins [4] . Also, the lipid bilayer of HIV-1 virus contains GPI-linked proteins and ganglioside GM1, both of which are known to partition preferentially into lipid rafts [6] . Conversely, the non-raft protein CD45 is excluded from the lipid bilayer of HIV-1 viruses [6] . Other studies have shown that the HIV-1 Gag and Env proteins are raft-associated proteins [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

Cholesterol depletion can disrupt lipid rafts and abrogates the association of raft-associated proteins [13, 14] . Disruption of lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion hinders HIV-1 particle production from virus-producing cells, and cholesterol depletion from virus particles significantly impairs virus infectivity [8] . Depletion of cholesterol from target cells impairs HIV-1 virus infection by decreasing the mobility of HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5 on the cell surface [15] .

After centrifugation, lipid rafts and associated Gag protein floated to the top fractions of the gradient (Fig. 2) , which also contained the majority of the well-known lipid raft-associated protein calveolin (data not shown). Lipid rafts float to the top of the gradient because they are detergent-resistant microdomains (DRM) [8] .

Cholesterol supplementation after vector production had no effect on transduction efficiency using vectors from the 2nd collection. For supplementation after vector production, 0.03 mM cholesterol was added at 37 \u2022 C 1 h before transduction to viral vector produced under control conditions. For supplementation during transduction, cholesterol was added only during transduction. For supplementation during production, cholesterol was added to producer cells before and after transfection. All values were normalized to those under control condition at the 2nd collection, in which the same volume of viral vector produced without cholesterol supplementation was used to transduce the cells. Data points represent the mean \u00b1 S.D. (n = 2). addition. We found that for all collections the amount of p30 gag was very similar with or without cholesterol (Fig. 6) . Together with the increase in transduction efficiency, this suggests that the viral vector infectivity (defined as transduction efficiency per unit p30 gag ), rather than the amount of vector produced, increased with cholesterol supplementation. For culture with cholesterol, cholesterol was added at periods P + I + II (Fig. 1) . In (B) the amount of p30 gag (determined from densitometry analysis of immunoblots) in viral vectors with or without cholesterol supplementation for each collection was normalized to that of the 1st collection under control conditions. Data points represent the mean \u00b1 S.D. (n = 3). p = 0.26 for the 1st collection and p = 0.35 for the 2nd collection with or without cholesterol supplementation. To test if there was any difference in the stability of vector produced in culture with or without cholesterol, the viral vectors were incubated for different periods of time at 37 \u2022 C and then used for transduction. The results in Fig. 7 show that vectors produced with or without cholesterol supplementation decayed at a similar rate if the amount of vector prior to incubation at 37 \u2022 C yielded the same transduction efficiency. For both conditions, a higher transduction efficiency at time zero resulted in a smaller decay rate. This effect is to be expected because the transduction efficiency does not increase linearly with the amount of viral vector. In conclusion, the retroviral vector stability did not change with cholesterol supplementation during vector production.",

            "text": "To alter the composition of producer cell membranes, we supplemented growth media with cholesterol, a major component in lipid rafts, before and during MoMuLV vector production. The cholesterol content in the producer cells increased directly as a consequence of cholesterol supplementation (Fig. 9 ). Viral vectors produced with cholesterol supplementation had higher infectivity compared to those without cholesterol addition (Fig. 3) . Although depletion of cholesterol from virus-producing cells could disrupt lipid rafts, hinder viral particle production and decrease virus infectivity [5, 8] , the cholesterol amount in producer cells without cholesterol supplementation did not decrease during vector production (Fig. 9) . Thus, the supplemented cholesterol did not act by restoring its deficiency in producer cells. Rather, the increased cholesterol content increased the infectivity of vectors that were assembled and budded from rafts, possibly by altering cellular lipid raft composition. Consequently, it is also possible that the lipid composition of the vial vectors was changed similar to that observed by Beer et al. [21, 22] , and that this led to changes in viral vector membrane fluidity. It is known that lipid fatty acid composition tends to change to offset the associated change in membrane fluidity under certain circumstances such as low temperature [33] . In this case, increased cholesterol content might trigger a change in membrane fatty acid composition. It has been reported that the level of polyunsaturated species of the major cell membrane phospholipids increased with the incorporation of cholesterol as an adaptive mechanism to control the membrane fluidity [20] . This is consistent with a decrease in the saturated fatty acid (16:0) content in the major phospholipid (PC) with cholesterol supplementation in our study (data not shown). Another possible mechanism is that, by altering cellular lipid raft composition, a greater fraction of vector particles contained viral RNA during assembly and budding. If this were true, a higher percentage of viral vectors produced with cholesterol supplementation would become infectious compared to those without cholesterol addition.",

Similarly, there was no effect on transduction efficiency when we added cholesterol directly into the transduction medium. These results support the hypothesis that the beneficial effects on vector infectivity with cholesterol supplementation happen during the vector assembly process and/or during budding from the producer cell membrane, which has been shown by others to occur from lipid rafts on the producer cells. Cholesterol supplementation may increase the fraction of Gag protein associated with lipid rafts, as has been reported for influenza virus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase [12] .",

There was also a greater increase in vector infectivity with cholesterol supplementation for the lentiviral vector system. These differences may be due in part to the differences between the two production systems. The retroviral vector production system was transient and the producer cells were adherent. In contrast, lentiviral vector production was inducible and the producer cells were in suspension. There may also be an inherent difference for the different vectors.",
