Lower respiratory infections are caused by a wide variety of viral and bacterial pathogens. For pneumonia at least, sequential or concurrent polymicrobial infection may be relatively common, and the exact roles of individual microorganisms and how they interact in this context are still poorly understood. 10 , 11 The incidence of many respiratory infections follows a cyclical pattern aligned with the typical seasonal transmission of specific pathogens. Secular trends have also been noted for some vaccine-preventable infections, such as those caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b, with decreasing burden following the successful implementation of vaccine programs.",

Table 22 .15 outlines microorganisms that are regarded as part of the normal respiratory flora. [12] [13] [14] [15] Importantly, given the right conditions, some bacteria that can harmlessly colonize the respiratory tract may also be respiratory pathogens. As will be discussed further in this chapter, several microbiological diagnostic tests employed in the diagnosis of childhood respiratory disease have limited ability to differentiate between colonization and disease and are therefore of limited value when considered in isolation. RNA targets are converted into cDNA that is then amplified. This is needed for the amplification of RNA viruses (most common respiratory viruses).",

Ensuring high-quality collection of the right specimens is essential for making an accurate and interpretable laboratory diagnosis. A range of specimens can be used for identifying the microbial etiology of respiratory infections in children and are shown in Table 22 .12. Not all specimens are easily obtainable, and the diagnostic utility varies with each specimen type. The inability to obtain good-quality specimens from the lower respiratory tract is a fundamental problem with pneumonia diagnostics, and obtaining representative and uncontaminated specimens from the lungs is a challenge. Specimens collected by sputum induction or bronchoscopy may be contaminated by normal respiratory flora. Transthoracic needle aspiration is the best technique to obtain specimens from the site of infection in pneumonia, but it is performed in few centers despite a good safety profile. 16 Specimens should be collected as early as possible in the acute stage of an infection, preferably prior to administration of antimicrobial or antiviral drugs. During this period, higher pathogen concentrations are likely to be present; however, a diagnostic yield from culture ranging from 12% to 65% using different interpretative criteria. [32] [33] [34] The most rigorous evaluation of induced sputum for the diagnosis of pneumonia in children was performed as part of the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study. In this large study, there was no clear evidence that isolation of specific potential pathogens by culture or detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was associated with pneumonia case status. 35, 36 In addition, for PCR, there was no evidence that induced sputum provided additional evidence over and above testing a nasopharyngeal specimen. 36 In contrast, a recent longitudinal study from South Africa found that testing of induced sputum in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs provided incremental yield for detection of Bordetella pertussis and several respiratory viruses. 37",

Experience with large numbers of procedures at some locations has demonstrated the good safety profile of this technique. In The Gambia, which has the greatest experience with transthoracic lung aspiration in children, a review of over 500 lung aspirates over 25 years reported complications in six patients (all transient) and no deaths from the procedure. 16 Diagnostic yield with both culture and nucleic acid detection methods is appreciable, 16, 43 with about a two-fold increase in yield with nucleic acid detection over culture alone. 43 However, the interpretation of results from highly sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques needs to consider new concepts of the lung microbiome that question whether the lungs are normally sterile. Transthoracic needle aspiration is not indicated the duration of pathogen shedding depends on the microorganism involved and the severity of the infection and other factors. With uncomplicated influenza virus infections, virus shedding is usually 3 to 5 days following symptom onset; however, this may be extended in severe respiratory disease to 5 to 10 days. 17 Children may also shed for up to 10 days and many weeks in immunocompromised individuals.",

Nasopharyngeal aspirates are generally superior to swabs for the detection of respiratory viruses, since large numbers of respiratory epithelial cells are aspirated during the collection process. 18 However, aspirates are more difficult to obtain, especially outside the hospital setting, as they require a specific suction device. A range of commercial swabs are available, which include rayon tipped swabs and polyurethane sponges with wooden, plastic, or wire shafts. The availability of flocked nylon swabs, designed for the collection of respiratory samples, allows for the improved collection and release of respiratory epithelial cells and secretions from both children and adults. 19 Their use for obtaining nasopharyngeal specimens has been shown to have a similar performance to nasopharyngeal aspirates for the detection of common respiratory viruses in children, and the technique is relatively noninvasive. 20 Nasal or oropharyngeal samples are generally not recommended for routine diagnostic use. The combining of nasal and throat swabs has been trialed in children in hospital and community settings and shown to have a reduced sensitivity. 21 In general, viral loads are higher in the nasopharynx than in the oropharynx, but with some respiratory virus infections, avian influenza H5N1, for example, titers may be highest in the lower respiratory tract. There may also be a higher yield from throat swabs compared to other samples for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae. 22",

            "text": "Culture of sputum specimens is commonly used as part of the evaluation of pneumonia in adults. Despite difficulties with interpretation of results, 3 carefully collected and processed sputum specimens have been shown to be useful in some contexts. 23 Nonetheless, there is still ongoing controversy about the value of routinely examining sputum. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Furthermore, sputum microscopy and culture are not routinely performed in children due to difficulties in obtaining specimens in this age group who are typically unable to expectorate. 29 To overcome specimen collection problems, methods such as hypertonic saline nebulization have been used to induce sputum production. Induced sputum is now widely used to investigate lower respiratory infections in immunocompromised adults, especially for diagnosing Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, 30 and has also been used to diagnose pneumonia in children from settings with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. 31 However, few studies have collected induced sputum routinely from children with pneumonia. Recent studies of children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia from Finland, Kenya, and New Caledonia showed that collection of induced sputum was well tolerated, with Microscopy is also an important tool to assess the quality of lower respiratory samples, which itself has a large impact on the interpretation of culture results. 49 Specimens from the lower respiratory tract can be contaminated by upper respiratory secretions during collection. Also, a poorly collected \"lower respiratory\" specimen may be predominantly composed of upper respiratory secretions. Either situation can lead to incorrect interpretations of culture results. To overcome this issue, it is standard practice for diagnostic laboratories to assess the quality of lower respiratory samples before they are cultured. This typically involves assessing the number of squamous epithelial cells (SECs) and polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) in a Gram-stained smear of the specimen. 50, 51 The presence of low numbers of SECs and high numbers of PMNs per low-power field are regarded as being indicative of a high-quality specimen. 52 Conversely, specimens with relatively low numbers of PMNs and high numbers of SECs are likely to represent oropharyngeal contamination and are rejected for routine culture. Detection of a potential pathogen in such a specimen that is contaminated with oropharyngeal flora may represent nothing more than the patient's oropharyngeal microbiota. Table 22 .14 summarizes some commonly used criteria for assessment of lower respiratory specimens. Other rejection criteria have been described that also include the presence of PMNs, 51 and it is the responsibility of the laboratory to have a standard operating procedure that specifies rejection criteria. Although there is a paucity of data from children, quantity of SECs alone was demonstrated to be a useful quality measure for induced sputum from young children with pneumonia. 53 Notable exceptions to sputum rejection criteria are specimens for detection of Legionella spp. 54 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis; any specimen submitted for investigation of legionellosis or tuberculosis should be processed by the laboratory regardless of the specimen quality.",

For example, the presence of large numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes indicates an inflammatory response, while the presence of bacteria with characteristic morphology may provide an early indication of the culture result and give guidance about treatment. When performed by experienced microscopists, some findings can be very specific. For example, the detection of Grampositive cocci in clusters in a pleural fluid sample is highly suggestive of Staphylococcus aureus. The presence of a predominance of small gram-negative pleomorphic coccobacilli in a good-quality sputum sample is suggestive of infection with H. influenzae. Table 22 .13 lists the typical Gram stain picture of three commonly found pathogens.",

The usefulness of RADTs is limited by variable and often suboptimal sensitivity, typically 50% to 98% for RSV and 10% to 85% for influenza viruses, although specificities are generally high (80% to 100%). 63 , 64 The clinical usefulness of these tests is affected by disease prevalence, being poor when there are few cases in the community (positive predictive value is low and false-positive cases are more likely). During peak virus circulation, although the positive predictive value approaches 100%, the negative predictive value is lower and false-negative results are more likely. 65, 66 Due to concerns about poor sensitivity, most authorities recommend that RADTs for influenza are only used with caution outside the influenza season and only when a result will influence patient management; they emphasize that negative RADT results do not exclude influenza in patients with typical signs and symptoms. 67, 68 Other commonly used antigen detection assays for respiratory infections are those that detect S. pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigens in urine. These assays, typically in immunochromatographic test format, provide results within a short time frame, but are almost exclusively used on adults with suspected pneumonia. The specificity of currently used pneumococcal urinary antigen tests in children is poor, with frequent false positives due to nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae. [69] [70] [71] This has limited the clinical utility of this test in children, but there may be some value as a diagnostic adjunct in cases with radiologically confirmed pneumonia. There is considerable interest in the development of serotype-specific pneumococcal urinary antigen tests. [72] [73] [74] Early assessments in children indicate that these next-generation assays may have some diagnostic value, at least in epidemiological studies, but assay cutoffs need to differ from adults to distinguish between carriage and disease. 75 Pneumococcal antigen detection assays have also been successfully applied to pleural fluid samples in children with pleural effusion or empyema. 76, 77 A positive test result has high specificity in this context.",
