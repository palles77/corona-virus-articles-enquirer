The intensity of the signal with both types of probes decreased paraffin-embedded tissues.

Signal intensity and the REH buffer decreased hybridization time from 20 to 2 h without compromising the intensity or the hybridization time in ISH are probably impacted by the copy number of the target nucleic acids which quality of the hybridization signal.

Morphology of the cells was not impacted with either 2 h. One minor disadvantage of using the REH buffer for isotopic ISH was the slight increase in non-specific hybridization conditions is not known whether this methodology will work for the detection of DNA or with DNA probes as the incubation of samples at 90\u00b0C in a hot air oven for 15 min before hybridization with a RNA probe of 600 bond between RNA and RNA is stronger than that between DNA and DNA or DNA and RNA.
