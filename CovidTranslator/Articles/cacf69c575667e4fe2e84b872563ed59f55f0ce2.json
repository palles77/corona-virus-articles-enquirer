            "text": "Background: Commercial multiplex PCR panels for respiratory viruses (PRV) have been recently developed. ResPlex II Panel v2.0 (Qiagen), MultiCode \u00ae -PLx (EraGen Biosciences), and xTAG \u00ae (Luminex) PRV's were studied. All assays detect influenza A and B, adenovirus, parainfluenza 1-3, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, human metapneumovirus and human rhinovirus. The ResPlex II additionally detects coronavirus (229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1), coxsackie/echo virus, bocavirus and differentiates adenoviruses (B, E). The MultiCode-PLX assay detects 229E, OC43, and NL63, differentiates parainfluenza 4a, 4b and adenoviruses (B, C, E). The xTAG additionally subtypes influenza A as seasonal H1 and H3. Study design: 202 specimens collected from adult patients with signs of respiratory infection from November, 2008 to May, 2009 were used for evaluating the performance of the three commercial PRV assays. Viral culture and xTAG were used as the standards to assess sensitivity and specificity. Results: The PRV assays detected more viruses than culture. When compared to culture, the xTAG PRV showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 91%, compared to MultiCode-PLx with 89% and 87%, and ResPlex II with 89% and 94%, respectively. Co-infection was detected in a small subset of patient specimens. Each panel showed differences in sensitivities for individual viruses. Conclusions: While the ResPlex II and MultiCode-PLx offer a broader virus detection range and greater ease of use, the xTAG PRV showed increased sensitivity to common viral targets represented in the assays, and also had the ability to differentiate human from non-human influenza A H1.",

            "text": "Respiratory viral infections account for many hospitalizations and deaths in the US. 1 In addition to classical respiratory viruses, newly identified viruses, such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, bocavirus and, recently, 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, can cause significant morbidity and mortality. 2, 3 Rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory viral pathogens aids in antiviral therapy, and early diagnosis has the potential to reduce complications, antibiotic utilization and unnecessary laboratory testing. 4, 5 The development of sensitive molecular assays has increased the detection rate of respiratory viral pathogens. [6] [7] [8] [9] PCR and nucleic acid sequencing have shown greater sensitivity than Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) and culture tests. 10 Multiplex PCR assays can detect multiple respiratory viruses. 6, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] The xTAG \u00ae is one of the first multiplex PCR assays to be cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the detection of 12 different respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal specimens. Since then, additional com-mercial panels for respiratory viruses (PRV) assays have emerged. While comparative studies have shown that xTAG consistently performs better than other non-molecular assays, 16 a comparison of xTAG has not been published relative to other multiplex PRV assays.",

            "text": "As predicted, the PRV assays were more sensitive than viral culture. The xTAG showed the best sensitivity to common viral targets when compared to the ResPlex II and MultiCode-PLx assays. Previous studies have shown MultiCode-PLx to be highly sensitive in detecting FluA and other viral targets. 7, 8 In our study, the MultiCode-PLx detected some FluA's, FluB's and Adeno that were missed by culture. However, it missed 3 FluA's, 2 HRV's, and 2 RSVA's detected by the other PRV assays (Table 1) . Additionally, we encountered specimens that were positive for Para3 and 4 that were not confirmed by the ResPlex II, xTAG or by culture (data not shown). This may reflect low primer specificity for these agents. While the ResPlex II has been shown to have good correlation with DFA cross reactivity between Para1, 3 and 4 have been reported. 25 Internal control failures were noted with the ResPlex II as previously described 25 , but were minimal with xTAG or MultiCode-PLx assays. Compared to culture, it was as sensitive as the MultiCode-PLx, but showed higher specificity (Table 2 ). While parainfluenza cross reactivity was not observed, the ResPlex II did not detect some Para3's and RSVA's. When compared to the xTAG, the ResPlex II showed lower sensitivity than MultiCode-PLx. However, it depicted higher specificity (Table 3) . Overall, the xTAG showed the highest reproducibility with sensitivities and specificities comparable to values reported in the product insert. 19 In the specimens studied, we detected adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses. However, a more extensive evaluation of adenovirus serotypes is warranted due to lack of detection of all serotypes as per the product insert. 19 We detected a low rate of co-infections compared to previous studies. However the relative contribution of each potential pathogen is not clear at this time. 26 The number of targets and subtype differentiation varied for the 3 assays. The xTAG detects lower number of viral targets compared to the ResPlex II and MultiCode-PLx and does not differentiate adenoviruses, or Enteroviruses from HRV. Interestingly there were two cases where the MultiCode-PLx reported HRV and the ResPlex II reported CVEV. Because of the proprietary nature of the primers and probes, it is difficult to know if differentiation of HRV and Enteroviruses can be accomplished reliably. Sequencing was not performed due to lack of any remaining sample after testing with culture, the three PRV assays including discordant testing. The xTAG was the only assay to distinguish influenza A seasonal H1 and H3 subtypes. During the 2008-2009 influenza outbreak, a non-subtypeable influenza A (non-H1, non-H3) result was indicative for novel H1N1 influenza. [27] [28] [29] This proved to be very useful, saving valuable laboratory resources and time by not having to reflex to a second confirmatory assay.",

The assay complexity impacts turnaround time, influencing patient management. The ResPlex II generates results in 5.5 h, it is easy to perform, and only has one reagent preparation step and amplification step. Bead hybridization, detection, and reporting of results were the second step and they were performed in quick succession. On the other hand, the xTAG was the most labor intensive (7-8 h) due to five distinctive reagent preparations steps, two different thermocycler programs, and the complexity of the enzymes and reagents. While the xTAG and ResPlex II required only one thermocycler, the MultiCode-PLx required two thermocyclers, one for the reverse-transcriptase and the other for the Target-Specific-Primer-Extension that are performed in separate areas. In the MultiCode-PLx all post-amplification steps are carried out at room temperature without transfer or washings, and are completed in about 4-4.5 h. A drawback of these PRV assays is that they are open platforms and potentially prone to contamination.",
