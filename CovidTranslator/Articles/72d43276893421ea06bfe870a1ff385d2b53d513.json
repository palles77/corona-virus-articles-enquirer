We previously reported that the tightly regulated viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the positive-strand RNA virus Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) is degraded by the UPS in infected cells, a process that affects viral infectivity. Here, we show that the TYMV 98K replication protein can counteract this degradation process thanks to its proteinase domain. In-vitro assays revealed that the recombinant proteinase domain is a functional ovarian tumour (OTU)-like deubiquitylating enzyme (DUB), as is the 98K produced during viral infection. We also demonstrate that 98K mediates in-vivo deubiquitylation of TYMV RdRp protein-its binding partner within replication complexes-leading to its stabilization. Finally, we show that this DUB activity contributes to viral infectivity in plant cells. The identification of viral RdRp as a specific substrate of the viral DUB enzyme thus reveals the intricate interplay between ubiquitylation, deubiquitylation and the interaction between viral proteins in controlling levels of RdRp and viral infectivity.

The removal of Ub is catalysed by proteases generically named deubiquitylating (DUB) enzymes, most of which are cysteine proteinases (Nijman et al, 2005; Sulea et al, 2006) . Some of these enzymes catalyse the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, releasing Ub from its precursor forms. Most importantly, DUBs also cleave isopeptide bonds within poly-Ub chains or between the C-terminal glycine of the proximal Ub and the target protein, eventually leading to reversal of Ub signalling or to protein stabilization Reyes-Turcu et al, 2009) .",

The UPS is utilized not only by host cells in immunity and biotic stress responses, but can also be manipulated and subverted by pathogens-including viruses-for their own use (Shackelford and Pagano, 2005; Citovsky et al, 2009; Isaacson and Ploegh, 2009; Randow and Lehner, 2009) . Viruses are known to target Ub and Ub-like modifier pathways using various strategies, including the recruitment of host ubiquitin ligases or DUB enzymes (Querido et al, 2001; Yu et al, 2003; Yokota et al, 2008) . Interestingly, viruses also encode ubiquitin ligases (Boutell et al, 2002) and DUBs (Balakirev et al, 2002; Kattenhorn et al, 2005) . Although new insights into their biochemical activities and molecular structures have been gained in recent years (Sulea et al, 2006; Schlieker et al, 2007; James et al, 2011) , a major challenge in this field is now to define and understand substrate specificity, as well as the physiological roles played by these modulators of the Ub pathway during the infection cycle.",

            "text": "In this paper, we address this question using Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV), the type member of the genus Tymovirus. TYMV is a plant positive-strand RNA virus that has proven useful in the study of fundamental aspects of viral multiplication (Dreher, 2004) . We previously reported that TYMV-encoded proteins are targets of the UPS in vitro and in vivo (H\u00e9ricourt et al, 2000; Drugeon and Jupin, 2002; Camborde et al, 2010) . The 6.3-kb TYMV genomic RNA (gRNA) encodes two nonstructural proteins of 69 and 206 kDa (206K), the coat protein (CP) being expressed from a subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) produced during viral replication. 206K, the only viral protein required for TYMV replication, shares considerable sequence similarity with replication proteins of other ( \u00fe )RNA viruses (Buck, 1996) , and harbours domains indicative of methyltransferase (MTR), proteinase (PRO), NTPase/helicase (HEL), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activities. Self-cleavage of 206K by the PRO domain generates a C-terminal 66K protein encompassing the RdRp domain, and an N-terminal 140K protein that is further processed into 98K and 42K proteins (Prod'homme et al, 2001; Jakubiec et al, 2007 ; see Figure 9A ). The processing products assemble on chloroplast envelope membranes-the sites of viral RNA synthesis (Prod'homme et al, 2001 (Prod'homme et al, , 2003 Jakubiec et al, 2004 Jakubiec et al, , 2007 . Viral RdRp plays a pivotal role in the viral infection process, catalysing the synthesis of new viral RNA genomes from the original infecting RNA (Ahlquist, 2002) . We recently reported that TYMV 66K RdRp is a target of the UPS in infected plant cells-a process that affects the efficiency of viral replication (Camborde et al, 2010) .",

Both substrates were hydrolysed efficiently by TYMV WT PRO, as evidenced by the liberation of the highly fluorescent AMC ( Figure 1B ). The absence of cleavage of both substrates by the mutant TYMV PRO-C783S correlates the observed deubiquitylating activity directly with that of TYMV PRO, and supports assignment of Cys783 to the nucleophilic attack in this reaction. In accordance with previous reports (Lindner et al, 2005) , no Ub-AMC or Z-LRGG-AMC-hydrolyzing activity was detected when crude lysates from E. coli expressing TYMV PRO-C783S were used as the source of enzyme, thus indicating that TYMV PRO is solely responsible for the DUB activity detected in crude extracts of E. coli. Crude cell lysates from E. coli transformed with pGex-PRO (WT PRO; lanes 1 and 2) or pGex-PRO-C783S (lanes 5 and 6) before (N) and after (I) induction with IPTG, and fusion proteins (P) obtained after purification on glutathione Sepharose 4B (lanes 3 and 7) were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. The molecular mass (kDa) of marker proteins (lane 4) is shown on the left. (B) Progress curves of TYMV PRO-catalysed hydrolysis of Z-LRGG-AMC and Ub-AMC. Purified enzyme (2 mg) was incubated in 1 ml Assay buffer in the presence of 100 mM Z-LRGG-AMC or 114 nM Ub-AMC at RT. Reaction progress, monitored by the increase in fluorescence emission at 440 nm (ex \u00bc 380 nm) that accompanies release of AMC, was converted to AMC concentration and plotted versus time. The activity of TYMV PRO was tested at different substrate concentrations, and plotting initial velocity measurements against substrate concentration ( Figure 1C ) allowed determination of the pseudo first-order rate constant, kapp (which approximates kcat/Km for non-saturable enzymes). TYMV PRO hydrolysed Z-LRGG-AMC and Ub-AMC with kapp values of 12.8 \u00b1 3.9 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 and 1550 \u00b1 320 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 , respectively, indicating a strong preference for the ubiquitin substrate over the peptide substrate.",

Strikingly, the amount of ubiquitylated 66K appeared drastically reduced when 66K was co-expressed in the presence of TYMV 98K ( Figure 6B, lane 4) or 140K (i.e., 98K protein precursor) (lane 6). Interestingly, this effect was reversed upon mutation of the catalytic C783 residue (lanes 5 and 7), indicating that the Ub conjugates of RdRp 66K are indeed targeted by the DUB activity of its replication partner, the 98K protein. No 66K-Ub conjugates were detected upon infection with TYMV RNA, consistent with 98K targeting 66K during viral infection (Supplementary Figure S1) .",

In this system, a test protein is produced as a translational fusion to a stable reference protein separated by a Ub monomer. Such fusions are cleaved rapidly and precisely at the C-terminus of Ub by cellular Ubspecific processing proteases, yielding equimolar amounts of the test and reference proteins ( Figure 8A ). We previously reported the metabolic stability of 66K can be determined by transfecting cells with the expression vector pO-CAT:66K-LUC in which chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) serves as the internal control, and luciferase (LUC)-N-terminally fused to the 66K protein-serves as the test protein, with the LUC/CAT activity ratio reflecting the instability of the test protein (Camborde et al, 2010) . As shown in Figure 8B , we observed that expression of 98K led to the stabilization of 66K, a process that appeared to be dose dependent. Interestingly, this effect was partially reversed upon mutation of the catalytic C783 residue, as expression of the 98K-C783S or 98K-C783A mutants was found to affect 66K stability to a lesser extent than the wt 98K, as determined by comparison of samples expressing identical levels of wt or mutated 98K (P \u00bc 0.0001) ( Figure 8C ).",

Previous characterization of 206K processing has identified two cleavage sites, at the PRO/HEL and HEL/POL junctions ( Figure 9A ; Kadar\u00e9 et al, 1995; Bransom et al, 1996; Jakubiec et al, 2007) . Introducing the C783S mutation into the E17 transcripts corresponding to the full-length copy of the TYMV genome abolishes viral infectivity completely (Jakubiec et al, 2007) . However, this effect was attributed to the fact that cleavage at the HEL/POL junction is absolutely required for TYMV infectivity, as shown by mutagenesis studies affecting the HEL/POL cleavage site (Jakubiec et al, 2007) .",

Interestingly, we observed that co-expression of 98K led to a decrease in the amount of 66K poly-Ub conjugates present in plant cells ( Figure 6B ), and to a subsequent increase in 66K metabolic stability (Figures 7 and 8) . As both features were affected by the C783S mutation shown to abolish DUB activity, we conclude that the 98K DUB activity indeed has the ability to interfere with the 66K RdRp polyubiquitylation process, and contributes to regulating its degradation. This effect is independent of the phosphorylation status of 66Kreported previously to influence 66K stability slightly (Jakubiec et al, 2006; Camborde et al, 2010) , as 66K phosphorylation appeared not to be affected by the co-expression of 98K protein (Supplementary Figure S2) .",

In particular, as 98K was shown to be a membrane-associated protein that recruits 66K to the chloroplast envelope vesicles where TYMV replication takes place (Prod'homme et al, 2001 (Prod'homme et al, , 2003 , 98K-dependent recruitment to membranes and subsequent compartmentalization might also help protect 66K from degradation.

However, we consider it surprising that tymoviruses would encode a polymerase bearing a degradation signal previously identified as a PEST sequence in the N-terminal non-catalytic domain of the protein (H\u00e9ricourt et al, 2000; Camborde et al, 2010) that is deleterious to viral replication, together with a viral DUB to prevent its degradation, when proteasomal degradation could be avoided easily by mutation of the PEST sequence during virus evolution. Therefore, we rather favour the idea that the virus has evolved to take advantage of ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation events to regulate its life cycle.",

The spatial (compartment specific) or temporal degradation of the RdRp may thus constitute yet another regulatory mechanism, and we propose that the viral DUB plays a critical role in that process, offering a new way to finely tune viral RNA replication. The analysis of 66K ubiquitylation status in the early steps of viral infection may help clarify this point, but the low level of 66K produced has so far precluded such analyses.",

Arabidopsis protoplasts were transfected with pO-66K, pO-myc 2 -Ub, alone or together with pO-98K, pO-98K-C783S, pO-140K or pO-140K-C783S as indicated. Cells were collected 48 hpt, and samples were immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions with anti-66K antibody. Samples were then normalized according to the amount of 66K and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-myc antibody. Arrowhead Position of 66K. The molecular mass (kDa) of marker proteins is shown on the left. The amount of 66K present in the immunoprecipitates was determined by immunoblotting with anti-66K antibody, and the amount of 98K or 140K derivatives present in the cell lysates was determined by immunoblotting with anti-98K antibody.",
