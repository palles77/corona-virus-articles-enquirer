Air travel has resulted in a vast increase in trips from the developed to the developing world over the past decade. Visits from developed countries to Africa, the Americas and Asia increased by over 60% between 2000 and 2007 and are predicted to continue to increase by approximately 6% per year. Each year, over 100 million travellers from non-tropical regions will visit a developing country (see World Tourism Organization Facts and Figures), with up to half of these travellers developing a health problem abroad. Many of these travellers will become symptomatic during their trip, and in some instances they will carry infections such as measles, influenza and dengue fever back to their country of origin, potentially resulting in local epidemics of infection 1 . In addition, travellers may develop potentially life-threatening illnesses, such as malaria, while abroad, resulting in substantial morbidity and sometimes death 2, 3 .",

            "text": "In order to develop a more comprehensive and representative evidence base for the development of optimal preventative strategies and guidelines for international travellers, an accurate measure of the incidence of health problems among travellers is essential. The best available approximations of attack rates for various illnesses in international travellers, including infections that are preventable with the use of vaccines, have come from several disparate studies 4, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . These estimates are useful but do not reflect attack rates of illnesses according to the specific destinations visited, nor do they account for changes in illness risks over time. Detailed, up-to-date information could perhaps best be gained from large multi-centre prospective cohort studies, but such studies are difficult to perform, are extremely costly and must be repeated frequently if disease trends are to be followed [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . An alternative approach is to analyse multi-centre data on the illnesses that are acquired by a broad range of travellers who are visiting regions on all continents, such as the data that are collected by international surveillance networks like the GeoSentinel network 25 and TropNetEurop 26 . There are several differences between these two networks; most notably, the focus of TropNet is on Europe and the diagnostic categories are restricted to malaria 2,27,28 , dengue fever 23, 29 and schistosomiasis 30 , whereas GeoSentinel is global and collects data on a wider range of diseases. This Science and Society article focuses solely on the experience of the GeoSentinel network and reviews the main findings of several key studies that have contributed to defining the range of infections in international travellers. An indepth discussion of the methodologies that are used in GeoSentinel studies, and their associated limitations, has been recently published 31 . This Science and Society article provides a complementary guide to understanding the research that is carried out by the GeoSentinel network.",

Almost 25,000 travellers were included from a total of almost 55,000 reports collected from 31 GeoSentinel sites worldwide. Of the study participants who had a systemic febrile illness, the most common aetiology was malaria, accounting for 59% of all diagnoses. Other common diagnoses were acute diarrhoeal illnesses, respiratory tract infections (including influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis and tonsillitis), dengue fever, rickettsial infections (with tickborne spotted fevers accounting for 75% of rickettsial infections) and typhoid fever. A regional analysis provided a useful guide of the proportionate morbidities of these infections according to the region of travel (FIG. 2b) . Malaria accounted for most febrile Data are collected at individual sites from patients with a travel-associated illness who present to a GeoSentinel clinic, and they are sent to the central database (which is maintained by the International Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM) at the CDC, Atlanta, USA) using a web-based reporting system. Quarterly reports are generated centrally, using collected data, and circulated back to GeoSentinel sites. Rare and alarming reports (such as avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and haemorrhagic fever) trigger a rapid query response that is sent to the reporting site for further clarification and to all sites to notify them of such an event. The data are also made available to GeoSentinel sites to conduct research but only following a stringent project application process. Finally, GeoSentinel provides reports based on travel-associated illness and events data collected through the network to third-party groups such as C u t a n e o u s le is h m a n ia s is C u t a n e o u s la r v a m ig r a n s S t r o n g y lo id ia s is A s c a r ia s is",

Travel to Africa was more likely to be associated with acquiring malaria than dengue fever. In a study involving over 1,100 travellers who acquired malaria over a 5-year period, the GeoSentinel network provided new insights into the travel characteristics that are associated with malaria acquisition 3 . Plasmodium falciparum malaria accounted for 60% of all diagnoses, whereas Plasmodium vivax malaria was diagnosed in 24%. Five percent of travellers with malaria had travelled for 1 week or less and 32% had travelled for 1-4 weeks, demonstrating that even travel of short duration can be associated with the acquisition of malaria. The disease was also more frequent in individuals travelling to visit friends and relatives than in other groups of travellers, highlighting this group as one requiring more intensive efforts in malaria prevention. Death due to malaria was infrequent (occurring in only 0.2% of the malaria sufferers who reported to GeoSentinel), but cerebral malaria occurred in 2.4% of indivi duals with a P. falciparum infection and severe complicated noncerebral malaria occurred in 1.4% of all ",

Diagnoses of parasitic versus bacterial infections were also reported, with Campylobacter, Salmonella and Shigella being the most common bacterial pathogens and Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica and Strongyloides stercoralis being among the most frequent parasitic isolates 61 (FIG. 4) . As a follow-up to this initial study, a comprehensive analysis of the specific microbial pathogens that are responsible for gastrointestinal infections in different regions of travel has recently been published by the GeoSentinel network 62 . This information serves not only to help give preventative advice before travel but also to direct the assessment, diagnosis and management of returned travellers with gastrointestinal disorders. For example, the data show that travellers to Southeast Asia should be provided with antimicrobials that will be effective against Campylobacter and giardiasis. Similarly, travellers returning from South Asia with a gastrointestinal illness should be carefully assessed for protozoal and bacterial infections, both of which occur frequently.",

Not unexpectedly, travel during the winter of the destination country was associated with the acquisition of influenza, but travel during autumn was associated with an increased odds ratio for acquiring bronchitis and lower rTIs. This was of particular significance for travellers visiting friends and relatives, who were more likely to be diagnosed with influenza than other travellers, whereas pneumonia and bronchitis were comparatively less likely in business travellers than in other travellers. This report highlights the differences in the risks of acquiring rTIs, especially influenza, in different groups of travellers. Most current vaccination strategies against rTIs target influenza rather than other pathogens, but these findings can serve to guide diagnostic and management decisions in returned travellers presenting with an rTI. These findings were reinforced by another prospective analysis that reported an influenza attack rate among international travellers of 1.2% 64 . The findings of the GeoSentinel study 33 perhaps hold the greatest importance for influenza prevention among travellers. For example, the data show that it may be prudent to target travellers visiting the Northern Hemisphere between the months of December and February for vaccination to reduce their risks of acquiring influenza and of possibly carrying new strains of the virus back to their home countries.",

            "text": "Despite the advantages of a standardized multi-centre data collection tool to help understand the relative risks of illness acquisition according to specific traveller and itinerary characteristics, GeoSentinel was not specifically designed as a research tool and there are a number of inherent limitations in the types of analyses that arise from the data collected through the network. Firstly, the data fields that are collected are limited -for example, data are not systematically collected on the prophylactic vaccines that are administered or the malaria chemoprophylaxis that is provided. Secondly, GeoSentinel sites are located primarily in academic centres, so it is likely that the patients referred to these centres are those with more severe or prolonged illnesses or those that have travelled to destinations that are perceived as being 'risky' , and they will therefore not represent all travellers. In addition, there are selection and reporting biases in the types of patients and types of diagnoses that present at these specialized clinics. Non-specialized primarycare practices would presumably be likely to see more mild or self-limited conditions than the GeoSentinel clinics, and diseases with short incubation periods that manifest during travel (such as diarrhoea and influenza) are also likely to be under-represented. Thirdly, the patient intake at each site is likely to reflect local or national differences in the make-up of the travelling population and access to medical care. In addition, the type of accommodation, eating habits and other risk behaviours during travel may reflect the national and cultural background of the traveller, so the proportionate contribution of individual sites needs to be taken into account. These factors are important confounders that result in a notable selection bias for inclusion in the database, and this limits the ability to generalize the findings of analyses of GeoSentinel data. Fourthly, the geographical dispersion of GeoSentinel sites precludes centralized laboratory testing for all patients, so absolute uniformity in diagnostic criteria and recording across all GeoSentinel sites cannot be guaranteed.",

Consequently, those who have remained well or who have had a shortlived illness during travel and who have not required medical follow-up will not be represented. GeoSentinel data can therefore not be used for incidence rate calculations or for the determination of absolute risks for the individual traveller.",

The data collected represent standardized longitudinal data from multiple global sites and can complement other research approaches to incrementally inform optimal pre-and post-travel disease management. Another important role of such networks is to facilitate communication between participating sites, which enables rapid dissemination of up-to-date information among clinical care providers. The studies performed by GeoSentinel have helped our understanding of the more common infections that are encountered by travellers. Other studies have focused on infections like schistosomiasis 71 , dermatological conditions in travellers 72 , animal bites in travellers 15 and the problems of specific groups of travellers such as those who are visiting family and relatives 35 . As the body of data collected by the GeoSentinel network continues to grow, the breadth of studies emerging from GeoSentinel will undoubtedly also grow to provide a useful source of information for the development and implementation of effective travel health guidelines.",
