Since 2004, three emerging diseases have been added as mandatory report diseases: hand, foot, and mouth disease in 2008; influenza A H1N1 pdm09 in 2009; and human infection with the avian influenza A H7N9 virus in 2013. Excluding these three new diseases, the overall incidence of the remaining consistently reported diseases, estimated by a joinpoint regression model, 3 showed a two-stage feature of opposite changes. In the first stage, the overall rate of reported infectious diseases rose rapidly in 2004-06, with an annual percentage change of 8\u00b79%, which is probably attributable to the improved sensitivity of the surveillance system by the adoption of a new webbased reporting approach since the SARS outbreak. 1 In the second stage, the overall trend showed a slight reduction with an annual percentage change of -0\u00b77% in 2007-13. Whether or not the three newly added diseases are considered, the pattern of the overall trend of infectious disease occurrence showed significant differences between the two stages (figure). Unfortunately, this fact was overlooked in Yang and colleagues' report, 2 but should be noted by readers .",

Furthermore, the disease has spread beyond these regions into new areas at more northerly latitudes, including northern Italy 2 and Madrid, Spain. 3 Like visceral leishmaniasis, canine dirofilariasis, which is caused by mosquito-transmitted filarial worms, is also often diagnosed in southern Mediterranean regions. Until 1999, most cases in human beings originated from Italy, France, Greece, the real overall incidence of parasitic diseases declined constantly. 7 Under the leadership of the national and local governments and implementation of a one-health strategy, along with close joint multisectoral collaboration between the departments of health, agriculture, and the environment, some parasitic diseases have reached or approached elimination status. The elimination of filariasis throughout China was certified in 2007 by WHO. Furthermore, the goal of nationwide malaria elimination by 2020 was established, and schistosomiasis is close to being eliminated.",

After the SARS outbreak, intensified actions have been taken in China to reduce the burden of infectious diseases, such as substantial investment in public health, capacity building for laboratory testing, surveillance system enhancement, national intervention programmes for specific diseases, and maintenance of a close collaboration with international partners. 1 Since the implementation of these efforts, how has the situation developed regarding infectious disease epidemics in China? What can the world learn from China's approach to infectious disease control? What role can China play in global public health?A study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases 2 addressed these issues and aimed to explore the epidemic features during the first decade after the SARS outbreak (2004-13) by analysing surveillance data on 45 notifiable infectious diseases. In their Article, 2 Shigui Yang and his colleagues reported that the overall incidence of infectious diseases in China has maintained an increasing trend (annual percentage change 5\u00b79%). Of 45 notifiable diseases, 20 presented a striking decreasing trend, while ten other diseases continued to rise. What are the implications of these comprehensive findings on various diseases?",
