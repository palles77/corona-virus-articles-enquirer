SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS. The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection. Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia. SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emergent disease that was first reported in Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China, in November, 2002, from where it spread to other Asian countries, North America, and Europe. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] By July 3, 2003, this epidemic had resulted globally in 8439 reported cases, of which 812 were fatal. 6 Pulmonary lesions in SARS patients have been diagnosed as diffuse alveolar damage. Histological changes include desquamation of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membranes, flooding of alveolar lumina with oedema fluid mixed with inflammatory cells, and the presence of enlarged pneumocytes and syncytia. Alveolar walls are thickened by mild mononuclear infiltrate, and in later stages air spaces contain fibromyxoid-organising exudate. 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 Coronaviruslike particles have been detected by transmission electron microscopy in cells from a lung biopsy sample 2 and a bronchoalveolar lavage sample, 7 and in pneumocytes from a postmortem lung sample. 8 Until now, immunohistochemical detection of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in SARS-associated lesions has not succeeded. 7 Identification of the causal agent of SARS is essential to make an accurate case definition, to diagnose the disease accurately, and to develop appropriate preventive and curative treatment. Several agents have been proposed in the course of investigation of SARS. During initial investigations in China, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia sp were suggested as possible causes. 9, 10 Subsequent studies ruled out these agents and other known viral and bacterial pathogens, 3,4 except for human metapneumovirus. 5 A previoulsy unknown coronavirus was identified in patients with SARS. 2, 7, 11 It was suggested that this coronavirus, alone or in combination with human metapneumovirus or other causal agents, might be the primary cause of SARS.",

Macaque 2 had respiratory distress, consisting of an increased respiratory rate and dyspnoa, from day 4 after infection onwards. Macaques 2-4 had multiple foci of pulmonary consolidation in both lungs. The consolidated lung tissue was grey-red, firm, level, and less buoyant than normal. The tracheobronchial lymph nodes and spleen in these macaques were about twice the normal size. The other organs in these three macaques, as well as the respiratory tract and other organs of macaque 1 were normal on microscopic inspection. The main lesion in the consolidated pulmonary tissue of macaques 2-4 involved the alveoli and bronchioles, and consisted of areas with acute or more advanced phases of diffuse alveolar damage. In such areas the lumina of alveoli and bronchioles were variably filled with proteinrich oedema fluid, fibrin, erythrocytes, and cellular debris, a moderate number of alveolar macrophages, and fewer neutrophils and lymphocytes (figure 1). The cytoplasm of some of these macrophages contained erythrocytes or pools of oedema fluid. There was extensive loss of epithelium from alveolar and bronchiolar walls. In areas with more advanced diffuse alveolar damage, the alveolar walls were moderately thickened and lined by cuboidal epithelial cells (type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia), and the alveolar lumina contained mainly alveolar macrophages (figure 1). Regeneration of epithelium was seen in some bronchioles, visible as one irregular layer of squamous to high cuboidal epithelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. In some areas, the alveolar walls were lined by deep eosinophilic hyaline membranes (figure 1). There were occasional multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) in bronchioles and alveoli, either attached to the wall or free in the lumen (figure 1). These syncytia had up to about 30 peripheral nuclei, abundant hyaline eosinophilic cytoplasm, and, based on positive CD68 staining and negative pan-keratin staining, originated from marcophages. Enlarged type 2 pneumocytes with large vacuolated nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant vesicular cytoplasm were frequently found attached to the alveolar walls (figure 2). The epithelial origin of these cells was confirmed by keratin expression (figure 2). By contrast, alveolar macrophages had smaller nuclei, less prominent nucleoli, and were generally loose in the alveolar lumina (figure 2). The identity of these cells as macrophages was confirmed by CD68 staining (figure 2). Alveolar and bronchiolar walls were thickened by oedema fluid, mononuclear cells, and neutrophils. There were aggregates of lymphocytes around small pulmonary vessels. Moderate numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages were present in the lamina propria and submucosa of the bronchial walls, and a few neutrophils in the bronchial epithelium.",

The SARS patients in cohort 4 co-infected with human metapneumovirus were mostly health-care workers from the same ward and who shared resting areas. The circulation of this infection among them during the SARS outbreak probably explains the frequency of the infection in cohort 4. Similarly, four SARS patients from Canada were infected with SARS-CoV and human metapneumovirus. 5 The clinical symptoms of human metapneumovirus infection vary from mild upper-respiratory-tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. 24 The possible role of human metapneumovirus infection in exacerbating SARS remains to be assessed.",

Syncytia also were prominent in the alveoli of SARS patients. 3, 7, 8 Based on expression of CD68 and pan-keratin, the syncytia were of histiocytic origin in macaques (this study), and of histiocytic or epithelial origin in SARS patients. 8 The formation of syncytia in these macaques may have been induced by SARS-CoV infection, because some syncytia were positive for SARS-CoV by immunohistochemistry, and the spike protein of coronavirus induces cell to cell fusion. 20 Pneumocytes showing cytomegaly, enlarged nuclei, and prominent nucleoli were common both in SARS-CoV-infected macaques (this study) and in SARS patients. 2, 8 Such enlargement and cytologic atypia of hyperplastic type 2 pneumocytes occurs commonly in organising diffuse alveolar damage, and is non-specific. 27 The development of a specific immunohistochemical test to identify SARS-CoV antigen in histological samples allowed us to assess the cell tropism of SARS-CoV infection in macaques. Expression of SARS-CoV in the lung was restricted to pneumonic areas and localised to the cytoplasm of type 2 pneumocytes and syncytia. The infection of type 2 pneumocytes by coronavirus was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. These findings correspond to the detection of coronavirus-like particles in pneumocytes of a postmortem lung sample of a SARS patient, 8 and with the tropism of respiratory coronaviruses in pigs and rats for respiratory epithelium, and occasionally alveolar macrophages. 25, 26 On the basis of histological changes, SARS-CoV infection in the macaques primarily affected the epithelium of alveoli and bronchioles. At the time of euthanasia, 6 days after infection, most pneumonic areas showed early to advanced type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, indicating repair of alveolar walls after loss of type 1 pneumocytes. The temporal sequence of the histological changes corresponds with that of experimental infection with porcine respiratory coronavirus in pigs, in which acute changes (loss of epithelium, presence of macrophages and fibrin in airway lumina) were seen at days 2-6 after infection, and more advanced changes (type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration) were seen from days 7-11 after infection. 26 Because diffuse alveolar damage from different causes follows a common pathway, 27,28 more chronic changes in these macaques probably would have included organisation of the intra-alveolar exudate, resulting in alveolar fibrosis and bronchiolitis obliterans, as seen in SARS patients who died later in the course of disease. [3] [4] [5] The development of fibrosis is dependent on the deposition of fibrin in the alveoli rather than on the continued presence of virus infection. Onset of fibrosis is a critical feature of chronic diffuse alveolar damage, because it leads to loss of alveolar function and is irreversible. 27 In respiratory coronavirus infections in pigs and rats, viral infection of respiratory epithelium is maximum at days 3-4 after infection, and is no longer measurable by days 6-9. 25, 29 The rapid disappearance of infected cells after initial infection might explain why SARS-CoV was not found in type 1 pneumocytes, and was only occasionally found in type 2 pneumocytes in these macaques. It also might decrease the chance of detecting SARS-CoV by immunohistochemistry in postmortem lung tissue of SARS patients who die after a protracted course of disease.",

Presumably, this difference is due to the gradient in the transcription of coronavirus RNA, with high concentrations of nucleoprotein RNA and low concentrations of polymerase RNA. 20 Collectively, these results of laboratory studies of SARS patients and experimental infections of macaques prove that the newly discovered SARS-CoV is the primary causal agent of SARS. Based on histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of postmortem tissues of these macaques, SARS-CoV infection primarily affects epithelium of the lower respiratory tract, with potentially severe consequences for respiratory function.",
