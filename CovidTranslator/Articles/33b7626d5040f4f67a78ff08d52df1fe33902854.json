The disease was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). A novel coronavirus, isolated from the respiratory secretions of patients, has been implicated in the causation of SARS. The modes of transmission include droplet spread, close contact, and Fomites; shedding of virus from respiratory tract is the primary mode of transmission. SARS clinically presents with high-grade fever, chills and rigors, myalgia, headache, cough with or without sputum production, dyspnea, and dizziness. Chest radiographs reveal unilateral or bilateral, predominantly peripheral, areas of consolidation progressing with in a short time of bilateral patchy consolidation. Preliminary reports suggest a milder illness in young children. The case definition of probable SARS cases, laboratory investigations and precautions for prevention of spread are discussed.

Viral RNA concentrations in sputum were noticed to be high, suggesting that the shedding of virus from respiratory tract is the primary mode of transmission 2.

Electrolyte abnormalities in the form of hypenatremia and hypokalemia have been observed in a few patientsY A recent study on 75 adults with SARS has observed that the fever and pneumonia initially responded to treatment) However, patients developed recurrent fever (85.3%) on day 8.9 _+ 3.1 (range 4 to 18), watery diarrhea (73.3%) on day 7.5 _+ 2.3 (range 3 to 15), radiological deterioration (80%) on day 7.4 _+ 2.2 (range 3 to 13) and respiratory deterioration (45.3%) on day 8.6 + 3 (range 5 to 19). In 45.3% of patients, marked improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was closely associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites. Twenty percent progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during the third week. Quantitative RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (4 had ARDS and 10 without ARDS) consistently demonstrated a peak viral load at day 10 and a decrease to admission level at day 15. This suggests that deterioration during the second week was not related to uncontrolled viral replication but may rather be related to immunopathological damage. ~ Data on children is limited. Hon et al have described the clinical features in 10 children from Hong Kong. 8 Two distinct patterns of clinical presentation among the children were observed. Teenaged patients presented with symptoms of malaise, myalgia, chill, and rigor similar to those of adults, whereas the younger children presented mainly with cough and runny nose, and none had chills, rigors, or myalgia. The clinical course was much milder and shorter among younger patients, and radiological changes were milder and generally resolved more quickly than in the teenagers. All pediatric patients had clinically important lymphopenia, but it was more severe among the teenage children.",

Infection control measures for inpatients should include: 1. Standard precaution (e.g. hand hygiene); in addition to routine standard precaution, health-care personnel should wear eye protection for all patient contact. 2. Contact precautions (e.g. use of gown and gloves for contact with the patients or their environment). 3. Airborne precautions (e.g. an isolation room with negative pressure relative to the surrounding area and use of an N-95 filtering disposable respirator for persons entering the room).If airborne precautions cannot be fully implemented, patients should be placed in a private room, and all persons entering the room should wear N-95 respirators. If N-95 respirators are not available for health-care personnel, surgical masks should be worn. Regardless of the availability of facilities for airborne precautions, standard and contact precautions should be implemented for all suspected SARS patients. the outpatient setting: If possible, suspect SAILS patients on arrival to the outpatient or ambulatory setting e.g. clinic or Emergency Department (ED), should be evaluated in a separate assessment area to determine if they meet the case definition for suspected SARS and require isolation. A surgical mask should be placed on the patients, if possible.All health-care personnel should wear N-95 respirators (95% filter efficiency) while taking care of patients with suspected SARS. Precaution should be used when evaluating or transporting (e.g. emergency medical technicians), or in any ambulatory health-care setting (e.g. Emergency Department or clinic personnel). If N-95 respirators are not available, personnel should wear surgical masks.",
