If these clinically infected HCWs can be identified as pandemic influenza infections, they would not need to continue receiving prophylaxis. The result is that some prophylaxis doses may be saved; and these saved doses may potentially be redistributed to the other non-clinically infected HCWs, prolonging prophylaxis beyond the planned duration. For example, if we originally stockpiled for 6 weeks of prophylaxis, and some HCWs could stop prophylaxis because they were clinically infected prior to the start of or during prophylaxis, then some doses could be saved and redistributed to other HCWs. This prolongs the duration of prophylaxis beyond the original 6 weeks. We have performed analyses to explore this scenario, although this is only possible if tests can promptly confirm individual infection and logistics networks allow for prompt redistribution. To address this issue from another angle, we explored the number of prophylaxis doses used at the end of the planned duration of prophylaxis for the various scenarios (based on R 0 ) if those who are clinically infected can be identified and prophylaxis stopped.",

The actual difference in timing and duration is probably less than a day for influenza since symptoms start on the same day as detectable viral shedding (2) , and we hence assumed the same value (and corresponding symbol) to describe the incubation and latent periods in our study.",

At higher R 0 of more than 4, the epidemic progresses so quickly (about 6 weeks duration) that prophylaxis stockpiles will be sufficient to achieve their intended effect. The key scenarios of concern are those with R 0 between 2.5 to 4, as mis-timed prophylaxis can substantially exacerbate the effects of the outcomes. Under these scenarios, 4 to 8 weeks of prophylaxis can either be subtantially more or less effective in reducing peak absenteeism compared to treatment only.

This is because each combination of R 0 and management strategy affects the outcomes on varying the input parameters. Certain input parameters such as efficacy of prophylaxis and effectiveness of treatment are not applicable to the strategies of treatment and no action, and were therefore excluded during analyses for the respective strategies. To facilitate interpretation on the effect of prophylaxis, we present results for sustained prophylaxis for the entire pandemic duration. Hospitalization and case fatality rates were scaled together based on their distributions, with the upper and lower limits fixed for both variables in a distribution centered on the mean.

To account for this, we defined a set of epidemics based on their growth rates, \u03b6, corresponding to R 0 = 2.0 to 4.0 with a latent period, \u03b1, of 2 days and an infectious period, \u03b3, of 4.1 days.

Figure A1 explores the sufficiency of treatment stockpiles for different R 0 . The outcomes of varying the percentage of infected individuals receiving treatment (due to limited stockpiles) lie progressively between the outcomes under no action and full treatment of all infected HCWs. Table A1 compares peak absenteeism for HCW prophylaxis with re-distribution and without re-distribution (fixed pre-planned duration) of the prophylaxis doses. Redistribution of prophylaxis doses had none or only a marginal effect (in a few scenarios) on reducing peak absenteeism. Table A2 shows the number of prophylaxis doses used at the end of the planned duration of prophylaxis for the various scenarios (based on R 0 ). For lower R 0 (\u22642.5) or shorter pre-determined durations of prophylaxis (\u22644 weeks), more than 90% of prophylaxis stocks were utilised by the end of the pre-determined duration of prophylaxis. For higher R 0 (\u22653) or longer pre-determined durations of prophylaxis (>8 weeks), less stocks were used but re-distribution of prophylaxis did not reduce peak absenteesim (Table A1 ) since pre-planned durations would already have been adequate. For the important scenarios (scenarios where an incremental increase in prophylaxis duration resulted in a sharp decrease in peak absenteeism as shown in Table A1 ), prophylaxis doses utilized remained above 93%. Table A3 shows the treatment and prophylaxis doses required under the various strategies for the base case scenario (R 0 =2.5). Prophylaxis doses constitute the overwhelming majority of the doses required for prophylaxis strategies of 4 weeks and above. The number of treatment doses required decreased for longer durations of prophylaxis, but the number of treatment doses saved under the different prophylaxis strategies is relatively negligible considering the number of prophylaxis doses required.",

In addition, 33% of infected HCWs would be asymptomatic (base-case assumptions), and will not require treatment. Finally, to achieve suppression of peak absenteeism, the treatment stockpile only needs to cover slightly past the epidemic's peak; further treatment during the tail end of the epidemic will not have any effect on the peak.
