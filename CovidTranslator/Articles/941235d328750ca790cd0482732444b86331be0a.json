In both cases, a relatively small event hit a system and fear spread, ultimately resulting in enormous damage. \"These similarities are no coincidence\", Haldane noted. \"Both events were manifestations of the behaviour under stress of a complex, adaptive network.

The most basic cause of interdependence between firms and financial institutions is through the lending and borrowing of money. One example is the interbank market, which banks use to manage demands for cash by shuttling funds among themselvers, often overnight. This process creates a dynamic network of banks linked through the interchange of funds. One of the early alerts of the 2008 crisis was the freezing of this market, as a result of an evaporation of mutual trust on which such lending depends.",

But the truth behind systemic risk is more subtle. For example, a recent study 6 demonstrated that the position of an institution in the banking network is equally and sometimes more important than its size. To identify the systemically most important institutions, Battison et al. 6 defined a new measure: DebtRank, inspired by Google's PageRank algorithm, by which the search engine ranks webpages. They found that a group of 22 financial institutions, which received most of the loans issued by the US Federal Reserve from 2008 to 2010, had become more central to the network, meaning that the default of any one of them would have a large economic impact on the whole network. Moreover, in November 2008 -at the peak of the financial crisis -DebtRank scores for the largest 20 or so banks show that simple bank size isn't as important as we have come to think. Institutions such as Barclays, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and the Royal Bank of Scotland presented more systemic risk than did Citigroup or Deutsche Bank, despite being significantly smaller in total assets. Wells Fargo stands out even more: it presented as much systemic risk as Citigroup, despite having only a quarter of the assets.",
