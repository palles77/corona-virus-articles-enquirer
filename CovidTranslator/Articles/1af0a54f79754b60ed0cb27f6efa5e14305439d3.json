The autonomic nervous control of epithelia is less well known and less well studied. However, a large number of histochemical reports on autonomic nerves have in great detail described autonomic fibres innervating epithelial cells. The mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract, for example, is provided with an extensive nervous supply from the enteric nervous system (ENS; Furness and Costa, 1987) . During the last two decades experimental evidence for an involvement of these nerves in the pathophysiology of diarrhea has accumulated.",

This is followed by a description of the experimental evidence for the involvement of ENS in secretory states of the gut, primarily in cholera toxin-induced secretion which is the most thoroughly investigated secretory state. The involvement of ENS in rotavirus diarrhea is then discussed. Finally, the involvement of the ENS in diarrhea pathophysiology opens up new potential sites of action for drugs in the treatment of intestinal secretory states.",

This was recognized already by Langley (1921) in his classical monograph in which the ANS was divided into three major parts: the sympathetic, the parasympathetic and the enteric nervous systems. This view is again gaining acceptance since both morphological and functional studies of the ENS clearly suggest that the ENS can function as an independent part of the ANS. The morphological evidence for such an independent function is rather clear-cut. There are almost as many neurons in the ENS as in the spinal cord (Furness and Costa, 1980) . This enormous number of neurons in the gastrointestinal wall is controlled by very few efferent fibres from the central nervous system. In fact, there is on average one efferent nerve fibre for 300 enteric neurons (Agostoni et al., 1956; Kuo et al., 1982) . The functional evidence for an independent role of the ENS is also well established. It has been known for some time that the intestinal peristaltic reflex functions in the absence of any connections with the central nervous system.",

The ground plexus is easily demonstrated in the vascular wall where the innervation forms a plexus situated at the outer boundary between media and adventitia. Hence, the anatomical relationship between autonomic nerves and the cells controlled by the nerves is much less defined than the nervous control of skeletal muscle where one particular nerve fibre makes contact with a particular muscle fiber at the motor-end plate. In the gastrointestinal tract bundles of smooth muscle cells are controlled by a ground plexus. Similarly, the intestinal epithelium is controlled by a ground plexus situated just underneath it. The nerve fibres of the ground plexus have a beaded appearance. The beads contain varicosities in which the neurotransmitters are located and from which they are released into the so-called synaptic cleft.",

The transmitter attaches to the appropriate receptor on the postsynaptic plasma membrane. The transmitter can also be degraded by enzymes in the synaptic cleft, as will be discussed below in relation to the treatment of rotavirus diarrhea. In the case of adrenergic (neuron with noradrenaline as neurotransmitter) and cholinergic (neuron with acetylcholine as neurotransmitter) neurons it is well established that there are re-uptake mechanisms that transport the transmitter \"back\" into the neuron from which it was previously released. Finally, there are receptors on the presynaptic membrane via which a negative feedback on the release of the transmitter is exerted (\"autoregulation on neurotransmitter release\"). This implies that an increased concentration of a transmitter in the synaptic cleft diminishes the release of that particular transmitter.",

            "text": "It is now well established that neurons may contain more than one neurotransmitter (colocalization). In the ENS the number of putative transmitters in a single neuron is sometimes very high, some neurons containing up to seven putative transmitters. As pointed out above the ENS control of mucosal functions is to a large extent exerted by neurons with their somas in the submucous plexus. The most common among these neurons is the DYN/GAL/VIP neuron (for explanation of abbreviations, see Table 1 ) which constitutes 45% of all submucous neurons in the guinea pig small intestine. The corresponding figures for the other types of neurons are ChAT/DYN/SP: 10%; CHAT/ CCK/CGRP/DYN/GAL/NPY/SOM: 30%; CHAT: 15% . ChAT (choline acetyltransferase) denotes the probable presence of acetylcholine in a neuron. It should be underlined that there may exist species differences (see e.g. Ekblad et al., 1991; McConalague and Furness, 1994) . Morphologically, the neurons of the submucous plexus are, with one exception, monopolar, i.e. they have one long axon (Dogiel type 1). The ChAT/DYN/SP neuron, on the other hand, has two long axons (Dogiel type 2) connecting the mucosa with neurons in the myenteric plexus, the soma of the neuron being located in the submucosa. It is possible that this neuron is sensory, conveying afferent impulses from the mucosa to the myenteric plexus, a proposal also supported by electrophysiological observations (Bornstein et al., 1989; Bertrand et al., 1997) . Table 1 Established and putative neurtransmitters of ENS The functional implications of the colocalization of transmitters in the ENS are not well known. In many neurons one substance seems to have a major role in transmission while others have subsidiary or modulatory roles. Experimental observations indicate that the peptidergic transmitters are released from the neuron at higher rates of firing than the nonpeptidergic cotransmitter (Lundberg, 1981) . Some neurons contain transmitters that seem to have opposite effects on the effector cell. This raises the question of whether some of the immunohistochemical findings are artifacts and/or whether the techniques used are so sensitive that they detect transmitter concentrations which are functionally unimportant. Bowers (1994) has proposed that large numbers of peptides in one and the same neuron can be explained by mechanisms of gene regulation implying that peptides of no functional importance may be produced by cells.",

The S cells have a comparatively low resting potential and do not exhibit any hyperpolarizing after potential. The studies by Hirst (1979) suggested that the All cells do not obtain any input from other neurons whereas the S cells do.

Interesting functional differences between the cholinergic and non-cholinergic submucosal neurons have then been revealed, the input to the two types of neurons being quite different. To exemplify, the extrinsic sympathetic adrenergic nerve fibres seem to make contact with the non-cholinergic but not with the cholinergic mucosal neurons. With regard to the enteric control of the epithelium, the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic neurons in the submucosa (a DYN/GAL/VIP neuron) are of particular interest, since fluid and electrolyte transport may be controlled by such neurons. These neurons are influenced by cholinergic, fast EPSPs induced by nerve cells located in both the myentetic and submucosal plexus, the major portion emanating from myentetic neurons.",

            "text": "The textbook view of the pathophysiology of cholera secretion is that the fluid loss from the intestinal mucosa is explained by the toxin (via increases of intracellular cAMP), inhibiting the absorption of sodium chloride in the villus enterocytes by interfeting with the Na+/H + and/or CI/HCO 3antiports. Furthermore, the toxin evokes a chloride secretion from the crypts by its direct action on the crypt cells. This model is mainly based on in vitro experiments, but observations made in vivo argue against this view. Firstly, using labelled cholera toxin it has been shown that the toxin does not reach the crypts when administered into the intestinal lumen (Weiser and Quill, 1975; Hansson et al., 1984) . Secondly, a marked hyperosmolality (of about 700 mOsm) has been demonstrated in cat villi in the face of net fluid secretion induced by exposing the mucosa to cholera toxin (Hallb/ick et al., 1979) . The prerequisite for a fluid uptake by villi is therefore present also in cholera. Hence, the toxin does not reach the crypts and villi are functioning more or less normally. Yet, the toxin evokes a net fluid secretion. This paradox can be explained by the toxin activating the ENS. The experimental evidence for the involvement of ENS in the pathophysiology of cholera is extensive and has been obtained mainly from in vivo experiments on extrinsically denervated intestinal segments of cats and rats. The results of these experiments can be summarized as follows: (1) Tetrodotoxin (TTX; blocker of sodium channels in excitable cells) injected intraarterially to cats inhibits the intestinal fluid secretion evoked by cholera toxin (Cassuto et al., 1981 a) . (2) Hexamethonium (nicotinic receptor antagonist) given intravenously to rats turns cholera secretion into absorption (Cassuto et al., 1982a) . Concomitantly, the increase of transepithelial potential difference (PD), caused by the toxin, is significantly attenuated (Tantisira et al., 1990) . (3) Lidocaine (local anesthetic) administered luminally or on the serosal surface reverses cholera secretion to fluid absorption and attenuates the increased PD (Cassuto et al., 1981a (Cassuto et al., , 1983 Tantisira et al., 1990) . (4) Kirchgessner et al. (1992) monitored the activation of ENS neurons with a histochemical method using an antibody to thefos oncogene product the expression of which has been shown to be a marker of nervous activity. Exposing the intestinal mucosa to cholera toxin activated neurons in both the myenteric and submucosal plexuses. (5) Cholera toxin-induced secretion is accompanied by an augmented release of VIP, a neurotransmitter, into the venous effluent. Giving TTX attenuates both the VIP release and the fluid secretion (Cassuto et al., 1981b) . Atropine (blocker of acetylcholine receptors on effector cells) had no effect on cholera secretion (Cassuto et al., 1982a) , inferring that the transmitter at the effector cell probably is a peptide, presumably VIP. (6) Cholera toxin cannot elicit a secretory response in intestinal segments in which the myenteric plexus has been destroyed by exposing the serosal surface to benzalkonium chloride (Jodal et al., 1993) .",

Two to four weeks later, when the nerves distal to the severing have degenerated, an acute experiment is performed on the animal. Sj6qvist (1991) showed that chronic denervation did not attenuate the effects of cholera toxin on net fluid transport in the small intestine of the rat, suggesting that the effect on fluid transport is not mediated via an axon reflex arrangement involving thin afferent nerve fibres.",

A model for this is presented in Fig. 3a . It should be underlined that this model represents the simplest model that can be proposed on the basis of the current experimental observations. According to the model of Fig. 3a the secretory reflex activated consists of three neurons. The ChAT/DYN/SP neuron mentioned earlier probably represents the sensory afferent neuron in the reflex although this is not firmly established. The effect of the nicotinic receptor antagonist hexamethonium suggests that there must be a cholinergic synapse in the secretory reflex. This is indicated by the cholinergic interneuron in the model of Fig. 3a .

Similarly, in experiments in which the lumen of intact intestinal segments were perfused in an organ bath, tetrodotoxin, lidocaine and hexamethonium significantly lowered the monitored PD and often turned fluid secretion into fluid absorption in virus-infected intestines. Finally, giving lidocaine repeatedly intraperitoneally to awake mice inoculated with rotavirus significantly prevented the fecal losses of fluid. From the results obtained in vitro it was calculated that at least two thirds of the fluid and electrolyte secretion caused by the virus could be ascribed to an activation of the ENS.",

            "text": "Indirect evidence for the involvement of the ENS in human rotavirus infection comes from studies with enkephalinase inhibitors. Opiates have since long been known to inhibit intestinal fluid and electrolyte secretion as well as gut motility. The endogenous opiates, the enkephalins, are found in enteric nerves as neurotransmitters. It seems probable that there are enkephalin receptors on enteric neurons. Thus, there are several studies that demonstrate that there are enkephalin receptors on myenteric neurons the stimulation of which inhibits the nervous release of acetylcholine (see e.g. Nakayama et al., 1990) . Furthermore, indirect experimental evidence for a point of action for enkephalins in the ENS was provided by Eklund et al. (1988) who demonstrated that methionine-enkephalin given into the superior mesenteric artery caused a parallel reduction in cholera toxin induced net fluid secretion and VIP release into the intestinal venous effluent in cats. This nervous action of enkephalins can be enhanced by inhibitors of the enzymes degrading the enkephalins, the enkephalinases. In line with this the enkephalinase inhibitor acetorphan has been shown to attenuate acute diarrhea in children and adults (Hamaza et al., 1999; Turck et al., 1999; Lecomte, 2000) . Finally, Salazar-Lindo et al. (2000) showed in a clinical trial that acetorphan (Racecadotril\u00a9) markedly inhibited stool output in young Peruvian children with rotavirus diarrhea (See also Bass, Section I, Chapter 5 of this book).",

For example, the pharmacology of the secretory reflex involved has not been studied. The reflex of Fig. 3a is mainly derived from studies of enterotoxins and, in particular, cholera enterotoxin. Although it seems possible that rotavirus evokes intestinal fluid and electrolyte secretion via a similar nervous reflex this has to yet to be demonstrated. Another major question is how virus can activate enteric nerves. In the case of bacterial enterotoxin-evoked fluid secretion it has been proposed that enterotoxins induce the release of amines/peptides from the endocrine cells of the intestinal epithelium via their effects on intracellular second messengers. To exemplify, several lines of evidence indicate that cholera toxin causes the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) from the enterochromaffin cells (Jodal and Lundgren, 1995; see Fig. 3b ). Alone or together, the secreted amines/peptides activate nervous dendrites located underneath the intestinal epithelium. It seems possible that rotavirus per se and/or the recently discovered rotavirus enterotoxin NSP4 may function in a similar manner by increasing the intracellular calcium concentration (Tian et al., 1994; Ball et al., 1996; Fig. 4) . Fig. 4 also illustrates another mechanism that may explain how rotavirus activates the ENS. It is now recognized that epithelial cells function as \"sensors\" for microorganisms. For example, when exposed to bacteria the cells release a wide range of biologically active compounds, such as cytokines, prostaglandins and nitrous oxide (Kagnoff and Eckmann, 1997) . These compounds also participate in the inflammatory response. It is established that receptors located on enteric neurons exist for some of those substances and that they, alone or together, may cause a membrane depolarization of dendrites to induce action potentials (Kirkup et al., 2001) . For a detailed discussion of all the mechanisms underlying rotavirus diarrhea, the reader is referred to a review by Lundgren and Svensson (2001) .",

It relies on an intact absorptive capacity of the intestinal epithelium. It would be advantageous if the oral glucose-salt solution could be combined with a drug that attenuated the intestinal secretion of fluid. The involvement of the ENS in the pathophysiology of intestinal secretory states opens up new potential sites of actions for drugs in the treatment of diarrhea. In Fig. 3 a number of possible sites of intervention in the secretory reflex(es) are indicated by numbers. Intestinal secretion evoked by diarrheal agents that activate the ENS via the intestinal endocrine cells can be influenced by drugs that decrease the amine/peptide release from those cells (site number 1; see also Fig. 4) . Thus, it has been demonstrated that fluid secretion evoked by cholera toxin or bile salt can be significantly attenuated by calcium channel blockers of the L-type via an effect on release of 5-HT from the EC cells (Timar Peregrin et al.,1997a ,b, 1999 Other sites for pharmacological interventions are receptor(s) on the nerve dendrites for the substances released from the endocrine cells and/or enterocytes (site number 2 in Figures 3 and 4) . In line with this proposal it has been shown that 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists may attenuate cholera toxin-induced secretion (Cassuto et al., 1982b; Beubler et al., 1989; Sj6qvist et al., 1992) . According to the hypothesis illustrated in Figures 3b and 4 it may also be possible to attenuate cholera toxin and rotavirus fluid secretion using blockers of various peptide receptors as well as by blocking those biologically active compounds released from the enterocytes. This has not yet been tested experimentally.",

Most of the animal experimental work has been performed using CT. (a) The intramural reflex activated by the secretory agent is proposed to be made up by three neurons. The transmitter of the afferent neuron is not established. As discussed in the Text the interneuron is probably cholinergic and the efferent neuron releases vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) at the effector cell. (b). Illustration how an enterotoxin, such as CT may activate the enteric nervous system by releasing peptides and/or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) from the endocrine cells of the mucosa (indicated in Fig. as cell containing granules). It is possible that rotavirus also causes the release of amines/peptides via its effect on intracellular calcium concentration. It should be emphasized that the Fig. is highly schematic. The nerves activated by peptides and/or 5-HT are situated underneath the intestinal epithelium as depicted in more detail in Fig. 4. For a detailed discussion of the model, see Text.
