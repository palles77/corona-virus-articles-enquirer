            "text": "Acute upper respiratory infections (URI), including common cold, is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in humans. Although the disease is usually mild and self limiting, symptoms may last for one to two weeks and it is one of the leading causes of doctor visits and missed days from school and work with enormous economic impact. On average, adults suffer from about two to four colds a year, whereas children have about six to ten episodes. [1] According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 22 million school days are lost annually due to upper respiratory infections. [1] Most of the upper respiratory infections are viral in origin. The commonly identified culprit viruses were rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus and metapneumovirus. [2] There is currently no targeted antiviral for URI. Various medications currently available in the market are mainly for alleviation of symptoms but had not been associated with shortening of symptoms. World J Emerg Med, Vol 8, No 1, 2017 Lui et al Commonly used medications include antipyretics, antihistamines and alpha-adrenergic agonist. [3] The use of antipyretics had evidence of effectiveness in all age groups. [4] Decongestants and perhaps decongestant/ antihistamine combinations in adolescents and adults had scientifi c evidence to show modest benefi t to reduce rhinorrhea, sneezing and nasal obstruction in first 2 days. [5] First generation antihistamines have shown favorable effects upon nasal symptoms in some of the adult studies, probably because of their anti-cholinergic effects. [6] However, the use of common cold preparations including antihistamines in children aged younger than 5 is not evidence-based. In the current primary practice in the locality and worldwide, prescription of common cold medications and antihistamines are very common, particularly in the private practice. In a survey by English et al, [4] 26% of patients younger than age 5 were given a prescription that was not evidencebased and potentially harmful. Most of the prescriptions were extrapolation from the evidence in the adults. The unnecessary medication prescription had also signifi cant cost implication and accounted for 60% of the total prescription cost in a family practice clinic. In Hong Kong, prescription of antihistamine was nearly universal among primary practice, and prescription of double, or even triple antihistaminergic agents for URI was common. The potential adverse side effects, risks and complications may probably be additive or synergistic for multiple simultaneous antihistamine ingestion.",

For the paediatric age group, systematic review had shown that use of antihistamine would have modest effect on relief of nasal symptoms in first 2 days but not in mid or long term symptoms. [5] Furthermore, the use of common cold medications such as codeine may be associated with adverse drug effects and even mortality. [7, 8] The frequency of adverse effects of antihistamines in pediatric patients were not well studied. It may be crucial to evaluate the current prescription practice of the frontline doctors, the prevalence of antihistamine prescription, and explore the associated factors for antihistamine prescription. Currently there is very limited data in the literature assessing the prevalence of antihistamine prescription, and there is no local prevalence data about the prescription of antihistamine agents among primary practitioner and emergency physicians.",

The regional hospital served a population of above a million people living in the New Territories region of Hong Kong and had a diversified clientele with daily AED attendance of about 600 patients. About a quarter of the patients were in the paediatric age group (aged less than 18). Upper respiratory infections were one of the most commonly encountered clinical problem in the emergency department. In our study, all consecutive cases of paediatric patients aged 6 or below who presented to the AED during a study period of one week from April 1 to July 4, 2009 with diagnosis of acute upper respiratory infection were included. The eligible cases were searched from the hospital electronic record database by the Clinical Data Analysis & Reporting System (CDARS), which is a computerized data retrieval system of the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong utilizing International Classification of Disease Coding, Ninth edition (ICD-9). We searched the diagnosis under the categories of principal and secondary diagnoses. The included ICD-9 codes were 462 (acute pharyngitis), 463 (acute tonsillitis), 381 and 382 (acute otitis media), 460 (acute rhinopharyngitis), 465, 465.9 and 212.9 (non-specific upper respiratory infection). All patients aged more than 6 years were excluded. Patients with diagnosis of acute bronchitis, chronic nasopharyngitis and allergic rhinitis were excluded. Patients who were admitted to hospital in the same attendance and those with labeled history of drug allergy to antihistamines were also excluded. All patients with other medical conditions that justify the use of antihistamines were also excluded. Relevant clinical information were collected from electronic patient record and written clinical record. All case records were retrieved and then reviewed by the principle investigator.",

            "text": "Although some randomized controlled trials of older first-generation antihistamines have shown positive results for certain end points in adult studies, [5, 6] a Cochrane review concluded that antihistamines had only modest relief of nasal symptoms in fi rst 2 days but not afterwards. [5] Even if a slight clinical benefit exists, there are risks and adverse effects, especially with fi rstgeneration antihistamine. [11] Table 3 summarizes the efficacy of individual first generation antihistamines in relieving symptoms in paediatric URI in various trials. The Cochrane systematic review also concluded that antihistamines in monotherapy, in children as well as in adults, do not alleviate nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and sneezing, or subjective improvement of the common cold to a clinically significant extent. First generation antihistamines also cause more side-effects than placebo, in particular they increase sedation in cold sufferers. [5] Newer-generation non-sedating antihistamines do not have effi cacy on relieving cough symptoms. [12] Currently, no medication available in the market had been shown to effectively treat cough in upper respiratory infection in children. [13, 14] Antihistamines are heterogeneous groups of compounds with various side effects. Use of antihistaminergic agents is not without risks. As reported by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC), approximately 7 100 patients aged under 12 years were treated in emergency departments for adverse drug events from cough and cold medicines in children in US. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] A n t i h i s t a m i n e s a r e c o m m o n l y k n o w n t o h a v e depressant effects on the central nervous system, although occasional paradoxical stimulant effects had been reported, particularly among children. These include tremor, insomnia, irritability, hallucinations and seizure. [21, 22] Although diphenhydramine has been used for treating oculogyric crisis and acute dystonic reactions, dystonia had been reported following use of antihistamine such as chlorpheniramine and diphenhydramine. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] The exact mechanism is not well defined, but several hypothesis have been proposed. Diphenhydramine is a phenothiazine derivatives and phenothiazine had antidopaminergic activity, causing imbalance in central cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission. [30] Other hypothesis include rebound increases in nigral inhibition of the basal ganglia and involvement of the aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter system have been postulated. [30] [31] [32] Furthermore, apparent life-threatening events have been associated with use of common cold medications. [33] In January 2007, the CDC published a report describing three deaths of infants aged <6 months of age for which cough and cold medications were determined to be the underlying cause of death. [34] From the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 69 fatalities in the paediatric age group was associated with the use of antihistamines were identifi ed: diphenhydramine 33, brompheniramine 9 and chlorpheniramine 27. Of these 69 fatalities, 49 occurred in children aged <2 years and 28 in children aged 2-6 years. [35] Overdose and drug toxicity were commonly reported adverse events. The reasons given for the overdose occurring included use of multiple cough/cold products, medication errors, accidental exposures and intentional overdoses. There is consensus with expert opinion and evidence-based medicine to support that the risk outweighed the benefi t for the use of antihistamines and other common cold medications for treatment of URI in children. [36] In addition, FDA had issued a black box warning in 2006 against the use of promethazine in children less than 2 years old.",

Trials evaluating effi cacy of antihistamines in treating symptoms of URI in children available data from paediatric studies to conclude that cough and cold medicines are ineffective in children. In addition, the AAP noted that although these medicines are generally safe when used according to the product labelling, there are two situations that potentially put children at risk of serious adverse events or death when exposed to cough and cold medicines: the first is inappropriate dosing of cough and cold medicines. The AAP considers that the available of multiple multiingredient preparations that may contain the same active ingredients contributes to this risk. Secondly, complete lack of data to support current dosing regimens for paediatric patients. The lack of information available to physicians when the product labeling recommends consulting a physician for dosage advice. In addition there is possible risk with drug interaction between new generation antihistamine and macrolide to cause prolonged QTc-related arrhythmia. The AAP is also concerned that children under 2 appear to have a greater sensitivity to the potentially fatal effects of some of the ingredients in cough and cold medicines. The AAP considered that extrapolation of adult efficacy data for children is not justifi able as available paediatric data do not support the effi cacy of these medicines. In addition, there is signifi cant age-related developmental variability in both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in children such that it is clear that adults and children handle and respond to drugs differently. The AAP expressed considerable concern at the demonstrable lack of efficacy, evidence for considerable misuse, lack of rational basis for dosing, and apparent increased sensitivity to toxicity of these preparations in children under 6 years of age. The AAP recommended that unless clear, evidence-based paediatric dosing guidelines are available for all ages, these products should not be available for over-the-counter use in these age groups.",

The AAFP noted that serious complications are rare when the medications are used correctly, and supported the advice issued by the FDA to parents and caregivers in the Public Health Advisory. Current advice from the National Health Service (NHS) of United Kingdom on treating colds and coughs in children includes giving fl uids and treating fever and pain with paracetamol or ibuprofen, and the use of saline drops to loosen dried nasal secretions or help a stuffy nose in young children and babies. Although steam inhalation is not suitable for children because of the risk of scalding, a child may benefit from sitting in a hot, steamy bathroom. Simple cough mixtures containing a demulcent, for example glycerin, and syrup can have a soothing effect by coating the throat and relieving the irritation which causes the cough; a child over the age of one may also be helped by a warm drink of lemon and honey. [38] In the study, it was demonstrated that younger doctors tends to prescribe less antihistamines for children with URI. We hypothesized that this may be attributable to the emphasis of the risks-benefit ratio of antihistamines in pediatric URI in the undergraduate curriculum in medical schools. This contrasted to the need of change in practice and prescription behaviour for older doctors where they had already developed habits of prescription. This may provide insights on the way on further educational strategies to tackle the problem of overuse of antihistamines.",

Since the effect may be additive or synergistic, this may result in dosing error or overdose, increasing the risk of complications or unexpected death, and cases of unexpected mortality of children with URI were reported to be associated with antihistamine and other cold medication use in Hong Kong. Our study provided a recent review of the prevalence data about antihistamine prescription for URI in children in a local emergency department setting. While for very young infants, the emergency physicians are quite cautious to prescribe antihistamines, but for the toddlers and older children prescription of multiple antihistamines is quite common. More focus should be put on the publication of the concept of higher potential risks of antihistamine use in children aged less than 6. Moreover, doctors who graduated longer from medical schools have higher rate of multiple antihistamine prescription. With further understanding of the factors affecting prescription practice, targeted interventions and educational program could be designed for both primary care physicians, emergency physicians and the public, to reduce the unnecessary prescription of antihistamine and avoid potential risks. A local taskforce for reviewing the current evidence, provide advisory and recommendation, setting up plans for public education, World J Emerg Med, Vol 8, No 1, 2017 undergraduate curriculum and postgraduate education of frontline doctors is necessary.",
