            "text": "The phylogenetic and taxonomic relationships among the Old World leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideridae) and the closely related horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae) remain unresolved. In this study, we generated a novel approximately 10-kb molecular data set of 19 nuclear exon and intron gene fragments for 40 bat species to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships within the families Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae. We estimated divergence times and explored potential reasons for any incongruent phylogenetic signal. We demonstrated the effects of outlier taxa and genes on phylogenetic reconstructions and compared the relative performance of intron and exon data to resolve phylogenetic relationships. Phylogenetic analyses produced a well-resolved phylogeny, supporting the familial status of Hipposideridae and demonstrated the paraphyly of the largest genus, Hipposideros. A fossil-calibrated timetree and biogeographical analyses estimated that Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae diverged in Africa during the Eocene approximately 42 Ma. The phylogram, the timetree, and a unique retrotransposon insertion supported the elevation of the subtribe Rhinonycterina to family level and which is diagnosed herein. Comparative analysis of diversification rates showed that the speciose genera Rhinolophus and Hipposideros underwent diversification during the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum. The intron versus exon analyses demonstrated the improved nodal support provided by introns for our optimal tree, an important finding for large-scale phylogenomic studies, which typically rely on exon data alone. With the recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome, caused by a novel coronavirus, the study of these species is urgent as they are considered the natural reservoir for emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses. It has been shown that host phylogeny is the primary factor that determines a virus's persistence, replicative ability, and can act as a predictor of new emerging disease. Therefore, this newly resolved phylogeny can be used to direct future assessments of viral diversity and to elucidate the origin and development of SARS-like coronaviruses in mammals.",

They consist of nine extant genera (see table 1 for classification) and at least 82 species (Simmons 2005) . The Rhinolophidae, commonly known as horseshoe bats, comprise 77 species encompassed in a single genus, Rhinolophus (Simmons 2005) . Rhinolophidae are found in diverse habitats throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the Old World (Nowak and Paradiso 1999) . Hipposideridae and their sister taxon, the Rhinolophidae, are of exceptional scientific interest, having arguably the most sophisticated echolocation system (Jones and Teeling 2006) and are considered as the reservoir host species for the emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) -like coronaviruses Drexler et al. 2010; Ar Gouilh et al. 2011; Anthony et al. 2013 ).",

The familial status of the Hipposideridae, the monophyly of its most speciose genus Hipposideros, and the biogeographical origin of the putative family and its closest relative, the Rhinolophidae (Simmons 2005) , represent several areas of outstanding phylogenetic controversy. The distinctiveness of hipposiderid and rhinolophid bats was first recognized with the establishment of the subtribe Rhinonycterina (Gray 1866) , later elevated to subfamily by McKenna and Bell (1997) , and the subfamily Hipposiderinae (Flower and Lydekker 1891) . Classification of the Hipposideridae at the family level still remains unresolved with many authors preferring a subfamilial status within Rhinolophidae (Koopman 1993 (Koopman , 1994 McKenna and Bell 1997; Simmons 1998; Simmons and Geisler 1998; Teeling et al. 2002) , whereas others support a full familial classification (Pierson 1986; Bogdanowicz and Owen 1998; Hand and Kirsch 1998; Simmons 2005; Murray et al. 2012 1.

However, the monophyly of this genus is questioned. Morphological studies, which include up to eight of the nine Hipposideridae genera, have suggested that Hipposideros is paraphyletic (Sig e 1968; Legendre 1982; Bogdanowicz and Owen 1998) . However, a recent molecular phylogenetic study, which included four of the nine Hipposideridae genera, based on a single mitochondrial and nuclear genes supported the monophyly of the genus (Murray et al. 2012) (fig. 1) . Rhinolophus is the sole genus of the family Rhinolophidae and is composed of 77 recognized species falling into 12 species groups (Simmons 2005) . The clade that is most basal within extant Rhinolophidae is still controversial. Previous phylogenetic reconstructions of the Rhinolophidae are characterized by poor resolution at deeper nodes suggesting a rapid radiation in this family (Guillen-Servent et al. 2003 ). Based on a Cyt b tree, Guillen-Servent et al. (2003) recovered a basal clade containing the Rhinolophus trifoliatus and the R. hipposideros species groups. However, based on a combined data set of Cyt b and nuclear introns, Stoffberg et al. (2010) reported a single species, R. pearsoni, as the basal lineage with all other species (including R. hipposideros) forming two geographic clades, which are predominantly Oriental or Afrotropical. Nevertheless, Stoffberg et al. (2010) did not include members of the R. trifoliatus clade.",

Previous estimates of the time of divergence of these two groups indicate that they diverged about 39-45 Ma (Eick et al. 2005; Teeling et al. 2005; Miller-Butterworth et al. 2007) , which is comparable to divergence time estimates obtained for other bat families (Teeling 2009 ). Their unstable family-level classification has also led to uncertainty concerning the biogeographical origin of these two groups. The early suggestions regarding the origin of the Hipposideridae, based on morphological data, favored either an African or an Asian origin (Koopman 1970; Sig e 1991) . Neontological data, which supported family status for both groups, suggested that an Asian origin was most likely (Bogdanowicz and Owen 1998) . Koopman (1970) and Teeling et al. (2005) who regarded the Hipposideridae as a subfamily of the Rhinolophidae suggest an Asian origin for Rhinolophidae and by extension for the Hipposideridae. A reevaluation of divergence time estimates using a resolved phylogeny for these groups based on broad taxonomic sampling is required to elucidate the familial or nonfamilial status of the Hipposideridae and will also enable better biogeographic inferences.",

Molecular data, based on Cyt b, have placed the Rhinolophidae center of origin in Europe and suggest that from there, they expanded their geographical range into Asia and Africa (Guillen-Servent et al. 2003) . The exon and 3'-UTR-derived tree of Teeling et al. (2005) and the nuclear intron and Cyt b-derived tree of Stoffberg et al. (2010) supported an Asian origin, which conflicts with the African origin proposed by Eick et al. (2005) based on nuclear introns. To provide clarity in interpreting the biogeographic origin of the Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae, it is essential to test these hypotheses using a resolved taxonomy at the family level and building phylogenies using diverse data types.",

Among bats, the Rhinolophidae are of particular interest because R. sinicus, R. pusillus, R. macrotis, and R. ferrumequinum were suspected to be directly implicated in the outbreak of SARS in China (Lau et al. 2005; Li et al. 2005; Anthony et al. 2013) , and since then, a wider diversity of coronaviruses has been described from the Rhinolophidae Ren et al. 2006; Woo et al. 2006; Cui et al. 2007; Drexler et al. 2010; Rihtaric et al. 2010; Yuan et al. 2010) .

It has been demonstrated that host phylogeny is the primary factor that determines virus persistence and replicative ability in new hosts and perhaps most importantly that knowledge of host phylogeny can predict the source of new emerging diseases (Longdon et al. 2011) . Extrapolating from these phylogenetic associations represents a novel way in which coronavirus diversity can be more efficiently surveyed and assessed. Systematic surveillance for emerging coronaviruses should be orientated based on resolved phylogenies highlighting additional potential reservoir species. The successful detection of novel coronaviruses based on the limited studies conducted on Hipposideridae bats indicate that this family contains candidates in which to search for undescribed coronaviruses (Pfefferle et al. 2009; Quan et al. 2010; Ar Gouilh et al. 2011 ). However, one complicating factor is that the phylogenetic history and the taxonomy of the Hipposideridae remain unresolved. Therefore, deciphering these phylogenetic issues, as proposed, will be instrumental for detecting novel coronaviruses and for \"systematically\" guiding the surveillance of reservoir hosts to predict the emergence of novel pathogens.",

The phylogeny of Eick et al. (2005) focused on interfamilial relationships among bats and was constructed using slower evolving nuclear introns. Herein, we generated a data set comprising differentially evolving nuclear exons and introns to ascertain the familial status of the Hipposideridae and to elucidate the intergeneric phylogenetic relationships of the speciose and presumed rapidly diversifying genera Rhinolophus and Hipposideros. We hypothesize that slower evolving exons should provide resolution of deeper nodes, following their successful use in resolving phylogenies focusing on deep time scales at interordinal level in mammals ) and interfamilial levels in bats (Teeling et al. 2002 (Teeling et al. , 2003 (Teeling et al. , 2005 Miller-Butterworth et al. 2007; Lack et al. 2010) and that faster evolving introns should provide resolution of more recent nodes in a tree, following their widespread use in resolving intergeneric and species level relationships (Lim et al. 2008; Stoffberg et al. 2010; Puechmaille et al. 2011; Salicini et al. 2011) . In this study, we test the validity of these assumptions and the resolving power of exons and introns.",

A comparative diversification analysis focusing on Rhinolophus and Hipposideros was used to elucidate if the diversification patterns of these speciose lineages are similar through time. In particular, we explore potential impediments to phylogenetic resolution in our data by examining the effects of removing outlying data and compare the resolving abilities of exons and introns. Our phylogeny also addresses the following outstanding phylogenetic questions: 1) Do hipposiderid bats represent an independent family or a subfamily of the Rhinolophidae? 2) Is Hipposideros a monophyletic genus? 3) When did hipposiderid and rhinolophid bats diverge and where did they originate? 4) Which species or clade is the most basal lineage of the Rhinolophidae? Finally, we explore the use of our phylogeny for future systematic surveying for novel emergent coronaviruses and for the on-going conservation of these species.",

            "text": "Our results show that removal of outlying data had no effect on the overall tree topology and had a very minimal effect on posterior probabilities with a minor average posterior change of \u00c0 0.00167. Minor decreases (maximum decrease 0.03) in PP occurred at three nodes. It would be expected that phylogenetic trees that contain both old and young divergences would be best resolved by a combination of exon and intron data. In theory, exon data, which are slower evolving, should be best suited to resolve deep nodes in a tree and faster evolving intron data should better resolve young nodes. In contrast to these expectations, our analyses show there is no significant difference in the relationship between node height and posteriors for intron data ( fig. 6 ), yet exons showed poorer support for most of the oldest nodes in our phylogeny. When omitting incongruent nodes, introns systematically outperform exons in terms of nodal support. This cannot be explained by differences in fragment length as our comparisons were carried out on data sets of similar length with both jack-knifed sites and gene fragments. Rather, in line with previous studies (Chojnowski et al. 2008) , we argue that for an equal fragment size and the time frame investigated (~60 Ma), introns carry more phylogenetic signal than exons and are less prone to gene tree conflicts (Romiguier et al. 2013 ). Because of their faster substitution rate, introns evolve more quickly than exons and, hence, can provide more phylogenetic information. However, because they evolve faster, introns should also saturate faster but in a time frame of approximately 60 Ma, as investigated by Chojnowski et al. (2008) , saturation of the phylogenetic signal was not an issue for introns. This may stem from the alignment process, whereby highly variable and divergent intronic sites are removed from analyses given the difficulty in ascertaining homology for these positions. Throughout plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates, it has been shown that introns tend to have a lower GC content than exons (Amit et al. 2012) . This conserved characteristic of genome evolution has important consequences for accurate phylogenetic reconstructions as it has been shown that regions of the genome, which are GC rich have a higher amount of gene tree conflict and have greater difficulties in reconstructing well-supported consensus nodes in the placental mammal tree (Romiguier et al. 2013) . This is particularly important in the context of future phylogenomic studies as to date phylogenomic tree reconstructions have typically used only coding regions (Parker et al. 2013; Seim et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2013) . A recent study, particularly focused on echolocating mammals, revealed that many coding gene sequences show signs of convergent evolution and, hence, provide phylogenetic signals that are incongruent with the true species tree (Parker et al. 2013) . Although this remains to be tested, we predict that introns should be less prone to convergent evolution and should therefore provide better data to resolve species trees, especially when aligned optimally. The incongruence in tree topology observed between analysis of intron and exon data in our study highlights the importance of using a combination of markers in phylogenetic studies.",

The genus Aselliscus contains two species, and its placement in the Hipposideridae phylogeny has been controversial. Pierson (1986) concluded that Aselliscus was not a member of Hipposideridae and was more closely aligned with the Rhinolophidae, based on immunological transferrin distance data. Morphological data place this genus among other Hipposideros spp. (Bogdanowicz and Owen 1998; Hand and Kirsch 1998) . These morphological results are in agreement with molecular data, which found strong support for a sister taxa relationship between Aselliscus and Coelops The BEAST analysis of three nuclear introns indicated that Anthops falls within the monophyletic group of Hipposideros spp. (fig. 3) . The previous study involving this genus showed that it formed a sister taxa relationship with H. caffer to which H. commersoni sensu lato was basal (Eick et al. 2005) . As our study included more species of true Hipposideros, it was hoped that the position of Anthops within this group could be resolved as it has implications for the taxonomic classification of the genus. Our data show that Anthops forms a poorly supported group with H. jonesi, H. armiger, and H. larvatus. The strong support for the monophyly of this clade indicates that Anthops most likely represents an incorrectly classified member of the genus Hipposideros. However, as this is based on a small data set and only received poor support, this result is not yet conclusive. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that Anthops is a distinct genus basal to Hipposideros.",

(2003) recovered a sister taxa relationship between R. trifoliatus and R. hipposideros containing clades as the basal clade based on an analysis of Cyt b. Stoffberg et al. (2010) proposed a basal position for R. pearsoni based on Cyt b and intron data, though they did not include R. trifoliatus in their data set. Phylogenetic analysis of our data provided two further alternative topologies-a basal division between Asian and African/European clades and an alternative in which R. hipposideros is basal (table 2). Statistical tests rejected the hypothesis in which R. pearsoni is basal; however, only the AU and KH tests rejected the hypothesis in which a clade containing R. trifoliatus and R. luctus was basal, and the SH test was unable to reject this hypothesis most likely due to the conservative nature of this test (Strimmer and Rambaut 2002) (table 2) . The Stoffberg et al. (2010) phylogeny showed that, with the exception of the basal taxa R. pearsoni, two distinct clades are present in this family, one of African and one of Asian origin. To a certain extent, this biogeographic dichotomy is supported by our phylogeny. The Asian species grouped together with strong support to the exclusion of the European/African taxa; however, statistical tests were unable to differentiate between this hypothesis and an alternative in which R. hipposideros is basal. As a result, the structure within this group remains uncertain likely owing to the rapid diversification of the Rhinolophidae (Guillen-Servent et al. 2003) combined with a long branch leading to them. In future studies, increased taxonomic sampling and more markers will be necessary to resolve relationships within the Rhinolophidae.",

            "text": "How Long Ago Did Hipposideridae, Rhinonycteridae, and Rhinolophidae Diverge, and Where Did They Originate? The divergence times estimated by our molecular dating analysis were in-line with estimates previously established for the same groups (Eick et al. 2005; Teeling et al. 2005; Miller-Butterworth et al. 2007; Teeling 2009; Stoffberg et al. 2010; Anthony et al. 2013) . The Rhinolophidae are estimated to have diverged from the ancestor of the Rhinonycteridae and Hipposideridae approximately 42 Ma during the Eocene ( fig. 4 ). Rhinonycteridae and Hipposideridae diverged 39 Ma. The Lagrange biogeographic analysis indicated that the ancestors of these three families are of African origin ( fig. 4 ). An African origin for the Hipposideridae is in contrast to the Asian origin proposed by Teeling et al. (2005) and Bogdanowicz and Owen (1998) and the Australian origin proposed by Hand and Kirsch (1998) . No previous biogeographic hypothesis exists as to the origin of the component taxa of what is recognized herein as the Rhinonycteridae, and our analysis show that these bats are of African origin. The distribution of the extant members of the Rhinonycteridae is unusual in that Rhinonicteris is endemic to Australia, whereas all other members of the family are distributed in and around Africa, including Madagascar. This unusual distribution is shared by Allodapine bees that exhibit a similar Africa/ Australia split and are thought to have dispersed across the Indian Ocean by island hopping along the aerial formations of the Kergulen Plateau (Schwarz et al. 2006 ). However, a terrestrial continental dispersal route is better supported for Rhinonycteridae by the fossil record. The fossil taxon Brachipposideros nooraleebus, dating from the middle Miocene, is thought to be sister taxa to Rhinonicteris (Sig e 1968; Legendre 1982; Sig e et al. 1982; Hand and Kirsch 1998) , based on this, Brachipposideros is thought to have dispersed into Australia 15-20 Ma, a time which correlates well with our estimated divergence time for Rhinonicteris (Sig e et al. 1982). Brachipposideros has been found in Western Europe, Asia, North Africa, and Australia (Hand and Archer 2005) , which suggests a route from Africa into Europe then Asia before arriving in Australia.",

This indicated that these genera underwent a largely concurrent, rapid diversification during the Miocene, coinciding with the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, which was a warm and humid period in Earth's history, which peaked roughly 15-18 Ma . This period may have represented optimal conditions for the evolution and rapid diversification of these lineages in response to more favorable climatic conditions. The analyses showed that the rate of diversification of Rhinolophus and Hipposideros is very similar for both molecular markers ( fig. 5) .

            "text": "It is important to recognize the limitations of the methods used herein for divergence time estimation and biogeographic analysis. Caution must be taken when interpreting results provided by divergence time estimates given that errors can be introduced through the use of fossil calibrations as fossils based on limited characters can be incorrectly classified (Parham et al. 2012) , and stratigraphic layers can be assigned to incorrect geological times. This is particularly applicable to bats which have a poor and limited fossil record (Teeling et al. 2005; Eiting and Gunnell 2009) . Although the oldest fossil attributable to a lineage can provide a minimum age in a soft bound analysis, choosing a maximum bound is more difficult, here we use the stratigraphic bounding method of Meredith et al. (2011) to standardize the way in which maximum boundaries are chosen across the tree. Area coding is one of the key manners contributing to error in biogeographic reconstruction. Springer et al. (2011) showed that including information regarding the provenance of the oldest fossil 325 Overcoming Impediments to Resolution . doi:10.1093/molbev/msu329 MBE attributable to a clade produced very different results than only coding for the extant geographical distribution of a species. Including fossil taxa introduces error in the form of taphonomy and sampling bias. In particular, with regard to the fossil record of the Hipposideridae, the inclusion of fossil data to biogeographic analysis would introduce a European/ Australian bias based on the majority of species ascribed to this group to date (McKenna and Bell 1997; Hand and Kirsch 1998) . To overcome the limitations inherent in the bat fossil record, we use only the distribution of extant taxa in our analysis. Furthermore, taxonomic sampling remains a problem inherent in biogeographic analyses. Our phylogeny comprises representatives from all Hipposideridae, Rhinolophidae, and Rhinonycteridae genera. Our taxonomic sampling of Rhinolophidae does not include any Sub-Saharan African representatives, and so this may hinder a definitive biogeographic analysis of this family. However, a recent study of Emballonura bats has shown that the basal clade of a group can drastically impact its biogeographical reconstruction (Ruedi et al. 2012) . Although the basal clade of the Rhinolophidae remains unresolved, our reconstruction is the first to include all previously recovered basal candidates for this group as a strategy to minimize the impacts of partial taxonomic sampling of this group.",

The recent emergence of the novel MERS-CoV (Bermingham et al. 2013 ) has highlighted the importance of detecting and monitoring animal reservoirs of potentially pathological novel coronaviruses. The intermediate phylogenetic position of a SARS-like CoV between Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae derived from Rhinonicteris (Ar ) is supported by the resolved phylogeny for these bats as its phylogenetic position reflects the underlying divergence of these three bat families. Although they have been underrepresented in previous studies-see table 2 in Ar Gouilh et al. (2011)-our phylogenetic results suggest that other members of the Rhinonycteridae may represent excellent survey candidates to expand knowledge of the diversity of coronaviruses, especially those related to the Betacoronavirus-b group, which includes the SARS-CoV. Given the similarity of diversification rates between Rhinolophus and Hipposideros, studies focused on detecting novel coronaviruses in Hipposideros could potentially mirror the diversity of coronaviruses detected so far in Rhinolophus. A comprehensive understanding of the diversity of coronaviruses is important for human health in that as the genetic diversity of zoonotic viruses increases so too does the possibilities of variants crossing species boundaries .",

We show that removal of outlying data had no effect on tree topology and only a minimal effect on posterior probabilities. Furthermore, our analyses show that intron data provides better nodal support for our tree than exon data sets of similar size. Phylogenetic analyses resulted in a well-resolved phylogeny, which settles, for the first time, the phylogenetic controversies surrounding the Hipposideridae. A combination of phylogenetic analyses and divergence time estimates support the elevation of Hipposideridae and Rhinonycteridae to family level. Biogeographic analysis revealed that the Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, and Rhinonycteridae originated in Africa. The largest genus of the Hipposideridae, Hipposideros, is paraphyletic, and our study shows that Anthops ornatus may represent a species of Hipposideros. Our resolved phylogeny provides the foundation essential for \"systematic surveillance\" of emerging bat-based novel coronaviruses. Although they have been underrepresented in previous studies, our phylogenetic results suggest members of the Rhinonycteridae may represent excellent candidates in which to survey to expand our knowledge of the diversity of coronaviruses, especially those related to the Betacoronavirusb group, which includes the SARS-CoV. In this way, our phylogeny provides guidance to better predict and manage these human-lethal zoonotic diseases. These analyses also highlight these three bat families as separate Evolutionary Significant Units, with their own morphological peculiarities, long phylogenetic history, and patterns of dispersal, warranting differential conservation management strategies in the future.",

To evaluate the effect of removing outliers, we analyzed our data with and without outliers resulting in a total of six data sets for further phylogenetic analysis: 1) exons, 2) introns, 3) exons+introns, 4) exons-outliers removed, 5) introns-outliers removed, and 6) exons+introns-outliers removed. The steps taken to optimize the alignment of each data set were then evaluated using the GUIDANCE web server (Penn et al. 2010) , which reported that each position of our alignments were confidently aligned with regard to tree uncertainty. A comparison of the observed change in posteriors obtained from BEAST runs for exon+intron and exon+intron-outliers removed data sets was used to evaluate the effect of removing outliers.",

The RAxML analysis was carried out via the RAxMLgui v.0.95 (Silvestro and Michalak 2012) using the thorough bootstrap method with 500 replicates. The analysis used a partitioned model in which each gene was allowed its own model of sequence evolution. The analysis carried out in BEAST was as described above for single gene trees. BEAST employs a single Markov chain in its analysis, whereas MrBayes uses two independent chains. To highlight any differences or avoid shortcomings in either program arising from these different tree-searching methods, we used both programs as representatives of Bayesian Analysis. The MrBayes analysis was carried out under default settings, and the resulting run was analyzed as above for single-gene trees generated using BEAST. Bayesian analysis was also carried out in PhyloBayes to implement the CAT model of site rate heterogeneity, which is not yet implemented in BEAST or MrBayes. The mixture model options in PhyloBayes for nucleotide data are restricted to variants of either a general time reversible (GTR) or Poisson process of sequence evolution. For this analysis, the more complicated GTR was chosen in combination with the CAT model and a Dirichlet process to describe rate variation across sites. Two simultaneous MCMC chains were run, sampling and checking for convergence every 100 generations. This was done by automatically discarding 20% of the trees from each independent run and comparing, every 100 generations, the resulting 50% majority rule consensus trees until the observed maximum difference in split frequencies between the two chains converged on a value of less than 0.1. To assess further the convergence of the run, the analysis was repeated three times, resulting in the same topology.",

To explore if the rate of diversification was marker specific, all available Cyt b and Cox1 sequences for Rhinolophus and Hipposideros species were downloaded from GenBank (April 30, 2013). Four data sets were prepared for the diversification analysis: 1) Rhinolophus-Cyt b; 2) Rhinolophus-Cox1; 3) Hipposideros-Cyt b, and 4) Hipposideros-Cox1. The four data sets were subsequently aligned using MAFFT v.7 alignment server (Katoh and Standley 2013) . Sequences with 100% identity were identified and removed using CD-HIT server (Huang et al. 2010) . Because of the high number of sequences of conspecifics, sequences with 97.5% sequence identity or above were removed from the data set in an attempt to keep only one sequence per species; 97.5% was used as the cutoff as low intraspecific mtDNA sequence divergence between 1% and 2.5% have been generally reported for bats (Ditchfield 2000) . Data sets were then visually inspected to remove misidentified sequences and trimmed leaving one outgroup species. jModeltest was used to identify the most appropriate model of sequence evolution for each data set using the AIC, which resulted in the selection of GTR+I+G variants for all data sets. Gene trees for each gene fragment were generated in BEAST using the same parameters as previously described. LTT plots were constructed for each data set and compared in R 2.5.2 (R Development Core Team 2012) using the APE package (Paradis et al. 2004) . A nonparametric K-S statistical test was implemented in R 2.5.2 to detect significant difference between the rates of diversification inferred from the LTT plots of the Rhinolophus and Hipposideros genera.",

This analysis was carried out using the results of BEAST runs from analysis of the \"exons -outliers removed\" and \"introns -outliers removed\" data sets. It was not possible to compare directly the two outliers removed data sets (exons vs. introns) as the exon alignment was approximately three times larger (~7,000 bp vs.~2,500 bp), hence it would be expected that the exons should have more resolving power simply because there are more data. To overcome this, positions from the concatenated exon alignment were jack-knifed to form ten random exon data sets of 2,532 bp using custom R scripts. For each of the ten random exon data sets, jmodeltest indicated GTR+I+G was the best model. Each data set was analyzed in BEAST as described previously. We tested whether node height was related to PP using a general linear model with a binomial function and logit link. Differences in posterior probabilities for the same node between exons (average over the ten subsets) and introns were then tested in R using an asymptotic Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney rank sum test (Hollander and Wolfe 1999) . To investigate whether the results were specific to the jack-knifed data sets, we repeated the analysis using gene fragments. To obtain size comparable data sets, ten random combinations of four exon gene fragments",
