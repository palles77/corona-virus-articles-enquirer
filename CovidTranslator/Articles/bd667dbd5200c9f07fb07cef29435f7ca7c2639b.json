Many serum samples collected from ferrets recognized both a.a. 1-179 and a.a. 180-374 of the N protein, but two serum samples did not a.a. 180-374 of the N protein. This different reactivity was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis using the serum from the ferret.Therefore, the a.a. 1-179 of the N protein was used as an ELISA antigen. Serological test was carried out using sera or plasma of ferrets in Japan. Surprisingly, 89% ferrets in Japan had been infected with FRcoV. These results indicated that our established ELISA using a.a. 1-179 of the N protein is useful for detection of antibody to FRcoV for diagnosis and seroepidemiology of FRcoV infection.

            "text": "Epizootic catarrhal enteritis (EcE), a new enteric disease of domestic ferrets (Mustelo putorius furo), was first described in the United States in the early 1990s [11] . A novel alphacoronavirus, ferret coronavirus (FRcoV), was detected as the causative agent of EcE in 2000 and designated as ferret enteric coronavirus (FREcV) [11, 12] . Ferrets with EcE show general clinical signs including lethargy, anorexia and vomiting, and characteristic signs with foul-smelling, green mucous-laden diarrhea [12] . FRcoV was also reported as the causative agent of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)-like disease in 2006, and the virus was designated as ferret systemic coronavirus (FRScV) [2] [3] [4] . Ferrets with FIP-like disease show characteristic clinical signs of large palpable intraabdominal masses like dry type of FIP [2] [3] [4] . FRcoVs were divided into two genotypes, I and II, based on differences in the spike (S) gene, and it was suggested that genotype I was associated with FIP-like disease and genotype II was with EcE [13] . However, we previously showed that there was no significant relationship between the genotypes of FRCoV and disease in Japan [9] . In addition, genotype I FRcoV was also detected from many asymptomatic ferrets in the Netherlands [6] . The relationship between genotypes of FRcoV and clinical symptoms remains unclear.",

More ferret serum samples recognized GST-N (1-179) than GST-N (180-374) (Fig. 2 ). In addition, identities of N (1-179) between Yamaguchi-1 and the other FRcoVs (96.6-98.3%) were higher than those of N (180-374) (90.7-93.8%) (data not shown). Therefore, we selected GST-N (1-179) as the ELISA antigen for our serosurvey. Surprisingly, we found that 89% (31/35) of domestic ferrets were seropositive to this antigen by ELISA (Table 1 ). There are reports of FRcoV gene detection in 56%-61% of ferrets in Japan and the Netherlands [6, 9] . These data indicate that FRcoV has already spread within the ferret population and that many ferrets may be persistently infected with FRcoV. However, there was no significant difference between seropositivity and symptoms, age or sex. Further studies are required to clarify the pathogenesis of FRcoV in ferrets. Plasma from ferret No.10 and serum from ferret No.22 showed different reactivities from those of other ferret samples in ELISA, reacting only with GST-N (1-179), but not with GST-N (180-374) (Fig. 2) . The different reactivity of ferret No. 22 serum was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis using GST-N (180-374) (Fig. 3c) . These results indicated that GST-N (1-179) is a better choice of antigen for ELISA than GST-N (180-374). ELISA using GST-N (1-179) will be useful for serological surveys for FRcoV. In future studies, this FRcoV infected with ferret No.22 should be analyzed closely.",
