In control infected cells, all epitopes were accessible (not shown). So epitope f only was recognized on E2 with complex carbohydrate side chains, as postulated previously [6] . But it was interesting to observe that the pattern of accessible epitopes after treatment with MdN was not identical for intracellular viral glycoproteins and for E2 of the virion. These results can be explained by a structural and antigenic change occurring during the virus budding process. It indicates that composition of attached carbohydrate side chains on E2 influence virus antigenicity and is important for antibody reactivities. Other authors also reported that, if HIVinfected cells were treated with MdN, the accessibility of virion proteins to mabs was altered as well as bio-activity and conformations [2] .",
