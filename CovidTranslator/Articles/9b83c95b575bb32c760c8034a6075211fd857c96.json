We studied an integrated inventory model consisting of a single vendor and multiple buyers with warehouse capacity sharing via transshipment. We proposed an optimal transshipment policy by developing nonlinear programming models and genetic algorithms as well as obtaining Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points. This inventory policy can significantly reduce the channel-wide cost and the performance is influenced by the consideration of fixed transshipment costs. Sensitivity analyses show that parameters have different impacts on the channel-wide cost and the performances of the algorithms.",

On one hand, extending warehouse capacity usually involves a long-run investment that is a strategic decision. Such investment would require a certain or predictable increment in demand for a long period. On the other hand, many supply chains have some certain peak time of demand in a short period due to short-term sales promotions or emergencies. Therefore, it would not be economical for those managers to invest for higher warehouse capacities which cannot be fully utilized in the long run. Moreover, it is usually not easy to rent warehouses for a short time, such as one month. There exist many studies on inventory system with tight warehouse capacity (refer to Wang et al., 2012; Fiestras-Janeiro et al., 2015) , and delayed replenishment is considered as a solution to the single buyer case (refer to Lee and Wang, 2008; Yi and Sarker, 2013) . For multi-buyer cases, we show that transshipment between warehouses of buyers could be an efficient approach to improving the supply chain performance. The following examples in China motivate our research.",

Because demands during those periods are much higher than those at other time, warehouse capacities at many retailers are not sufficient. However, it is not easy for them to expand their warehouse capacities. First, building new warehouses may fail to be beneficial because each peak time may last for two or three weeks. Second, warehouse owners prefer long-term contracts (longer than one year) that make leasing warehouse capacity for a short time usually unavailable in China. Although some retailers may sell multiple types of products, it is still difficult for them to smooth out the utilization of the warehouses by scheduling the arrival of products because the demands are much higher than the warehouse capacities. In this case, the companies replenish products to retailers simultaneously in every cycle, and transship products between them to fully utilize warehouse capacities during the demand peaks which can reduce the ordering and replenishment costs.",

The SARS lasted for about half a year when citizens generated high and specific demand for some Chinese traditional medicines. Because this demand was caused by emergency, supply chains could not extend warehouse capacities of retailers to satisfy the high demand. Therefore, transshipment between retailers was implemented to increase the utilization ratio of warehouse capacities of supply chains. In addition, the suppliers replenished retailers simultaneously in every cycle, to satisfy the constraints for long-distance transportation, including limited number of trucks and drivers.",

            "text": "In an integrated inventory system, the vendor can arbitrarily move the products from one buyer to another, which is known as transshipment between buyers. Transshipment can also be achieved under the vendor managed inventory (VMI) system, in which the vendor has the authority to conduct transshipment between buyers. The advantage of transshipment is twofold. First, under uncertain demands, transshipment between buyers can improve the customer service level, and it is popular in many industries, such as automobile and consumer goods (refer to Anupindi et al., 2001) . In this case, transshipments transpire between a buyer with excess inventory and another with excess demand. To the best of our knowledge, most of existing studies on transshipment are motivated by this consideration. Second, under the transshipment policy, the vendor may improve the utilization ratio of the buyers' warehouse capacities by keeping products that exceed one buyer's warehouse capacity at other buyers' warehouses for a time. In this way, the vendor can move those products to that buyer at appropriate time points and benefit from this type of warehouse capacity sharing strategy. The above two examples reveal that this strategy has been implemented in the real world to improve the supply chain performance under some short-term selling seasons.",

In addition, with respect to methodology, we develop an efficient algorithm to find the channel-wide optimal solution under any assignment of buyers for transshipment. For the algorithm, we propose an optimal transshipment policy on the basis of which we can obtain the channel-wide optimal order quantity and the transshipment quantities between buyers by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. This paper is organized as follows. We review the related literature in Section 2 and propose a TRAN model in Section 3. Section 4 describes an algorithm that can be used to obtain the optimal solution when the assignment of buyers for the transshipment is given. The GA that accounts for the fixed transshipment cost is proposed in Section 5. A numerical example is discussed in Section 6, and we provide concluding remarks in Section 7.",

            "text": "A large body of literature is devoted to integrated inventory models with a single vendor and multiple buyers. Woo et al. (2001) studied an integrated inventory model for a single vendor and multiple buyers based on ordering cost reduction. In that model, the vendor orders raw materials and produces identical products for one cycle. Ordering costs can be reduced along with expenditure cost, and all of the buyers use the same replenishment cycle length. Zhang et al. (2007) extended the above model by considering that buyers can have different cycle lengths. Zavanella and Zanoni (2009) studied a VMI model by considering that buyers may receive the orders in different shipments. Darwish and Odah (2010) studied a VMI model with a single vendor and multiple buyers. In their model, the vendor orders and obtains the products at the beginning of each cycle, which is divided into several identical sub-cycles. All of the buyers share the same sub-cycle, and in each subcycle, the buyers obtain the amount of product to satisfy their demand. In that paper, they also considered a penalty cost for stock that exceeds buyers' warehouse capacity. Hariga et al. (2014) extended the above VMI model by considering a variable replenishment cycle. Sadeghi et al. (2014) studied a bi-objective inventory model for a three-stage supply chain with multiple retailers. In that model, the vendor has one replenishment frequency for all of the retailers. Mateen et al. (2015) analyzed a single vendor and multi-buyer inventory model and each buyer has an upper limit stock. Moreover, replenishment exceeding the limit generates a penalty cost in that model.",

The vendor is geographically far away from the buyers who are relatively geographically close to each other.

The replenishment quantity of buyer i is equal to the demand during the sub-cycle (i.e., T i ), and T 1 = T 2 =, \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1 ,=T m . After receiving products from the supplier, the vendor sends the products to the buyers simultaneously with lead time L i for buyer i in each sub-cycle. We consider L i values to be exogenously specified parameters. Because we focus on the lateral transshipment under warehouse capacity constraints, we assume that each buyer has a certain product demand (consumption) rate which is a usual assumption in inventory literature (refer to Darwish and Odah, 2010; Hariga et al., 2014; Mateen et al., 2015) . The order-quantity, reorder-point (Q, r) continuous review ordering policies are used at the buyers, each of whom has an inventory capacity. Preventive transshipment between buyers under centralized control occurs when the inventory levels reach the reorder points. Because the buyers are located in one region, we assume that the lead times of transshipments are negligible.

These conditions mean that the new solution satisfies Constraints (9)-(15) and is feasible for P1. Because s ij + s jk -s ik > 0, the average cost of the supply chain per unit time under Dq 0 ij , Dq 0 ik , and Dq 0 jk is lower than the cost under Dq ij , Dq ik , and Dq jk .

Because Gap II is greater than Gap I, we can infer that this cost saving can be reduced if the fixed transshipment cost is not considered in the optimal solution algorithm. The influence of fixed transshipment cost is created by two circumstances. First, if we do not consider this fixed cost, then we may obtain a solution in which buyer i transships few products to buyer j while other buyers (e.g., buyer k) not in E also still transship products to buyer j. Although the unit transshipment cost, s ij , is lower than s kj , transshipping a small number of products cannot compensate for the fixed cost of involving three buyers in the transshipment. Second, there exist cases in which s ij is lower than s kj while f i is greater than f k . Under these conditions the transshipment cost may not be minimized if we decide the transshipment solution based on s ij and s kj without considering f i and f k . Therefore, we find a trade-off exists between the fixed cost and the transportation cost in the transshipment. Moreover, the gaps are larger for large problems because more buyers could be involved in transshipment, which increases Gaps I and II. Because many buyers characterize large problems, a wide solution space is created that affects the optimal GA solution, which increases Gap III.",

As Tables 7 and 8 show, we investigate into an instance as an example to discuss the reason for this difference. The GA can yield good transshipment solutions under a q 1 that represents a relatively low transshipment cost (including transportation and fixed costs). Therefore, the GA may lead to solutions with a larger optimal q 1 than Algorithm 2 (see Tables  7 and 8) . When h b is increasing, a smaller q 1 may be preferable when each buyer's order quantity in one sub-cycle is decreasing. In this case, the optimal n is an affine transformation of q 1 . Hence, the optimal n is increasing with h b . Although the channel-wide costs under the models and algorithms are all increasing with h b , Gap III is decreasing. In addition, the decreasing rates of Gap III when h b is increased from $12 to $16 are greater than the rates when h b is increased from $8 to $10. In the latter cases, the optimal q 1 values from Algorithm 2 and from the GA are both 90. When h b is increased from $8 to $10, the absolute values of AC nf \u00c0 AC f are the same. Gap III is decreased only because AC nf is increasing when h b is increased from $8 to $10. When h b is equal to $12, $14, and $16, the optimal q 1 obtained from Algorithm 2 is decreased to 75 while the optimal q 1 from the GA is still 90. In these cases, the increment of AC f is higher than the increment of AC nf when h b is increased. Therefore, the absolute values of AC nf \u00c0 AC f are decreasing. Considering that AC nf is increasing with h b , the decreasing rates of Gap III when h b is increased from $12 to $16 could be greater than the one when h b is increased from $8 to $10.",

From this study, we can see that the average channel-wide cost can be saved by using the TRAN model under which the transshipment allows the order to arrive at various times. As a consequence, some buyers can obtain more products than their warehouses can accommodate. In addition, the utilization ratio of the warehouse capacities of some buyers is increased. When warehouse capacity is shared among buyers, the channel-wide optimal replenishment solution can be achieved. The numerical experiment shows the advantage of the TRAN model. The advantage can be more significant when the number of buyers is increased.",

Sensitivity analyses show how this impact is influenced by other parameters. From the results, we can see that h v has a positive impact on the advantage of the TRAN model, while h b has a negative impact on it.

First, we assumed that product consumption rates of buyers are known, and we focused on how supply chains benefit from transshipment as result of increased warehouse capacity. Considering the advantage of transshipment in increasing customer service level when the consumption rates are uncertain can be a fruitful direction. Second, we considered absolute constraints on the warehouse capacities of buyers. This model can be extended by considering penalty costs for exceeding upper bounds of inventory levels under our tight capacity constraints, which would make our model more applicable in general. Third, we studied an integrated channel and focused solely on reducing the channel-wide cost. It would be interesting to study the performances of members in a decentralized channel under a warehouse-sharing policy.",
