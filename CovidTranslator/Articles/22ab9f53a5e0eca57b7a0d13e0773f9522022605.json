As sample's viral load decreases, however, gradual increase of the entire coverage bias was observed with their protocol. Although such phenomenon is normally expected in multiplexed PCR for low-copy templates, we observed that coverages for the two particular PCR amplicons, 18 and 76, which correspond to the genomic regions coding for the nsp3 in ORF1a and S protein, respectively, decays far more rapidly than other targets. In our experience so far, low to absolute-zero depth for those two amplicons tends to be most frequent bottle neck for completion of all targeted genomic regions from samples with middle to low viral load (Ct > 27).

It should be noted that this amount of cDNA template per PCR reaction was 4-fold less than that in our usual protocol because we were intended to save those clinical samples. The thermal program was identical to the original ARTIC protocol, and the numbers of CPR cycles were 30 for experiment in Fig 2 and 35 for experiment in Fig 4. The PCR products in pool_1 and pool_2 reactions for same clinical samples were combined and purified by 1x concentration of AmpureXP. The purified PCR product was subjected to illumina library prep using QIAseq FX library kit (Qiagen) in 1/4 scale and using 6 min fragmentation time. After the ligation of barcoded adaptor, libraries were heated to 65 \u00baC for 20 min to inactivate ligase, and then, all libraries were pooled in a 1.5 ml tube without balancing DNA concentrations. The pooled library was first purified by AmpureXP at x0.8 concentration, and then again at x1.2 concentration. The purified library was sequenced for 151 cycles at both paired-ends in Illumina iSeq100 along with other samples which were not involved in this study.",
