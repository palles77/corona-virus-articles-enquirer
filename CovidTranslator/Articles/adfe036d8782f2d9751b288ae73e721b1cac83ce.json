It is necessary to develop safe and effective adjuvants capable of inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses. We previously showed that activationassociated protein-1 (ASP-1) derived from Onchocerca volvulus has potent adjuvant activity. In this study, we have further evaluated the adjuvanticity of recombinant ASP-1 using a panel of recombinant proteins or synthetic peptide-based antigens, including ovalbumin (OVA), synthetic HIV peptide (HIV-p), recombinant HIV gp41 (rgp41) and HBV HBsAg, as well as three commercially available inactivated vaccines against haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), Influenza and Rabies. Our results indicate that ASP-1 induced significantly higher IgG1 (Th2-associated) and IgG2a (Th1-associated) responses than alum adjuvant against OVA antigen, HIV-p, and rgp41. Consistently, it induced similar level of IgG1 responses as alum but higher level of IgG2a and IFN-\u03b3-producing T cell responses than alum adjuvant against HBsAg. Further, ASP-1 improved both IgG1 and IgG2a responses to three commercial inactivated vaccines when used separately or in combination. In conclusion, the recombinant ASP-1, unlike alum adjuvant, is able to induce both Th1 and Th2-associated humoral responses and Th1 cellular responses, suggesting that it can be further developed as a promising adjuvant for subunit-based and inactivated vaccines.",

T-helper 1-type (Th1)-based immune responses are essential for controlling intracellular infections, while Th2 immune responses are useful for controlling extracellular infections [1] . Since adjuvants can help to induce effective and appropriate immune responses to various antigens, they have been used as important components in vaccines [2, 3] . Although vaccine adjuvants have been used for almost a century, alum is the only adjuvant currently licensed by the U.S. FDA for clinical use to increase immune responses to protein-based vaccines [4] . Unfortunately, alum is able to induce strong antibody (Th2) responses, but it is a poor stimulator of cellular (Th1) immune responses, which are important for protection against many pathogens. In addition, alum may cause serious severe local and systemic side effects such as granulomas, allergenicity, neurotoxicity, sterile abscesses, and myofascitis [2, 4] . Thus, the limitations of alum restrict its use as a vaccine adjuvant with recombinant antigens. Consequently, there is a critical need for safer and more effective adjuvants suitable for human use, particularly those able to stimulate cellular (Th1) immunity.",

Cell pellets containing insoluble proteins were solubilized with 8 M urea overnight at 4 \u00b0C, followed by purification of urea-soluble proteins by Ni-chromatography (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ). The eluted fractions from histidine columns were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot. In brief, the purified ASP-1 protein was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The blots were blocked overnight with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) at 4 \u00b0C , followed by incubation with mouse anti-His antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times and incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Zymed, San Francisco, CA) for 1 h at room temperature.

The protein OVA was initially used as a model antigen to evaluate the adjuvanticity of ASP-1. The OVA was used alone, or together with ASP-1 (25 \u03bcg/mouse) and alum, respectively, to vaccinate mice. The mouse sera were collected and tested for IgG2a (Th1-associated) and IgG1 (Th2-associated) responses. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, OVA alone induced neither IgG2a nor IgG1 responses without adjuvant, while in the presence of alum, OVA was able to elicit a weak IgG1 response, but no IgG2a response. In contrast, ASP-1 could dramatically augment both IgG1 and IgG2a responses to OVA, whereas ASP-1 alone did not induce detectable immune responses. This result indicates that ASP-1 possesses high adjuvant effect on induction of both Th1-associated IgG2a and Th2-associated IgG1 responses to OVA in the vaccinated animals. Analysis of the time points in inducing IgG isotypes demonstrated that IgG1 titers in the OVA + ASP-1 group exhibited similar trend as that of the IgG1 titers in the OVA + alum group, i.e., increasing rapidly up to 4 weeks post-vaccination, reaching a peak at 8 weeks post-prime vaccination, and maintaining at high level for at least 12 weeks post-prime vaccination. IgG2a response in the OVA + ASP-1 group also showed similar trend but with higher antibody titers, whereas the IgG2a titers in the OVA + alum group were almost undetectable at all time points (Fig.  1C ). The ratio of the IgG1/IgG2a against OVA antigen plus alum was significantly higher than that when ASP-1 was used as an adjuvant ( Table 1 ), suggesting that ASP-1 is able to potentiate both Th1-and Th2-associated antibody responses to protein antigens with a distinctive bias for the Th1-associated antibody response, consistent with our previous report [11] .",

We then tested whether ASP-1 had similar adjuvant potency for recombinant proteins derived from human pathogens. To accomplish this, mice were vaccinated with ASP-1 mixed with recombinant baculovirusexpressed HIV gp41 protein (rgp41), and the results were compared to those of the commercial alum adjuvant. Generally, the results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the combination of rgp41 + ASP-1 induced higher level of IgG1 and IgG2a than that induced by rgp41 + alum (P < 0.01). Specifically, the titer of Th2-associated IgG1 and Th1-associated IgG2a increased rapidly after the 1st boost vaccination of rgp41 + ASP-1. These titers represent a significant increase over those for rgp41 + alum in detected either IgG1 or IgG2a (P < 0.01, Fig. 3A ). It appeared that boost vaccination of rgp41 + ASP-1 could increase both IgG1 and IgG2a titers. Similarly, the titers of IgG1 and IgG2a in the rgp41 + ASP-1 group are significantly higher than those of IgG1 and IgG2a in the rgp41 + alum group after the 2nd boost vaccination (P < 0.01, Fig. 3B ). Unlike alum group, ASP-1 group maintained a low level of anti-rgp41 IgG1/IgG2a ratio, confirming that ASP-1 is able to potentiate both Th2-and Th1-associated IgG1 and IgG2a responses, respectively ( Table 1) . The above results indicate that ASP-1 represents a substantial improvement over alum as a stimulant of IgG isotype responses against the recombinant gp41 protein, in particular with its ability to induce the strong Th1-associated antibody response.",

IgG1 and IgG2a isotype responses were detected in mouse sera respectively vaccinated with the vaccines separately or in combination of three vaccines with reduced doses for each individual vaccine in the presence or absence of ASP-1. First, Fig. 6 shows that ASP-1 may significantly improve the induction of IgG1 and IgG2a of single inactivated vaccines. For example, vaccine A, with the stimulation of ASP-1, induced a significantly higher level of IgG1 antibody against vaccine A than vaccine A alone (P < 0.05; Fig. 6A ). Similarly, the induction of IgG1 against vaccine C antibody was also significantly higher in vaccine C + ASP-1 than in vaccine C without ASP-1 (P < 0.05; Fig. 6C ). In the case of IgG2a induction, significant differences were obtained between vaccine B + ASP-1 and vaccine B without ASP-1 (P < 0.05; Fig. 6B ) and between vaccine C + ASP-1 and vaccine C without ASP-1 (P < 0.05; Fig. 6C ). IgG2a responses induced by the A+B+C+ASP-1 were significantly higher than those induced by the A+B+C without ASP-1 (Fig. 6A) . Similar results were obtained when anti-B or -C antibody responses induced by A+B+C vaccines in the presence or absence of ASP-1 were tested ( Fig. 6B and C) . The results suggest that ASP-1 may be used as a potential adjuvant to improve immune responses of commercial vaccines when these vaccines are administrated separately or in combination. The results also suggest that ASP-1 may help to balance Th1/ Th2 immune responses when a combination of vaccines is used together with a reduction in dosage, which decreases the potential side effects otherwise produced by the induction of multiple vaccines, but without affecting vaccination efficacy.",

Higher safety profile and less toxicity at injection sites have resulted in pure recombinant or synthetic antigen-based vaccines becoming a current trend in vaccine development [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . However, subunit-based vaccines with adjuvants as stimulants are usually less immunogenic than traditional live or whole-killed organism-based vaccines. This major advantage is creating a high demand for more powerful adjuvants for use with subunit vaccines [2] . Although some vaccine adjuvants such as BOS 2000 have been reported to induce mixed antibody (Th2) and cellular (Th1) immune responses against pathogenic antigens [21] , many adjuvants studied to date are less effective or cause inflammatory responses. Alum is the only adjuvant approved for human use worldwide, but it is mainly associated with Th2 responses and has no or little capacity to stimulate cellular (Th1) immune responses [2, 21] . Therefore, it is urgent to develop adjuvants effective in inducing not only humoral immune responses, but also cellular immune responses.",

Our initial studies have indicated that vaccination of mice with recombinant Ov-ASP-1 may stimulate high titers of IgG1 (Th2) and IgG2a (Th1), significantly exceeding the efficacy of alum or MPL + TDM adjuvants [11, 12] . This indicates the striking potential of this protein as a novel adjuvant for human use. In this study, comprehensive research was carried out on the ASP-1 protein to further evaluate its adjuvanticity. As a starting point, the OVA antigen and a synthetic peptide from HIV, HIV-p, were used to test the adjuvanticity of the recombinant ASP-1. The OVA protein has been widely used as a model antigen for adjuvanticity detection since this protein has no ability to induce immune responses without an adjuvant [14, 15] . It turns out that ASP-1 was effective in eliciting antibody (Th2) and cellular (Th1) responses in mice immunized with unrelated OVA protein and HIV synthetic peptides, with ASP-1 adjuvanticity exceeding that of alum adjuvant, especially in the induction of the Th1-associated IgG2a isotype (Figs. 1 and 2 and Table 1 ).",

These two proteins were selected because they are important pathogenic antigens of two major infectious diseases, HIV and hepatitis B. The results from HIV rgp41 + ASP-1-vaccinated mice confirm the ability of ASP-1 to stimulate IgG1 and IgG2a responses against the recombinant HIV gp41 protein, which is more effective than commercial alum adjuvant (Fig. 3) . Even though alum has only a weak ability to induce cellular responses, it is often used as an adjuvant combined with the HBsAg surface antigen against HBV infection [23, 24] . Therefore, we used ASP-1 as a stimulus of HBsAg to test its adjuvanticity and compared it to that of alum. The ability of ASP-1 to induce Th2 responses against HBsAg was equivalent to that of alum; however, our results indicate that its ability to induce Th1 responses still outperforms alum, which was demonstrated by the production of a similar level of IgG1, but higher level of IgG2a and IFN-\u03b3-producing T cell responses (Figs. 4 and 5) . These results therefore confirm the advantages of ASP-1 over traditional alum adjuvant for the formulation of HBV vaccines.",

To accomplish this, vaccines were either used independently or combined at a dosage of 1/4 that of the single vaccine plus ASP-1. Importantly, both Th2-associated IgG1 and Th1associated IgG2a could be increased by the addition of ASP-1 in either single vaccine groups or in the combined groups (Fig. 6) . Equal or higher immune responses detected in three vaccine combinations suggest that ASP-1 may help vaccine combinations to induce the same effect as single vaccines but with less dosage, indicating that potentially induced side effects by combination of vaccines could be eliminated.

Unlike alum, this protein adjuvant has the ability to stimulate a mixed Th1/Th2 with a strong Th1-biasd immune response. Our results also indicate that ASP-1 has potential adjuvanticity in inducing immune responses of recombinant subunit-based vaccines, synthetic peptides, as well as in improving the immune efficacy of commercial inactivated vaccines, suggesting that its potency is promising for development into a practical adjuvant for human use. Evaluation of the adjuvanticity of ASP-1 to the synthetic HIV-p peptide. Groups of 5 mice were respectively vaccinated with HIV-p (20 \u03bcg/mouse), ASP-1 (25 \u03bcg/mouse) or HIV-p + ASP-1. Mouse sera were collected 1 week post-1st and -2nd boost and detected by ELISA for the IgG isotype. The same concentration of alum was used as the control of ASP-1. The induction IgG1 and IgG2a in the 1st (A) and 2nd (B) post-boost vaccination was compared, respectively in the HIV-p, HIV-p + alum, ASP-1 and HIV-p + ASP-1 vaccination groups. The data are presented as geometric mean titers + S.E. of five mouse sera from each group. *P < 0.05 compared to the HIV-p, HIV-p + alum or the ASP-1 group. Evaluation of ASP-1 to HBsAg epitope-specific Th1 responses by ELISPOT. Splenocytes from six vaccinated mice were stimulated with HBsAg-specific CD4 + T cell peptide HBs-p for 24 h. Culture medium without stimulus was applied as the negative control (NC). Frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells (Th1) are expressed as mean values of spot-forming cells (SFC) per 10 6 splenocytes in five independent experiments. *P < 0.05 compared to the HBsAg + alum or the ASP-1 group. Evaluation of ASP-1-stimulated IgG isotype responses to commercial vaccines. Groups of six mice were, respectively vaccinated with single commercial vaccines or three vaccine combinations in the presence or absence of ASP-1. Mouse sera were collected 1 week postboost vaccination, and induced IgG1 and IgG2a against respective vaccine antigens were detected by ELISA. (A) IgG1 and IgG2a induction against vaccine A. *P < 0.05 as compared A + ASP-1 to A, and A+B+C with or without ASP-1 for anti-A, respectively. (B) IgG1 and IgG2a induction against vaccine B. *P < 0.05 as compared B + ASP-1 to B, and A+B+C with or without ASP-1 for anti-B, respectively. (C) IgG1 and IgG2a induction against vaccine C. *P < 0.05 as compared C + ASP-1 to C, and A+B+C with or without ASP-1 for anti-C, respectively. The data are presented as geometric mean titers + S.E. of six mouse sera from each group. Vaccine A (HFRS vaccine), vaccine B (Influenza vaccine) and vaccine C (Rabies vaccine) are inactivated vaccines against three major infectious diseases, HFRS, Influenza and Rabies. ",
