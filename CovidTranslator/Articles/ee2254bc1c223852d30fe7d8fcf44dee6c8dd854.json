Furthermore, there is a possibility that some patients were included in more 288 than one report, although two authors independently reviewed all the included studies, carefully 289 focusing on the different Institutions reporting outcomes. Moreover, when focusing on the 290 outcomes of COVID-19 infection, and particularly perinatal outcomes, reported data are intuitively 291 limited to a very short-term follow-up period and thus infectious that occurred proximate to the 292 underestimate more longitudinal risks such as FGR. Additionally, it was not possible to extrapolate 294 data about the rate of both spontaneous and iatrogenic PTB and indications for CD, that was 295 performed in the majority of cases; furthermore, few outcomes, i.e. \"fetal distress\", were not clearly 296 defined, thus leading to some discrepancies in the results, like the rate of PTB < 34 weeks (15%) 297 and the rate of newborns admitted to NICU (9%), particularly in COVID-19 infection. Another 298 limitation of the present review was the lack of stratification of the analysis according to the 299 gestational age at CoV infection due to the very small number of included studies for each trimester 300 of pregnancy. We cannot assume that the rate of miscarriage and PTB should be attributed solely to 301 the virus / infection, since there are no comparable control groups of uninfected women from the 302 same time.
