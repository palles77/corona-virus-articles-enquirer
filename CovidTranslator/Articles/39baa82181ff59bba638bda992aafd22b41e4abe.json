Subsequent investigation showed that earlier MERS-CoV infection had occurred in Jordan in April 2012 among a cluster of patients with pneumonia (2,3). As of February 5, 2015, the World Health Organization had reported 971 laboratory-confirmed cases worldwide and at least 356 related deaths (4) . All known reported cases have been linked directly or indirectly to the Middle East region; most have been reported by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Typically, the initial symptoms for MERS patients seeking medical care are fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia. These symptoms often progress to severe lower respiratory tract infection, which may require mechanical ventilation and intensive care (5, 6) . Several asymptomatic or mild MERS cases have been reported (7), particularly in healthy young adults. Little is known about transmission routes, virus shedding, risk factors, and animal reservoirs, although bats and camels have been implicated in transmission and as reservoirs (8, 9) . Clusters of human-to-human transmission have been associated with household and health care settings (2, 3, 5) .",

As of March 12, 2015, a total of 47 states and the District of Columbia had MERS-CoV testing capability. The assay kit is intended for detection of MERS-CoV RNA in respiratory, serum, and stool samples. CDC also developed serologic tests for detecting MERS-CoV antibodies; these tests have been used by CDC since the summer of 2013. Because MERS-CoV is an emerging pathogen, CDC guidelines and guidance regarding PUI characteristics are periodically updated as new MERS-CoV information and risk factors are identified. CDC recommends evaluating and testing PUIs for MERS-CoV and for other common respiratory pathogens.",

Health care providers for persons suspected of having MERS were to contact their state or local health department for consultation and to arrange for MERS-CoV testing, if indicated. PUIs were reported to CDC through state and local health departments by using the single-page PUI short form, which contains no personal identifiers (11) . Since its implementation, the short form has been revised 3 times to reflect modifications to the PUI guidance. The short form collects information on basic demographic data, symptoms, disease severity, hospitalization, travel history, risk factors, and laboratory test results at the time of MERS-CoV testing. Follow-up data collection on missing information was not routinely performed. At least 370 (76%) PUIs met the guidance characteristics for PUI for MERS. The remaining 120 (24%) PUIs had incomplete clinical or travel data; the most common missing information was pneumonia data for persons with respiratory symptoms and a recent travel history. The short form was sent electronically to CDC by secure fax or email. Data collected on the short form was entered into a CDC database by using Microsoft Access (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used for data analysis.",

CDC also recommends testing for common respiratory pathogens (e.g., influenza virus), but identification of a respiratory pathogen should not preclude MERS-CoV testing (14) . The PUI guidance serves to help health care providers and state health departments identify patients for evaluation and testing for MERS-CoV infection; however, because we are still learning about the natural history of MERS-CoV, it is reasonable to consider testing for MERS-CoV even when some PUI characteristics are not present, especially in the presence of strong clinical or epidemiologic judgment for MERS-CoV. During the evaluation process for MERS-CoV infection, appropriate infection control measures should be instituted as soon as possible for hospitalized and nonhospitalized PUIs (15) .",

As testing increases, especially serologic testing, additional MERS cases, including mildly symptomatic cases and cases among younger persons are being identified.
