The expert panel reinforces the 'transnational and interdisciplinary' nature of global health research and practice as an endeavor 'to improve health and achieve greater equity for all people worldwide.' This report was judiciously timed given the growing recognition of global health, and is also acknowledged for incorporating themes that are particularly pertinent to the twenty-first century. New paradigms are introduced, denouncing the dichotomous distinction between rich and poor countries with the rapidly transitioning countries emerging as global powers, and affirming the need for models of respectful partnership and wider translation of science into practice. Cultivating sustainable partnerships and investing in the understanding and combat of diseases worldwide will become increasingly important for the US to maintain its global competitiveness, and may offer lessons in innovation, efficiency, and organization of institutions and human resources.",

When a new flu infects one human being, all are at risk. When one nation pursues a nuclear weapon, the risk of nuclear attack rises for all nations. When violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangered across an ocean. And when innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on our collective conscience. That is what it means to share this world in the 21st century. That is the responsibility we have to one another as human beings. This is a difficult responsibility to embrace.' (1) In line with this growing realization of contemporary global inter-dependence, the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) recent report entitled 'The U.S. Commitment to Global Health: Recommendations for the Public and Private Sectors' 1 is particularly timely (2) . This report was the product of an expert committee, chaired by Harold Varmus, Nobel Laureate and former director of the United States (US) National Institutes of Health (NIH), and is an updated collection of recommendations, building on several influential organizations and texts that embody this theme (3\u00c15). Global health engenders issues that transcend national boundaries, and requires global cooperation, multi-disciplinary, and interdisciplinary involvement toward achieving greater socioeconomic and health equity, for both domestic and international populations (6) .",

            "text": "Generate and share knowledge endemic to the global poor The report acknowledges the US' contribution to science, but appropriately criticizes the focus on investigating a narrow range of diseases that affect developed countries. Research funds tend to be disproportionately skewed toward high-profile diseases, while suboptimal distribution of proven technologies and interventions for under-nutrition, vaccine-preventable diseases, and non-communicable diseases (NCD) (7) receive little attention, thereby perpetuating the mortality and morbidity burdens due to these conditions. Furthermore, current contributions toward multi-lateral organizations (e.g. the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria) have not been optimized. In the case of TB, for example, antiquated diagnostic tools and therapeutic options dating back at least a half-century are still the mainstays used today, perpetuating the development of drug resistance. As such, the report emphasizes the significance of: appropriate application of innovation and technology toward identifying acceptable and accessible solutions; health systems research; novel proliferation incentives (e.g. advanced market commitments); and improved methods, greater connectivity, and wider access for disseminating knowledge to contexts where they are most urgently required, especially since good health outcomes result from applying global strategies through local forces (communities, families, and decentralized institutions).",

Also, as a matter of global responsibility, the US should invest in health worldwide as it has and continues to rely heavily on internationally trained health workers; in the year 2000, foreign-trained nurses and physicians accounted for 9.1 and 25% (a combined workforce totaling over 350,000 professionals) of US health personnel, respectively (8, 9) . Acknowledging the need for skilled, experienced, and knowledgeable health professionals to remain vested in low and middle-income countries (LMIC), the recommendations outline incentives (monetary, career-enhancing opportunities), and leveraging scientific and academic collaborations toward skills transfer, policy development, and improving institutional capacity. The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) recent Global Health Initiative (10, 11) provides a good example of advancing research and human resource development in LMICs through financing institutional partnerships for chronic diseases research. This scheme and the Fogarty International Scholars Program incorporate opportunities for US investigators and trainees to work in new and varied environments, and forges alliances with US universities. In the long term, imparting models that engender high-quality scientific investigation and selfsufficiency will augment coordinated research and health programs between countries, inform national policies, and also create opportunities for young analysts, researchers, and junior faculty to be able to remain incountry and complete the circle by teaching others. Local capability will breed sustainability and foster global collaboration.",

Although not included in the UN Millennium Development Goals, these diseases account for 60% of mortality worldwide, of which 80% occurs in LMICs, affecting young and vulnerable subpopulations, often with devastating societal and individual socioeconomic impacts (12) . Augmented investments in global health must be comprehensive, continuing to support initiatives aimed at highly prevalent infectious threats, but also providing funds for neglected diseases of poverty and health systems development. Novel transaction mechanisms and training methods can aid local dissemination of financing, procurement and distribution of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, and capacity development; ultimately, it is the local institutions (families, communities, and service organizations) that can best adapt global solutions to local contexts in order to deliver sustainable results. At the same time, concerted global cooperation among leaders of nations is required to address broader issues like global warming and its effects on health.",

In addition, the report advocates coordination amongst the huge variety of agencies involved in global health. Although the recommendation is justified and current efforts are fragmented, sometimes duplicated, and often unplanned and improvized, it must be acknowledged that coordinating this plethora of vested groups introduces immense complexity and traditional models of organizing and synchronizing efforts may not work. The recently formed Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases, a consortium of six of the world's most influential health agencies, is a promising new venture committed to coordinating the global health community's fight against NCDs, and will attempt to do so by engaging more collaborative priority-setting (13).",

Additionally, research to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of practical, low-cost interventions in real-life settings where suboptimal circumstances are common, satisfies many of the themes stipulated in the report and offers the potential of scalability and sustainability. Arguably, out of necessity, there is a high tolerance for risk in the types of innovative research undertaken in resource constrained settings of LMICs. For example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sponsored a study in rural India from which a cervical cancer screening test emerged as effective and acceptable, prompting the likelihood that this test will replace long-established pap smears (16, 17) . Furthermore, the manufacturers of the test have declared that market demand and Gates Foundation subsidies will lower the cost to approximately US$5 per test, making it a viable option for rich and poor countries alike.",

Transitioning demographic, nutritional, and lifestyle patterns that accompany these developments result in changing epidemiological patterns. Ageing, global warming, marketization, adoption of sedentary lifestyles and calorie-dense low-fiber diets, and changing modes of transport between and within countries, together result in increasingly common health challenges (obesity, diabetes, and escalating costs of health care) as well as rapid transmission of health threats and information across countries. The imperative for coordination and investment in health is paramount given the mounting burdens of chronic NCDs and looming issues of climate change. As such, the IOM report sets out progressive recommendations, but what of the adoption of these proposed schemes, and what metrics need to be considered to adequately evaluate these?",

Political esteem is currently intimately linked with domestic public sentiment leading to legitimate prioritization of their own citizens' concerns, domestic politics, and protectionism. Free market and trade liberalization ideologies have been 'modified' by wealthier nations to exploit large consumer markets overseas while regulating imports of competitive products from these countries; this will ensure that the equity gap between wealthier nations and LMICs will be maintained, no matter how noble the country's perspective. Amidst these issues, is it realistic for us to believe health concerns globally are ever going to climb high enough on the agenda of high-income countries unless consumer market size is threatened?",
