In the case of positive-stranded RNA viruses, the ability to translate and, thus, replicate their infecting genome is dependent upon hijacking host proteins. To identify proteins that participate in West Nile virus (WNV) replication, we tested the ability of siRNAs designed to knock-down the expression of a large subset of human genes to interfere with replication of WNV replicons. Here we report that multiple siRNAs for proteasome subunits interfered with WNV genome amplification. Specificity of the interference was shown by demonstrating that silencing proteasome subunits did not interfere with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicons. Drugs that blocked proteasome activity were potent inhibitors of WNV genome amplification even if cells were treated 12 h after infection, indicating that the proteasome is required at a post-entry stage(s) of the WNV infection cycle.",

These viruses are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. WNV first became a public health concern in the United States in 1999, when it was introduced into New York City. Since then, there have been more than 27,000 reported cases of disease associated with WNV infection with over 11,000 cases presenting with severe neurological pathologies, resulting in nearly 1200 deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008) . Unfortunately, as with many other flaviviruses, there are no approved antiviral therapies to control WNV disease and, as of yet, no approved vaccine for protection against WNV diseases.",

The genome encodes a mere 11 proteins, 3 nonstructural (C, prM/M and E) and seven nonstructural (NS1-NS5) (Brinton, 2002) , all of which has been demonstrated to play some role in replication of the viral genome (Lindenbach et al., 2007) . Due to the limited amount of genetic material it carries, WNV, like other viruses, is expected to be dependent upon many components of the macromolecular machinery of the host cell. As a consequence, it is expected that WNV proteins and the viral genome must interact with a multitude of host proteins to infect cells and efficiently reproduce itself. In fact, several such interacts at various stages of WNV infection have been identified.",

            "text": "One of the first virus-host interactions that can occur is the interaction between the virus particle and a receptor(s) on the host cell surface to promote viral entry. A recent report suggests that WNV entry may be mediated, in part, by \u03b1v\u03b2 3 integrin (Chu and Ng, 2004b) or DC-SIGN (Davis et al., 2006) resulting in internalization of the virus via a clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway (Chu and Ng, 2004a) . Further, infection of the virus can also be facilitated by binding to cellsurface heparan sulfate (Gilfoy and Mason, 2007; Lee and Lobigs, 2000) . Three different host proteins, translation elongation factor-1\u03b1, T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1) and TIA-1-related protein (TIAR) have been shown to interact with the 3\u2032-terminal stem loop of the WNV genome (Blackwell and Brinton, 1995; Blackwell and Brinton, 1997; Li et al., 2002) . The interaction between TIA-1 and TIAR and WNV is reported to interfere with WNV-induced stress granule formation and processing body assembly (Emara and Brinton, 2007) , which are sites of translational control and mRNA aggregation and degradation under times of stress. Additionally, the Src kinase c-Yes was demonstrated to be an important host protein involved in WNV particle release from infected cells, an activity that appears to manifest itself at the level of particle trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the extracellular space (Hirsch et al., 2005) . Virology 385 (2009) [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] The ubiquitin-proteasome system is a ubiquitous extralysosomal protein degradation system that clears unneeded proteins from both the cytosol and the nucleus. It plays a key role in a vast number of normal cellular processes including the removal of misfolded or abnormal proteins, the cellular stress response, the removal of unneeded proteins during cell differentiation, cell cycle regulation and the cellular immune response (Ciechanover, 1994; Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002) . Proteins targeted for degradation are tagged with ubiquitin by a covalent bond that is produced by three enzymatic entities: an activating enzyme, E1, a carrier enzyme, E2, and a ligase, E3, which ultimately binds ubiqutin onto the protein (Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002; Nandi et al., 2006) . Mono-or polyubiquinated proteins are then trafficked to the 26S proteasome, where they are degraded.",

            "text": "The eukaryotic 26S proteasome is a ubiquitous, highly conserved multi-protease complex consisting of a barrel-shaped, proteolytic core complex (the 20S proteasome) with a 19S regulatory complex, or cap, at one or both ends (Groll et al., 1997; Perkins et al., 1994; Tanaka et al., 1988; Voges et al., 1999) . The 20S proteasome is composed of two copies of seven alpha subunits (\u03b11-\u03b17) and seven beta subunits (\u03b21-\u03b27) arranged into 4 stacked rings. The two outer rings contain the alpha subunits, which are important for controlling entry and exit of proteins as well as binding to specific regulatory proteins. The two inner rings, on the other hand, are composed of the beta subunits, which represent the catalytic active sites of the proteasome (Nandi et al., 2006) . Up to three primary proteolytic activities have been attributed to the proteasome: trypsin-like activity (cleavage after hydrophobic amino acids), chymotryspin-like activity (cleavage after the basic amino acids) and caspase-like (cleavage after the acidic amino acids). In eukaryotic proteasomes, each of these protease activities is associated with a specific beta subunit, \u03b22, \u03b25 and \u03b21, respectively Kisselev et al., 2003; Nussbaum et al., 1998) . Interestingly, in mammals a specialized form of the proteasome has evolved in which the three catalytic beta subunits are replaced by different catalytic subunits, \u03b22i, \u03b25i and \u03b21i (Demartino and Gillette, 2007) . This proteasome, referred to as the immunoproteasome, replaces the constitutive proteasome following immune stimulation and is responsible for generating antigenic peptides that are displayed by the class I major histocompatability complex {MHC I (Baumeister et al., 1998; Goldberg et al., 2002; Rock et al., 1994) }.",

Members of multiple families of both RNA and DNA viruses have been shown to modulate the ubiquitinproteasome system to their advantage for a variety of reasons, including immune evasion, viral entry or release, transcriptional regulation and apoptosis inhibition (Banks et al., 2003; Gao and Luo, 2006; Shackelford and Pagano, 2005) . Many viruses, including human cytomegalovirus (Kikkert et al., 2001; Shamu et al., 2001) , Epstein Barr virus (Levitskaya et al., 1997) and several other herpes viruses (Boname and Stevenson, 2001; Coscoy et al., 2001) interfere with the processing of MHC class I peptides. The ubiquitin-proteasome system has been shown to facilitate entry or transport of incoming influenza virus (Khor et al., 2003) , minute virus (Ros et al., 2002; Ros and Kempf, 2004) and murine coronavirus (Yu and Lai, 2005) . The release of HIV viral progeny requires proteasome activity, presumably by allowing efficient processing of Gag protein by the viral protease, thereby facilitating virion budding from the plasma membrane (Patnaik et al., 2000; Schubert et al., 2000; Strack et al., 2000) . Additionally, proteasome inhibition markedly reduces coxsackievirus group B3 viral RNA and protein synthesis levels, resulting in a decrease in the release of progeny virus (Luo et al., 2003) .",

Additionally, using specific proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and PS1, we demonstrate that inhibition of the proteasome results in a reduction of WNV antigen levels, WNV protein accumulation and progeny virus yield. This inhibition is observed following treatment with these inhibitors both pre-and post-infection, indicating that WNV utilizes the proteasome at a post entry step of its replication cycle.",

VRPs are replicons (viral genomes lacking the sequences for the structural genes) packaged into particles with structural proteins that are provided in trans by packaging cells. WNV VRPs are particularly useful as they mimic WNV infection and genome amplification in nearly all aspects; however, because the packaged replicons do not encode the structural genes, VRP infections do not produce progeny virions. Thus, VRPs can be used to easily study infection and/or genome amplification independent of assembly and release. Additionally, because they are unable to spread beyond the initially infected cell, VRPs are safe to use under biosafety level 2 (BSL2) conditions.",

Consistent with the Fig. 2 studies, treatment of HeLa cells with PS1 resulted in a reduction in WNV protein expression at the lowest drug doses tested (Fig. 3A) . Additionally, treatment with MG132 resulted in a reduction in WNV protein expression compared to mock-or DMSO-treated cells, although, consistent with our FLuc and ELISA detection methods (see Fig. 2 ) the MG132-mediated effect on NS3 expression was less than that observed with PS1 treatment (Fig. 3B) . The NS3 antibody consistently recognized two bands. The lower band corresponds to the predicted molecular weight of NS3, approximately 70kd, while the top band may represent uncleaved NS2A-NS3 or NS3-NS4A. Levels of \u03b2-actin, which served as a loading control, were similar in all treatment groups with the exception of 20 \u03bcM MG132, where a (Panel A) Non-targeting, negative control (NEG) siRNA, WNV-specific, FLuc-specific, PSMA1-specific or PSMA2-specific siRNAs were transfected into Huh7 cells, incubated for 72 h and then infected with VEEV FLuc VRP or WNV hFLuc VRP for an additional 16 or 24 h, respectively. Cell monolayers were then assayed for FLuc activity (WNV or VEEV replication levels) and RLuc activity (cell number). Values are shown as % FLuc normalized to % RLuc compared to mock-transfected cells. Error bars represent standard deviations from the mean between three independent experiments and an asterisk represents statistic significance compared to NEG siRNA transfection (p b 0.05). (Panel B) Monolayers of siRNA-transfected Huh7 cells were harvested and assayed, by Western blot, for levels of PSMA1, PSMA2, WNV NS3 and \u03b2-actin (loading control). reduction in \u03b2-actin was observed, consistent with the cytotoxicity observed with this dose. IFA performed on proteasome inhibitortreated HeLa cells was consistent with the Western blot analysis (Fig. 4) . PS1 and MG132 treatment in HeLa cells reduced the detectable levels of both NS1 (Fig. 4A ) and NS3 (Fig. 4B ), although PS1 appeared to be more effective than MG132, consistent with our previous studies. Interestingly, both PS1 and MG132 appeared to be more effective at blocking NS1 protein accumulation than NS3, although the significance of this is not known (Fig. 4) . IFA performed on proteasome inhibitor-treated Huh7 cells showed a similar reduction in both NS1 and NS3 levels (results not shown). DAPI and phalloidin counterstains indicated that inhibitor-treated cells did not have any nuclear abnormalities or any major defects in their overall cellular architecture, arguing against a non-specific effect of the inhibitor on WNV genome amplification.",

Surprisingly, treatment with the inhibitors (either MG-132 or PI-1) as late as 12 h post infection resulted in a reduction in WNV-dependent FLuc and antigen accumulation (Figs. 6A, B) . In fact, at 0 and 2 h post-infection, the inhibition of WNV activity was nearly to the same extent observed when the drugs were added prior to infection. However, the inhibitory effect of these inhibitors on WNV genome amplification appears to wane at the later times post-infection with only a 50-60% reduction in WNV activity at 12 h post infection for all but the highest doses of each of the drugs (Fig. 6) .

Since proteasome inhibitor treatment had no effect on the ability of WNV hFLuc VRPs to infect cells, monolayers of HeLa cells were infected with WNV for 1 h prior to MG132 or PS1 treatment and assayed for WNV accumulation in the supernatant fluid 24 h later. Titrations performed on supernatants harvested from the treated cells indicated that proteasome inhibitor treatment dramatically reduced the production of infectious WNV particles (Fig. 7) . MG132 treatment of HeLa cells, as observed in WNV VRP experiments, was slightly less effective at impairing WNV production compared to PS1 treatment; however, the treated cells still demonstrated a near 80% reduction in secreted infectious particles compared to mock-treated cells with as little as 0.16 \u03bcM (Fig. 7) . PS1, on the other hand, demonstrated inhibition of WNV particle release similar to MG132 at a concentration of only 0.032 \u03bcM (Fig. 7) . The inhibition of WNV release was consistent with the inhibition of WNV VRP-induced FLuc activity and WNV antigen accumulation. These data indicate that inhibiting proteasome activity in these cell lines severely impairs the WNV genome amplification, suggesting that the proteasome is an important cellular co-factor during WNV replication.",

Beyond the host machinery required for entry and translation, such as receptors present on the cell surface (Chu and Ng, 2004b; Davis et al., 2006; Medigeshi et al., 2008) , acidification of endosomes (Chu and Ng, 2004a) and translation factors (Davis et al., 2007) , WNV likely requires additional host proteins to establish an environment permissive for efficient replication. For example, the interaction between WNV 3\u2032 stem loop structure and two host proteins, TIA-1 and TIAR (Li et al., 2002) , has been shown to interfere with the cell's ability to form stress granules, effectively preventing the host cell from shutting down viral and cellular translation (Emara and Brinton, 2007) . Here we report that the proteasome may serve as an essential co-factor during the WNV replication cycle.",

            "text": "The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the primary mechanism for intracellular, extralysosomal protein degradation. It plays a key role in a variety of cell functions, including cell cycle regulation, antigen processing, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, signal transduction and transcriptional regulation (Ciechanover, 1994; Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002; Goldberg et al., 2002; Nandi et al., 2006) . Because of its involvement in a vast array of functions, it is not surprising that multiple viruses have evolved mechanisms to manipulate this system to its own advantage. Influenza virus has been shown to utilize the ubiquitin-proteasome system for efficient trafficking through the late endosome/lysosome stages of virus entry (Khor et al., 2003) . Mouse hepatitis virus (a coronovirus) and minute virus (a parvovirus) have also been shown to utilize the proteasome system for trafficking to the cytoplasm (Yu and Lai, 2005) or the nucleus (Ros et al., 2002; Ros and Kempf, 2004) , respectively. Multiple members of the Herpesviridae family have evolved different mechanisms to manipulate the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, whether it is by encoding ubiquitin ligaselike proteins (Coscoy et al., 2001) or by targeting specific proteins for destruction (Coscoy et al., 2001; Kikkert et al., 2001; Parkinson et al., 1999; Prosch et al., 2003) . Inhibition of proteasome activity was shown to impair coxsackievirus B3 replication (Luo et al., 2003) . A recent report indicated that coxsackievirus-induced activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, which is required for its replication (Luo et al., 2002) , is reduced following proteasome inhibition (Wong et al., 2007) , suggesting a possible mechanism of proteasome action. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway also appears to be a critical factor in the lifecycle of HIV, as well. Efficient processing of Gag polyproteinand subsequent release and maturation of HIV particlesis dependent upon ubiquitin-proteasome activities (Patnaik et al., 2000; Schubert et al., 2000; Strack et al., 2000) .",

Our studies were based on an unbiased screen of host factors, systematically knocking down nearly 5500 human genes using a library of siRNAs. Throughout the initial screening process, and multiple confirmatory screens, silencing multiple different subunits of the proteasome dramatically reduced WNV infection and/or genome amplification. In fact, siRNAs targeted against two alpha subunits, PSMA1 and PSMA2, consistently knocked down WNV VRP infection and/or genome amplification levels by greater than 70% compared to non-targeting negative control siRNAs. A similar screen performed with live WNV also showed that silencing proteasome subunits has a negative effect on WNV infection/genome amplification (Krishnan et al., 2008) . Consistent with these results showing that posttranslational silencing of two proteasome genes could impair WNV replication, we showed that treatment of cells with micromolar concentrations of two well-characterized proteasome inhibitors (MG132 and PS1) resulted in impaired the activity of WNV VRPs and live WNV, indicating that a functional proteasome is required for WNV genome amplification.",

However, the library consisted of a relatively small subset of genes (5500 genes from the 30,000 genes encoded by the human genome) which are currently known to be involved in many different disease processes. Even within this subset of genes, it is very likely that many were overlooked, due to the presence of compensatory pathways, the expression of homologues or the failure of specific siRNAs to efficiently silence their target. Although silencing many different proteasome subunits had an effect on WNV activity in the initial siRNA library screen we performed, PSMA1 and PSMA2 were the only two genes to consistently knockdown WNV activity in all secondary screens. This was puzzling; however, we believe that this is likely due to the quality of the siRNAs in the initial library. As mentioned above, not all siRNAs are equally effective, especially the 'first-generation' siRNAs (which were not optimized or modified to enhance their activity) used in the initial siRNA library. Thus, it is likely that the siRNAs for other proteasome subunits were either not as specific or as effective at silencing their target gene compared to PSMA1 and PSMA2 siRNAs. Because the proteasome is composed of many different subunits we had multiple opportunities to silence its expression. Thus, it appears that this type of multisubunit complex is particularly well suited for discovery with function-based siRNA screening strategies.",

Post-treatment of WNV VRP-infected cells with MG132 and PS1 severely impaired WNV VRP genome amplification, indicating that the proteasome was not required for viral entry. In fact, both MG132 and PS1 were effective inhibitors of WNV VRP activity up to 12 h post infection, suggesting that it is unlikely that the proteasome is required for the endosomal trafficking of WNV particles or the uncoating the viral RNA, as it has been shown for influenza (Khor et al., 2003) and mouse hepatitis virus (Yu and Lai, 2005) . The timing of the WNV life cycle is not well established and is expected to vary between cell types. The process of viral entry and genome unpackaging likely occurs within the first 2 h. Because WNV is a positive-stranded RNA virus, the newly unpackaged genome can be transported to cellular membranes and immediately be translated by cellular machinery.",

Our studies do not exclude the possibility that the proteasome is involved at these stages of infection; however, our initial studies demonstrating impairment in WNV genome amplification were performed with WNV VRPs, which are not packaged.

The WNV NS2A-NS3 complex serves as the viral protease and is required for the proper processing of the viral polyprotein and subsequent genome replication. It is possible that the proteasome inhibitors, or the proteasome itself, could have an effect on the protease activity of NS2A-NS3. However, although there was a decrease in the expression of all detectable viral proteins, there did not appear to be any abnormal banding patterns associated with impaired protein processing from proteasome inhibitor-treated cells (results not shown). This suggested that it is unlikely that inhibiting the proteasome has a direct negative effect on viral polyprotein processing.",

As expected, a decrease in the expression of both NS1 and NS3 in the presence of the inhibitors was readily detected; however, it appeared as though the effect on NS1 expression was more pronounced than the effect on NS3. There could be several reasons for this curious effect. It is possible that the antibody against NS3 is more sensitive than the antibody against NS1, particularly with MG132 treatment. It is also possible that viral proteins have different turn-over rates. The location of NS1 within secretory pathways of the infected cell may also concentrate the antigen, making it more visible than NS3. Nevertheless, our data clearly demonstrate a role for the proteasome at post-entry stages of WNV infection, although we have not yet determined whether the reduction in antigen accumulation/expression is due to a direct inhibition of viral translation or an inhibition of viral genome replication (which would also reduce translational products).",

The ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in a variety of normal cellular processes, including signal transduction, transcriptional 7 . Proteasome inhibition impairs WNV particle release. Monolayers of HeLa cells were infected with WNV for 1 h, the virus was removed and the indicated concentrations of MG132 or PS1 were added to the infected cells. Twenty-four hours post infection/treatment the supernatants were removed from the treated cells and the titration of each sample was determined by IHC (see Materials and methods). Results are shown as percent virus titer from mock-treated cells. Error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean between three independent experiments. regulation, the immune response and apoptosis, any of which could be tied to WNV replication. Although WNV has been shown by several groups to interfere with IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling by preventing STAT1 phosphorylation (Guo et al., 2005; Scholle and Mason, 2005) , this impairment has not been shown to be achieved by the degradation of a specific protein. More recently, Medigeshi et al. has demonstrated that WNV induces the degradation of ATF6, a transcription factor associated with the ER, in a proteasome-dependent fashion (Medigeshi et al., 2007) . However, their studies were performed with live WNV at 36 h post infection while ours were performed with WNV VRPs at 24 h post infection. In our hands, WNV VRP infection does not cause observable apoptosis at 24 h post infection. Associations between proteasome inhibition of WNV VRP replication genome amplification and the degradation of ATF6 may be of interest to investigate. Nevertheless, it is possible that WNV targets specific protein(s) to the proteasome and that disrupting their degradation has a negative impact on WNV genome amplification. The identity of such proteins will have to be investigated in more detail.",

Treated cell monolayers were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton-X-100. The fixed monolayers were incubated in blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin, 5% normal horse serum, 10 mM glycine in PBS) for 30 min and then probed using the following monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies: mouse anti-NS1 (Eiji; Kobe University, Kobe, Japan), goat anti-NS3 (R and D Systems), Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen). Following secondary antibody incubation, the cells were counterstained with DAPI (500 ng/ml) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated phalloidin (R. Davey, UTMB) for nuclei and actin filaments, respectively. The monolayers were then mounted using VectaShield (Vector Laboratories) and stained cells were analyzed with a 1.0 Zeiss LSM 510 UV META Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope at the UTMB Infectious Disease and Toxicology Optical Imaging Core Facility.",
