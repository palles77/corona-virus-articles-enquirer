Beijing has undergone significant socioeconomic changes in last decade, however no large-scale community epidemiological surveys of MDD have been conducted in Beijing since 2003. Aims: To determine the prevalence of MDD and its socio-demographic correlates in a representative household sample of the general population in Beijing, China. Method: Data were collected from the 2010 representative household epidemiological survey of mental disorders in Beijing. The multistage cluster random sampling method was used to select qualified subjects in 18 districts and counties, and then face-to-face interviews were administered using the Chinese version of Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders-Patient Edition (SCID-I/P) during Results: 19,874 registered permanent residents were randomly identified and 16,032 (response rate\u00bc80.7%) completed face-to-face interviews. The time-point and life-time prevalence rates of MDD were estimated to be 1.10% (95% CI: 0.94-1.26%) and 3.56% (95% CI: 3.27-3.85%) respectively. Significant differences were found in sex, age, location of residence, marital status, education, employment status, personal/family monthly income, perception of family environment and relationship with others, when comparing residents with MDD to those without MDD.",

Conclusions: The prevalence of MDD reported in this survey is relatively lower than that in other western countries. Female sex, age older than 45, low family income, and poor family environment appear to be independent risk factors for MDD.",

The most-cited national survey was undertaken in twelve regions of China in 1982 (n\u00bc38,136) Group, 1986) , and repeated with almost identical case ascertainment strategies in seven regions in 1993 (n\u00bc 19,223) . In the 1982 survey, the point and lifetime prevalence of affective disorder was 0.037% and 0.076% (Zhao et al., 1986) ; in the 1993 survey, the point and lifetime prevalence of affective disorder was 0.052% and 0.083%, and no evidence of an increase was found in the prevalence of affective disorders (Wang et al., 1998) .",

            "text": "To address the lack of data, especially after the turn of the century, a few large-scale epidemiological studies were conducted. These were well-designed, population-based surveys that used structured psychiatric interviews. They have indeed found higher rates of depression in China, though the comparability to older studies is limited. For example, Shen et al. (2006) reported a psychiatric epidemiological survey in Beijing and Shanghai (the two largest metropolitan cities in China). They interviewed 5201 subjects (2633 in Beijing and 2568 in Shanghai respectively) using a multistage household probability sampling method, and all subjects were also assessed with a Chinese version of the World Health Organization World Mental Health WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO MH-CIDI). They found that the 12-month prevalence of any DSM-IV mental disorder in metropolitan China was 7.0%, with major depressive disorder (2.0%) being the most common. These studies suggest that, although it is not as common as that in Western populations, depression in the Chinese population is still a relatively common mental disorder which deserves more attention. Phillips et al. (2009) used a Chinese version of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV axis I disorders (SCID-I/P) and a two-stage screening process to define the prevalence and characteristics of mental disorders in 4 provinces (Shandong, Zhejiang, Qinghai, and Gansu provinces) from 2001 to 2005. They reported the adjusted one-month prevalence of a major depressive episode (MDE) was 1.55% and 2.60% for men and women, respectively. Another study, conducted in Beijing in 2003 involved a much larger sample (N \u00bc5926 adults) and also used the WHO MH-CIDI (version 1.0). They reported the time-point prevalence rate of depressive disorder was 3.31% while the life-time prevalence rate was 6.87%. Unfortunately, the study was interrupted and forced to end prematurely due to the unexpected outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing in 2003. 15.69% of the target respondents did not complete the interview (Ma et al., 2007) . The impact of the outbreak on the results is unknown, and given the large number of incomplete interviews, the data may not generalize to the greater Beijing population.",

Given that socioeconomic development and mental health status of the population are inter-related, some even speculate that modern environments may cause an epidemic of mental illness (Lee et al., 2007; Hidaka, 2012) . To address the mental health issues related to this new socioeconomic reality, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of China (now part of the newly established National Health and Family Planning Commission), the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Public Security and the China Disabled Persons Federation have worked closely to formulate China's mental health work plan (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) .

Taking into account the possibility that some would refuse or be unable to participate, we increased the sample size by 20%, resulting in a total of 19,874 residents to be identified. The household was the basic sampling unit in this survey. The average number of residents in each urban household was 2.4, and in each rural household was 2.6.

The training included three major components: (1) General skills: including how to approach a household, how to build rapport, and how to overcome common obstacles. Skills involving advertising the importance of the survey and educating potential respondents were also taught and discussed; (2) Use of interview instruments: this included the field interview procedure, the proper usage of the assessment instruments and possible issues; (3) Clinical interview training at a psychiatric hospital: This was conducted at a psychiatric hospital involving actual patients.",

However, few largescale epidemiological studies have utilized the SCID as a diagnostic tool on a global scale. Different from the WHO MH-CIDI, the SCID was designed to be administered by a clinician or trained mental health professional, which can be very costly. In fact, so far only large-scale epidemiological studies conducted in China (Phillips et al., 2009 ) have used the SCID as an assessment tool. Two major differences between those by Phillips et al. (2009) and the current one are worth pointing out: First, the studies by Phillips et al. (2009) involved a two-stage screening process. In the first stage all subjects were screened with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and classified into three risk strata for mental disorder, and in the second-stage all high-risk respondents and a random selection of moderate or low risk respondents were assigned to complete the diagnostic assessment using the SCID. Second, only less than one third (28%) of the study subjects completed the assessment with the SCID. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first large-scale representative community epidemiological survey in which all respondents were screened using a one-stage investigation method with the SCID performed by mental health professionals. These are the most notable strengths of this study. Another strength of this study was the sampling design: we adopted the cluster stratified random sampling method. The basic sampling unit was the household with all eligible members being included, rather than specific individuals from every household. This method avoided the random selection of others in the absence of the initially selected resident within each household, and decreased possible selection bias.",

However, a number of speculations about the low rates of depression in Chinese have been proposed. (1) Biological factors: several previous studies indicated that the prevalence of depression among the Chinese living on mainland China is not only lower as compared to western populations, but the prevalence of depression among Chinese people living in America is also significantly lower than other ethnic groups (Gonzalez et al., 2010) ; (2) Cultural factors: some believe that the traditional Chinese social and cultural factors and values may play protective roles. For example, Tan (2014) reported the life-time prevalence of MDD in immigrant Chinese women was 8.5% vs 33.1% in US-born Chinese American women, suggesting the collectivist culture might play a protective role. (3) The instrument used in this study was translated from the English language, and some descriptions of emotions may be difficult to understand. It has been suggested in a previous study that the SCID could be less sensitive to the means of expressing emotion in the Chinese population. As a result, the prevalence of depression NOS is relative higher and the prevalence of MDD is relative low (Shi et al., 2005) . (4) The stigmatization of the mentally ill in Chinese society is relatively prevalent. Some tend to somatize psychological problems, and those with a mental disorder may be reluctant to endorse symptoms. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that some people with lifetime MDD fail to report their history of depression in cross-sectional studies (Patten et al., 2011) . This can lead to an underestimation of MDD in a population-based epidemiological study (Kessler et al., 2010b) .",
