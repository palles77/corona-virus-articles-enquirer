Markov matrices provide a convenient way to perform contaminant transport analysis. However, no standardized method exists for calculating these matrices. A methodology based on set theory is developed for calculating contaminant transport in real-time utilizing Markov matrices from CFD flow data (or discrete flow field data). The methodology provides a rigorous yet simple strategy for determining the number and size of the Markov states, the time step associated with the Markov matrix, and calculation of individual entries of the Markov matrix. The procedure is benchmarked against scalar transport of validated airflow fields in enclosed and ventilated spaces. The approach can be applied to any general airflow field, and is shown to calculate contaminant transport over 3000 times faster than solving the corresponding scalar transport partial differential equation. This near real-time methodology allows for the development of more robust sensing and control procedures of critical care environments (clean rooms and hospital wards), small enclosed spaces (like airplane cabins) and high traffic public areas (train stations and airports).",

            "text": "Motivated by these issues, it is clear that methods for prediction and control of these contaminants in indoor environments are needed. In this context, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations have been used extensively for determining airflow in indoor environments. The earliest reference to CFD being used for this purpose was the study of the velocity characteristics of ventilated rooms by P.V. Nielsen et al., in 1978 [27] . Since then the popularity of running CFD simulations for predicting air flow in indoor spaces has increased rapidly. ASHRAE has taken efforts to standardize CFD simulation procedures, i.e. to setup, simulate, and perform both verification and validation [1] . CFD simulations have also been integrated into building simulation programs like Ener-gyPlus [37] and ESP-r [16] for establishing boundary conditions of buoyancy based fluid flow. CFD flow fields have also been used for developing methods for scalar-transport in indoor environments. Validation for multi-zone CFD simulations with contaminant transport has been performed by building researchers [35, 40] . Other validations of scalar contaminant transport has been performed for ventilation efficiency [3] , personal ventilation [22] , occupant exposure [23] and dispersion [21] of toxic contaminants, and dispersion of contaminants in hospital wards [15] . The application of contaminant dispersion in the indoor environment applied to emergency situations was investigated by L. Wang et al. [41] . Many other application of contaminant transport in the indoor environment can also be found in scientific literature. A few examples include identification of sources using an inverse CFD approach [44] , removal of contaminants using different ventilation strategies [17] , and contaminant transport in an airliner by moving bodies [32] .",

Not only can Markov matrices be used for forward propagation of contaminants, but they can also be used for inferring the positions of the contaminants at previous times. The Markov matrix can be used to develop systematic optimization-based procedure for the optimal locations of actuators and sensors for the sensing and control of contaminants [34, 39] . Furthermore, the linear property of a Markov matrix can also be used to develop a systematic procedure using linear system theory for the optimal control and estimation of contaminant [33, 38] . Besides control and estimation applications, the spectral properties of the Markov matrix provides information about the long-term concentration profiles of contaminants in the space and the amount of time contaminants stay at a given position. Thus, utilization of the Markov matrix for flow field analysis and contaminant transport can be used to get more insight than the standard scalar transport methodology. An approach dual to the Markov approach using finite dimension approximation of Koopman operator is proposed by M. Georgescu et al. [14] for reducing order modeling in building system.",

If only one particle is placed at the center of the state the particle represents the entire volume of the state (state 3, 6, and 7 in Fig. 4 ). Then by tracking each particle for a period of time, Dt, both the starting state and destination state are easily determined. Since there is only one particle per cell, the transition is binary. Depending on whether the particle has left the state, the state either experiences a transition or remains in the initial state. In this case state 3 transitioned to state 6, state 6 stayed in the initial state, and state 7 transitioned to state 9. The result of these transitions are expressed in a transition matrix, P ij , Equation (1), where P ij denotes the probability of a particle placed in state i to transition to state j. In this example the entries of the transition matrix would be P (3, 6) \u00bc 1, P (6, 6) \u00bc 1, and P (7, 9) \u00bc 1 for initial states 3, 6, and 7 respectively. If a set of particles are uniformly placed in a state, each particle represents a fraction of the volume of the state, see state in 1 in Thus, the transitions for state 1 become probabilistic. In this example state 1 transitions with a probability of P(1,:) \u00bc [2/9, 1/9, 0, 2/9, 2/9, 0, 1/9, 1/9, 0] for each state 1 through 9. This process can be repeated for each state in the indoor environment. Since the transitions for a given state are probabilistic, the matrix in Equation (1) also has the following properties. All entries of the matrix, P, are positive (Equation (2)) and the row sum of the matrix is equal to one (Equation (3)), i.e. row stochastic. A matrix with these properties is called a Markov matrix. The entries of the Markov matrix are often fairly sparse or limited to a relatively small bandwidth. In order to minimize the memory requirements for the Markov matrix, a sparse matrix format is used. In sparse matrix format only the nonzero entries are stored, thus minimizing the memory used to store the Markov matrix.",

If the number of states is too small, the coarse Markov matrix will smooth out characteristics of the airflow field. If the number of states is too large, the computational time to compute (and use) the Markov matrix increases. As the number of states increase, the computational effort to propagate the contaminant a single time step becomes larger. As the simulation time increases, the ability to run real-time prediction of the contaminant transport may be compromised. Therefore, it is necessary to choose an optimal number of states that balances both speed and accuracy.",

See, for example, the 04 \u00c2 08 distribution compared to the 64 \u00c2 32 distribution in Fig. 5 . As the number of cells increases different velocity scales of the air flow field become resolved. As this occurs, the distribution of the air speeds in the space starts to converge. See, for example, the 32 \u00c2 16 distribution and the 64 \u00c2 32 distribution in Fig. 5 . Using this concept of the standard deviation, Equation (8), of the air speeds resolved by the Markov matrix should provide insight to when the spatial scales of the problem have been resolved. The change in the standard deviation as the size of the Markov states decreases can be quantified by a simple expression, Equation (9) . The refining of the Markov cells continues until the \u03b5 std drops below some tolerance. Based on the experience of the authors, a value of 1% seems to be sufficient for these problems. Larger or smaller values of the air speed standard deviation may be sufficient for other problems. We observe more numerical diffusion with larger thresholds of air speed standard deviations and lower numerical diffusion with smaller thresholds of air speed standard deviation. ",

After the peak, a number of particles start to leave the neighboring states into other states in the domain. Once again for the Rayleigh-B enard problem the noise is due to the states returning to their nearest neighbors after a long time step. The absorbed state curves and the nearest neighbor curves in Figs. 11 and 12 are clearly a function of the Markov state size. As the Markov state size is decreased each of the cures are shifted to the left. Therefore as the Markov state size is decreased, the time steps chosen should also decrease. Also notice that for very large (coarse discretization) Markov state sizes the curves seem to have discontinuous jumps. As the number of states are increased by reducing the size of the states, the curves become smoother. This relationship shows that very coarse Markov states may have an unsatisfactory performance.",

The IEA annex 20 problem took a simulation time of t U max /H \u00bc 0.0315 to evolve the contaminant a total time of t U max / H \u00bc 119.8. These tests used a 1.7 GHz Intel Core i7 processor. The Markov method was able to compute the contaminant transport 6665 times faster than an optimized PDE solver for the Ray-leigheB enard problem and 3723 times faster than an optimized PDE solver for the IEA annex problem.",

Spectral analysis of the Markov matrix is useful to determine the long-term distribution of the contaminants and the time contaminants spend in the occupied space. In particular, the eigenvector with eigenvalue one of the Markov matrix carries information about the steady state or long-term asymptotic distribution of contaminant in the space. Similarly the other part of the spectrum of Markov matrix carry information about almost invariant region in the space where the contaminant spend most of the time before finally exiting these region [12] .",

This work formulates methods to determine the number and size of the Markov states, provides simple equations for the choosing the time step associated with the Markov matrix, and a procedure based on flow physics to determine the number of particles to represent the Markov elements. The methods provided in this work showed excellent agreement with the scalar transport methods well established in the field. An explicit procedure was articulated for application to other indoor airflow problems. For the two example problems the Markov method was able to predict contaminant transport at least 3000 times faster than the corresponding PDE based approach. Although the boundaries of the example problems are geometrically relatively simple, the method is naturally extended to complex boundaries, as well as to transient flow fields. The established methodology created in the paper has been applied to buoyant and inertial driven flow field. This procedure opens the door for realtime sensing and control of airborne infectious diseases, ventilation of indoor environments, and demand response and isolation during biological attacks.",
