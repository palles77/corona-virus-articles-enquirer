The proposed methodology consists of two recursive mechanisms: (1) the time-varying forecasting of medical relief demand and (2) relief distribution. The medical demand associated with each epidemic area is forecast according to a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model. A linear programming approach is then applied to facilitate distribution decision-making. The physical and psychological fragility of affected people are discussed. Numerical studies are conducted. Results show that the consideration of survivor psychology significantly reduces the psychological fragility of affected people, but it barely influences physical fragility.",

            "text": "Although some studies try to combine medical rescue with emergency logistics (Sheu and Pan, 2014) , only a few studies exist on emergency medical logistics for public health emergencies despite its importance and particularity. Only bioterror response logistics, a special case in emergency medical logistics, has been discussed (Kaplan et al., 2003; Craft et al., 2005; Liu and Zhao, 2011) . These studies have aided in understanding the problems of evaluating existing proposals for logistics, distributing antibiotics, and providing hospital care after a bioterror attack. Methods such as atmospheric release models, doseresponse models, disease progression models and epidemic diffusion models have been used. However, these studies have made limited contribution to medical logistics for public health emergencies. First, a terrorist attack has only two most feared biological agents, namely, smallpox and anthrax (Craft et al., 2005) , but other public health emergencies may be aroused by other diseases that are less understood. Second, a terrorist attack focuses on only one or several cities, whereas other public health emergencies may occur in large areas at the same time. Except for the distinctiveness of bioterrorism, these studies ignored the differences in the infection conditions and survivor psychology. In practice, vulnerable groups, such as children and the elderly, face different infection, recovery, and mortality rates. Moreover, the psychological suffering of affected people in a bioterror attack is usually more serious than physical pain.",

The approaches adopted in business logistics forecast are based on historical values, which can be collected easily during business processes. By contrast, emergency medical logistics lacks historical data. Gaur et al. (2007) discussed demand uncertainty in business logistics, but demand history was unavailable. Based on the characteristics of the predictions of emergency resource demand, Sheu (2010) presented a dynamic model of relief-demand management for emergency logistics operations under imperfect information conditions in large natural disasters. Mete and Zabinsky (2010) proposed forecasting and optimization approaches to problems on medical storage and distribution for a wide variety of disaster types and magnitudes. Hasan and Ukkusuri (2011) developed a novel model to understand the cascade of the warning information flow in social networks during the hurricane evacuations. Fajardo and Gardner (2013) used a bi-linear integer program to model diseases spreading through direct human interaction on a social-contact network. Ekici et al. (2014) created an interesting approach to demand forecasting based on the characteristics of disease epidemics. They also developed a SEIR model with a spatial component among communities, age-based structure, heterogeneous mixing, and night/day differentiation to plan food distribution. Few studies have forecast demand in this way (Wang and Wang, 2008; Liu and Zhao, 2011) , even though scholars have conducted much research on preventing and controlling epidemics, as well as identifying their characteristics and models.",

Most models, including the susceptible-infectious, susceptible-infectious-removed, susceptible-infectious-susceptible, susceptible-infectious-removed-susceptible, susceptible-exposed-infectious, and SEIR model, are suitable for studying the general laws of all epidemics. In particular, SEIR model, which considers incubation period, has drawn considerable attention. In the real world, there is some duration between the time that a person is infected and the time that he/she starts infecting others. SEIR model divided the people in epidemic areas into four classes: susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered. The model describes the transition among these classes with differential equations. Basic reproduction number is an important concept in epidemic model. It determines the global dynamics and the outcome of disease. If it is less than or equal to 1, the disease-free equilibrium is globally stable and the disease always dies out; otherwise, there exists a unique positive endemic equilibrium and the disease persists at an endemic equilibrium state if it initially exists (Hethcote and Tudor, 1980; Greenhalgh, 1992; Li and Muldowney, 1995; Li et al., 1999; Zhang and Ma, 2003) .",

In these studies, the two populations compete for survival resource or have a predatorprey relation. The second type involves age-structured models (Cha et al., 1998; Li and Song, 2011) that are unable to describe the vulnerable people because they can be distinguished not only by age but also by other characteristics, such as gender.

Stochastic programming is also an appropriate tool for making emergency logistics decisions and has been applied to different cases of emergency management (Barbaroso and Arda, 2004; Beraldi et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2007; Zhan et al., 2014) . Han et al. (2013) present a novel approach to consider a vehicle routing problem with uncertain travel times in which a penalty is incurred for each vehicle that exceeds a given time limit.",

Disasters have negative psychological effects on affected people and can even manifest as a major depressive episode, acute stress disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. Hu and Sheu (2013) developed a multi-objective linear programming model to minimize total reverse logistical costs, corresponding environmental and operational risks, and psychological trauma experienced by local residents while they waited for medical treatment and removal of debris. Rooted in survival psychology and cognition theories, Sheu (2014) proposes a emergency logistics operational model that aims at disaster relief-service distribution to maximize survivor resilience. In Hu et al. (2014) , a mixed-integer linear program is constructed for multi-step evacuation and temporary resettlement under minimization of panic-induced psychological penalty cost, psychological intervention cost, and costs associated with transportation and building shelters. Negative psychological effects of widespread disease epidemics are usually more significant. For the public, the psychological effect of an epidemic may be greater than the danger to physical health (Cheng and Tang, 2004) . Maunder et al. (2003) examined the psychological and the occupational effects of SARS in a large hospital in Canada in 2003.",

This work applies the theorem in the second manner. Equilibrium is disregarded in the distribution model (Eqs. (10)-(21)). The existence of a positive equilibrium is then determined. If equilibrium exists in some areas, then the government should adjust relevant policies (not logistics policies) to prevent diseases from spreading in the long run. An example of such adjustments involves investments in exogenous parameters, such as diagnosis rate and contact coefficient. Equilibrium is not set as a constraint because this behavior is less important than the transient behavior for a particular application to a sudden emergency related to a new strain of epidemic disease.

(2) The parameters for disease (recovery rate, diagnosed rate, mortality, and incubation period) are set. Dctors and medical experts can generally estimate the expected values of these parameters shortly after a new disease is recognized in a region. In this study, they are obtained from several medical reports and statistics (National Health and Family Planning Commission of P.R. China, 2004; Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention; Kamps and Hoffmann, 2003) . (3) Infection rates are set with two methods. First, these rates can be obtained by fitting the forecasting curve with observations given epidemic areas with adequate infectious cases. In this study, the infection rates in Guangzhou (j = 1) and Zhongshan (j = 5) are set in this manner. The objective function of fitting is to min- estimated value. Given epidemic areas with a few infectious cases, these rates can also be set by comparing specific areas with the areas listed above in terms of previous cases of similar epidemic outbreak. In this study, infection rates in the other four areas (j = 2, 3, 4, 6) are set in this manner. For example, the infection rates of influenza and pneumonia in Guangzhou (j = 1) is 0.05 lower than those in Foshan (j = 2). Thus b c 2 \u00bc b c 1 \u00fe 0:05 and b v 2 \u00bc b v 1 \u00fe 0:05. The following table compares demand forecasting in Guangzhou (j = 1) as an example. Although accurate parameters can be obtained at present, this study attempts to recreate a specific situation in which a new, little-know epidemic outbreak is reported. Table 2 shows that all four models are valid in terms of forecasting prophylactic demanders. In combination with Fig. 4 , this table illustrates that the performance of these models differ with respect to forecasting the numbers of treatment demanders. The methods proposed in this paper perform better than standard SEIR model and moving average method in the initial two weeks, but then the error rate increases rapidly. The main reason for this trend is the development of preventive and therapeutic methods as doctors amass additional knowledge about SARS. Nonetheless, accurate forecasting for two weeks is enough to facilitate distribution decision-making. In addition, the models proposed in this paper can forecast every group in the population, unlike the moving average method. This advantage is useful in distributional decision-making.",

(3) The amount of reliefs distributed increase for epidemic areas with a large input population that originates from severely infected areas when the spatial interaction relationships among epidemic areas are considered. In this case, additional prophylactic reliefs are sent to Shenzhen (j = 6) to avoid the spread of SARS. The reason for this outcome is that this area has a large input population coming from Guangzhou (j = 1) and Zhongshan (j = 5). These areas are the most severely. Moreover, the number of residents in Shenzhen (j = 6) is small. Guangzhou (j = 1) is less affected although the input from Zhongshan (j = 5) to this area (j = 1) is larger given that Guangzhou (j = 1) has much more residents. (4) The amount of prophylactic reliefs distributed increases for epidemic areas with low diagnosis rates when survivor psychology is considered. In this case, the diagnosis rate of Heyuan (j = 4) is the lowest and many infectious people have not realized that they are infected. Infectious but undiagnosed individuals share a physical state with those who have been diagnosed, but their psychological characteristics differ. Therefore, more prophylactic relief is sent to Heyuan (j = 4) in Extended Model 2 than in Extended Model 1. (5) The number of distribution paths that report long transportation times decreases when survivor psychology is considered. A long distribution time increases psychological fragility. In this case, the distribution paths from EMRC 4 to Guangzhou (j = 1) and to Jiangmen (j = 3) are avoided in Extended Model 2, unlike in the other two models. In a case of emergency medical logistics following a large-scale disaster, the effect of survivor psychology on path selection is strengthened because destroyed infrastructure may increase transportation time.
