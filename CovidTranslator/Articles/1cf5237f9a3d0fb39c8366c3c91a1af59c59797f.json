Samples were collected from each calf at days 1, 7 and 14. Within the 14 day period, 44 calves (94%) were positive for group A rotavirus and an unexpectedly high number of calves (38 calves, 81%) were positive for group B rotavirus. When these samples were examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), rotavirus was found in 21 calves and all of them had group A electropherotype. Among 25 PAGE positive samples from 21 calves, 17 (68%) were of short electropherotype, 4 (28%) were of long electropherotype and 4 (28%) contained both short and long electropherotype rotaviruses. Group B and short and long electropherotype group A rotaviruses were found in both normal and diarrheic calves.",

Only a few cases of group B rotavirus detection have been reported in cattle in the U.S.A. [7] [8] [9] [10] . In the U.K., 91% and 20% of cattle were seropositive for group A and B rotaviruses, respectively [3] . In Argentina, 53% of diarrheic calves and 7% of normal calves were positive for group A rotavirus [28] . The high prevalence of group A and group B rotaviruses observed in this study was probably due to the higher sensitivity of RT-PCR assays. RT-PCR, compared to other assays which included the cell culture, immunofluorescent assay, PAGE and ELISA used in other studies, was more sensitive. Alternatively, the high percentage of infection may represent the high prevalence of rotavirus infection in dairy calves in California.",

            "text": "Two unique features were observed regarding group A rotavirus infection in calves. Firstly, more calves were found positive at days 7 and 14 than at day 1. It is unlikely that the shorter exposure time of the l-day old calves to rotavirus-contaminated environment was the factor since no differences in the prevalence of group B rotavirus was found in the same calves sampled on the same days. In gnotobiotic pigs and calves, group B rotavirus infection has a more rapid onset, leading to diarrhea and shedding of virus earlier than group A rotavirus (12-24h vs 24-36 h post exposure in pigs) [8] . As a result, at day 1 we could detect most group B infected calves but only some of group A infected calves. In addition, this might be due to the immune status of calves. Rotavirus infections in cattle are enzootic; thus, most cows have rotavirus antibodies in their colostrum [29] . The concentration of these antibodies declines to low or nondetectable levels (approx. 100-fold decrease) in the transition from colostrum to milk [29] . These newborn calves, which were fed colostrum during the first day, might have a higher level of passive immunity to group A rotavirus than did older calves. Therefore, these newborn calves were better protected from group A rotavirus infection. Secondly, group A infected calves shed the virus for at least 14 days if they were infected at day 1 but they could shed the virus for less than 7 days if they were infected later. The newborn calves might be more severely affected when they were infected at birth and they were less capable of mounting a response to eliminate the virus than were the infected older calves. Calves could also become reinfected with different group A rotavirus. The observation that different electropherotypes were found in calves (at days 1, 7 or 14) when more than one sample from the same calves were positive by PAGE confirmed this assumption. On the other hand, a similar number of group B rotavirus infected calves were detected at day 1, 7 and 14. Passive immunity to group B rotavirus might be low because the low titer of group B rotavirus shed in feces (all samples were negative for group B rotavirus on PAGE which had limited sensitivity) limited the exposure of cows to group B rotavirus. In several cases, calves positive for group B rotavirus at day 1 were negative at day 7 (while those positive for group A rotavirus at day 1 were positive for at least 14 days). This correlated to a previous report indicating that group B rotavirus infected gnotobiotic calves shed fewer virus particles for a shorter period than did group A rotavirus infected calves [8] .",

These samples were of different electropherotypes probably due to the fact that these calves were brought in from different herds. Reinfection with a strain possessing different electropherotype and mixed infection could be the result of the cocirculation of strains possessing various electropherotypes within this calf ranch. Previous reports suggested that, with a few exceptions, only one electropherotype was detected from diarrheic calves in the same herd over a short time [14, 30] . In our study, only 2 samples (calves no. 29 and 36, Table 1 ) from the closed dairy herd were positive by PAGE and they were of different electropherotypes. This result differed from the reports mentioned above, although only one of these two samples (calf no. 36) was associated with diarrhea.",

Short electropherotype rotaviruses similar to the rotaviruses previously reported in humans, rabbits, pigs and calves [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] were found in all day 1 PAGE positive and most of day 7 PAGE positive samples obtained from calves while long electropherotype rotaviruses were found at days 7 and 14. Regardless of their electropherotypes, the presence of these short and long electropherotype rotaviruses might be due to their antigenic difference from common rotaviruses contaminating the farm environment; thus, they were able to evade passive immunity.",
