The data thus collected were analyzed and the results were distributed to systems and individuals responsible for control actions. Epidemiological surveillance was the beginning of a new era of infectious disease control. In recent years, surveillance activities have been expanded from infectious diseases to chronic diseases and automobile accidents and other injuries; in addition, long-term data collection such as vital statistics and surveillance of health-related social or economic activities have been surveyed systematically. In this article, we discuss surveillance systems and activities on which public health control action is based.",

            "text": "Around the mid-twentieth century when infectious diseases were a major problem and menace to public health, two medical experts attempted to set up surveillance as an essential component of public health practice. Alexander Langmuir, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), developed systematic surveillance mechanisms for infectious diseases and associated control programs. In 1963, he outlined surveillance as: (1) systematic and active collection of pertinent data of target disease (s); (2) assessment and practical report of these data; and (3) the timely dispatch of such reports to individuals responsible for formulation of action plans. It is important to note that surveillance would not be useful unless data are known and acted upon by individuals responsible for initiating action plans. A surveillance system, in principle, does not include the control measures within its system. A surveillance system is better if it is independent from the control system, because experience has shown that on some occasions, disease prevalence was artificially modified by individuals who were responsible for control measures and sought to gain seemingly better results than what was actually occurring. In the 1960s, Karel Raska, Communicable Disease Division at the World Health Organization (WHO) headquarters, further expanded the system's definition, including epidemiological research in surveillance activities. He promoted a surveillance study, for example by strengthening smallpox surveillance and approving special research funds to the newly intensified eradication program in 1967; malaria surveillance was intensified when the effectiveness of malaria control was demonstrated with investigation of malaria prevalence rates in patients using or not using mosquito nets.",

For example, global surveillance on certain diseases may have certain weaknesses because adequate information is not available from areas because of political unrest, disinterest, poorly developed infrastructure, etc. The Agency for Cooperation in International Health (ACIH), a Japanese nongovernmental organization, has developed a voluntary sentinel surveillance system for selected target diseases, covering South America, Africa, and Asia. Its aim is to add more disease information and thus contribute to global epidemiological surveillance headed by WHO. The AGSnet (Alumni for Global Surveillance network) was organized in 1998. It consists of selected experts and managers who participated in several infectious-disease courses that were sponsored by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and organized by ACIH. As of May 2006, the group consisted of 59 sentinel sites in 32 countries ( Figure 7) . Sentinels are divided into three categories: Hospitals and clinics, laboratories, and blood transfusion centers. Feedback from ACIH consists of selected epidemic information in the media and WHO and various surveillance articles published by medical journals. Despite a limited geographical coverage, the system seems to supplement disease information being obtained by global surveillance, as described in Table 1 . The system has found unreported infectious diseases of international importance, including cholera, plague, and influenza. The surveillance data on prevalence of hepatitis B and C, HIV, and syphilis in blood donors from blood transfusion centers is unique, not usually available in the global surveillance network.

Only when the disease became rare was laboratory confirmation needed. This greatly simplified the surveillance procedures. 3. As mentioned earlier, rewards were offered to the public who reported suspected smallpox and when it was confirmed by laboratory diagnosis. 4. In India, despite their intensive national vaccination program with the target of 100% coverage of the entire population for more than 5 years, transmission continued (Figure 10) . During the 2-year certification period, every surveillance method was employed to search for hidden foci in the previously smallpox-endemic countries and their adjacent countries, with special house-to-house visit surveillance. Two years were determined to be the necessary period of such surveillance, based on the fact Figure 9 Clinical manifestation is typical for smallpox. Hence, usual report does not need laboratory confirmation. It is only needed to confirm the freedom of case. that it was known that 9 months had been the longest period between a false date of a last case and a true date of a last case in Africa. For safety, the 9 months were doubled to roughly 2 years.",

Laboratory investigation for anti-measles IgM antibodies of suspected measles cases is important to confirm or exclude measles virus infection. A single serum specimen collected within 28 days of rash onset is used for the diagnosis. In previously vaccinated persons, there may be a small increased risk of not detecting an IgM response to measles when specimens are collected more than 2 weeks after rash onset due to the increased rate of IgM decay.

The STEPS approach is based on the concept that noncommunicable disease surveillance systems need to be simple, focusing on a minimum number of risk factors that predict disease, before placing too much emphasis on costly disease registries that are difficult to sustain over the long term, especially in low-and middle-income countries. STEPS is a sequential process, starting with the gathering of information on key risk factors by the use of questionnaires (sociodemographic features, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and fruit and vegetable intake); then, taking simple physical measurements (height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure); and lastly, collecting blood samples for biochemical assessment (measurement of lipid and glucose levels).",

According to WHO data for 2000, an estimated 5 million people die each year as a result of some form of injury, comprising almost 9% of all deaths worldwide. Road traffic and selfinflicted injuries are the leading causes. The costs of injury mortality and morbidity are immense in terms of lost economic opportunity, demands on national health budgets, and personal suffering. Nevertheless, few countries have surveillance systems that generate reliable information on the nature and frequency of injuries. Aiming to collect better information and, in turn, to develop effective prevention programs, the WHO, in collaboration with the U.S. CDC, produced manuals on how to set up surveillance systems for collecting, coding, and processing data. In active surveillance, injury cases are sought out and investigated; injured persons are interviewed and followed up. For example, active surveillance of child abuse cases would involve identifying and locating cases through a variety of sources, such as police reports, social agencies, and educational authorities. It might involve seeking out the abused children, their parents, and/or the appropriate authorities, conducting interviews and follow-up. In passive surveillance, relevant information is collected in the course of doing other routine tasks. For example, doctors are routinely required to fill out death certificates for legal purposes, but it is possible to extract information entered on those certificates to obtain data on deaths from injuries. Forms filled out by doctors or nurses for medical insurance purposes can also be used for surveillance purposes. Other potential sources of data on fatal injuries include autopsy/ pathology reports and police reports, and on severe nonfatal injuries, trauma registries, and ambulance or emergency medical technician records. In Japan, the statistics on fatal and nonfatal injuries, including accidents and suicide, are available based on police reports, the Population Survey Report, and death certificates. In addition to a hospital-based surveillance system, community-based surveys may provide a complement to capture further reports on injury events and deaths in the community. Those treated outside the formal health sector or those with minor injuries that do not necessarily require hospital attention might be missed by a hospital-based surveillance system, so that community-based surveys are one way of obtaining injury events within a community. Surveillance on this type of health hazards will become an important surveillance function in today's world, depending upon the level and extent of the health hazard in individual nations ( Figure 12 ).",

The situation is further worsening by expanding inequality. Of 6 billion people in the world, 1.5 billion (15%) live at a level of poverty of $1-2 per day (Table 3) . Thus, in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, extreme poverty and the prevalence of severe diseases cause a vicious cycle and pose a threat to neighboring geographical regions. The situation makes conducting surveillance ineffective and complicated, coupled with the inadequacy of health services under the strain of limited resources and in some areas of political unrest. In these circumstances, the importance of global collaboration to strengthen area-wide surveillance was increasingly recognized in the late twentieth century and early in this century.",

Its appearance in Europe has also been ascribed to the spread of the infection from the tropics, the severity of the disease being attributed to its introduction to a nonimmune population. Nevertheless, what is clear is that a major pathological entity appeared in late fifteenth-century Europe, spreading quickly throughout the Continent, and then on to India (1498) and China (1505). The spread of infection was influenced by a combination of factors including socioeconomic change, conflict, and migration. Syphilis affected the whole of society and had far-reaching consequences. The response to the infection -blame, shame, stigma, and intolerance -reflects the attitude of society to sexually transmitted diseases over the subsequent centuries, and anticipates the reaction to the emergence of HIVat the end of the twentieth century. The element of blame in the epidemic of this new virulent disease is clear in the names it was given; terms such as the 'Italian,' 'Spanish,' and 'Polish' disease were coined by neighboring and rival countries, as well as more generic terms such as the 'Great Pox' and 'lues venereum' (venereal disease). However, it was the word 'syphilis,' derived from the name of a shepherd who suffered from the condition in Girolamo Fracastoro's poem Syphilis Sive Morbus Gallicus, or Syphilis and the French Disease (1530), that came to be used universally. The effect of syphilis on society was profound and has been documented by artists, writers, and historians over the subsequent centuries (Morton, 1990) . From the late Renaissance to the present day, knowledge of the infection has developed in line with advances in anatomy, physiology, microbiology, pharmacology, and epidemiology. The association between syphilis and cardiovascular disease was first described by Lascis (1654-1720), and neurosyphilis and congenital syphilis by Fournier (1832 Fournier ( -1914 . In the absence of diagnostic methods at that time, the noted Scottish scientist and surgeon John Hunter (1728-93) believed that syphilis and gonorrhoea were the same disease, and it was not until 1838 that Philippe Ricord's study of 2500 human inoculations showed that syphilis and gonorrhoea in fact had separate etiologies. Ricord also categorized the natural history of syphilitic infection into primary, secondary, and tertiary syphilis, the classification that is still used today. Given the huge diversity of presenting symptoms seen at the tertiary stage, there was a temptation to attribute any subsequent illness suffered by a patient to syphilis after an attack of the infection, which led Sir William Osler (1849-1919), considered the 'Father of Modern Medicine,' to observe that 'he who knows syphilis knows medicine.'",

In 1906 , Wasserman (1866 -1925 created a serological test for T. pallidum which allowed a more precise understanding of the burden of disease and the associated clinical manifestations. At the beginning of the twentieth century 20% of the European urban population had syphilis, and in the UK a Royal Commission was set up in 1916 to evaluate the threat to public health posed by syphilis and gonorrhoea. Although the UK National Health Service was not created until 1947, the Royal Commission concluded that only state intervention could effectively address the problem. A network of specialist clinics was created that offered confidential diagnosis, treatment, and management, including partner notification. Motivation for this public health measure came as much from the high morbidity associated with venereal disease experienced by the armed forces in World War I as from a concern for the nation's sexual health and the high number of hospitalized patients suffering from the long-term consequences of syphilitic infection.",
