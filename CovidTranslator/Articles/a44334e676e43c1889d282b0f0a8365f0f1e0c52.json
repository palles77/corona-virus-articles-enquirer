The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, with the majority of early cases being reported in the city. The majority of internationally exported cases reported to date have a travel history to Wuhan (2) . In the early stages of a new infectious disease outbreak, it is crucial to understand the transmission dynamics of the infection. In particular, estimation of changes in transmission over time can provide insights into the current epidemiological situation (3) and identify whether outbreak control measures are having a measurable effect (4, 5) . Such analysis can inform predictions about potential future growth (6) , help estimate risk to other countries (7) , and guide the design of alternative interventions (8) .",

There can be a delay to symptom appearance resulting from the incubation period and delay to confirmation of cases resulting from detection and testing capacity (9) . Modelling approaches can account for such delays and uncertainty, by explicitly incorporating delays resulting from the natural history of infection and reporting processes (10) . In addition, individual data sources may be biased, incomplete, or only capture certain aspects of the outbreak dynamics. Evidence synthesis approaches, which fit to multiple data sources rather than a single dataset (or data point) can enable more robust estimation of the underlying dynamics of transmission from noisy data (11, 12) . Combining a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December and February 2020. We then used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases are introduced.",

The delay from onset-to-reporting was assumed to be exponentially distributed with mean 6.1 days (2).

Based on the median reproduction number estimated during January before travel restrictions were introduced, we estimated that a single introduction of 2019-nCoV with SARS-like or MERS-like individual-level variation in transmission would have a 20-28% probability of causing a large outbreak ( Figure 3A ). Assuming SARS-like variation and Wuhan-like transmission, we estimated that once four or more infections have been introduced into a new location, there is an over 50% chance that an outbreak will occur ( Figure 3B ).",

Such fluctuations could be the result of changes in behaviour in the population at risk, or specific superspreading events that inflated the average estimate of transmission (13, 19, 20) . We found some evidence of reduction in R t in the days prior to the introduction of travel restrictions in Wuhan, which may have been reflected outbreak control efforts or growing awareness of SARS-CoV-2 during this period. The uncertainty in our estimates for R t following the decline in early February ( Figure 2A ) results from limited data sources to inform changes in transmission during this period.",

Our estimates for international cases in specific countries were broadly consistent with the number of subsequently confirmed exported cases outside of Wuhan. However, there were notably more cases exported to France, US, and Australia compared to what our model predicted. This may be the result of increased surveillance and detected as awareness of SARS-CoV-2 grew in late January, which would suggest earlier exported cases may have missed; it may also be the result of increased travel out of Wuhan immediately prior to travel restrictions being introduced on 23rd January.",

Even if the reproduction number is as high as it has been in Wuhan in early January, it may take several introductions for an outbreak to establish; this is because high individual-level variation in transmission makes new chains of transmission more fragile, and hence less likely that a single infection will generate out outbreak. This highlights the importance of rapid case identification, and subsequent isolation and other control measures to reduce the chance of onward chains of transmission (21) .",

Our results also have implications for the estimation of transmission dynamics using the number of exported cases from a specific area (22) . Once extensive restrictions are introduced, as they were in Wuhan, the signal from such data gets substantially weaker.

We used plausible biological parameters for SARS-CoV-2 based on current evidence, but these values may be refined as more comprehensive data become available. However, by fitting to multiple datasets to infer model parameters, and performing sensitivity analyses on key areas of uncertainty, we have attempted to make the best possible use of the available evidence about SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Further, we used publicly available connectivity and risk estimates based on international travel data to predict the number of exported cases into each country. These estimates have shown good correspondence with the distribution of exported cases to date (23) , and are similar to another risk assessment for COVID-19 with different data (24) . We also assumed that the latent period is equal to the incubation period (i.e. individuals become infectious and symptomatic at the same time) and all infected individuals will eventually become symptomatic. However, there is evidence that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur with limited reported symptoms (25) . We therefore conducted a sensitivity analysis in which transmission could occur in the second half of the incubation period, but this did not change our overall conclusions (Appendix, page 7). We also explored having a larger initial spillover event and also using different sources for flight connectivity data, neither of which changed the conclusions of the analysis. In our analysis of new outbreaks, we also used estimates of individual-level variation in transmission for SARS and MERS-CoV to illustrate potential dynamics. However, it remains unclear what the precise extent of such variation is for SARS-CoV-2 (13); if transmission were more homogenous than SARS of MERS-CoV, it would increase the risk of outbreaks following introduced cases. As more data becomes available, it will be possible to refine these estimates, and therefore we made an online tool so users can explore these risk estimates if new data become available (Appendix, page 4) Our results demonstrate that there was likely substantial variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission over time, and suggest a decline in transmission in Wuhan in late January around the time that control measures were introduced. If COVID-19 transmission establishes outside of Wuhan, understanding the effectiveness of control measures in different settings will be crucial for understanding the likely dynamics of the outbreak, and the likelihood that transmission can eventually be contained.",
