            "text": "Dear Editor, Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the etiologic agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), which is an acute, highly contagious, and devastating enteric viral disease in pigs (Lee 2015) . PEDV is a coronavirus that mainly infects and replicates in villous enterocytes of the small intestine in pigs (Li et al. 2016) . PEDV can infect pigs in all age groups, with symptoms of varying degrees, such as watery diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting, and growth retardation. Particularly, PEDV is most detrimental to neonatal pigs, and the mortality rates can reach 100% (Stevenson et al. 2013; Lee 2015) . PEDV can persist in pigs after infection and become endemic in the farm. PED outbreaks occur periodically in many countries and have resulted in great economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. Effective infection prevention and control of PEDV can only be achieved through the use of vaccines. However, current field epidemics are complex and heterogeneous because of the rapid variation and evolution of PEDV. The genetic diversity between epidemic field strains and vaccine strains could compromise the effectiveness of vaccinations (Li et al. 2012) . Moreover, a serious mixed infection with strains from different regions and genogroups is prevalent in China, thereby rendering a difficulty for PEDV prevention (Sun et al. 2015 ).",

The strategy has been validated by a proof-of-concept study in which pigs were conferred resistance against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection by modifying the specific viral receptor gene CD163 (Whitworth et al. 2016) . The putative receptor for PEDV infection was considered to be Aminopeptidase N (APN) (Li et al. 2007) . Previous reports showed that expression of pig APN in nonsusceptible cell lines rendered susceptibility to PEDV infection (Li et al. 2007 ). However, the function of APN in PEDV infection remains controversial. Recent studies demonstrated that porcine APN overexpression in nonsusceptible cells failed to support PEDV infection (Shirato et al. 2016; Li et al. 2017) , and the depletion or down-regulation of APN expression in PEDV-susceptible cells had no inhibitory effect on PEDV infection (Li et al. 2017; Ji et al. 2018 ).",

Pig fetal fibroblasts were transfected with a targeting vector based on pX330 (Addgene # 42230) containing a hU6-driven gRNA and a CAG-driven humanized Cas9.

A total of 2,494 embryos were constructed from the selected positive cells and transferred into 11 surrogates. Four surrogates were pregnant to term and delivered 18 live piglets (2 died at day 1 due to weakness at birth) and 5 stillborns ( Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S2 ). Genotyping of the live cloned piglets showed that all of them were biallelic or homozygous KO with out-of-frame indels in exon 2 of APN (Supplementary  Table S3 and Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Intriguingly, the cloned piglet groups derived from # 2-1 were divided into two genotypes, homozygous 1-bp deletion (FF23, FF30, FF35, FF36) and homozygous 1-bp insertion (FF21, FF31). This result indicated that # 2-1, which was originally considered biallelic KO with a 1-bp deletion (D1) in one allele and a 1-bp insertion (?1) in the other allele, was definitely a mixed colony composed of two homozygous KO colonies. We next determined the APN protein expression status in the cloned piglets. Western blot with a rabbit anti-APN antibody (ab183358, Abcam) showed no APN expression in the small intestines of two dead piglets (# 1 & # 2 with D1/D7 genotypes), whereas wild-type (WT) control displayed significant APN expression level (Fig. 1C ). PEDV challenge was performed according to a previous time-course study using 4-week-old feeder pigs (Niederwerder et al. 2016) . A PEDV field isolate (CT, GenBank Accession No. MK539948) from South China was propagated on Vero cells and the 10th generation of PEDV stock (6.0 Log 10 TCID 50 /mL) was used for PEDV challenging in pigs.

            "text": "During the completion of our studies a paper published by Dr. Prather group reported the same modified pigs by zygote injection of CRISPR RNAs (Whitworth et al. 2019) . These pigs showed resistance to porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection. However, only one APN null pig was used in the PEDV challenge test and the results indicated that the APN null pig remained infected by PEDV. Given that APN plays a putative role as a receptor in PEDV infection, a detailed study should be undertaken to compare the difference in infection levels between WT and KO pigs to assess any resistance to PEDV conferred by APN ablation. Our results demonstrated that APN KO and WT pigs had similar clinical signs, fecal shedding and serum antibody levels, thereby excluding its role in PEDV infection. Nonetheless, APN has been identified as a functional receptor for multiple other coronaviruses (Li et al. 2018) , thereby suggesting the importance of APN KO pigs in determining the receptor role of APN for these coronaviruses and in further establishing coronavirus-resistant pigs.",
