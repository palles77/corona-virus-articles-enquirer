The methylthiazol tetrazolium assay was used to evaluate the growth inhibitory effect of Compound 1 on HepG2.2.15 cell. By using ELISA and real-time PCR, respectively, the presence of extracellular hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), e antigen (HBeAg), and HBV DNA were measured. The levels of intracellular HBV DNA and mRNA were determined by using Southern blot or reverse-transcription-PCR, respectively. Intracellular distribution of antigen were measured by Western blot. A 1995 lmol/L concentration of the commercially-available hepatitis B drug, adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), was required to achieve 50% cytotoxicity against cultured cells (CC 50 ) by day nine; in contrast, only 1747 lmol/L of Compound 1 was required for the same result. Treatment of HepG2.2.15 cells with Compound 1 effectively suppress the secretion of HBV antigens and HBV DNA in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. IC 50 values were determined to be 80 lmol/L for HBsAg, 75 lmol/L for HBeAg and 3.72 lmol/L for supernatant HBV DNA at day nine post-exposure, as opposed to 266, 296, 30.09 lmol/L, respectively, for ADV. Intracellular HBV DNA, mRNA and antigen were also found to be decreased by Compound 1. The same dose of ADV yielded a significantly less robust inhibitory effect. Compound 1 can clear HBV from hepatic cells and may represent a therapeutic agent to treat HBV infection.",

RNA viruses and DNA viruses. [9] [10] [11] [12] In particular, decreased activities of the human immunodeficiency virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, influenza virus, and herpes simplex virus have been observed. 10 The mechanism of antiviral action remains to be fully elucidated, but may occur at any of the life cycle stages, including viral adsorption, penetration, or reversetranscription. 10, 11, 13 The niobium-substituted-heteropolytungstates were shown to have potent anti-HIV-1 activity while being minimally cytotoxic. 14 Therefore, we sought to investigate the antiviral effect of a POM Cs 2 K 4 Na[SiW 9 Nb 3 O 40 ]\u00c1H 2 O 1, by using HepG2.2.15 cells, which secrete HBsAg, HBeAg, and complete DNA particles. The results indicate that Compound 1 exhibits strong antiviral activities against the HBV viruses with low cytotoxicity, indicating that it is a potential medicinal candidate against HBV viruses. To date, very few studies of hepatitis B virus treatment by POMs have been reported, yet the potent antiviral activity of these molecules is promising for clinical application. X-ray crystallography has shown that Compound 1 consists of a polyoxoanion [SiW 9 Nb 3 O 40 ] 7\u00c0 , alkali cations, and an isolated water molecule (Table 1 ). In Compound 1, the polyoxoanion [SiW 9 Nb 3 O 40 ] 6\u00c0 exhibits a well-known Keggin structure, which is quite similar to that found in other previously described POMs 14 To determine whether Compound 1 suppressed HBV production by inducing cytotoxicity, HepG2.2.15 cells were exposed to the drug and cellular viability was analyzed by MTT assay. No apparent cytotoxicity was observed for up to 9 days after treatment with Compound 1 at lower concentrations (156.25 and 312.5 lmol/L) (Fig. 2) . This finding suggested that the suppressive activities of Compound 1 on supernatant viral DNA and antigen levels was not a result of induced cytotoxicity. The CC 50 for Compound 1 was determined to be 1747 lmol/L at day nine (Fig. 2) . The corresponding CC 50 for ADV was 1995 lmol/L.",

In particular, these complexes have shown excellent inhibitory activity against human immunodeficiency viruses HIV-1 and HIV-2, herpes simplex virus, and influenza virus. 17 As the POMs are non-toxic to mammalian cells and do not appear to readily induce drug-resistant strains of their target pathogens, they are very promising candidates for development as human therapeutic agents. Research into POMs as small molecule drugs has become so heavily pursued that during our short study period a number of POMs had been synthesized and evaluated for their potential antiviral activity. 12, 18 Our study examined the anti-HBV activities of Compound 1 in vitro. We employed the HepG2.2.15 cell line, a widely used model for the evaluation of anti-HBV drugs, which contains two copies of the HBV genome. 19 Compound 1 elicited a dose-dependent and time-dependent inhibitory effect on the secretion of HBV DNA and the HBsAg and HBeAg antigens after 9 days of treatment. A lower dose of the compound was required to effectively inhibit secreted HBV DNA than to inhibit secreted antigens. The effect of Compound 1 on inhibiting HBV activity in HepG2.2.15 cells was determined to not be a cytotoxic event. It is possible that the compound acts on the exported virions outer protein coats. Though the mechanisms mediating the antiviral effects by Compound 1 remain unclear, we have deduced that Compound 1 might block the secretion of HBV containing nucleocapsids or destabilize HBV DNAcontaining nucleocapsids. 20 We observed that the inhibition rates on HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA were dependent on the concentration of and time of exposure to Compound 1 and ADV. Interestingly, the in vitro anti-HBV properties of Compound 1 against rebound of serum HBV DNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg were more robust than those of ADV, as indicated by evaluation of treated cells 4 days after termination of treatment. This character of sustained activity may have significant clinical implications for Compound 1 and supports further efforts to develop Compound 1 as an anti-HBV drug. Treatment of patients with chronic HBV infection remains an important clinical challenge. As persistent HBV viraemia is strongly associated with development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, complete resolution of the infection is critical. Most of the currently available treatment options, however, can only suppress viral replication. 21 Fortunately, the nucleoside/tide analog-based therapeutics are associated with lower rates of antiviral drug resistance in the long-term and they induce a rapid virologic response. 22 However, there is still a demand for new and improved therapies that will completely clear the HBV infection. The ADV drug competitively inhibits HBV polymerase, which is structurally similar to dATP. It is also known to reduce HBV DNA and HBsAg both in vitro and in vivo by a phosphorylation event that facilitates its physical incorporation into nascent viral DNA by the activity of HBV polymerase during replication. 23 In our study, we observed an apparent reduction in the levels of intracellular HBV intermediates and mRNA in response to Compound 1 treatment. Therefore, it was not surprising that the levels of antigen translated from mRNA, were reduced. 24 The underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which Compound 1 acts on the viral polymerase and processes of protein expression remain unknown and will be elucidated in further investigations.",

Both organic derivatization and metal substitution have extended the number of POMs available. Moreover, POMs-based raw materials are relatively inexpensive and technically simple to generate and amplify; hence, they promise significant economic and technical advantages over the currently available pharmaceuticals. 15, 17, 25 Since the regulatory mechanisms involved in viral replication are quite different from those for the protein expression of HBV antigen, our observations that Compound 1 can inhibit not only the HBV DNA replication and RNA transcription but also the HBV antigen secretion, indicates that there might be at least three targets of Compound 1 antiviral activity.

Each M 3 O 13 consists of three MO6 octahedra linked in a triangular arrangement with shared edges, and the four M 3 O 13 units are linked together by their corners. In the polyoxoanion, there exist three sites with occupancy disorder in the W4, W5, W6 centers; that is, Nb1 and W4, Nb2 and W5, and W6 and Nb3 atoms share the same site with 50% occupancy, respectively, forming the polyoxoanion [SiW 9 Nb 3 O 40 ] 6\u00c0 . The Si-O bond distance is in the range of 1.57(9) to 1.60(6) \u00c5. The W(Nb)-O distances can be grouped into two sets: M-O t (terminal; 1.67(4)-1.71(5) \u00c5), M-O b (bridge; 1.70(7)-2.29(6) \u00c5).",
