Samples were obtained from patients 60 years of age or above who were newly admitted to Sorlandet Hospital Arendal, Norway. The patients were interviewed for current symptoms of a respiratory tract infection. Using rayon swabs and nylon flocked swabs, comparable sets of mucosal samples were harvested from the nasopharynx and the oropharynx. The samples were analysed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. A total of 223 patients (mean age 74.9 years, standard deviation [SD] 9.0 years) were swabbed and a virus was recovered from 11% of the symptomatic patients. Regardless of the sampling site, a calculated 4.8 times higher viral load (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-17, p=0.017) was obtained using the nylon flocked swabs as compared to the rayon swabs. Also, regardless of the type of swab, a calculated 19 times higher viral load was found in the samples from the nasopharynx as compared to the oropharynx (95% CI 5.4-67.4, p<0.001). When swabbing for respiratory viruses in elderly patients, nasopharyngeal rather than oropharyngeal samples should be obtained. Nylon flocked swabs appear to be more efficient than rayon swabs.",

Nasopharyngeal aspirate, which has been considered as a gold standard material for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses in children, has a sensitivity at the level of, or slightly above, nasopharyngeal nylon flocked swabs [14, 15] .

In such cases, suboptimal swabbing may be relatively common. The sample collection in our study was performed by two experienced team members, thus, minimising the risk of suboptimal sampling. Whereas usually, considerable efforts are made to optimise the diagnostic procedures in the laboratory, less emphasis tends to be placed on the preceding procedures of sample collection. We believe that there is a lot to be gained from an increased awareness of proper sampling techniques and sampling tools. For semi-quantitative assessments of respiratory pathogens in children, immunofluorescent assays or viral culture have been widely applied [14, [17] [18] [19] , whereas in the current study, CT values were obtained for this purpose. Most studies applying real-time PCR for the detection of respiratory agents simply determine whether there is an infection or not. However, within each PCR experiment, there is a close relationship between the achieved CT value and the initial amount of specific nucleic acids in the sample. In this study, only samples taken at the same time from the same patient are compared and the CT values used for the calculations are collected from the same experiment. The calculations of differences in viral load relied upon the use of PCR assays with high amplification efficiencies. Factors other than the ones we have been examining are then minimised. In this manner, the method provides valid relative quantitative data when comparing distinct sample materials.",
