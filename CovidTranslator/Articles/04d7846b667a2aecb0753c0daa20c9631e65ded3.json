Examples of the use of tannins for other industrial, nonleather, applications are reported. In particular, this chapter focuses briefl y on their new intended use in the medical and pharmaceutical fi elds. New data on their antiviral effectiveness against a great number of different viruses compared to their higher, lower or absent cytotoxicity are also presented.",

Leather tanning has been used for centuries, millennia in fact, by immersing hides in pits in which tree bark or wood rich in tannin, such as oak, had been left in. This method took up to one full year to produce good leather. However, the actual tannin extraction industry is relatively more recent. It started in Lyon, France and in northern Italy in the 1850s to satisfy the need for black dyes for silk clothes. As the fashion of women silk blouses waned towards the 1870s, the multitude of small chestnut tannin extraction factories that had sprung up underwent a dramatic change of fortune, many going into bankruptcy and closing down, others combining to build enough critical mass to fi nd an alternative use for tannin extract [1] .",

As a consequence, the tannin extraction industry started its second life for an application quite different from the original one. The advantages of tannin extract in leather making, and the timesaving involved by its use, were such that the industry underwent rapid expansion and prospered. The short availability of materials in Europe to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for tannin extracts for leather prompted the opening of factories in far-away countries and the use of new types of tannins. Thus, in the early 1900s, tannin factories using quebracho tannin from South America and Mimosa tannin from Southern and Central Africa started their extraction in industrial quantities and exported them to the main northern hemisphere markets.",

            "text": "The two World Wars gave a considerable impulse to the expansion of tannin extraction, considering that all the armies marched on shoes with leather soles. To give a typical quantitative example, in 1946, just after the end of World War II, a major producer such as South Africa manufactured about 110 000 metric tons of dry tannin extract solids. That year however, was the zenith of the use of vegetable tannins for leather making, because from then on rubber and neoprene soles in everyday shoes, cheaper and readily available, progressively replaced leather counterparts. By the beginning of the 1970s, the total tanning production was down to 72 000 tons per year. This was followed by a further decrease in a period in which hides supply dwindled, due to the decrease and diffi culties of cattle farming in the 1960s and 1970s. Finally, the considerable shift in customers ' tastes in shoes, which came about with the comfortable sport and leisure shoes ' boom ' , gave a fi nal blow to the use of tannins in leather making. It is interesting that today the same country that produced 110 000 tons of tannin extract in 1946, now only produces 42 000, only half of which are still used for leather manufacture.",

            "text": "As a consequence of the steady dwindling in tannin sales for leather, in the 1960s and 1970s the industry started to desperately look for new applications for these natural products. After all, they had survived the collapse of the silk dyes market more than a century earlier, and a new lease of life could perhaps be found in other fi elds. Many applications were tried, from varnish primers for metals, which effectively were in use in Britain for some time during the 1960s and 1970s, to antipollution fl occulating agents that were successful for about 15 years in the 1970s and 1980s, before being superseded by better synthetic materials [18] . About 600 tons tannin per year, are still in use as ore fl otation agents, especially in a couple of feldspar mines in southern Africa [18] . Furthermore, fl uidifying agents for drilling mud and superplasticizing additives for cement were developed [101] . To the best knowledge of the author, about 70-80 tons per year of tannin-based cement additives are still used. The main use found, however, was for tannin adhesives for wood panels and other wood products. Production started in 1973 and reached 4 500 dry tons/year of tannin by 1978, and this fi gure has now risen to around 25 000.",

Worldwide, leather still consumes more tannin than adhesive formulations. This is because oil-derived synthetic adhesives are cheaper than the tannin-based counterparts. The fi rst oil crisis of 1974 at least convinced a few southern hemisphere industrialists (in Australia, South Africa and New Zealand) to use tannin adhesives to avoid the diffi culties of supplying synthetic adhesives. The phenomenon persisted with a couple of still existing exceptions, but it did not take off in Europe or North America. Synthetic adhesives became cheap again and in abundant supply after 1974, being strongly ' pushed ' by all the big chemical companies. Considerable renewed interest in tannins started again after the year 2000 as a result of two factors: (i) the recent marked increase in oil prices that raised disproportionately the market price of all synthetic adhesives, thus favouring natural raw materials. As a consequence, tannin has now become much cheaper than phenol and competes with the cheapest adhesive of them all, urea-formaldehyde resins; (ii) the recent severe tightening of formaldehyde emission regulations, mainly the introduction of the extremely severe Japanese standard, a regulation that is now starting to spill over into other countries [2, 3] .",

Thus, a fourth market transformation has started and it appears set to overtake tannin transformation into wood adhesives, at least in terms of monetary added value. The therapeutic virtues of the addition of tannins in wine (consequence of the so-called French Paradox), the use of tannins to cure some gastrointestinal diseases, the increasing use of tannins as food supplements in North America, and the research on the benefi cial effects of tannins in a multitude of diseases, even serious ones such as cancer and virus-induced sicknesses, are in full swing. This is because the value added to the base cost of tannins is considerable. Indeed, since tannins to be used for human consumption must obviously be thoroughly purifi ed, their price is 40-50 times higher than that of tannins for industrial applications.",

It must be noted fi rst that carbohydrates are intimately and covalently linked to the phenolic moieties in the structure of these tannins, and are therefore to be considered as part of the tannin itself. Indeed, several studies [4, 5] identifi ed the major constituents of the main commercial hydrolysable tannin, chestnut tannin extract (an ellagitannin), as the positional isomers castalagin and vescalagin ( I ), present respectively in 14 The rest of the tannin was found to contain 6.6 per cent of the positional isomers castalin and vescalin ( II ) [4, 5] , 6 per cent of gallic acid, and 3 per cent of pentagalloyl glucose monomer. It must be pointed out however that the authors of the study advancing relative composition percentages [5] clearly state that the disadvantage of the chromatographic technique they used is its strong adsorption of several types of tannins, particularly tannins composed of large molecules. This limitation might well slant the percentages of lower to higher molecular weight components in the analysis of the chestnut extract [4] . Notwithstanding such a limitation, two classes of compounds have however mass predominance in chestnut tannins, namely 28.8 per cent of small molecules, the formula of which is shown in Fig. 1 , and 25.4 per cent (or higher, see reasons above) of an unknown and diffi cult to isolate fraction of apparently a very much higher molecular weight [5] and a very low TLC Rf. This fraction appears to be composed of a number of closely related components giving a continuous TLC smudge of Rf values between 0 and 0.33, which has recently been identifi ed as a mixture of oligomers of pentagalloyl glucose [8] , leading to the hypothesis that castalagin, vescalagin, vescalin and castelin are nothing but the hydrolysis of the real structure of the tannin as present in nature [8] . Circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that their repeat unit is: Although these tannins can be reacted with formaldehyde and other aldehydes, the rates of these interactions are low, and they are therefore not favoured for the preparation of resins. They have, however, been used successfully as partial substitutes (up to 50 per cent) of phenol in the manufacture of phenol-formaldehyde resins [9, 10] . Their chemical behaviour towards formaldehyde is analogous to that of simple phenols of low reactivity and their moderate use as phenol substitutes in the above-mentioned resins does not present diffi culties. Their lack of macromolecular structure, the low level of phenol substitution they allow, their low nucleophilicity, limited worldwide production and relatively high price, somewhat decrease their chemical and economical interest for resin production. Consequently, their main use is for leather tanning where their performance, especially in terms of clarity of colour and light resistance, is truly excellent.",

The reactive positions of the A-rings are the 6 or 8 locations (according to the type of tannin) of all the fl avonoid units, and both of them for the upper terminal fl avonoid units. The A-rings of mimosa and quebracho tannins show reactivity towards formaldehyde comparable to that of resorcinol [11, [14] [15] [16] [17] . Assuming the reactivity of phenol to be 1 and that of resorcinol to be 10, the A-rings have a reactivity of 8-9. However, because of their size and shape, the tannin molecules lose their mobility and fl exibility at a relatively low level of condensation with formaldehyde, so that the available reactive sites are too far apart for further methylene bridge formation. The result may be incomplete polymerization and therefore poor material properties. Bridging agents with longer molecules should be capable of joining the distances that are too long for methylene bridges. Alternatively, other techniques can be used to solve this problem [11, 100] .",

The hydrocolloid gums vary in concentration from 3 to 6 per cent and contribute signifi cantly to the viscosity of the extract despite their low concentration [11, 14] . Similar fl avonoid A-and B-ring patterns also exist in quebracho wood extract ( Schinopsis balansae , and Lorentzii ) [15] [16] [17] , but no phloroglucinol A-ring pattern, or probably a much lower quantity of it, exists in the quebracho extract [17] [18] [19] . Similar patterns to wattle (mimosa) and quebracho are encountered in hemlock and Douglas fi r bark extracts. Completely different patterns and relationships are found instead in pine tannins [20] [21] [22] which present only two main patterns: one represented by fl avonoid analogues based on phloroglucinol A-rings and catechol B-rings [20, 22] and the other, present in a much lower proportion, represented by phloroglucinol A-rings and phenol B-rings [20, 22] .

A brief general and comparative outline of vegetable versus other types of tanning is given here for the information of the reader who might not know this industry. Although the technology of leather manufacture has evolved over centuries, and even in recent years, the basic principles for the production of leather have remained essentially the same. Hide proteins, mainly collagen, are rendered insoluble and dimensionally more stable by treatment with chemical products able to join them and thus render them both more resistant to mechanical wear and less susceptible to biological degradation and other types of attack. The main products used today for leather tanning are (i) acid salts of trivalent chromium, mainly used for the manufacture of soft leathers for shoe uppers and for leather bags; (ii) forestry-derived, natural vegetable tannins, such as chestnut and fl avonoid extracts, mainly used for the manufacture of heavy, rigid and hard leathers for shoe soles, saddles, belts and other implements subject to intensive wear; (iii) aldehydes, in particular formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde; (iv) sulphonated synthetic polymers, such as acid phenol-formaldehyde novolak-type resins and (v) a number of other synthetic resins and compounds (acrylics, oxazolidines, aminoplastic resin, etc.).",

The fact remains however, that the fi rst two in the above list account for more than 90 per cent of all the leather manufactured today, and that the process based on trivalent chromium salts accounts by itself for about 70 per cent of the total. Chrome tanning is particularly suited for soft leather, as it does not affect hide fl exibility and renders the leather very lightfast and very stable both chemically and physically. It produces leather of excellent antishrinkage ability, as indicated by its high shrinkage temperature in testing. The forestry-derived vegetable tannins have, instead, a strong astringent effect (they fi x very effectively on the collagen structure) and give considerable ' body ' , hardness and toughness to the leather produced with them. However, they have the considerable disadvantage of exhibiting marked darkening problems when exposed to light and, even worse, to shrink at a much lower temperature. It is these two main disadvantages that have somewhat limited their application in relation to the ubiquitousness of chromium salts. Conversely, their combination with some synthetic resins such as MUF [29, 30] , give light-coloured leathers presenting high resistance to light-induced degradation, as well as other advantages similar to those of chrome tanning.",

In this respect, two of the requirement limits to comply with are the amount of both leachable trivalent chromium, which generally does not constitute a problem, and of one of its tanning derivatives, namely the more dangerous, highly toxic hexavalent chromium salts. Recent norms [31, 32] limit severely the proportion of these compounds in leathers to be used in direct contact with human skin, such as watch straps, shoe uppers, etc.). Furthermore, the treatment of tanning waste waters represents one of the major problems in the leather industry, especially today that the relevant European Commission norms impose ever more stringent effl uent limits. The waste waters are generally treated to abate (never eliminate) chromium salt residues. However it has proved diffi cult to fi nd suitable alternatives to chromium salts up to now.",

It is the tannin phenolic structure itself which renders photo-oxydation possible [33] , with transformation of tannin phenolic groups to coloured quinones, but it has been shown that this effect can be drastically limited if the tannins are condensed with sulphonated synthetic aminoplast resins such as MUF [29, 30] . Conversely, while the use of synthetic aminoplast resins is developing in the tanning industry, as they give leathers of a certain degree of softness and fl exibility, and particularly suitable for colouring, their weak point is the excessive and inevitable presence of free formaldehyde [34] and their poor tanning capability due to their low astringency. Polyphenolic vegetable tannins are well known to act as powerful free formaldehyde scavengers, as they react rapidly and irreversibly with this compound [11, 35] . Their combination with aminoplast MUF resins thus reduces markedly the photo-oxydation of vegetable tannins through synergy with the synthetic resin, reduces formaldehyde emission to just about zero, yields relatively soft but also tough leather and eliminates the need for chromium salts. Furthermore, such a mix can achieve leather shrinkage temperatures that at least match the chromium salt performance on this parameter.",

Phloroglucinolic A-rings (pine) behave instead as phloroglucinol [37] . Pyrogallol or catechol B-rings are by comparison unreactive and may be activated by anion formation only at relatively high pH [38] . Hence the B-rings do not participate in the reaction except at high pH values (pH 10), where the reactivity towards formaldehyde of the A-rings is so high that the ensuing tannin-formaldehyde adhesives have unacceptably short pot lives [36] . In the usual tannin adhesive practice, only the A-rings are used to generate the network. With regard to the pH dependence of the reaction with formaldehyde, it is generally accepted that the reaction rate of wattle tannins with formaldehyde is the slowest in the pH range 4.0-4.5 [39] ; for pine tannins, the range is between 3.3 and 3.9.",

            "text": "Formaldehyde is generally the aldehyde used in the preparation, setting and curing of tannin-based adhesives. It is normally added to the tannin extract solution at the required pH, preferably in its polymeric form of paraformaldehyde, which is capable of fairly rapid depolymerization under alkaline conditions, and as urea-formalin concentrates. Hexamethylenetetramine (hexamine) may also be added to these resins because of its potential formaldehyde releasing action under heat. Hexamine is, however, unstable in acid media [40] , but becomes more stable with increasing pH values. Hence, under alkaline conditions, the liberation of formaldehyde might not be as rapid and as effi cient as wanted. Also, it has been fairly widely reported, with a few notable exceptions [41] , that bonds formed with hexamine as hardener are not as boil resistant [42] as those formed by paraformaldehyde. The reaction of formaldehyde with tannins may be controlled by the addition of alcohols to the system. Under these circumstances, some of the formaldehyde is stabilized by the formation of hemiacetals ( e.g . CH 2 (OH)(OCH 3 )) if methanol is used [11, 37] . When the adhesive is cured at an elevated temperature, the alcohol is driven off at a fairly constant rate and formaldehyde is progressively released from the hermiacetal. This ensures that less formaldehyde is volatilized when the reactants reach curing the curing temperature and that the pot life of the adhesive is extended. Other aldehydes have also been substituted for formaldehyde [11, 36, 39, 41] .",

It has now been possible to determine by both NMR [42] and particularly by laser desorption mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF), applied to mimosa and quebracho tannins and some of their modifi ed derivatives [12] that: (i) mimosa tannin is predominantly composed of prorobinetinidins, while quebracho is predominantly composed of profi setinidins; (ii) mimosa tannin is heavily branched due to the presence of considerable proportions of ' angular ' units in its structure, while quebracho tannin is almost completely linear [12] . This latter structural difference is the one which contributes to the considerable differences in viscosity of water solutions of the two tannins and which induces the interfl avonoid link of quebracho to be more easily hydrolysable, because of the linear structure of this tannin. This feature confi rms the NMR fi ndings [12, 42] showing that this tannin is subject to polymerization/depolymerization equilibria. The specifi city of the quebracho structure also explains the decrease in viscosity arising from acid/base treatments to yield tannin adhesive intermediates after a certain level of hydrolysis of the tannin itself and not only of the carbohydrates present in the extract (see also Section 8.4). Such a tannin hydrolysis does not appear to occur with mimosa tannin in which the interfl avonoid link is completely stable against this attach.",

Sugars reduce the strength and water resistance in direct proportion to the amount added. Their effect is a mere dilution effect of the adhesive resin solids, with the consequent proportional worsening of adhesive properties. The hydrocolloid gums, instead, have a much more marked effect on both original strength and water resistance of the adhesive [11, 37, 58] . If it is assumed that the nontannins in tannin extracts have a similar infl uence on adhesive properties, it can be expected that unfortifi ed tannin-formaldehyde networks can achieve only 70-80 per cent of the performance shown by synthetic adhesives.",

The possibility of refi ning extracts has proved fruitless largely because the intimate association between the various constituents makes industrial fractionation diffi cult. Fortifi cation is in many cases the most practical approach to reducing the effect of impurities and generally consists of copolymerization of the tannin with phenolic or aminoplastic resins [36, 37, 58, 61] . It can be carried out during the manufacture of the adhesive resin, during gluemix assembly, just before use, or during adhesive use. If added in suffi cient quantity, various synthetic resins have been found effective in reducing the nontannin fraction to below 20 per cent and in overcoming other structural problems [36, 37] . The main resins used are phenol-formaldehyde and urea-formaldehyde resols with a medium-to-high methylol group content. These resins can fulfi l the functions of hardeners, fortifi ers, or both. Generally, they are used as fortifi ers in between 10 and 20 per cent of total adhesive solids, with paraformaldehyde used as a hardener. Such an approach is the favourite one for marine-grade plywood adhesives. These fortifi ers are particularly suitable for the resorcinol types of condensed tannins, such as mimosa. They can be copolymerized with the tannins during resin manufacture, during use, or both [11, [35] [36] [37] 58] . Copolymerization and curing are based on the condensation of the tannin with the methylol groups carried by the synthetic resin. Since tannin molecules are generally large, the rate of molecular growth in relation to the rate of linkage is high, so that tannin adhesives generally tend to have fast gelling and curing times and shorter pot lives than those of synthetic phenolic adhesives. From the point of view of reactivity, phloroglucinol tannins, such as pine tannins, are much faster than mainly resorcinol tannins such as mimosa. The usual ways of slowing them down and, for instance, lengthening the adhesive pot life are:",

When reacted with formaldehyde, unmodifi ed condensed tannins give adhesives having characteristics that do not suit particleboard manufacture, namely, high viscosity, low strength and poor water resistance. The most commonly used process to eliminate these disadvantages in the preparation of tannin-based particleboard adhesives consists of a series of subsequent acid and alkaline treatments of the tannin extract, causing hydrolysis of the gums to simple sugars and some tannin structural changes, thus improving the viscosity, strength and water resistance of the unfortifi ed tannin-formaldehyde adhesive [11, 35] . Furthermore, such treatments may cause the partial rearrangement of the fl avonoid molecules that causes liberation of some resorcinol in situ in the tannin, rendering it more reactive, allowing better crosslinking with formaldehyde and, ultimately, yielding an adhesive which, without addition of any fortifi er resins, gives a truly excellent performance for exterior-grade particleboard [11, 35] .

Pressing times of 7 s mm \u03ea1 of panel thickness have been achieved and of 9 s mm \u03ea1 at 190-200\u00b0C pressing temperatures are in daily operation: these are pressing times that are becoming comparable to those obtainable with urea-formal dehyde or melamine-formaldehyde resins at the same pressing temperatures. The success of these simple types of particleboard adhesives relies heavily on industrial application technologies rather than just on the preparation technology of the adhesive itself [58, 62, 66] . A considerable advantage is the much higher moisture content of the resinated chips tolerable with these adhesives than with any of the synthetic phenolic and aminoresin counterparts. In the case of wood particleboard and of oriented strandboard (OSB) panels, the technology so developed allows hot-pressing at moisture contents of around 24 per cent, against values of 12 per cent for traditional synthetic adhesives, and presents other advantages as well [58, 66, 67] .",

One point that was given close consideration is the deactivating effect of water on the isocyanate group of pMDI. It has been found that the amount of deactivation by water in a concentrated solution (50 per cent or over) of a phenol is much lower than previously thought [68] [69] [70] [71] .

            "text": "The quest to decrease or completely eliminate formaldehyde emission from wood panels bonded with adhesives, although not really necessary in tannin adhesives due to their very low emission (as with most phenolic adhesives), has nonetheless promoted here too some research to further reduce formaldehyde emission. This has centred into two lines of investigation: (i) tannin autocondensation (see paragraph D later on), and (ii) the use of a hardener not emitting at all, simply because no aldehyde has been added to the tannin [72] [73] [74] . Methylolated nitroparaffi ns and, in particular, the simpler and least expensive exponent of their class, namely trishydroxymethyl nitromethane [72, 73] , function well as hardeners for a variety of tannin-based adhesives, while affording considerable side advantages to the adhesive and to the bonded wood joint. In panel products such as particleboard, medium density fi breboard and plywood, the joint performance which is obtained is of the exterior/marine-grade type, combined with a very advantageous and very considerable lengthening in gluemix pot life is obtained. Furthermore, the use of this hardener is coupled with such a marked reduction in formaldehyde emission from the bonded wood panel that it is limited exclusively to the formaldehyde released only by the heated wood, or even less, thus functioning as a mild depressant of emission from the wood itself. Moreover, trishydroxymethyl nitromethane can be mixed in any proportion with traditional formaldehyde-based hardeners for tannin adhesives, its proportional substitution of such hardeners inducing a correspondingly marked decrease in the formaldehyde emission of the wood panel, without affecting its exterior/marine-grade performance. Medium density fi breboard (MDF) industrial plant trials confi rmed all the properties reported above [72, 73] . A cheaper but equally effective alternative to hydroxymethylated nitroparaffi ns is the use of hexamine as tannin hardener. This sometimes causes problems of an early agglomeration in some tannins [74] and a better solution which overcames this drawback was to use a mixture of formaldehyde and an ammonium salt as the hardener.",

This self-condensation reaction is based on the opening under alkaline and acid conditions of the O1\u138fC2 bond of the fl avonoid repeating unit and the subsequent condensation of the reactive centre formed at C2 with the free C6 or C8 sites of a fl avonoid unit on another tannin chain [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] . Although this reaction may lead to considerable increases in viscosity, gelling does not generally occur. However, gelling does occur when the reaction takes place (i) in the presence of small amounts of dissolved silica (silicic acid or silicates) catalyst and some other catalysts [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] , and (ii) on a lignocellulosic surface [89] . In the case of the more reactive procyanidin-and prodelphinidin-type tannins, such as pine tannin, cellulose catalysis is more than enough to cause hardening and to produce boards of strength satisfying the relevant standards for interior-grade panels [89] . In the case of the less reactive tannins, such as mimosa and quebracho, the presence of a dissolved silica or silicate catalyst is essential to achieve the panel strength required by the relevant standards. Self-condensation reactions have been shown to contribute considerably to the dry strength of wood panels bonded with tannins, but to be relatively inconsequential in contributing to the bonded-panel exteriorgrade properties, which are instead attained by polycondensation reactions with aldehydes [89] [90] [91] . Combinations of tannin self-condensation and reactions with aldehydes, and combinations of radical and ionic reaction, have been used to decrease the proportion of aldehyde hardener needed, as well as to decrease considerably further the already low formaldehyde emission caused by the use of tannin adhesives [89] [90] [91] .",

Superplasticizers are, instead, substances that in small amounts are able to strongly fl uidify a cement mix without retarding its setting. Heavily sulphonated melamine-formaldehyde resins are the only other superplasticizers known in cement technology, other than tannins. This enhanced workability without any addition of extra water entails neither a loss of fi nal strength, nor any gross retardation of concrete strength. Furthermore, no decrease in initial strength is observed.

The combination of electrostatic repulsion and large ionic size brings about a rapid dispersion of the individual cement grains. In doing so, water trapped within the original fl ocks is released and can contribute to the mobility of the cement paste and, hence, to the workability of the concrete. Superplasticizers do not cause much reduction in the surface tension of water. The adsorption of the anions on the surface of the cement grain is also less tenacious than in the case of retarders and the course of the hydration reaction is not hindered at normal dosage levels. It follows that, for normal superplasticizers, there is no signifi cant retardation of setting and hardening.",

            "text": "Tannins are well known to have an antimicrobial activity. This is logical as their capability to tan proteins means that they will complex irreversibly also with the proteins in bacterial membranes, thus inhibiting any activity they might have. It follows that, pharmaceuticals containing tannins and aimed at curing bacterial intestinal infections have been around already for some time. Some studies on their anticavity effectiveness have also been conducted [94] . Additionally, the use of tannins in other pharmaceutical medical applications, have been reported, particularly concerning their antitumour and anticancer activity [95] [96] [97] [98] . More recently, work on their antiviral effectiveness has been conducted [99] . The data in Tables 4 to 11 present preliminary results obtained on the antiviral activity of 12 different fl avonoid and hydrolysable tannins, obtained at the medical department of Leuven University [99] . These results evaluated both the effectiveness of 12 different tannins, as measured by the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity by 50 per cent. The lower the MIC value, the better the compound as an antiviral substance. Equally important, the results in the tables report the Minimum Cytotoxic Concentration (MCC) required to cause a microscopically detectable alteration in the normal cell morphology. The higher the MCC, the less toxic is the compound to the patient ' s cells and the better it is as an antiviral substance. Thus, what is sought is the lowest possible MIC and the highest possible MCC. These results were obtained as in vitro screening tests, which implies that in vivo conformations are required. Nonetheless, their novelty and thoroughness justify their full report here. Different tannins have been shown to be very effective against different viruses, the nature of the different polyphenolic groups being the cause of this behaviour. Most likely, they tan the proteins and associate with the carbohydrates of the virus membrane, through an interaction similar to that associating them with hide proteins and carbohydrates to give leather.
