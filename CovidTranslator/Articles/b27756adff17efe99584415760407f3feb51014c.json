During September 2014-January 2015, an outbreak of 38 cases of MERS was reported from 4 healthcare facilities in Taif, Saudi Arabia; 21 of the 38 case-patients died. Clinical and public health records showed that 13 patients were healthcare personnel (HCP). Fifteen patients, including 4 HCP, were associated with 1 dialysis unit. Three additional HCP in this dialysis unit had serologic evidence of MERS-CoV infection. Viral RNA was amplified from acute-phase serum specimens of 15 patients, and full spike gene-coding sequencing was obtained from 10 patients who formed a discrete cluster; sequences from specimens of 9 patients were closely related. Similar gene sequences among patients unlinked by time or location suggest unrecognized viral transmission. Circulation persisted in multiple healthcare settings over an extended period, underscoring the importance of strengthening MERS-CoV surveillance and infection-control practices.",

Since the virus was first identified 2012, more than 85% of cases have occurred in Saudi Arabia (1) . Although risk factors for transmission have not been well described, camels (Camelus dromedarius) are suspected reservoirs, as suggested by case investigations (2, 3) , serologic studies (4, 5) , and isola-tion of live infectious MERS-CoV (2, 3, 6) . Limited humanto-human transmission has been documented in households (7) and healthcare facilities (8) (9) (10) , but no sustained community transmission has been documented (1) . In Jeddah in 2014, secondary transmission (i.e., from infected to noninfected persons) accounted for 97% of assessed cases (9) .",

In addition to standardized data collection, viral sequencing should be attempted when possible to enable better understanding of transmission events. Our investigation shows the highly infectious nature of MERS-CoV, including high rates of illness and death from within dialysis settings, as previously noted (8, 9) . In hospital B's dialysis unit, 15 persons had MERS-CoV infections confirmed by rRT-PCR during a 3-week period. Eleven of the 15 were non-HCP patients who were regularly undergoing dialysis, and 8 (73%) died. The other 4 were HCP, 3 of whom were symptomatic. Our subsequent serologic investigation of HCP in the dialysis unit identified 3 additional and previously unrecognized HCP who were seropositive but denied symptoms at interview (online Technical Appendix). A total of 18 persons were involved in the dialysis unit transmission event. Although this investigation did not firmly establish modes of transmission, risk for respiratory droplet transmission in this setting might have been increased because of close spacing (<2 meters between beds) of patients who also were likely to be immunocompromised by end-stage renal disease and other underlying conditions such as diabetes.

Our team had limited access to hospital A, although we were able to assess case reporting and investigation forms, discuss patients with providers, and receive patient specimens for further laboratory testing. This outbreak occurred among at least 4 facilities, and contact investigations were conducted by those facilities. Although the contact investigations were critical for detecting mildly ill patients in this outbreak, contact tracing and testing might not have been uniformly conducted in all facilities, potentially limiting the scope of our investigation. Although we were able to obtain partial MERS-CoV genome sequences from acute-phase serum samples from 10 of 12 patients, specimens were not available for all patients. Additional viral sequences from the unlinked cases would have been particularly useful in understanding whether these cases were possibly linked to the identified facility transmission events. The limited availability of specimens restricted our ability to obtain full-genome sequences that would likely provide greater epidemiologic power in resolving transmission events. Although we attempted to link the results of our epidemiologic investigation with the spike gene sequences from investigated cases, we cannot be certain whether the virus was introduced into the healthcare environment in Taif on one or multiple occasions. Circulation of MERS-CoV among camels in Taif has been documented (19) , and the detection of phylogenetically common or closely related viruses in the human cases in this investigation might reflect multiple introductions of the same or similar viruses circulating in camels in Taif during this outbreak period.
