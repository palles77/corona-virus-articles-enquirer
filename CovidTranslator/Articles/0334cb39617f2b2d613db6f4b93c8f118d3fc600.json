            "text": "Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in swine. As PCV2 displays significant homology with PCV1 (a non-pathogenic virus) at the nucleotide and amino-acid level, a discriminative antigen is needed for specific serological diagnosis. The ORF2-encoded capsid protein from PCV2 was used to develop an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). GST-fused capsid protein from PCV2 and GST alone (both expressed in recombinant baculovirus-infected cells) were used as antigens for serodiagnosis. The specificity of the ELISA for detection of PCV2 antibodies was demonstrated in sera from pigs experimentally infected with PCV1, PCV2 and other swine viruses. The semi-quantitative nature of the test was evaluated versus an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). The ELISA was performed on 322 sera from pigs in eight Brittany herds and compared with IPMA. The sensitivity (98.2%) and specificity (94.5%) of this test were considered suitable for individual serological detection. High PCV2 seroprevalence was found in sows and pigs at the end of the growth phase (18-19 weeks) in all eight herds. The seroprevalence in piglets (11-17 weeks) was statistically correlated with clinical symptoms of PMWS (93% in affected versus 54%, in non-affected farms). A cohort study performed in PMWS-free farms showed that 57% of piglets exhibited active seroconversion",

Although experimental infection tests indicated that PCV1 was non-pathogenic (Tischer et al., 1986; Allan et al., 1995) , serological surveys revealed a high prevalence of PCV1 antibodies in the swine population (Hines and Lukert, 1995; Tischer et al., 1995) . Significant cross-reactivity between PCV1 and PCV2 antigens was demonstrated, but serological evaluation based on PCV1 alone underestimated the seroprevalence of PCV2 (Magar et al., 2000; Rodriguez-Arrioja et al., 2000) . Thus, specific tools for serologic detection are essential to determine the prevalence of PCV2 infection and elucidate how PMWS develops. Testing for PCV2 antibodies in sera is now performed by indirect immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescence staining of PCV2-infected cell cultures (Balasch et al., 1999; Ellis et al., 1999) . These tests are not PCV2-specific because of slight antigenic cross-reactivity between PCV2 and PCV1. Other tests recently developed with PCV2-specific monoclonal antibodies (Sala et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2000) use the PCV2 virus and involve specific preparation of the antigen. However, PCV2 is difficult to produce on cells, requiring treatment with d-glucosamine and successive passages of the cells.",

The present study used whole capsid protein for specific, sensitive serodiagnosis of PCV2 infection. An ORF2-based ELISA was developed using GST-fused antigen as well as GST alone, both of which are expressed in recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells. The specificity of this test was evaluated using PCV1 and PCV2 antisera as well as other antisera from different swine viruses. Diagnostic sensitivity (DSn) and specificity (DSp) were compared in this ELISA and an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA), using 322 sera from pigs of Brittany herds. Investigations of the current state of PCV2 seroprevalence in swine indicated that the percentages of PCV2 antibodies in different age categories from PMWS-affected or PMWS-free herds constituted a possible epidemiological indicator relative to the clinical symptoms of PMWS.",

In addition, ELISA results were obtained for 322 serum samples from the transverse serological study described below. The results for four herds (two with and two without clinical symptoms of PMWS) were compared with those obtained by the IPMA reference method (serum sample diluted 1:100), as indicated above. The diagnostic sensitivity (DSn) and specificity (DSp) of the ELISA test were determined using the following formulae: DSn = TP/(TP + FN) \u00d7 100, where TP is the true-positive and FN the false-negative; and DSp = TN/(TN + FP) \u00d7 100, where TN is the true-negative and FP the false-positive.",

As PCV2 is associated with PMWS, PCV2-specific diagnostic tools are necessary to elucidate the course of infection. To date, most serological studies have used PCV viral particles for detection of PCV2 infection. PCV2 antibodies are currently detected by indirect immunofluorescent or immunoperoxidase assays after PCV infection of culture cells, and serotyping is achieved by comparative analysis of the titers obtained in PCV2and PCV1-infected cells (Labarque et al., 2000; Magar et al., 2000; Rodriguez-Arrioja et al., 2000) . However, such assays are not only time-consuming, but also lack PCV2 specificity, owing to antigenic cross-reactivity between Rep proteins of the two strains. More recently, PCV2 viral particles in combination with specific PCV2 monoclonal antibodies were used to develop a competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) for specific detection of PCV2 antibodies (Walker et al., 2000; Sala et al., 2000) . However this c-ELISA still required culturing of PCV-infected cells. An interesting feature of the indirect protein-based ELISA proposed in the present study is that the baculovirus expression system used for antigen production allows high yields.",

            "text": "PCV2 serological analysis conducted in eight breeding-fattening farms in Brittany showed that almost all sows and finishing-fattening pigs were seropositive, irrespective of the presence or absence of clinical signs of PMWS. These results are concordant with those obtained in Belgium, Spain, the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, Canada and the USA. However, high PCV2 seroprevalence was observed at the beginning of fattening (11-13 weeks) and during fattening (16-17 weeks) in PMWS-affected herds (96 and 90%, respectively), as compared to more moderate seroprevalence for both categories in PMWS-free herds (53 and 54%, respectively). These observations were corroborated by analysis of the mean OD ratio for each category, which revealed a statistically significant difference, depending on the presence or absence of clinical symptoms (P < 0.001), in pigs in the 11-13and 16-17-week categories. These results strongly suggests that PCV2 infection appears in PMWS-free farms during the fattening phase, whereas that observed in affected farms appears during the post-weaning phase. Active PCV2 seroconversion seems to occur later in PMWS-free farms than in PMWS-affected farms. It is noteworthy that the results for one of the four PMWS-free farms gave a different profile, showing only slight seroprevalence for the 16-17-week category. This would seem to indicate that the period of passive immunity was longer in this herd. Other experimental works indicated that passive immunity can last up to 14 weeks (data not shown).",

Thirty-five percent of the animals exhibited active seroconversion at 13 weeks and 57% at 18 weeks, whereas 8% showed a decline in PCV2 antibodies up to 18 weeks. The results are totally corroborated by those of the transverse study. PCV2 seroprevalence was slight in the transverse study between 11 and 17 weeks, whereas the cohort study showed major active seroconversion at 18 weeks. No pigs seroconverted at 10 weeks. Thus, these two studies suggest that PCV2 infection appears later in pigs with no PMWS history, whereas infection develops early in PMWS-affected pigs. These results emphasize the importance of the period of passive immunity, which was apparently longer on PMWS-free farms and probably resulted in a later onset of PCV2 infection. These pigs would be more resistant to PCV2 and therefore less likely to show clinical signs of PMWS.",
