The present study reports an unusual case of C. krusei pneumonia that was initially suspected to be a Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) case. A 64-year-old Saudi Arabian male patient was admitted to our hospital with complaints of cough and dyspnea that persisted for 6 days. The patient presented fever (oral temperature, 38.5\u02daC) and slight tachypnea (25 respirations/min). A chest computerized tomography demonstrated unclear lung fields, diffuse pathological changes in the two lungs and multiple lymphadenectasis in the retrocaval and para-aortic arch area. The patient received 95-98% oxygen (6 l/min) for 24 h, as well as sulbactam sodium/cefoperazone sodium (1:1) injection (3.0 g) every 12 h, oral oseltamivir capsules (75 mg/time) twice a day, medaron injection (80 mg/time) and 750 ml fluid infusion; however, he succumbed to the disease on day 2 after admission. The infection was diagnosed by sputum smear and culture subsequent to patient mortality. A sputum smear showed a large fungal infection and sputum culture revealed the presence of C. krusei infection. Serum procalcitonin concentrations were 4.73 \u00b5g/l and 7.23 \u00b5g/l on days 2 and 3 after admission, respectively. In conclusion, the diagnosis of Candida pneumonia should be strongly considered in the presence of growth of Candida from a sputum culture and based on a suggestive computed tomography image. Tumescent diaphragmatic lymph nodes may also be an important symptom of Candida pneumonia. Treatment should be initiated immediately to improve tissue oxygenation, restore cardiovascular function and improve other organ functions.",

It occurs predominantly in immunocompromised patients, or patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (4). Haron et al (5) revealed an incidence of 0.4% among 7,725 patients (1) , which is similar to Masur's observations several years before (0.23%). Candida pneumonia was first described by Nils Ros\u00e9n von Rosenstein in 1984 (6) , and later reported by Castellani in 1927 (7) . However, only a limited number of cases have since been reported in the English literature (8) . In search of the PubMed database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed accessed 14 May, 2009), 91 cases of Candida pneumonia confirmed by histopathology (1) (2) (3) (8) (9) (10) were identified. In particular, Candida krusei (C. krusei) infection is less frequently encountered in clinical mycology compared with other species of Candida pathogens, with the first case of C. krusei infection reported in 2002 (3, 11) .",

Other physical examinations included the abdominal bulge in the absence of tenderness and rebound, unsatisfactory palpation of liver and spleen, borborygmus at a rate of 4/min with negative shifting dullness, as well as mild edema of the lower limbs. Neurogenic examination showed no abnormalities. The admitting diagnosis was severe pneumonia due to suspected MERS, respiratory and heart failure, acid base imbalance and electrolyte disturbances, diabetes, chronic kidney insufficiency and hypertension.",

All repeat blood culture sets did not yield any growth. Diagnosis of numerous viruses by nucleic acid detection was also negative at 2 days after admission, including absence of infection with MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), flu viruses of type A and B (including the H1N1 and H7N9 subtypes of inf luenza A), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, respiratory adenovirus, respiratory syncytial viruses and various parainfluenza viruses (types I, II and III). In addition, galactomannan (GM) detection in the blood was negative. A sputum smear showed a preliminary result of fungal infection, and the culture was repeated three times, indicating a positive result for C. krusei infection 4 days after admission. Therefore, the diagnosis of C. krusei pneumonia was established, but specific treatment for C. krusei was not administered due to the patient succumbing to the disease 2 days after admission. Initially, the patient was isolated and received 95-98% oxygen at atmospheric pressure at a rate of 6 l/min through a nasal catheter for 24 h after admission to the hospital. Due to the history of diabetes, a poor therapeutic effect for community infection, an auxiliary and radiological examination, the patient was administered sulbactam sodium/cefoperazone sodium (1:1) by injection (3.0 g/time, which is the total dose used for injection; Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Liaoning, China) every 12 h for antibacterial infection treatment before the definite diagnosis. Oral administration of oseltamivir capsules (75 mg/time; Roche, Bale, Switzerland) was performed twice a day for antiviral infection treatment. Intravenous administration of medaron (Pfizer Manufacturing Belgium NV, Puurs, Belgium) at a dose of 80 mg/time was also started empirically for anti-inflammatory treatment, as well as 750 ml fluid infusion. However, no significant improvement was noted, and the condition of the patient deteriorated, with cardiac and respiratory arrest occurring one day after admission. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was immediately performed, and the patient recovered weak respiration with an assisted respirator. The BP of the patient at this time was 70/50 mmHg, which was raised and stabilized at 110/80 mmHg after adjusting the speed of fluid infusion, monitoring central venous pressure, and minipump infusion (4-20 ml/h, adjusted according to the BP) of vasoactive agents, including noradrenaline (10 mg) and normal saline (50 ml). Furthermore, a low HR of 30-40 beats/min was recorded and thus cardiotonic therapy was administered, which consisted of adrenalin injection (10 mg) and normal saline (50 ml) at a minipump maintenance dose of 4-20 ml/h (adjusted according to the BP and HR). Furthermore, the renal function of the patient was aggravated, with the appearance of oliguria and anuresis. In spite of continuing renal replacement therapy, the patient succumbed to the infection 2 days after admission.",
