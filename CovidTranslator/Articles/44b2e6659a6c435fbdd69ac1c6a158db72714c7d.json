We investigated the etiology by the culture of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, urine antigen testing of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumoniae, and DNA or RNA determination of eight kinds of respiratory virus DNA or RNA. An etiological diagnosis was made in 51.8% of 197 patients. The most common pathogens were M. pneumoniae (29.4%) followed by influenza virus A, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (9.6%), and S. pneumoniae (4.1%). Patients with mycoplasma infections were younger, less likely to have comorbidities, Drs. Bin Cao, Li-Li Ren, and Fei Zhao contributed equally to this paper.",

Among patients infected with M. pneumoniae, those with quinolones as initial prescriptions had shorter duration of fever after the initiation of antibiotics than patients with \u03b2-lactams, macrolides, or \u03b2lactams + macrolides (p<0.05). This study suggests that M. pneumoniae and respiratory viruses were the most frequent pathogens found in ambulatory adult CAP patients and quinolones were better than \u03b2-lactams, macrolides, or \u03b2lactams + macrolides in the resolution of fever of M. pneumoniae pneumonia.",

Fifty to eighty percent of patients with CAP are treated on an ambulatory basis [2] . However, most of our knowledge about the clinical manifestations and outcomes of CAP comes from studies among patients requiring admission to the hospital and CAP management guidelines have been influenced by these CAP etiology studies [3, 4] . Currently available evidence from randomized-controlled trials (RCT) scanning is insufficient to make evidence-based recommendations for the choice of antibiotic for the treatment of CAP in ambulatory patients [5] . Although CAP guidelines acknowledge respiratory viruses as a 'cause' of pneumonia, few recommendations are made regarding the management of viral pneumonia.",

None of the patients were immuno-compromised: patients with HIV infection, neutropenia, or who were receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy were excluded. In addition, patients from nursing homes or patients who had been admitted to a hospital within the last 30 days were also excluded. After the first clinic encounter, all patients were followed-up by telephone within 7 to 28 days. Symptoms and signs were recorded daily. All patients suspected to have CAP had a chest X-ray (CXR). Only one patient had a normal CXR but a positive computed tomography (CT) scan. The pneumonia severity index (PSI) was used to assess the severity of illness [6] . Throat swabs were collected for Mycoplasma pneumoniae culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay [7] . Sputum and throat swabs were screened for the presence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IFV) A, B, and C, parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1-4, human rhinoviruses (HRVs), enterovirus (EV), human coronavirus (HCoV 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and adenovirus (AdV), as previously reported [8, 9] . The microbial etiology was classified as 'definitive', 'presumptive', or 'unknown'. Bacteria were considered to be definitive causative agents when isolated from blood or pleural fluid cultures. If M. pneumoniae was isolated, it was considered to be a definitive pathogen. Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae were considered to be a definite agent when the urinary antigen test was positive. The bacterial pathogen was considered to be 'presumptive' if a respiratory pathogen was isolated from purulent sputum (defined as an adequate quality sputum sample with >25 leukocytes and <10 epithelial cells per\u00d7100 magnification field). The presence of nucleic acids of M. pneumoniae and respiratory viruses from sputum or throat swabs by molecular methods was considered to be 'presumptive'. Comparisons of clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes were conducted between patients with known causative pathogens and without, using an unpaired Student's t-test, the Mann-Whitney test, or the Chi-square test (SPSS for Windows 13.0).",

Overall, the median age of the patients was 32.5 years (range, 14 to 89 years), 49.7% were male, and 95.2% had mild CAP (PSI<90). A microbiological diagnosis was established in 102 patients (51.8%). The most common pathogens were M. pneumoniae (29.4%), followed by respiratory viruses (9.6%) and S. pneumoniae (4.1%). Influenza virus A (IFVA) was the most common respiratory virus identified (6.1%), followed by parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (AdV), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). The presence of two or three pathogens was detected in ten outpatients (5.1%). Five patients had co-infections with M. pneumoniae and respiratory virus; four had co-infections with bacteria and virus. One patient had three pathogens: Haemophilus influenzae, M. pneumoniae, and IFVA. Two (1%) of them were diagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis by the positive culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from sputum ( Table 1) . None of the patients were tested positive for L. pneumoniae by urine antigen testing. Urinary antigen testing was positive for S. pneumoniae in four patients (two sputum and one blood culture positive for S. pneumoniae, the other was sputum culture negative).",

We also found that the clinical features and outcomes of viral CAP were comparable to bacterial and atypical bacterial pathogens, except that patients with viral infections were older and more likely to have poorly defined nodules on CXR or CT scan ( Table 2) . It is the well-accepted standard that every CAP patient should receive an antibacterial agent [3, 4] . Based on the findings, we suggest that, if no bacteria or atypical pathogens are detected, antibacterial agents should not be routinely given. More clinical trials are indicated to confirm our suggestion and to select a targeted patient population in whom antibacterial agents can be safely withheld.",

In older CAP clinical evaluation studies, efficacy was usually defined as the composite endpoint of clinical cure, pneumonia-associated complications, and mortality [14] . But for ambulatory CAP patients, the total duration of fever is only 4-6 days, and there are no pneumonia-associated complications or death [15] . To evaluate the outcomes for the various pathogens, we used the surrogate endpoints of the rapidity of the resolution of clinical manifestations of pneumonia (fever and respiratory tract symptoms). We found that, although patients with CAP caused by M. pneumoniae had less severe illness (as measured by the PSI), they had longer duration of fever than patients infected by the common bacterial pathogens. For bacterial pneumonia, the clinical outcome was comparable in patients treated with \u03b2-lactams and/or macrolides and respiratory quinolones. But, for M. pneumoniae, quinolones appeared to have superior efficacy compared to \u03b2-lactams for the resolution of fever ( Table 3 ). The trend in favor of quinolones in the treatment of CAP caused by M. pneumoniae can be explained by the high prevalence of macrolide resistance in M. pneumoniae isolates from adult and adolescent patients with respiratory tract infections [16] .",
