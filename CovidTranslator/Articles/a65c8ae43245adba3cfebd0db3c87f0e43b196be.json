For this purpose, we have been constructing a knowledge base by organizing various experimental and computational observations as a collection of if-then rules. Here we report an expert system, which utilizes this knowledge base, for predicting localization sites of proteins only from the information on the amino acid sequence and the source origin. We collected data for 401 eukaryotic proteins with known localization sites (subcellular and extracellular) and divided them into training data and testing data. Fourteen localization sites were distinguished for animal cells and 17 for plant cells. When sorting signals were not well characterized experimentally, various sequence features were computationally derived from the training data. It was found that 66% of the training data and 59% of the testing data were correctly predicted by our expert system. This artificial intelligence approach is powerful and flexible enough to be used in genome analyses.",

            "text": "In eukaryotic cells, the sorting signals that direct proteins to proper subcellular locations are usually encoded in their own amino acid sequences. A growing body of experimental evidence has been clarifying the nature of these signals. There are multiple ways of representing such empirical knowledge for computer processing. A production system utilizes a knowledge base constructed as a collection of \"if-then\" rules. It is relatively easy to implement knowledge in this manner, and a number of expert systems are of this type. In our previous work, we constructed an expert system for predicting protein localization sites in Gram-negative bacteria by organizing the relationships between amino acid sequence features and functional aspects in the form of if-then rules (Nakai and Kanehisa, 1991 ). The expert system could discriminate 106 proteins in our database into four localization sites with 83% accuracy. In the present work, our previous system is expanded so that it can also predict the localization sites of eukaryotic proteins, incorporating knowledge of a variety of sorting signals (Verner and Schatz, 1988) . This is a first attempt to systematically allocate various protein localization sites in eukaryotic cells from a theoretical point of view, which requires consideration of the following. First, because protein-sorting signals are mutually related, it does not seem sufficient to examine each feature separately. Second, because of the variations in how such features are encoded, it is not possible to treat all signals uniformly, say, by a single discriminant function. Third, because of the difficulty of interpreting the functional data mentioned above, any theory should make experimentally testable predictions and be able to evolve as new insights are gained. A knowledgebased approach is suitable for solving problems in these circumstances. ",

The core of our system is written in the programming language OPS83, version 3.0 (Forgy, 1989) . The knowledge base is divided into three modules, corresponding to the order of reasoning steps. In the first module, rules are organized for classifying organism names into one of the five categories: Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, yeast, animal, or plant. The second and third modules contain rules for sorting signals, the second containing general rules and the third containing more specialized rules. This distinction is somewhat arbitrary, but the reasoning with more specialized rules is performed after the general reasoning step. The calculations involving sequence data are written in C language and are called from rules when necessary. The flow of reasoning occurs in a backward fashion; each localization site of the repertoire is activated one by one as a hypothesis and the rules for examining sequence characteristics for each localization site are invoked to verify the hypothesis. Thus, given the amino acid sequence and the organism name, our expert system reports a list of probable localization sites with certainty factors.",

Occasionally, we use the method called stepwise discriminant analysis Kanehisa, 1988, 1991) for deriving an optimal combination of various sequence features. Suppose, for example, proteins sorted to a certain localization site have amino acid compositions different from those of proteins sorted to another site. Using 20 amino acid contents as variables, the stepwise discriminant analysis determines the set of coefficients that maximally discriminates the two groups. The derived discriminant function is represented by the formula y = ~ alx i + const, i where x i is the variables to be selected (say, 20 amino acid contents) and as and const are the coefficients. When used for prediction, each unknown sequence is classified into one of the two groups according to the sign of this function. To avoid excessive dependence on training data, the stepwise procedure is usually not repeated until all 20 coefficients are determined.

There were two more examples of the bipartite signal in our inner membrane protein data.

Despite this treatment, it was difficult to locate precisely all transmembrane segments in polytopic proteins, such as the seven transmembrane segments in the rhodopsin family. However, the number of predicted segments was close to that of most models of available polytopic proteins.",

The topology of L-gulonolactone oxidase (OXRTGU) is not well studied. If it has a type II topology, as predicted from the charge difference, then it is an unusual protein whose transmembrahe segment resides near the center of the sequence. A similar feature can be observed in the type Ib topology of a plasma membrane protein, glycophorin C (GFHUC). We represented these observations as hypothetical rules (rules 'er5' and 'pm4'). In addition, cytochrome b5 (S03373) is an exceptional protein whose hydrophobic segment may not transverse the membrane (Holloway and Buchheit, 1990) . As for type III proteins, we could not find any prominent sequence features that could be used to predict their localization sites, partly because of the difficulty of precisely allocating transmembrane segments; type III proteins with more than three predicted segments were tentatively predicted to be plasma membrane proteins (rule 'pm5').

Although two Golgi proteins were selected with no false positives, two other Golgi proteins satisfying this condition failed because their N-terminal transmembrane segment was predicted to be cleaved.

First, we predicted the membrane topology of a protein; then, if it was a type Ia protein and if it contained a GY motif in the cytoplasmic tail within 17 residues of the boundary with the membrane, it was predicted to be a lysosomal membrane protein (rule 'lys2'). This procedure was sufficient for discriminating the three proteins from all the training data. Interestingly, they were also positive in the discriminant score for lysosomal soluble proteins.

It is likely that most plant and yeast cells have a common sorting pathway for vacuolar proteins, though they may have other diverse pathways. Some vacuolar proteins have their signals in the preregion, which essentially looks like an ER-transferon, and the proregion, which is needed for specific recognition at the Golgi complex. However, no common sequence leatures have been discovered in the latter. In addition, there is a protein that does not use even the secretory pathway (Yoshihisa and Anraku, 1990) , as well as a membrane protein that uses a distinct pathway (Klionsky and Emr, 1990) . We performed a discriminant analysis between vacuolar and extracellular proteins from the amino acid composition of the sequence excluding the preregion (rule 'vacl' and 'vac2'), as shown in Table 3d . The vacuolar sequences that do not have an ER-transferon at the N-terminus were excluded from the analysis because they seemed to have distinct characteristics. Indeed, they could not be correctly discriminated by the derived function. The selected variables were totally different from the ones selected in the analysis of lysosomal proteins. With only a single amino acid content (K), 12 of 13 lysosomal and vacuolar proteins could be correctly distinguished (data not shown), although in our expert system the distinction is made by the organism name.",

We postulated that all stromal proteins and thylakoid membrane proteins have the same kind of stroma-targeting signal (S-transferon; Hand et al., 1989; Keegstra et al., 1989) and searched for an efficient method of detecting it. Based on the observation that S-transferons have three distinct regions (von Heijne et al., 1989) , we performed a stepwise discriminant analysis using as variables the amino acid compositions of the two N-terminal segments, residues 3 to 10 and residues 1 to 30, and the position and the amplitude of maximum hydrophobic moment of 165 \u00b0 for residues 25 to 70 (rule 'chts0'). As shown in Table 3e , the result of self-discrimination was rather good. In contrast, the loosely conserved motif (V/I)X(A/C)A of S-degrons (Gavel and von Heijne, 1990a) was not as effective.

These proteins showed positive scores with the discriminant function for Stransferons. To detect the latter half of the bipartite signal, we employed two methods. One was the weight ma-trix of Howe and Wallace (1990) (rule 'ch2nd2'), which was derived from the data of thylakoid luminal proteins by the same method as von Heijne's (1986) . The weight matrix could locate all the cleavage sites of our data, but it was not sufficient for discriminating thylakoid luminal proteins from others. It is probable that the weight matrix could only detect the signal recognized by a specific protease and could not detect the S/T-transferon itself. The second method we used was the 'apolar' algorithm applied to the limited region of residues 40 to 90 (rule 'ch2ndl'). From the 'apolar' score and the length of the apolar region, most thylakoid luminal proteins could be discriminated from other chloroplast proteins.",

The number of rules is currently 80, excluding those for bacterial sequences. A simplified reasoning tree is given in Fig. 3 . For each possible site, the reasoning procedure is performed roughly following the tree. Each node is a checkpoint for a certain sequence feature and certainty factors are modified according to its result. In principle, the path of reasoning should follow the real pathway of sorting in vivo. It is most probable that the first recognition process for a nascent polypeptide is mediated by an ER-transferon. If the polypeptide has an ER-transferon, it will be committed to a vesicle-mediated pathway and its final localization site will be determined by its comparton signals. Otherwise, it will be sorted according to other transferon signals. If it has no signals at all, it will become a cytoplasmic protein.",

One was the treatment of internal ER-transferons, which cannot be effectively detected at present. For example, since most plasma membrane proteins do not have N-terminal ERtransferons, they must be examined in the context of the cytoplasmic pathway. Another was the independence of evaluations. As described, the possibility of being sorted to each localization site is evaluated one by one. In general, different evaluations are independent except for those for cytoplasmic proteins. Finding that one protein is unlikely to be sorted to one site does not usually raise the possibility that it may be sorted to any other specific site. The calculated possibilities are stored as certainty factors and the site that has the highest certainty is selected as the most probable site. However, we had to break this principle for some localization sites with poorly characterized sorting signals (e.g., nuclei and lysosomes), making the evaluation order-dependent, i.e., well-characterized sites first.",

It is difficult to compare this prediction accuracy to other standards, but since each protein has a possibility of 14 to 17 localization sites depending on the organism, a random guess would result in less than 10% accuracy. If we simply assume that all proteins in the testing data belong to the largest site, the extracellular space, the value is 21%.

A significant decrease in the predictability was observed for the stroma of chloroplasts, the matrix of mitochondria, and the peroxisomes, all of which were largely dependent on the results of discriminant analysis, which apparently had the danger of overfitting to the training data. The fine structure of organelles, such as the mitochondrial inner membrane, was relatively difficult to predict.

The prediction accuracy for the combined mitochondrial proteins becomes 64% in the testing data. Table 5 also contains the number of false positives for each site.

Our system turned out to be flexible enough to incorporate diverse types of sorting signals and could contain ambiguous observations and working hypotheses. Furthermore, its performance could be evaluated by the predictability applied to unknown sequences. There are, however, still problems to be overcome, especially in knowledge acquisition and maintenance.

There are many proteins whose localization sites are not confined to a single space. For example, some proteins like NF-KB change their localization sites in a regulated manner (Hunt, 1989) . Ribosomal proteins are first sorted from the cytoplasm to the nucleus according to their Nu-transferons, but after their assembly they are transported back to the cytoplasm possibly by a specific mechanism (Underwood and Fried, 1990) . We defined ribosomal proteins as nuclear proteins. Future progress in understanding these mechanisms may enable us to make a more detailed prediction of multiple localization sites. Another difficulty was the presence of nonconservative and specific sorting pathways. Some extracellular proteins such A simplified reasoning tree that illustrates the basic strategy for reasoning and the overall organization of rules. Reasoning processes are performed approximately following this tree downward. At each node, a decision is made according to the result of a certain calculation. \"O\" and \"X\" are \"yes\" and \"no\", respectively, although results are more precisely evaluated by way of modifying certainty factors. Thus, negative branches can be continued to be followed. Finally, every sorting site has some certainty factor at the end of reasoning and the site with highest certainty will be selected as the probable target site.",

Apparently, most sorting signals are confined to limited regions of sequences; if there were many signals that depend on peptide conformation, like M6P-modons, the prediction accuracy would have been much worse. In addition, our combinational approach has advantages over individual prediction of each localization site. For example, the control data used in the von Heijne et al. analysis of M-transferons (1989) were adopted from the mature portion of mitochondrial proteins. It is more natural to use the N-terminal regions of proteins that compete with mitochondrial ones in real cellular recognition processes. In this respect, it may be an important observation that proteins with internal ER-transferons seem to be similar to mitochondrial proteins in N-terminal amino acid composition.",

The function for S-transferons shows that the segment of residues 1 to 30 is rich in S and A, and the segment of residues 3 to 10 is rich in C. The first variables in both cases were in agreement with the von Heijne et al. observation (1989) , which had been based on different control data. The discriminant function for peroxisomal proteins shows the abundance in aromatic F and W, as well as in Y and H, although its biological significance is unclear. It was also found that lysosomal proteins were poor in K, whereas vacuolar proteins were poor in Q, when compared with extracellular proteins. The content of K was almost sufficient for discriminating lysosomal proteins from vacuolar proteins. It is interesting because lysosomes are acidic organelles.",

            "text": "Several hypotheses were also included in the knowledge base to supplement the experimentally proven knowledge. One hypothesis was that the charge difference between both sides of the most N-terminal transmembrane segment would inhibit its cleavage. It is a natural hypothesis because a reversed orientation along the membrane may be difficult for the signal peptidase to approach. However, some ER-transferons of extracellular proteins had an unusual charge balance, which should be further studied. Another hypothesis was that there would be a preference of type Ib or II proteins depending on the localization site. Usually type Ib proteins have larger cytoplasmic domains and type II proteins have larger extracytoplasmic domains. It is possible that ER membrane proteins, which favor type Ib, possess large cytoplasmic domains for their function, whereas for plasma membrane proteins extracellular domains are important. In fact, a majority of plasma membrane proteins have type Ia topology with short cytoplasmic tails. More samples should be collected for further consideration.",

In the current system, knowledge of polarized sorting in the plasma membrane (Simons and Wandinger-Ness, 1990) has not been included. Knowledge of cell type will also be required for precise prediction. The distinction between constitutive and regulated secretions will also become possible. The prediction of intraorganelle sorting is still insufficient. One reason is that their member proteins may not have been allocated exactly by experiments. Another reason is that in both mitochondria and chloroplasts, membrane proteins have relatively low hydrophobicity, reflecting the different natures of organelle membranes. Proteins with higher hydrophobicity may have a higher possibility of being falsely recognized by signal recognition particles. In practice, it may be effective to change the threshold of discrimination of their transmembrane segments. Many comparton signals are still open to future study. Above all, the integration of various kinds of degron (degradation) and modon (modification) signals is a challenging subject, enabling the prediction of the overall metabolic fate of proteins.",

One such example has been reported recently (Adams et al., 1992) . Of the 2375 partial cDNA sequences that were newly determined, 83% were not related to known sequences in the databases. Our goal is to provide additional clues to the characterization of such unknown sequence data for further investigations. However, there is one difficulty in applying our work to the results of partial cDNA data; our method requires full-length sequences for input because missing parts can involve important targeting signals. Nevertheless, it may be used to find some signals. Sequencing N-terminal halves seems more preferable to C-terminal halves for our analyses since many transferons are found in N-terminal parts.",
