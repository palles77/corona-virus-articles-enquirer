For the safety test, four dogs were inoculated, two by intramuscular and two by oronasal route, with 10 times the vaccinal dose. During the observation period (28 days) all dogs did not display any local or systemic reaction. For the efficacy test, eight dogs were vaccinated by intramuscular (four dogs-group A) or by oronasal route (four dogs-group B). Two dogs were maintained as non-vaccinated controls. In the dogs of group A, vaccinal virus was not detected in faecal samples by virus isolation (VI) and by PCR assay, while in the dogs of group B, the virus was revealed for six median days only by PCR. Twenty-eight days later, the vaccinated and control dogs were challenged with a field CCoV strain. After the challenge, the vaccinated dogs did not display clinical signs and the dogs of group A shed virus for 5.5 median days, evaluated by VI, and for 10 median days evaluated by PCR. Virus shedding was not observed, both by VI and PCR assay, in the dogs of group B. The two control dogs displayed moderate clinical signs and the virus was detected by VI for 14.5 median days starting from day 3 post-challenge (dpc 3) and by PCR assay for 23 median days starting from dpc 1.",

            "text": "The role of CCoV in inducing enteric illness in canids has been the subject of active investigation for over two decades. The virus is responsible for mild to moderate enteritis in dogs; in young pups, or in combination with other pathogens, illness may be severe with diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydration, loss of appetite and even death (Evermann et al., 1980; Appel, 1988) . Shedding of CCoV in faeces occurs over a range of 6-14 days post-infection (Keenan et al., 1976; Tennant et al., 1991) , however, faecal shedding in infected pups has been detected by n-PCR for periods from 37 to 150 days (Pratelli et al., 2001 (Pratelli et al., , 2002a . The value of CCoV vaccines in providing adequate immunity under field conditions is controversial. Although the efficacy and the duration of immunity engendered by inactivated vaccines have not been substantiated, killed CCoV vaccines have been licensed in the USA. In a recent study, the low efficacy of an inactivated CCoV vaccine in reducing the viral shedding in faeces of dogs after CCoV infection is described (Pratelli et al., 2003) . A modified-live (ML) CCoV vaccine was licensed in USA in 1983, but was rapidly withdrawn due to a high rate (about 5%) of serious adverse reactions (Martin, 1985; Wilson et al., 1986) . A ML CCoV vaccine, available in California and recently licensed in USA, appears to be safe and 1-year duration of immunity is claimed by the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the CCoV vaccine, when combined with canine cell-grown distemper vaccine (Rockborn strain), resulted in a high frequency of post-distemper encephalitis (Carmichael, 1997) .",
