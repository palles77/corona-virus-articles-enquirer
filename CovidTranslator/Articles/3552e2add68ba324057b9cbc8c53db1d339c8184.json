Oseltamivir was also given to the initial patients to treat possible influenza infection. Clinical symptoms, blood oxygen saturation, and chest radiograph were assessed daily. If fever persisted after 48 h, patients were given a combination of ribavirin and ''low-dose'' corticosteroid therapy commencing on Days 3 -4 (oral ribavirin as a loading dose of 2.4 g followed by 1.2 g three times daily and prednisolone 0.5 -1 mg/kg body weight per day), whereas those with dyspnea were treated with intravenous ribavirin (400 mg every 8 h), combined with hydrocortisone (100 mg every 8 h). Pulses of high-dose methylprednisolone (0.5 g IVI for three consecutive days) were given as a response to persistent or recurrent fever, and radiographic progression of lung opacity with or without hypoxemia, despite initial combination therapy. Further pulses of methylprednisolone were given if there was no clinical or radiological improvement, at a total dose of up to 3 g. The intention was to continue with the combination of ribavirin and ''low-dose'' corticosteroid for up to 12 days, when there was complete resolution of lung opacity. Those who became afebrile, but with incomplete radiological resolution, were given oral ribavirin 600 mg t.i.d. and prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg body weight per day for at least one further week.",

While all these patients had reduced BMD, those who were on intermittent high-dose steroid therapy had the lowest BMD. Finally, in a cohort study, Saito et al.

The inhibition of bone formation is attributable to a shift in the differentiation of mesenchymal cells away from the osteoblastic lineage [8, 9] ; and an increase in the death of mature osteoblasts [10] . Moreover, the function of the remaining osteoblasts is diminished, through the inhibition of insulin-like growth factor I expression [11] . Glucocorticoids stimulate osteoclastogenesis and increase the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor B legend and colony stimulating factor I [12] , and decrease the expression of osteoprotegerin [13, 14] . Such in vitro findings were corroborated by the results of a clinical study of BMD and bone turnover in asthmatics receiving inhaled steroids [15] , in whom reduced endogenous glucocorticoid and adrenal androgen levels were described.",
