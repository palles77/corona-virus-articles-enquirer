( Collectins comprise a family of calcium-dependent pattern-recognition lectins that bind oligosaccharide structures on the surface of microorganisms to facilitate clearance through aggregation, complement lysis, and opsonization. Two members of this family, DC-SIGN (CD209) and the related molecule DC-SIGNR (L-SIGN, CD209L), have been extensively studied for their ability to bind a variety of viral pathogens. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Indeed, these molecules are often referred to as 'viral attachment factors' and can potentiate infectivity of some viruses. 11 DC-SIGN is reported to be expressed on a subset of macrophages and dendritic cells, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] whereas DC-SIGNR is expressed on endothelial cells within the liver sinusoids and lymph nodes. 11, 17 DC-SIGN promotes cellular uptake and presentation of antigen and potentiates the interaction of DC-SIGN-expressing cells with leukocytes via an interaction with intercellular adhesion molecule-3. 18 Recent biochemical and structural studies suggest that DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR have different physiological functions and distinct ligand-binding properties. 19 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 3 is an enveloped positivestranded RNA virus and the sole member of the Hepacivirus genus, within the family Flaviviridae. Approximately 170 million individuals are infected worldwide, and the majority are at risk of developing progressive liver disease. Cellular and humoral immune responses are generated during HCV infection, but in the majority of individuals, humoral immune responses are inefficient to effect viral clearance, with \u03f380% of new infections becoming chronic. The liver is thought to be the primary reservoir supporting HCV replication, although studies on HCV cell entry and tropism have been limited due to technical difficulties in propagating infectious HCV in cell culture. However, the recent development of infectious retroviral pseudotypes bearing HCV glycoproteins (HCVpp) 20 -22 and the robust replication of HCV strain JFH in cell culture (HCVcc) 8, [23] [24] [25] have enabled studies on HCV cell entry. HCVpp and HCVcc show a restricted tropism for human liver cell lines, and infection is dependent on CD81 expression. 20 -22,24 -26 We 6 and others 2, 4, 5, 27 demonstrated that HCVpp can interact with DC-SIGN-and DC-SIGNR-expressing cells; however, the physiological relevance of these virus-lectin interactions for HCV infection of the liver remains unclear.",

We confirm that these receptors are functional by demonstrating their ability to bind HCV E2 protein and show that stimulation of isolated HSECs with interleukin-4 (IL-4) increases expression of both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, promoting HCV E2 binding. However, isolated HSECs do not support HCVpp or HCVcc infection, suggesting that expression of these receptors is not sufficient to render these cells permissive for HCV infection. Expression of DC-SIGN on HSECs may allow internalization of antigens, including HCV particles for subsequent processing and presentation to na\u00efve T cells. If these interactions result in ineffective T-cell activation or tolerance, they may contribute to the failed immune response against HCV infection.",

HCV E2 binding to IL-4-stimulated HSECs could be inhibited by prior incubation of the cells with mAbs specific for either DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR. Preincubation with combinations of both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR mAbs did not alter the inhibition of HCV E2 binding seen with the single mAb alone ( Figure 3B ). The finding of complete block with each antibody is surprising. One possible interpretation derives from the observation that these lectins exist as tetramers at the cell surface. 37, 38 Our finding that primary HSECs express both receptors may support a model for hetero-oligomer formation between the two related lectins, which may explain our observations with antibody blocking HCV E2 to these primary cell types. We have shown previously that the mAbs used in this study bind specifically to 293-T cells transduced to express the appropriate receptors. 39 ",

There appear to be differences in the intensity of DC-SIGN-R staining across the sinusoidal bed with a relatively weaker staining in the periportal sinusoids. This may reflect differences in the local microenvironment, a conclusion that is supported by the observations that other proteins, including adhesion molecules, are differentially expressed across hepatic sinusoids.

E2 bound diffusely and in focal areas within the sinusoids, and binding could be inhibited by mannan, a sugar molecule reported to interact with the carbohydrate recognition sites of C-type lectins (Figure 7, A and  B) . To confirm the identity of cells that bound HCV E2, sections were counterstained with mAbs specific for macrophage mannose receptor, CD68, and DC-SIGNR (Figure 8, A and B) . These data confirm that HCV E2 interacts with both Kupffer and sinusoidal endothelial cells within the liver, consistent with the pattern of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR expression. To confirm that HCV E2 binding was dependent on DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR expression, liver sections were preincubated with mAbs specific for DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR and evaluated for their ability to bind HCV E2. Pretreatment of liver sections with a control isotype-matched IgG2b mouse immunoglobulin had no effect on E2 binding ( Figure 9A ). The mAb specific for DC-SIGN inhibited E2 binding to both Kupffer and sinusoidal cells ( Figure 9B ), whereas the mAb specific for DC-SIGNR only attenuated E2 binding to sinusoidal cells ( Figure 9C ). However, we also used E2 derived from HCV strain H77, which binds with high affinity to CD81. To distinguish E2-H77 interacting with CD81 and the lectins DC-SIGN(R), we used two anti-E2 mAbs that could discriminate between E2 bound to CD81. These experiments allowed us to confirm the results we obtained with E2-HCJ4 with an independent strain of E2 (data not shown). These data conclusively show DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR expressed in normal liver are able to interact with HCV E2.",

However, the assumption that DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR expressed in heterologous cells accurately mimics primary HSEC lectin-dependent interactions with HCV is undermined by a recent report 43 that DC-SIGN interaction with human immunodeficiency virus is dependent on the cellular context. To address this issue we purified HSECs from three donor livers, confirmed CD81, DC-SIGN, and DC-SIGNR expression, and evaluated their ability to support HCVpp entry. Virus entry and uncoating is quantified by luciferase expression in the target cell under the control of the retroviral promoter and is directly proportional to the frequency of infected cells. 21 Pseudotypic particles with no envelope glycoproteins were used to control for nonspecific particle uptake and viruses expressing vesicular stomatitis virus G served as a control for retroviral RNA transcription and translation of the luciferase reporter gene within the primary cells. HCVpp bearing strain HCJ4 and H77 glycoproteins infected Hep3B hepatoma cells and primary human hepatocytes but failed to infect HSECs ( Figure  10 ).

Expression of DC-SIGN by HSECs provides further evidence for the ability of HSECs to process and present microbial antigens. We show that primary HSECs are unable to support HCVpp and HCVcc entry. These data are consistent with a model where DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR on sinusoidal endothelium provide a mechanism for high affinity binding of circulating HCV within the liver sinusoids allowing transfer of the virus to underlying hepatocytes, in a manner analogous to dendritic cell DC-SIGN presenting HIV to T lymphocytes. 41 Viral capture at the cell surface can be rate limiting for infection, 11, 44, 45 suggesting that expression of both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR on HSECs may enhance the rate and efficiency of virus infection of hepatocytes expressing the coreceptors, CD81 and scavenger receptor BI. 11, 46 DC-SIGN is able to recognize highly mannosylated glycoproteins at the surface of a broad range of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. 47, 48 For at least some of these agents, this interaction appears to be an important component of the infection process, as demonstrated for human immunodeficiency virus and Ebola virus, making DC-SIGN an attractive target for drug design. 47, 49, 50 Glycodendritic polymers that block the binding of pathogen glycoproteins to DC-SIGN inhibit DC-SIGN-mediated infection in an Ebola-pseudotyped viral model. 47, 49 In addition, these lectins may provide a viral escape mechanism as uptake of HCV by DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR has been reported to target nonlysosomal compartments in immature DCs, whereas Lewis X antigen, another ligand of DC-SIGN, was internalized to lysosomes. 51 Thus, DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR on HSECs may not only act to capture HCV from blood but may also allow HSECs to act as reservoirs for HCV, allowing the virus to avoid detection and to be transmitted to the underlying hepatocyte, the primary target for HCV.",

HSECs can act as organ-resident, nonmyeloid antigen processing cells by cross-presenting soluble exogenous antigen to CD8\u03e9 T cells using similar mechanisms of antigen processing and presentation as dendritic cells. However, the outcome of cross-presentation by HSECs is CD8\u03e9 T cell tolerance, and major histocompatibility class II-restricted antigen presentation by HSECs to naive CD4 \u03e9 T cells leads to differentiation into IL-4/IL-10-expressing Th2 cells. 30, 52 The presence of DC-SIGN on HSECs may allow these cells to capture and endocytose a range of microbial pathogens for subsequent presentation to the immune system. Furthermore, DC-SIGN can also act as an adhesion receptor to support interactions with intercellular adhesion molecule-3 on T cells during antigen presentation and on dendritic cells during transendothelial migration, extending the potential role of HSECs in immune responses. Because HSECs can support binding of HCV glycoproteins, we went on to determine whether they can also support viral infection. HSECs were prepared from three different livers, and all infections were preformed in triplicates. HCVpp bearing strain HCJ4 and H77 glycoproteins infected Hep3B hepatoma cells but failed to infect HSECs. Preincubating the HSECs with IL-4 (100 ng/ml) for 24 hours did not alter the results. HCV-MLV and HCV-No env served as positive and negative control experiments, respectively. Successful infection was measured by quantifying the luciferase reporter gene and expressed as relative light units (RLU). Figure 11 . Infection of Huh-7.5 cells, but not primary HSECs, with J6/JFH HCVcc in coculture. Huh-7.5 cells (A) and primary HSECs (B) have contrasting and distinctive morphologies in culture. To assess whether primary HSECs can be infected with J6/JFH, HSECs were cultured with persistently infected Huh-7.5 cells. The cells were mixed at an Huh-7.5:HSEC ratio of 1:4 and seeded at 200,000 cells per well in collagen coated 6-well plates. The following day the coculture had a distinct appearance in which HSECs and Huh-7.5 cells formed discrete foci (C). A control population of J6/JFHinfected Huh-7.5 cells was seeded at the same density in the absence of HSECs (D). Cocultures were maintained for 48 hours, and J6/JFH infection was monitored by staining for HCV NS5A antigen. Viral antigen was detected in the persistently infected Huh-7.5 cells (D) and within the coculture (E). Viral antigen was only detected in the Huh-7.5 cells and not within the HSECs, consistent with primary HSECs failing to support HCVpp infection ( Figure 10 ).",

Treatment of HSECs with IL-4 24 hours before infection did not alter the results. To establish whether J6/JFH HCVcc could infect HSECs, we cocultured J6/JFH-infected Huh-7.5 cells with primary HSECs. After 48 hours, HCV infection in the isolated and cocultured cells was determined by immunostaining for HCV NS5A antigen. Viral antigen was only detected in the Huh-7.5 cells(Figure 11), consistent with the HSECs cells failing to support HCVpp infection.
