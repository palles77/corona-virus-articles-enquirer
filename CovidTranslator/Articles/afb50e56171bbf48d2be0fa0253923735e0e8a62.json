Adenovirus infections can result in severe complications in some cases, such as in adenovirus type 11 infection in immunocompromised patients. However, effective treatment methods for adenovirus infections are currently unavailable. This prompted the search for antiviral agents effective against adenovirus infections. In the present study, adenovirus E1A was targeted by RNA interference (RNAi) using synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in an attempt to inhibit viral replication, since adenovirus E1A proteins are known to be involved in the transcriptional activation of the viral and cellular genes necessary for controlling the cell cycle and viral replication. The results indicated that the siRNAs effectively reduced the amount of adenovirus E1A mRNA and the levels of replicative intermediates. Additionally, siRNAmediated gene silencing inhibited adenovirus repli-cation by suppressing the E1A mRNA. These results suggest that the RNAi-mediated targeting of adenovirus E1A may have a potentially therapeutic effect in controlling adenovirus infections. \u00c3 Yoon-Seok Chung and Min-Kyung Kim contributed equally to this work.",

The clinical manifestations caused by Adv infections vary considerably; most of them are mild and resolve without special chemotherapy. However, a severe Adv infection may occur in immunocompromised patients, such as those with leukemia, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and kidney or bone marrow allograft transplantation. Several reports of severe Adv type 11 (Adv11) urinary infections in immunocompromised patients prompted the search for antiviral agents effective against Adv replication [10, 12] . A number of investigators have reported several agents that exhibit antiviral activity against Adv in vitro [7, 10] . However, there is currently no effective and specific antiviral chemotherapy for Adv infections.",

The E1 region is the only viral region that requires immediate transcription, and the first mRNA=protein produced is E1A. Three different types of open reading frames (ORFs), with varying splicing patterns, have been identified in the E1A region of Adv. The spliced E1A mRNAs encoding the E1A proteins are expressed during the early stage of infection. The E1A proteins activate transcription from early viral promoters via a mechanism that requires a forty-amino-acid zinc finger activation domain [12, 18] . Furthermore, the E1A proteins interact with the cellular regulators of transcription to reprogram gene expression in the infected cell [1, 21] . These observations suggest that the degradation of E1A mRNA may inhibit Adv11 replication.",

The key players in RNAi are small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which consist of 21-23 nucleotides. Once introduced into a cell, the siRNA is incorporated into a nuclease complex, called an RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex), that subsequently recognizes and cleaves the target mRNA [6, 8, 9, 15, 16] .

The E1A region of Adv11 produces three different types of ORFs with vary-ing splicing patterns. ORFs encoding polypeptides of 262, 231 and 58 residues (R) have been identified in the E1A region of Adv11. The mRNA encoding 262R of Adv11 E1A, which contains a zinc-finger motif (i.e., CX 2 CX 13 CX 2 C), is approximately 870 bp in length [12] . It was focused on designing siRNAs that remain effective despite the genetic variation and target sequences located at 262R of the E1A region. The designed siRNAs did not have more than 1 mismatch in the 21 nucleotides among the different types of Adv, and they did not share homology with any known human genes. Five siRNA molecules corresponding to the E1A region of Adv11 were designed and evaluated (Fig. 1, Table 1 ).",

The technique, called RNAi, uses very small pieces of artificially made genetic material known as siRNA. The RNAi technique is based on a natural strategy, discovered just a few years ago [4, 19] , that is used by plants, worms, and other lower species to ward off viruses. This technique was initially used to study the functions of individual genes. This evolutionarily conserved mechanism, triggered by dsRNA, specifically suppresses gene expression by selectively degrading mRNAs matching the sequence of the dsRNA responsible for triggering the response without affecting the expression of other genes. The recent demonstration that synthetic 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes effectively inhibit mammalian endogenous gene expression in a sequence-specific manner without activating nonspecific dsRNA responses shows that this gene silencing pathway may have great potential for use in the study of the function of mammalian virus genes [20] . Ui-Tei et al. [17] reported that highly effective RNAi was found to occur in mammalian cells if the siRNA satisfied the following sequence criteria: (i) A=U at the 5 0 end of the antisense strand; (ii) G=C at the 5 0 end of the sense strand; (iii) AU-richness in the 5 0 end, a 7-bp long region of the antisense; and (iv) the absence of any long GC stretch greater than 9 bp in length [17] . Although five siRNAs were designed for use in the present study, not all siRNAs proved to be effective at silencing E1A. Only two siRNAs, siRNAs 295 and 499, were found to be effective. These two siRNAs well satisfied the above criteria for designing a highly effective siRNA, whereas siRNAs 135, 509 and 794 did not.",

The results of the present study showed that siRNAs with a sequence homologous to the gene encoding Adv E1A efficiently inhibited the synthesis of the E1A protein by degrading the E1A mRNA. Figure 3 shows a dramatic decrease in the level of E1A mRNA after transfection with siRNAs 295 and 499. Subsequently, as shown by the plaque reduction assay, the yield of progeny virus that resulted from an infection was reduced by 1000-3000-fold upon treatment with siRNAs 295 and 499, in comparison to the virus-infection-only control. As a result of the inhibition of plaque formation, the replication of Adv 2K2=507=KNIH in A549 cells was significantly hindered. These results verified the potential for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection by adenovirus type 11.",

Since the Adv 2K2=507=KNIH showed low variation in the E1A region, the susceptibility of the Adv11 prototype virus to the siRNA-mediated inhibition of viral replication was tested. Treatment with siRNA also reduced the plaque formation of the Adv11 prototype by approximately 10 4 -fold compared to that of the control infection performed in the absence of the siRNA (data not shown).",

Therefore, an effective chemotherapy for Adv11 infections is very much in need. In the present study, siRNAs 295 and 499 were shown to be effective in reducing the amount of Adv E1A mRNA, levels of replicative intermediates, and the viral protein. These results indicate that siRNAmediated gene silencing inhibits Adv replication through the suppression of viral RNA. Such an siRNA-based method clearly shows potential as a novel therapeutic treatment for Adv11 infections.",
