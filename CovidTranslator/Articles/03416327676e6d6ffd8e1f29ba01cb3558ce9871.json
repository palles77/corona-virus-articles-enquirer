Screening of the hybridoma: The fusion result was checked every day. On day 8, cell supernatant of the wells in 96-well plates was detected using CVS-11 RV antigen plate by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) technique:50\u00b5L supernatant of the selected hybridoma was added into the wells of CVS-11 RV antigen plate and incubated at 37\u2103 for 30 min, then FITC-goat anti-mouse IgG was added. After 30 min at 37\u2103, 60% glycerol was added, observation was conducted through the fluorescence microscope. The positive results showed as specific yellow-green fluorescent granules against the red colored cell background.

DISCUSSION In this study, we report the production of anti-rabies virus monoclonal antibodies as the first step in the development of a rapid and specific reagent for the diagnosis of rabies virus infection. In the process of developing this kind of reagent, we observed a number of important considerations necessary for an effective and efficient technique. The experimental immunogens used in this study were an inactivated rabies virus vaccine strain (PV) for human use and an expressed nucleoprotein of rabies virus. They were both diluted in the proportion of 1:10 after concentration for immunization and since they retained some cellular components, the generation of anti-cellular monoclonal antibodies was inevitable. To minimize the false positive results, a negative cell control was used during identification. The injection method is conducive to generating large numbers of spleen B-lymphocytes. The results showed that the spleens of mice after full-course immunization were double that of normal mice, with the number of spleen cells up to 2.0 \u00d7 10 8 . In this study, dilution was conducted in advance of fusion using twenty 96-well plates with, in principle, only 1-2 cells in each well. The results showed that the proportions of single cells were 21.4% and 19%, respectively, which was different from the traditional fusion step conducted directly on the fused single cells, eliminating the need to clone a large number of the fused cells. The number of cloning cycles in the actual experimental process could be reduced to one or two. To increase the survival rate of hybridoma, feeder cells were prepared l-2 d before fusion. Peritoneal macrophages of syngenic mice were usually selected as feeder cells. Generally, feeder cells prepared from Balb/c mice weighing about 18g can pave three to four 96-well cell culture plates. The activity and the pollution status of cells were observed on the second day; cells which show a poor activity, no adherence or have been polluted cannot be used. The loss of certain chromosomes during the amplification can cause the",

One corresponds to the IgG heavy chain, at about 50 KD, and the other corresponds to the IgG light chain, at about 25 KD; there are many more protein bands in unpurified samples, indicating that the vast majority of impure protein is removed after the purification of ascitic fluid. Presently, rabies is an important zoonotic disease seriously threatening public health. Rapid and effective diagnoses as well as proper preventive measures are particularly important. Monoclonal antibodies prepared in this experiment were identified as anti-rabies virus monoclonal antibodies and have an important application value. Labeling these monoclonal antibodies and developing corresponding detection techniques will be the next steps of to allow their use in the near future for the diagnosis of rabies virus infection and control of rabies vaccine quality.",
