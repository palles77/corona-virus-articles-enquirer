We aim to identify methods to accurately estimate VES when limited information is available and resources are constrained. We model an individually randomized vaccine trial by generating a network of individuals and simulating an epidemic. The disease natural history follows a Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Symptomatic or Infectious and Asymptomatic, Recovered model. We then use seven approaches to estimate VES, and we also estimate vaccine efficacy against progression to symptoms (VEP). A corrected relative risk and an interval censored Cox model accurately estimate VES and only require serologic testing of participants once, while a Cox model using only symptomatic infections returns biased estimates. Only acquiring serological endpoints in a 10% sample and imputing the remaining infection statuses yields unbiased VES estimates across values of R0 and accurate estimates of VEP for higher values. Identifying resource-preserving methods for accurately estimating VES is important in designing trials for diseases with a high proportion of asymptomatic infection.",

The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has dedicated one billion dollars to vaccine development efforts starting with three of these: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, Lassa virus and Nipah virus (2) . These three pathogens, as well as others on the WHO's list, such as Zika virus, have high proportions of asymptomatic or mild infection (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Vaccine efficacy against susceptibility to infection (VES) (8) , regardless of symptom level, is an important endpoint of vaccine trials for these pathogens, as infection may contribute to onward transmission, and outcomes such as Congenital Zika Syndrome, even without primary symptoms (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . However, VES is resource-intensive to estimate as it requires testing all trial participants, either by periodically conducting assays for infection throughout the trial, or by serologic testing at the trial's conclusion if natural and vaccine-derived immune responses can be distinguished. Testing trial participants is also necessary for estimating a vaccine's efficacy against progression (VEP) to symptoms, another critical outcome measurement (8) . As noted in an analysis of dengue vaccine trial results, protection against symptomatic infection may in general differ from protection against infection (and in the case of dengue, VEP may be negative due to antibody dependent enhancement) (15) . It is therefore important to consider estimates of both VES and VEP when analyzing trial results.",

We simulate an epidemic in the main population with a seasonal transmission rate that generates an epidemic curve with a shape similar to the epidemic curve of the 2015 Zika outbreak in Brazil (17) . The disease is introduced into communities via infectious contact with the main population, and transmission occurs when infected individuals transmit to their susceptible connections in the communities. All susceptible individuals have a daily probability of infection from each of their infectious neighbors of 1-e -\u03b2 , where \u03b2 is the force of infection, as well as a daily external hazard of infection from the main population, which varies with the prevalence in the main population.

The vaccine is leaky, meaning it reduces the probability of infection upon each exposure to an infectious individual.

Trial status (i.e. vaccine or control) is the explanatory variable for all Cox proportional hazards models, and individuals who are never infected are censored at the end of the trial. Approach 1 assumes that the time of infection is known exactly (to the day) even for asymptomatic infections and therefore would be strictly applicable only where very frequent testing is performed throughout the trial. Approach 2 assumes that infection is unobserved for asymptomatic infections, so only symptomatic infections are included in the Cox regression, and those infected asymptomatically are assumed to have survived without infection to the end of follow up.",

Including those with preexisting immunity in the trial would reduce the total number of overall cases, and thus the power, limiting the ability to draw a statistically significant conclusion about the vaccine's effects. This challenge however is not limited to diseases with high proportions of mild or asymptomatic infection, as prior immunity would reduce the power of any trial. Additionally, distinguishing between natural and vaccine-derived immunity can be challenging, especially at the beginning of an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease about which not much is known and for which serologic tests are likely in early stages of development (22,25). Therefore, investments in diagnostic development will also be critical for ensuring accurate VE estimates. Finally, many simplifying assumptions are made, including complete ascertainment of infectious cases, perfect sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test, and comparability of the infected vaccinees and infected controls for the estimation of VEP (8) .",

            "text": "). Similar results are obtained in the analyses of the five communities (Figures 4-5). However, when the number of cases is low (R0=1), the meta-analyses of Approaches 4 and 7 are imprecise. Results are essentially unchanged across changes in duration of the trial or vaccine efficacy, and when the proportion symptomatic among the vaccine and control groups differs (i.e. VEP \u2260 0), as shown in Figures S1-5. When the vaccine has an effect on both susceptibility to infection and progression to symptoms, serologic testing helps differentiate between VES and VEP except when the number of total cases is low. DISCUSSION For pathogens with a high proportion of mild or asymptomatic infection, understanding if the vaccine prevents all infection, not solely symptomatic infection, as well as understanding the vaccine's impact on progression to symptoms, is critical for determining the epidemiologic impact of the vaccine. However, costs and resources can pose major barriers to estimating these critical values. Here we have discussed different methods and their varying levels of accuracy model (Approach 7) provide estimates close to the VES input into the model across values of R0, which is of course also obtained under the assumption of perfect knowledge of the time of all asymptomatic infections (Approach 1). A Cox model considering only symptomatic infections proves biased, especially at higher values of R0. Approaches 1 and 4-7 return accurate estimates of VEP, with the exception of Approach 7 when R0 is low due to the small number of cases overall and in the sample. In practice, using a Cox proportional hazards model for the time of all infections would entail testing everyone frequently (perhaps weekly or even daily) for infection throughout the trial, requiring significant expenditures of both money and time. Using a corrected relative risk estimate or an interval censored Cox model, an accurate estimate of VES and VEP can be obtained with serologic testing only once at the end of the trial. Testing only 10% of the trial population and imputing the event status of the remaining asymptomatic trial participants substantially reduces the resources needed while still providing critical information about the vaccine.",
