            "text": "Background: Emergency Departments (ED) are challenged during influenza season by patients who present acutely during sporadic ED visits. ED management is largely empiric, often occurring without reliable diagnostics needed for targeted therapies, safe outpatient discharge, or hospital admissions. Objective: To evaluate the impact of the influenza diagnosis on physician decision making during ED visits using the Cobas Liat \u00ae influenza A + B assay. Study design: Prospective study assessing the impact of rapid (< 30 min), reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) influenza testing on physician decision making in the ED. Physician responses established preand post-diagnosis management courses which required confirmation via secondary documentation in the medical record. Changes in physician decision making were analyzed across four clinical touchpoints: (i) admission/discharge status, (ii) medical procedures, (iii) antiviral and antibiotic prescribing, and (iv) laboratory studies. Results: An influenza diagnosis changed patient management courses, relative to empiric, pre-diagnosis plans, in in 61% of the cases resulting in cost savings of $49,420-to-$42,270 over 143 patients and 104 days during influenza season resulting in a cost savings of $200.40/ED visit. Evaluation over 2000 ED patient visits projects cost savings > $578,000 due to deferred admissions, and reduction in antiviral prescribing. Sensitivity of EDbased influenza testing using the Cobas Liat \u00ae assay was equivalent to centralized lab testing at 98.8% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity respectively. Conclusion: Providing rapid, RT-PCR influenza testing to ED settings is actionable and used to guide patient care decisions. Understanding the cascade of events linked to the influenza diagnosis in the ED provides overall cost savings which offset the cost of providing ED-based testing.",

Molecular influenza testing for ED patients is an area of active investigation and many groups have compared new molecular platforms to traditional testing methods demonstrating increased sensitivity and improved antiviral utilization [6] . Newer PCR assays technologies contribute to overall reductions in length of inpatient stay and time to isolation [7] , however, access to RT-PCR was still unable to reach nearly 50% of patients in time to direct admission decisions in the ED [8] because testing occurs in centralized laboratories. Thus, key questions surrounding the clinical utility and financial impact of rapid molecular testing for ED patients still exist.",

Systematic analysis of this assumption is lacking. To address this unanswered question, we employed a novel prospective study design during a 24 h/7days/week evaluation during 104 days of the 2014-2015 influenza season. The primary aim was to evaluate the impact of a new rapid RT-PCR assay, the Roche Cobas Liat \u00ae (Liat \u00ae ) assay, on physician decision making in the ED during the patient visit. Changes in physician decision making post influenza diagnosis were analyzed across four clinical touchpoints. Secondary aims targeted the cost-effectiveness of RT-PCR testing in the ED, which were determined based on hospital charges, physician documentation, international classification of disease coding (ICD) and national ED benchmarking data. May 23, 2015 . During the study period, the CDC's adjusted vaccination efficacy (VE) against influenza was 23%. Reduced protection against influenza viruses for the 2014-2015 season occurred because > 80% of circulating influenza viruses analyzed by the CDC experienced antigenic \"drift\" in comparison to viruses covered in the vaccine [12] . Patients presenting to the ED during the study period with at least one sign compatible with influenza infection, including; fever (> = 37.8\u00b0C), cough, sore throat, and muscle aches were eligible to enroll.",

Study surveys comprised a 5-page, 14-question questionnaire spanning four clinical touchpoints: (i) admission/discharge status, (ii) medical procedures, (iii) antiviral and antibiotic prescribing, and (iv) laboratory studies. ED physicians documented the clinical likelihood of influenza based on evaluation of presenting patient symptoms only. The clinical likelihood of influenza was assessed based on a physician's assessment of high, moderate, or low likelihood on influenza.

In consultation with ED staff, we defined a turn-around time for Liat \u00ae testing at < 30 min. Among the total 292 cases tested, 91.7%, (268/292) received an influenza result in the ED within \u226430 min from the order entry.

However, among these 24 cases, 45.8% (11/24) involved patient encounters in the ED stabilization room which require higher levels of care within the ED. These patients often have longer, more complicated ED management, thus it is understandable why many of the patients seen in ED stabilization rooms would experience delays in laboratory testing because testing becomes less of a priority compared to the resuscitation of the patient that occurs in ED stabilization rooms.

Rogers and colleagues recently compared rapid multiplex PCR testing to traditional batch PCR testing among pediatric ED patients, further demonstrating the associations between rapid diagnosis antibiotic stewardship, reduced length of stay, and decreased time to diagnosis [8] . However, despite statistical significance with respect to time to diagnosis, testing was unavailable for 48% of pediatric ED patients in time to influence ED admission [8] . While such studies define the clinical value of rapid RT-PCR-based influenza however, they fall short of establishing clinical utility of ED testing because testing occurs in centralized laboratory locations after the ED visit.

Clinically likelihood of influenza was recorded as direct responses from ED physicians based on their assessment of high, moderate, and low likelihood on influenza. reductions in test ordering frequently focus only on positive influenza results. Given this bias, it is highly likely that the vast majority of influenza testing, which is often negative, results in greater utilization of laboratory testing because testing expands to support narrowing differential diagnoses.",

Many influenza series rely on pre-and post-testing cohorts which are subject to differences in patient acuity, seasonal influenza strains, and differences among physician behavior which collectively influence data sets. Patients who are tested for influenza during flu season often present with additional co-morbidities. In such patients, management decisions and length of hospital stay are influenced by medical issues independent of influenza status which are not accounted for in the vast majority of pre-and post-intervention studies. In order to determine the impact of the influenza diagnosis on patient management we felt it was important to minimize confounding variables which independently affect physician management decisions. While this approach allowed us to further target the impact of influenza testing, it also excluded a number of patients for whom the influenza diagnosis is important. Additionally, 66% (n = 31) of the patients in whom a \u226430 min test result could not be achieved spent time in the ED stabilization room. The acuity of patients who require stabilization in the ED is high and while these patients undoubtedly have additional medical conditions other than respiratory infection they also benefit from rapid access to their influenza diagnosis. Thus, while we limited evaluation to patients in whom influenza testing could be stringently analyzed, we acknowledge that some patients for whom an influenza diagnosis would be helpful were excluded as part of our study design. Limiting patient enrollment to define respiratory infection allowed us to target the effect of the diagnosis, and while this study group demonstrated positive clinical and financial impacts of the rapid influenza diagnosis it is likely an underestimation of the value of providing rapid ED-based RT-PCR testing.",

However, recent experience with the Liat \u00ae assay using various ED and clinic locations indicates that testing can be reliably performed by non-laboratory staff such as nurses, physicians, or allied-health professionals [28] . It should be noted that during our study, testing occurred in the ED environment but was performed by laboratory staff. While we acknowledge the utility of testing using non-laboratory personnel in the ED, the primary aims of our study were to: [1] provide influenza testing within the ED; [2] to deliver a result within the time frame of typical ED visits; and [3] to further describe the impact of the diagnosis on patient management. Any utility gained by using non-laboratory personnel to perform testing requires first demonstrating that providing testing is of clinical benefit. The infrastructure needed to support point-of care testing is complex, requiring staffing support, laboratory oversight (where available), physician space, and education, which are often poorly defined in many studies and were not addressed in our study. Many of these variables were in place prior to our study, which did not impact our costs associated with testing, although we acknowledge that the costs associated with ED-based testing may be different for others. Our findings demonstrate that providing the RT-PCR testing in the ED during the patient visit is an actionable result that influenced and changed physician decision making in 61% of the cases and can be a cost-effective approach. These conclusions lend support for additional studies that can systematically describe the operational insights needed for point-of care testing.",

However, clinical experience demonstrates that both influenza A and B can cause similar illness, present with overlapping clinical presentations and typically respond similarly to oseltamivir therapy. Efforts to capture the impact of the influenza diagnosis in the ED are inclusive of \"influenza infection,\" thus we interpret our findings in the context of influenza despite the relatively low numbers of influenza A infection encountered during the time of our study. Benefits of diagnostic testing are derived from identifying and treating true positives, weighed against the harm or failing to detect influenza in symptomatic patients. During the events of pandemic H1N1 outbreak, early treatment was associated with a decrease in mortality compared to no treatment (odds ratio 0.35; 95% confidence interval 0.18-0.71) [29] emphasizing the importance of diagnostic support for timely antiviral response.",
