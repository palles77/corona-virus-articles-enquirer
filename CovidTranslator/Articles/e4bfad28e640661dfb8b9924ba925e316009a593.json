This paper summarizes findings from studies that address these needs, discusses management implications, and identifies topical areas for further studies. Below, I present the social science contributions to southeast Alaska management issues of traditional ecological knowledge, subsistence, regional tourism trends, effects of tourism in selected communities, and acceptability of timber harvest practices. A discussion and conclusions follow the findings.

First, subsistence harvest of wild foods continues to provide a large portion of the diet for residents of southeast Alaska communities. In most communities studied, consumption of wild game and fish meets or exceeds the national average for consumption of meat, fish, and poultry. Second, per capita harvest levels in Native communities and larger communities remained consistent from 1980 through the recent study. In some smaller communities there was a notable difference, but it could be explained by special events or changes in harvest behavior of a small number of people. Third, subsistence harvest levels differed across the region. The differences in harvest levels among communities cannot always be explained by differences in ethnicity, income, community size, or access to resources. The differences may be related to community demographic composition, cultural traditions, and community history. Additional research is needed to help identify this complex relationship. Finally, some households harvest more fish and wildlife than the household can consume. The surplus is distributed through customary distribution practices including kinship networks, barter, and trade. In Yakutat, 25% of households harvest about 75% of the total community subsistence harvest by weight. The lowest harvesting 50% of all households harvest just 8% of the total community harvest.",

Third, Alaskans travel throughout the state and use the same visitor facilities as tourists. Fourth, tourism is locationspecific; it can be difficult to encourage in some places and almost impossible to stop or slow in others. Finally, no single entity can manage and direct tourism growth. In southeast Alaska, the Forest Service manages 80% of the land, and Native corporations, National Park Service, private owners, and the state (Department of Natural Resources manages tidelands) manage the remainder. Local governments control docks, shore facilities, entry portals, and main retail sites; however, they manage only small amounts of land under their jurisdictions. This multitude of authorities and lack of coordination results in piecemeal planning and management that may be counterproductive or contradictory.",

Not only did the number of cruise ships visiting Juneau almost double between 1987 and 2002, but many of the ships docking in 2002 were larger than those in use in the late 1980s. Most cruise ships visiting southeast Alaska stop in Juneau, making Juneau a good indicator of levels of visitors into the region as a whole. Other communities within the region receive varying levels of cruise ship traffic. Some communities have no cruise ship visits but benefit from shore excursion activities when ships dock in neighboring communities. Still other communities that are remote from cruise ship stops may experience neither the potential costs nor benefits from the growth of the cruise ship industry.",

Analysis of traffic on the Alaska Marine Highway shows a fairly consistent volume. Public ferries operate at capacity during busy summer months, so potential growth is limited until other boats are added to the fleet. Between 1989 and 2002, summer traffic crossing the Canadian border into Skagway increased 40% (Skagway Visitors Bureau, personal communication). In contrast, summer border crossings at Haines have declined 19% since 1993 (Haines Convention and Visitors Bureau, personal communication).",

Maintaining quality bear habitat and creating conditions that enable reliable bear viewing without negatively impacting the bears or creating the potential for bear-human conflicts continues to challenge resource managers. Demand for bear-viewing opportunities is high and the supply is extremely limited.

Residents who depend on subsistence resources are concerned about effects of cruise ship discharges on fish, shellfish, seaweed, and other resources. In Craig, the expansion of the tourism industry into freshwater fishing and flyfishing might impact subsistence uses of lakes and streams.

Shindler and his colleagues found that focusing on the decision-making process is important. A lack of trust in resource agencies results in lack of support for decisions. Context is important. For example, the uniqueness of a place and its meaning is particularly important for citizens, but prescriptive, one-size-fitsall policies ignore most contextual circumstances. Attempting to achieve multiple objectives increases the difficulty of finding acceptable strategies. A rational, technical decision approach does not effectively engage citizens or incorporate their concerns. There is a range of definitions of \"natural conditions\" such that managing for natural conditions is difficult. Natural resource management is an experiment involving uncertainly and risk. Few places exist for shared learning about the risks, the tradeoffs, and thus the acceptability of management approaches.

In 1998 and 1999, 27 respondents from nine interest groups were interviewed to solicit their reactions to eight harvest treatments. The nine groups, selected to represent a diversity of perspectives on the appropriate use and management of national forests, were managers of logging and timber companies, logging and timber laborers, conservationists and environmentalists, Alaska Natives involved in subsistence, active hunters, commercial fishers, and recreational users. Participants within these groups were selected based on their familiarity with forest management issues in general and Hanus Bay in particular. A posterboard displaying the estimated consequences of each harvest treatment was used to provide each participant with the same information and to help respondents think about each treatment. Estimated consequences were displayed in terms of fish productivity, deer productivity, timber yield, biodiversity, residual stand damage, and visual appearance. Arial photos taken after the harvest were provided for each of the eight treatments. Respondents were asked to (1) rate the importance of each consequence, (2) explain the reasons for their rating, (3) discuss the acceptability of each of the treatments, and (4) identify their preferred treatment.",

They provide information to help managers better understand subsistence uses, traditional territories, tourism trends and accompanying challenges, and the complexity of judgments of acceptability. The findings will inform management decisions as well as the next round of forest planning. They provide insight into how people consider, value, and use natural resources and what they think of alternative approaches to management. The studies provide a snapshot of what community members are thinking about the growing tourism industry. Several of the studies demonstrate the importance and value of participatory, inclusive processes.",

Native and non-Native rural communities in Alaska are in transition. What factors contribute to their capacity to adapt to change? How are land managers in other countries gathering and using traditional ecological knowledge? What lessons can we learn from communities that have pursued ecotourism and cultural tourism? What lessons can we share with other parts of the world? Does the use of participatory processes improve social acceptability of management decisions? What processes work and why?",
