This was an opportunity to appreciate the extraordinary accomplishments of modern biology. The discovery paved the way for a renaissance in understanding basic biological principles, which is beginning to have direct application to the treatment of human disease. The year 2004 marks another anniversary: ten years of Nature Medicine, during which time the information derived from basic research has increasingly found its way into clinical practice. Advances in the powerful disciplines of immunology and molecular genetics have been synergistic, and our strengthened understanding of disease pathogenesis has allowed us to conceive and generate new therapies. During the past decade, several technologies once thought promising, but technically challenging, have proven tractable and are making significant inroads into the practice of medicine.",

Indeed, these antibodies quickly became of great practical use in basic research and diagnostic analysis. For at least two decades, monoclonal antibodies have provided fundamental insights into the antigenic structure of proteins and have helped reveal the roles of certain proteins in human disease. But the early promise of monoclonal antibodies as therapeutic agents was slow to materialize. Progress in this area was hampered by a number of technical hurdles: therapeutically relevant targets were difficult to identify, and the cost of producing purified biological reagents was prohibitively high. Worse still, it became evident that the first-generation antibodies derived from mouse hybridomas were themselves subject to immune responses that limited the efficacy and duration of their therapeutic effect.",

Indeed, antibodies to TNF-\u03b1 provided a means to define the role of the cytokine in the immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, while simultaneously becoming a therapeutic intervention. Three monoclonal antibodies have recently been evaluated and licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [3] [4] [5] , and further studies are in progress for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis 6, 7 .

For example, immunoglobulins can now be produced on a large scale in mammalian cells, selected immunoglobulin fragments can be expressed in bacteria, and antibody Fab fragments can be chemically modified (PEGylated) to increase their half-life in vivo. These advances have allowed manufacture at the appropriate scale at decreased expense. Finally, the identification of monoclonal antibodies with different affinities or specificities with respect to the target antigen has led to reagents with alternative properties. In addition to the success for rheumatoid arthritis, monoclonal antibodies have been used with increasing success for the treatment of malignancy. One of the first advances in this field was the targeting of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) for the treatment of T-cell leukemia. This approach grew from basic research that used antibodies to IL-2R to define its role in T-cell proliferation (reviewed in ref. 8) . These studies showed that T-cell signaling through IL-2R is a key process in the development of this form of cancer. The development of monoclonal antibodies to this receptor, as well as the use of the IL-2 protein fused to a toxin 9 , have provided proof of concept that targeting of a cell-specific growth factor receptor can induce a significant clinical response.",

In a clinical trial, patient T lymphocytes were genetically modified in the laboratory (ex vivo) and then reinfused. Although long-term marking was seen in at least one case 35 , no change in immune function was observed, probably because of the low frequency of gene transfer into T cells, the apparent lack of selective expansion of the 'corrected' cells, and possible immunity generated against one of the bacterial resistance genes, neomycin, that was included for positive selection in the retroviral vector.

But the most encouraging advance so far has been in treatment of an inherited severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) caused by mutation of the common \u03b3-chain of the growth factor receptor. In this study, bone marrow cells from five children with SCID-X1 were transduced ex vivo with a replication-defective retroviral vector expressing the functional \u03b3-chain. When these transduced cells were engrafted back into the patients, they repopulated the lymphoid system and restored immune function 40 . This first therapeutic outcome in a gene transfer trial represented a breakthrough in the field. Similar approaches applied to other immune disorders have been without success, however, probably because of differences in the biology of these diseases. And unfortunately, the feature of SCID-X1 deficiency that led to success conferred an unexpected side effect: the uncontrolled proliferation of the gene-modified T cells in several subjects 41 , possibly related to insertional activation of an oncogene in these cells 42 .

In fact, the direct administration of recombinant genes in vivo (as opposed to ex vivo modification and reinfusion of cells) was first performed in a cancer immunotherapy study 45 that documented the expression of a recombinant gene-an allogeneic histocompatibility gene designed to boost antitumor immunity-and the generation of antitumor immunity in five patients. Local and systemic tumor regression was observed in at least one subject. This approach is currently under evaluation in larger phase 3 efficacy trials. Another cancer gene therapy approach is the introduction of immunomodulatory genes, such as cytokines and costimulatory molecules, including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or the B7 costimulatory molecule, into malignant cells to boost antitumor immune responses. In other cases, attempts have been made to replace defective tumor oncogenes such as those encoding p53 or retinoblastoma, although delivery of such gene products to all required cells is technically difficult.

In addition to a variety of modified viral vectors, including poxviruses such as canarypox, fowlpox and modified vaccinia Ankara, researchers have developed novel adenovirus serotypes, alphaviruses, adeno-associated viruses and nonviral vectors such as naked DNA that can be used as vaccine vectors for a variety of infectious diseases (Fig. 3) . Naked DNA has shown particular promise in a variety of different animal models of infectious disease, including HIV 49 60 . This technology has been evaluated in phase 1 human clinical trials for HIV, malaria and influenza virus.",

Based on the X-ray structure, specific rational mutations could be designed to alter, or expose potential antigenic determinants. The definition of functional structures, such as the helical coiled-coil regions of viral envelope glycoproteins 62 , has also revealed highly conserved functional domains that may be susceptible to neutralizing antibodies or other forms of antiviral therapy.

Recent studies have explored the possibility of using vaccination or immune intervention for the treatment of neurologic diseases, specifically Alzheimer disease, based on the ability of antibodies to reduce the formation of neurologic lesions in a mouse model of the disease 66 . A vaccine approach has also been developed for the prevention of atherosclerosis through the generation of antibodies to the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) 67, 68 . CETP inhibition might increase the ratio of high-to low-density lipoproteins; this more favorable lipid profile is found in individuals with specific inherited mutations of CETP associated with protection against cardiovascular disease. Specific vaccine strategies have also been applied to a variety of allergic and autoimmune diseases. Finally, as noted above, the field of cancer immunotherapy has shown increasing promise as tumor antigens have been better defined, and the mechanisms that prevent immune responses to malignancies better understood. Better understanding of the basic molecular lesions and the delivery technology, as well as a more systematic assessment of human immune responses to tumor antigens will likely yield continued improvements in the success of these approaches.",
