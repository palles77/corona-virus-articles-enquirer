            "text": "Developmental and inherited disorders affecting the liver typically present in childhood but may affect individuals of any age. The effect of inherited metabolic disorders on the liver may be considered primary, caused by the accumulation of a metabolite resulting from an enzyme defect (e.g. sphingomyelin in Niemann-Pick disease), or secondary, when the major changes in the liver are the result of a primarily extrahepatic defect (e.g. steatosis of the liver secondary to pancreatic insufficiency in Shwachman syndrome). Likewise, as the list of identified inherited metabolic disorders continues to expand, many have significant but indirect relevance to the liver. For example, liver histology is usually normal in primary hyperoxaluria while the kidneys and other organs may be irreparably damaged; however, despite medical management, dialysis and repetitive kidney transplants, cure is only obtained with a liver transplant. 1 In other inherited disorders, the liver disease may remain asymptomatic until precipitous acute liver failure develops; the classic example is Wilson disease. 2 This similarly occurs with developmental disorders; choledochal cyst may be diagnosed by prenatal sonography, or it may not become evident until late in childhood. In many cases the clinical diagnosis of an inherited disorder is not clinically evident, and consequently, diagnosis becomes the responsibility of the histopathologist, who may save not only the life of the patient, but that of other family members as well. Advances in molecular genetics constantly improve our understanding of the biological basis of many metabolic diseases. Prenatal diagnosis is available for more families.",

Numerous diverse disorders are characterized neonatally by cholestasis and giant cell transformation of liver cells, such as \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency, Niemann-Pick disease type C and bile salt export pump (BSEP) deficiency, also known as progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2. Steatosis is one of the most frequent abnormalities, either alone (as in the urea cycle disorders, homocystinuria, lipoprotein disorders, the mitochondrial cytopathies and Shwachman syndrome) or in combination with other changes such as cholestasis, pseudogland formation and fibrosis (e.g. in galactosaemia, hereditary tyrosinaemia type 1 and hereditary fructose intolerance). Furthermore, neutral lipid may be stored in combination with other metabolites such as cholesterol (e.g. in Wolman disease or cholesterol ester storage disease) or glycogen (as found in glycogen storage disease types I and III). Many disorders of lipid metabolism are expressed morphologically by 'foam' cells (as in Niemann-Pick disease types A and B and the gangliosidoses). 3 The ultimate diagnosis depends on the clinical and laboratory data and identification of the specific enzyme defect. Histological changes may not lead to a specific diagnosis, but characteristic findings add to the phenotypic expression of individual disorders and guide selection of further investigations, in particular enzymatic assays and genomic studies. Accordingly, the following discussion includes the major clinical, laboratory and genetic features-the context in which histological changes should be evaluated.",

The best all-round fixative for light microscopy remains 10% buffered formalin; however, some metabolic diseases (e.g. the mucopolysaccharidoses, cystinosis and the glycogen storage diseases) require special fixatives to prevent leaching of water-soluble metabolites. Special stains for lipid, cholesterol and sphingomyelin must be performed on frozen sections cut from formalin-fixed or fresh material since routine processing will extract the lipid material from the cells. The histopathologist must be familiar with the many special stains that can be used on formalin-fixed and routinely processed material: uroporphyrin, haemosiderin, copper, copper-binding protein, bile, lipofuscin, lipomelanin (the pigment in the Dubin-Johnson syndrome), carbohydrates, mucopolysaccharides and other substances. Immunohistochemical stains are useful in a number of diseases, such as for identifying catalase in patients with peroxisomal diseases or the presence of \u03b11-antitrypsin, \u03b11-antichymotrypsin or fibrinogen in eosinophilic globules in various storage diseases. The repertoire of specific antibodies working on paraffin sections is continuously broadening, including antibodies reacting with various bile canalicular transporters such as the BSEP and multidrug-resistance protein 3 (MDR3); such antibodies can be commercially sourced and are readily available in specialist centres. Special microscopy should be utilized whenever necessary. The porphyrins can be demonstrated by their autofluorescence in frozen sections made from unfixed hepatic biopsy or autopsy material. Polarizing microscopy is especially useful for the identification of various crystals such as cholesterol, cystine, calcium oxalate, uroporphyrin and protoporphyrin.",

Selection of appropriate pathological studies must be made before liver biopsy, to ensure appropriate fixation and handling of samples. Prebiopsy consultation with a histopathologist, and at times with laboratory staff of a centre dealing with highly specialized techniques, may preclude the loss of diagnostic information. In general, a portion of the biopsy core at least 5 mm in length should be snap-frozen using optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, which does not interfere with most enzyme assays and allows subsequent frozen sectioning for microscopy. Ideally, a few bits (1 mm 3 ) should be immersed in a fixative appropriate for EM. Tissue freezing and EM fixative, in addition to usual fixation and paraffin processing, should be applied to all biopsy specimens taken from children or older patients in whom a metabolic disorder is suspected.",

In the lobule, giant cell transformation with multinucleation of hepatocytes and canalicular bile plugs are also present. These portal changes are typically seen at about 6 weeks of life in infants with BA. These may be very mild or absent in biopsies taken earlier than 6 weeks. Biopsies from neonates 2-4 days old have shown minimal portal changes, suggesting that the portal changes observed later are the result of the perinatal bile flow causing periductal leakage and consequent inflammation and fibrosis. 10 The typical obstructive pattern observed in BA can be simulated by other disorders, such as \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency (alpha-1AT), cystic fibrosis and MDR3 deficiency. Steatosis often accompanies the biliary changes in both \u03b11-antrypsin deficiency and cystic fibrosis. Diastase-resistant periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive globules are usually not evident in the first few months of life but may be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for \u03b11-antitrypsin. If present, eosinophilic cholangiolar casts are a classic finding in liver biopsies from patients with cystic fibrosis. MDR3 deficiency is caused by a mutation of the ABCB4 gene, which encodes for the MDR3 protein, critical for the transport of phospholipids, and in particular phosphatidylcholine, into the bile. Without phosphatidylcholine, bile salts are not incorporated into micelles. The bile remains hydrophobic and damages the biliary epithelium, causing a cholangiopathy, without gross architectural changes to the bile ducts, which may nevertheless manifest histologically with an obstructive pattern. Conditions manifesting with an obstructive pattern simulating BA include total parenteral nutrition, sepsis and the so-called inspissated bile syndrome associated with ABO incompatibility.",

Overall, predictors of poor prognosis include persisting severe jaundice, acholic stools, prominent hepatomegaly, severe inflammation on liver biopsy and familial occurrence. Numerous inherited disorders causing the neonatal hepatitis syndrome have recently been described in terms of gene defect, such as the bile canalicular transporter disorders and bile acid synthesis disorders, and these had previously been classified as idiopathic neonatal hepatitis. Undoubtedly, other such disorders remain to be defined. A hereditary form with giant cell transformation and lymphoedema resulting from abnormal deep lymphatics has been reported, but the gene abnormality has not yet been determined. 30, 31 Another identified aetiology is adenosine deaminase deficiency, with recovery after enzyme replacement. 32 Citrullinaemia type 2 due to deficiency of citrin can cause neonatal hepatitis syndrome (then also known as NICCD, neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency [33] [34] [35] [36] ; it may occur in ethnicities other than East Asian.

Associated macrovesicular steatosis favours a metabolic disorder. Confluent hepatocyte necrosis or loss with bridging collapse is seen in the rare patients presenting with acute-pattern neonatal liver failure or having a subacute clinical course associated with perinatal haemochromatosis, non-Wilsonian copper toxicosis or other metabolic disorders such as hereditary tyrosinaemia type 1.

The cytoplasm of some giant cells may contain remnants of cell membranes. It is partially rarefied and often contains bile and/or haemosiderin. The cells may have more glycogen than normal hepatocytes and a greater activity of a variety of enzymes, such as glucose-6-phosphatase, acid phosphatase and succinic dehydrogenase. Death of the giant cells is associated with a neutrophilic inflammatory response (Fig. 3.3) . In severe forms, extensive bridging cell loss may divide the parenchyma into micronodules which are highlighted by a reticulin stain (Fig. 3.4 A and B ). The number of giant cells decreases as patients grow older and are rare after age 1 year. Formation of giant cells is considered to be a characteristic change resulting from mitotic inhibition of the young, growing liver tissue by a number of agents, such as viruses, drugs hepatitis syndrome, conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is invariably present.

The term 'neonatal cholestasis' is not precise because in the first 3-4 months of life, every infant has some degree of cholestasis physiologically. This physiological cholestasis occurs because mechanisms for uptake of bile acids and other organic anions by hepatocytes are immature and thus inefficient, leading to high concentrations of bile acids in blood. In addition, hepatocellular pathways for bile acid conjugation and biliary secretion are also immature, in part because bile canalicular transporters are also regulated developmentally. The circulating bile acid pool is contracted, and ileal uptake of bile acids is underdeveloped. The term 'neonatal hepatitis' is obviously imprecise because hepatic inflammation is not a feature of every condition. 'Neonatal hepatitis syndrome' emphasizes the uniformity of the clinical presentation and similarity of pathological findings, as well as the broad spectrum of causative disease processes. The term 'infantile conjugated bilirubinaemia disorders' (ICBRDs) not only identifies the definitional finding but conveys inclusion of a broad spectrum of infectious, metabolic, structural and other aetiologies. It suffers only from being linguistically unwieldy.",

An unusually high incidence of CMV infection (49%) was reported in a series of 45 cases from Taiwan. 18 HSV, enteroviruses, adenovirus and HBV may cause neonatal liver failure characterised by an acute pattern of liver disease, with extremely elevated serum aminotransferases. In addition to genetic metabolic disorders, endocrine disorders may cause neonatal hepatitis syndrome. An association with hypopituitarism was reported in two infants by Herman et al., 19 and later Sheehan et al. 20 Immunological disorders may cause neonatal hepatitis syndrome; neonatal lupus erythematosus is most common. Most infants with the rare disorder known as 'neonatal (or perinatal) haemochromatosis' have an immunological disorder which results in neonatal liver failure with a chronic pattern (near-normal serum aminotransferases, profound coagulopathy, subnormal serum albumin), called 'gestational alloimmune liver disease' (GALD). 21 Rarely, a Coombs-positive haemolytic anaemia defines a severe form of giant cell hepatitis which rapidly progresses to cirrhosis or death. 22 Early and sustained immunosuppressive therapy may control the disease in some patients. 23 The liver lesion has been shown to recur in the allograft of the few cases transplanted. 24, 25 Infants with birth asphyxia may develop severe neonatal hepatitis syndrome. 26, 27 It may be caused by an ischaemic hepatitis. 28 Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia typically occurs at 1 week of age, lasts 3-4 months, and the hepatomegaly and liver tests return to normal by 1 year of age.

Initially, the extrahepatic biliary tree is affected, evident as an obstructive picture both clinically and histopathologically; this is the defining lesion of this disorder. Biliary cirrhosis develops early in life. The children who survive infancy because of a successful Kasai portoenterostomy continue to have intrahepatic bile duct damage, which leads eventually to profound loss of small intrahepatic bile ducts and recurrent cholestasis due to bile duct paucity. Accordingly, this hepatobiliary disorder is now called simply biliary atresia, without specifying an extrahepatic (or intrahepatic) location. The term 'biliary atresia' (BA) is used in this section interchangeably with the former term 'extrahepatic biliary atresia' (EHBA). The term 'intrahepatic biliary atresia' to denote intrahepatic bile duct paucity has been obsolete for many years and should be abandoned. Additionally, biliary 'atresia' must be distinguished from biliary 'agenesis' .",

            "text": "Approximately 30% of infants presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in the neonatal period have BA, the overall incidence being approximately 1 in 6000 to 1 in 19,000 live births. [45] [46] [47] [48] There is no clear-cut racial predilection, although some ethnicities appear to have a higher incidence: African-Americans 49 and Polynesians 50 compared with Caucasian infants. BA is more common in girls than boys. 47, 51 Seasonal variation in the occurrence of this disease has been suggested in North American studies, 49, 50 although this pattern has not been confirmed in Europe 45 or Japan. 52 Unquestionably, multiple disease mechanisms can produce BA because it may occur as an isolated lesion or in association with various types of congenital structural abnormalities or specific chromosomal abnormalities. It can be conceptually useful to classify BA in two general patterns: 'embryonic,' occurring early in development and accounting for 15-35% of cases, and 'perinatal/acquired', comprising 65-85% of cases. This aetiopathogenic heterogeneity of BA was first delineated by a study of 237 children by Silveira et al. 53 Forty-seven of the children (20%) had associated congenital anomalies (28 cardiovascular, 22 digestive and 19 splenic). The splenic malformations included 13 with polysplenia syndrome and two with asplenia. Karyotypic abnormalities were found in two of eight children studied. The and hereditary abnormalities, 42 or from dissolution of cell membranes, as suggested by Craig and Landing, 43 who first described this entity. Negative nuclear staining for cell proliferation markers and the demonstration of canalicular remnants using carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) immunostaining support a fusion of rosette-forming hepatocytes as the likely mechanism of giant cell formation. 41 Phillips et al. 44 used the term 'syncytial giant cell hepatitis' to describe 10 patients (age range, 5 months to 41 years) with hepatitis characterized by giant multinucleated hepatocytes, usually containing up to 30 nuclei within a single large cell body. These large cells conformed to the reticular framework of the hepatic cords but in some cases crossed the sinusoids to form syncytial masses with adjacent cords. The authors concluded that these large cells were the product of fusion of hepatocytes (thus the term 'syncytial'), most likely caused by paramyxovirus infection. extrahepatic biliary atresia, and oesophageal and duodenal atresia was reported in one family; description of the findings suggests agenesis of the extra-and intrahepatic ducts. 70 Viral infection in combination with a genetic predisposition to a robust or disordered inflammatory response may play a role in the development of perinatal/acquired BA. Chance occurrence of a viral infection during a limited period of susceptibility would explain the rarity of BA. No consensus exists as to which viruses are pre-eminent in such an aetiopathogenesis. The proposed viruses form a heterogeneous group, including both DNA and RNA viruses. Some recent observations suggest that viral infection is a secondary phenomenon. 71 CMV infection is found in a high proportion of children with BA. Accordingly, a recent classification of BA specifies CMV association not only in the perinatal form, but also in the embryonic form and cystic variant. 72 Tarr et al. 73 found evidence for viral infection in 5 of 23 patients with BA. The diagnosis was based on histopathological evidence of CMV infection, serology (IgM antibodies) or culture. The detection of CMV infection by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is higher in neonatal hepatitis than in BA. 74 In a set of identical twins both infected with CMV, one twin had BA and the other had neonatal hepatitis. 75 Infants with BA and concurrent CMV infection may have a worse prognosis. 76 CMV may elicit immune responses, which interfere with the action of regulatory T (Treg) cells. 77 Reovirus 3 was suggested as a cause of BA and neonatal hepatitis on the basis of clinical and experimental studies, [78] [79] [80] [81] but this association was questioned by other investigators. 82, 83 Tyler et al. 84 provided more compelling evidence for an aetiological association between BA and reoviruses, detecting reovirus RNA from hepatobiliary tissues of 55% of patients with BA and 78% of patients with choledochal cysts. Riepenhoff-Talty et al. 85 suggested a possible relationship between group C rotavirus and BA. Subsequently, however, no evidence of group A, B or C rotaviruses was detected by PCR in BA. 86 Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been detected in neonatal hepatitis and BA by nested PCR for DNA, 87 but the role, if any, of HPV needs to be clarified.",

Discordance for BA in HLA identical twins supports a postnatal event being of primary importance in the pathogenesis of perinatal/acquired BA. 54 By contrast, approximately 10-30% of infants with BA have extrahepatic congenital abnormalities such as polysplenia, left atrial isomerism, double-sided left lung, preduodenal portal vein, intestinal malrotation and/or congenital heart defects. 51, 55, 56 Preduodenal portal vein is the result of a variation in the normal developmental pattern of the embryonic precursors of the portal vein, i.e. the right and left vitelline veins and their three anastomotic channels. These congenital defects are sometimes grouped as a 'laterality complex' . Abnormalities of the spleen are not invariably present in infants who have other typical features of the laterality complex, and thus 'splenic disorder' does not define this association. 57 The best currently available term for this category of BA is 'biliary atresia with structural malformations' (BASM).",

Exceptionally, the cystic change is confined to intrahepatic ducts. This type of BA, now termed 'cystic' BA (formerly called 'correctable' BA), may be identified on sonography of the fetus in approximately 40% of affected cases. 60 It may represent yet another disease mechanism for BA, distinct from those represented by embryonic and perinatal BA, although cystic BA has been identified in patients with embryonic BA. Notably, some infants with BA have specific chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy [17] [18] 61 Turner syndrome 62 or cat-eye syndrome. 63 BA has been reported with the Kabuki make-up syndrome, 64 in one patient with Zimmermann-Laband syndrome and brachydactyly 65 and in Martinas-Frias syndrome. 66 Other genetic disorders may be associated with BA because familial occurrence has been reported, 67, 68 and in one case a woman who previously had BA gave birth to a daughter with BA. 69 A lethal autosomal recessive syndrome with intrauterine growth retardation, once called intra-and human disease. IFN-\u03b3 plays an important role in bile duct damage: knockout mice not expressing IFN-\u03b3 failed to incur severe duct damage after infection with RRV despite a brief hepatitis, whereas wild-type animals did; administration of recombinant IFN-\u03b3 abrogated the protective effect of not being able to produce IFN-\u03b3. 113 Certain chemokines may also contribute to biliary damage 114 ; IL-12 seems to play a lesser role 115 ; TNF\u03b1 appears not to be involved. 116 Recent observations implicate IL-17, which plays a role in various autoimmune disorders. 117 In this mouse model, primed neonatal CD8 T cells appear capable of initiating damage to bile ducts. 118 When T cells from RRVdisease mice were transferred into naive syngeneic severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, the recipients developed bile ductspecific inflammation without previous RRV infection. 119 Some autoantibodies have been detected in this model (directed to \u03b1-enolase or vimentin). 92 Thus the combination of observations in infants with BA and in this mouse model strongly suggests that a complex pattern of immune reactivity appears to be important in perinatal/acquire BA. Of interest, circulating markers of inflammation persist after surgical palliation with the Kasai portoenterostomy, although it is not clear why. 120 In embryonic BA, other genes may play a more direct role.",

            "text": "Other theories have been proposed for the pathogenesis of BA. Landing 121 first proposed that neonatal hepatitis, BA, infantile choledochal cyst and possibly some cases of 'intrahepatic biliary atresia' (meaning congenital duct paucity syndromes) are all manifestations of a single basic disease process that he named 'infantile obstructive cholangiopathy' . He considered BA (and choledochal cyst) to be the result of an inflammatory rather than a maldevelopmental process and postulated that the most probable cause was a viral infection. Since the aetiopathogenesis of an important congenital bile duct paucity syndrome, namely, Alagille syndrome, has since been elucidated as genetic, this theory clearly requires modification. Nevertheless, as previously discussed, the role of viral infection, at least in the pathogenesis of perinatal/acquired BA, is an important focus of current research. Certain chromosomal abnormalities may give rise to complex syndromes, including altered immune reactivity, and thus predispose to hepatobiliary disease mediated by viral infection. Microchimerism has recently been proposed as part of the mechanism of hepatobiliary damage in BA 122 ; it might initiate an immune response in the absence of viral infection. The various manifestations of infantile obstructive cholangiopathy may depend on the timing of the insult. Specifically, rats given the drug 1,4-phenylenediisothiocyanate during fetal life developed stenotic or atretic bile ducts caused by thickening and fibrosis, whereas those given the drug after birth had dilation of the ducts with inflammation. 123 It is difficult to generalize from this rat model to human infants. BA with features of the ductal plate malformation (DPM) might reflect a different disease mechanism. 124 Recent observations, however, have argued against the presence of DPM in BA as unique to patients with embryonic BA. 125 Whereas the pathogenesis of perinatal/acquired BA probably involves immunogenetic susceptibility and exposure to an instigating factor, such as viral infection, during a limited period of susceptibility, the aetiopathogenesis of embryonic BA appears to be much more diverse. An important subset has BASM (biliary atresia with structural malformations). Extrahepatic congenital abnormalities such as polysplenia, congenital heart defects and disturbed rotation of the intestines suggest an extensive and early developmental abnormality. Some infants with BASM show features of the ductal plate lesion on liver biopsy. 124, 126, 127 This abnormal configuration of small bile ducts is attributed to disorganization in the fetal development of the biliary tree; failure of remodelling of the ductal plate leads to residual embryonic bile duct structures in this rather striking configuration. Finding the ductal plate lesion in extrahepatic BA is consistent with a destructive hepatobiliary process beginning early in gestation. Abnormal cilia have been reported in children with the polysplenia infection is gone. This proposed mechanism entails an active, ongoing immune response, which can be documented empirically, and it accounts for the conflicting reports of viral infection in BA as well as the absence of detectable ongoing viral infection in liver or biliary tissue from BA patients. Currently, it is seen as involving macrophages and dendritic cells primed as a result of the infection, followed by activation of natural killer (NK) cells, which then actuate biliary epithelial damage. Amplification of the immune response by T cells and proinflammatory cytokines then takes place. 90, 91 Molecular mimicry may play a role. 92 This general disease mechanism is based on findings in human tissue from BA patients and also on disease models of BA. The hepatic inflammatory infiltrate in BA was found remarkable for evidence of lymphocyte activation. 93 Studies in liver tissue from infants with BA showed a T-helper cell type 1 (Th1) form of cytokine expression pattern with CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, CD68+ macrophages in portal tracts and increased interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-12, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1). 94 Determinants on the activated T cells are typical of an oligoclonal expansion, consistent with being evoked by a specific antigen. 95 The rarity of BA raises the possibility of genetic susceptibility in perinatal/acquired BA. Genomic studies of liver from infants with BA have shown upregulation of genes involved in regulating lymphocyte differentiation, mainly of those with Th1 commitment. 96 Upregulated expression of IFN-\u03b3 and osteopontin was notable. Subsequently, upregulation of osteopontin expression in intrahepatic biliary epithelium was found to correlate with portal fibrosis and ductular reaction. 97 A different genomic study, which included somewhat older patients, also found upregulation of genes involved in morphogenesis, cell signalling and regulation of gene transcription. 98 Further studies suggested that the pattern of regulatory gene expression in perinatal/acquired BA is not equivalent to that in embryonic BA; however, these data also failed to show a pattern of gene expression relating to laterality genes in embryonic BA. 99 Both forms of BA appear to induce a strong immunological response.",

            "text": "Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) studies in BA might support a disease mechanism involving autoimmunity, but results to date are contradictory. One early study showed that infants with perinatal/ acquired BA have a high prevalence of the HLA-B12 determinant compared both to normal controls and to infants with BA plus congenital anomalies 107 ; haplotypes A9-B5 and A28-B35 were more common in infants with late-pattern (perinatal/acquired) BA. A subsequent study failed to confirm any characteristic HLA pattern in BA. 108 However, additional studies have shown an association with HLA-DR2 109 and with HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3. 110 Further insight into the possible mechanism of perinatal/acquired BA has come from recent work in the Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) murine model of BA. It can be simulated in Balb/c-mice which have been infected with rotavirus. 111, 112 This model shares many features with the of the radiolabelled substance into the intestinal tract over a 24-hour period. This is the 'nondraining hepatobiliary scan' . Although hepatobiliary scanning has high sensitivity, scanning may appear normal if performed very early in the disease process in late-pattern BA. 146, 147 Hepatobiliary scanning is informative if it shows that tracer, and thus bile, reaches the intestine; it is objective, recorded, and can be quantified. A negative or nondraining scan does not mean that the disorder is necessarily BA, because nondraining hepatobiliary scans may be found with severe idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, small duct paucity syndromes (e.g. Alagille syndrome), severe \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency or TPNassociated cholestasis. The role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) remains controversial: ERCP is technically feasible in infants and may be useful in select cases. [148] [149] [150] Percutaneous liver biopsy is essential and has high diagnostic specificity in the range of 60-95%, depending on the timing of the biopsy, adequacy of the specimen and expertise of the pathologist. 151, 152 In our experience, the majority of nondiagnostic biopsy specimens are taken within the first few weeks of life. In fact, incidental liver biopsy specimens taken at laparotomy for duodenal stricture within the first week of life in three infants with BA showed only trivial liver abnormalities. 153 This may imply that although bile duct destruction is likely to have started in utero, the actual liver damage may not occur until the placenta no longer provides clearance of biliary products, in particular bile salts.",

            "text": "Portoenterostomy (Kasai procedure) was introduced in 1959 and remains the only potentially corrective procedure for BA, other than liver transplantation. 154 In this operation, the atretic biliary tree is resected, and bile drainage is re-established through a broad anastomosis at the end of an intestinal Roux-en-Y loop to the bare edge of the transected porta hepatis. The efficacy of the laparoscopic version of the Kasai portoenterostomy, introduced in the past 10 years, remains uncertain. Although meta-analysis has suggested that it is inferior to the traditional portoenterostomy, 155 other reports suggest favourable results, partly dependent on local expertise. 156, 157 Extensive retrospective studies have shown that the prognosis for a good long-term result from the conventional Kasai procedure depends primarily on operation before 60 days of age and the absence of cholangitis. 8, 47, [158] [159] [160] [161] [162] [163] The potential exists, however, for reasonable medium-term survival in about one-third of infants coming to primary corrective surgery at 100 days or older. Most centres continue to favour the Kasai procedure as the first therapeutic option, rather than subjecting patients to immediate liver transplantation simply on the basis of age. 164 The lack of significant fibrosis at operation may play a role in a good long-term outcome. 165 Computerized quantification of fibrosis on liver biopsy obtained at portoenterostomy may discriminate between negligible fibrosis and sufficient fibrosis to portend a poor prognosis. 166 One group suggested that histological features on the initial liver biopsy specimen can predict the success of portoenterostomy. 167 Another group reported that the extent of ductular reaction, based on keratin 7 (K7) immunostaining, found in the liver biopsy specimen obtained at the Kasai procedure was predictive of native liver survival over the following year. 168 Histological studies of the extrahepatic bile ducts removed at surgery have been performed by several groups of investigators. [169] [170] [171] [172] [173] In a study of 98 cases, Gautier and Eliot classified the biliary remnants into three types. In the first the duct is completely atretic, with few or no inflammatory cells in the surrounding connective tissue (Fig. 3.5 A) . In the second type the duct is present as a cleft-like lumen lined by occasional cuboidal or low columnar epithelium which is variably necrotic, hyperplastic or focally absent (Fig. 3 .5 B and C). The altered ducts are sometimes very numerous, usually having lumina of <50 \u00b5m; periluminal neutrophilic infiltration is syndrome and BA. 128, 129 Although the association with abnormal cilia is unclear, ciliary function appears to be important in left/right asymmetry. 130 There is a pathogenic role for multiple defects in the laterality sequence. 131 Early studies focused on the inversion (inv) gene, one of three genes that control left/right asymmetry in the mouse. 132 Beginning in early embryonic development, the liver is a predominant site for this gene expression. A transgenic mouse with recessive deletion of inv develops situs inversus and jaundice; the early fetal lesion is a complete obstruction with cystic change of the biliary tree. 133 Few of the various genes which have been found mutated in human laterality disorders (ZIC3, CFC1, LEFTYA, ACVR2B, NODAL) have been investigated in BA; however, mutations in CFC1 134 and ZIC3 135 have been found in infants with BA and major laterality defects. Three children were described with ultrastructural abnormalities of the canalicular microvilli and no expression of villin; phenotypically they had BA without laterality complex or DPM. 136 The extrahepatic biliary tree in BA may be totally atretic, or the atresia may involve only proximal or distal segments. The intrahepatic bile ducts are gradually destroyed with progression of the disease. Most infants with BA have conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia from an early age, 137 but clinical jaundice is not always apparent or appreciated. Indeed, in many infants, jaundice is initially physiological and merges with the jaundice of advancing liver disease. Infants typically have dark urine and pale stools, but the stools may retain enough colour to be falsely reassuring. The infants look well and generally gain weight adequately. At clinical presentation they have hepatomegaly and usually some degree of splenomegaly, unless polysplenia is present. The infant who presents with congenital heart disease and conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia requires intensive evaluation because the leading hepatic diagnoses will be BA or Alagille syndrome. Untreated BA rapidly progresses to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis with all the complications of portal hypertension, in addition to malnutrition and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency. The median age of death is 12 months if BA is not diagnosed and treated. 138 Early diagnosis and treatment may be promoted by the use of stool colour cards for all infants at discharge from the newborn nursery. 139, 140 Clinically, the differential diagnosis is the broad spectrum of disorders constituting the neonatal hepatitis syndrome 141 presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (see Table 3 .1). Congenital infection should be excluded, although CMV may be found along with BA. Systemic bacterial infection should be ruled out, including a silent urinary tract infection. Inherited metabolic diseases require specific attention, especially \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency, which can be associated with severe cholestasis and acholic stools and very rarely has been associated with BA. Cystic fibrosis can generate a duct lesion indistinguishable clinically from BA. These two conditions as well as galactosaemia may produce a histological picture closely resembling that of BA. Structural abnormalities of the extrahepatic biliary tree cause the clinical presentation similar to BA: choledocholithiasis, idiopathic perforation of the biliary tract, 142-144 true choledochal cyst and extrahepatic biliary hypoplasia or 'hair-like' bile duct syndrome. Some infants with Alagille syndrome show ductular reaction, rather than duct paucity, on liver biopsy taken early in the course of the disease. Whether some infants with perinatal/acquired BA have an unusually slow progression of liver disease, sometimes called 'BA in evolution', is disputed, but these patients pose a diagnostic challenge and require repeated assessment. 145 Preoperative diagnosis relies on demonstrating the presence or absence of bile secretion in the intestine. Hepatic sonography may reveal a dilated extrahepatic biliary tree, consistent with distal cystic atresia, but it is unusual to find dilated intrahepatic bile ducts. Hepatobiliary scanning, using a technetium 99m-labelled iminodiacetic acid derivative such as DISIDA or PIPIDA, fails to demonstrate passage of which effectiveness in bypassing the atretic duct is uncertain; anastomoses between ramified peribiliary glands are well demonstrated in normal adult livers using injection techniques (see Chapter 9) . Correlations between the size and number of residual ducts and establishment of bile flow after surgery have yielded conflicting results. Two groups of investigators believed that bile flow is most likely to occur when the diameter of the residual ducts exceeds 150 \u00b5m. 158, 169, 174 However, another study of the extrahepatic biliary remnants of 204 cases of BA showed that the patterns of bile duct obliteration are not indicative of prognosis. 173 Although the Kasai procedure is essentially a palliative operation, many children enjoy prolonged good health afterward, and approximately 20-25% of patients who undergo portoenterostomy will survive into adulthood without liver transplantation. Approximately 30-35% of patients drain bile but develop complications of cirrhosis and require liver transplantation before age 10 years. 175 For the remaining patients, characteristic; and cellular debris, and less often bile, may be found in the lumen. Epithelial necrosis is evident in ducts with a diameter exceeding 300 \u00b5m. The third type of biliary remnants consists of altered bile duct incompletely lined by columnar epithelium, in addition to numerous smaller epithelial structures (Fig. 3.5 D) . These histological types were evaluated by Gautier et al. 171 at three levels: porta hepatis, junction of the cystic and common hepatic ducts and an intermediate level; completely atretic duct becomes increasingly more common from the porta hepatis to the junction of the hepatic duct and cystic ducts. This classification, which may help pathologists describe the changes observed in the biliary remnants removed at portoenterostomy, is of limited clinical significance because in individual cases, serial sectioning often shows atretic ducts alternating randomly with variably destroyed ducts. In addition, the numerous smaller structures intermingled with variably altered ducts are likely to represent anastomosing channels recruited from peribiliary glands, Kasai procedure.

Note the large fibrotic and seemingly stretched portal areas which contain well-identifiable bile duct branches (yellow and light green).",

At first the liver is enlarged and dark green in colour, becoming finely nodular as cirrhosis develops ( Fig. 3.6 ). In untreated cases, the cirrhosis may take between 1 and 6 months from birth to develop. Dilated bile ducts filled with inspissated bile may be seen in sections of large portal areas ( Fig. 3.7) . The cystically dilated bile ducts may resemble Caroli disease. 182 They only occur after age 3 months and are not amenable to surgical drainage procedures. There may be portal lymphadenopathy. The median maximum node dimension in six cases studied by H\u00fcbscher and Harrison 183 was 14 mm. These lymph nodes are brown in colour and full of pigment-laden macrophages. Livers removed at transplantation after an apparently successful Kasai procedure (loss of jaundice), but with subsequent development of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, are often coarsely nodular with areas of macronodular hypertrophy and broad intervening or peripherally located scars resembling the gross appearance of focal nodular hyperplasia ( Fig. 3.8 ).",

            "text": "The histological features of BA include cholestasis, portal tract expansion by oedematous fibroplasia and periportal ductular reaction with the presence of bile plugs in dilated lumens of cholangioles that are distorted and often form an irregularly anastomosing network at the portal periphery (Figs 3.9 and 3.10). Arterial branches are unusually prominent, and portal vein branches appear attenuated. Giant cell transformation of hepatocytes is seen in some cases ( Fig. 3.11 ) and may occasionally be prominent. Loose fibrosis is progressive and periportal/perilobular in location, with linkage of portal areas and eventual development of a secondary biliary cirrhosis ( Fig. 3.12) . In a study of the extracellular and cellular components of the connective tissue matrix in BA, de Freitas et al. 184 suggested that activation of a connective tissue cellular clone by the reactive ductules may be responsible for the portal fibroplasia. Ho et al. 185 reported an arteriopathy (hyperplasia and hypertrophy) of the common hepatic artery and its peripheral branches supplying the entire biliary tree in 11 cases of biliary atresia. Thickening of the medial layer of small hepatic arteries may be present. 186 Subsequent studies have indicated that the transcription factor HNF6 plays an important role in intrahepatic bile duct and arterial development. 187, 188 HNF6 and HNF1\u00df appear necessary for ductal plate formation. 187 Large perihilar bile ducts may show ulceration with loss of epithelial lining, bile impregnation of the wall and bile sludge formation in the lumen. In addition to the severe cholestasis, the cirrhotic stage of BA is characterized by marked pseudoxanthomatous transformation, the presence of bile lakes, Mallory-Denk bodies and variable accumulation of copper and copper-associated protein in liver cells (Figs 3.13 and 3.14). In one study, copper concentrations were increased in more than two-thirds of liver samples obtained during portoenterostomy and decreased in some patients after successful biliary drainage. 189 However, copper deposition in liver is elevated in the first 2 months of life, and periportal deposition of copper on liver biopsy specimens does not discriminate extrahepatic from intrahepatic causes of cholestasis in early infancy. Acute and chronic inflammation is noted in portal/periportal areas in BA in both precirrhotic and cirrhotic stages, and bile duct degeneration and inflammation may be evident (Fig. 3.15 ). The mononuclear infiltrate in portal and lobular areas of livers with end-stage BA is similar to normal adult liver and very different from that associated with autoimmune hepatitis or chronic HBV infection. It is particularly prominent in cases associated with CMV infection. 190 The growth of large, perihilar regenerative nodules, probably as a consequence of functioning intrahepatic ducts in this region, may be important for maintaining biliary drainage after Kasai procedure. 191 Bile lakes occur after age 3 months, by which time irreversible hepatic damage has occurred. 192 Interlobular bile ducts become few in number as early as the fourth or fifth month after birth (Fig. 3.16) , and advanced duct loss accompanies progressive fibrosis by age 8 or 9 months. 121 Activated hepatic stellate cells are responsible for increased collagen production. 193, 194 In addition to paucity of ducts, Raweily et al. 127 identified concentric tubular ductal structures in 21.6% of cases of BA; these bore some resemblance to those seen in ductal plate malformations ( Fig. 3.17) . Similar observations had been made earlier by Desmet and Callea, 195 who hypothesized that this subgroup has more severe and rapidly progressive liver damage. Interestingly, children in this subgroup reveal a histopathological picture resembling that of congenital hepatic fibrosis 4 or 5 years after portoenterostomy 195, 196 (Fig. 3.18 ; see also Fig. 3.17) . The interlobular bile ducts continue to disappear, and cirrhosis can develop despite satisfactory bile drainage after portoenterostomy. The bile duct loss has been attributed to persistent interference with bile flow, 197 recurrent cholangitis or continuation of the immune process causing the atresia. Detailed histopathological study of sequential liver specimens taken at Kasai operation, relaparotomy and/or transplantation has provided evidence that the bile duct loss is caused by an unpredictable and uneven obliteration of bile ducts in the porta hepatis during wound healing and scarring after portoenterostomy. 197 Ultrastructural degenerative changes affecting the intrahepatic bile ducts and ductules in BA have been described in detail by Ito et al., 198 who found that the degree of obstruction of the lumen of syndrome, 208 trisomy 17-18, trisomy 21 209 and prune-belly syndrome, 210 may have duct paucity. More importantly, the term nonsyndromic duct paucity may be used to refer to isolated, idiopathic paucity of interlobular bile ducts in infancy and childhood; this condition may be the same as idiopathic adulthood ductopenia. Finally, paucity of the intrahepatic ducts or ductopenia is frequently found as a late feature of certain chronic diseases, such as BA, primary sclerosing cholangitis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis and primary biliary cirrhosis (see Chapter 9).",

            "text": "Patients in the syndromic group have Alagille syndrome (ALGS), also known as arteriohepatic dysplasia. 211 Comprehensive descriptions have been reported by Alagille and colleagues 212, 213 and others. [214] [215] [216] Two distinct genetic mechanisms are known to be responsible for ALGS. Most cases (ALGS1) are caused by mutations in JAGGED1 (JAG1, encoding the ligand for the Notch 1 receptor) on chromosome 20p12, 217, 218 and may be associated with a macroscopic deletion of the short arm of chromosome 20 in some patients or microdeletions of 20p in others. The pattern of genetic transmission is autosomal dominant due to haploinsufficiency or dominant negative effect 218 ; gene penetrance is high, but expression is extremely variable. 219 The reported incidence of arteriohepatic dysplasia as 1 in 70,000 live births was an underestimate, and it is actually 1 in 30,000. 216 Approximately 50-70% of patients have new mutations, rather than genetic transmission within the family. Crosnier et al. 220 found mutations of the JAG1 gene in 69 of 109 patients (63%) with ALGS, and transmission analysis showed a high frequency of sporadic cases (70%). Numerous mutations have now been defined. 221 The common clinical findings in Alagille syndrome include cholestatic liver disease caused by paucity of the intrahepatic bile ducts (94%); congenital heart disease, usually peripheral pulmonary stenosis, although complex congenital heart disease, usually right sided, may occur (92%); a typical facies (91%); posterior embryotoxon in the eye (80-93%) and butterfly-shaped vertebral arch deficits (40-67%). 215 The facies of ALGS consists of an inverted triangle shape, slight hypertelorism, deep-set eyes, broad and rather prominent forehead, and beak-like nose. Although the specificity of the facies has been questioned, 222 it is accepted as a typical finding, 223 better appreciated in the actual clinical setting than in photographs. The facies is sometimes not evident in the first months of life, and in adults the facies is somewhat different from that described in children (longer face, rather coarse features, prominent forehead and comparatively small nose). Most patients have a systolic murmur related to stenosis of the pulmonary arterial system. More severe conditions include tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary valve stenosis, aortic stenosis, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, anomalous pulmonary venous return and complex problems involving a single right ventricle with pulmonary valve atresia. 224, 225 Up to 15% of patients may have life-threatening cardiac complications. 213 In addition to posterior embryotoxon or Axenfeld anomaly, abnormal retinal pigmentation may be found. 226 Strabismus, ectopic pupil, and hypotrophic optic discs have also been reported. Optic disc drusen, which are calcified deposits in the extracellular space of the optic nerve head, often occur in Alagille syndrome. These can be found by ocular ultrasound examination and may facilitate the diagnosis. 227 In addition to 'butterfly vertebrae' (vertebral sagittal cleft), other skeletal abnormalities include short distal phalanges and clinodactyly, and ALGS patients may be prone to bone fractures, beyond what might be attributed to chronic cholestatic liver disease. [228] [229] [230] [231] Systems other than those in the cardinal criteria for the syndrome may be affected. Renal abnormalities may be prominent; renal these ducts appears to be an important determinant of prognosis following corrective surgery.",

The relevant finding is a reduction in the number of interlobular bile ducts, that is, in the small bile ducts within portal tracts. The normal ratio of small bile ducts per portal tract in full-term infants, children and adults is 0.9-1.8 ducts per tract. In duct paucity syndromes, this ratio is <0.5, given an adequate number of portal tracts (at least 10) examined on biopsy. Herman et al. 206 have proposed the use of IHC for K7 and EMA to help calculate the ratio between interlobular bile ducts and neocholangioles, with a low ratio indicating bile duct paucity. Premature infants have a reduced number of small bile ducts per portal tract, and if they have duct paucity with cholestasis, it may be physiological. In addition, early biopsy specimens in a few cases of clinically undisputed paucity of the intrahepatic bile ducts have shown not only identifiable ducts, but significant ductular reaction as well.",

Chromosomal defects, such as 45,XO Turner Catch-up growth after LT is variable. 256, 257 Long-term complications of Alagille syndrome not requiring LT have included renal failure and intracranial bleeding or stroke. 215, 247, 249 Hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported in children and adults with ALGS. [258] [259] [260] [261] Although rare, hepatic malignancy may occur in ALGS infants.",

            "text": "Histopathological aspects of Alagille syndrome are described in various reports and reviews. 212, 213, 245, [262] [263] [264] [265] [266] [267] [268] The major finding is absence of bile ducts from portal areas (Figs 3.19 and 3.20) . The ratio of interlobular bile ducts to the number of portal areas is between 0.0 and 0.4, compared with 0.9-1.8 in normal children. A reduced number of portal areas has been noted. 262 The loss of bile ducts is progressive from early infancy to childhood. 215, 245, [267] [268] [269] Cholangiodestructive lesions have been observed in infants between 3 and 6 months of age. 245, 268 The degree of cholestasis is variable in intensity and is especially prominent in the first 12 months of life. Immunohistochemical staining for endopeptidase (CD10) is typically absent from the canalicular surface in ALGS children. 270 Endopeptidase, however, is not expressed physiologically until about 7 years of age, 270 as well as during fibrosis progression in various liver disorders. 271 Giant cell transformation of hepatocytes may be seen in early infancy. 245, 267, 268 There is usually patchy pseudoxanthomatous change and accumulation of stainable copper and copper-associated protein dysplasia with or without cysts is most common. 232 Renal tubular acidosis may be found, 216 and vesicoureteral reflux is also a frequent finding. Renovascular hypertension may develop. Single horseshoe kidney has been reported. The most frequent histological finding is mesangiolipidosis, 233 and other findings include tubulointerstitial nephropathy and membranous nephropathy. Nephrolithiasis may occur. Two children with ALGS and nephroblastoma were reported. 234 Renal impairment in ALGS detected before liver transplantation does not improve spontaneously after liver transplant and mandates consideration of 'renal-sparing' immunosuppression. Systemic vascular disease appears to be more prevalent than originally appreciated. Several cases of moyamoya disease in association with ALGS have been reported. [235] [236] [237] The propensity to intracranial bleeding found in the first few years of life in ALGS may be caused by abnormal intracranial vessels. [238] [239] [240] Abnormalities in the large intraabdominal vessels have been found, and these abnormalities may complicate liver transplantation. 237, 241 Skin changes relate mainly to formation of xanthomas, which regress after successful liver transplantation. 242 Abnormalities of the biliary tract include hypoplasia of the extrahepatic bile ducts, [243] [244] [245] [246] [247] hypoplasia of the gallbladder 229 and cholelithiasis. 242 ERCP has demonstrated narrowing of the intrahepatic ducts, reduced arborization and focal areas of dilation, as well as narrowing of the extrahepatic ducts. [243] [244] [245] Portal venous disease may also be present, specifically hypoplasia of the portal vein. 248 Many patients develop growth retardation before adolescence, 249,250 especially if they have persisting clinical jaundice. Short stature is found in some affected children whose nutrition is normal. Although some display a degree of mental retardation, in general children with ALGS show a broad range of cognitive and intellectual ability. Almost all patients have pruritus, although it may be mild. They have elevated serum bile acids; cholic acid levels are greater than chenodeoxycholic acid levels. Variable hyperlipidaemia (sometimes severe, with xanthomas) is common. Treatments for the pruritus include cholestyramine, rifampicin or surgical diversion of bile flow. 216, 251 In general, the prognosis is good for children whose jaundice resolves; however, approximately 25% of patients succumb in childhood to severe cardiac disease or progressive liver disease. The outcome in 92 patients in the series of Emerick et al. 215 was as follows: the 20-year predicted life expectancy was 75% for all patients, 80% for those not requiring liver transplantation (LT) and 60% for those who required LT. LT has been reserved for patients with chronic liver failure, intolerable pruritus unresponsive to medical treatment and severe growth failure. LT for hepatic decompensation was necessary in 19 of 92 cases (21%), with 79% alive 1 year after transplantation; mortality was 17%. In the Bic\u00eatre series of 163 patients followed over 40 years, 102 of 132 patients presenting with cholestatic jaundice in infancy remained jaundiced at the study endpoint, and one-third required LT; cirrhosis was found in some children with ALGS, but no neonatal hepatitis syndrome, and none underwent LT (two succumbing to end-stage liver disease before the advent of LT). 249 Overall survival in this series was 62% at 20 years and seemed unaffected by availability of LT. 249 Mortality is higher among patients who have more severe cardiac disease or intracranial bleeding, or who had previously undergone portoenterostomy. 252, 253 A retrospective study suggested that affected preschool-aged children with total serum bilirubin >111 \u00b5mol/L, serum conjugated bilirubin >77 \u00b5mol/L and serum cholesterol >13.5 mmol/L were likely to have a severe outcome, irrespective of actual JAG1 mutation. 254 LT is an option for those in end-stage liver failure, or with severe chronic cholestasis or intractable pruritus; however, severity of cardiac and renal involvement, as well as intra-abdominal vascular abnormalities, must be evaluated as contributing to increased surgical risk. 255 to human ALGS; zebrafish with knockdowns of jagged \u00b1 notch genes have biliary, pancreatic, cardiac, renal and craniofacial developmental abnormalities; these studies suggest that Notch may promote biliary epithelial cell evolution from a bipotential precursor cells. 280 In humans, mutations in JAG1 result in truncated and inactive proteins; since residual gene expression cannot compensate, there is haploinsufficiency. 221 Dose of Notch ligands is critical and may contribute to the clinical diversity of ALGS. No clear relationship between genotype and phenotype has been found, but the Delta/ Serrate/Lag-2 (DSL) domain in the JAG1 protein may influence the severity of liver disease. [281] [282] [283] A second genetic basis for Alagille syndrome (ALGS2) has been reported. 284 It accounts for a very small proportion of cases. 285 Children with mutations in the gene encoding Notch 2 (found on chromosome 1p13) have a clinical disorder similar to conventional Alagille syndrome, notably with intrahepatic duct paucity leading to cholestatic liver disease; however, the typical facies and skeletal abnormalities were much less common. Frequency of renal involvement is similar to that in ALGS1. Notch 2 appears to have an important role in bile duct development. 286, 287 ",

        {
            "text": "In contrast to patients with Alagille syndrome, those with nonsyndromic bile duct paucity do not have a constellation of extrahepatic features. Children with nonsyndromic bile duct paucity are supposed to have a less favourable outlook than children with ALGS. They present with persistent cholestasis and severe pruritus. Growth retardation is common. No associated aetiological agent, defined genetic factors or congenital anomalies have been found in this group, except for one study of 10 patients with a high rate of consanguinity. 288 A chronic cholestatic disease with duct paucity, called 'idiopathic adulthood ductopenia, ' has been described in adults. [289] [290] [291] Most of these patients are young adults, although patients over age 60 have been reported. 292 Nonsyndromatic paucity of bile ducts in infancy and idiopathic adulthood ductopenia may be related diseases. The outlook for younger patients with idiopathic adulthood ductopenia is poor; approximately 50% succumb to progressive liver disease or require transplantation. Hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported in a woman with intrahepatic biliary hypoplasia, apparently distinct from ALGS. 293 A histopathological study of 17 children with nonsyndromic paucity of bile ducts was reported by Kahn et al. 294 Before 90 days of age there was paucity of ducts and periportal fibrosis as well as nonspecific parenchymal changes (cholestasis, giant cell transformation, perisinusoidal fibrosis and haematopoiesis). After 90 days the duct paucity and fibrosis persisted but cholestasis was mild or no longer apparent. Kahn et al. 294 suggested that the paucity in nonsyndromic cases may result from a primary ductal insult with destruction and disappearance of the ducts. The differential diagnosis of paucity of the intrahepatic bile ducts in children and adults has been reviewed by West and Chatila. 295 Bile duct anomalies, congenital dilations and ductal plate malformation disorders in periportal hepatocytes. 245, 267, 268 Copper accumulation has been demonstrated by quantitative methods in both syndromic and nonsyndromic types of paucity of the intrahepatic bile ducts. 263 Periportal fibrosis is mild, and it may remain unchanged long-term, 212 possibly due to the absence of ductular reaction, known to play a role in periportal fibrogenesis. Nonetheless, although progression to cirrhosis is rare, some patients do develop extensive fibrosis or cirrhosis ( Fig. 3.21 ). Portal inflammation and periportal ductular reaction, when present, are seen mainly in early infancy and can suggest the presence of distal duct obstruction. 245, 268, 272 Ultrastructural studies of the intrahepatic bile ducts in Alagille syndrome have been reported. 265, 267, 268, 273 Bile canalicular changes are controversial. In one study of 12 biopsies from 10 patients, distinctive ultrastructural changes were noted. 265 Bile pigment retention was found in the cytoplasm of liver cells, especially in lysosomes and in vesicles of the cis-Golgi, but only rarely in bile canaliculi or the immediate pericanalicular region. It was suggested that the basic defect in ALGS involves the bile secretory apparatus. 265 The aetiopathogenesis of the cholangiodestructive lesions described histopathologically and ultrastructurally remains to be elucidated, but the possibility of 'disuse atrophy' has been raised by two groups of investigators. 265, 268 Recent studies suggest defective branching of intrahepatic bile ducts in the postnatal period. 274 Alagille syndrome is the first childhood disorder identified with a mutation in a ligand for a Notch protein. JAG1 encodes a ligand of Notch 1, one of a family of transmembrane proteins with epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like motifs. Notch proteins are highly conserved and have a role in determining cell fate during differentiation, especially in tissues where epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are important. 275 Jagged/Notch interactions are known to be critical for determination of cell fates in early development. Notch 4 expression during embryogenesis is seen in endothelial cells of vessels forming the dorsal aorta, intersegmental vessels, cephalic vessels and the heart. The expression of Notch 1 and its ligand includes many of the organs potentially abnormal in ALGS. 276 JAG1 plays an important role in embryogenesis of the heart, kidneys and blood vessels; in embryonic and fetal liver it is expressed in portal vascular tissue. Recent studies in mice indicate that Notch signalling regulates the remodelling of the ductal plate and bile duct morphogenesis, and that Jagged 1 plays an important role in this complex process. 277 Jagged 1 on ductal plate and Notch 3 on portal tract mesenchyme and hepatic arterial endothelium interact for ductal plate remodelling and development of intrahepatic bile ducts. 278, 279 Mice with defects in murine Jagged 1 and Notch 2 expression have abnormalities similar Maljunction of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system (common channel) remains the most plausible aetiopathogenic mechanism for choledochal cysts, which is supported by experimental studies. 325 The lesion is defined as a junction of the pancreatic and bile ducts located outside the duodenal wall, usually forming an extremely long common channel. The anomaly allows pancreatobiliary regurgitation because hydrostatic pressure within the pancreatic duct is usually higher than that in the CBD. As a result, high pancreatic enzyme levels are found in the bile. Common channels may occur without bile duct dilation and lead to primarily gallbladder rather than biliary complications, including malignancy. In this situation, prophylactic cholecystectomy might be sufficient, whereas biliary complications and the risk of cholangiocarcinoma underpin the need for radical surgical resection in cases associated with choledochal cysts. 322 Reovirus-3 RNA sequences have been recovered from resected choledochal cysts, 84 but the implication of reovirus infection in the aetiology of choledochal cyst is unclear. A single report of choledochal cysts in association with familial adenomatous polyposis raises the possibility of a genetic basis for the cysts. 326 Treatment is by complete cyst resection, cholecystectomy and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy as a preventive measure against the subsequent development of carcinoma. 327, 328 Laparoscopic repair has been successful in two recent series. 329, 330 Dilemmas may arise when the cysts involve the intrahepatic or intrapancreatic segments, requiring more extensive surgery, given the small risk of malignancy developing in cystic remnants at the anastomotic site or in the dilated intrahepatic bile duct of type IV or V cysts. 301, 331 In a report of 48 Japanese patients treated by total or subtotal excision, no malignant change occurred after a mean follow-up of 9.1 years. 332 Similar excellent results were reported from Finland with median follow-up of 4.8 years (range, 1.3-13.2). 299 Choledochal cysts vary greatly in size, with some larger lesions containing 5-10 litres of bile (Figs 3.22 and 3.23). Histopathologically, the wall is usually thickened by inflammation and fibrosis and is bile stained. Smooth muscle fibres may be identified in the lower portion of the cyst but not in the narrow (intrapancreatic) portion. 333 There is generally no epithelial lining, but islets of cylindrical or columnar epithelium may be preserved ( Fig. 3. 24 ). Intestinal metaplasia with mucous gland proliferation has been reported, as well as the presence of goblet and Paneth cells and neuroendocrine differentiation. 334 Types I and IV account for the majority of reported cases, although types IV and V may prevail in the Far East, where the disease occurs more frequently. Type IV cysts are more frequent in adults than in children. 297 Although this classification remains in common use, its value has been questioned by Visser et al., 298 who consider the distinction between types I and IV arbitrary; they suggest that the term 'choledochal cyst' should be reserved for congenital dilation of the extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts, with other forms referred to by their name, e.g. choledochocoele and bile duct diverticulum. Caroli disease, assimilated to type IV in Hadad classification, is not clearly related to 'choledochal cyst', given its common association with both congenital hepatic fibrosis and fibrocystic lesions in the kidney and its distinct morphological features (see next). Hukkinen et al. 299 have observed a considerable increase in the incidence of cholechal malformation in Finland.",

Up to 60% of choledochal cysts are diagnosed before age 10 years, but diagnosis can be made at any age, and some cases may present for the first time at as late as the eighth decade. 303 Several cases have been diagnosed antenatally. 304, 305 About 80% of the patients are female. Differences in presentation between children and adults with choledochal cysts have been emphasized in two large series. [306] [307] [308] The preoperative diagnosis can be made in the majority of patients by cholangiographic studies, ultrasonography (US) and isotope scanning. 309 Dynamic magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), including secretin stimulation, contributes to the understanding of the pathophysiology. 310 Complications include perforation, liver abscesses, stone formation, secondary biliary cirrhosis, pancreatitis, amyloidosis and carcinoma of the biliary tree. 300, [311] [312] [313] [314] [315] Regression of biliary cirrhosis following drainage of a choledochal cyst has been reported. 316 One patient presented with anaemia secondary to bleeding from erosions of the duodenal mucosa between the ampullary sphincter and the sphincters of the CBD and pancreatic duct. 317 Biliary tract anomalies reported in association with a choledochal cyst include double CBD, double gallbladder, absent gallbladder, annular pancreas, biliary atresia or stenosis; 318 stenoses of the intrahepatic bile ducts 319 and most frequently, anomalies of the pancreaticobiliary junction. [320] [321] [322] In a series of 104 choledochal cysts from Japan, 25% of patients were found to have coexisting biliary anomalies. 323 Differences between (1) isolated choledochal cysts and (2) choledochal cysts associated with biliary atresia have been noted by US. In the former the cysts are larger, intrahepatic ducts are dilated and the gallbladder is not atretic as compared to those with choledochal cysts and biliary atresia. 324 In general, the apparent choledochal cyst associated with BA is actually proximal duct dilation associated with focal atresia of the distal CBD, so-called correctable or cystic atresia. with an increased risk of biliary tree malignancy irrespective of the presence of cysts. 346",

They represent a spectrum of microscopic and macroscopic cystic lesions often associated with fibrocystic anomalies in the kidneys. The severity of the renal lesions may overshadow the liver disease, as in the early presentation of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. Conversely, portal hypertension with a preserved liver function may dominate the picture later in life, as exemplified by congenital hepatic fibrosis. Cholangitis may develop, especially when the cysts communicate with the biliary system. These abnormalities are classified as ductal plate malformation, 347,348 a term that refers to the histological changes of circumferentially disposed and variably ectatic bile ducts and ductules, often directly abutting the hepatocytic plates, which resemble an exuberant embryonal ductal plate. The main disorders, in particular autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), the closely associated congenital hepatic fibrosis and Caroli disease, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), are discussed in detail, whereas the rarer associated syndromes, which have been comprehensively reviewed by Knisely, 349 are briefly mentioned. Over the past decade, genes and encoded proteins for several of these disorders have been identified (Table 3 .2). The recognition that the 'cystoproteins', the mutation of which causes polycystic disease, have been localized in the primary cilia or basal bodies of tubular epithelial cells has led to a renewed interest in these forgotten structures. The clinicopathological discussion of specific disorders is therefore preceded by a short account on cilia and cystogenesis; more details and comprehensive references can be found in reviews. 350, 351 Primary disorders of cilia development or cystogenesis",

            "text": "Most studies on mechanisms of cyst development in hereditary polycystic disease have been conducted in the kidney, but there are The majority of tumours arising in congenital cystic dilations of the bile ducts are adenocarcinomas, but some anaplastic and several squamous carcinomas have been reported, [337] [338] [339] and one report mentioned sarcomatous changes. 340 The overall incidence of carcinoma arising in all cystic dilations of the bile ducts is about 3%. 338 The risk is age related, increasing from 0.7% in the first decade to 6.8% in the second decade to 14.3% in later decades. 339 This finding has been confirmed in a recent series of 36 choledochal cysts describing a high rate of biliary intraepithelial neoplasia in approximately a third of cases and adenocarcinoma in about 15%. 341 The complication is thus usually seen in adults; only three patients reviewed by Iwai et al. 342 were under 18 years of age. An 11-year-old boy is the youngest reported to date. 343 Reveille et al. 344 found that stasis of bile in the choledochal cyst contributes to bacterial overgrowth and the generation of unconjugated secondary bile acids, a possible cause of biliary metaplasia and carcinoma. Interestingly, bile from congenital choledochal cyst patients is shown to promote the proliferation of human cholangiocarcinoma QBC939 cells. 345 Certain bile acid fractions together with reflux of pancreatic enzymes may play a primary role, because pancreaticobiliary maljunction is associated mouse cpk mutation is the most extensively characterized murine model, closely resembling human ARPKD, with the exception that the B6-cpk/cpk homozygotes do not express the lesion of ductal plate malformation (DPM). However, homozygous mutants from outcrosses to some other strains express the DPM. Genetic analysis supports a loss-of-function model (two-hit model) for biliary cysts developing in an age-dependent fashion. There is no correlation between the severity of the DPM and the renal cystic disease. Expression of the biliary lesion is modulated by genetic background, and the specific biliary phenotype (DPM predominant or cyst predominant) is determined by whether loss of function of the cpk gene occurs as a germline or a somatic event. 368 In the mouse model generated by targeted mutation of Pkdh1, the animals develop severe malformation of their intrahepatic bile ducts, but develop normal kidneys. 369 The cholangiocytes maintain a proliferative state secreting transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) that continuously stimulates mesenchymal cells to synthesize and put down extracellular matrix, resulting in fibrosis. The findings suggest that fibrocystin/polyductin, already expressed in the embryonic ductal plate stage, 370 acts as a matrix sensor and signal receptor during intrahepatic bile duct development, and that its mutation results in a congenital hepatic fibrosis-like picture. 371 Its role in liver and kidney appears to be functionally divergent, because protein domains essential for bile duct development do not affect nephrogenesis in this model. 369 Hepatic features of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease",

            "text": "This PKD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The prevalence is estimated to be between 1:10,000 and 1:60,000 live births. 372 The gene for this disorder, PKHD1 (polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1), was mapped to chromosome 6p 21.2-p12 373, 374 ; both the severe and the mild form of ARPKD mapped to the same locus. 375, 376 The gene encodes a 4074-amino acid protein, called fibrocystin 377 or polyductin 378 ; this large transmembrane polypeptide, also known to localize to the cilia, 357 may be a receptor that acts in the differentiation of renal collecting duct and bile duct. An animal model is widely used. 368 In humans, there is an equal sex incidence. Depending on the age at presentation and the degree of renal involvement, Blyth and Ockenden 379 divided ARPKD into four types: perinatal, neonatal, infantile and juvenile. They proposed that four different mutant alleles are responsible, and that there may be a fifth group in which the onset of symptoms is later than juvenile. ARPKD has been reviewed by a number of authors. 124, 380, 381 The perinatal type is the most severe form; 50% of patients are diagnosed perinatally and die shortly after birth. 375 In the series of Blyth and Ockenden, 379 no infant survived beyond 6 weeks of age. The majority of patients were admitted with signs of respiratory distress and had marked abdominal distension due to huge symmetrical renal masses. Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities were uncommon. Surviving patients with the neonatal type of the disease develop gradually increasing renal insufficiency and systemic hypertension. Pyelonephritis is common. Portal fibrosis and cystic dilation of bile ducts are severe, and cholangitis is a frequent complication. In the infantile group the clinical picture is either of chronic renal failure or of increasing portal hypertension. Portal fibrosis is moderate. The juvenile group of Blyth and Ockenden 379 typically includes children (1-5 years old) who present with portal hypertension. Liver histopathological changes are marked. It is likely that this group represents cases of congenital hepatic fibrosis, as suggested by Landing et al. 382 Gang and Herrin 383 have found that ARPKD has a spectrum of phenotype expression with prognostic implications, but suggest that not all cases fit into the sharply defined subgroups of Blyth and strong suggestions that a number of pathways are common to the conversion of tubes into cysts in general, especially in the kidney tubules and hepatic bile ducts. Primary (or solitary) cilia arise from centrioles and form a finger-like extension of the cytoplasm covered with the cell membrane. In their axis, primary cilia contain a system of nine pairs of longitudinal microtubules arranged in a circle (the axoneme); in contrast, motile cilia (e.g. those in ciliated respiratory epithelium) contain a set of two centrally located microtubules within the circle of the nine pairs of longitudinal microtubules ('9+2 pattern'). The pattern typical of, and defining, primary ciliary is the '9+0 pattern' . 352 The microtubules secure the circulation of non-membrane bound macromolecules, intraflagellar transport, which is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia and also acts as a sensory process, in that the particles and associated peptides are changed in the cilium and carry a message back to the cell body. The solitary cilium is at present considered to represent a sensory antenna, functioning through the polycystin complex as a mechanotransducer. Loss of function of the complex results in perturbation of normal intracellular calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) concentration which underlies a multitude of pathological reactions. 353 Severe alterations in structure and function of tubular or ductal cells will follow involving cell-cell contact, actin cytoskeleton organization, cell-extracellular matrix interactions, cell proliferation and apoptosis. 354 An enticing finding of recent years has been the demonstration that most proteins mutated in experimental polycystic liver disease (PCLD) have been localized in the primary cilia or basal bodies of tubular epithelial cells. 355 They include those responsible for human disease, in particular polycystin 1 and polycystin 2 356 and fibrocystin/ polyductin, 357 but not the cystoproteins of isolated PCLD: hepatocystin and SEC63. 358 Mutational analysis best studied in ADPKD suggests that both germline and somatic mutations may be involved in a two-hit model, as either a prerequisite initiating event or a later somatic event needed for cyst expansion and progression. 355 Although the ciliary model is most attractive, it may represent only one of several parallel pathways that control essential cellular functions, such as proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion and differentiation. 359 Cyst epithelial lining cells show profound pathological alterations. An increased proliferation has been observed in ADPKD, comprising formation of papillary projections and overexpression of Ki-67 and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), a loss of their 'planar or tissue polarity' (the ability to sense their position and orientation relative to the overall orientation of the epithelial sheet) and a switch from an absorptive to a secretory cell type, resulting in fluid secretion that is responsible (together with epithelial proliferation) for further cyst expansion. 360 Although studies of cyst development have been mainly performed in kidney, primary cilia have been explored in cholangiocytes, 361 and evidence showed that, at least to some extent, cystogenesis in bile ducts and ductules may be similar to that in the kidney. In ADPKD, PKD1 and PKD2 are co-localized in bile duct epithelial cells 362 and the two-hit model of germ-line plus somatic mutations of PKD1 in focal liver cyst development appears applicable, as in the kidney cysts. 363 As with kidney cyst, biliary cyst expansion occurs by secretion (as well as proliferation) of the cyst lining epithelial cells. Autocrine and paracrine factors, including IL-8, epithelial neutrophil attractant 78, IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), secreted into the cystic lumen modulate the rate of errant hepatic cyst growth. 364 In ARPKD, findings suggestive of similarity with renal cystogenesis include the localization of PKHD1 in the cilia of cholangiocytes in the PCK rat, 361 which is a model for Caroli syndrome, 365 and that hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b2 (HNF1\u03b2) localized in bile duct epithelium regulates expression of PKHD1, 366 together with other 'cystoproteins' that co-localize into the cilium. 367 Differences in cystogenetic pathways between liver and kidney in ARPKD are indicated in animal models of the disease. 350 The Ockenden. In their study of 11 patients, four had 90% or more renal cystic change; these patients did not survive beyond 20 days of birth. In contrast, five of the seven less severely affected patients with a 20-75% range of cystic changes in the kidneys were all alive at 6-21 years of age. 383 The liver in ARPKD does not appear abnormal macroscopically, although it may be enlarged and firm. About 70% of patients have enlargement of the left lobe on imaging. 384 Histologically, the changes range from a persistent, circular ductal plate ( Fig. 3 .25) to a striking increase in the number of biliary channels which arise in portal areas and extend irregularly and deeply into the parenchyma (Fig. 3 .26 A). They appear to branch or 'anastomose' and often show polypoid projections ( Fig. 3.26 B) . Normal interlobular ducts with corresponding arteries are not seen. According to Witzleben, 380 the biliary channels are in continuity with the rest of the biliary system, similar to the cystic spaces of Caroli disease ('communicating' cystic disease), in contrast to the noncommunicating ADPKD. The supporting connective tissue is very scanty and, in the intralobular extensions, the basement membrane of the epithelium appears to be in direct contact with the liver cell plates. The epithelial lining consists of a single layer of low columnar to cuboidal cells. Cyst formation is uncommon. The dilated channels may contain a small quantity of a pink or orange-coloured material or rarely pus. Reconstruction studies by Adams et al. 385 have shown irregularly dilated ducts running longitudinally at the periphery of the portal tract and anastomosing so extensively that they formed a single annular channel; no main interlobular duct could be identified in that portal tract or in several others from the same liver. A stereological study of 10 cases by J\u00f6rgensen 386 showed ductal structures that could be divided into two groups: one consisted of irregular tubular structures shaped like circular cylinders, and the other of elliptical cylinders (the 'ductal plates'). These were dilated but cysts were rare. In patients who survive for months or years, there is marked fibrosis in the liver as well as kidney lesions which appear to have been progressive lesions.",

            "text": "When present, the usual renal disease in CHF is medullary tubular ectasia, a fusiform or cystic dilation of tubules (particularly the collecting ducts). Occasionally, patients have cystic kidneys typical of adult-type polycystic disease (ADPKD), an autosomal dominant disease, and others may have nephronophthisis. [394] [395] [396] [397] The prognosis in patients surviving beyond the neonatal period is generally good and depends on the extent of hepatic and renal disease. Death related to renal failure or uncontrollable variceal bleed is now the exception. 398 The combination of a patent portal vein and well-preserved liver function makes patients with CHF ideal candidates for standard portosystemic shunt surgery. Follow-up examination of 16 patients who underwent portosystemic shunt surgery 399 revealed no impairment of liver function or hepatic encephalopathy. Development of cholangiocarcinoma may have been a chance occurrence in an adult case not associated with Caroli disease. 400, 401 Pathological descriptions of CHF have been published by many authors. 380, 392, 402 Grossly, the liver is enlarged, has a firm to hard consistency, and shows a fine reticular pattern of fibrosis; no cysts are visible to the naked eye. Although the entire liver is usually involved, occasional lobar cases of CHF are described. 399 Microscopically, there is diffuse periportal fibrosis, the bands of fibrous tissue varying in thickness. Irregularly shaped islands of hepatic tissue, some incorporating several lobules, may be seen ( Fig. 3.27 ). When the bands of fibrous tissue are thick, hepatic venules may be encroached on and become incorporated within the fibrous tissue; thus portal hypertension in this condition may not always be presinusoidal. The fibrous bands may encircle single or groups of lobules; occasionally, a small islet of hepatic tissue becomes separated from an acinus and encircled by fibrous tissue. Numerous uniform and generally small bile ducts are scattered in the fibrous tissue ( Fig. 3.28 ). An interrupted circular arrangement of the ducts (DPM) is often recognizable (Fig. 3.29 ). The ducts are lined by cuboidal to low columnar epithelium and may contain bile or traces of mucin. They may be slightly dilated and irregular in outline. Cholestasis is not a feature of the uncomplicated case of CHF. Reduction in the number of portal vein branches is often apparent, the likely cause of the portal hypertension. There is generally minimal inflammation in CHF except in cases associated with cholangitis, when numerous neutrophils infiltrate ducts, ductules and surrounding connective tissue (Fig. 3 .30); rupture of the ducts can result in microabscess formation. Histopathologically, the latter cases may be difficult to differentiate from extrahepatic biliary obstruction with reported, 401, 428 with an incidence of 7%. 429 Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs rarely. 430 Medical treatment consists of symptomatic or prophylactic treatment of cholangitis and promotion of bile flow with ursodiol. Surgical treatment includes internal or external drainage procedures. 420 Transhepatic decompression has been advocated. 431 Segmental or lobar forms of Caroli disease can be treated by partial hepatectomy. 420, 432 Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy has been used for disintegration of intrahepatic stones. 433 Liver or combined liver and kidney transplantation has been successfully performed in patients with mono-and multilobar disease with portal hypertension, with 96 and 8 receiving liver or combined liver and kidney grafts, respectively, from 1987 to 2006 in the United States 434 ; the authors propose an algorithm for evaluation and treatment of Caroli disease.",

            "text": "Mutations mainly in two different genes, PKD1 and PKD2, can lead to ADPKD, one of the most common genetic disorders worldwide. The PKD1 gene lies on the short arm of chromosome 16 (16p 13.3), immediately adjacent to the TSC2, a gene responsible for approximately 50% of tuberous sclerosis. 355, 439 The incidence of ADPKD due to mutations in PKD1 is 1 in 1000 live births, comprising 90% of cases. The PKD1 gene encodes a protein called 'polycystin' . 440 It is present in plasma membranes of renal tubular cells, bile ductules, pancreatic ducts, 441 hepatocytes and cells of large bile ducts. In the kidney, localization at the contact points (only between neighbouring cells) indicates that its main function is cell-to-cell interaction, such that loss of function contributes to cyst formation. 442 The PKD2 gene is located on chromosome 4 (4q 21-23) and encodes a 100-kilodalton (kD) protein, polycystin 2, with sequence homology to \u03b1-subunits of voltage-activated calcium channels. 443 As mentioned earlier, localization of polycystin 1 and polycystin 2 to primary cilia in cultured renal epithelial cells 371 and demonstration that the proteins function as a ciliary flow-sensitive mechanosensors 444 implicate defects in ciliary structure and function as an important mechanism of cyst formation. 367 There is at least one unmapped focus, which accounts for 5% of the disease population. 445 Although PKD2 is clinically milder than PKD1, it does have a deleterious impact on overall life expectancy and cannot be regarded as a benign disorder. 446 The mean age to death or end-stage renal disease is 53 years in PKD1-associated disease, 69 years in PKD2-associated disease and 78 years in controls. PKD2 patients are less likely to have systemic hypertension, urinary tract infections and haematuria. 446 Cerebral aneurysms are found in 10-15% of patients with PKD1 and represent a significant risk of subarachnoidal haemorrhage causing death and disability. Familial clustering of bleeding from intracranial aneurysms is recorded. 447 In an earlier mutational analysis of 58 ADPKD families with vascular complications, 51 were PKD1 (88%) and seven PKD2 (12%). The authors found that the position of the mutation in PKD1 is predictive for development of intracranial aneurysms (59 mutations are more commonly associated with vascular disease) and is therefore of prognostic importance. 448 ADPKD is a multisystem disease with cysts and connective tissue abnormalities involving multiple organs. 449 Associated conditions include colonic diverticula (70%), cardiac valve complications (25%), ovarian cysts (40%), inguinal hernia (15%) and intracranial aneurysms (10%), suggesting a diffusely abnormal matrix. 450 Mitral valve prolapse was found in 12% of affected children. 451 ADPKD is the cause of end-stage renal disease in 8-10% of adults; the number of cysts is age related. 452 The renal disease can be present at birth, but hepatic manifestations are rare before 16 years of age. 453 The typical hepatic disorder in ADPKD is polycystic liver disease. The average age at first admission for liver-related problems was 52.8 years, with an average duration of symptoms of 3 years. 454 The symptoms included a gradually enlarging abdominal mass, upper abdominal pain or discomfort and rare episodes of severe pain with or without nausea, vomiting and occasionally fever. The most frequent physical finding is hepatomegaly, which can be massive. 455 Liver tests are often normal. Jaundice is unusual. 456, 457 Portal hypertension is rare 458 but may occur from hepatic outflow obstruction. 459, 460 There is an increased risk of gallstones in patients with hepatic cysts. 461 Rarely is treatment needed by excision 462 or a combination of excision and fenestration. 463 Additionally, it has become evident that CHF may occur with ADPKD; it becomes clinically evident in childhood or adolescence and may lead to portal hypertension. 464 Liver or combined liver and renal transplantation has been performed successfully in patients with ADPKD. 465 may appear normal (cuboidal to tall columnar), partly or completely ulcerated, or focally hyperplastic; all these changes can be found in different ducts in the same liver ( Fig. 3.33 ). Mucous glands (sometimes in abundance) may be present in the fibrotic and inflamed wall. Areas of severe epithelial dysplasia are seen rarely. 435 The lumen contains admixtures of inspissated mucin and bile, calcareous material or frank pus during bouts of acute cholangitis (Fig. 3.34 ). Caroli disease is frequently associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis (in which case it is termed Caroli syndrome), rarely with infantile polycystic disease (ARPKD) 436 and even adult polycystic disease (ADPKD). 437 According to Desmet, 347 the pathogenesis of Caroli disease seems to involve total or partial arrest of remodelling of the ductal plate of the larger intrahepatic bile ducts. In Caroli syndrome the hereditary factor causing the arrest of remodelling seems to exert its influence not only during the early period of bile duct embryogenesis, but also later on during development of the more peripheral biliary ramifications (the interlobular bile ducts).",

            "text": "One liver reported by Kwok and Lewin 455 weighed 7.7 kg. Occasionally, only one lobe, usually the left, is affected. Diffuse dilation of the intra-and extrahepatic bile ducts has been reported in some cases. 475 The cysts contain a clear, colourless or yellow fluid. Analysis of cyst fluid in one case disclosed similarities to the 'bile salt-independent' fraction of human bile, suggesting that such cysts are lined by a functioning secretory bile duct epithelium. 476 Microscopically, the cysts are lined by columnar or cuboidal epithelium, but the larger cysts have a flat epithelium (Fig. 3.36 ). Collapsed cysts resemble corpora atretica of the ovary (Fig. 3.37 ). The supporting connective tissue is scanty except in relation to von Meyenburg complexes (see Fig. 3 .36), a frequently associated lesion, where it may be dense and hyalinized. A small number of inflammatory cells, usually lymphocytes, may infiltrate the supporting stroma. Infected cysts contain pus and may rupture ( Fig. 3.38 ). Calcification of the wall of hepatic (and renal) cysts in ADPKD has been reported. 477 Von Meyenburg complexes are considered part of the spectrum of adult polycystic disease, and Melnick believed that polycystic disease of the liver develops progressively over years by gradual cystic dilation of these complexes. 478 This view is supported by a histomorphometric The incidence of liver involvement and its complications has been reviewed in a large series of 132 patients receiving and 120 patients not receiving haemodialysis. 465 Liver cysts were found by noninvasive imaging procedures in 85 of 124 patients on dialysis; gender distribution was equal. In contrast, the nondialysed population demonstrated a 75% incidence of liver cysts in females and 44% incidence in males, the peak incidence occurring 10 years earlier in females. The cysts were larger and greater in number in the nondialysed females, and there was a correlation with the number of pregnancies. Nineteen autopsies were reported in which five deaths were liver related. Risk factors for the development of hepatic cysts in ADPKD were also examined in 39 patients and 189 unaffected family members by Gabow. 466 The hepatic expression of the disease was found to be modulated by age, female gender, pregnancy and severity of the renal lesion and functional impairment. Oestrogen treatment of postmenopausal women with ADPKD is associated with selective liver enlargement and abdominal symptoms. 467 Although the leading complication in ADPKD is infection of the liver cysts, cholangiocarcinoma is the second most common complication. A study examining hepatic cyst infection suggested that the incidence increases from 1% to 3% during end-stage renal failure. 468 Enterobacteriaceae were cultured from the infected cysts in 9 of 12 patients. In the case of Ikei et al., 469 Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from the infected cysts. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan will probably make the diagnosis of cyst infections easier and more accurate. This may allow early treatment with appropriately selected antibiotics, often including a fluoroquinolone; the timely drainage of large infected cysts remains an option. 470 Hepatic cysts are rarely detected before puberty and increase with age (ultimately to 75%) in individuals over 70. 471 However, cysts have been found in early childhood and even in the first year of life. 472, 473 Before the availability of a genetic probe, the criteria for identification of this disorder in children included a positive paternal history, cysts in any portion of the renal tubule or Bowman space, macroscopic cysts in the liver and cerebral aneurysms. Molecular diagnosis is useful in individuals in whom the diagnosis of ADPKD is uncertain due to lack of family history or equivocal imaging results and in younger at-risk individuals who are being evaluated as livingrelated kidney donors. 474 Grossly, the liver in ADPKD is enlarged and diffusely cystic, the cysts varying from <1 mm to 12 cm or more in diameter ( Fig. 3 .35). substrate 80K-H gene (PRKCSH), a known gene encoding for a previously described human protein, 'noncatalytic \u03b2-subunit of glucosidase II' (GII\u03b2), have been associated with ADPKD. This protein, now renamed hepatocystin, seems to segregate in families with PCLD. 490, 491 The protein is widely distributed in tissues and predicted to be an endoplasmic reticulum luminal protein that recycles from the Golgi complex. The mutations found in PCLD are all predicted to cause premature chain termination, rendering loss-of-function changes most likely. The two-hit hypothesis for cyst formation in ADPKD appears applicable to PCLD. Glucosidase II plays a major role in regulation of proper folding and maturation of glycoproteins. Polycystin 1, polycystin 2 and fibrocystin/polyductin are all glycoproteins. Mutations could compromise the processing of the N-linked oligosaccharide chains of the newly synthesized glycoproteins. 491 Improper association and trafficking of the polycystins due to defective glycosylation by mutant GII\u03b2 may link PCLD to the ADPKD pathway. This would be consistent with the marked similarity in clinical liver disease in both conditions. 490 The second gene involved in PCLD, SEC63, encodes a protein that is part of the multicomponent translocon of the endoplasmic reticulum (Sec63p) which is required in both the post-translational and the co-translational (or signal recognition particle-dependent) targeting pathway and may explain a functional link between the two genes known to be associated with PCLD. Respective lack of expression of hepatocystin and Sep63p in PCLD cyst lining appears to correlate with mutational results. 492 Immunohistochemical analysis of cyst lining suggests that the disease involves overexpression of growth factor receptors and loss of adhesion, but proliferation or deregulated apoptosis do not seem to be implicated in PLCD. Differential findings for PRKCSH-and SEC63-PCLD suggest a divergent mechanism for cystogenesis in the two groups. 493 A recent study has identified mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) gene in patients with polycystic liver disease. 494",

            "text": "Solitary bile duct cyst is defined as a unilocular cyst lined by a single layer of columnar or low cuboidal epithelium resting on a basement membrane and a layer of fibrous tissue. The cysts occur at all ages, although the majority present in the fourth to sixth decade. They are rare in the paediatric age group; in the Boston Children's Hospital series, 31 solitary nonparasitic cysts (26 unilocular, 5 multilocular) were diagnosed in 63 years. 495 The female/male ratio is 4:1. 496 Cysts and clinicopathological study of 28 cases of ADPKD reported by Ramos et al. 479 Kida et al. 480 have suggested that cystic dilation of peribiliary glands also may lead to formation of the cysts in ADPKD. Von Meyenburg complexes are small (<0.5 cm in diameter), greyish white or green, and are usually scattered in both lobes. 481 They have an abnormal vascular pattern in angiographic studies and are occasionally associated with cavernous haemangiomas. Microscopically, the lesions are discrete, round to irregular in shape and typically periportal in location. The constituent ducts or ductules are embedded in a collagenous stroma, are round or irregular in shape and have a slightly dilated lumen ( Fig. 3 .39) (see Chapter 13) . They are lined by low columnar or cuboidal epithelium and contain pink amorphous material that may be bile stained or actual bile ( Fig. 3.40 ). Congenital hepatic fibrosis has been found in some cases. 397, 464 Cholangiocarcinomas have been reported in association with von Meyenburg complexes, 482, 483 as well as with multiple hepatic cysts considered part of the spectrum of ADPKD. 484, 485 Intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas has been reported. 486 Polycystic liver disease without kidney abnormalities Isolated polycystic liver disease (PCLD), not linked to PKD1 or PKD2, has been reported. [487] [488] [489] Germline mutations in protein kinase C In the past, the treatment of choice of solitary cysts was excision. 507 This has been supplanted by aspiration and sclerotherapy, 508, 509 however, or laparoscopic fenestration. 510, 511 Cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common autosomal recessive disorder, with an estimated incidence of approximately 1 in 2500 live births among Caucasians, has a worldwide distribution. CF was first recognized as a pancreatic disease distinct from coeliac disease in 1938. 512 Originally known as 'cystic fibrosis of the pancreas' (mucoviscidosis), the disease was soon labelled simply 'cystic fibrosis', with the recognition that not only the exocrine pancreas, but also the bronchial glands (obstructive bronchopulmonary disease), the intestinal glands (meconium ileus), the sweat glands (high sweat electrolytes) and the biliary tree (focal biliary cirrhosis) may be affected by the disease.",

            "text": "The gene was localized at chromosome 7q31.2 in 1989. 513-515 It encodes a large protein named cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), whose key role is in maintaining the fluid balance across epithelial cells. CFTR belongs to the ABC family of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent channels and transporters. It functions mainly as a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent chloride channel in the apical membrane of secretory epithelial cells of many tissues, where it promotes transmembrane efflux of chloride ions. [516] [517] [518] [519] The protein is abundantly present in the branching ducts of the pancreas, intestinal epithelium and testes, and to a lesser degree in respiratory tissue. 520 CFTR is expressed at the apical membranes of the epithelium of branching hepatic bile ducts and the gallbladder, but not on cells of the common hepatic bile duct or hepatocytes. 521, 522 The CF secretory defect results in inability to maintain the luminal hydration of ducts, leading to physicochemical abnormalities of secretions and duct obstruction. 523 More than 1000 different disease-causing mutations have been identified. They are distinguished in terms of severity on the basis of the residual activity of the codified protein. 524, 525 The most common mutation is \u0394F508, a three-base pair (bp) deletion in CFTR, resulting in loss of phenylalanine from the protein with subsequent retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. 526 Since liver disease in CF is often subclinical, its prevalence is uncertain and to some extent depends on definition, type of screening and age. As overall life expectancy has improved, liver disease has become the third most frequent cause of death in CF patients. 527, 528 The availability of new therapies targeting the function of CFTR that could prevent or reverse CF liver disease constitutes an additional rationale for identifying CF patients at risk of developing liver impairment. 529 Based on prospective studies, significant clinical liver disease is seen in 4-6% of CF patients, 530-532 but biochemical evidence of liver involvement without clinical symptoms occurs in 20-50%. 533 Autopsy series in the 1950s found an incidence of multifocal biliary fibrosis (or 'cirrhosis') of 22-25%. 534, 535 The liver disease usually becomes apparent in the first decade, with sharp decline in incidence thereafter. 530, 533 The mode of presentation of the liver disease is variable. There may be transient neonatal conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. In one series the majority of such cholestatic infants had meconium ileus, 28% had mucus plugs and 11% had focal biliary fibrosis. 536 Paucity of the intrahepatic bile ducts has been reported in one patient who presented with neonatal conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. 537 Obstruction by pancreatic fibrosis has been reported but is much more common beyond infancy. 538 Bile duct obstruction due to a rubbery concretion of abnormal bile has been reported in a few infants. 539 In late childhood, intermittent elevation of serum aminotransferases and ALP, asymptomatic hepatomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, hypersplenism or variceal haemorrhage might be the first indications of liver involvement. The unique liver lesion, termed smaller than 8-10 cm rarely cause symptoms. When present, symptoms include fullness or an upper abdominal mass, nausea and occasional vomiting. Rapid enlargement has been reported in infancy. 497 Jaundice occurs infrequently. 498 An acute abdominal crisis may result from torsion, strangulation, haemorrhage into the cyst or rupture. 499 Diagnosis is usually established by US, CT or other imaging modalities. Solitary bile duct cysts involve the right lobe twice as often as the left. Rarely, they can arise in the falciform ligament. 500 They are usually round and rarely are pedunculated; the lining is typically smooth (Fig. 3.41 ). The larger ones may contain one to several litres of fluid which is usually clear, but may be mucoid, purulent (if the cyst is infected), haemorrhagic or rarely bile stained.",

The epithelium rests on a basement membrane that in turn is supported by a layer of fibrous tissue. Adenocarcinomas may arise in the cyst. 501 Other malignancies reported to arise in solitary cysts include squamous cell carcinoma, 502 carcinosarcoma 503 and carcinoid tumour. 504 The pathogenesis of solitary bile duct cyst is unknown. A congenital origin is supported by the occurrence of the cysts in fetuses and newborns, 497 by a case presenting as a congenital diaphragmatic hernia 505 and the association of another case with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. 506 A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure is only rarely used in patients with CF liver disease because sclerotherapy or, preferably, band ligation therapy has been reasonably successful for treating bleeding esophageal varices. 574, 575 Because of rebleeds, some surgeons still advocate portosystemic shunts for patients with a good synthetic function. 575 Liver transplantation has been successful, 576,577 with long-term survival comparable with that of LT for other causes. 578 Postoperative death has resulted mainly from lung complications. A few combined liver-heart-lung, liverpancreas and liver-intestine transplants have been reported. [578] [579] [580] Pathological studies of the liver have been described in a number of reports. 512, 545, [581] [582] [583] The changes include steatosis, periportal fibrosis with ductular reaction and dilation (with or without inspissation of secretions) ( Fig. 3 .43), focal biliary fibrosis ('cirrhosis') and multinodular biliary fibrosis ('cirrhosis'). Steatosis is probably the most frequent lesion, present in 121 of 198 cases (61%) reported by Craig et al. 545 (Fig. 3 .43). The fat was located most frequently in periportal hepatocytes but was unevenly distributed throughout when severe. No positive correlations could be made between the presence of fat in the liver and the patient's general nutritional status. An incidental finding in infant livers is the deposition of haemosiderin in periportal hepatocytes. 584 This finding is presumably related to the increased iron transport from the gut in pancreatic insufficiency. 585 The characteristic, if not pathognomonic, lesion is focal biliary fibrosis, found in 22-33% of patients in three early series. 545, 581, 586 An increasing frequency with duration of survival was noted. 584 Thus it was found at postmortem examination in 10.6% of infants younger than 3 months, in 15.6% of infants from 3 to 12 months and in 26.9% of children older than 1 year.",

The ductules are generally dilated and show varying degrees of atrophy of the lining cells. The lumen contains the pathognomonic pink to light-orange, rounded masses (concretions) or amorphous material (Figs 3.44 and 3.45), first described by Farber in 1944. 587 The inspissated secretions in the cholangioles stain intensely with PAS and resist diastase digestion; they do not stain positively with mucicarmine or Alcian blue, but there may be some mucin in the interlobular bile ducts. Some greatly dilated ductules eventually rupture with extrusion of their contents and induction of an acute inflammatory response. 586 The cholangitis is thus 'chemical' 'focal biliary fibrosis' (or 'cirrhosis'), is found in over 70% of adults who die after 24 years of age. 540 A prospective study of 183 CF patients followed for a mean of 10 years revealed an incidence of liver disease of 17%. 541 Clinically relevant disease suggests an incidence of 1.4-2.7%, with a peak in adolescence. 540 Rare and unusual manifestations of liver disease in CF include common bile duct involvement proximal to the pancreas, 542 obstruction by pancreatic fibrosis and nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver in CFassociated colitis with fibrosing colonopathy. 543 At times, ERCP and liver biopsy findings may mimic those of primary sclerosing cholangitis. 544 Irrespective of relatively rare chronic progressive liver disease, steatosis (macrovesicular) is the most common pathological finding in the liver and is present in more than 50% of autopsy cases. 545 The cause of the steatosis is not entirely evident, although it has been attributed to malnutrition 546 and essential fatty acid deficiency. 547 Death from liver disease occurs in 3.4% of patients, 548 whereas lung disease accounts for 78% of CF-related deaths.",

            "text": "Factors that contribute to the variability in incidence and severity of liver disease are unknown. Some studies have found significant association with meconium ileus, 532,549 male gender, meconium ileus and severe genotype, 530 or meconium ileus and pancreatic insufficiency, 533 but such risk factors were not identified in a Swedish cohort. 531 There is no close correlation between particular CFTR mutations and liver disease. 526, 550 Kinnman et al. 522 examined the expression of CFTR and its relationship to histopathological changes in CF. They found impaired processing of \u0394F508 CFTR protein in intrahepatic biliary epithelium. However, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) expression on biliary epithelial cells and inflammatory infiltrates were rare findings, indicating that immunological mechanisms are unlikely to be involved in initiation of CF-associated liver disease. Generally, there is discordance for liver disease within sibships, 551,552 but not always. 526 These observations have intensified the search for modifier genes which may in part explain the lack of genotypic/phenotypic correlations. 553, 554 The mannose-binding lectin gene, 555 a relation with HLA-DQ6 in males, 556 and the PI*Z allele of \u03b11-antitrypsin have already been proposed as potential candidates. Among these, the PI*Z allele has been shown to increase the risk of developing severe liver disease in CF patients. 557 The development of the sweat chloride test 558 followed the observations of salt depletion through sweat during summer heat waves. 535 Values >60 mmol/L are diagnostic of CF. There are unusual CF patients with sweat chloride values between 40 and 60 mmol/L or even in the normal range. 559, 560 In such patients, abnormal bioelectric potential or immunoreactive trypsinogen screen can confirm the diagnosis. 561, 562 Extensive CFTR gene sequencing has been proposed to detect rare mutations and to establish a definite diagnosis in symptomatic patients with previously negative results. 563 An elevated serum collagen type VI has been suggested as a screening test for detection of liver disease. 564 Newborn screening using elevated serum trypsin (trypsinogen) by radioimmunoassay at 3-5 days of age or mutational analysis on Guthrie spots is followed by substantial and prolonged health gain when compared with children clinically diagnosed at a later stage. 565 Most investigations have shown improved liver enzymes, lipid profiles and vitamin A levels with ursodeoxycholic acid therapy. 547, [566] [567] [568] [569] One report documents normalization of liver function tests (LFTs) and improvement in the portal tract inflammation on pathological examination. 570 The same authors also noted improvement in ultrastructural abnormalities of bile ducts. Importantly, in CF patients, ursodeoxycholic acid is not effective for gallstone disease, 571 the incidence of which may be 12% in older patients. 572 Although the stones are often radiolucent, they contain calcium bilirubinate instead of increased cholesterol. 573 and encirclement of groups of hepatic lobules. 586 This type of lesion, referred to as 'multilobular biliary cirrhosis with concretions' or 'multilobular cirrhosis', occurs in 6% of patients older than 1 year. 582 Large irregular nodules are produced, and the deep clefts between the nodules may resemble hepar lobatum. 586 A recent study using dual-pass needle biopsy 588 emphasizes the role of liver biopsy in predicting an individual's risk of liver fibrosis or development of portal hypertension. A significant number of noncirrhotic portal hypertension in CF children is confirmed by others. 589 In addition to the presence of excessive mucus in extrahepatic bile ducts in occasional patients, there may be excessive mucus accumulation in intrahepatic bile ducts, particularly those adjacent to the porta hepatis. 582 This change occurs in 23.4% of infants under 3 months of age and in 12.5% of patients from 3 to 12 months. In two-thirds of the patients less than 3 months of age with mucus in their ducts, histological cholestasis is seen, and a history of jaundice is noted. The gallbladder in up to 30% of patients is hypoplastic and contains mucoid material and a small amount of viscid bile. Mucous cysts are seen in the wall, and stones may be present in the lumen. Liver biopsy material from 11 patients with CF was examined ultrastructurally by Arends et al. 590 A finding unique to this disease was the presence of filamentous material, with an average diameter of 15 nm, in the lumen of bile ductules and ducts. Bile granules were scattered between the filaments. A reaction product of carbohydrates was found in the filaments by histochemical techniques. It was suggested that the typical mucus deposits in bile ducts are built up from these filaments. Similar ultrastructural findings were noted by others. 5,591 Bradford et al. 591 studied the ultrastructure of liver cells in detail and described the presence of membrane-bound deposits of electron-lucent material containing electron-dense cores resembling mucus. Bile duct cells with irregular shapes protruding into the lumen and the presence of necrotic cells have been observed. 592 An increase in the number of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) around portal areas, with deposition of collagen around bile ducts and ductules, has been noted, 592, 593 and bile duct destruction, rather than cholestasis, is suggested as the inducer of collagen deposition in CF-associated fibrosis and cirrhosis. 592 A definitive role for hepatic stellate cells has been shown and TGF\u03b21, produced by bile duct epithelial cells, demonstrated as an inducer of stellate cell collagen gene expression. 594 Hereditary disorders of bile acid synthesis and bilirubin metabolism",

Total serum bile acids can also be measured by a 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase assay: these are absent or else found at very low concentrations, clearly disproportionately low to the degree of jaundice.

In both these bile acid synthetic disorders, the abnormal bile acids that are formed inhibit the canalicular ATP-dependent bile acid transporter. 601 In another consanguineous family, manifestations of 3\u03b2HSD deficiency were extremely variable: the proband died from end-stage liver disease at age 24 years, but one sister was asymptomatic at age 32 despite homozygosity for a null allele of the HSDRB7 gene encoding for 3\u03b2HSD. 602 Hepatic histopathological changes in 3\u03b2HSD deficiency depend on the age of the patient and rate of progression of the liver disease. Two of the three patients reported by Clayton et al. 597 who were biopsied at 6 weeks and 18 months of age had giant cell hepatitis and giant cell hepatitis with bridging fibrosis, respectively. Similarly, Jacquemin et al. 600 found giant cell hepatitis in young patients (4 and 6 months of age) and portal and perilobular fibrosis in older patients (36-46 months) . Three patients studied by Bove et al. 603 had portal and intralobular fibrosis with 'pseudoductular metaplasia' and cholangiolar proliferation (ductular reaction); there was no paucity of interlobular bile ducts.

Analysis can also be performed by fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) or gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). Determination of urinary cholanoids by ESI-MS/MS-MS is probably most practical, and accumulating experience argues for this investigation in any infant with neonatal hepatitis syndrome. 596 Most of the entities in this rapidly developing sector of genetic liver disease are rare, having been identified in only a few patients, but they may be more common than this. Affected enzymes may be microsomal, cytoplasmic or peroxisomal. Importantly, infants with severe liver disease may acquire defects in bile acid synthesis, usually \u0394 4 -3-oxosteroid-5\u03b2-reductase, and they must be distinguished from those with an inherited disorder of bile acid synthesis, since treatment may be different. Gene sequencing may be required to confirm or disconfirm the diagnosis in some cases. Clinical experience shows that patients with genetic disorders of bile acid synthesis often respond well to oral bile acid supplementation. Table 3 .3 shows currently identified primary disorders of bile acid synthesis. The discussion here focuses on defects in (1) 3\u03b2-hydroxy-\u0394 5 -C 27 -steroid dehydrogenase/isomerase (3\u03b2HSD), (2) \u0394 4 -3-oxosteroid-5\u03b2-reductase, (3) oxysterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase and (4) sterol 27-hydroxylase (CTX). Some rare defects causing infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia are also discussed, as well as amidation disorders that may present with transient, apparently idiopathic, neonatal hepatitis syndrome or later in childhood with growth failure and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency.

Some patients with defective amidation present in early infancy with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, occasionally severe enough to resemble biliary atresia. Liver biopsies in those patients showed lobular cholestasis, giant cell transformation of hepatocytes and mild to severe ductular reaction with bridging fibrosis but no ductular bile plugs. 620 Other patients are never noted to be jaundiced but have growth retardation and severe deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins resulting in rickets or coagulation abnormalities. 620 Infants who do manifest jaundice also have prominent clinical features of fat-soluble vitamin deficiency. Based on limited observations, this seems to be a low-GGT disorder. Detailed analysis of serum bile acids shows striking lack of conjugated bile acids, but total bile acid concentrations may be elevated. Histological analysis may show a giant cell hepatitis or ductopenia. Immunostaining for BAAT is depleted or absent. Similar clinical disease appears to occur with BACL mutations. In one reported case where the amidation defect was associated with BACL deficiency, 621 the infant was homozygous for a missense mutation in ABCB11 (thus compromising BSEP); however, other cases exclusively with BACL defects have been identified.

Elevation of primary bile acids should raise doubts concerning a diagnosis of a bile acid synthetic defect, and other aetiologies should be sought. Why these patients might respond to ursodeoxycholic acid is unclear other than by a decrease in the levels of the offending bile acids. If clinical response is insufficient, improvement subsequently can be observed with chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid therapy. 611 More recent experience indicates that response to supplementation with chenodeoxycholic plus cholic acid is better in patients whose disease is not advanced. 612 Light microscopic and ultrastructural findings in 5\u03b2-reductase deficiency (and other bile acid synthetic defects) are discussed in detail by Bove et al. 603 Light microscopic changes in most reported cases resemble nonspecific neonatal hepatitis, with prominent cholestasis, giant cell transformation and erythropoiesis. Interlobular bile ducts are consistently normal. Ultrastructurally, injury patterns common to other forms of cholestasis are seen, as well as features that may be specific for the defect. Thus there is a nonuniform mosaic of normal and abnormal canaliculi, often in adjacent clusters of hepatocytes, but there is no canalicular dilation. However, some canaliculi show diverticula, and junctional complexes are extraordinarily convoluted, often enclosing pockets of dense granular material presumed to be bile residue.",

One infant has been described who presented with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and low GGT and whose liver disease had already advanced to cirrhosis. 613 Serum levels of 27-hydroxy cholesterol were greater than 4500 times normal. Histopathologically, the liver showed giant cell transformation, ductular reaction, and canalicular and bile duct plugging; no specific ultrastructural changes were noted. 613 Both parents had an exon 5 premature terminated codon (R388X) as a heterozygous defect. There was no response to either ursodeoxycholic acid or cholic acid, either by clinical indicators or alterations in the measured bile acids. This patient underwent a liver transplant but died of complications relating to disseminated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. A second patient also succumbed to severe cholestatic liver disease in the first year of life. Two patients have been reported subsequently: one died at age 11 months before LT, 614 and the other had successful living-related donor transplant from an obligate heterozygote. 615 Both patents had cirrhosis with multinucleated giant cells on liver biopsy. A single case of successful treatment with chenodeoxycholic acids has been reported. 616 Patients with oxysterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase have normal serum GGT and, in general, rapidly progressive liver disease.

In 1972, Linarelli et al. 650 suggested that the ultrastructure of canalicular bile was coarsely granular in PFIC and called it 'Byler's bile' (Fig. 3.47 ). Subsequently, this type of bile was found to be characteristic of FIC1 deficiency, from which members of the Amish Byler family suffer. 644, 649 The function of the FIC1 protein, a P-type ATPase, has been unclear. 651, 652 Groen et al. 653 have proposed a model by which the concerted action of FIC1 and MDR3, encoded by ABCB4, is critical in maintaining the asymmetrical lipid composition of the hepatocyte plasma membrane outer leaflet (facing the canalicular lumen) and the inner leaflet (facing the cytoplasm). FIC1 is a flippase, and MDR3 is a floppase. FIC1, along with an accessory protein CDC50A, flips phosphatidylserine from the outer to inner leaflet to complement the action of MDR3, which 'flops' phosphatidylcholine from the inner to the outer leaflet so that it can be associated manifestations vary from mental retardation developing during adolescence to normal intelligence throughout adult life. 631, 632 Spasticity and ataxia are usually detected in the second and third decades. Progression results in dementia, spinal cord paresis and peripheral neuropathy. Less frequent findings include seizures, gallstones and osteoporosis. Death in the fourth to sixth decade is usually related to neurological deterioration; however, some patients develop early heart disease and/or atheroma. 633 The 5\u03b1-dihydro derivative of cholesterol, cholestanol (but not cholesterol), is elevated in serum. There is excessive deposit of cholestanol and cholesterol in tissues. Bile acid concentrations are low in bile, with high bile alcohol levels in bile and urine. 634 Heterozygotes can be detected by measurement of urinary bile alcohol levels after administration of a bile salt-binding agent, cholestyramine. 635 Liver specimens from two patients revealed intracellular inclusions that appeared either as amorphous pigment or in crystalloid form. 636 The pigment is usually found in association with the smooth endoplasmic reticulum but occasionally lies free in the cytosol. An ultrastructural study of four cases revealed perisinusoidal fibrosis, bile canalicular changes (dilation, distortion and loss of microvilli, increase in microfilaments), fatty change, proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, accumulation of lipofuscin, focal cytoplasmic degeneration, proliferation of microbodies and prominent mitochondrial changes. 637 One patient had crystalloid cores in microbodies that disappeared after therapy. 637 The accumulated material may indicate the presence of unmetabolizable bile alcohols resulting from a defect of bile acid synthesis. 636 ",

            "text": "Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) was originally described in 1965 in a Pennsylvanian Amish kindred named Byler, thus called Byler disease/syndrome. Now PFIC is recognized as occurring worldwide. [641] [642] [643] Although widely referred to as PFIC types 1, 2 and 3, these terms are confusing and should be avoided. The disorders have been reclassified according to the molecular basis, with designation based on the protein that is deficient. Since genetic testing is not always immediately available, a clinical subdivision is 662 and eventually cirrhosis. There is usually marked intracellular retention of biliary pigment and considerable hepatocyte disarray. Byler bile is not seen; instead the bile is amorphous or finely filamentous, and microvilli are lost. 662 Mallory-Denk bodies may be present. 649, 663, 664 Individual mutations do not correlate with specific histological patterns. 662 Milder forms of BSEP deficiency do not seem to constitute as large a proportion of later-onset disease as seen with FIC1 deficiency; however, there is also clearly a spectrum of disease, 665 which may be considerably underestimated due to difficulties in clinical diagnosis. A missense mutation in a sibling pair manifested in childhood with a BRIC phenotype but later progressed to advanced fibrosis. BSEP function was impaired, although its canalicular with bile salts to form micelles. This asymmetry would make the membrane outer leaflet resistant to the detergent effect of bile salts, which are at high concentration in the bile duct lumen. The precise mechanism by which a defect in this flippase function leads to cholestasis and extrahepatic manifestations is still not clear. 651, 652 The reduction in ectoenzymes seen in the canalicular membrane of patients probably reflects the bile acid-dependent extraction seen in mice. 651 This finding has been proposed as an indirect feature of PFIC1, although in the absence thus far of a specific antibody available for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. In PFIC1 patients, expression of GGT and neutral endopeptidase (CD10) is lost on the canalicular membrane but not on the cholangiocyte apical surface. In contrast, canalicular expression of integral membrane proteins encoded by ABCB11 and ABCB4 (BSEP and MDR3, respectively) is preserved. 651 Other rare cholestatic disorders have been identified as FIC1 deficiency. A form of cholestatic syndrome was reported as being specific to the inhabitants of Greenland. 654 Jaundice, bleeding, pruritus, malnutrition, steatorrhoea, osteodystrophy and dwarfism were typical clinical features. Eight of the children died between ages 6 weeks and 3 years from bleeding or infections. Hyperbilirubinaemia, profound hypoprothrombinaemia, thrombocytosis and elevated ALP values were evident. 'Greenland familial cholestasis' has now been shown to be FIC1 deficiency, with all affected individuals carrying two copies of the same missense mutation. 655 Ornvold et al. 656 studied the liver biopsies from the 16 children and characterized the changes as early, intermediate and late. Early changes (up to 5 months of age) were restricted to the perivenular zone and consisted of cholestasis with rosette formation. Intermediate-stage changes (5-14 months) included perivenular and then periportal fibrosis in addition to persistent cholestasis. Changes in the late stage (17-60 months) included progressive cholestasis and portoportal and portocentral fibrosis in seven patients, and cirrhosis in two of the patients. Inflammation and paucity of bile ducts were not seen. Although poorly documented and now largely disappeared, it is likely that the 'Welsh cholestasis' was also a form of FIC1 deficiency. 657 Bile salt export pump deficiency Also known as 'progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2' (PFIC2), 658 BSEP deficiency is caused by mutations in ABCB11, which by this toxic bile, in particular the damage it causes to the biliary epithelium resulting in a cholangiopathy. In severe cases the features seen include portal inflammation, bile ductular reaction and subsequent fibrosis 646 (Fig. 3.51 A) . In the neonatal setting, conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in the presence of elevated serum GGT values differs dramatically from the normal GGT levels usually observed in patients with FIC1 and BSEP disease. The histological differential diagnosis on liver biopsy specimens is with biliary atresia or other disorders manifesting in a biliary pattern. Copper and copper-binding protein accumulate considerably, and in excess of the levels usually observed with other cholangiopathies, potentially simulating Wilson disease. 679 In the somewhat older child, the cardinal diagnostic finding is that cholangiography discloses normal biliary architecture despite the appearance of bile duct obstruction.",

IHC may reveal no canalicular expression or focal, patchy and faint canalicular staining. 661 Redistribution of BSEP expression from cytoplasmic to canalicular (retargeting) or de novo expression has been described in children treated with ursodeoxycholic acid and biliary diversion. 672 Genetic liver diseases in which the gene is only expressed in the liver have generally been thought to be ideal candidates for liver transplantation. BSEP deficiency has recently highlighted a problem, which may have wider significance. Patients have been noted to occasionally have 'recurrent disease' . [673] [674] [675] [676] It is only recently that the mechanism has been determined to be caused by the presence of antibodies against the BSEP protein of the liver graft. 674 It appears that the antibodies are capable of inhibiting the function of the protein. Various strategies have been employed to overcome the problem, but several patients have been retransplanted before the mechanism of apparently recurrent disease was understood.",

In the absence of phospholipids, bile acids cannot form mixed micelles, and the bile is extremely hydrophobic. 678 Much or all of the phenotype is probably induced inflammation, resembling the changes in the mouse model. One diagnostic test is the detection of low bile phospholipid levels. When compared to the control bile samples of cholestatic children with sclerosing cholangitis (mean phospholipid, bile acid and cholesterol concentration of 29.1 mmol/L, 116.5 mmol/L and 3.4 mmol/L, respectively), the bile of patients with a PFIC3 phenotype had much lower phospholipid concentration (mean phospholipid, bile acid and cholesterol concentration of 1.4 mmol/L, 25.7 mmol/L and 0.74 mmol/L, respectively). 684 In patients with MDR3 deficiency, the biliary bile salt/phospholipid and cholesterol/phospholipid ratios are approximately five times higher than control bile. Biliary phospholipids in MDR3 deficiency patients are 1-15% of total biliary lipids (normal range, 19-24%). The residual percentage relates to the severity of the mutation (<2% associated with nonsense frameshift mutations). 689 Mutations in ABCB4 may also manifest as lowphospholipid-associated cholelithiasis syndrome, characterized by biliary symptoms before 40 years of age, intrahepatic microlithiasis and recurrence of biliary symptoms after cholecystectomy. 690",

            "text": "As with PFIC, benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) was also described in 1965. 691 Although the name and the original description suggest a distinct condition, it is now understood that BRIC is really a form of PFIC. When associated with ATP8B1 mutations, it is called BRIC1, and when associated with ABCB11 mutations, BRIC2; its association with as yet undetermined transporter defects is still possible. The clinical definition of BRIC involves specific criteria: at least two episodes of jaundice separated by a symptom-free interval lasting several months to years; laboratory values consistent with intrahepatic cholestasis, notably elevated serum GGT and total serum bile acids; severe pruritus and normal intra-and extrahepatic bile ducts confirmed by cholangiography. 692 The clinical presentation is usually jaundice with pruritus, but there is much interindividual variation in terms of severity, frequency and duration of episodes. Symptoms can be triggered by factors such as pregnancy, oral contraceptives, drugs or infection. There is an association with gallstones. Severe cholestasis in a young adult with polymorphism in ABCB11 and ATP8B1 preceded the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma with cholestasis liver disease including primary sclerosing cholangitis have ABCB4 mutations. Progressive cholestatic liver failure in the adult members of a Transylvanian family was characterized histologically by a small duct cholangiopathy with ductopenia and associated with ABCB4 mutation. 682 Heterozygosity for ABCB4 mutations have been observed in children with cholestatic liver disease. 683 Furthermore, a reduction in biliary phospholipid not only results in parenchymal damage but also reduces the amount of cholesterol that may be maintained in solution. [684] [685] [686] As with BSEP, anti-MDR3 antibodies have been raised. Although this may be a useful method of establishing a complete loss of protein (Fig. 3.51 B) , it is less clear-cut in milder cases, as also evident in cell lines. 677 Partial loss of MDR3 function may lead to a more slowly progressive disease (Figs 3.52-3.54), but may still require liver transplantation. Lipid clefts may be identified in the lumen of bile ducts. 687 Cholestasis during pregnancy has also been reported in individuals heterozygous for mutations in ABCB4 (MDR3 deficiency). 646, 688 Histopathological findings include bile ductular reaction with model of microfilament dysfunction-induced cholestasis. The disease locus was mapped to chromosome 16q22. 712 A single mutation was identified in all affected individuals in a gene labelled CIRH1A. 713 The encoded protein (cirhin) has proved to be a nucleolar protein. 714 It remains controversial. 715, 716 A zebrafish model suggests a role in biliary development. 717 Cirhin also interacts with the nucleolar protein NOL11, which has a role in production of ribosomes. 718 The common mutation found in patients with North American Indian childhood cirrhosis (NAIC) disrupts that interaction.",

This name is misleading, however, in that the degree of hepatic inflammation can be very severe. Moreover, the infant can have various metabolic defects affecting glucose metabolism (resulting in hypoglycaemia), urea synthesis and fatty acid synthesis. The infant may appear to have galactosaemia due to decreased UDP-galactose epimerase activity, but in citrullinaemia type II, measurement of serum amino acids shows elevated plasma levels of citrulline and methionine. 36, 720 Liver biopsy may display steatosis in addition to inflammatory changes. by 7 months. 693 In one series, early onset of the first attack was associated with a more severe course, in terms of frequency and duration of attacks; some patients developed kidney stones, pancreatitis and diabetes. 694 The authors proposed dropping the adjective 'benign' because of the profoundly detrimental effect that the disease has on the long-term quality of life of affected patients. The suggestion that BRIC is in fact not benign is supported by the finding that some cases do progress, if slowly. 695, 696 There is a spectrum of severity, with some degree of genotype to phenotype correlation. 647 Histopathological observations of biopsy specimens from 22 patients at the milder end of the BRIC spectrum were detailed by Brenard et al. 697 During attacks of jaundice, cholestasis (hepatocellular and canalicular) occurred in all patients, and infiltration of portal areas with mononuclear cells in seven patients. Other findings included focal mononuclear cell infiltration with or without focal necrosis, infiltration of portal areas with many eosinophils, ductular reaction (one patient) and periportal fibrosis (one patient).",

Some investigators have found ursodeoxycholic acid to be more beneficial in PFIC. 698, 699 Some patients with FIC1 deficiency respond poorly to ursodeoxycholic acid treatment. It may be of particular benefit in MDR3 deficiency, where bile salt hydrophobicity is thought to be particularly important in the disease pathogenesis; certainly, findings in the mouse model for MDR3 deficiency support this concept. 700 Partial bile diversion by a cholecystojejunal cutaneous conduit and/or ileal diversion produces complete resolution of the liver disease, but the results are variable from one institution to another. The surgery must be performed before significant fibrosis has developed. [701] [702] [703] [704] [705] [706] New treatment modalities are in development. The possibility of chemical chaperones for certain mutations is being explored. Specifically, 4-phenylbutyrate has been proposed as treatment for BSEP deficiency. 658 A wealth of data, mainly unpublished, regarding liver transplantation in PFIC exists. It appears to show generally good results in both BSEP deficiency and MDR3 deficiency. The results in FIC1 deficiency are less clear, in keeping with the widespread expression of the gene. In one series, hepatic transplantation was performed in 14 children with 'Byler's disease' . 707 One patient died postoperatively from arterial thrombosis. In the remaining 13 patients, graft function, growth and quality of life were good after an average follow-up of 17 months, without evidence of disease recurrence.

Jaundice occurred neonatally in nine children but disappeared before the end of the first year. Subsequent reports clarified that this was a high-GGT cholestatic disorder. 711 On light microscopy, there was giant cell transformation and bilirubinostasis. Progressive liver damage was documented by persistently high levels of ALP, moderate elevation of aminotransferases severe pruritus and morphologically by fibrosis and cirrhosis. Early portal hypertension and variceal bleeding necessitated portosystemic shunts in seven children. Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical studies suggested that this group of children might represent a human \u03b1-lipoprotein level was found in affected individuals.

By contrast, some infants with neonatal conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia clear the jaundice and experience a period of apparent recovery. Later, cholestasis recurs, and imaging of the biliary tree reveals an appearance similar to that of primary sclerosing cholangitis. These infants are said to have 'neonatal sclerosing cholangitis' (NSC). It was first described in 1987, with subsequent reports. 721, 722 Serum GGT is elevated. The disease mechanism is likely multiple, and it has not been determined for every case. Affected infants should not undergo a Kasai portoenterostomy; medical management is that of childhood chronic cholestatic liver disease; with the development of end-stage biliary cirrhosis, liver transplantation is the required intervention.",

Patients lack the enzyme uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase completely and consequently are unable to conjugate bilirubin. 746 Mutations in exons 2-5 of the UGT1A gene affect all isoforms influencing glucuronidation of bilirubin and other substrates (type Ia). Mutations of exon 1 affect bilirubin glucuronidation only (type Ib). 744 Therapy is difficult and limited. Patients do not respond to phenobarbital. Phototherapy has been used long-term with plasmapheresis for acute bilirubin elevations and, if initiated promptly, such therapy can reverse early bilirubin encephalopathy. 747, 748 Therapeutic effectiveness decreases during adolescence. 749, 750 Currently, light-generating blankets or mattresses have proved effective. 751 Liver transplantation results in a cure. 749, 750, 752 This can also be achieved by an orthotopic auxiliary transplant. Experimental hepatocyte transplantation has decreased the hours needed for phototherapy. 753 Gene therapy is under investigation. The Gunn rat has been a valuable animal model. 754 The histopathology of the liver in Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I is characterized by intrahepatic cholestasis (Fig. 3.55) , 5,755-757 but the liver may be normal. 5 Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II appears to be a milder variant of type I. It is also characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. The deficiency of bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase is less severe, but the mechanism of this difference is not entirely clear. 744 Arias et al. 758 described Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II in 1969. Patients present with neonatal jaundice, but the jaundice is less severe than in patients with type I. Bilirubin levels fluctuate between 7 and 20 mg/dL. These patients generally do not develop the severe intellectual compromise of type I patients, although during an Figure 3 . 55 Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I.

Caused by a defect underlying defect is complete absence of the canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT). The ABCC2 gene is localized to chromosome 10q24. 782 It was cloned in humans in 1996. 783 Human multidrug-resistance protein 2 (MDR2) is the same gene with 32 exons. 784 Multiple gene mutations have been documented and can be detected in fibroblasts. 785 The most common mutation is R1066X, which leads to a premature termination of cMOAT. 786 On liver biopsy, IHC for cMOAT (MDR2) reveals a complete absence of staining (Fig. 3.56 C) . Animal models include the Corriedale sheep 787 and the transport-deficient (TR) rat. 788 Pigment accumulation resembling that of the Dubin-Johnson syndrome has been described in the howler monkey. 789 Accumulation of a coarsely granular brown pigment, called lipomelanin, in liver cells is characteristic of the Dubin-Johnson syndrome 775, 777 (Fig. 3.56 A) . Lobular distribution is diffuse, although more heavily concentrated in the perivenular zone. The accumulation of the pigment in hepatocytes gives the liver a grey to black colour grossly, although this feature may be less prominent in younger patients. Thus the gross (black) colour of the liver biopsy core may be diagnostic. The pigment shares some of its physicochemical properties with lipofuscin and melanin in that it is Oil Red O-positive (in frozen sections), stains black with the Fontana stain ( Fig. 3.56 B) , is variably PAS positive and is autofluorescent when examined by ultraviolet microscopy. 790 Ultrastructurally, the Dubin-Johnson pigment is lysosomal and thought to differ from lipofuscin C B A Histopathological findings in the liver in PCT include the accumulation of uroporphyrin in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. Needleshaped cytoplasmic inclusions have been identified in hepatocytes by light, fluorescent and electron microscopy in biopsy specimens; the crystals are also birefringent under polarizing light. 825, 826 According to Cortes et al., 825 the inclusions are best seen by light microscopy in unstained paraffin sections. The crystals can be specifically stained in paraffin sections by the ferric ferricyanide reduction test ( Fig. 3 .57). 827 They are often found close to ferritin-like deposits. 826 Morphometric studies have shown significantly greater amounts of uroporphyrin crystals in familial than sporadic PCT. 826 The crystals have been induced experimentally in mice by iron overload. 828 Ultrastructurally, they reveal alternating areas of differing electron density. The crystals appear to be a mixture of porphyrinogens and porphyrins surrounding uroporphyrin crystals. 828 Other changes in liver biopsy specimens from patients with PCT have been described in several series. 825, 829, 830 They include steatosis, variable haemosiderosis in periportal hepatocytes and fibrosis. Cortes et al. 825 found periductal lymphoid aggregates in 43% of their cases. The incidence of cirrhosis in two series was 33% and 34%. 825, 830 It should be emphasized that tests for chronic viral hepatitis, particularly chronic HCV infection, were not performed in these series.",

[834] [835] [836] [837] [838] [839] [840] The risk in patients with acute hepatic porphyria is high particularly after 50 years of age. 798 Factors related to an increased risk of HCC in PCT are a long symptomatic period before start of therapy, chronic hepatitis (particularly HCV), iron overload and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. In one series, there was a direct relationship between increasing age and extent of liver damage, with fibrosis present at a mean of 48 years, cirrhosis at 57 years and HCC at 66 years. 825 A somatic second-hit mutation has been proposed as the critical mechanism for the development of HCC in acute porphyrias. 841 in one of the eight enzymes involved in haem synthesis, porphyrias are classified into hepatic or erythropoietic depending on where overproduction of the haem precursors takes place. Porphyrias manifest with cutaneous sensitivity, acute neurovisceral symptoms or both. 797 Acute hepatic porphyrias are associated with primary liver cancer and in particular hepatocellular carcinoma. 798 Only two of the porphyrias importantly affect the liver: porphyria cutanea tarda and the erythrocytic protoporphyrias. Severe liver injury is increasingly recognized in association with X-linked protoporphyria, 799 the variability of its manifestations probably depending on random X chromosome inactivation. 800 Liver transplantation is used to treat the liver disease complicating porphyria or to correct the genetic defect causing intractable neurovisceral involvement.",

Most patients with PCT have the sporadic form (type I). Decreased activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase is restricted to the liver, and the family history is negative. Familial (type II) PCT, accounting for approximately 20% of cases of PCT, is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The gene (UROD, encoding enzyme hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase) is located on chromosome 1p34. 806 The enzyme defect (50% reduction of activity) is present in all tissues. Clinical penetrance is low, with less than 10% of affected persons developing symptoms. Of note, some familial PCT occurs with mutations in gene(s) other than UROD; this is classified as PCT type III. Familial (type II) PCT has an earlier onset than sporadic (type I) PCT, with some cases presenting in childhood.",

[810] [811] [812] [813] Mild to moderate iron overload is found in 60-70% of patients with PCT; 10% have increases in the range of hereditary haemochromatosis. 814 In almost all studies, a high prevalence of HFE gene mutations has been detected, with differences between patients of northern European ancestry and those of Mediterranean origin. 815 In a U.S. study, 19% of the PCT patients tested were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, and 7% were compound heterozygous (0.5% and 1.0%, respectively, in the general population). 810 Viral infections may trigger PCT. Initial reports documented a high incidence (40%, 57% and 70.7% in three series) of hepatitis B serological markers in PCT [816] [817] [818] and anecdotal cases of HIV infection. 819 The strong association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) and PCT is most important. 816, [820] [821] [822] In the series reviewed by Elder, 803 the prevalence of antibodies to HCV in PCT has ranged from 9% to 79%. This is broadly related to the level of endemicity of HCV infection in the general population in various countries. A subsequent meta-analysis allowed Gisbert et al. 821 to conclude that the mean prevalence of HCV infection, detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in PCT patients, is approximately 50%, much higher than that reported in the general population. Prevalence similarly varied depending on the country and the type of PCT (57% in sporadic, 25% in familial). It must be noted that HCV infection in itself is unlikely to derange the haem synthesis pathway; only a small proportion of HCV patients show an increase in urinary porphyrins, and prevalence of PCT among HCV patients is 1-5%. 820, 823 Treating PCT patients with chloroquine apparently does not affect the course of the underlying liver disease. 824 by mononuclear cells. Cholelithiasis occurs in some patients with EPP, and the calculi contain protoporphyrin. 870 Crystals isolated from the liver in one EPP patient had the same fluorescence spectrum as protoporphyrin. 870 The deposits in canaliculi, bile ducts and Kupffer cells display bright-red birefringence with a centrally located, dark Maltese cross ( Fig. 3.59 ). 871 Some of the larger deposits and most of the smaller ones in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and Kupffer cells appear as clusters of brilliantly illuminated granules on polarizing microscopy.",

            "text": "Approximately 90 different mutations have been identified in the ferrochelatase gene, localized on chromosome 18, including point mutations, nucleotide deletions and a partial chromosome deletion. 805, [853] [854] [855] [856] The ferrochelatase gene is composed of 11 exons and 10 introns with a size of approximately 4.5 kilobases (kb), and the enzyme is localized to the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Patients with EPP who develop liver disease usually have a mutation in one ferrochelatase allele that alters enzyme function, together with a polymorphism in the nonmutant allele that causes low gene expression. This results in significant increase in the hepatobiliary excretion of protoporphyrin, which can damage the liver through both cholestatic injury and oxidative stress. 857 Haematin has been the most successful medical therapy. 858,859 Liver transplantation is appropriate for patients with liver failure or end-stage cirrhosis. 860, 861 However, recurrence of protoporphyric liver disease has been reported. [861] [862] [863] Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is needed after LT to prevent disease recurrence in younger patients. 864 A mouse model is available for future evaluation of therapy. [865] [866] [867] The hepatobiliary alterations in this murine model have been reversed by BMT. 868 It has thus been suggested that BMT may be an option for EPP patients at risk of developing hepatic complications. 868 A recent study has confirmed that bone marrow-derived cells play a significant role in restoring and regenerating hepatic tissue in this mouse model. 869 Macroscopically, the liver affected by EPP is generally black. The first description of the characteristic, if not pathognomonic, changes was published by Cripps and Scheuer. 844 Sections from percutaneous hepatic biopsy specimens from five patients showed focal accumulations of a dense, dark-brown pigment in canaliculi, interlobular bile ducts, connective tissue and Kupffer cells (Fig. 3.58) . The pigment had an intense red autofluorescence in frozen sections examined by fluorescence microscopy with an iodinetungsten-quartz light source. Two of the patients had portal and periportal fibrosis, and in one case, the portal areas were infiltrated ",

Von Gierke 889 described type Ia GSD in 1929. The incidence of the disease is 1 in 100,000. Inheritance is autosomal recessive. The G6PC gene is mutated in type Ia GSD and is located on chromosome 17q21, 890 while the SLC37A4 gene is mutated in type Ib and is located on chromosome 11q23. 891 At least 84 mutations have been reported in type Ia and 80 mutations in type Ib GSD. 892, 893 Overall, type Ia is more common, accounting for approximately 80% of GSD type I cases. 894 Of note, previous classification of 'types Ic and Id' GSD was based on the belief that additional genes were involved, but subsequent studies have shown that these cases have type Ib SLC37A4 mutations. 895 In 1952, Cori and Cori 896 reported that G6P activity was virtually absent in the livers of individuals with type I GSD. This enzyme is necessary for gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, providing 80% of the normal hepatic glucose production. In addition to the liver, glucose-6-phosphatase also is present in the kidney, pancreas and intestinal epithelium, but not in white blood cells (WBCs). 897 In type Ia GSD, glucose-6-phosphatase protein expression is absent generates high levels of protoporphyrin in erythrocytes, found either as free protoporphyrin or as zinc chelated. These patients may be at higher risk for hepatic complications. Phenotypic variation is considerable. Prevalence in a North American series was greater than that in European series, accounting for 10% of patients with a disorder appearing to be EPP. 888 due to G6PC gene mutations, while in type Ib GSD, a transmembrane transport protein is defective (glucose-6-phosphatase translocase, encoded by SLC37A4). 898 This transporter is present in many organs, as well as being active in neutrophils and monocytes. In fact, the loss of glucose-6-phosphatase translocase activity in WBCs leads to neutrophil dysfunction through enhanced endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress and apoptosis, all leading to neutropenia. 893 In the first year of life, type I GSD usually presents with hypoglycaemia in the presence of a greatly enlarged liver. Additional features associated with type Ib GSD include neutropenia, recurrent infections and inflammatory bowel disease, which may resemble Crohn's disease. Affected individuals also can have oral, perioral and perianal ulcers, infections, abscesses and fistulas. [899] [900] [901] [902] Effective medical management permits survival into adulthood, if death does not occur in the first year of life. However, in adulthood, type I GSD is a multisystemic disorder. All adults with GSD type Ia have hepatomegaly. 903 Other common findings include short stature in 90%; hepatocellular adenomas in 75%, usually multiple; iron deficiency in 81%; proteinuria from focal glomerulosclerosis in 67%; renal calcification in 65%; and osteopenia and fractures in 27% of patients. Hypertriglyceridaemia occurs in all patients, hypercholesterolaemia in 76%, and hyperuricaemia in 89%. Less common complications include pancreatitis (thought to be secondary to high lipid levels) and myocardial infarction (from coronary artery disease). Pericardial effusion with valvular disease has been reported. 903 In children, epistaxis and bleeding during invasive procedures is associated with long bleeding times. Studies indicate a decrease in platelet adhesion, aggregation and ATP release associated with hypoglycaemia, which can improve after normalization of blood glucose levels. 904, 905 Von Willebrand factor may be deficient. Correction has been documented with intravenous 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP). 906 Two serious complications of this GSD type I may develop by adulthood. Chronic renal disease is caused by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis without immune deposits and uric acid nephropathy. 907 Hyperfiltration occurs throughout childhood. 908 The second major complication is the hepatocellular adenomas. [909] [910] [911] The male/female ratio is at least 2:1 for individuals who develop adenomas. Adenomas are seen as early as 3 years of age and as late as 40 years, the vast majority developing in the second decade. The development of adenomas appears to be independent of dietetic treatment, compliance to treatment or biochemical parameters related to metabolic balance. 912 On IHC subclassification, most of the hepatic adenomas are inflammatory adenomas or unclassified adenomas. For example, one large study found 26 of 33 hepatic adenomas were inflammatory adenomas, while the remaining five were unclassified. 913 There is a well-documented risk of malignant transformation in the hepatic adenomas, although it is not clear if the risk is the same for inflammatory adenomas versus unclassified adenomas. In one study, mean patient age was 23 years, and adenomas were followed between 2 and 7 years before malignant transformation. 909 Of note, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels are often not elevated; thus the diagnosis of malignant transformation of a hepatic adenoma depends on the presence of careful liver imaging and/or liver biopsy. HCCs can develop even if successful dietary management leads to adenoma regression. 914, 915 The goal of therapy for GSD type I in infancy and childhood is to keep the glucose level at 70 mg/dL. This can be achieved by nocturnal gastric infusions of glucose-containing solutions, or by the administration of uncooked cornstarch around the clock, or by a combination of both. 916, 917 Infections and inflammatory bowel disease in type GSD type Ib can be improved by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), 918 which seems to ameliorate neutrophil membrane function, 919 but does not reduce the number of apoptotic neutrophils in the circulation. 920 In one study of 17 patients with long-term follow-up, near-normal growth was achieved; however, puberty was delayed in five patients. Five patients also received allopurinol for hyperuricaemia, while two were treated for hypertriglyceridaemia. Some 35% of the patients were anaemic. Hepatocellular adenomas developed in 29%.",

The deficient enzyme can be measured in the liver, WBCs or cultured fibroblasts, and prenatal diagnosis is available. The GBE1 gene is located on chromosome 3p12; multiple defects have been described, 960, 961 which may correlate with clinical heterogeneity. 962 The prenatal course may be complicated by polyhydramnios, decreased fetal movement and dilated cardiomyopathy. 963 A rare infantile variant exists with early perinatal death. [964] [965] [966] Infantile presentation includes hepatosplenomegaly and failure to thrive. Some patients may have arthrogryposis of the lower limbs. 961 Hypoglycaemia is rare except as a feature of liver failure. Occasionally, patients may not have progression of the liver disease. 967 Later presentation includes congestive cardiac failure, skeletal muscle weakness and nerve involvement. 968, 969 In adults, progressive involvement of the upper and lower motor neurons, sensory loss, early neurogenic bladder and, in some patients, late dementia may be presenting features. 962 Adult cases are sometimes referred to as 'adult polyglucosan body disease' . 970, 971 Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for patients who develop liver failure.

Vacuolated cells are particularly prominent in autopsy material as a result of the disappearance of extralysosomal glycogen. In the kidneys, glycogen accumulation is primarily in the loops of Henle and collecting tubules, a location that distinguishes this variety from GSD type I. 945, 946 Type III glycogen storage diseases (Forbes disease, limit dextrinosis)",

GSD type XI results from defective function of GLUT2, 985 which is the most important glucose transporter in hepatocytes, pancreatic \u03b2-cells, enterocytes and renal tubular cells. 986 The SLC2A2 gene encoding GLUT2 is on chromosome 3q26.1-q26.3, and 34 different mutations have been reported. 987 Deficiency results in impaired import and export of glucose and galactose in affected tissues. Renal glycogen accumulation leads to impaired tubular function, Fanconi nephropathy and rickets. Patients may be picked up by the galactosaemia screen test because galactose, as well as glucose, is transported by GLUT2. 987 Untreated, the disease can be compatible with survival into adulthood, but patients continue to be symptomatic even after hepatomegaly recedes. 985 Glycogen synthase deficiency (glycogen storage disease type 0) Glycogen synthase deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism leading to fasting hypoglycaemia in infancy or early childhood that is accompanied by high blood ketone levels and low alanine and lactate concentrations. 988 The liver glycogen synthase gene (GYS2) is on chromosome 12p12.2. 989 Glycogen synthase deficiency can present with nonspecific symptoms after overnight fasting, as an incidental finding or because of a positive family history. The diagnosis is based on the characteristic biochemical profile and the demonstration of absent glycogen synthase activity and slightly reduced glycogen content in liver tissue, which is frequently steatotic. 990 Gross, light microscopic and ultrastructural features of glycogenoses Grossly, the liver in the glycogenoses tends to be enlarged, smooth and paler than normal. GSD type IV livers have a tan and waxy with colloidal iron (green), Best carmine (red) and Lugol iodine (mahogany brown). 996 Globular, PAS-positive inclusions with a Maltese cross birefringence have been reported in the liver, skeletal muscle and CNS in several congenital cases. 966 Fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis, is a frequent finding in glycogenosis type IV but can also occur in types III 954 and IXb, c 981,982 (Fig. 3.66) . As already noted, patients with glycogenosis type I may develop hepatocellular adenomas or HCC. The hepatocellular adenomas are often multiple, and most are subtyped either as inflammatory adenomas or unclassified adenomas. 913, 997 Unusual histological features in some adenomas have been described, including a steatohepatitic morphology with marked steatosis, Mallory-Denk bodies and fibrosis. 998, 999 Amyloid deposition has also been described in a small subset of GSD-related adenomas. 998 Focal nodular hyperplasia can also develop in livers with GSD, including types I and VI. 997, 1000 The ultrastructural features of the glycogenoses are quite comparable, with the exception of types II and IV. In the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes, large pools of glycogen rosettes displace organelles, such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), to the periphery of the cell. The glycogen may be associated with vesicles of smooth ER, or it may assume a starry-sky pattern, as observed in glycogenosis types III, VI and IX. 5 Morphometric analysis in glycogenosis type I has shown an increased volume of glycogen per unit volume of the hepatocyte cytoplasm. 1001 Additionally, there is marked reduction (by 50%) of the rough ER per unit volume of liver tissue. Double-contoured vesicles in the ER are characteristic of type I GSD. 1001 Lipid droplets of varied size are seen in most of the glycogenoses, but appear to be more prominent in types I, II and VI. 5 Nuclear glycogenation is minimal or absent in type Ib GSD, in comparison to type Ia. 1002 Increased collagen deposition in the space of Disse is observed in the GSD types I, III, IV, VI and XI. 5 Glycogenosis type II differs from the other types in the accumulation of monoparticulate glycogen (versus rosettes) in lysosomes that vary from 1 to 8 \u00b5m in diameter (Fig. 3.67 ). 1003 However, increased accumulation of glycogen rosettes may also be noted in the cytoplasm. 5 glycogen. Thus strong PAS staining plus diastase digestion is not strongly suggestive of anything per se, in the absence of typical H&E findings. The presence of sharply defined vacuoles in the cytoplasm, particularly in GSD types I and III, indicates the simultaneous accumulation of fat. Perivenular Mallory-Denk bodies have been reported in glycogenosis type Ia. 992 The histopathology of the liver in glycogenosis type IV is extremely different from that of the other glycogenoses. [993] [994] [995] The changes closely resemble those of Lafora disease, 996 but in Lafora disease, progression to cirrhosis does not occur. Typically, hepatocytes in type IV GSD are enlarged and contain colourless or lightly eosinophilic ground-glass inclusions that are round, oval or bean shaped (Fig. 3.64 ). An artefactual space may surround the inclusions. They are most heavily concentrated in the periportal zone but can be found in other zones. Both the inclusions and the rest of the hepatocyte cytoplasm in type IV glycogenosis are stained deeply with PAS (Fig. 3.65) ; diastase treatment removes the normal glycogen but not the abnormal amylopectin-like material in the inclusions. The latter can, however, be digested by pectinase (Fig. 3.65) , and \u03b1or \u03b2-amylase. 993, 996 The inclusions can be nonspecifically stained GSDs, despite their variable findings at presentation, present with low or normal blood glucose levels.",

The elevated ammonia levels are a critical clue to the diagnosis, which can be further supported by quantitative amino acid level analysis of the serum. Children with milder forms of urea cycle defects who present later in life can have a history of avoiding meat and other high-protein foods. The H&E findings can closely mimic a GSD, and correlation with clinical and laboratory findings is typically needed to secure the proper diagnosis. Ultrastructural differences can exist between urea cycle defects and glycogenoses. One study found that the intracytoplasmic organelles in urea cycle defects are not displaced to the cell periphery by the abundant glycogen, in contrast to glycogen storage diseases. 1005",

            "text": "Lafora disease is an autosomal recessive and fatal form of epilepsy with onset in late childhood or adolescence. One of the characteristic features of the disease is the presence of PAS-positive inclusion bodies in hepatocytes that are morphologically and immunohistochemically similar to those of glycogenosis type IV. Two genes can be mutated in Lafora disease: EPM2A on chromosome 6q24 and NHLRC1 (EPM2B) on chromosome 6p22.3. 1006, 1007 The EPM2A gene produces a protein, tyrosine phosphatase, called laforin, whereas NHLRC1 encodes a protein named malin. At least 43 different variations in EPM2A and 23 in NHLRC1 are known. 1008 Laforin, through its phosphorylase activity, and malin, possibly through inactivation of glycogen synthase, seem to have an inhibitory activity to polyglucosan accumulation. Their deficiency leads to an accumulation of insufficiently branched, and hence insoluble, glycogen molecules, which are deposited in the form of polyglucosan or Lafora bodies. 1009 The disease begins in adolescence with epileptic seizures (grand mal attacks being the most common) followed by myoclonus (beginning in the face and extremities, but progressively involving other muscles) and dementia. Atypical cases without myoclonus or epilepsy have been reported. Axillary skin biopsy is the simplest, least invasive diagnostic procedure, with characteristic inclusion bodies reliably found in duct cells of eccrine sweat glands. Most patients die between ages 16 and 24. However, a late-onset slowly progressive form, possibly related to a distinctive mutation, has been reported. 1010 The histological hallmark of Lafora disease is the presence of distinctive intraneuronal inclusions (Lafora bodies) most frequently found in the substantia nigra, globus pallidum, dentate nucleus, parts of the reticular system and cerebral cortex. The Lafora bodies vary in size from dot-like to as large as 35 \u00b5m. They stain positively with PAS, Best carmine, Lugol iodine (dark brown), colloidal iron and methenamine silver nitrate. 1011-1015 Three types have been described. 1016 With the PAS stain, type I bodies (the most common) are granular and red, type II bodies have a densely stained peripheral zone, and type III bodies (the least common) are homogeneously bright red. 1016 The bodies are digested by \u03b1-amylase, amylopectidase and pectinase. On the basis of histochemical studies, Yokoi et al. 1015 concluded that Lafora bodies are composed predominantly of an unusual branched polyglucosan. Ultrastructurally, they are not membrane bound and are composed of varying proportions of fibrillar and granular material. The core is usually granular while the fibrils, which measure from 6 to 13 nm, radiate outward and branch repeatedly. 994, 1011, 1013, 1016, 1017 Extraneural deposits of abnormal material are frequently present.

            "text": "Galactosaemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase and first described by von Ruess in 1908. 1027 The deficient enzyme was identified by Isselbacher et al. in 1956 Isselbacher et al. in . 1028 The incidence is 1 in 45,000 births. The GALT gene is located on chromosome 9q13, and several allelic variants have been reported, resulting in varying degrees of residual enzyme activity. 1029 Missense mutations are associated with low to undetectable enzyme activity, resulting in the most profound symptoms. The 'Duarte' variant produces some active enzyme, and patients with this allele have a better prognosis. 1030 Compound heterozygotes (e.g. a classic allele with a Duarte allele) can be affected, although less severely than homozygotes. 1031 Much more rarely, a defect in the epimerase enzyme (encoded by GALE) produces the same neonatal symptoms. [1032] [1033] [1034] Common symptoms in early infancy are conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, failure to thrive, vomiting and diarrhoea after galactose ingestion. 1035 Oil-drop cataracts may be noted. Newborns are predisposed to overwhelming sepsis, most often from Escherichia coli. 1036 Haemolytic anaemia may occur early. 1035 Increased intracranial pressure and cerebral oedema may be presenting features. 1037 Neonatal liver failure with acute or chronic pattern may occur, without predisposing sepsis; clinical features include lethargy, with severe cases manifesting oedema, ascites and bleeding. 1038, 1039 Long-term complications such as mental disability, speech defects, ataxia [1040] [1041] [1042] and ovarian failure 1043 may occur despite dietary restriction. 1044 The diagnosis is classically suggested by the detection of urinary reducing substances (nonglucose), which is neither sensitive nor specific, and may be positive with any liver failure. Erythrocyte galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase activity can be measured, but the test must be done before the infant receives a blood transfusion. Erythrocyte galactose 1-phosphate levels can be assayed in Guthrie spots. 1045, 1046 Testing for the main genetic mutation or measurement of parental-erythrocyte galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase may be confirmatory. Since routine clinical management of an infant with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia involves withholding lactose-containing feed until galactosaemia has been excluded as the diagnosis, speedy diagnosis is important. Prenatal diagnosis is performed by assaying chorionic villus biopsies or amniotic cells for the enzyme deficiency. 1047 Complete dietary restriction of galactose is the only available therapy. The liver disease undergoes remarkable recovery, 1048 but neurodevelopmental complications are not necessarily avoided by dietary therapy. Dietary therapy is difficult, since fruits and vegetables contain significant amounts of soluble galactose. 1049 In addition, there is an endogenous synthesis of galactose. 1050 Longterm follow-up should be considered in peripheral epimerase deficiency. Dietary restriction is recommended during an affected pregnancy; but it is unknown whether this will prevent or reduce neurological damage.",

Lafora body-like inclusions have also been reported in patients who did not have myoclonus or epilepsy. 1024 These inclusions have been observed after vomiting and failure to thrive. 1056, 1057 Other findings may include hepatomegaly, pallor, haemorrhage, trembling and jerkiness, shock, jaundice, oedema, tachypnoea, ascites, splenomegaly, fever and rickets. Patients who survive beyond infancy develop an aversion to sweet foods and characteristically have caries-free teeth. Some present later with cirrhosis.",

Hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported in a 49-year-old man suspected of having hereditary fructose intolerance. 1072 Ultrastructural changes include concentric and irregularly disposed membranous arrays that are present in the glycogen areas of most hepatocytes and are associated with marked rarefaction of the cytoplasm ('fructose holes') 5,1073 (Fig. 3.72) . Many of the membranous formations resemble cytolysosomes. It has been suggested that these changes are related to the intracellular accumulation of substrates. Similar ultrastructural changes have been reproduced in rats whose livers were infused with fructose through the portal vein. 1073 Survival of injured cells is thought to depend on the sequestration of damaged areas (cytolysosome formation), as might occur with minimal or mild exposure to fructose. Larger quantities of fructose, particularly if repeated, may lead to more severe liver injury with necrosis and ultimately to cirrhosis. neuronal pathology.

Death usually occurs before age 15 years, with mean age at death before and after 1985 being 11.3 and 14.1 years, respectively, which may reflect improvements in patient identification, care and management. 1096 A milder form of this disease exists with complications that include hearing impairment, and papilloedema resulting from local infiltration in the eye. Death is usually from airway obstruction or cardiac failure. BMT does not prevent the severe cognitive deterioration and is not currently recommended. 1097, 1098 Enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase has the potential to benefit many patients with MPS II, especially if started early in the disease course. 1099 Mucopolysaccharidosis type III: Sanfilippo disease MPS type III comprises four phenotypically identical subtypes with different enzyme defects. All forms are characterized by coarse features, hepatomegaly, variable splenomegaly and mental retardation, but there is no corneal clouding. Type A results from deficiency of heparan-N-sulphatase; type B from deficiency of N-acetyl\u03b1-D-glucosidase; type C from deficiency of acetyl CoA:\u03b1-glucosaminide acetyltransferase; type D from deficiency of N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulphatase. 1100 The gene for type A has been cloned, and several mutations associated with Sanfilippo disease have been described. 1101 A locus for type C has been mapped to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 8. 1102 The gene for type D has been cloned and localized to chromosome 16q24. Prenatal diagnosis is available. 1103, 1104 There is no known therapy for MPS III.",

Both types are phenotypically similar, with severe skeletal deformities and growth retardation, cervical myelopathy, a potentially fatal hazard, mild corneal clouding and hepatomegaly, but no mental retardation. Late onset has characterized type B MPS IV. 1105 Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI: Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome Deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulphatase (arylsulphatase B) is the cause of MPS type VI, which has three clinical subtypesinfantile, intermediate and adult-that vary in severity. The infantile form is characterized by growth retardation, dysostosis multiplex, coarse facial features, restricted movement, hepatosplenomegaly and corneal clouding. Clinical presentation with neonatal conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia has been reported. 1106 Death in the second and third decades is the result of cardiac failure. Intellect is not compromised in any form of the disease. The gene has been localized to chromosome 5q13-14; several mutations in the arylsulphatase gene have been found, but clear mutational-phenotype correlations are not yet possible. 1100, 1107 Sensitive immune assays to detect 4-sulfatase activity may allow an early detection of MPS VI on blood spots. 1108 BMT has been helpful in this disorder. 1109 Recent studies have concentrated on recombinant enzyme therapy, 1110 which is well tolerated and reduces lysosomal storage, as evidenced by reduction in urinary GAG, with clinical responses in all patients; the largest gains occur in patients with advanced disease receiving high-dose recombinant enzyme. 1111 Long-term enzyme therapy resulted in significant improvement in pulmonary function. 1112 Mucopolysaccharidosis type VII: Sly syndrome MPS type VII is caused by a deficiency of \u03b2-glucuronidase. This rare disorder is characterized by dysostosis multiplex, hepatosplenomegaly, mental retardation and frequent pulmonary infections. MPS VII is one of the storage disorders that can present with hydrops fetalis. One patient had isolated neonatal ascites as the first manifestation. 1113 Another infant presented with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia with hepatosplenomegaly. 1114 The gene has been localized to chromosome 7q21.1-22; it appears that more than one mutation can result in MSP VII. 1100 Prenatal diagnosis is possible using amniotic fluid. 1115 In one case, BMT resulted in improved motor function and fewer infections. 1116 ",

Alternatively, addition of a 10% solution of acetyl trimethylammonium bromide to the formalin fixative is said to preserve acid mucopolysaccharide in the cells. 1119 The stored acid mucopolysaccharide is best demonstrated by a colloidal iron stain, and most of it can be digested with hyaluronidase ( Fig. 3.74 ).

The urine contains increased quantities of 2-acetamido-1 (B-L-aspartamido)-1,2-dideoxy B-D-glucose. 1135 The diagnosis of aspartylglucosaminuria should be considered in children who present with a mucopolysaccharide-like disorder but with negative urinary screens. 1136 Clinical signs include coarse facial features (which increase with age), a protuberant abdomen with an umbilical defect, hepatosplenomegaly (which regresses with age) and the heart murmur of mitral insufficiency. Other features may include acne, macroglossia causing tooth malocclusion, hoarseness and short stature. Oral complications include dental cavities, gingivitis, candidiasis, extensive gingival overgrowth, benign odontogenic tumours or tumour-like lesions and reduced maxillary sinuses. 1137 Appearing normal at birth, patients have accelerated growth through early puberty but end up short in stature. Mental development may be normal except for delayed speech until 5 years of age. Deterioration is noted between 6 and 15 years of age with development of clumsiness and hyperkinesia. Rapid mental and somatic deterioration occurs in adulthood; adults usually have an IQ under 40, along with uncontrollable behaviour and seizures. 1138 Patients seldom reach age 45. The neurological abnormalities are related to significant changes in the grey matter; the white matter is characterized by delayed myelination. 1139 The incidence of aspartylglucosaminuria is highest in Finland, 1140 where the frequency of carriers is 1 in 36, 1141 and DNA testing is available. 1132 Prenatal diagnosis is achieved by enzyme assay in amniotic cells.",

Diagnosis is established by analysing urinary oligosaccharides by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to demonstrate increased mannose enrichment or by assaying \u03b1-mannosidase activity level in leukocytes. Prenatal diagnosis is made by measurement of \u03b1-mannosidase in chorionic villi or trophoblast biopsy. 1145 The gene for acidic \u03b1-mannosidase has been localized to chromosome 19p13.2-q12, 1140 and several mutations have been identified. 1146 mucopolysaccharidoses may be macronodular or micronodular. 1121 When cirrhosis supervenes, it generally does so in older children and adults. [1121] [1122] [1123] Ultrastructural studies of the liver in MPS I, MPS II and MPS III have demonstrated the presence of vacuoles of varied size in both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells; these are bounded by a single membrane and contain some electron-dense, poorly structured material. 5, 1117, 1124, 1125 It is now generally accepted that the clear vacuoles represent lysosomes filled with acid mucopolysaccharide. Cytoplasmic vacuoles may form by mitochondrial 'budding' in the hepatocytes of patients with MPS I and MPS III. 1126 A peculiar crystalloid structure has been described in mitochondria of hepatocytes in MPS III. 1127 In MPS IV, Kupffer cells but not hepatocytes contain clear vacuoles. 1128 The ultrastructural changes in MPS IS (Scheie syndrome; formerly MPS V) are similar to those of MPS I and MPS II. 1129 In MPS VI there is moderate storage of electron-lucent material in lysosomes of hepatocytes, but Kupffer cells and hepatic fibroblasts contain as much acid mucopolysaccharide as in MPS I. 1128 Noncirrhotic portal hypertension and nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver have been reported in dogs with MPS I. 1130 The nodular regenerative hyperplasia is associated with a venopathy Mucolipidoses are lysosomal storage diseases with evidence of multiple primary defects of mucopolysaccharide, lipid and glycoprotein metabolism in various combinations. 1140, [1161] [1162] [1163] ",

Mutations in the sialidase gene NEU1, located on chromosome 6p21.3, result in the progressive lysosomal storage of sialylated glycopeptides and oligosaccharides. 1164 Two major forms are recognized. Sialidosis type I (Salla disease) is a milder, late-onset, nondysmorphic form of the disorder; patients develop visual defects, myoclonus syndrome, cherry-red macular spots, ataxia, hyperreflexia and seizures. Type II, the severe infantile form, is characterized by gargoyle-like facial dysmorphism, and dysostosis is apparent by 4 or 5 years of age. Peripheral neuropathy develops, with muscular weakness and difficulties in coordination. Findings include corneal opacities, impaired hearing and hepatosplenomegaly. Vacuolated lymphocytes are found in all cases. An increased amount of bound sialic acid is excreted in the urine, a finding that can be used as a simple screening test. 1162, 1165 Definitive diagnosis is established by demonstration of a deficiency of sialidase in peripheral leukocytes or cultured fibroblasts of both type I and type II patients. Some patients with similar features appear deficient in both sialidase and \u03b2-galactosidase, a disease termed galactosialidosis (gene map locus 20q13). 1166 Sialidase can also be measured in cells from amniotic fluid, but special fresh preparations are necessary. 1167 A mouse model of sialidosis is currently used to evaluate enzyme replacement therapy. 1168 Light microscopy of the liver reveals marked enlargement of portal macrophages and Kupffer cells, both of which have a foamy cytoplasm. 5, 1163, 1169 Ultrastructurally, hepatocytes contain membrane-bound vacuoles that are electron-lucent. The vacuoles frequently contain numerous osmiophilic droplets as well as a reticulogranular or flocculent material. Riches and Smuckler 1169 also described multilamellar bodies and fragments of membrane-like material in the vacuoles. Similar vacuoles are found in Kupffer cells and to a lesser extent in endothelial cells, stellate cells and biliary epithelial cells. 5 ",

Type II pursues a much slower course, with survival into adolescence and beyond.

Almost all patients experience repeated bouts of respiratory infection. 1156, 1157 The patients with the slower evolution are characterized by angiokeratoma corporis diffusum. 1158 Diagnosis is made by TLC of urine.

            "text": "A congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG; previously called 'carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome') refers to any of a heterogeneous group of metabolic defects in glycosylation pathways. Most recently discovered CDGs are caused by defects in three of the currently eight recognized major glycosylation pathways (N-glycosylation, GPI anchor synthesis and O-mannose-based glycosylation). 1191 The list is rapidly expanding, with eight new disorders described in 2013 alone. 1192, 1193 They are divided into type 1 (defective assembly of dolichol lipid-linked oligosaccharide [LLO] chain) and type 2 (defective trimming and processing of the protein-bound glycan). In the common form of this disease (CDG type Ia), patients present with neurodevelopmental delay, hypotonia, diarrhoea leading to poor weight gain and dysmorphism (esotropia, inverted nipples, peculiar distribution of fat). Cerebellar hypoplasia is seen on computed tomography (CT). Patients have deficiencies in many serum proteins and elevated hepatocellular enzymes. The illness may progress to death in infancy, usually from infections, stroke and/or inanition. 1194 If patients survive early childhood without diagnosis, many of the characteristic dysmorphisms become less apparent, and it becomes more difficult to recognize older patients with this disease. Older patients are characterized by nonprogressive neurodevelopmental delay with or without seizures, a stooped posture and a high risk of thrombosis. Ataxia is present in most patients. Some patients have progressive retinitis pigmentosa. 1195 Puberty is delayed in females, but not in males. 1196 Impaired linear growth is common. 1197 The characteristic serological findings are the result of deficiencies in a wide spectrum of serum proteins, all of which are normally glycosylated. Glycosylated residues on secretory proteins perform several essential functions: they assist in achieving proper threedimensional (3D) conformation, facilitate secretion of mature protein, protect the polypeptide from degradation and serve as recognition sites for some receptors. 1198, 1199 In all congenital disorders of glycosylation, the failure of normal glycosylation leads to deficiencies in the glycoproteins essential for coagulation and inhibition of coagulation (e.g. factor XI, antithrombin III, proteins C and S, heparin cofactor II). [1200] [1201] [1202] These defects contribute to the significant potential for strokes and transient stroke-like episodes. Defective synthesis of hormonal binding proteins or receptors cause the abnormal endocrine findings. 1194, 1203, 1204 There is no specific screening test for CDGs. The disease should be suspected in a patient with the characteristic clinical findings or an unexplained deficiency of more than one glycosylated serum protein, particularly albumin, transferrin, antithrombin III and \u03b11-antitrypsin. Studies for several different diseases which depend on the absence of a glycosylated protein may be abnormal, suggesting several different unrelated diseases.",

In homozygotes, low levels of serum \u03b11-AT (normal, >1.0 g/L) suggest the diagnosis of deficiency. However, \u03b11-AT is an acute-phase reactant, and serum levels may increase as a result of hepatic inflammation, leading to normal values in heterozygotes. The diagnosis can be confirmed by protease inhibitor (PI) typing of the patient. PI typing is based on amino acid variations, which produce variably charged proteins that can be detected by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels. At least 90 allelic variants of \u03b11-AT have been described by isoelectric focusing or DNA sequencing. 1235 By PI typing, the three most common alleles are M (normal) and the deficiency alleles S (plasma levels about 60% of normal) and Z (plasma levels about 15% of normal). Liver disease is predominantly seen in individuals carrying the Z allele, of whom only a relatively small proportion ever develops liver disease.",

Most allelic variants are the result of an amino acid substitution in the polypeptide chain. In the Z allele, the substitution of Lys342 for Glu342 directly inhibits secretion of \u03b11-AT, which then accumulates in the ER. 1238 The marked variation in phenotypic expression of the liver disease results from genetic modifiers and environmental factors that influence the intracellular disposal of the mutant glycoprotein.

The disorders affect secretory proteins: many of them, in particular \u03b11-antitrypsin, \u03b11-antichymotrypsin and C1 inhibitor, 1224 belong to the serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins), a superfamily of proteins whose gene cluster is located on chromosome 14q32.1. 1225, 1226 These storage diseases result from molecular abnormalities leading to protein misfolding and polymer formation, which prevents protein secretion. The resulting protein aggregates accumulate in the hepatocyte ER, with consequent low levels of the corresponding protein in the plasma.",

            "text": "Morphologically, the hallmark of Z-type \u03b11-AT is PAS-positive, diastase-resistant globules in periportal hepatocytes (Figs 3.76 and 3.77). Overall, the morphology of the globules is essentially identical for Z and other \u03b11-AT deficiency alleles. The globules represent the retention of polymers of the abnormal protein within the rough ER (Figs 3.78 and 3.79). The globules are located in zone 1 hepatocytes in the noncirrhotic liver but may show a more diffuse distribution when a liver becomes cirrhotic. The globules may show a patchy distribution in both noncirrhotic and cirrhotic livers, so the entire biopsy should be examined on D-PAS stain. Histological data are sparse, but rare phenotypes such as PI*M malton and PI*M duarte and S iiyama also produce globules similar to those with Z alleles. 1264, 1267 Likewise, histological descriptions are sparse for individuals with the PI*QO (null) phenotype. Individuals producing no \u03b11-AT would have no globules, 1268 whereas those producing truncated but unsecreted forms of \u03b11-AT (e.g. PI*QO hongkong ) might have globules if the rate of protein degradation in the ER were sufficiently slow. 1269 The S-deficiency allele polymerizes at a rate much lower than that of hepatocyte injury decreased as the children approached the teenage years. Chronic liver disease led to death in only 2.5% of PI*Z individuals by age 12 years. 1234, 1243 In PI*SZ children, elevated ALT levels were not seen when serum \u03b11-AT levels were at least 40% of normal. 1244 In another study of 85 children with neonatal hepatitis and \u03b11-AT deficiency, poor outcomes were associated with ALT >260 U/L, prothrombin time >16 s and \u03b11-AT concentration <0.25 g/L. 1232 On follow-up, persisting total serum bilirubin elevations and abnormal coagulation tests associated with abnormal factor V levels predicted death within 1 year and served as criteria for liver transplant evaluation. 1232, 1245 In a survey of children with \u03b11-AT liver disease in the United Kingdom, clinical outcomes fell into four categories. Approximately 25% of the individuals gradually improved and appeared normal at ages ranging from 3-10 years. In contrast, 25% had persistently abnormal serum aminotransferases levels but were otherwise well; 25% had raised aminotransferase levels with enlarged liver and spleens; and 25% died of cirrhosis or required transplantation at ages ranging from 6 months to 17 years. 1246 PI*MZ and PI*SZ are not associated with significant chronic liver disease in children; however, some may have elevated serum aminotransferases, which typically normalize by age 10 years. 1247 Adults Homozygosity \u03b11-AT-deficient individuals who escape severe liver disease in childhood generally are free of clinical liver disease until late in life. 1248 From ages 20-40 years, the incidence of liver disease in the \u03b11-AT-deficient population is approximately 2%. From 41-50 years, the incidence increases to approximately 5%, with a 2:1 male predominance. Between 51 and 60 years of age, the reported incidence is 15% in males and 0% in females. In an autopsy series of 246 Swedish PI*Z patients, the incidence of cirrhosis was 12%, but this increased to 19% in individuals over age 50. 1248 Registry data show that emphysema and cirrhosis are the most common underlying causes of death (72% and 10%, respectively), with malignancy and diverticulitis accounting for 3% of deaths each. 1249 Death usually occurs within 2 years of the clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis.",

In this study, the odds ratio in \u03b11-AT deficiency for cirrhosis was 7.8 and for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 20. 1250 Although the mechanisms of carcinogenesis are not clear, recent studies suggest that hepatocytes with marked accumulation of \u03b11-AT globules engender a cancer-prone state, by surviving with intrinsic damage and by chronically stimulating in 'trans' adjacent, relatively undamaged hepatocytes that have a selective proliferative advantage. 1239 Heterozygosity Prospective, non-disease-oriented population surveys do not demonstrate a risk in heterozygotes (PI*MZ) for either liver or lung disease. 1251 However, liver disease population studies in England, Sweden and Norway have shown an increased frequency of the PI*MZ phenotype in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis. [1252] [1253] [1254] It is not entirely clear to what extent the heterozygous state of \u03b11-AT deficiency contributes to liver disease in the setting of another chronic liver disease, but in one large study, \u03b11-AT heterozygosity was associated with an increased risk of liver decompensation in individuals with hepatitis C or fatty liver disease. 1255 Overall, PI heterozygosity does not appear to be a major independent risk factor for HCC.

Zone 3 eosinophilic globules have also been reported in congestive hepatopathy. 1273, 1274 In some cases the globules were either weakly positive on immunostaining for \u03b11-AT or were positive for both \u03b11-AT and fibrinogen, suggesting the globules represent a more generalized protein metabolism problem.

In particular, they can be absent or very difficult to detect in infants less than 12 weeks of age, and the diagnosis in the first few months of life rests on PI phenotyping. Immunoperoxidase staining for \u03b11-AT can occasionally help in ambiguous cases, 1275 but the stains can be challenging to interpret, because there can be background staining in inflamed, reactive hepatocytes without \u03b11-AT deficiency. Inclusions can be found in bile duct epithelium. 1276 The histological features of \u03b11-AT deficiency in cholestatic infants can mimic neonatal hepatitis or extrahepatic biliary atresia, since the most common findings are lobular cholestasis, bile ductular proliferation and varying degrees of fibrosis (Figs 3.80 and 3.81 ). This emphasizes the need for screening for \u03b11-AT deficiency by PI typing before a patient is treated by a Kasai portoenterostomy. The distinction between these two entities is made more difficult by the be present as in idiopathic neonatal giant cell hepatitis. 1277 Also of note, up to 10% of biopsies in the setting of \u03b11-AT deficiency may have paucity of the intrahepatic bile ducts (see Fig. 3 .80) and chronic cholestasis (Fig. 3.83) , mimicking 'paucity of intrahepatic bile duct' disorders. In fact, a patent but narrow extrahepatic biliary tree is often found at liver transplantation for \u03b11-AT deficiency, and a Roux-en-Y procedure may be necessary rather than a duct-to-duct anastomosis. Risk factors for rapidly progressive liver disease include a prominent ductular reaction, bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis on the initial biopsy specimen. 1278 The cirrhosis is typically mixed macro-and micronodular in type (Figs 3.84-3.86).",

Plasma fibrinogen levels are low or absent and can also be functionally impaired. The inheritance of afibrinogenaemia is likely to be autosomal recessive, but hypofibrinogenaemia may be either autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant. 1292 The fibrinogen gene cluster is located on chromosome 4q28-31 and consists of three related fibrinogen genes: \u03b1 (FGA); \u03b2 (FGB) or \u03b3 (FGG). 1293 Mutations in the \u03b1-fibrinogen gene (FGA) account for the majority of cases of congenital afibrinogenaemia, although mutations in all three fibrinogen genes, FGG, FGA and FGB, can cause congenital afibrinogenaemia. [1294] [1295] [1296] In afibrinogenaemia, where there is complete absence of fibrinogen, individuals often present with umbilical bleeding. Other complications can include intracranial haemorrhage following mild trauma, severe epistaxis, gingival and gastrointestinal bleeding, ecchymoses and spontaneous splenic rupture. Affected females may experience menorrhagia, recurrent abortions and postpartum haemorrhage. 1297, 1298 Other findings include greatly prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and thrombin time (TT). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is also very low, since fibrinogen is the primary factor affecting this test. Mild thrombocytopenia is present in about 25% of patients. 1292 The differentiation of primary from secondary hypofibrinogenaemia (e.g. drug induced) is important.",

The majority of patients are asymptomatic, and elevated serum aminotransferase levels may be the only manifestation of liver disease. Perhaps counterintuitively, some individuals have an increased risk for thrombosis due to additional mutations, such as factor V Leiden mutations, 1299 or because the fibrinogen mutations lead to fibrinolysisresistant fibrin polymers. 1300 Although histological data are sparse, the inclusions in hypofibrinogenaemia can vary in size, shape and color, presumably reflecting differences in underlying mutations. The inclusions can be eosinophilic, small and round, 1301 or can manifest as somewhat larger eosinophilic globules 1302 similar in size to those of \u03b11-AT deficiency [1303] [1304] [1305] (Figs 3.87-3.89) . In other cases, the globules are large and pale 1306 and resemble that of ground-glass inclusions seen in chronic HBV infection, or the pseudo-ground-glass change seen in drug reactions. 1026 The globules are negative or weakly positive on D-PAS. They are also positive with the phosphotungstic acidhaematoxylin stain. Immunoreactivity to fibrinogen antibody can be demonstrated (see Fig. 3.89) . Ultrastructurally, the cisterns of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) are filled with densely packed, curved tubular structures arranged in a fingerprint-like pattern 1303, 1304, 1307 (Fig. 3.90) . Rarely, inclusions of hypofibrinogenaemia may be found incidentally in patients without clinical evidence of hypofibrinogenaemia and in whom mutational analysis has not been found or investigated. [1308] [1309] [1310] [1311] Conversely, an afibrinogenic patient with proven mutation has shown no evidence of storage in liver. 1312 The inclusions are the main finding in hypofibrinogenaemia and afibrinogenaemia, and the biopsies typically do show significant inflammation or other findings, unless there is an additional superimposed disease process. Some patients progress to cirrhosis, although in afibrinogenaemia the bleeding diathesis is the more common cause of death. 1313 severe coagulopathy, as well as urinary findings compatible with the renal tubular changes of Fanconi syndrome.",

Progressive liver damage is often not reflected in routine liver tests. 1325 The earlier the presentation, the worse is the prognosis. 1326 available 1342 ; it permits immediate introduction of treatment so that most of the severe liver disease can be abrogated. Interestingly, many patients with HT1 have a mosaic pattern of FAH expression in liver tissue. This phenomenon has been explained by a spontaneous reversion of the mutation in one allele to a normal genotype. 1343 There seems to be no evidence that it could be of maternal origin due to transplacental cell trafficking and subsequent fusion. 1344 In one study, the extent of mutation reversion of the FAH gene in the liver correlated inversely with the clinical severity of the disease, suggesting that the corrected hepatocytes play a substantial protective role in liver function. 1345 NTBC (2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethyl-benzoyl)-1, 3-cyclohexanedione), or nitisinone, inhibits 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, the enzyme deficient in tyrosinaemia type 2, and prevents the accumulation of toxic metabolites (see Fig. 3 .91). Since the first clinical trial of NTBC therapy in 1991, more than 220 HT1 patients have been treated with the drug 1346, 1347 and shown initial good response, including normalization of liver function and metabolic parameters in most patients. Recent experience in Quebec indicates that commencing nitisinone treatment before the patient is 1 month old eliminates acute complications of the disorder. 1348 Long-term studies are still necessary to determine whether NTBC may prevent or only delay long-term complications, and to examine the possible risks of the drug. 1349 Of the patients who started receiving NTBC early in life, two (1%) developed HCC during the first year of treatment, but no further cases occurred among these patients followed for up to 9 years. 1350 In one patient, liver tumour with lung metastases developing at age 15 months was reclassified as hepatoblastoma after a good response to chemotherapy and partial hepatectomy, which resulted in a 12-year disease-free period. 1351 However, with late onset of treatment, the risk of malignancy remains despite NTBC therapy, and lifelong surveillance is required. 1352 Besides an increase in AFP, a slow AFP decrease and never-normalizing levels of AFP are important predictors of liver cancer development in later life. 1353 Dietary therapy must be maintained despite NTBC therapy. Corneal lesions reported in 13% of treated patients can be controlled by using a low-tyrosine, low-phenylalanine diet. The unique renal tubular dysfunction of HT1 resulting in hypophosphataemic rickets is usually responsive to dietary therapy, 1354 but it is completely reversed by NTBC therapy. 1355 However, the marked coagulopathy, 1356 neurological complications simulating porphyria 1329 and development of HCC 1333 are not responsive to dietary therapy alone. Liver transplantation remains the treatment of choice for medical treatment failures. 1349 Renal disease does not progress after LT 1357 ; however, renal impairment associated with HT1 may be greater than appreciated. 1347 Pathological aspects of HT1 have been described in several reports. [1358] [1359] [1360] [1361] [1362] [1363] [1364] The liver, at autopsy or removed at transplantation, is slightly to moderately enlarged, yellow, firm and nodular (Fig. 3.92) . The microscopic features include fatty change, cholestasis, pseudoacinar transformation of hepatic plates, pericellular and periportal fibrosis, variable haemosiderosis, extramedullary haematopoiesis and varyingsized foci of nodular regeneration, some qualifying as macroregenerative nodules (Figs 3.93-3.95) . The regenerating nodules, which appear as high-attenuation foci on CT scans, are difficult to differentiate from multifocal HCC. 1365 The nodules often show more fat accumulation than the adjacent liver (Fig. 3.93) , and some may exhibit dysplastic changes (Fig. 3.94) . Periportal ductular reaction, although present, is usually not striking. Cirrhosis may be micronodular, macronodular or mixed. 1362,1366 Jaffe 991 has noted the prominence and variegated colours of the macronodules (yellow, tan, green) (see Fig. 3.92) . Transition from a micronodular to a macronodular cirrhosis has been documented. 1359 Liver cell dysplasia, both the large and small cell varieties, is frequently observed, and the distinction between dysplastic nodules and HCC may be difficult, if not impossible. 991 cycle disorders.

            "text": "The urea cycle disorders have been comprehensively reviewed. 1374, 1377, 1378 Among the classic urea cycle disorders, the only one with significant liver disease is argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA). 1379 The urea cycle enzyme that is deficient in this disorder, argininosuccinic lyase, is located on chromosome 7. 1380 Several mutations within this gene may result in argininosuccinate lyase deficiency. 1381 The enzyme protein may be absent in the liver 1382 ; it can also be measured in red blood cells, fibroblasts and amnion cells, with substrate accumulation occurring in the fluid of cultured cells. Liver disease is manifested clinically by hepatomegaly and by serum ALT elevation and severe fibrosis on liver biopsy. 1379 Marked macrovesicular steatosis or clarification of hepatocyte cytoplasm 1383 has been noted. 1384 Ultrastructural changes include dilation of the RER or smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) 1379, 1384, 1385 and the presence of megamitochondria in zones affected by steatosis. 1384 Despite the structural changes, survival in ASA patients and in those with argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency (ASS, also known as 'citrullinaemia type 1') is much better than in those with OTC and carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) deficiencies. Nonspecific changes, including steatosis and cholestasis, have been observed in patients with CPS1 and ASS deficiency, respectively. 1383 Pathological studies of the liver in males with OTC deficiency have generally been normal. Occasional case reports suggest some mitochondrial and peroxisomal changes. 1386 Acquired abnormalities, more likely to be seen over time, are documented in females who have varying degrees of deficiency. At the light microscopic level, the mild changes include fat accumulation, inflammation, interface hepatitis and mild periportal fibrosis. 1386, 1387 Organelles in the hepatocytes usually are normal. Intracytoplasmic D-PAS+ inclusions were identified at autopsy of a neonate affected by a chromosomal microdeletion including the OTC gene. 1388 Of note, OTC deficiency manifested clinically in both recipient and donor after living-related transplantation. 1389 In the neonatal period, management of hyperammonaemia in the intensive care setting is often necessary. Long-term treatment consists of a combination of dietary restriction of protein, bypassing the defect by administering arginine and, on occasion, the use of ammonia scavengers. 1377, 1390 Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for patients with severe variants, progressive liver disease, and for some patients whose disease manifestations have proved very difficult to control with conventional therapy. 1391, 1392 Citrullinaemia type 2 is caused by deficiency of citrin, a transporter involved in the urea cycle (Fig. 3.96 ). Clinical features depend on age. In the infant it may present clinically as a conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia disorder, also called 'neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis with citrin deficiency' (NICCD). In older children it may present as failure to thrive and dyslipidaemia (FTTDCD). In adults it causes hyperammonemia and neuropsychiatric symptoms. 36",

The gene responsible for cystinosis, located on chromosome 17p13, is called CTNS; it encodes a lysosomal membrane protein named cystinosin, whose cysteine transport activity is hydrogen ion (H + ) driven. 1394 Several mutations of CTNS are associated with cystinosis. 1395, 1396 Massive hepatomegaly has been reported in this disorder, with the incidence of detectable Cytogenetic studies on skin fibroblasts from a patient with HT1 and HCC have demonstrated chromosome breakages in 71% of cells. 1367 DNA ploidy abnormalities detected in three patients 1364 may be a useful marker for early malignant transformation. Ultrastructural studies have confirmed the presence of fat in hepatocytes and the cholestasis, as well as a number of nonspecific changes. 5, 1362 In the case studied by Jevtic et al., 1368 hepatocytes surrounded a central canaliculus forming tubules; the cells were joined by many desmosomes. The basal portions of the cells were not covered by microvilli or a space of Disse, and basement membrane-like material was present. Hepatocellular mitochondria can be greatly increased in number in HT1 and may show mild to moderate pleomorphism with randomly oriented cristae. Peroxisomes are frequently enlarged and may contain nucleoids or small lipid droplets. 5 In the pancreas, about 50% of HT1 patients have hyperplasia of the islets of Langerhans. 1369 Renal changes include interstitial oedema, tubular dilation with vacuolar and granular degeneration, loss of glomeruli and hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular complex. 1368 Mouse models of HT1 are used to study mechanism of injury and potential therapy.

This is quickly followed by hypotonia, seizures, coma and respiratory arrest. If treatment is not instituted early, neurological function may be irreversibly compromised. 1376 Patients may be misdiagnosed as having respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis or intraventricular haemorrhage in the newborn period, or Reye-like syndrome when presentation is delayed. Thus the evaluation of an acutely ill newborn should include the possibility of a hyperammonaemia syndrome, more so in families who have already lost children to one of the more common urea Diagnosis in all forms is made by identification of crystals in polymorphonuclear leukocytes or by slit-lamp examination to identify corneal crystals. The latter procedure may give false-negative results in infants. Prenatal diagnosis is available by measurement of cystine in amniotic cells or chorionic villi. 1403, 1404 The diagnosis of cystinosis is established by visualization of the rectangular and hexagonal crystals in bone marrow aspirates, in conjunctival, rectal or renal biopsy tissue, or by ophthalmological examination. Phase-contrast and polarizing microscopy are especially useful in searching for the crystals in biopsy material. Because of the solubility of the crystals in water, all tissues should be fixed in alcohol, and aqueous stains should be avoided. 1405 The crystals are therefore best seen in unstained frozen sections or in sections made from alcohol-fixed tissue, and examined by phase or polarizing microscopy. Electron microscopy is a useful method of diagnosis if light microscopic examination of biopsy tissue fails to reveal the crystals. 1406 The diagnosis has been made before birth by light and electron microscopic examination of fetal tissues. 1407, 1408 Other methods of diagnosis include the determination of the amount of cystine in white blood cells or in cultured skin fibroblasts. A noninvasive method of diagnosis is based on infrared spectroscopy of hair. 1409 Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may provide a rapid detection of the 57-kb deletion in CTNS. 1410 The cystine crystals accumulate within lysosomes. 1411, 1412 The most severely affected organ is the kidney. 1405, 1413 Most of the cells containing the crystals are of reticuloendothelial origin. Crystals in many organs, such as the cornea, conjunctiva, bone marrow, spleen and liver, excite little or no reaction. In the liver, markedly hypertrophied Kupffer cells packed with cystine are located mainly in perivenular zones (Fig. 3.97 ). They have a brilliant silvery birefringence when viewed in polarized light (Fig. 3.98 ). The spaces made by the crystals in Kupffer cells can be seen on EM 1414, 1415 (Fig. 3.99) , and the crystals have a characteristic appearance on SEM (Fig. 3.100) .",

Patients are normal at birth, but symptoms of renal tubular dysfunction (Fanconi syndrome) develop by 6-12 months and progress to renal failure by 10 years of age. This tubular defect accounts for the presenting symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia and failure to thrive. Affected children are often hospitalized because of dehydration, acidosis resulting from potassium and bicarbonate urinary loss, vomiting and electrolyte imbalance. Renal phosphate loss causes the subsequent development of vitamin D-resistant rickets. Mental development is normal. 1393 Patients develop photophobia from accumulation of cystine crystals in the cornea and conjunctiva. The crystals can be detected by slit-lamp examination and are diagnostic of the disease. 1397 Hot weather accentuates symptoms because of a decreased ability to sweat. Crystal accumulation in the thyroid may lead to hypothyroidism. 1398 Dialysis or renal transplantation is usually undertaken between 6 and 12 years of age. Although cystinosis does not recur in the donor kidney, storage continues in other organs, resulting in blindness, corneal erosions, diabetes and neurological deterioration between 13 and 30 years of age. 1399 Medical therapy consists of fluid and electrolyte replacement for the renal tubular defects and carnitine to replace urinary losses. Cysteamine has been given both systemically and topically (in the eyes). Although significant toxicity is involved in using this drug, large-scale trials have shown that it delays loss of renal function, particularly in patients treated very early in their disease course. 1400 Drug-induced lupus and antiphospholipid syndromes have been ascribed to cysteamine therapy in a paediatric patient. 1401 There are adolescents and adults with more benign forms of cystinosis. A late form, not associated with symptoms before the fifth year of life, is compatible with survival well into the second decade. Clinical manifestations include retinal depigmentation, rickets, mild renal failure and accumulation of cystine crystals in the conjunctiva and bone marrow. In benign cystinosis, patients are asymptomatic and have a normal life expectancy, presumably because substantially less cystine accumulates within cells than in the had presented with portal hypertension. In addition to massive crystal accumulation, the liver showed extensive fibrosis without cirrhosis, and numerous hepatic stellate cells were seen in association with the fibrous tissue. The authors suggested that the stellate cells were activated by injured cystine-laden Kupffer cells but could not dismiss a possible role of the multiple renal transplants in the fibrosis. A patient with cystinosis treated with oral cysteamine developed venoocclusive disease that eventually required LT. 1417 The hepatectomy specimen disclosed many cystine crystals in the fibrous scars around terminal hepatic venules. 991 Ten years later, after a kidney transplant that failed because of disease recurrence, the patient presented with hepatic dysfunction, once again with veno-occlusive disease and crystal reaccumulation. 991 Additional cases of noncirrhotic portal hypertension have been ascribed to cystine accumulation in Kupffer cells. 1418, 1419 In two patients, long-term infantile nephropathic cystinosis was associated with a form of sclerosing cholangitis, which responded to therapy with UDCA. 1420 Liver biopsy specimens showed severe accumulation of cystine, predominantly localized in Kupffer cells, together with morphological features of sclerosing cholangitis. One patient showed changes compatible with sclerosing cholangitis on MRI.",

Before treatment, hepatocytes contained large fat droplets that had ruptured to form perivenular 'fatty lakes' . Ultrastructurally, the Golgi apparatus was almost completely deficient in trans-Golgi vacuole formation. Endogenous triglyceride particles could not be found, and the circum-Golgi SER was absent. During the 14 months of dietary treatment, the fat droplets in hepatocytes became smaller and less numerous, but there was progression of initially mild hepatic fibrosis to a micronodular cirrhosis. Mallory-Denk bodies were identified in hepatocytes of the cirrhotic liver by EM. Clinically, the patient had substantial hepatomegaly and a persistent increase of serum aminotransferase activity. Whether the hepatic lesions were part of the natural course of the disease or related to therapy remains undetermined. The ultrastructural findings of one reported case included fatty change, a normal Golgi apparatus and ER, acanthocytes in sinusoids and phagocytosis of deformed erythrocytes by Kupffer cells 1447 (Fig. 3.102 ). An ultrastructural study of another case by Collins et al. 1449 demonstrated striking changes in hepatocellular peroxisomes. They included pleomorphism and a broadened range of size, often larger than normal with marginal bars in some. Whether the changes were those of a peroxisomal disorder or a reflection of the disturbed lipid metabolism remains uncertain.",

Symptoms usually begin in infancy with steatorrhoea and failure to thrive. Acanthocytes are evident by 12 months of age. Neurological abnormalities causing an unsteady gait develop between 2 and 17 years. Degenerative changes affect the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord, spinocerebellar pathways and peripheral nerves. 1437, 1438 The diagnosis is suspected on the basis of the clinical features, a serum cholesterol level <1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) and an extremely low serum triglyceride level. Patients tend to be lean. 1439 The diagnosis is confirmed by determination of the \u03b2-lipoprotein concentration using lipoprotein electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation or immunochemical methods. Small bowel biopsies reveal fat droplets in the epithelium (Fig. 3.101) .",

This protein is essential for the transport of triglyceride, cholesteryl ester and phospholipid from phospholipid surfaces. It is synthesized as a heterodimer; in abetalipoproteinaemia the large subunit of the protein is absent. 1440 Mutations in MTTP were demonstrated in two patients with abetalipoproteinaemia. 1441, 1442 Treatment consists of a low-fat diet and replacement of vitamins A and E. 1443 Late manifestations include essential fatty acid deficiency and peripheral vascular disease. Supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides for calories was a common recommendation in the past; this therapy has been implicated as the cause of cirrhosis in some patients and is no longer recommended. 1444 Liver transplantation cures the liver disease and corrects the serum lipid profile, but it does not cure the steatorrhoea, as the mutated MTTP gene is also expressed in the intestine. 1445 LT in a 20-year-old woman with untreated abetalipoproteinaemia who had developed cirrhosis 1446 was followed by a dramatic rise in serum cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as an increase in apolipoprotein B from barely measurable (<1 mg/dL to 76 mg/dL). Study of apo B and apo B mRNA in cultured liver and intestinal cells suggested that the defect in abetalipoproteinemia did not involve the apolipoprotein B gene or the synthesis Patients with classic familial HDL deficiency present with a striking tonsillar enlargement with orange discolouration, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and peripheral neuropathy. Thrombocytopenia, corneal opacities and xanthomas are less common. Some patients have hyperbilirubinaemia. 1471, 1472 Others present an atypical clinical picture with hepatosplenomegaly, low serum cholesterol and HDL cholesterol concentrations, early-onset coronary artery disease and corneal opacities, but no orange tonsils; the hepatosplenomegaly and corneal opacities may also be absent. 1473 The pathological aspects of Tangier disease have been comprehensively discussed. 1470, 1472 Deposition of cholesterol esters is widespread, with involvement of tonsillar and adenoidal tissue, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, thymus, intestinal mucosa, skin and cornea. The foam cells contain birefringent, needle-shaped cholesterol crystals, are sudanophilic and PAS negative, and stain positively with the Schultz modification of the Lieberman-Burchard reaction. Involvement of the liver by clusters of cholesterol-containing cells has been noted by several investigators. 1470, 1474, 1475 The differential diagnosis from other cholesterol storage diseases is discussed by Bale et al. 1470 ",

The severity of disease is related to the gene dosage; this is an autosomal dominant trait with homozygotes affected more severely than heterozygotes. 1476 Heterozygotes have a twofold elevation of serum cholesterol from birth, with onset of tendon xanthomas and coronary atherosclerosis after age 20 years. Homozygotes have severe hypercholesterolaemia with complications developing in the first decade of life; xanthomas may be present at birth. Coronary heart disease begins in childhood and frequently leads to death before age 20 years. Most patients have mutations in the gene for low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), although two other sets of mutations contribute to the phenotype. However, similar phenotypes are described in association with mutations of APOB and PCSK9. 1477 Patients have elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein, the major cholesterol transport lipoprotein in plasma. The incidence of heterozygotes is about 1 in 500 and of homozygotes about 1 per 1 million live births. The defect is an abnormal LDLR gene. 1478 Several different mutations have been described. 1479 The gene is on chromosome 19p. 1480, 1481 Therapy is directed at lowering plasma cholesterol to control complications. 1482, 1483 Homozygotes have been managed by combined liver-heart transplantation. 1484 Reported pathological findings in homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia have been reviewed by Buja et al. 1485 In addition to atherosclerosis of the aorta and coronary vessels, there is neutral lipid accumulation in extravascular sites that include the skin, tendons, spleen, thymus and other organs. In the liver, there is accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. Ultrastructurally, accumulation of both neutral lipid and cholesterol has been observed in hepatocytes. 5 ",

            "text": "In Wolman disease, all affected organs, particularly the liver, spleen, adrenals, haemopoietic system and the intestines, are infiltrated by numerous foamy macrophages that contain cholesterol and/or cholesterol esters. 1490 Stains for lipid (Oil Red O, Sudan Black) are positive, as is the Schultz modification of the Lieberman-Burchard reaction for cholesterol [1530] [1531] [1532] [1533] ; these stains must be performed on frozen sections, either of fresh or formalin-fixed tissue. Frozen sections examined by polarizing microscopy reveal numerous anisotropic acicular crystals in the foamy histiocytes. In the liver, cholesterol and cholesterol ester are mainly stored in Kupffer cells and portal macrophages, while hepatocytes contain increased neutral lipid. Reticuloendothelial cells may also contain free fatty acids. 1534 There may be marked pericellular fibrosis and varying degrees of periportal cholangiolar proliferation and fibrosis. 1534 Ultrastructurally, the enlarged Kupffer cells contain peripheral vacuoles, sometimes within lysosomes, and large central crystal clefts of cholesterol ester. 1535 Lake and Patrick 1534 observed that the crystals are membrane bound. Hepatocytes contain many lipid droplets but only occasional crystal clefts. 1534 It has been suggested that the cholesterol esters are discharged from the hepatic parenchymal cells in an insoluble form and then are taken up by the Kupffer cells, where crystallization occurs. 1535 The liver in CESD is enlarged, yellow-orange and greasy (Fig. 3.103) . The light microscopic and ultrastructural changes in the liver of patients with CESD are similar to those of Wolman disease. 1495, 1501, 1514 A highly characteristic feature of CESD is the presence of greatly hypertrophied Kupffer cells and portal macrophages with a foamy, tan-coloured cytoplasm that stains strongly with PAS ( Fig. 3.104 A and B) . 1514 The birefringent cholesterol crystals are shown in Fig. 3 .104 C. Periportal fibrosis of varied degree is present in most cases. 1497, 1501, 1514 A recent literature review by Bernstein et al. 1506 has shown advanced-stage fibrosis in about one-third of patients. Immunohistochemistry for lysosomal proteins, including cathepsin D, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), LAMP2 and lysosomal integral membrane protein 2 (LIMP2), has been proposed for the diagnosis of CESD on paraffin sections. 1536 Ultrastructurally, triglyceride droplets are noted in abundance in hepatic and reticuloendothelial cells; most are surrounded by a single membrane. Many of the lysosomal lipid droplets have a 'moth-eaten' appearance caused by the inclusion of cholesterol within them (Fig. 3.105) . 1514 Cholesterol crystals are also seen lying free in the cytoplasm, as particles. 1486 The enzyme is trafficked to the lysosome by the mannose-6-phosphate receptor systems. 1487, 1488 The gene encoding the lipase is LIPA on chromosome 10q23.31 and contains 10 exons spread over 36 kb. 1489 Wolman disease was first described in 1956. 1490 Patients may present with hydrops fetalis or congenital ascites 1491 ; clinical presentation with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is uncommon. The usual presentation is failure to thrive with vomiting, frequently with severe diarrhoea accompanied by steatorrhoea. Physical findings include severe malnutrition, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, pallor and mild lymphadenopathy. 1492 Neurological development is abnormal. Radiological studies reveal large adrenals with calcification, a critical finding for clinical diagnosis. Examination of the peripheral blood smear reveals vacuolated lymphocytes, while bone marrow examination discloses foam cells which stain positively for cholesterol and neutral fat or triglyceride. Serum lipid levels are usually low or normal, but in rare instances they are elevated. Adrenal responses become depressed with time. Death usually occurs in the first year of life despite aggressive nutritional support. 1492 The relatively milder form of the disease, cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD), presents at any age with hepatomegaly, usually caused by lipid retention in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, and variable splenomegaly caused by portal hypertension. 1486, [1493] [1494] [1495] In children, diarrhoea may occur because of lipid retention in enterocytes; resulting malnutrition may lead to short stature. 1496 Recurrent abdominal pain may be a feature. The typical natural history of CESD includes premature atherosclerosis [1497] [1498] [1499] and progressive liver disease resulting in cirrhosis. There have been reports of pulmonary vascular obstruction 1500 and mesenteric lipodystrophy. 1501 An asymptomatic 51-year-old man with CESD and accelerated atherosclerosis developed cholangiocarcinoma and died of liver failure as a result of extensive tumour infiltration. 1502 Cholangiocarcinoma had similarly developed in a 51-year-old woman with CESD (unpublished observation by authors). Laboratory abnormalities in CESD include elevated serum levels of aminotransferases cholesterol and its esters, LDL, triglycerides and bile acids. Sea-blue histiocytes have been noted in the liver, small bowel and bone marrow. 1503 Jaundice suggests the development of cirrhosis, which may be followed by liver failure. Prenatal diagnosis is available. 1491, 1504 Wolman disease can result from a number of mutations in the lysosomal acid lipase gene LIPA, all resulting in absence of enzyme activity. 1505 CESD appears to have a somewhat different array of mutations associated with it. 1506 CESD seems distinct from Wolman in that at least one mutant allele has the potential to produce enough residual enzymatic function to ameliorate the phenotype. 1507 The most common mutation in CESD is caused by aberrant splicing of an allele due to a point mutation, resulting in the production of a shortened lysosomal acid lipase mRNA lacking 72 nucleotides, and in the synthesis of an enzyme missing 24 amino acids. 1508 Compound heterozygosity for a mutation causing Wolman disease is common among CESD patients. 1509 CESD is probably underdiagnosed, and the incidence, estimated at 1 in 40,000, is not really known. 1506 Since these patients typically present with a clinical picture of liver enlargement and dyslipidaemia, misdiagnosis as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including normal-body-weight NAFLD, is possible. Liver biopsy showing typical findings of CESD may contribute to sorting out these two divergent diagnoses.",

            "text": "Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism. Hemizygous males are variably affected, whereas heterozygous females are often asymptomatic but may develop significant clinical features with advancing age. 1567, 1568 Fabry disease is caused by a defect in the lysosomal hydrolase \u03b1-galactosidase A (\u03b1-GLA), 1569 which results in accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in tissue lysosomes throughout the body. Complete absence or reduced activity of \u03b1-GLA results in more severe or milder forms. 1570 The gene localizes to chromosome Xq22. 1571 The \u03b1-galactosidase gene has been cloned, and several mutations are associated with Fabry disease. 1572 The prevalence of Fabry disease is 1 in 40,000, although it may occur more frequently in geographically isolated communities. Clinical disease usually begins during childhood or adolescence with pain and paraesthesias in the extremities secondary to vascular substrate accumulation that affects peripheral nerves. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are common. 1573 Hypohidrosis results from vascular lesions in the autonomic nervous system. Skin signs of the disease are angiokeratomas. 1574, 1575 Renal lipid deposition leads to proteinuria, isosthenuria and gradual deterioration of renal function. Hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial ischaemia or infarction and cerebrovascular disease may develop. Some patients have lymphoedema and mild anaemia. Death is usually from renal or cardiovascular complications. Atypical variants affecting predominantly the heart 1576 or the kidneys 1577,1578 are well recognized. The diagnosis may be suspected by the combined findings of corneal dystrophy, lipid-laden and PAS-positive macrophages in the bone marrow, and birefringent Maltese crosses in the urinary sediment. Measurement of \u03b1-GLA enzyme activity in blood leukocytes is confirmatory. Examination of urinary sediment can be used as a noninvasive method for early diagnosis and monitoring the effect of therapy. 1579, 1580 on the absence or near-absence of hexosaminidase A in serum or fibroblast cell cultures. The deficiency allows massive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside and asialo-GM2 in enlarged cerebral neurons, retinal ganglion cells and autonomic ganglia. 1554 EM shows concentrically laminated inclusions or membranous cytoplasmic bodies in affected neurons, and somewhat more pleomorphic inclusions in the glia. Although hepatocytes appear normal by light microscopy, they may contain similar bodies by EM examination. 1550 More than 70 mutations in the hexosaminidase A gene (located on chromosome 15) have been described. 1555 Prenatal diagnosis is performed in most centres.",

The neurological progression previously described proceeds at a slower pace. 1590 The adult form of MLD presents after age 16 years (average, 29 years). Mean duration of the disease is 15 years. 1591 Most patients present with psychological problems, dementia or paralysis. Progressive neurological abnormalities develop during the course of the disease and include incoordination, ataxia, spastic paresis, visual disorders, tremors, skeletal muscle rigidity, athetotic movements and spastic dysuria. Hydrocephalus has been reported. Death occurs from cachexia or pneumonia. 1591 BMT has produced minor, if any clinical improvement, in selected patients. [1592] [1593] [1594] Diagnosis is made by detection of sulphatide in peripheral nerves and urinary sediment. Deficiency of ASA can be demonstrated in leukocytes, cultured skin fibroblasts and amniotic cells. ASA deficiency was used as the basis for prenatal diagnosis, but the presence of a pseudodeficiency allele of ASA made diagnosis difficult by this method. 1595, 1596 Histologically, sulphatide accumulation has been demonstrated in the CNS, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidneys, adrenals and other organs. [1597] [1598] [1599] The gallbladder is small and fibrotic and may show multiple polyps or papillomas and contain calculi. 1598, [1600] [1601] [1602] [1603] [1604] [1605] [1606] Microscopic examination reveals large, foamy macrophages in the gallbladder tunica propria (Fig. 3.116 ) that stain positively with cresyl violet, toluidine blue, PAS reagent and Hirsch-Pfeiffer stain 1607 (Fig. 3.117) . In frozen section these contain sudanophilic material hepatosplenomegaly progressing to death by 6 months of age. 1612 Type V presents with psychomotor deterioration before 3 years of age with sparing of the viscera; findings include subcutaneous nodules, joint disease and macular cherry-red spots. 1613 No therapy is available.",

Necrosis and dense fibrosis may develop in older lesions. 1615 In one case, a liver biopsy revealed numerous atypical histiocytes with cytoplasmic vacuolization which filled the sinusoids and distorted the liver architecture. Postmortem examination revealed massive histiocytic infiltration of the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, thymus and lungs. 1616 The granulomatous lesions of Farber disease have been reproduced experimentally by injection of ceramide from a patient and by commercial ceramide. 1614 In patients, neurons of the central and autonomic nervous systems are distended with PAS-positive cytoplasmic material, 1617 considered to be a mucopolysaccharidepolypeptide complex to which lipid was later added. 1615 Ultrastructurally, the histiocytes contain rectilinear and curvilinear structures in the cytoplasm, inclusions that are sometimes referred to as 'Farber bodies' . [1618] [1619] [1620] Cross sections strongly suggest a tubular disposition of the stored material, the diameter being 20-23 nm. The Farber bodies have also been reproduced experimentally in mice by injection of ceramides and related sphingolipids. 1621 Hepatocytic dense bodies and clear vacuoles have been described on EM. 1620 The former were generally round, osmiophilic deposits that surrounded that is anisotropic and can also be stained with the Schultz modification of the Lieberman-Burchard reaction due to simultaneous accumulation of cholesterol. 1602 Metachromatic granules can be demonstrated in epithelial cells of the gallbladder and to a lesser extent in those of the intrahepatic bile ducts. 1598 In the liver, metachromatic granules may be seen in some portal macrophages and less often in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes 1599 (Fig. 3.118) . Ultrastructurally, prismatic lysosomes are found in epithelial cells of the gallbladder and are composed of periodic leaflets which appear tubular in cross section. 5",

Aphonia may result from swelling and granuloma formation in the epiglottis and larynx. Other symptoms include poor feeding and difficulty breathing, which result in poor weight gain, fever and pneumonia. 1611 Patients with severe involvement have generalized lymphadenopathy, an enlarged tongue, cardiac valve granulomas and hepatomegaly.

Type IIIb has the severe visceral involvement with massive hepatomegaly, oesophageal varices, and severe skeletal involvement. Horizontal supranuclear gaze paresis is the major neurological finding. 1648 Death is from hepatic or pulmonary complications.

Type IIIc is an unusual variant with calcification of the left-sided heart valves and corneal opacifications. 1650 Other visceral involvement is mild. In type III, typical complications of portal hypertension occur if cirrhosis develops. 1651 Hepatic calcification is rare. 1652 Pulmonary arteriovenous shunts causing hypoxia and cyanosis occur mainly in patients with liver disease. 1632 There is also infiltration of the lungs by storage cells.

More than 50% of patients have mild haemorrhagic phenomena associated with thrombocytopenia. 1628 Variable skin pigmentation is recorded. 1629 Adolescent patients may have aseptic necrosis of the metaphyseal areas, and 10% of patients have skeletal symptoms that include bone pain, spontaneous fractures, degenerative hip disease or pseudo-osteomyelitis. About 60% of patients have abnormal skeletal radiographs, including the classic 'Erlenmeyer flask' deformity. 1630 Bone symptoms and radiographic anomalies seem more likely to occur in splenectomized patients. 1631 The lungs are rarely infiltrated by storage cells. 1632 Hepatomegaly is common, often without significant clinical consequences.

Glucocerebrosidase is synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-bound polyribosomes and translocated into the ER. After N-linked glycosylations, it is transported to the Golgi apparatus, from where it is trafficked to the lysosomes. The degree of ER retention and proteasomal degradation and impaired trafficking of the mutants are likely factors that determine disease severity. 1658, 1659 Diagnosis of Gaucher disease is made by assay of acid \u03b2-glucosidase enzyme in WBCs or cultured fibroblasts. Prenatal diagnosis is by assay of enzyme activity in amniocytes or chorionic villi; PCR can be performed when the genetic mutation is known in both parents. 1625 A rare variant of Gaucher disease is caused by deficiency in a small acidic protein activator, saposin C, which is required for optimal hydrolysis of sphingolipids. Mutation in the saposin gene localized to chromosome 10 leads to a variant with a normal acid \u03b2-glucosidase enzyme activity which will not be influenced by enzyme therapy. 1660, 1661 Biallelic mutations in the gene encoding for acid \u03b2-glucosidase can be identified except in those cases related to saposin C deficiency. Targeted mutation analysis can be performed in Ashkenazi Jews. 1627 Therapy for type I Gaucher disease is intravenous (IV) recombinant enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) designed to be taken up by the mannose receptor on macrophages. 1662, 1663 It results in rapid reversal of liver, splenic and bone marrow pathology with clinical improvement, but skeletal disease responds more slowly or may be resistant. 1663, 1664 The poorest responses have been in splenectomized patients or patients with advanced liver, splenic and bone marrow disease. Splenectomy increases the risk of avascular necrosis, which is reduced by starting ERT less than 2 years after diagnosis. 1665 As an alternative to ERT, substrate reduction using oral miglustat, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, a key enzyme in glycosphingolipid synthesis, has been shown to produce slower and less robust responses than those obtained with ERT. 1666 It is an effective therapy for the long-term maintenance of patients previously stabilized with ERT. 1667 Neurological disease does not respond because the enzyme does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Although stabilization or some improvement may be achieved with IV treatment in very high doses in type III disease, 1668 this does not eliminate the neurological problems that these patients ultimately experience. 1669 BMT has been successful but with significant morbidity. LT is rarely indicated and must be accompanied by other therapy to obtain a cure. 1670 Chimerism after hepatic transplantation will not reliably produce a cure. 1671 Gene therapy is being pursued vigorously. A knockout mouse model is available to assist in these studies. 1672 Histiocytes containing glycocerebroside (Gaucher cells) are dispersed throughout the reticuloendothelial system. A full surface marker study of the splenic storage cells in a case of Gaucher disease has largely substantiated the monocyte/histiocyte nature of Gaucher cells. 1673 SEM reveals microvilli, ruffles, ridges and blebs of varying number and shape on their surface. 1674 In the liver, Kupffer cells and portal macrophages are primarily affected. The distribution may be focal or zonal, with the perivenular zone being mainly affected. The cells, which can measure up to 100 \u00b5m in maximum dimension, are lightly stained with eosin, have a faintly striated or crinkled cytoplasm and pyknotic, eccentric or centrally located nuclei (Fig. 3.119) . The striations are best demonstrated with the Masson trichrome or a PAS stain (Fig. 3.120 ). Intense acid phosphatase (Fig. 3.121 ) and lysozyme activity are found by histochemical or immunohistochemical methods, respectively. Gaucher cells are also strongly immunoreactive to anti-KP-1 (Fig. 3.122) . They usually contain a small amount of iron that is derived from both ingested erythrocytes and the labile plasma pool. 1675 Other staining reactions of Gaucher cells have been reviewed. 1675, 1676 Gaucher cells in the liver may enlarge to such an extent that they completely block sinusoidal spaces. They also compress hepatocytes with progressive atrophy and disruption of the hepatic plates. There",

            "text": "Fatal liver failure has been documented in two children with type B Niemann-Pick disease (NPB), 1695 and cirrhosis with complications of portal hypertension reported in a number of adults. [1696] [1697] [1698] However, the natural history of type B patients is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly with stable liver dysfunction and progressive hypersplenism, worsening atherogenic lipid profile and gradual deterioration in pulmonary function from foam cell infiltration. 1699 The latter has is a variable increase in the number of reticulin and collagen fibres in the space of Disse. Perisinusoidal fibrosis and mechanical blockage of sinusoidal spaces are presumed to be the cause of portal hypertension, but the pathogenesis of tissue injury in Gaucher disease may be complex and could also involve activation of stellate cells. Severe fibrosis with formation of septa and cirrhosis (Fig. 3.123 ) has been reported. 1651, [1677] [1678] [1679] [1680] Coexistent autoimmune hepatitis was reported in one patient. 1681 The autopsy of a 59-year-old woman with Gaucher disease type I who died following sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiorgan failure, 5 years after starting ERT, demonstrated a paucity of Gaucher cells in spleen and liver, the latter containing a multinodular cholangiocarcinoma. 1682 Brain and lung remain affected because of poor accessibility of ERT. 1683 The ultrastructural aspects of the Gaucher cell have been described in detail. 5, 1675, 1677, 1684 The cytoplasm is filled with spindle-or rodshaped inclusion bodies bounded by a limiting membrane and measuring 0.6 \u00b5m in diameter (Fig. 3.124) . In cross section the inclusions contain numerous small tubules, 13-75 nm in diameter. Acid phosphatase activity has been localized to the inclusions by eEM histochemistry. 1684 Freeze-fracture and x-ray diffraction analysis of the purified deposits have shown that they consist of twisted membranous bilayers 6 \u00b5m in thickness. 1685 The iron in the Gaucher cell is dispersed as individual micelles of ferritin. 1686 cholesterol. By this technique, lysosomal cholesterol may not be deemed abnormal in 15% of cases. Challenging fibroblasts with purified human LDL 3 days after culture in lipoprotein-deficient media provides more consistent results. 1716 Actual cholesterol ester measurement can be performed. LDL cholesterol accumulates in lysosomes; transport to other sites is impaired. There is no repression of cholesterol and LDL receptor synthesis. For the prenatal diagnosis, demonstration of abnormal intracellular cholesterol trafficking is a complex procedure, and mutational analysis (NPC1 or NPC2/HE1 gene), whenever feasible, represents a major advance. 1717 Therapeutic trials with low-cholesterol diets, cholestyramine, niacin and lovastatin have been unsuccessful in altering the course of NPC. 1718 At present, no specific therapy has emerged for the treatment of NPA and NPB. Miglustat, a substrate reduction therapy, has been shown to stabilize disease progression in children, juveniles and adults with NPC. 1719, 1720 Allogeneic haematopoetic progenitor cell transplantation from a HLA-matched sister has corrected enzyme levels in a 18-month-old NPC patient. 1721 Spontaneous mouse models of NPC 1722 have been used to study cholesterol accumulation and cell death 1723 ; other studies of NPC gene function are performed on fibroblast cell lines. 1704 A sphingomyelinase knockout mouse for NPA/NPB is a model used to evaluate hepatic gene transfer by means of recombinant encoding of sphingomyelinase. 1724 A study of pulmonary macrophages from the same model suggests that macrophage lipid accumulation leads to abnormalities in mannose-6-phosphate receptor trafficking and/or degradation, resulting in reduced enzyme uptake. 1725 Both the liver and the spleen are enlarged in Niemann-Pick disease. The characteristic finding is the presence of large macrophages with a foamy or microvesicular cytoplasm. These are least conspicuous and easily overlooked in type C, particularly in the liver with associated hepatitis, but generally obvious in a bone smear (Fig. 3.125 ). In the liver, Kupffer cells are greatly hypertrophied and have a vacuolated cytoplasm (Fig. 3.126 A) . They are often light tan in colour due to their content of lipofuscin (ceroid). A single, small, eccentric or centrally placed nucleus is generally found in each cell. Hepatocytes also contain sphingomyelin, and their cytoplasm shows progressive loss of eosinophilia with increasing vacuolization, until they become indistinguishable from affected Kupffer cells. The foam cells are autofluorescent but have a nodular pattern, in contrast to the uniform fluorescence of Gaucher cells. 1726 The cells are positively stained with Oil Red O, Luxol fast blue and Baker acid haematin stain in frozen sections; the latter stain becomes negative after pyridine extraction. more clinical relevance than in type A and can result in death. Rupture of the spleen is another cause of death. The multisystemic involvement and clinical variability are highlighted in a broad, prospective, crosssectional survey. 1700 Abnormal linear growth and delayed skeletal maturation are common in children and adolescents. 1701 Macular cherry-red spots are detected in less than 10% of patients. Cerebellar ataxia may be present.",

The diagnosis of NPA and NPB is confirmed by sphingomyelinase assay in leukocytes, lymphocytes or skin fibroblasts. Antenatal diagnosis is possible by assaying ASM activity in chorionic villi or cultured amniocytes. 1702 Niemann-Pick disease, type C Type C Niemann-Pick disease (NPC) is clinically, biochemically and genetically distinct from types A and B. NPC is caused by a defect in intracellular cholesterol and glycosphingolipid trafficking that leads to the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in endo/lysosomal compartments. 1703 Approximately 95% of patients have mutations in the NPC1 gene (mapped to chromosome 18q11-12) which encode a large endosomal membrane glycoprotein. The remainder have mutations in the NPC2/HE1 gene (mapped at 14q24.3) which encodes a small soluble lysosomal protein with cholesterol-binding properties. 1702, 1704 The identical biochemical patterns observed in NPC1 and NPC2 mutants suggest that the two proteins function in a coordinate manner. Numerous mutations have been identified, 1705 with the recent finding that the Q775P mutation may correlate with a severe infantile neurological form and the C177Y mutation with a late infantile clinical phenotype. 1706 NPC presents clinically at any age between the perinatal period and adulthood. Its manifestations are highly variable, according to findings in a large national UK cohort. 1707 The markedly different presentation of the disease in monozygotic twins suggests the role of epigenetic and postzygotic events. 1708 Patients may have fetal ascites. 1709 Two-thirds of patients present with neonatal hepatitis syndrome. Rarely, an infant presents with chronic-pattern neonatal liver failure (near-normal serum aminotransferases low serum albumin, coagulopathy). Most patients clear their cholestasis but have residual mild hepatosplenomegaly. However, liver failure with cholestasis develops in 10% of cases. 1710 Two reported patients had biliary atresia and meconium ileus. 1711 Severe forms of NPC result in death by age 3-5 years. Other patients present later with mild splenomegaly that regresses with aging. 1710, 1712 All patients develop neurological complications. The most consistent finding is vertical supranuclear gaze palsy. Other manifestations include cerebellar involvement (ataxia, dystonia, dysarthria), cataplexy with or without narcolepsy and learning difficulties. Late changes include mental regression, seizures and neurological pyramidal signs. 1712 A linear clinical progression, independent of age of onset, has been highlighted. 1713 One patient with sea-blue histiocytes developed hepatocellular carcinoma with recurrence in the transplanted liver along with further neurological deterioration. 1714 Speak et al. 1715 recently described defect in the function in NK lymphocytes.",

The Zellweger syndrome spectrum is caused by defects in any of at least 12 peroxin (PEX) genes required for normal organelle assembly. Most common are mutations in PEX1, which encodes a 143-kD ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities (AAA) ATPase protein needed for peroxisome biogenesis, followed by PEX26, PEX6, PEX12, PEX10 and PEX2. 1736 The PEX1 mutations identified to date comprise insertions, deletions, nonsense, missense and splice site mutations. Mutations that produce premature truncation codons (PTCs) are distributed throughout the PEX1 gene, whereas the majority of missense mutations segregate with the two essential AAA domains of the PEX1 protein. Severity at the two ends of the Zellweger spectrum correlates broadly with mutation type and impact (i.e. the severe syndrome correlates with PTCs on both alleles, and the milder phenotypes correlate with missense mutations), but exceptions to these general correlations exist. 1737 Chromosomes 12, 8, 7 and 6 contain loci associated with Zellweger disease spectrum.

Serum IgD levels (>100 U/mL) remain elevated during the attack, most often associated with raised IgA levels. 1789 The diagnosis is confirmed by MVK gene screening, in particular the V377I mutation, which has been identified exclusively in HIDS patients. 1794, 1795 Hepatomegaly is common, and cholestatic liver disease has been recorded, 1793 but detailed histological changes in these disorders are not available.

Disease severity is highly variable, as are the time of presentation and rate of disease progression. Many of these disorders affect the neuromuscular system with no known hepatic involvement. This section focuses on mitochondrial disorders in which liver disease is a prominent clinical feature. Most of these are genetic disorders. Acquired hepatic mitochondrial disorders, for example, associated with toxicity of nucleoside analogue retroviral drugs or with chronic viral hepatitis, are discussed in other chapters.

Inheritance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is along maternal lines. Mitochondria are derived almost exclusively from the ovum, since sperm contain very few mitochondria. Mitochondria have their own DNA polymerase, polymerase \u03b3 (POLG, or POL\u03b3), for production of mtDNA. Proofreading and DNA repair capacities are extremely limited in mitochondria. Tissue expression of mtDNA abnormalities is complex, depending on the population of mitochondria in each cell.

Severely affected patients have profound developmental delay, dysmorphic facies, cataracts, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and anaemia, as well as diarrhoea and malabsorption, and die in infancy. Less severely affected patients have psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, myopathy and ataxia. All patients will have recurrent crises, with fever, lymphadenopathy, increased size of liver and spleen, arthralgia, oedema and morbilliform rash. 1788, 1792 Haematological anomalies, in particular anaemia, petechiae, cutaneous extramedullary haematopoiesis, hepatosplenomegaly, leukocytosis, recurrent febrile episodes and facial rashes, in patients without significant neurologic abnormalities raise the differential diagnosis of congenital infections, myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic leukaemia. 1793 Mevalonic acid concentrations are grossly elevated in body fluids in all patients because of disordered biosynthesis of cholesterol. Mevalonic acid can be detected clinically by urinary organic acid analysis. Prenatal diagnosis is possible by measurement of mevalonic acid in amniotic fluid. 1788 Hyper-IgD syndrome (HIDS)/periodic fever is characterized by recurrent attacks of spiking fever with early onset before 1 year of age, associated with abdominal pains (72%), vomiting (56%), diarrhoea (82%), polyarthralgia (80%) and nondestructive arthritis (68%); 82% of patients report skin lesions, with vasculitis histologically. Swollen, tender lymph nodes are noted most often in the demanding technically and generally relies on molecular techniques. Meticulous evaluation for a hepatic mitochondriopathy is mandatory for assessing the infant with neonatal liver failure of any type, and whenever liver transplantation (LT) might be a treatment option. 1806 Accumulating evidence indicates that many infants with mitochondrial disorders exhibit abnormalities before birth. 1808 Prenatal diagnosis depends on identification and cloning of mutant genes or direct measurement of mitochondrial metabolism in cultured chorionic villus cells or amniocytes. 1809 If the gene involved in the mitochondriopathy of a previously affected sibling has been identified, the family can benefit from prenatal diagnosis. If a family with a known mitochondrial disorder desires prenatal diagnosis, a centre specializing in these disorders should be contacted to determine the status of prenatal diagnosis of the particular disease.",

Intensive supportive care is required for the neonate with hepatic failure, especially to permit accurate diagnosis and comprehensive evaluation of extrahepatic involvement. Patients with the more delayed form of liver disease may need supportive treatment, including nutritional and metabolic strategies; neurological features may require antiepileptic medication, which must be specifically selected and monitored to avoid exacerbating hepatic disease. In some cases, use of a 'mitochondrial cocktail' has been said to improve a patient's clinical condition, 1810 but benefits may be uncertain unless a specific deficiency can be supplemented. 1811 Treatment for fatty acid oxidation disorders is customized to the actual defect. 1812, 1813 LT is controversial. In general, the outcome has been poor. Nevertheless several authors an important etiology for neonatal liver failure. Such patients die suddenly or appear to be septic. Typical patients have transient hypoglycaemia, severe neurological involvement (hypotonia, myoclonic seizures, developmental delay) and hepatic failure with a rapidly fatal clinical course. [1803] [1804] [1805] In some patients the neonatal liver failure dominates the clinical picture, and extrahepatic involvement is either not present or difficult to discern. Alternatively, the onset of symptoms is delayed such that clinical presentation occurs between 2 and 18 months of age. Liver disease is less severe initially (although hepatic failure occurs progressively), neurological involvement is variable, and some patients survive for an extended period. This second group includes 'Alpers progressive infantile poliodystrophy', now known as Alpers syndrome. A third possible clinical presentation is chronic liver disease with liver enlargement and possibly hepatic steatosis or cirrhosis; if sought, hypoglycaemia or lactic acidosis may be found.",

Hypoglycaemia may be the only sign of a mitochondrial disorder. 1807 Laboratory findings that support a diagnosis of mitochondrial respiratory chain defect include elevated plasma lactate, arterial plasma lactate/pyruvate ratio and arterial \u03b1-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio. These abnormalities may be exaggerated after a meal or oral glucose load. Urine organic acids, serum carnitine levels or renal tubular function may also be abnormal in disorders of fatty acid oxidation. Confirming the diagnosis of a mitochondriopathy can be Long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase presentation is acute liver failure without a seizure disorder. Childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (MCHS) represents another group of infantile disorders with POLG mutations in which liver failure may occur, along with developmental delay, failure to thrive, lactic acidosis and myopathy. 1844 Mitochondrial cytopathies, particularly Alpers syndrome, are a risk factor for valproate-induced fulminant liver failure, which may obscure the underlying diagnosis. [1845] [1846] [1847] [1848] [1849] Pearson syndrome consists of refractory sideroblastic anaemia, with vacuolization of marrow precursors, and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. 1850 Patients have large deletions or rearrangements of the mitochondrial genome. 1851 One patient had predominantly hepatic manifestations, such as microvesicular steatosis, massive haemosiderosis and rapidly developing cirrhosis. 1852 This patient had a 7436-bp deletion of the mitochondrial genome in all tissues investigated, compatible with Pearson syndrome. He died within 3 months of birth from liver failure. Haemosiderosis in this patient may have been caused by compound heterozygosity (C282Y and H63D) for mutations of the hereditary haemochromatosis gene HFE, but other infants with Pearson syndrome also have had hepatic haemosiderosis, one of whom was heterozygous for the C282Y mutation. 1853, 1854 Navajo neurohepatopathy (NNH) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in sensorimotor neuropathy in full-blooded Navajo Indian children (of the southwestern United States) first described by Appenzeller et al. 1855 in 1976 and further characterized by Singleton et al. 1856 Holve et al. 1857 in 1999 . The latter authors suggested changing the name from 'neuropathy' to 'neurohepatopathy' because liver involvement is an important component of the disease. They described three clinical phenotypes, based on age at presentation and course: an infantile type presenting before 6 months of age with jaundice and failure to thrive; a childhood type presenting between 1 and 5 years of age with liver dysfunction that progressed to liver failure and death within 6 months; and a classic type with variable onset of liver disease but progressive neurological deterioration. Liver histopathological findings in NNH are characterized by multinucleated giant cells, mixed macro-and microvesicular steatosis, pseudoacini, cholestasis, inflammation, bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis in some cases. Ultrastructural findings in four patients have included abnormalities of mitochondria (ringed cristae, swelling and loss of cristae, pleomorphic contour), effacement of canalicular microvilli and accumulation of intracellular bile pigments and fat-containing vesicles. 1857 The pathogenesis of NNH remains poorly understood; however, the genetic defect is mutations in MPV17, which encodes a protein MPV17, in the inner mitochondrial membrane essential for maintaining mDNA. 1858, 1859 Although the infantile form has some similarities to intrahepatic cholestasis disorders, the childhood form suggests a mitochondrial disorder, 1857 and in fact it appears to be in the spectrum of mtDNA depletion disorders. Extrahepatic features may be severe. Hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported in a child with NNH. 1859",

Transfer factors of note are the ubiquinol cytochrome-c reductase required for assembly of complex II in the OX-PHOS chain, encoded by BCSIL, and Sco1, which is required for assembly of complex IV; these have been described in connection with respiratory chain disorders. Relevant nuclear transfer factors include TRMU, EFG1, EFTs and EFTu, all of which are involved in production of complexes I, III and IV. Mutations in TRMU have been associated with neonatal liver failure 1860 and liver failure in a 2-year-old, who subsequently recovered. 1861 Neonatal hepatitis syndrome (possibly neonatal liver failure) was reported with mutated have reported successful resolution of liver disease with LT. However, in patients with Alpers syndrome or other mitochondriopathies with neurological involvement, LT does not slow the progression of the neurological disease. Careful patient selection is crucial: LT is not indicated for patients with clinically evident extrahepatic disease. 1814, 1815 Genetic mitochondrial disorders Defects originating from mutations in nuclear DNA are inherited as autosomal traits, whereas defects in mtDNA are inherited maternally. Genetic mitochondrial disorders can be classified on the basis of whether the mutation affects a single protein in the mitochondrion or production of mtDNA.",

Infantile villous atrophy presenting as intractable diarrhoea with mitochondrial abnormalities in muscle or liver may be an example of such a disease process. 1829, 1830 Various specific gene defects are known to be associated with mtDNA depletion; of these, mutations in deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK or DGOUK) is the abnormality frequently associated with liver disease. [1831] [1832] [1833] [1834] [1835] It may present as a chronic-pattern neonatal liver failure with features similar to perinatal haemochromatosis; it may also present as liver failure later in the first year of life. 1836 Other genes whose mutations may lead to mtDNA depletion include MPV17, SUCLG1, and PEO1/C10orf2, which enclosed the Twinkle DNA helicase. Any of these disorders may present as neonatal liver failure. MPV17 mutations can also present with the chronic liver disease picture of Navajo neurohepatopathy (NNH).",

Long-chain acyl-CoA esters are transported into mitochondria by a carnitine-dependent mechanism; these esters are then metabolized by \u03b2-oxidation within the mitochondria. Some of these processes occur at the inner mitochondrial membrane, and others occur within the mitochondrial matrix. Defects in fatty acid oxidation compromise energy production and interfere with formation of ketone bodies; production of dicarboxylic acids becomes a dominant alternate pathway. Hepatic clinical presentation often mimics Reye syndrome. 1812 Disorders likely to cause liver disease include defects in carnitine handling, especially carnitine uptake (OCTN2) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT1, CPT2) defects, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency and long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency, in that fatty liver of pregnancy occurs in a heterozygote mother carrying a homozygote-affected fetus, and because affected individuals may develop neonatal liver failure or have a delayed hepatic presentation with cholestatic liver disease or cirrhosis. 1866 Diagnosis and treatment of these disorders are difficult. 1812, 1865 Carnitine supplementation may be effective in some disorders and indeed lifesaving in carnitine uptake deficiency (OCTN2 defects). Avoiding prolonged fasting is critically important for all these patients.",

            "text": "Steatosis is typically in the form of fine, cytoplasmic vacuolation around a centrally placed nucleus. Macrovesicular steatosis, defined as a single large droplet displacing the hepatocyte nucleus, often coexists ( Fig. 3.129 in small liver biopsy specimens, overlapping therefore with the histological changes of other metabolic disorders. In such cases the clinical context is critical. Criteria for diagnosing hepatic involvement in Alpers syndrome have been proposed and include microvesicular steatosis and oncocytic change, but these criteria are otherwise not particularly distinctive. 1867 Histochemical examination of cytochrome-c oxidase in liver and muscle may be highly informative. 1868 Some respiratory chain subunits can be detected by immunohistochemistry. Molecular biological techniques permit quantification of mtDNA as well as detection of some deletions and mutations in either nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. Whole-exome sequencing revealed homozygous mutations in MPV17 and SERAC1 in two patients with liver failure. 1869, 1870 Some centres have developed polarographic or enzymatic methods of measuring respiratory chain activity; these and newer diagnostic modalities have been reviewed. [1871] [1872] [1873] If fresh tissue is required for these studies, patients may need to go to centres specializing in mitochondrial disorders. Assays of fatty acid oxidation can be performed in skin fibroblasts, either enzymatically or functionally. 1797 Liver biopsy tissue may be informative regarding respiratory chain defects even in the absence of obvious liver disease. 1874 Histopathological changes in defects of mitochondrial OX-PHOS have been described by numerous investigators.* All have been characterized by microvesicular steatosis (see Fig. 3 .129), variable cholestasis and ductular reaction, variable and sometimes progressive fibrosis and in some cases by cirrhosis (Figs 3.130 and 3.131) . The most detailed descriptions, including ultrastructural studies, were reported in a series of 10 patients by Bioulac-Sage et al. 1875 and in another series of five patients by Morris et al. 1877 Additional histopathological features have included haemosiderosis and an oncocytic appearance of liver cells (from increased number of mitochondria) (Fig. 3.131) . 1878 Changes at the ultrastructural level include pleomorphic mitochondria with few or no cristae and a fluffy, granular matrix 1819, 1875 (Fig. 3.132 ). Morphological findings in Alpers syndrome are similar to those of other mitochondrial cytopathies (Figs 3.133 and 3.134) . Correlation of hepatic changes with those in other organ systems may be useful. 1880 In a recent study of 17 patients with mtDNA maintenance disorders due to MPV17 mutations, steatosis (microvesicular or mixed micro-and macrovesicular) was the most frequent change. 1881 Other changes included fibrosis of variable degree, cholestasis and siderosis. Similar findings were reported by Al-Hussaini et al. 1836 in 11 patients with mitochondriopathies caused by MPV17 (seven patients) or DGUOK (four patients) mutations. In a series of eight patients affected by a defect in mitochondrial synthesis caused by a mutation in the gene encoding for tRNA 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridylatemethyltransferase (TRMU), liver biopsy in a 4-year-old child showed cholestasis, microvesicular steatosis and siderosis. 1882 Cholestasis, fibrosis and small-and large-droplet steatosis were described in an infant with encephalopathy and chronic liver failure caused by a mutation in the gene encoding for the mitochondrial translation elongation factor G1 (GFM1). 1883 In nine patients with fatty acid oxidation disorders, including MCAD and LCHAD deficiency, the histopathological findings were mainly those of microvesicular steatosis. 1884 Amirkhan et al. 1876 reported severe ballooning degeneration of liver cells, mild cholestasis and marked bridging fibrosis. Ultrastructurally, large, oval, membranebound vesicles containing a loose, flocculent material and irregular internal membrane profiles were noted. Large-and small-droplet steatosis was identified in the liver of two infants affected by shortchain enoyl-CoA hydratase (SCEH) deficiency. 1885 ",

Simple composite indices of laboratory tests have been proposed to facilitate the diagnosis of Wilsonian fulminant hepatic failure. The ratio of serum ALP (in IU/L) to serum bilirubin (in mg/dL) is typically <2 in Wilsonian liver failure. 1888 More recently, in children with Wilsonian hepatic failure, this ratio was <2 IU/\u00b5mol; it distinguished paediatric Wilson disease patients from those with acute liver failure from other causes. 1889 A further refinement for adults consists of ALP/total bilirubin (TB) ratio of <4 and AST/ALT ratio of <2.2; together, these ratios can be effective for making the diagnosis Correlation of phenotype with specific mutations (genotype) is difficult in Wilson disease because the vast majority of affected individuals are compound heterozygotes, possessing one copy each of two different mutations. In general, mutations which abrogate production of an intact functional Wilson ATPase protein cause more severe disease, with an earlier and typically hepatic presentation. [1903] [1904] [1905] [1906] Differences in clinical features of various mutations between siblings and even identical twins suggests that other genes or environmental factors are important. 1887, [1907] [1908] [1909] [1910] The only modifying gene thus far identified is apolipoprotein E. 1911 COMMD1 does not appear to act as a gene modifier of ATP7B, 1912, 1913 although there is some suggestion that COMMD1 polymorphism influences age of onset. 1914 The diagnosis is not necessarily simple even when the disease is actively being considered. 1915 In a patient in the age-range 5-50 years who has hepatic disease or typical neurological symptoms, finding serum caeruloplasmin below 5 mg/dL is highly consistent with Wilson disease; finding also a Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring confirms the diagnosis. Serum caeruloplasmin can be within normal range in as many as one-third of patients. Using receiver-operator curve analysis in patients proven to have Wilson disease by genotyping, Mak et al. 1916 suggest that with the immunoassay, a serum caeruloplasmin below 14 mg/ dL may be informative. (The labour-intensive copper oxidase method is more reliable than immunoassay, which measures apocaeruloplasmin as well as holocaeruloplasmin; its use is generally restricted to research laboratories, but automated techniques are being developed. 1917, 1918 ) Serum caeruloplasmin by itself is not a sufficient diagnostic test for Wilson disease. KF rings are diagnostic, except in patients who have chronic cholestasis of other aetiology. Absence of KF rings occurs in approximately 50% of adult patients with liver disease and thus does not rule out Wilson disease. KF rings may not be present even when there is neurological involvement. 1919 In Wilson disease, the 24-hour urine copper excretion is usually >100 \u00b5g (1.6 \u00b5mol) and almost always exceeds 40 \u00b5g (0.6 \u00b5mol). This lower cutoff has proved highly informative in children. 1920 of Wilsonian liver failure, in contrast to serum caeruloplasmin. 1890 Fulminant hepatic failure in Wilson disease may sometimes be precipitated by viral hepatitis. 1891 Neuropsychiatric signs are the predominant presentation in adults but also may be present in up to 50% of teenagers. Tremors, dysarthria, drooling and gait disturbances are frequently observed. Psychiatric manifestations include personality changes and irritability, frank psychosis and depression; some patients may present with only psychiatric symptoms. 1892 Intermittent bouts of jaundice caused by low-grade haemolysis occur in some patients. Bilirubinate gallstones may develop. Ocular findings include the Kayser-Fleischer ring, due to copper accumulation in Des\u00e7emet's membrane, and sunflower cataracts, due to copper accumulation in the lens. Both these signs require slit-lamp examination for reliable detection. Relatively common complications include gynaecomastia in males and amenorrhoea in females. Although pregnancy is still possible, repeated spontaneous abortion may occur in women with Wilson disease before diagnosis and treatment. Cardiac complications include ECG abnormalities in 33% of patients. 1893 Ventricular fibrillation is rare, with or without cardiomyopathy. Orthostatic hypotension occurs in 19% of patients, with one-third having an abnormal vascular response. 1893 Urolithiasis is a rare initial presentation. 1894 Renal tubular disease is common and may be either proximal or distal dysfunction. Less well-known complications include hypoparathyroidism, 1895 pancreatic insufficiency from pancreatitis 1896 and rhabdomyolysis.",

            "text": "Copper disposition in hepatocytes is highly regulated. Available copper in the plasma compartment is bound to albumin or histidine and undergoes reduction to the cuprous form before being transported into hepatocytes by the transmembrane transport hCTR1, encoded by the gene SLC31A1, which appears to span the hepatocellular plasma membrane as a trimer to form a channel. Near the amino terminus, hCTR1 has a copper-binding domain which contains a methionine cluster (MXXXM). 1940, 1941 A second copper transporter, hCTR2, is involved in low-affinity copper uptake by hepatocytes. The action of hCTR1 does not regulate hepatocellular copper homeostasis; however, when copper concentrations are elevated, hCTR1 is degraded. Inside the hepatocyte, little if any copper exists as free copper, apparently because it is a pro-oxidant. Cellular copper toxicity can be prevented by binding to metallothionein and glutathione. Small proteins called 'metallochaperones' mediate delivery of copper to specific sites within the cell. 1942, 1943 CCS1 directs copper to SOD1 in the cytoplasm. Cox17 supplies copper to cytochrome-c oxidase in mitochondria. Sco1 and Sco2 mediate the transfer of copper to subunit II of cytochrome-c oxidase, and other metallochaperones might be involved. ATOX1 transports copper to the Wilson ATPase. ATOX1 has a single CXXC copper-binding motif; it interacts directly with the Wilson ATPase to transfer copper. 1944, 1945 The Wilson ATPase has dual functions: incorporating copper into nascent caeruloplasmin and facilitating biliary excretion of copper. Studies using various model systems have shown that the intracellular location of the Wilson ATPase changes with increased intracellular copper concentration. When intracellular copper concentration is elevated, the Wilson ATPase redistributes to the vicinity of the bile canalicular membrane. 1946 Details of the cellular mechanism of biliary excretion of copper remain unknown. Direct exocytosis into bile of copper from cytoplasmic vesicles in the endosome-lysosome spectrum is an important mechanism. Lysosomal function relating biliary excretion in the Long-Evans Cinnamon (Wilsonian) rat is normal. 1947 Other mechanisms for biliary excretion include a paracellular pathway 1948 and direct transfer of copper bound to glutathione via a bile canalicular transporter. 1949 COMMD1 ('MURR1' renamed, once it became evident that it was part of a family of proteins) is a ubiquitously expressed protein encoded by COMMD1, the gene which may be abnormal in Bedlington terrier hereditary copper toxicosis. The role of COMMD1 in hepatocytes is unclear, but it likely plays a role in the biliary excretion of copper. COMMD1 appears to interact with the Wilson ATPase. 1950 Based on clinical experience, the therapeutic strategy of choice remains chelating agents, particularly D-penicillamine. 1951 In the Long-Evans Cinnamon rat, the drug dissolves copper-rich granules in hepatic lysosomes and prevents the development of fulminant hepatitis. 9 Serious adverse effects may occur with D-penicillamine. Alternatives to D-penicillamine include trientine 1952-1954 and zinc. 1955,1956 Trientine is a chelator with an entirely different structure from that of penicillamine, whereas the mechanism of action of zinc involves competition for copper uptake. It entails induction of enterocyte metallothioneins which have greater affinity for copper than for zinc; consequently, copper taken up by enterocytes is bound and excreted with normal enterocyte turnover. In addition to blocking uptake, this leads to total body depletion of copper by interfering with reabsorption of copper recycled though bile and other fluids",

When penicillamine 500 mg is administered by mouth at the beginning and 12 h later during a 24-hour urine collection, copper excretion >25 \u00b5moles (1587 \u00b5g) per 24 h is taken as diagnostic. 1921 This test has been validated only in children, and its sensitivity is not as great as originally thought. Thus its application has become somewhat limited. With compatible pathological changes, a liver copper concentration over 250 \u00b5g/g dry weight is diagnostic; however, lower values may be found if the sample is too small or there is variable distribution of parenchymal copper. A lower diagnostic threshold for Wilson disease, based on measurements in a large number of well-characterized patients, has been suggested: 70 \u00b5g/g dry weight. 1922 A recent study has shown that when two liver biopsy cores are obtained and one is entirely used for copper estimation, provided that this core weighs more than 1 mg dry weight, a cutoff value of 209 \u00b5g/g dry weight has a specificity and sensitivity of 99.4% and 96.1%, respectively. 1923 If the liver copper is in the range of 70-250 \u00b5g/g dry weight, further investigations, mainly genetic, are required to exclude or confirm the diagnosis. In the patient who has numerous definite clinical features of Wilson disease, therapeutic intervention should not be withheld until the liver copper concentration is reported. Liver copper <55 \u00b5g/g dry weight is within normal range. 1924 Screening the proband's first-degree relatives should include serum AST, ALT, copper and caeruloplasmin determinations, slit-lamp examination for KF rings and basal 24-hour urinary copper determination. Liver biopsy is appropriate for patients with abnormal findings. If the proband's genotype is known, genetic analysis is the more efficient way to screen first-degree relatives.",

            "text": "Mutational analysis can be difficult for several reasons: patients are usually compound heterozygotes; some mutations may be in the promoter region; and mutations must be shown to lead to a nonfunctional Wilson ATPase, a criterion not met currently by all proposed mutations. The role of mutational analysis is critically important in identifying affected first-degree relatives if the genotype of the proband is known. It can also be useful in ethnicities known to have a limited spectrum of ATP7B mutations, for example, in Iceland, Sardinia, the Canary Islands and possibly in northern Europe. However, high-throughput detection methods for analysing DNA are improving rapidly. These include denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), 1925 automated single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis 1926 and direct sequencing. 1927 A recent study from the United Kingdom of 181 patients with Wilson disease showed that direct sequencing analysis of the entire ATP7B coding region considerably increases the mutation detection rate. 1928 New methods involving microarray techniques have also been reported. 1929 Dietary copper is taken up by the intestinal cell, transported to copper-containing cellular proteins, including metallothionein, or exported from the cell across the basolateral membrane by a process involving the Menkes ATPase (ATP7A). The protein normally resides in the trans-Golgi network and in cell culture moves to the plasma membrane under conditions of high cellular copper concentrations. 1930, 1931 The ATP7A gene is expressed in most tissues except the liver. An X-linked copper deficiency disorder, Menkes disease, results from mutations in this gene. 1932, 1933 The gene abnormal in Wilson disease (ATP7B) shows 56% homology to ATP7A and has 21 exons. [1934] [1935] [1936] It is expressed mainly in the liver. Its product, the Wilson ATPase, has an N-terminus tail comprising six copperbinding sites, each with a cysteine-rich CXXC amino acid motif. Like the Menkes ATPase, this copper-transporting ATPase is also located in the trans-Golgi network. The structure of the Wilson ATPase has been determined by homology mapping using Serca1, the sarcoplasmic Ca 2+ P-type ATPase, as model 1937 ; it has also been draining into the intestinal tract. Zinc treatment may also cause hepatic copper to be stabilized by induction of hepatocellular metallothioneins, and it may have other effects on hepatocellular metabolism. Zinc action is independent of which salt is administered; dosage is calculated as elemental zinc. Compliance remains a major issue because dosage is thrice daily away from food, but effectiveness can be monitored by a decrease in non-caeruloplasmin-bound copper, regression of Kayser-Fleischer rings, improving liver tests and 24-hour urinary excretion of copper. On chelator treatment, this is expected to run in the 3-8 \u00b5mol/day range, but on zinc it should diminish toward normal (<1.2 \u00b5mol/day as target), as a reflection of decreased total body copper load. Antioxidants (mainly vitamin E) may be used as adjunctive therapy. Dietary therapy includes avoidance of liver, shellfish, mushrooms, chocolate and nuts, but dietary treatment alone will not control the disease.",

            "text": "Liver transplantation is reserved for patients unresponsive to medical therapy or with fulminant hepatic failure. One-year survival is excellent, about 85-90%. 1957, 1958 A recent study from France showed a similar survival rate at 5, 10 and 15 years. 1959 Living-donor transplantation from an individual obliged to be a heterozygote with one ATP7B mutation (e.g. a first-degree relative) is physiologically acceptable. 1960, 1961 LT for neurological complications is highly controversial and generally cannot be recommended. [1962] [1963] [1964] Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate is an experimental therapy mainly used in patients with CNS involvement. 1965 There has been some success with combination therapy with zinc and trientine administered individually in a temporally dispersed pattern every 5-6 h through the day (for clinically severe disease, usually decompensated cirrhosis). 1966 This intensive drug regimen is best reserved for induction therapy: those who improve can usually be switched to a single-drug regimen after several months. Introduction of ATB7B into the Long-Evans Cinnamon rat by recombinant adenovirus-mediated gene delivery restores normal hepatic copper secretion into the serum and bile. [1967] [1968] [1969] The pathological effects of Wilson disease are considered to be directly related to the accumulation of copper in the brain, cornea, liver and kidneys, but pathogenetic mechanisms are unknown. Oxidative stress appears to play an important role because copper is a redox-active pro-oxidant. In severe liver disease requiring LT, extensive functional abnormalities in hepatic mitochondria have been detected. 1970 Detailed studies in a mouse model of Wilson disease indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction is limited to complex IV of the OX-PHOS chain. 1971 The findings may also provide additional rationale for the use of antioxidants in Wilson disease. Recent observations show that copper interferes with nuclear receptor function, principally with RXR, not only in Wilson disease but in severe cholestasis with hepatocellular retention of copper. 1972 When Wilsonian fulminant hepatic failure occurs, evidence of massive hepatocellular apoptosis can be found. 1973 Patients presenting with acute hepatitis are rarely biopsied. According to Scheinberg and Sternlieb, 1887 the livers of these patients show ballooning of hepatocytes, apoptotic bodies, cholestasis and a sparse lymphocytic infiltrate. Typically, the biopsy in the precirrhotic stage is characterized by variable portal inflammation, moderate anisonucleosis, focal necrosis, scattered sinusoidal apoptotic bodies and moderate to marked steatosis 1974 (Figs 3.135 and 3.136 ). Lipofuscin accumulates in periportal areas, and some of the granules are large, irregular in shape and vacuolated. 1974 Kupffer cells may be slightly enlarged and laden with haemosiderin, presumably as a result of the acute haemolytic crises that may complicate the disease. There is a progressive increase in periportal bile ductular reaction and fibrosis. Variable numbers of inflammatory cells, chiefly lymphocytes and plasma cells, are seen in the connective tissue of portal areas. Changes indistinguishable from those of chronic hepatitis due to other aetiologies, in particular autoimmune hepatitis, may be seen [1975] [1976] [1977] (Figs 3.137 and 3.138) . In our experience, helpful differential clues in the diagnosis of Wilson disease (in addition to portal inflammation and interface hepatitis) include steatosis, periportal glycogenated nuclei, moderate to marked copper storage (Fig. 3.139) and Mallory-Denk bodies in periportal liver cells.",

With the use of special stains (Timm stain) and electron probe microanalysis, Goldfischer and Sternlieb 1978 showed that in young, asymptomatic patients, copper is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. In slightly older patients who exhibit early symptoms or signs of the disease, the metal is both diffusely distributed and intralysosomal, whereas in patients with advanced disease, all the copper is confined to lysosomes (Fig. 3.139) . The various staining methods for the demonstration of copper in tissue sections have been reviewed by Lindquist 1979 and Irons et al. 1980 In our experience and that of others, 1980 the p-dimethylamino benzylidene rhodanine method gives the most reproducible results (Fig. 3.139) ; both it and the rubeanic acid method are specific for copper. There is a linear relationship between microscopic evaluation of the stain and actual tissue copper levels. 1980 Copper-binding protein can be stained by of Wilson disease. Early in the disease, copper is mainly in the cytosol and is highly soluble, particularly in poorly buffered formalin; lysosomal copper-binding protein may also be absent. Failure to detect hepatocellular copper histochemically is particularly common in children presenting with Wilson disease. Of note, children with primary sclerosing cholangitis may have periportal deposits of copper and copper-binding protein on liver biopsy specimens, and marked hepatic copper overload mimicking Wilson disease has been described in children with MDR3 deficiency. 679 Both caeruloplasmin and metallothionein have been demonstrated immunohistochemically in the liver in patients with Wilson disease. Graul et al. 1984 found no difference in the pattern of staining of caeruloplasmin in the livers of patients with Wilson disease and normal adults or neonates. Studying the distribution of metallothionein in Wilson disease, Nartey et al. 1985 found that in sections with minimal tissue damage, there was intense cytoplasmic staining for metallothionein in liver cells, whereas in sections with extensive necrosis and fibrosis, there was both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining.",

All changes in the precirrhotic stage are also seen in the cirrhotic liver. In addition, Mallory-Denk bodies can be identified frequently at the periphery of the cirrhotic nodules ( Fig. 3.141 ). Variable numbers of apoptotic bodies may be present. Clusters of large hepatocytes with a granular eosinophilic cytoplasm (oncocytic or oxyphil cells), resulting from an increased number of mitochondria, are often seen. The distribution of copper is quite variable, with some of the cirrhotic nodules containing a lot and others containing little or none. 1974 Copper is rarely demonstrable in Kupffer cells or portal macrophages in the cirrhotic stage, but it is frequently encountered in cases of submassive or massive orcein in Wilson disease and other conditions (e.g. chronic cholestatic disorders), [1980] [1981] [1982] [1983] as well as by aldehyde fuchsin and Victoria blue. The granules also stain with a variety of stains for lipofuscin that is aggregated in the same lysosomes. 1974 Negative staining for both copper and copper-associated protein does not exclude the diagnosis Mallory-Denk bodies appear as masses of randomly oriented and densely packed fibrils (each ~15 \u00b5m in diameter), which are partially rimmed by bundles of finer filaments but are not limited by membranes. 1991, 1992 Lipolysosomes, which constitute 1-2% of the lipid droplets in hepatocytes in Wilson disease, may represent a nonspecific alternate route for the mobilization of excess lipid from hepatocytes. 1993 Importantly, ultrastructural mitochondrial changes in Wilson disease cannot be considered pathognomonic; although exceedingly rare with cholestatic liver disease, such changes are found with mtDNA depletion disorders. 1994 However, the presence of abnormal mitochondrial morphology in young children with Wilson disease, in whom copper studies are not clearly diagnostic, may help to confirm the diagnosis. One ultrastructural study of liver tissue from a family of nine siblings suggested that mitochondrial changes may not be sufficient for detecting a presymptomatic affected person. 1995 In our experience with genetically confirmed Wilson disease, mitochondrial changes occur early and can be informative.",

Another case has been described in detail. 1988 Ultrastructural findings in the precirrhotic stage of Wilson disease have been described in detail. 5, 1887, 1989 Of these, the mitochondrial changes are the most distinctive and pathogenetically significant and include heterogeneity of size and shape, increased matrix density, separation of inner from outer membranes, enlarged intercristal spaces and various types of inclusions (Fig. 3.144 ). Sternlieb 1990 also described three distinct patterns of structural abnormalities of the mitochondria in hepatocytes of 40 of 42 asymptomatic and 8 of 32 symptomatic patients with Wilson disease before therapy. There was no correlation between the type of abnormality and the patient's age, hepatic copper concentration, degree of hepatic steatosis or the serum aminotransferase levels. There was, however, a high degree of fraternal concordance, suggesting that the structural changes are genetically determined. Alterations in Wilson disease, other than those affecting mitochondria, include an increase in the number of peroxisomes (which may appear heterogeneous and denser and larger than normal), lipofuscin granules and multivesicular bodies. by EM and stereology. The characteristic mitochondrial abnormalities encountered in the hepatocytes of untreated patients were less pronounced or disappeared after treatment in five of the seven patients. Simultaneously, relative mitochondrial volume, surface density of the external mitochondrial membranes and number of these profiles per unit area increased, whereas abnormal elevations of serum aminotransferases returned to normal.",

In 30-50% of patients with ICC, there is a history of sibling disease and death, but Mendelian inheritance is not apparent. Evidence against a genetic background for the disease is its apparent absence in South Asian expatriates in the United Kingdom, Africa and North America. 2003 Three clinical stages of ICC have been recognized 2002 : (1) an early stage with an insidious onset characterized by disturbances of appetite and bowel movement, slight enlargement of the liver and occasional jaundice; (2) an intermediate stage characterized by irritability, minimal jaundice, marked hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and occasionally, subcutaneous oedema, ascites and susceptibility to infection; and (3) a late stage with increasing jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly and progression to hepatic failure and death.",

Steatosis is conspicuously absent (Fig. 3.145) . The mesenchymal reaction is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration (lymphocytes, histiocytes, neutrophils and a few plasma cells), variable periportal ductular reaction, progressive fibrosis and eventually development of a micronodular cirrhosis (Fig. 3.146) . Regenerative activity appears absent. 2004 ICC is associated with marked hepatic copper overload (Fig. 3.147) . The copper storage has been demonstrated histochemically (by staining tissue sections with orcein for copper-binding protein and using the rhodanine method for copper) and by quantitative techniques such as atomic absorption spectrophotometry. 2000, 2001, 2005, 2006 It is now generally accepted that the copper storage is directly responsible for the histopathological lesions in ICC. The copper accumulates first in periportal hepatocytes and then extends toward the terminal hepatic venules. Orcein stain may also have diagnostic utility. 2007 In 1983 , Tanner et al. 2008 proposed that increased dietary copper (from copper-contaminated milk stored in brass and copper containers) could be of aetiological significance in ICC. Subsequently, O'Neill and Tanner 2009 demonstrated experimentally that copper (but not zinc) is avidly taken up from brass and bound to casein, from which copper is completely removable by picolinate chelation. They concluded that milk is an effective carrier of copper from a brass utensil to the infant enterocyte. Several studies of clinical recovery, improved long-term survival and even reversal of the hepatic histological lesions by penicillamine therapy in infants with ICC provide evidence for a direct cytopathic effect of copper.

Many of these disorders are X-linked, and males are more likely to be affected. They manifest clinically with infections and/or malignancy, and dysregulated immunity in the form of autoimmunity, autoinflammation and/or allergy. Infections of the upper and/or lower respiratory tract or gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as diarrhoea are common clinical presentations. 2020 Recurrent infections affecting multiple sites, of prolonged duration and unusual intensity, and by unusual organisms should raise suspicion of a primary immunodeficiency (PI). Susceptibility to specific organisms is a characteristic of some PIs. Acquired disorders or other conditions such as drug-related immunosuppression, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or cystic fibrosis need to be excluded in the first instance. Liver involvement in patients can occur for various reasons: directly as a result of the PI, or as a consequence of medical therapy or in connection with haematopoietic cell transplantation. The most common manifestation is sclerosing cholangitis, often related to Cryptosporidium infection. Liver abscesses, granulomatous inflammation, autoimmune hepatitis and nodular regenerative hyperplasia have also been described. The most recent classification 2021 divides the PI disorders into nine categories (Table 3 .7). The reader is referred to this classification; a more detailed description of these disorders is beyond the scope of this chapter. Only the main conditions associated with liver involvement are discussed here.",

            "text": "Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is characterized by recurrent purulent infections caused by bacteria (usually catalase-positive) or fungi. The onset is generally before 1 year of age, although milder forms may present in adulthood. Marked lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are common findings. 2022 Liver abscess occurred in approximately one-third of 268 patients with CGD, 2023 and Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated organism. In CGD, antimicrobial activity of phagocytes is impaired due to the lack of reactive oxygen species, or oxidative burst, normally produced by NADPH oxidase. The most common X-linked form of CGD represents 70% of all cases. 2024 Autosomal recessive forms are considerably rarer. CGD is caused by mutations in the cytochrome-b \u03b2-subunit (CYBB) gene, which maps to chromosome Xp21, 2025 cloned in 1986, 2025 and encoding the gp91-phox (phagocyte oxidase) protein, a necessary component in the NADPH oxidase pathway. 2026, 2027 It is currently classified in the category of defects in intrinsic and innate immunity. 2021 Mutations in the CYBB gene responsible for CGD have been described, permitting prenatal diagnosis. 2028 Assessment of defective granulocyte function by flow cytometry can be used in neonates. 2029 Patients are screened for CGD by the nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction assay. 2030 Although some CGD patients respond to interferon-\u03b3 therapy, this has not been a useful long-term treatment. 2031 Radical surgery is recommended for liver abscess. 2032 BMT was helpful in one case. 2033 Granulocyte transfusions from healthy donors given G-CSF subcutaneously and dexamethasone orally 12 hours before collection have helped to eradicate occurrence of invasive aspergillosis. 2034 Recently, stem cell transplantation with a reduced-intensity conditioning protocol has been followed by full donor chimerism and normalization of superoxide production. 2035 Gene therapy, including ex vivo protocols, are promising 2036 and the subject of intense investigation in murine models. [2037] [2038] [2039] The characteristic pathological features of CGD are the granulomatous response to infection and the widespread accumulation of lipofuscin pigment in reticuloendothelial cells [2040] [2041] [2042] [2043] (Fig. 3.148 A) . high levels of copper ('hepatic copper toxicosis') are discussed in Chapter 12. The decline in the incidence of ICC since feeding practices have been changed to avoid the use of copper vessels for infants and young children, and the continued remission of affected children after discontinuing penicillamine once sufficient hepatic copper has been removed, suggest that environmental factors are important in the development of ICC. Developmental and genetic factors cannot be entirely excluded. 2013 Studies indicate that COMMD1, the gene abnormal in Bedlington terrier hereditary copper toxicosis, does not play a role in either ICC or Tyrolean infantile cirrhosis. 2014 A disorder resembling ICC has been described in Indian children 5-15 years old. 2015 The disorder differs from classic ICC because of its late clinical presentation and relatively slow progression of liver damage. It differs from Wilson disease in that serum caeruloplasmin is in normal range or elevated and 24-hour basal urinary copper excretion is only moderately increased (0.8-2.5 \u00b5mol/24 h). Liver biopsy shows no steatosis; micronodular cirrhosis may be present. It is not clear whether this is a different disorder or a milder presentation of ICC. Its genetic basis is not known.",

The defect is caused by mutations in the gene encoding for CD40 ligand, located on chromosome Xq 26.3-27. It is currently classified in the category of 'immunodeficiencies affecting cellular and humoral immunity' . 2021 XHIM is a cellular immunodeficiency characterized by disruption of multiple cellular interactions (e.g. T cells-B cells, T cellsmacrophages). Patients are unable to mount IgG, IgA and IgE responses to T-cell-dependent antigens and lack germinal centres, but their ability to produce IgM is preserved. Infections are the most prominent clinical manifestations of XHIM. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections (the latter frequently caused by Pneumocystis carinii), chronic diarrhoea and liver involvement (both caused by Cryptosporidium infections) are common. 2055 Many patients have chronic neutropenia associated with oral and rectal ulcers. An example of cryptosporidiosis in a 15-year-old male with XHIM (diagnosed Small granulomas consist of rings of mononuclear cells which surround an area of homogeneous eosinophilic material and are associated with many plasma cells and a few giant cells. 2044 Confluent granulomas may show larger areas of necrosis and suppuration. Palisading granulomas with central necrosis and associated giant cells were noted in four of seven cases reported by Nakhleh et al. 2045 Special stains for microorganisms are usually negative, unless the granulomas are caused by fungi. 2046 The pigmented histiocytes have a light-tan colour and are PAS positive, argentophilic, sudanophilic (in frozen sections) and autofluorescent (Fig. 3.148 B) . The accumulation of the pigment is thought to be a secondary phenomenon. 2047 In the liver, most of the lipofuscin is found in clusters of greatly hypertrophied portal macrophages or Kupffer cells. Portal areas are infiltrated by plasma cells and lymphocytes, and there may be minimal to moderate fibrosis. A hepar lobatum-like cirrhotic process was described in one patient. 2048 Varying numbers of granulomas and microabscesses may be scattered within the parenchyma, and there may be slight to moderate portal inflammation and fatty change (Fig. 3.149) . haemopoietic stem cells from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors is feasible and curative if performed before significant infections and organ damage occur. 2060 Successful sequential liver and BMT has been reported. 2056, 2059 Histiocytic and haemophagocytic syndromes",

Hepatosplenomegaly is typically prominent early, and jaundice may develop later. 2065 Extremely abnormal coagulation studies reflect low fibrinogen levels and thrombocytopenia, but other coagulation factors are normal. Neurological symptoms may develop from histiocytic involvement of the brain. Although clinical manifestations may remit temporarily, the disease is eventually fatal. The diagnosis is based on identifying erythrophagocytosis by histiocytes in bone marrow biopsy material or occasionally on liver biopsy. Perforin expression by peripheral lymphocytes, assessment of 2B4 lymphocyte receptor, and natural killer (NK) cell activity have been proposed as rapid tests to assist differentiating FLH from HLH subtypes, therefore highlighting patients with a poor prognosis who may benefit from BMT. 2061 In an autopsy series, haemophagocytosis was most often observed in the spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow. 2066 Hepatic involvement is characterized by hypertrophy of Kupffer cells and portal macrophages, which manifest striking erythrophagocytosis (Fig. 3.151 ), but this may be inconspicuous or even absent. 2067 In 19 patients, hepatic histology showed portal and sinusoidal infiltrates of CD3, CD8, granzyme B+ lymphocytes admixed with CD68, CD1a\u2212ve histiocytes, with haemophagocytosis in all specimens. 2068 Portal areas may show lymphohistiocytic infiltrates with a predominance of T lymphocytes, in a pattern reminiscent of chronic hepatitis (Fig. 3.151 ). In some cases there is striking enlargement of endothelial cell nuclei and perivenous erythropoiesis resembling graft rejection. 2067 Other changes include mild hepatocellular damage in the vicinity of the lymphohistiocytic infiltrates, variable cholestasis and epithelioid granulomas. 2067",

            "text": "In haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), also known as infection-associated (reactive) haemophagocytic syndrome, there is proliferation of morphologically nonmalignant histiocytes showing phagocytosis of haemopoietic cells, with associated fever and pancytopenia. Clinical severity ranges from the incidental observation during infection or findings at autopsy that macrophages throughout the body are large and activated to the full-blown haemophagocytic syndrome (HLH), which includes fever, hepatosplenomegaly, coagulopathy and various cytopenias. 2069 HLH can manifest as acute liver failure. 2070, 2071 It can also present as neonatal liver failure; since FLH often shows very high serum ferritin levels, distinction from so-called neonatal haemochromatosis can be difficult. 2072, 2073 Tissue specimens are critical in distinguishing these two diseases because LT is contraindicated in FHL, whereas it might be lifesaving in neonatal haemochromatosis. 2073 Epstein-Barr virus infection (virus-associated haemophagocytic syndrome) remains the most frequent association with HLH, but since the first report in 1979, many other viruses 2074, 2075 and other infectious agents have been incriminated. 2076, 2077 There are a few reports of simultaneous development of HLH and SLE. 2078 Patients with rheumatic disorders, especially juvenile chronic arthritis, appear particularly at risk; the condition is often referred to as macrophage activation syndrome in this setting. 2079, 2080 Haemophagocytic features are often seen in livers of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Fig. 3.152 ). The haemophagocytic syndrome may also develop in diseases other than infections, such as lymphoma and disseminated carcinoma. 2081, 2082 In about one-fifth of patients, according to a large recent series of 103 cases, there was no association with an underlying specific disorder. 2083 Reactive (secondary) HLH and macrophage activation syndrome manifest as a massive cytokine and chemokine release, mostly TNF\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, IL-6 and other cytokines whose levels in the blood may have a prognostic value. 2084 This cytokine profile distinguishes HLH from the primary familial conditions in which an underlying genetic defect is identified. In contrast, NK-cell function is preserved in the reactive form but defective in the inherited syndromes. 2069 Histologically, there is infiltration of the portal tracts with normalappearing histiocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells. Sinusoidal changes are prominent and include sinusoidal congestion and increase in size and number of Kupffer cells, which display prominent haemophagocytosis. In a series of 30 patients with haemophagocytic syndrome, haemophagocytosis was seen in all patients. 2085 In 16 patients, erythrophagocytosis was associated with intracytoplasmic B A accumulation of haemosiderin or bile. Haemophagocytosis was not seen in portal tracts. The Kupffer cells are only weakly stained with PAS, a feature helpful in distinguishing this change from a response to necroinflammatory conditions, in which the Kupffer cells are often strongly PAS positive. 2086 Additionally, Kupffer cells frequently show siderosis, possibly related to the erythrophagocytosis itself or to blood transfusions. 2086 Correlation is lacking between the degree of peripheral cytopenia and the degree of hepatic haemophagocytosis. 2086 Immunohistochemical findings on liver tissues have provided direct evidence for the involvement of activated CD8+ lymphocytes through the production of IFN-\u03b3, and of macrophages through the haemophagocytosis and production of both IL-6 and TNF\u03b1, irrespective of the associated condition. 2087 Prendki et al. 2088 have proposed a reduced perforin-positive/CD3-positive lymphocyte ratio as an indicator of haemophagocytosis.",

In most instances, gross evidence of disease was lacking, except for one case in which a 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed white nodule was found in the right lobe of the liver. 2127 The hallmark of Rosai-Dorfman disease is the proliferation of histiocytes, which have an abundant cytoplasm and normal-appearing nuclei ( Fig. 3.163 A and B) . The cells are seen in portal areas and in hepatic sinusoids. They display avid leucophagocytosis, but can also phagocytose RBCs. According to Eisen et al., 2130 Although patients with LCH have a good overall prognosis, 2113 approximately 20% of patients with multisystem involvement will show a progressive disease course despite treatment. 2114, 2115 In particular, patients with hepatic involvement have a worse prognosis with survival at 3 years of 96.7% for those without, but only 51.8% for those with liver involvement. 2116 In patients with cirrhosis and end-stage liver failure due to LCH sclerosing cholangitis, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has been proven a successful therapeutic option, 2102, 2117, 2118 with 67% of patients living long-term after surgery (median follow-up, 5.8 years; range, 2.1-7.5 years). A significant number of LCH patients have developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, apparently related to a higher incidence of refractory rejection. 2119 Disease recurrence in the liver allograft occurs in about 30% of patients and seems easily managed. 2119, 2120 Chemotherapy protocols are chosen on the basis of disease distribution and extent. 2104 Juvenile xanthogranuloma, a histiocytic disorder, is primarily but not exclusively seen throughout the first two decades of life and principally as a solitary cutaneous lesion. It can manifest with multiple small systemic lesions (xanthoma disseminatum), in which case the liver can occasionally be involved. The infiltrating cells are factor XIIIa, fascin and CD68 and CD163 positive among various markers, 2121 but S-100, langerin and CD1a negative. 2098, 2122 Touton cells are rarely seen in extracutaneous sites. There appears to be an overlap with LCH because skin lesions with characteristics of juvenile xanthogranuloma may be found in children with LCH. 2069 Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare, non-Langerhans type of histiocytosis with xanthogranulomas. It appears to be neoplastic. 2123 Liver involvement is uncommon; biliary tract obstruction has been reported. 2124, 2125 named SBDS, which encodes a ribosomal protein involved in ribosomal and other cellular processes. 2149, 2150 Disease-causing SBDS mutations are found in approximately 90% of patients.",

Familial occurrence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with or without cirrhosis, or with cryptogenic cirrhosis, was reported by Struben et al. 2170 in 18 members of eight kindreds. Fifteen (83%) of the 18 were obese, and 11 (31%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus. The occurrence of these disorders within kindreds suggested a common pathogenesis and possible genetic risk. Other cases of familial cirrhosis 2171, 2172 or cryptogenic cirrhosis with a family history of unexplained liver disease (19% of patients in series of Caldwell et al. 2173 ) have been reported. Susceptibility to NAFLD has been shown to be associated with polymorphism in the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) gene, encoding adiponutrin. [2174] [2175] [2176] Glucose regulatory protein (GCKR) has been associated with fatty liver in obese children, 2177 and transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2) polymorphisms may also be important in children. 2178 Various other genes have been implicated. 2179 Various genetic disorders produce a NAFLD-or NASH-like liver disorder. Steatohepatitis 2180 and cirrhosis 2181 have been reported in associated with lysosomal activity (lysozyme, \u03b11-antitrypsin, \u03b11antichymotrypsin); antigens associated with early inflammation (Mac-387, 27E10); antigens commonly found on monocytes, but not tissue macrophages (OKM5, Leu-M1); and activation antigens (Ki-1, receptors for transferrin and IL-2). They are negative for CD1a and langerin. 2098 The cells thus appear to be true, functionally activated macrophages derived recently from circulating monocytes. 2130 ",

Routine methods may fail to detect anti-Ro and anti-La in the infant; these studies should be performed at as young an age as possible. Very high titres of antinuclear antigen (ANA) in the infant may be caused by NLE. Deposits of associated antibodies (anti-Ro and/or anti-La) may be found in affected liver tissue by immunofluorescence. 2144 Most infants with unexplained neonatal hepatitis syndrome do not have NLE. 2145 One infant was reported with neonatal hepatitis syndrome and transplacental transfer of antimitochondrial antibodies. 2146 The disease mechanism is similar to that of gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD) in that transplacental passage of antibodies causes neonatal liver disease with iron accumulation; however, NLE is milder and tends to be self-limited.",

Disease-associated mutations have been identified in the gene associated with SDS, by Ruchelli et al. 2204 Arai et al. 2210 have suggested that megakaryocytederived TGF\u03b21 is one of the candidates in the activation of hepatic stellate cells leading to the hepatic fibrosis. High levels of N-terminal peptide of procollagen III, type IV collagen and hyaluronic acid were found in the serum of a lethal case at 5 days of life. 2212 The liver disease generally accompanies a haematological disorder unique to Down syndrome called transient abnormal myelopoiesis, transient myeloproliferative disorder or transient leukaemia. 2213, 2214 The condition consists of a clonal proliferation of blast cells exhibiting megakaryocytic features and historically associated with a high rate of spontaneous remission. Its true incidence remains to be determined. A number of cases may occur as an incidental finding of abnormal cell counts and blast cells in the peripheral blood in an otherwise well child, but in approximately 20% of cases the disease is manifest as hydrops fetalis and liver or multiorgan failure resulting in death. Of those children who enter a spontaneous remission, 13-33% have been found to develop acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AMKL), usually within the first 3 years of life, which if left untreated is fatal. In trisomy 21, fetal haemopoietic progenitors acquire N-terminal truncating mutations in the key megakaryocyte-erythroid transcription factor GATA1. Mutations are found in blast cells of both transient myeloproliferative disorder and megakaryoblastic leukaemia, 2215 suggesting that additional as yet unidentified (epi)genetic mutations are required for progression to AMKL. 2216 A recent multicentre survey suggests a good response of leukaemic patients to early therapy with standard-dose intensive chemotherapy, including cytarabine and anthracyclines. 2217 Neonatal hepatitis syndrome can occur in children with Down syndrome in the absence of transient abnormal myelopoiesis or leukaemia. Generally, these children also have congenital heart disease or GI abnormalities. 2218 This population study suggests that the incidence of neonatal hepatitis syndrome in children with Down syndrome is unexpectedly high (3.9%) and that conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is more severe in those with transient abnormal myelopoiesis.",

Initial symptoms include vomiting (usually repetitive), lethargy patients with partial lipodystrophy. NASH is also reported in children with Bardet-Biedl syndrome and in both children and adults with Alstr\u00f6m syndrome, [2182] [2183] [2184] in whom cirrhosis may occur. Steatohepatitis (sclerosing hyaline necrosis) was also described in a patient with Bloom syndrome. 2185 This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by a normally proportioned but strikingly small body size, characteristic facies, photosensitive skin lesions, immunodeficiency and marked predisposition to a variety of cancers and some evidence of disordered insulin action. Likewise, there are multiple reports of marked hepatic steatosis (but no steatohepatitis or cirrhosis) in patients with Dorfman-Chanarin syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by marked hepatic steatosis, ichthyosis and variable CNS and muscle involvement. 2186, 2187 Other rare disorders with NAFLD-like liver disease include mulibrey nanism 2188 and Cohen syndrome. 2189 Hepatotoxicity and other known genetic/metabolic diseases that can cause fatty liver, such as Wilson disease and cystic fibrosis, must be excluded because treatment is radically different. 2190 Although these diseases clearly can manifest a 'nonalcoholic' steatosis, they are neither NAFLD nor NAFLD-like.",

[2204] [2205] [2206] Stillbirth, hydrops fetalis or neonatal liver failure at or within a few weeks of birth are recognized presentations. [2207] [2208] [2209] [2210] [2211] Morphologically, there is diffuse fibrosis surrounding reactive bile ductules and residual hepatocytes. 2204 Extensive hepatic necrosis has also been observed. In most livers a large number of megakaryocytes or megakaryoblasts, staining positively for factor VIII-related antigen and binding to Ulex europaeus 1, as well as other haematopoietic elements, are present in the sinusoids. 2204, 2207 Parenchymal iron deposition of variable degree was noted in most of the cases studied and changes in mental status. Hepatic dysfunction can be overlooked since the liver is minimally enlarged, and there is no jaundice or splenomegaly. Subsequent symptoms and signs are predominantly neurological and terminate in coma. Seizures sometimes occur, particularly in younger children with hypoglycaemia. Most patients have received multiple medications, including aspirin, for the symptoms of the viral illness. Initial laboratory screening tests disclose elevated serum aminotransferase levels, hyperammonaemia and coagulopathy. Although the liver disease is benign and transient, the encephalopathy (secondary to a hypoxic/metabolic insult resulting in cerebral oedema) can be life threatening and can result in permanent neurological disability. 2220 Early diagnosis based on clinical findings and liver biopsy, along with meticulous supportive care, results in decreased mortality and morbidity.",

The lipid droplets are consistently smaller in the perivenular zone than in other areas. 2229 Vacuolization may not be evident in biopsy material obtained less than 24 hours after the onset of encephalopathy, even though appropriately stained frozen sections will reveal an abundance of fat. Nuclei of the liver cells are enlarged and centrally located. Mitotic activity of variable degree may be seen. Hepatocellular necrosis is generally absent or is mild and spotty. Periportal necrosis is occasionally found, 2230 preceded by ballooning degeneration of periportal hepatocytes. Variation in the severity of glycogen depletion of liver cells in early biopsies correlates with other histological measures of severity, and with the occurrence of hypoglycaemia, severity of encephalopathy at admission and the mortality rate. Portal inflammation is either minimal or absent. Cholestasis is rarely observed; in some instances it may be related to an associated pancreatitis. 2231 Reduction of succinic dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase activities (and other mitochondrial enzymes) has been demonstrated by enzymatic stains and is most helpful in confirming the diagnosis 5 ( Fig. 3.165 B) .",

The degree of enlargement correlates to some extent with the stage of encephalopathy. 2232 The severity of Reye syndrome may also be correlated with lucency of the mitochondrial matrix and loss of matrical dense bodies (Fig. 3.166 ). Other mitochondrial changes in initial hepatic biopsy specimens from patients who die or have severe neurological sequelae include a decrease in size and number of cristae. There may be an increase in the amount of smooth endoplasmic reticulum with varying degrees of dilation, and 50% of hepatic biopsy specimens reveal flocculent peroxisomes. 2233 Microvesicular steatosis has been reported in several inherited metabolic disorders and in drug-and toxin-induced liver injury, such as with tetracycline, nucleoside analogues, aflatoxin, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, margosa oil, hypoglycin A, pentanoic acid and valproic acid (see Chapter 12) . Aspirin toxicity may mimic Reye syndrome. 2233 At the light microscopic level, the liver findings in children with fatal salicylate intoxication resemble those of Reye syndrome, 2234 but the ultrastructural changes appear to be different. 2232 Animal models of Reye syndrome with encephalomyocarditis virus 2235 or influenza B 2236 infection, and the spontaneous 'Reye-like syndrome' in BALB/cByJ mice usually associated with coronavirus infection, have been described. 2237 In another murine model, treatment with 4-pentenoic acid produced a Reye-like syndrome. 2238 ",

Biochemical abnormalities of liver involvement are frequently encountered. 2252 The most common problem results from a hydrops of the gallbladder, which is detectable by ultrasonography, with an incidence ranging from 2.5% to 13.7%, and may be a risk factor for the development of coronary aneurysm. 2253, 2254 Prolonged pain has been attributed to poor emptying of the gallbladder. 2255 The patients have right upper quadrant pain sometimes associated with vomiting.

Cholangitis with bile duct injury and ductular reaction has been observed on liver biopsy in three cases. 2256 Pathological findings at laparotomy include inflammation of the gallbladder, with or without evidence of vasculitis, and occasionally cystic duct obstruction due to inflammatory oedema or lymph node compression.

            "text": "Similarities between Kawasaki disease and leptospirosis have been raised; although the Weil-Felix reaction may be positive, direct tests for leptospirosis are negative. 2261 The close resemblance of fatal cases to infantile periarteritis nodosa has also been emphasized in several studies. 2258, 2262 Affected vessels include the larger coronary arteries and splenic, renal, pulmonary, pancreatic, spermatic, periadrenal, hepatic and mesenteric vessels. Microscopically, the vessels show periarterial inflammation, necrosis and destruction of the media and intimal inflammation. Lesions of varying stages can be observed aneurysms in approximately one-quarter of patients who do not receive IVIG within 10 days of illness. 2241 The diagnostic criteria, formulated by an international panel for a complete diagnosis of Kawasaki disease, include the presence of unexplained fever more than 5 days and four of five main clinical features: (1) changes in extremities such as acute erythema of palms and soles, oedema of hands or feet and subacute periungual peeling of fingers and toes in weeks 2-3; (2) polymorphous exanthema; (3) bilateral bulbal conjunctival injection without exudate; (4) changes in lips and oral cavity: erythema, lips cracking, strawberry tongue, diffuse injection of oral and pharyngeal mucosae; and (5) cervical lymphadenopathy >1.5 cm, usually unilateral. 2242 'Incomplete' Kawasaki disease is defined by two or three of the previous five criteria plus coronary artery disease. GI signs and symptoms include abdominal tenderness, vomiting, diarrhoea, bloody stools and mild jaundice. Hepatobiliary complications comprise hepatosplenomegaly, mild ascites and hydrops of the gallbladder. Jaundice is a rare presentation. 2243 The laboratory data include abnormal ECGs, neutrophil leucocytosis with a shift to the left, thrombocytosis and an increased ESR. Mortality in boys during the first 2 months of the illness is twice the average rate for the disease generally. 2244 Coronary aneurysms and myocarditis occur in 10-20% of patients, with a higher incidence in boys. 2245 Thus Kawasaki disease is a major cause of acquired heart disease in children. Early therapy with high-dose IV \u03b3-globulin and reviewed. 2283 The liver has been reported to be histologically normal in some patients 2286, 2287 or to show nonspecific changes such as an increased glycogen content, 2286,2288 mild fatty change 2288 or haemosiderosis. 2289 Haemosiderosis, both hepatocellular and reticuloendothelial, was also present in the cases reported by Donohue and Uchida 2281 and Ordway and Stout 2290 in combination with other changes. Both these reports described multiple small nodules in the liver that were composed of large, pale, foamy hepatocytes containing much glycogen and a little fat, with occasional fusion of cells and formation of syncytial masses. Ordway and Stout 2290 interpreted these foci as regenerative nodules (Figs 3.169 and 3.170) . Intrahepatic cholestasis has been reported in several cases 2283 and bile ductular reaction in one case. 2290 in different vessels in the same patient and in different areas of the same type of vessel (e.g. coronary arteries), suggesting that the inflammatory process continues over the course of the disease. Aneurysmal dilation of coronary and other vessels (brachial, iliac, renal and pulmonary) may occur. 2258, 2263 Marks et al. 2264 reported the case of a 4-year-old boy with a hepatic artery aneurysm that caused obstructive jaundice.",

A progressive neuropathy, usually noted at about 5 years of age, involves cranial and peripheral nerves. Rarely, adults with a less severe form of the disease have findings consistent with either spinocerebellar degeneration or Parkinsonian disease. Hepatosplenomegaly is common, particularly in the accelerated phase of the disease, 2291 which is heralded by fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, hyperlipidaemia and coagulopathy. Tissue infiltrates consist of benign-appearing histiocytes showing haemophagocytosis, plus lymphocytes and plasma cells which, in the liver, are found in portal areas and sinusoids. 2292 Diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic giant, eosinophilic, peroxidase-positive inclusions in leukocytes that do not degranulate. The disease is autosomal recessive and is caused by a defect in the lysosomal trafficking gene LYST, which is essential for the function of NK cells. 2293 Treatment has included chemotherapeutic agents, particularly during the accelerated phase, but the only cure has been BMT. 2292 ",

In one patient an accessory lobe adherent to the left liver lobe had its own gallbladder. 2326 They are connected to the liver by hepatic tissue or by a mesentery containing branches of the portal vein, hepatic vein and hepatic artery, and a bile duct. 2327 Intrathoracic accessory lobes, with their vascular supply perforating the diaphragm, have been reported. 2328 Accessory lobes may rarely require surgical intervention because of their large size, torsion of a pedicle or the presence of other associated defects. 2329 Pedunculated HCC may arise in accessory lobes. Focal nodular hyperplasia has also been described. 2330 Ectopic hepatic tissue Ectopic hepatic tissue may be found in the suspensory ligaments of the liver, lung, wall of the gallbladder, splenic capsule, retroperitoneal space, adrenal gland and greater omentum. [2331] [2332] [2333] [2334] [2335] [2336] [2337] A unique case of ectopic liver in the placenta was reported by Willis. 2338 In most patients, the hepatic tissue in these ectopic sites is microscopically normal, but when the liver is abnormal (fatty change, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis), the ectopic liver tissue reflects the same changes. 2339, 2340 Infantile haemangioendothelioma arising in an ectopic intrathoracic liver has been reported. 2332 Twenty-three cases of HCC, mostly from Japan, have arisen in ectopic livers. 2340, 2341 Heterotopias Most of the so-called adrenal heterotopias are actually examples of adrenal-hepatic fusion. Dolan and Janovski 2342 made a distinction between 'adhesion' and 'fusion' on the basis of presence or absence of a capsule interposed between the two organs. In both types, there was a marked diminution or complete absence of medullary tissue. The fusion is unilateral and is not associated with clinical evidence of adrenal impairment. It was found in 9.9% of unselected autopsy cases in one study. 2343 The incidence was much higher in older age-groups, suggesting that the condition may be an aging phenomenon. There is a single description of hepatolienal fusion. 2344 Adrenal neoplasms may arise in these adrenal rests (see Chapter 13) .",

The mode of termination is variable; final entry may be into the gallbladder, cystic duct, right or common hepatic duct, junction of the cystic and common hepatic ducts or attributed to a metaplastic process. 2346 Pancreatic acini were found intermingled with peribiliary glandular acini in 4% of autopsy livers, probably representing an intrinsic component of these glands. 2347 Peribiliary glands were shown to be stem cell niches with the ability to differentiate into hepatobiliary and pancreatic cells. Similarities between peribiliary and pancreatic tissue have been proposed to explain shared pathological processes. 2348 Splenic heterotopia presenting as a mass lesion was reported by Lacerda et al. 2349 With one exception, 2350 the rare cases recently reported are examples of splenosis or subcapsular splenic implants following trauma or surgical splenectomy 2351 (see Chapter 15) . Thyroid heterotopia has been occasionally encountered (Fig. 3.174 ) and has been reported in a fetus with trisomy 18 syndrome. 2352",

The proximal part of the fistula resembles a bronchus, whereas the distal part is lined by columnar and/or squamous epithelium.

It occurs more frequently in men and is most often in the medial segment of the left hepatic lobe. In one case the cyst appeared closely associated with the left hepatic vein. 2378 In most instances the cyst is unilocular (Fig. 3.175) . The mean cyst diameter is approximately 3 cm. One large cyst was associated with an elevated serum CA19-9 level. 2379 There have been a few isolated reports of squamous cell carcinoma arising in a ciliated foregut cyst (see Chapter 13) . 2380, 2381 Histologically, the cyst wall consists of four layers: pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with mucous cells, subepithelial connective tissue, bundles of smooth muscle and an outermost fibrous capsule [2382] [2383] [2384] [2385] (Fig. 3.176 ). Endocrine cells are present in the cyst B A epithelium. 2385 Gastric metaplasia has also been described. 2377 In all seven cases of Chatelain et al., 2385 immunoreactivity of some cells for CD10 suggested the presence of Clara cells.

In patients without other bile duct structural lesions, the aetiology is unknown, although congenital weakness of the bile duct walls, mucous plugs and gallstones have been suggested. 142, 143, 2386 The clinical presentation consists of conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, ascites, failure to thrive and signs of peritoneal irritation. Sepsis can complicate the clinical picture. 2387 The diagnosis can be suspected by finding bile on abdominal paracentesis and confirmed by hepatobiliary scanning with a technetium-99m-labelled iminodiacetic acid derivative. 2386 Treatment is surgical and the prognosis excellent. Pathological descriptions of the liver are usually consistent with obstruction: ductular reaction and oedematous portal tracts.",
