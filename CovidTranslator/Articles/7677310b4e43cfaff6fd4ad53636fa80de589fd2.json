However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread.",

We 127 collected the actual passenger data for top 10 visiting cities leaving from Wuhan Tianhe International Airport 128 before the lockdown of Wuhan city from 30 December to 20 January, 2020. Note that we did not have data for 129 railroad and other forms of transport, and thus made an assumption that the total number of travelers is 4 times 130 higher than that of air transport except for certain cities on Hainan island that have no road connections to 131 Wuhan. We made this assumption because that the number of train passengers is few times higher than that of 132 airline in China [15] and the results from a population migration database suggested a similar ratio [16] . The 133 number of daily passengers between different cities were used to generate the mobility rate M ji between 134 locations i and j. For example, we divided a daily passenger number by total population size in Wuhan to 135 represent the contact rate between Wuhan city and any other connected city j. We denote i = 0 as the index for 136 the source city. Therefore, M 00 = 1 is the base level of contact rate within the source city. j is a number to 137 represent the index of the top visiting cities from first to last following the order in the list. Because the 138 estimated number of people leaving from Wuhan to the first visiting city (Beijing) is 10793.5 per day, given that 139 the population size of Wuhan is about 11 million, the daily percentage of people leaving to the 1st visiting city 140 can be approximated to 0.001. Thus, we have M 10 = 0.001. We used the same approach to determine M j0 for 141 j = 2, 3, . . . , 10.",

Because most of the imported cases 284 can be detected more easily under 14 days quarantine from the passengers coming from the epidemic source 285 region, thus the risk of outbreak is not primarily linked to the number of the imported cases. However, 286 secondary cases, without travel history to the epidemic source region, are more difficult to be identified or 287 quarantined before disease onset and thus are more easily to become undetected cases in a community. infectious disease control [30] . A recent study has used a modeling approach to forecast the dynamics of 292 outbreak spreading [27] .

The results suggest that if the epidemic growth at the source location is high, even 298 a near full-scale border control without proper quarantine measure, will have only limited effects.

Outbreak spreads in Mainland China were reconstructed and compared with different transmissibilities and 177 latent periods. We first calculated the cumulative number of secondary infected cases produced by imported 178 cases among top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan under a scenario corresponding to an R 0 of 2.92 [18], a 179 generation time of 8.4 days [19], and an incubation time (for defining latent period) of 5.2 days for the outbreak 180 in Wuhan city.

The cumulative number of secondary infected 182individuals generated by the imported cases moving from Wuhan was calculated (Figure 3A). A threshold 183 number of cases \u03bd = 8 was used to indicate a higher than 50% probability of community spread will occur if 184 the cumulative number of secondary cases is over that threshold.185 186The arrival times of outbreak emergence (defined as the time to reach above this threshold) for the top 10 cities 187were between 16 -20 days (Figure 3A), with the average arrival time 18 days (corresponding to 18 January).188On day 28, the secondary cases rise to 139 persons for the top city Beijing, which makes the total number of 189 secondary cases among all the top ten visiting cities to 915.7 persons.

Then the extra arrival gain times of outbreak emergence comparing to a baseline setting using251    Beijing city were calculated.252 253 Under a low R 0 (1.4), the border control measure that reduced 90% of the passenger numbers gained extra 32.5 254 days of outbreak arrival time (Figure 6A).

However, under the high R 0 (2.92), 256 the effect on reducing the chance of outbreak emergence was very low, with only 10 extra days obtained. 257 258 Next, we calculated gain time by time to quarantine under different R 0 settings. Under the low R 0 (1.4), if the 259 individual was quarantined immediately (happened in one day after the person became infectious), the gain 260 time became as large as 44.0 days (Figure 6B).

The effects of border control on gain time under a low R 0 (1.4), mild R 0 (1.68), high R 0 (2.92) were plotted using the same color codes as A.
