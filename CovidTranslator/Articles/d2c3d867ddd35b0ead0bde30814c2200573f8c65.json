The mean positive predictive value was 99.3 % (range 93.4-100 %) and the mean negative predictive value was 95.3 % (range 98.4-100 %). Feasibility and clinical value of the 19-valent method was prospectively shown on 16,231 incoming clinical specimens from patients between 0 and 16 years of age with acute respiratory tract infections admitted to pediatric hospitals or private practices from October 2003 to June 2010 in three regions in Germany (Kiel, Mainz, Freiburg; Freiburg to June 2007 only). At least one microorganism was detected in 10,765 of 16,231 (66.3 %) clinical specimens: 5,044 RV, 1,999 RSV, 1,286 AV, 944 EV, 737 seasonal IVA, 173 pandemic IVA H1N1 -2009, 899 MPV, 518 CV, 383 PIV3, 268 PIV1, 259 Mpn, 205 IVB, 164 PIV2, 144 PIV4, 103 Bp, 29 Cpn and 29 Bpp, while reovirus and Lpn were not present in these specimens from a pediatric population. More than one organism could be detected in 13.4 % of the specimens. Conclusions The m-RT-PCR-ELISA evaluated here improves the spectrum for diagnosing respiratory infections and is a feasible instrument for individual diagnostic and epidemiological studies.

While some important causes like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are commensals of the upper respiratory tract, other viral and bacterial agents are considered to be regular pathogens and their detection from a clinical specimen is considered as proof of infection. These include enterovirus (EV), influenza virus type A (IVA) and type B (IVB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV1), type 2 (PIV2), type 3 (PIV3), and type 4 (PIV4), adenovirus (AV), rhinovirus (RV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), coronavirus (CV), reovirus (RV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mpn), Chlamydophila pneumoniae (Cpn), Bordetella pertussis (Bp), Bordetella parapertussis (Bpp), and Legionella pneumophila (Lpn). For these, molecular amplification techniques are advantageous as compared to culture techniques, because the results are available earlier, lower cost, and higher sensitivity. Moreover, the diagnostic laboratory handling of viable pathogens is not required.",

(iii) Clinical specimens from frozen stocks (-80\u00b0C) which had been collected between 1995 and 2004 at the Institute of Virology, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were tested by m-RT-PCR techniques versus culture for sensitivity and specificity (here called the ''retrospective test''). Clinical specimens from Kiel were not stored in virus medium, and, thus, their use in virus culture was known to result in a reduced sensitivity [3] . To avoid this bias, in the retrospective testing, only clinical specimens from the Department of Virology, Rotterdam, stored in virus medium (calf serum) at -80\u00b0C were used. The specimens used for this part of the evaluation (n = 430) were nasopharyngeal aspirates, swabs, or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The gold standard was defined as the result of culture, a secondary RT-PCR in an external laboratory, or from sequence information derived on organisms detected with one of the methods within a specimen, especially for differentiation within the picornavirus group (EV and RV).",

The RT and PCR were performed on a BioRad iCycler (BioRad Laboratories GmbH, Munich, Germany) or a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 9600 Thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer, Branchburg, NJ, USA). For the PCR, the AccuPrime TM Taq DNA Polymerase System (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used. The PCR was performed in parallel in two tubes containing Primer Mix A and Mix B, respectively. Primers and concentrations used in the mix are given in Table 1 and the sequences are shown in Table 2 . The setup of PCR mixtures for 15 reactions was performed on ice as follows. Mix A: 394 ll nuclease-free water (Promega GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), 68 ll PCR buffer I (Accu-Prime System, Invitrogen), 27 ll Primer Mix A, 13.6 ll AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen), and 6.8 ll of digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche Diagnostics, Germany), and for Mix B 2/3 of the volumes: 263 ll nuclease-free water, 45 ll PCR buffer I, 18 ll Primer Mix B, 9.1 ll AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen), and 4.5 ll of digoxigenin-11-dUTP. 20 ll of this Mix B were transferred to 14 new PCR tubes each and 6 ll of the c-DNA from the 15-ll RT reaction were added as the PCR template. 30 ll of Mix A were added to the remaining (9 ll) c-DNA from each RT tube. The protocol for the PCR was: 2 min activation at 94\u00b0C and, afterwards, 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 20 s, 72\u00b0C for 40 s, followed by one final extension for 10 min at 72\u00b0C and a cooling step to 4\u00b0C. The ramping times were adjusted as follows: 36 s for heating from 55 to 94\u00b0C, 25 s for cooling from 94 to 55\u00b0C, and 31 s for heating from 55 to 72\u00b0C. The performance of this m-RT-PCR is optimal using the Accu-Prime System (Invitrogen) and other enzymes or a different thermocycler may need adaptation. Especially, the ramping times of thermocyclers may be different and should be controlled.",

Likewise, the two capture probes for reovirus and coronavirus OC43 were each combined in one hybridization mix. The optical density was measured at OD 405 , with a reference at OD 490 . The run was considered to be valid if all negative control values were \\0.2 OD units at OD 405 . The classification of results was performed as previously described [3] . The complete m-RT-PCR-ELISA procedure was guided by Excel-based software, which calculates the volumes for RT-PCR and gives a pipetting pattern for the ELISA microwell plates, as well as classification of the ELISA results as described above.

Sequencing of PCR fragments was performed by the sequencing service of Qiagen (Hilden, Germany).

Comparison of the single primer test with the multiplex approach showed a higher sensitivity for the detection of Cpn and PIV1 in the single primer test and the same sensitivity for the other pathogens. By using a 40-cycle PCR protocol, the sensitivity could be increased (see Table 4 Table 5 . The sensitivity on clinical specimens from Rotterdam was between 83.3 % for CV and MPV up to 100 % for the picornaviruses (EV/RV), IVA, and PIV4. The specificity of the m-RT-PCR-ELISA was over 99 % for most of the organisms. The five RV which were only positive in the m-RT-PCR-ELISA were not tested by sequencing and two of them were from the first set of specimens from Rotterdam which were not tested for RV by culture.

Furthermore, the tests on different types of adenoviruses revealed that all 49 tested types could be detected. Sequence alignments with the primers and probes used for, e.g., enterovirus, influenza viruses, and others, revealed that these were capable of detecting many more types of human pathogens within these groups. The primers used for influenza as described in Table 2 are not able to detect the avian H5N1 virus. For this, a separate primer pair and probe were used. In case of a human H5N1 infection, it is important to test for this pathogen directly by single primer PCR, prompted by the history of exposure.",

Since the single primer RT-PCR ELISA showed a tenfold higher sensitivity for PIV1 as compared to the multiplex approach, one must assume that the reduced sensitivity is based on the use in the multiplex approach rather than on the design of primers itself. As discussed earlier [3] , the PIV3 F-gene primers originally used in the 9-valent m-RT-PCR were changed to the hemagglutininneuraminidase gene primers as described by Echevarr\u00eda et al. [35] , because the F-gene primers failed to detect all PIV3 in clinical specimens. The extended m-RT-PCR uses the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene as target sequences for PIV1 and PIV3, and the latter gave comparable results in analytical sensitivity to culture. For PIV1 and also for Cpn, the single primer detection was more sensitive by a factor of ten.",

However, this may result in some weak unspecific fragments on agarose gel in the multiplex approach, especially on viscous and/or mucous specimens. Therefore, multiplex method was performed with 35 cycles and to confirm specimens with questionable results in ELISA or weak fragments on agarose gel by single primer RT-PCR with 40 cycles, which was more sensitive in 80 % of the 35 cycle/40 cycle comparison tested.",

Why this is consistent with other studies in children with acute respiratory tract infections [36, 37] , it raises the question as to what extent the presence of RV represents carriage, incubation, or convalescence is unknown [36] . Even the detection of a virus from the lower respiratory tract is no proof for its disease-causing abilities. Nevertheless, the high frequency at which RV was identified from nasopharyngeal specimens of infants and young children admitted to our hospitals with ARI suggests a causative correlation of the agent and the observed ARI symptoms. More definite support for considering RV as a ''true ARI pathogen'' comes from the fact that in situ hybridization has demonstrated that RV may trigger inflammatory processes in infected cells and tissues [37] . Future studies will have to show if specific microorganisms which, to date, are considered to be ''true pathogens'', may, in fact, colonize certain populations under specific circumstances.",

Simultaneous detections have also been observed by others using molecular techniques in a multiplex format [4, 7, [38] [39] [40] [41] . However, the results of simultaneous detections have to be judged with care, because m-RT-PCR, like other ''non-quantitative'' PCR-based techniques, only detect fragments of nucleic acids. Thus, a positive PCR result only allows the conclusion that a specific part of the genome of a pathogen was present. It is not possible to draw conclusions about the viability of the respective pathogens. Quantitative PCR assays have the advantage of calculating the amount of pathogens present in specimens (only roughly for respiratory specimens) and may give additional guidance to judge whether the pathogen is, in fact, responsible for the infection. In specimens, e.g., from the lower respiratory tract, which may contain encapsulated material, it is possible that non-viable pathogens from earlier infections are present. Also, some pathogens, such as adenoviruses, may persist in the airways for a long time without causing disease.",
