Both systems detected between 40 to 50% more viruses than traditional methods, primarily rhinoviruses and human metapneumovirus. The FilmArray RP detected significantly more total viruses either alone or as part of mixed infections than the xTAG RVP, as well as an additional 21.6% more respiratory syncytial viruses. The xTAG RVP requires 5 to 6 h with 2.5 to 3 h of hands-on time, while the FilmArray RP takes about an hour with 3 to 5 min of hands-on time, making it much easier to perform.",

            "text": "Multiplex reverse transcriptase respiratory virus PCR has been shown to be more sensitive than standard respiratory virus culture, direct fluorescent-antigen, and direct enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigen detection methods (1, 2, 7-9, 13-14, 16, 20) . Viral culture is labor-intensive, detects some viruses (e.g., rhinovirus and coronavirus) poorly, and requires 3 to 5 days to detect most agents. Consequently, results are generally not available early in the clinical decisionmaking process. Direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) and chromatographic immunoassays are rapid enough to support real-time clinical decisions, but DFA is highly labor-intensive and chromatographic immunoassays are relatively insensitive. The FilmArray RP multiplex respiratory virus panel uses a pouch system that contains all reagents for the identification of 18 respiratory viruses and 3 bacterial respiratory pathogens in about 1 h after inoculation of a patient sample, obviating both labor and turnaround time (TAT) issues. We compared the performance of the FilmArray RP with that of the FDAcleared Luminex xTAG RVP multiplex panel by using 200 retrospective clinical respiratory virus culture samples. . Both assays include internal controls for amplification and extraction and were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, following training by the respective companies. The FilmArray RP pouch contains dried reagents for all the steps needed for extraction, PCR amplification, and detection of the respiratory viruses listed above. As shown in Fig. 1 , the pouch is rehydrated under negative pressure with 1 ml molecular reagent-grade water in the reagent port. Two hundred fifty microliters of sample is diluted into 0.5 ml sample buffer, of which 300 l is injected into the sample port. The pouch is then placed in the FilmArray RP instrument and identified by bar code, and the assay is started. Results are available in about an hour. For the xTAG RVP, nucleic acid extraction with the addition of an extraction control was done with a Roche MagNA Pure compact instrument using a 200-l sample eluted in 50 l, of which 5 l was used for the assay. The remaining extracted nucleic acid and aliquots of the original frozen specimen were stored at \u03ea70\u00b0C for further testing. The xTAG is currently FDA cleared only for nasopharyngeal swabs and extraction with the bioM\u00e9rieux EasyMag, the bioM\u00e9rieux MiniMag, and the Qiagen QIAamp MiniElute.",

With 8 samples, there was no agreement between the FilmArray RP and the xTAG RVP. The FilmArray RP was positive and the xTAG RVP was negative for 1 or more agents in 6 cases, while the xTAG RVP was positive with a negative FilmArray RP in 2 instances. Nine samples had multiple viruses, in which the FilmArray RP detected a total of 8 additional viruses, while the xTAG RVP detected 2 not found by the FilmArray RP. The FilmArray RP detected 8 RSVs while the corresponding xTAG RVP was negative (n \u03ed 4), or it was negative for RSV when one or more other viruses were detected by the xTAG RVP (P \u03ed 0.007813 by McNemar's test). Detection of RSV by the FilmArray RP but not the xTAG RVP suggests either that the FilmArray RP is more sensitive or that there could be sequence differences that are picked up in one method but not the other. In the former case, one would expect quantitation to show low titers on average, while in the latter, the quantity of virus should match that of the overall population. For this reason, we compared the semiquantitative cycle threshold (C T ) available from the FilmArray RP with the MFI of the xTAG RVP for the RSV-positive specimens (Fig. 2) . The FilmArray RP RSV-positive/xTAG RVP-negative specimens cluster in the high C T range, suggesting that the discrepancy in RSV detection in most samples may have been due to low levels of virus.",

Pabbaraju et al. (17) also noted a greater number of positive RSV results using an in-house PCR than found by the xTAG RVP (92 versus 78, in 9 of which RSV was a single positive result). Although the experiments were not definitive, most of the discordant RSVs in our study had low titers in the FilmArray RP, suggesting a higher sensitivity in the FilmArray RP rather than lack of amplification due to RSV sequence differences detected by the FilmArray RP but not by the xTAG RVP. Were the latter the case, one would expect the distribution of C T s in the FilmArray RP to be similar to that of the entire group, which they clearly are not (Fig. 2) . Pabbaraju et al.

We did not have clinical information to look into whether mixed infections were of greater severity than single infections as has been reported by others (3, 4, 18, 19, 21) . The xTAG RVP does not report quantitative results, but \"mean fluorescence intensity\" (MFI) is available. The research version of the FilmArray RP has a cycle threshold (C T ), although this number only indirectly measures the initial amount of virus present and is not planned for the clinical product. However, as shown in Fig. 2 for RSV, the xTAG RVP MFI and the FilmArray RP C T do show a general correlation, but the range is somewhat less than in typical single real-time PCR assays. RSV titers in infants have been reported to be high on admission and to fall approximately 2 log 10 units over a 7-to 8-day hospitalization (5) as symptoms improve. This pattern was also observed for infection with human rhinovirus (HRV) as a single agent, but when either RSV or HRV was found in low titer on admission as part of a dual infection, its titer tended to remain unchanged over the course of hospitalization, while that of the higher-titer coinfecting virus fell as it did with single-virus infections (6) . It will be important for future studies to define the natural course of viral titers in both single and multiple viral infections when antiviral treatment is given. In view of the extensive clinical experience with the responses of HIV and HCV viral loads to antiviral treatment, it is likely that clinicians will want to apply this paradigm to the treatment of respiratory viral disease.",

            "text": "The xTAG RVP requires 5 to 6 h to complete, including separate reverse transcriptase, PCR, and linking steps to attach the PCR product to the Luminex beads before the results can be read. Logistically, the process takes an entire workday or has to be split into 2 half-day sessions. The test also requires approximately 2.5 to 3 h of actual hands-on time, as well as meticulous technique to prevent cross contamination in the open system. We found it necessary to aliquot reconstituted reagents and store them at \u03ea70\u00b0C between runs to maintain reagent quality and reliability. In contrast, the FilmArray RP requires 3 to 5 min of hands-on time to inoculate the pouch, read a bar code, and load the instrument. Results are available in about an hour, but only one test at a time can be run as the system is presently configured. The list price for the FilmArray RP is $129/test, but this includes essentially everything necessary to perform the assay. The xTAG RVP lists for $120/test, but the extraction kits and positive-control material have to be purchased separately. The ease of use (literally 3 to 5 min of hands-on time) and rapid turnaround time (TAT) were remarkable features of the FilmArray RP. However, since only one sample can be processed at a time, in its current format, the FilmArray RP may be suitable for low-to moderate-volume laboratories but would have only an adjunctive role in high-volume laboratories.

Sixty-one percent were from patients \u03fd18 years old. The study was approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board. Viral culture and antigen detection. One hundred eighty specimens were cultured using standard tube cultures and shell vials containing human diploid fibroblasts, monkey kidney cells, and A 549 cells (Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH, and ViroMed Laboratories, Minnetonka, MN) at 33\u00b0C. Shell vials were stained on days 3 and 5 for influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, and adenovirus using the Light Diagnostics (Temecula, CA) 7-way fluorescent-antibody screen and further identified with specific antisera if positive. Five samples (three influenza A virus and two RSV) were tested by direct antigen testing only (BinaxNOW; Binax, Inc., Scarborough, ME). Fifteen samples were tested by multiplex PCR only. Multiplex respiratory virus PCR. The FilmArray RP detects the following agents: influenza A virus, influenza A virus subtype H1, influenza A virus subtype H3, influenza A virus subtype H1N1 swine-origin variant, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus OC43, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus HKU1, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1, parainfluenza virus 2, parainfluenza virus 3, parainfluenza virus 4, bocavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. The xTAG RVP detects influenza A virus, influenza A virus subtype H1, influenza A virus subtype H3, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza 1 virus, parainfluenza 2 virus, parainfluenza 3 virus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus",
