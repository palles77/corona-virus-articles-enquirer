            "text": "We report the development of a new technology for simultaneous quantitative detection of multiple targets in a single sample. Scalable transcriptional analysis routine (STAR) represents a novel integration of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis that allows detection of dozens of gene transcripts in a multiplexed format using amplicon size as an identifier for each target. STAR demonstrated similar or better sensitivity and precision compared to two commonly used methods, SYBR Green-based and TaqMan probe-based real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. STAR can be used as a flexible platform for building a variety of applications to monitor gene expression, from single gene assays to assays analyzing the expression level of multiple genes. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus as a model system , STAR technology detected single copies of the viral genome in a two-gene multiplex. Blinded studies using RNA extracted from various tissues of a SARSinfected individual showed that STAR correctly identified all samples containing SARS virus and yielded negative results for non-SARS control samples. Using alternate priming strategies , STAR technology can be adapted to transcriptional profiling studies without requiring a priori sequence information. Thus , STAR technology offers a flexible platform for development of highly multiplexed assays in gene expression analysis and molecular diagnostics. Nucleic acid testing of clinical samples and tissues is increasingly widespread and applied to various areas of medicine and diagnostics including pathogen identification, 1 blood bank testing, 2 cancer recurrence, 3 and prediction of clinical outcome. 4 The competitive landscape of available technologies is characterized by clear sep-aration of very sensitive and quantitative methods measuring single bioanalytes [real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), transcription mediated amplification, ligase chain reaction, rolling circle amplification, and so forth] and methods capable of multiplexing thousands of genes (DNA microarrays, serial analysis of gene expression, differential display, and so forth) with less sensitivity and quantitative ability compared to single gene methods. The recent introduction of technologies capable of analyzing a number of analytes or biomarkers in a highthroughput multiplex configuration in clinical diagnostics 5, 6 and gene expression analysis (HT Genomics, www.htgenomics.com) demonstrates a growing trend toward development of multiplex assays. The future of nucleic acid testing requires better multiplexing abilities that maintain or exceed the current levels of sensitivity.",

            "text": "Although real-time PCR is the most common method using optical detection, others such as transcription-mediated amplification, ligase chain reaction, and strand displacement amplification are also widely used and marketed for nucleic acid testing diagnostics. 7, 8 Many of these techniques depend on the detection and quantification of fluorescent molecules whose signal increases in proportion to the amount of amplified nucleic acid generated. Yet multiplexing capabilities for these methods are limited due to the overlapping absorption and emission spectra of available fluorophores thus restricting the number of multiplexed targets to four or five. 9, 10 At the opposite extreme, several methods have been developed that have excellent multiplexing capabilities allowing the analysis of large amounts of genomic information. The most widely used method depends on DNA microarrays, a technique that detects expression of up to thousands of genes based on optical detection of hybridized fluorescently labeled DNA probes combined with spatial positioning. [11] [12] [13] Serial analysis of gene expression 14 and differential display 15 also allow the transcriptome of two samples to be compared with the added advantage that a priori sequence knowledge is not required. Despite this, each of these techniques has sev-eral drawbacks. They lack sensitivity, show poor quantification capabilities, and require large amounts of biological material. 16 Finally, each is a long multistep process that requires a high level of technical expertise that can contribute to variability in data obtained.",

Specificity of PCR amplification is due to appropriate primer choice and reaction conditions. Because CE allows accurate size determination of fluorescently labeled nucleic acids from 50 to 1000 bases with single base precision, assays can be conducted simultaneously for dozens of targets whose identities are defined by the specific size of its corresponding amplicons, while maintaining quantification capabilities equal to or better than those observed with established real-time PCR methods. Although initial proof-of-concept experiments were performed manually, in the course of this work, we automated aliquot dispensing during PCR amplification, and are currently working on integration of a fully automated system that will integrate aliquot dispensing with CE separation. STAR is fast, cost-effective, and has a large dynamic range. Here we present STAR technology and its application to diagnostics and gene expression analysis.",

PCR primers are designed for each target so that the amplicon length serves as a unique identifier for each particular target. Each amplicon must vary by at least 5 nucleotides in size. Aliquots of the multiplex PCR reaction are removed after successive PCR cycles and separated by CE. Amplification curves are reconstructed based on the area under each amplified target. As for conventional real-time PCR, cycle thresholds (C T ) can be determined from the graphs thereby allowing the determination of initial copy number for each amplified template. For applications that quantify RNA levels, STAR can be modified to a one-step reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR reaction (see below).",

            "text": "STAR technology is a further extension of multiplex realtime PCR that allows a much greater degree of multiplexing compared to existing technologies. STAR benefits from the integration of PCR and CE in which specificity of PCR amplification is due to appropriate primer choice and reaction conditions, and CE allows resolution of DNA fragments that differ by a few bases. The multiplexing power of STAR is a result of using amplicon size as a unique identifier for particular genes or biomarkers instead of fluorescent color or melting temperature used in other methods. In STAR experiments, a multiplex PCR reaction is sampled after each PCR cycle and subsequently separated by CE. The area under peaks corre-sponding to specific PCR products are quantified and plotted as a function of cycle number to generate amplification plots, which can be analyzed using current algorithms of real-time PCR analysis ( Figure 1 ; see Materials and Methods for a complete description). Currently, Taq-Man probe-based (TaqMan) and SYBR Green-based (SYBR) real-time RT-PCR are the methods of choice for detection and quantification of transcripts. We compared detection of three genes (arc, homer1a, and zif268) in a complex background using TaqMan, SYBR, and STAR, individually or as a three-gene multiplex. Twofold serially diluted samples of total brain RNA were used as sample templates. To allow direct comparison between protocols, the PCR primer sequences used for each assay were identical with the exceptions that TaqMan hydrolysis probe was added for TaqMan assays and the forward PCR primers were fluorescently labeled for STAR assays. Amplification efficiencies and amplification curves observed for STAR are similar to that of TaqMan and SYBR for all three genes examined, but with higher sensitivity ( Figure 2 , Table 2 ). Cycle thresholds are six and four cycles sooner for STAR protocols than for TaqMan or SYBR protocols, respectively, representing a 64-fold increase in STAR detection limits as compared to TaqMan or SYBR.",

We do, however, find that the cycle threshold is often lower in multiplexed samples than samples amplified individually. This is likely due to more efficient or promiscuous priming during reverse transcription resulting from the increased number of primers present in multiplex reactions that can anneal to RNA templates at low reaction temperatures (42\u00b0C; Figure 2 ).",

The sequence tags act as identifiers for the sample source. Resultant cDNAs are pooled and PCR amplified using a simplified primer set: reverse primers ST1 and ST2, each labeled with a different fluorophore thereby allowing the sample source to be identified by specific color, and a gene-specific primer for each target effectively reducing the number of required PCR primers in half (n sequences require n \u03e9 2 PCR primers).

STAR is sensitive and reproducible. A: Artificial transcripts were 10-fold serially diluted from 3,000,000 to 3 copies in E. coli tRNA (20 g/ml) and amplified as a three-gene multiplex STAR assay using (FAM)L-HA and (FAM)pcDNA3L primers. C T versus copy number plots are shown for VS31 (diamonds), VS32 (squares), and VS85 (triangles). Insufficient data points were obtained for VS31 and VS85 to allow C T calculation at three copies. R 2 values were greater than 0.99. Amplification efficiency \u03ed 10 (\u03ea1/slope) \u03ea 1. B: To demonstrate reproducibility, four samples, each containing 300 copies of artificial transcripts VS31, VS32, and VS85 in a background of E. coli tRNA (20 g/ml), were multiplex amplified as above. Amplification curves for VS32 are represented by open circles, squares, triangles, and diamonds. Samples are separately reverse transcribed using primers that contain a sample-specific sequence tag (ST1 or ST2) fused to poly(T) n -VN that anchors the primer to the 5\u0408-end of the poly(A) tail. Samples are then mixed followed by second strand synthesis reaction using forward primers that combine a second sequence tag (UT2) fused to a short arbitrary nucleotide sequence (hexamer or octamer) that can prime at many loci. Based on random occurrence, hexamers should occur every 4096 bases and octamers every 65,536 bases. However, the frequency of hexamers in human expressed genome is not random and shows considerable bias (V. Cheung, personal communication). By selecting arbitrary sequences with care, a series of second strand primers can be developed that result in amplification of hundreds to thousands of cDNAs per reaction based on the current expressed sequence tag database. We estimate that 95% of the expressed genome can be covered with 20 second strand primers coupled to hexamers. Samples are then PCR amplified using reverse primers FAM- Figure 5 . Alternative priming strategy using two sequence tags. A: Schematic representation depicting the incorporation of two sequence tags during RT-PCR. Incorporation of sample-specific sequence tags during RT is followed by incorporation of a second sequence tag during second strand synthesis. PCR then proceeds using three primers, each of the sample-specific reverse sequence tags fluorescently labeled, and the common forward sequence tag. Aliquots are collected, separated, and analyzed by CE followed by analysis of relevant fragments. B: Total rat brain RNA samples (1.75 g) spiked with 100 pg of VS31 (top) or unspiked (bottom) were separately reverse transcribed using sample-specific sequence tags (ST1-dT14-VN and ST2-dT14-VN) followed by RNA hydrolysis, purification, and sample mixing. Second strand synthesis was performed using UT2-HA followed by purification. Fragments were then amplified using FAM-ST1, ROX-ST2, and UT2. Aliquots were collected, separated by CE, and analyzed to generate the electropherograms shown. C: Total rat brain RNA (1.75 g) was processed by STAR as described in B except that for PCR amplification NED-ST2 replaced ROX-ST2 (top panel) and VIC-ST2 replaced ROX-ST2 (bottom). D: Comparison of signal generated from 50 and 75 pg of input transcript. Two analytes were prepared in a background of 1.75 g of total rat brain RNA. Analyte 1 was spiked with 50 pg of VS31 and 50 pg of VS85. Analyte 2 was spiked with 50 pg of VS31 and 75 pg of VS85. Each analyte was reverse transcribed separately using sample-specific sequence ST1dT14-VN or ST2dT14-VN generating cDNAs that were sequence tagged with either ST1 (analyte 1) or ST2 (analyte 2). Resulting cDNAs from both analytes were pooled and purified. Second strand was then synthesized using a forward sequence tag, UT2-HA. Again, excess primer was removed. Multiplex real-time PCR was performed using three primers, UT2, ROX-labeled ST1, and FAM-labeled ST2. Aliquots were taken from cycles 20 to 43 and analyzed by CE.",

This method combines the quantitative capacity of real-time PCR with the vast separating power of CE allowing simultaneous measurement of dozens of DNA or RNA targets in a single reaction. Integration of PCR and CE for multiplexed assays was originally suggested as end-point PCR amplification followed by analysis and quantification of the amplified targets by CE in which each target DNA was identified based on amplicon length. 26 This approach was successfully applied to gene expression analysis 22, 27 and diagnostic applications 28 -31 using end-point PCR detection. However, realtime PCR is preferred to endpoint PCR due to better precision and broader dynamic range of quantitative measurements. 32 Li and colleagues 33 furthered the technology demonstrating that parallel single gene PCR reactions terminated after successive cycles and analyzed by CE results in amplification curves for real-time analysis of a single target. STAR technology extends this concept to enable real-time PCR algorithms for quantification of multiple targets within a single reaction. Rather than setting up separate PCR reactions for each aliquot, STAR monitors PCR amplification by withdrawing an aliquot from the same reaction tube after each successive cycle. This arrangement decreases the total volume required for PCR, avoids variability caused by nonuniform thermocycling across PCR plates, and permits simpler design of an analytical instrument (for example by using direct electrokinetic transfer from PCR tube to the capillary).",

We find that PCR efficiencies observed for each of the methods are within the range of experimental error ( Table 2) and are likely to reflect the different fluorescent labeling methods used. We have previously found that amplification efficiencies can be differentially affected by covalent modifications of primers (data not shown). TaqMan assays can also show variable PCR efficiencies based on nucleotide composition, hybridization kinetics, and probe positioning. 34 This result is in good agreement with other multiplex real-time PCR methods in which efficiency of multiplex PCR could be optimized to the level of single gene amplification. 35 We also observed consistently lower threshold cycles for STAR assays than for TaqMan and SYBR assays. This observation can be partly explained by differences in the detection methods used (laser-induced fluorescence reading using ABI 3100 Prism instrument, versus chargecoupled device camera readings on the Bio-Rad ICycler real-time PCR system). However, there is a fundamental difference in the sensitivity of STAR and other optical real-time PCR methods due to reaction mechanisms. STAR directly measures fluorescence of the PCR product, whereas TaqMan and SYBR assess a secondary reaction that relies on an interaction between the PCR product and a signal-generating probe or dye, respectively. It is therefore not unexpected that methods based on the detection of primary PCR products are more sensitive than methods based on secondary signal-generating probe or dye intercalation.",

For targets that show high sequence variability such as HIV-1, 36 a broader scope of options for primer design is available. Second, because detection does not require probe hydrolysis, all restrictions related to the probe design (probe length and composition, distance to PCR primers) do not influence primer selection. Third, STAR technology has the potential to analyze hundreds of targets per reaction due to discrimination of DNA fragments both by size and fluorophore color. Current real-time PCR methods are limited to four targets per reaction. Finally, as specific PCR products are well separated from potential nonspecific PCR products (for example, primer-dimers), primer design criteria for STAR protocols can be relaxed.",

To our knowledge, these are the first examples of real-time PCR of more than 10 genes simultaneously. Importantly, development of this assay required no primer optimization because the first set selected by commonly used primer design software was successfully implemented. Moreover, multiplexing with STAR is only limited by the separation power of CE, which can separate hundreds of DNA fragments differing by a single nucleotide in size. However, expanding STAR multiplex assays to include dozens to hundreds of targets using gene-specific primers can result in severe background due to primer interactions and nonspecific amplification. The alternate priming strategies outlined that result in incorporation of sequence tags dramatically simplifies the PCR reaction by reducing the number of primers required, thereby decreasing background amplification.",

Using sequence tags and random hexamers as outlined in Figure 5 , we have observed simultaneous real-time amplification of \u03f3150 different DNA fragments using STAR for direct transcriptional profiling ( Figure 5 , B and C) and have found that the patterns obtained from total rat brain RNA are reproducible (data not shown). Zhong and Yeung 37 have similarly found that tissue-specific patterns of cDNAs are generated when RNA is reverse transcribed using random hexamers. We anticipate that a genetic fingerprint can be defined for various tissues for each second strand primer used. Each fragment can be predicted from available genomic sequence data or identified by sequencing to define the expressed transcriptome for each of the tissues. Because the real-time quantitative algorithm used in STAR provides better quantification of small differences as well as a much broader dynamic range allowing broadly expressed transcripts to be analyzed, this database could serve as a diagnostic tool because the presence/absence and expression level of each fragment would be known. Novel amplicons may represent overexpressed genes, products of gene fusion, or trans-splicing, alternatively spliced genes, or genes derived from pathogens. The use of multiple fluorophores also allows comparison of at least two samples during transcriptional profiling suggesting that STAR would be comparable to microarrays with the added advantage of identifying new genetic transcripts.",

In addition to the obvious consideration of cost, multiplexed assays require less sample material to be withdrawn from patients, and much simpler logistics regarding laboratory tests. As a first step in the development of multiplexed diagnostic assays based on STAR technology we designed an assay for quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV. This assay was developed as a one-step RT-PCR to detect and quantify SARS-CoV RNA throughout a broad concentration, ranging from several viral copies up to several hundred thousand viral copies per reaction. In a blinded study, our assay correctly identified both SARS-CoV target sequences from tissue samples obtained from a SARS-infected individual with titers ranging from 39,900 to 162 viral copies per reaction without showing any false-positives. The STAR assay for SARS-CoV detection used simultaneous amplification of several target sequences from the SARS-CoV genome to confirm specificity of the assay especially in the context of complex clinical samples. This assay serves as a prototype for diagnostic tests in which a single clinical sample can be assessed for the presence of several pathogens. Alternatively, targeting several regions of the pathogen genome may be necessary for detection of rapidly mutating organisms because use of a single pair of specific primers may lead to false-negatives due to mutation of that site. This could be particularly important in the case when mutations are associated with virulence or drug resistance. 38 STAR technology could be used for many immediate applications, most of which require multiplexing in the range of several dozen genes rather than hundreds. Such applications may include quantitative analysis of gene sets comprising a molecular signature for a biological process, effects of drug treatment on gene expression, and transcriptional signatures of disease conditions (identified in transcriptional profiling studies using DNA microarrays). An added benefit of the STAR approach is its scalability and flexibility regarding multigene assays. Any STAR assay can be easily updated by addition or subtraction of particular primer pair(s) as long as there is no overlap in amplicon size. Finally, the STAR protocol is adaptable to high-throughput automation that in its simplest form would include a dispensing thermocycler coupled to CE.",

Data for the S gene are shown for stool-derived samples (A) [200,000 (filled squares), 20,000 (open squares), 2000 (filled triangles), 200 (filled circles), and 20 (open circles) copies] or sputum-derived samples (B) [56,000 (filled squares), 5600 (open squares), 560 (filled circles), 56 (open circles), and 5.6 (filled triangles) copies].
