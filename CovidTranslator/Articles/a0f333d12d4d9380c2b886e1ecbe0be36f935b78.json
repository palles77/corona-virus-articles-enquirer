Objective: We conducted a prospective 12-month follow-up study of respiratory tract infections in 12 adult patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia. Methods: Nasal swab samples and induced sputum samples were taken at the onset of acute respiratory tract infection and every 3 months thereafter. Samples were tested for bacteria and viruses. PCR tests were performed for 15 respiratory tract viruses. In case the results for rhinovirus were positive, followup nasal swab samples were taken every 2 weeks until rhinoviral PCR results became negative. Patients completed symptom diaries, which were collected every month. The spouses of the patients served as healthy control subjects. Results: During the 12-month period, the 12 patients had 65 episodes of acute respiratory tract infections, and the 11 spouses had 12 acute episodes (P <.001). Respiratory tract viruses were found in sputum in 54% of the infections. Rhinovirus was the most common virus. In more than half of our patients, rhinoviral PCR results stayed positive for more than 2 months. The most longacting persistence with the same rhinovirus was 4 months. Conclusions: Despite adequate immunoglobulin replacement therapy, patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia have increased susceptibility to respiratory tract viral infections. Rhinoviral infections are frequent and prolonged. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2010;126:120-6.)",

Enteroviruses, however, are an exception. Systemic enterovirus infections (echoviruses, coxsackieviruses, and vaccine-related polioviruses) have caused severe morbidity and high mortality rates in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. 2, 3 Fatal enterovirus-induced meningoenchephalitis has been described in case reports in patients with primary X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). However, chronic enterovirus-induced meningitis has become less common in recent years since the use of higher immunoglobulin doses. 4 The occurrence of other picornaviruses, such as rhinoviral infections in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia, is not known. Thus far, respiratory tract viral infections have not been studied in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia. Using modern diagnostic techniques, we wanted to study the occurrence of respiratory tract infections, especially viral infections, in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia who were receiving regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy.",

It is well established that otherwise healthy adults have annually 1 to 2 episodes of respiratory tract infection. 8 Half of the 65 respiratory episodes in our patients were associated with respiratory tract viruses, showing the increased susceptibility to respiratory tract viral infections. There are no previous studies focused on respiratory tract viruses in acute or chronic respiratory tract infections in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. We have earlier searched for respiratory tract viruses in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and maxillary sinus lavage samples at the time when patients with hypogammaglobulinemia were free from acute infection. 9, 10 An interesting observation in this study was that patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia had recurrent and persistent rhinoviral infections. Rhinovirus was the most common pathogen in respiratory tract infections, and results for it were positive in one third of the infections. Rhinovirus was found both as a sole pathogen and also together with bacteria. Rhinoviruses have been shown to induce proinflammatory response in the lower airways. [11] [12] [13] Chronic inflammation might predispose patients to a progression of pulmonary changes, even if the immunoglobulin replacement therapy is adequate. 14 Previously, chronic rhinoviral infection with the same virus in the lower respiratory tract has been described in immunocompromised lung transplant recipients. 15 In immunocompetent adults rhinoviral clearance is usually rapid, on average 1 to 2 weeks. 7, 16 In immunocompetent children rhinoviral shedding has been shown to persist for up to 3 weeks, but prolonged shedding for months has not been documented in immunocompetent subjects. 17 Consequently, continuous viral RNA detection for months suggests active replication and persistent infection. In more than half of our patients, rhinoviral PCR results were positive for more than 2 months. Frequent rhinoviral infections raise the question of the possible role of the absence of secretory IgA in the defense against rhinoviruses.",

Chronic enteroviral encephalitis is frequently a fatal complication in patients with agammaglobulinemia. 20, 21 In a review of 90 cases of chronic enteroviral infections in patients with primary immunodeficiency, enteroviruses were usually isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid, and the major signs and symptoms were neurological. Echoviruses were the most common enteroviruses. In only 5 patients were enteroviruses documented in the respiratory tract. 3 A more recent report of 201 patients with XLA also showed that enteroviruses were the most common causes in central nervous system infections. 22 Several vaccine-and non-vaccine-associated poliomyelitis case reports have been published, and patients with hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported to chronically excrete poliovirus. [23] [24] [25] Patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia appear to have a more severe clinical course of certain viral infections, such as hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus, and varicella zoster virus, than immunocompetent subjects. [26] [27] [28] Wheat et al 29 studied the prevalence of human herpesvirus 8 infection in patients with CVID and found that patients with granulomatous or lymphocytic interstitial lung disease had a markedly higher prevalence of human herpesvirus 8 than patients without granulomatous/lymphocytic interstitial lung disease. These data further suggest that antiviral competence is not intact in a group of patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia.",

Repeated antibiotic treatments were considered necessary in many patients. This is in agreement with the observations of a recent follow-up study in Italy that showed that patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia tend to have recurrent bacterial bronchitis despite replacement therapy. 30 Mixed viral-bacterial coinfection was detected in one fourth of the patients at the onset of acute infection. Viral-bacterial infection might induce more severe inflammation in the lower respiratory tract than sole viral or bacterial infection. 31 It has recently been shown that rhinovirus induces impairment of the antibacterial host defense and thereby predisposes the patient to coinfections with bacteria and probably with other viruses and furthermore to development of pulmonary changes. 32 The mechanisms of increased susceptibility to respiratory tract viral infections in hypogammaglobulinemic patients are unclear. In patients with XLA, Btk is defective. Btk is a cytoplasmic nonreceptor tyrosine kinase and a member of the Tec family. Btk is important in Toll-like receptor (TLR) 8 and TLR9 signalling. Both TLR8 and TLR9 are important in the activation of host defense against viral and bacterial infections. Defective triggering of TLRs leads to impaired production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-6. TLR8 recognizes single-stranded RNA. TLR9 recognizes unmethylated CpG motifs that exist in both viral and bacterial DNA. Patients with XLA have impaired IL-6, which might explain their susceptibility to viral infections. 33 Patients with CVID also presented with prolonged persistence of rhinovirus. Impaired IL-6 and IL-10 production, as well as TLR9 activation defects, have been demonstrated in patients with CVID. 34 This might partly explain the persistence of rhinovirus.",

Adequate immunoglobulin replacement therapy is not effective in preventing respiratory tract viral infection, and other kinds of treatments are needed.
