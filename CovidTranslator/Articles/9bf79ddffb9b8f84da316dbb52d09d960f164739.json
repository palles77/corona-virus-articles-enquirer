With over 200,000 29 confirmed cases to date, this pandemic continues to expand, spurring research to discover 30 vaccines and therapies. SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for this disease. It 31 initiates entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the 32 receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein (S). Disrupting the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding 33 to ACE2 with designer drugs has the potential to inhibit the virus from entering human cells, 34 presenting a new modality for therapeutic intervention. Peptide-based binders are an attractive 35 solution to inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction by adequately covering the extended protein contact 36",

Excess of SBP1 therefore, could potentially cover spike proteins on SARS-CoV-2 153 surface and outcompete the binding for ACE2.

The starting 133 point of the binding simulations was the cryo-electron microscopy model of SARS-CoV-2 spike 134 protein and several peptides derived from the SARS-CoV-2-spike binding domain of human ACE2 135 protein.
