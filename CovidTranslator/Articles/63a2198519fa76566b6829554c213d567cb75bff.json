Our study revealed that the spectrum and production of ten compounds, under investigation, were higher in organized tissue than the undifferentiated mass, however, aerial portions of the in vitro raised plants (leaf and stem) were found to be devoid of therapeutically relevant triterpenoid, glycyrrhizin. A correlation was observed between cell maturation, morphological differentiation and glycyrrhizin accumulation. Mature stolons (4 months) were characterized by the maximum accumulation of glycyrrhizin (8.60 lg/mg) in in vitro plantlets. The cytotoxic effect of the extracts evaluated against a panel of human cancer cell lines (in vitro) indicated that the pancreatic cell line (MIA-PaCa-2) were sensitive to all the fourteen extracts investigated. To the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive report relating plant growth regulators to metabolite spectrum and cytotoxic assessment in in vitro raised G. glabra cultures. Overall, our findings demonstrated that the metabolite spectrum of in vitro raised morphogenetic lines, under different stages of maturation, might offer a platform to understand the regulatory aspects of the concerned metabolite pathway and their consequent role in differentiation.",

Many of these compounds found in Licorice roots (Glycyrrhiza glabra/Glycyrrhiza uralensis) have received attention in the recent years owing to their multitude of biological activities (Asl and Hosseinzadeh 2008) . The root extract has shown to possess anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, anti-ulcer, anti-allergy (Park et al. 2004) , and antiviral activity against various DNA and RNA viruses (Fiore et al. 2008) , including human immunodeficiency virus (Ito et al. 1988 ) and coronavirus (Cinatl et al. 2003) .

            "text": "Since almost all the licorice root used in mercantile, is collected from wild resources, therefore, its high demand and low supply has invited establishing alternative systems for production in renewable resources. However, selection of highly productive lines and optimization of chemical and physical culture milieu of the cells for copious production is a prerequisite for the commercial application of these systems. It has been demonstrated that the biosynthetic activity of cultured cells can be enhanced by regulating various factors like environment (Ayabe et al. 1990 ), selecting hyper-producing lines (Jiao et al. 2014; Mardamshin et al. 1994) precursor feeding (Yang et al. 2007a (Yang et al. , 2010 and transformation method . The expanding commercial importance of the plant based anti-cancer compound has kindled the researchers to look for their production in tissue culture system. Exploitation of the biosynthetic capabilities of different cell types under a defined set of parameters, would not only give higher yields of the desired compound but will also provide deeper insight into regulatory processes thereon. Various in vitro systems including callus, organ (Gupta et al. 2013) , cell suspension (Yang et al. 2006 (Yang et al. , 2007b root (Du et al. 2001 ) and shoot cultures (Kojoma et al. 2010) , have been exploited and subjected to terpenoid and flavonoid investigations in the past. In-vitro culture based metabolite analyses have shown the presence of flavonoids, chalcones and isoflavonoids (Kobayashi et al. 1985) . Flavonoids like formononetin, isoliquiritigenin, echinatin, glabridine (Man et al. 2012; Tamura and Oda 1996) , liquiritigenin, p-hydroxy benzoic acid, 3 0 -hydroxy formononetin have been reported from the in vitro culture lines of Glycyrrhiza species. A recent study on adventitious roots of G. uralensis revealed production of flavonoids at par with the intact plant . Similar results on flavonoid hyper-producing cultures were reported by (Man et al. 2013) in suspended cells of Glycyrrhiza. However, reports on oleanane-type triterpenoids (glycyrrhizin and glycyrritinic acid) are few and recent (Gupta et al. 2013; Shirazi et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2006 ). On the contrary, lupane type triterpenoids (betulinic acid) and soya saponins, have been found in most of the earlier studies pertaining to tissue culture raised plants (Hayashi et al. 1988) , exhibiting metabolite distribution pattern in various organs of the in vitro plant (Hayashi et al. 1988) . Literature survey revealed most of the studies on terpenoids and flavonoids detection in in vitro plant cultures remain restricted to few compounds (Hayashi et al. 1988; Yang et al. 2007b) , restraining a comprehensive picture of the metabolite composition. Until now, only a single report on the chemical analysis of six flavonoids and two terpenoids in suspension cells of G. uralensis has been accounted (Man et al. 2013 ). Here we are reporting the simultaneous assessment of ten compounds-eight flavonoids (butin, quercetin, isoliquiritigenin, formononetin, glabridin, 4 0 -O-methylglabridine, hispaglabridin A and hispaglabridin B) and two terpenoids (glycyrrhizin and 18a-glycyrritinic acid) in the licorice root and in vitro raised callus, organ culture and plantlets of G. glabra. Also, the in vitro cytotoxicity, against a panel of four human cancer cell lines, were evaluated for these samples. The present study broadens the concept to investigate the biosynthetic potential of in vitro raised G. glabra cultures.",

The metabolite spectrum of triterpenoids and flavonoids in the aerial and underground parts of plantlets were found to deviate significantly. The biologically active triterpenoid saponins (glycyrrhizin and 18-a glycyrrhetinic acid) were not detected in the aerial part of the 4 months old in vitro raised plantlet (TC1). However, underground rhizome showed presence of (8.60 lg/mg) glycyrrhizin. Among the organ culture analyzed, roots originating from in vitro plantlets, axenic root cultures (TR1 & TR2), yellow stolons (TC3), brown stolons (TC4) and brown root callus (TR2 & H7), produced glycyrrhizin under in vitro conditions. The glycyrrhizin content in these morphogenetic lines varied widely between 0.15 and 13.35 lg/mg. Analysis of the organ cultures revealed that the mature brown stolons (4 weeks) had a better capacity to form glycyrrhizin (1.9 lg/mg) than the yellow/green immature (2 weeks) stolons (0.19 lg/mg). Similarly, older roots showed more glycyrrhizin content (0.37 lg/mg) than the younger cultures (0.15 lg/mg). Further observations exhibited root cultures grown in solid media, in isolation, produced least glycyrrhizin. It seems certain amount of maturation along with differentiation is required for glycyrrhizin biosynthesis. Hayashi et al. (1988) had concluded similarly observing thickening of the roots and xylem tissues being tightly associated with glycyrrhizin accumulation (Hayashi et al. 1988 ). Literature has limited reports on glycyrrhizin production in cell cultures. Nevertheless, the results of the present study corroborated well with earlier studies on in vitro raised stolons of G. glabra (Gupta et al. 2013) , G. uralensis (Kojoma et al. 2010) , callus tissues (Wongwicha et al. 2008 ) and suspension cultures in Glycyrrhiza species. The present study also detected glycyrrhitinic acid, aglycon of glycyrrhizin, in appreciable amount (4.6 lg/mg) in one of the axenic root culture (H2).",

            "text": "Basal medium and plant growth regulators (PGRs) play a significant role in tissue morphogenesis, differentiation and secondary metabolite production (Raj et al. 2015) . As most of the terpenoids and flavonoids were found in the licorice roots, the role of basal media composition and PGR effect on root tissue differentiation and secondary metabolite production was investigated in in vitro raised cultures of G. glabra. Five basal media namely, full strength Murashige and Skoog (FMS), half strength MS (HMS), R medium (MS with different vitamin composition), White's (W) and Gamborg's (B) media supplemented with seven (1-7) PGR combinations were used to assess the response of in vitro raised root explants. Simultaneous quantification of all the lines in various combinations demonstrated that irrespective of the basal medium, the root explants evoked three types of morphogenetic response, in 47 % of the cultures (16/35). Five out of sixteen cultures showed a very weak response, either due to the browning of the callus or very slow growth and hence were not studied further. Among the cultures responded, root ? callus mixed morphology was observed in 8 cultures (50 %) while pure callus and pure root morphology were seen in 5 and 3 PGR combinations, respectively. Maximum response (5 out of 7 combinations) was observed in half strength MS medium (HMS), followed by R medium (4/7) and full MS and Gamborg's media (3/7). While White's medium responded only in one PGR combination (1/7), recorded after 2 weeks of culturing. A better response (4) was observed in MS medium when vitamin composition of full MS was changed to R vitamin combination. In the present study, the response of root explants in Gamborg's medium was noteworthy, as it responded in only 3 out of 7 combinations, and all the combinations produced only root type morphology, unlike the other basal media, where pure callus and root ? callus morphology were dominant. In accordance with earlier observations of Gopitha et al. (2010) , the present study also concludes that IBA augmented media is better in root induction than IAA. Browning was observed in FM6 & 7 cultures, Parsaeimehr and Mousavi (2009) also reported browning of callus when BAP and NAA growth hormones were used (Parsaeimehr and Mousavi 2009) . Wongwicha et al. (2008) reported MS basal medium supplemented with 2, 4 D or NAA ? kinetin growth regulators, to be a better medium for calli induction in G. uralensis (Wongwicha et al. 2008) . The present study also observed better root multiplication in MS medium supplemented with high concentrations of auxin (IAA/ IBA) as was reported by Thengane et al. (1998) . Findings of the study suggested growth hormone NAA in combination with IAA or IBA evoked callusing while NAA alone resulted in root initiation. Similar observations were recorded by (Elias et al. 2015) in shoot induction in Ecinocereus cinerascens under in vitro conditions. The biochemical spectrum of the root explants, grown in different cultures in various PGR combinations, varied widely (Table 1) . Among the flavonoids, maximum flavonoids (5) were detected in root ? callus cultures having the combination of NAA ? BAP growth regulators (F6). As can be seen from the Table 1 , butin (0.31-4.32 lg/mg) and hispaglabridine A (0.53-50.00 lg/mg) were found in all the cultures in varied quantities. Hispaglabridine B and glabridine were not detected in any of the cultures, while formononetin (0.94-2.76 lg/mg), isoliquiritigenin (0.41-0.60 lg/mg) and quercitin (0.27-3.00 lg/mg) were found in few cultures. 18-a glycyrritinic acid could not be detected in most of the samples except in axenic roots (H2) supplemented with MS media containing (1 mg/ml) IBA. The varied chemical spectrum is probably due to PGR effect as the root explants were of same age and origin and were grown under similar in vitro conditions. Recent works of on Anacyclus pyrethrum (Singh et al. 2015) and Securinega suffruticose (Raj et al. 2015) have demonstrated the effect of PGR combinations on plant differentiation and secondary metabolite accumulation.",

All the investigated compounds, except the 18-a glycyrrhetinic acid, was present in the mature root of the in vitro culture, and their quantity was found to increase with an increase in the maturity or age. Further, it was observed that hispaglabridine A was not found in 2 and 4-week old axenic root and stolon cultures, the compound could only be detected in the brown stolons and underground plant part (4 months), indicating a certain level of cellular organization or maturity of the tissue is a prerequisite for its biosynthesis. It was further noted that MS medium supplemented with auxins (NAA/IBA) had a positive effect on glycyrrhizin production. This is also supported by the observation that auxin predominately induced rooting, while its combination with kinetin or BAP resulted in callusing, in the present study. These findings are also in agreement with the culture medium composition recorded in earlier studies where glycyrrhizin was detected in Glycyrrhiza species (Gupta et al. 2013; Kojoma et al. 2010) . Careful analysis of the quantification data (Table 1) showed mature stolon to be a good source of many flavonoids including hispaglabridine B, glabridine, 4 0 -O-methylglabridine, butin, and isoliquiritigenin, while aerial plant part was predominantly rich in hispaglabridine B (62.64 ng/ mg) and quercitin (1.42 ng/mg). Secondary metabolites are synthesized in specific tissues at a certain developmental stage of the plant. Their production is significantly influenced by delicate physiological changes. With a better understanding of the cell culture behavior, their higher production through media modulation can be achieved.",

The isoliquiritigenin content varied between 1.22 lg/mg (mature stolon) to 9.48 lg/mg (the part between root and stolon), confirming the earlier report (Man et al. 2013 ) on isoliquiritigenin production in tissue culture raised plantlet of G. glabra (0.4-9.5 lg/mg). Our literature search revealed no reports on Hispaglabridine A/B, butin, a flavanone, and quercetin, flavonoid detection from the tissue cultures of Glycyrrhiza species. In the present study hispaglabridine A/B were found in most of the organ culture analyzed (Table 1) including underground plant parts and organ cultures. However, the compound was found to be absent in the aerial part and unorganized cell mass analyzed in the present study. The present LCMS-based analyses detected butin in all the in vitro raised samples analyzed, ranging between 0.31 lg/mg (F6) callus to 4.32 lg/mg (H7) in mixed morphology. The observation carries significance as flavonoids such as HispaglabridineA/B, glabridine and butin are being reported for the first time in G. glabra under tissue cultures conditions.",

Present results points towards a close association between cell differentiation and glycyrrhizin metabolism and also indicated the influence of the state of differentiation (under the influence of PGRs and basal media) on flavonoid spectrum. Metabolite spectrum of tissues at different stages of differentiation observed during the present study, offers a platform for understanding the inter-play between gene function and cellular regulatory processes involved in triterpenoid and flavonoid metabolism in G. glabra. It is a well-established fact that the functions of genes belonging to multi-gene families are widely divergent regarding substrate specificity and reaction sensitivity. In this context, medium modulation to regulate tissue differentiation could help in understanding the regulatory mechanisms involved in the production of the studied eight flavonoids and two terpenoids in the plant under investigation. Additionally, the study has further extended the biochemical spectrum of the in vitro raised morphogenetic lines, their metabolite flux and role in distribution pattern inside the tissue and cell differentiation.
