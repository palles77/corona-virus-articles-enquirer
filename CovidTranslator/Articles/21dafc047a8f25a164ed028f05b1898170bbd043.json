The Outbreak Database (http://www.outbreak-database.com) is the largest collection of nosocomial outbreaks currently available-and is still expanding. Articles are filed systematically, enabling those on a specific parameter of interest to be retrieved quickly. As such, this database is an extremely valuable tool on many medically related fronts, such as for educating other medical personnel, providing relevant information during the investigation of an acute outbreak, or addressing scientific-oriented questions. Several systematic reviews on a wide range of subjects, including sources of infections, types of pathogens, routes of transmission, appropriate infection control measures, and patients at risk of infection, have already been published based on information contained in this database. As this database may be used free of charge, all medical staff in the field of infection control, hygiene, and hospital epidemiology should be aware of its existence.",

Support during the investigation of an ongoing nosocomial outbreak Once a nosocomial outbreak has been identified, the aim of the infection control team is to terminate the episode as quickly as possible. A knowledge of the measures that have been successfully used previously in similar events may facilitate the efforts being made by the infection control team to control the acute situation of a current outbreak. However, in such critical situations, the infection control team needs to be able to quickly access information specific to the current situation [7] .",

(2) Search options might be limited. So-called ''open access journals'' are currently still the minority in the medical literature. The accessibility to other articles typically depends on the type of contract between the library of the institution and the journal's publishers. This commercial relationship (or lack of it) greatly complicates the retrieval of articles.

The Worldwide Outbreak Database contains standardized data extracted from a large number of outbreak reports published in the medical literature [6, 7] . Data are entered into the database on a regular basis by specially trained physicians of the Charit\u00e9 University Hospital (Berlin, Germany). As such, the Outbreak Database represents the most comprehensive collection of all kinds of nosocomial outbreaks currently available. This database can be assessed via the Internet (http://www. outbreak-database.com) by anyone interested in epidemiology and infection control. Use of this database is free of charge. After a no-cost registration as a user, an advanced search mode even allows the user to combine various parameters, such as the number of cases, fatality rates, setting (place, time, and medical department), types of pathogens, the outbreak's source, and the route of transmission. The Outbreak Database is an independent initiative and has no commercial relationship with commercially oriented companies. Cases from intensive care units (1,010 outbreaks), other types of wards for inpatients in hospitals (1,309), outpatient care (195), and nursing homes (157) are included in the database. A total of 2,322 outbreaks are currently filed in this database, and the number is increasing steadily. The number of all articles on nosocomial outbreaks compiled in the Outbreak Database and the date of their publication are given in Fig. 1 . An average number of 27.9 patients were affected in those outbreaks (median 12). In 724 (31.2%) of the nosocomial outbreaks, members of the medical staff were also infected or became colonized during the outbreak. There are 240 pathogenic species (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) listed in the Outbreak Database. Staphylococcus aureus (300 outbreaks), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (162), Acinetobacter baumannii (129), Klebsiella pneumoniae (129), and Serratia marcescens (103) are the five most often reported causative agents.",

This is especially true such outbreaks occur in intensive care areas or in severely immunocompromised patients in other departments, such as Oncology. Simon et al. [17] checked for the most frequent sources of P. aeruginosa outbreaks in neonatal (NICU) and pediatric intensive care (PICU) patients. They also determined the risk factors for the acquisition of this pathogen and summarized the typical types of infection. In addition to PubMed, they used the Outbreak Database in their search strategy and included 24 articles (709 affected patients, at least 322 infections, median attack rate 68%, duration of the outbreaks ranging from 5 days to 7 years) in their review. In their conclusion they recommend extreme awareness for an increase in the rate of infection by P. aeruginosa, strict contact isolation precautions immediately after such an outbreak is recognized, good antimicrobial stewardship, and molecular typing of cultured isolates in order to confirm the outbreak. In order to elucidate the most helpful infection control measures for Serratia marcescens outbreaks in NICUs and PICUs, a similar approach as that described above was used by Voelz et al. [18] . Thirty-four outbreaks from 27 articles were examined; the infections included 112 cases of blood stream infections, 61 cases of conjunctivitis, 30 patients suffering from pneumonia, 19 patients with urinary tract infections, 16 cases of meningitis, and seven surgical site infections. Based on their systematic review, Voelz et al. suggest such measures as patient isolation, use of gloves and gowns, enforced hand disinfection, enhanced environmental disinfection measures, and the well thoughtout use of antimicrobial substances. Sampling of environmental sites, however, should only be performed as a ''second line measure'' in the specific case where the application of the first-mentioned measures fail to control the outbreak.",

Fiftythree outbreaks with 458 affected patients were included in the review, of whom 299 individuals had hematological malignancy as underlying disease.

In the following sections, we present a number of examples which demonstrate how this database has already made valuable contributions to the prevention of nosocomial infections.How does hepatitis B virus spread from patient to patient?Lanini et al.[15] conducted a systematic review of the medical literature on nosocomial hepatitis B virus outbreaks over a 15-year time frame(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007). The primary aim of their study was to identify the most frequent infection pathways, with a secondary aim of characterizing the clinical settings involved. The Outbreak Database was one of the sources used to retrieve articles of interest. The systematic review ultimately analyzed a total of 30 papers reporting on 33 hepatitis B virus outbreaks. In most of the cases, violations of standard infection control principles were responsible for viral transmission and nosocomial infections. Heart-transplant recipients were shown to have an especially high risk of acquiring infection during transvenous endomyocardial biopsy in a contaminated environment.",
