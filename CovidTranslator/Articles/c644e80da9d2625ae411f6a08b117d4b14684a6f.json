Under electron microscopy the purified protein appears as a lollipop-shaped structure with a long fibrous tail topped with a globular head (Banerjea et al ., 1988 ; Furlong et al., 1988 ; Fraser et al., 1990) . Similar structures are also seen extending from the surface of the To whom reprint requests should be addressed . 23 virion with the head region most distal from the virion (Furlong et at, 1988) . The head corresponds to the C-terminal portion of al which is predicted, from sequence analysis, to form a complex globular structure (Bassel-Duby at a Nibert et al., 1990) and which contains the cell receptor recognition domain (Negate etal., 1987 ; Yeung eta!, 1989 ; Duncanetal., 1991) . Interestingly, treatment of a1 with trypsin cuts the protein approximately in half, essentially separating the head from the stalk of the lollipop, with the C-terminal half still fully capable of binding to cell receptors (Yeung et at, 1989) . The N-terminal half of the protein represents the fibrous stalk of the lollipop and contains a heptapeptide repeat of hydrophobic residues, suggestive of a coiled-coil structure (Bassel-Duby at at, 1985 ; Nibert et al., 1990) . This heptad repeat region was subsequently shown to be responsible for al oligomer stability and to possess intrinsic oligomerization function (Banerjea and Joklik, 1990 ; . That the N-terminus indeed represents the proximal end is also evident from the demonstration that the N-terminal one-quarter of at possesses an intrinsic virion-anchoring function (Mah at at, 1990) . The actual virion-anchoring domain is presumed to reside in the N-terminal hydrophobic tail (<20 residues) of the protein (Leone et al ., 1991 b) .",

Since the al cell-binding function is manifested only by the oligomeric, but not the monomeric, form of a1 , it is important that the exact stoichiometry of the al protein be known . Based on the icosahedral distribution of al on the virion (Lee etal., 1981) and on earlier stoichiometric data (Smith at al., 1969) , it was initially suggested that two molecules of al were present on each vertex of the virion (Lee et al., 1981) . Subsequent sequence analysis was also compatible with a dimeric model of al (Bassel-Duby at at, 1985) . More recently, however, a number of studies including SDS-PAGE analysis of nondissociated protein, chemical crosslinking, sequence analysis, and electron microscopy have supported a tetrameric model for the al protein (Bassel-Duby at at, 1987 ; Fraser et at, 1990) . On the other hand, analysis of the N-terminal oligomerization domain by SDS-PAGE under nondissociating conditions suggests that it forms a three-stranded coiled coil .",

This was indeed found to be the case (Fig .  5) . By simply reducing the preelectrophoresis incubation temperature from 37\u00b0 to 22\u00b0 or lower, we detected a dramatic shift in the migration rate of the C-terminal tryptic fragment from the 23K (monomer) to the 55-60K (trimeric) position . The trimeric status of the N-terminal fragment remained unchanged, although a partial and minor shift in migration rate was observed . The same down-shift of temperature was found to cause intact al to shift from the position of >200K (A form) to one slightly lower than where the reovirus a proteins (-I 50K) migrated (B form), the expected position for a trimeric at protein . The absolute correlation between stabilization of the trimeric C-terminal tryptic fragment and enhanced mobility of the intact al protein has led us to safely conclude that the at A form (\"hydra\") migrates anomalously, resulting in the previous overestimation of its molecular weight .

R represents purified reovirus type 3 under dissociating conditions . gels, chemical cross-linking, electron microscopy, and sequence analysis have led to the suggestion that o1 is a tetramer (Bassel-Duby et at, 1987 ; Banerjea et al., 1988 ; Banerjea and Joklik, 1990 ; Fraser at al., 1990) . Recently, we demonstrated that the N-terminal tryptic fragment of a1 migrates as a trimer on SDS-PAGE under nondissociating conditions and that the N-terminal heptad repeat region possesses an intrinsic trimerization function . In the present study, we have used two independent approaches, one biochemical and the other biophysical, to demonstrate that at is trimeric and provide a rationale for the anomalous behavior of the intact protein on SDS-PAGE (under certain nondissociating conditions and not under others) which has in part led to the previous suggestion that it is a higher order oligomer .",

Rather, we consistently observed a preference for homotrimer over heterotrimer formation . Although we have not completely ruled out the possibility that, for whatever reason, homotrimers are assembled more efficiently or are more stable than heterotrimers, recent studies (unpublished) suggest that trimerization may not occur in solution and most likely involves a scaffold in close proximity to the site of protein synthesis .

The asymmetry of al is further indicated in the present study from its high frictional ratio and manifested by its abnormal migration on density gradient sedimentation and column filtration .

The N-terminal one-third of a1, which is highly a-helical and contains a long heptad repeat of hydrophobic residues, possesses intrinsic oligomerization function (Banerjea and Joklik, 1990 ; Leone at at, 1991 a) and, as such, confers oligomer stability to the intact al protein . These observations suggest that the heptad repeat region is likely where trimerization of the intact al protein initiates and that trimerization of this region results in the formation of a stable extension which presumably facilitates access of the C-terminal region to the cellular receptor . More importantly, trimerization of the heptad repeat appears to be crucial for the generation of a competent virion-anchorage domain which likely resides in the N-terminal hydrophobic tail (Leone et al., 1991b) , as well as the subsequent trimerization and properfolding of the C-terminal globular head (G . Leone and P . W . K. Lee, unpublished data) . The significance of trimerization in al function is also indicated by our observation that monomeric a1 synthesized in vitro is nonfunctional (Leone et al ., 1991c) and that when expressed as a truncated protein (i.e., lacking the N-terminal oligomerization domain), the Cterminal half of a1 manifests a drastically reduced cellbinding activity (Nagata et al., 1987) . However, once formed, the C-terminal trimeric head is a compact, protease-resistant structure which is stabilized by intersubunit interactions and retains full cell-binding function even when separated from the Nterminal half of the protein (Yeung et at, 1989) . The trimeric nature of the C-terminal globular head also raises the question as to the stoichiometry of the alreceptor interaction . At present, it is not known whether each subunit possesses its own receptorbinding site or whether the three subunits contribute to a single receptor-recognition domain.",

We have found that under conditions previously used to detect al oligomers, the C-terminal globular head dissociates into separate subunits, whereas the N-terminal fibrous portion maintains its trimeric state . The resulting structure would therefore resemble a hydra (see Fig . 6 ) whose mobility in polyacrylamide gels should be drastically retarded . However, under less stringent conditions where oligomer integrity of both the Nand the C-terminal portions is maintained, al would assume a more native structure, possibly resembling a lollipop, and should migrate at a position more representative of its true molecular weight. This has indeed been found to be the case : the \"hydra\" structure migrates at >200K, whereas the \"lollipop\" structure migrates at ^-150K, the theoretical position for a trimeric al . The dependence of mobility (in polyacrylamide gels) on al structure can also be used to explain the chemical cross-linking data previously presented as partial evidence for a tetrameric model of al (Basset-Duby et al., 1987) . One can envision how intersubunit cross-linking of the o1 protein along the N-terminal fiber, but not between the C-terminal subunits, could produce a protein which would very much resemble a hydra under dissociating conditions . Such a protein would have a retarded mobility and would therefore resemble a very large protein .",

Approximately 2 mg each of o1 and marker proteins of known Stokes radii were applied to the CL-6B column, eluted with equilibration buffer into 1-mi fractions, andd analyzed by Bio-Rad protein assay (see Materials and Methods) . A calibration curve of the column was obtained by plotting (-IogK,j\" 2 vs Stokes radii of the markers and used to determine the Stokes radius of at . (B) Sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis of intact al . Approximately I mg of at or marker proteins was applied to 5-20% linear sucrose gradients and centrifuged at 38,000 rpm (Beckman SW41 rotor) for 24 hr at 4 0 . Gradient fractions were analyzed by Bio-Rad protein assay and SDS-PAGE, The sedimentation coefficient of al was determined from the calibration curve obtained by plotting the sedimentation coefficients of marker proteins vs peak fraction number .Figs  . 3A and 4A .\u00b0 Determined from Figs . 3B and 4B .\u00b0 Calculated by means of Eq .
