Examples of classic host responses to viral infections are also described in Table 1. both host-and virus-encoded molecules in the regulation of gene expression and function. Numerous cell-surface molecules and nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) that transduce the signals of circulating hormones in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus have been identified and their biological functions have been elucidated. In parallel, it has become evident that some viruses cause pathological changes because they encode molecules that affect host signaling pathways directly [9, 10] and these actions sometimes cause serious clinical problems (Table 2) [10, 11] . Indeed, viruses have developed some of their unique, highly sophisticated molecules through the mutational selection of protein isoforms that increase the chance of their replication and/or survival inside infected cells, and their propagation from cell-to-cell and host-to-host.",

For example, HIV-1-encoded gp120 molecules, which are located on the surface of the viral particle and have a major role in the entry of viruses into target cells, demonstrate amino acid sequence similarity to the growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) receptor of the host and suppress the activation of this receptor by GHRH. This phenomenon might contribute to growth retardation of HIV-1-infected children [12] . This viral molecule is also similar to vasoactive intestinal peptide, which interacts with CD4, a receptor for HIV-1, to facilitate its entry into T cells [13, 14] .

Tax is a nuclear phosphoprotein of either 37 or 40 kDa that is required for transactivation of the HTLV-1 LTR and the transformation of T cells [19] . Tax does not bind DNA directly but transactivates numerous cellular genes by interacting physically with host transcription factors [19] . Tax appears to stimulate the promoter activity of the gene that encodes PTHrP by communicating with multiple transcription factors, including activator protein 1 (AP1), AP2, Est1 and SP1 [11] . Tax forms a ternary complex with Est1 and SP1, and their binding to the PTHrP promoter strongly stimulates its transcriptional activity [20] . Aggravated hypercalcemia, however, is observed most often in end-stage ATL when Tax expression is relatively low [11] . Mice infected experimentally with Tax-defective HTLV-1 have high levels of PTHrP and develop hypercalcemia [21] . Thus, as yet unknown viral factors appear to contribute to the development of HTLV-1-associated hypercalcemia in addition to Tax.",

Patients with this syndrome have a combination of regional lipodystrophy and characteristic redistribution of adipose tissue with accumulation of visceral, breast and nuchal fat and loss of subcutaneous fat [10, 22] . The AIDS-related lipodystrophy and insulin-resistance syndrome is accompanied by profound dyslipidemia and either carbohydrate intolerance or overt diabetes mellitus [10] .

These proteins regulate many signal transduction cascades mediated by transcription factors, including NRs, CREbinding protein (CREB), AP-1, nuclear factor-kB (NF--B) and the signal transducers and activators of transcription [33] . p300 and CBP have intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and attract other histone acetyltransferase coactivators, such as the p300/CBP-interacting factor (p/CAF) and p160-type nuclear receptor coactivator proteins to the transcription initiation site [33] . Thus, p300/CBP act as regulatory 'platforms' for the transcription of numerous host genes, regulating transcriptional activity of many trans-acting factors and NRs (Figure 2 ). Vpr contains a NR coactivator box. This is similar to those on p160 and p300/CBP NR coactivators, potentiating the effect of ligandbound GR and p160. Vpr penetrates the cell membrane easily to exert its biological effects even when added in the media surrounding the cells [34] , thus, its effects might extend to tissues that are not infected with HIV-1.",

Because Tat, like Vpr, circulates in blood and exerts its actions as either an auto/paracrine or an endocrine factor by penetrating the cell membrane [36] , it is possible that Tat modulates tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids irrespective of whether a cell is infected with HIV-1.

Insulin uses the forkhead transcription factors (FoxOs) to control gene induction. Baseline, unphosphorylated FoxOs are active, reside in the nucleus and bind to their responsive sequences in the promoter region of insulin-responsive genes. By contrast, insulin activates Akt kinase, which phosphorylates specific serine and threonine residues in FoxOs to render them inactive [39] . Indeed, once FoxOs are phosphorylated at specific residues, they lose their Figure 2 . Linearized diagrams of (i) p300, (ii) CtBP1, (iii) Vpr, (iv) Tat, and (v) E1A and their mutual-interaction domains. Numerous transcription factors, transcriptional regulators and viral molecules bind the transcriptional coactivator p300 or its homolog CBP. Binding sites of p160 NR coactivators and Vpr overlap, and both bind NRs and p300 or CBP. Thus, Vpr mimics the host p160 NR coactivators and enhances NR transcriptional activity. p300/CBP facilitates attraction of transcription factors, cofactors and general transcription complexes by loosening the histone-DNA interaction through acetylation of histone tails by its HAT domain. The N-terminal portion of CtBP1 interacts physically with HDAC5 and Rb, which repress transcription. CtBP1 regulates interaction with its binding partners by sensing NADH levels through its NAD + -binding domain. E1A binds to the C-terminal portion of p300 and associates physically with the N-terminal portion of CtBP1 through its C-terminal end. The HAT domain of p300 and the NAD + -binding domain of CtBP1 are indicated in red. This figure is based on Refs [16, 33, 45] .

The primary abnormality of this disease resides in the osteoclasts, which demonstrate increased capacity for bone resorption and hypersensitivity to vitamin D [40] . Immunocytochemical studies have shown that osteoclasts from patients with Paget's disease of bone contain paramyxoviral-like nuclear inclusions that cross-react with antibodies to measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus and canine distemper virus nucleocapsid antigen [40] . Nucleocapsid transcripts of measles virus (MVNP), the negative single-strand RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family, have also been detected in osteoclasts from patients with Paget's disease of bone [41] . Indeed, forced expression of MVNP in normal osteoclast precursor cells enhances formation of mature osteoclasts that possess many characteristics of those in patients with Paget's disease, including increased sensitivity to vitamin D [40] . Transgenic expression of MVNP induces bone lesions similar to those found in Paget's disease [42] . Osteoclasts that express MVNP demonstrate increased levels of TAFII-17, which is one of the components of the general transcriptional complexes that are attracted to the ligand-activated vitamin D receptor [40] . Thus, it is possible that Paget's disease of bone might be caused, in part, by the measles virus, through its encoded molecule MVNP increasing the sensitivity of osteoclasts to vitamin D.",

Mechanical ventilation is required in $10-20% of cases and the death rate is almost 10% [3, 46] . The causative virus of this severe respiratory syndrome is the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a positive single-strand RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family [47] . Subsequently, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a cellular receptor for the entry of this virus [48] . ACE2 was first cloned as a homolog of ACE in 2000 [49, 50] . Although it functions as a carboxypeptidase similar to ACE, it has different substrate specificity: ACE2 cleaves a single residue from angiotensin I (ANG I) and ANG II to generate the inactive forms angiotensin (1-9) and angiotensin (1-7), respectively, whereas ACE removes dipeptides from the C-terminus of ANG I to produce potent, bioactive ANG II (Figure 4 ) [51] .",

ANG II is a potent stimulator of vascular constriction, Na + uptake in the renal tubules, aldosterone secretion from the adrenal glands and vasopressin secretion from the pituitary gland [53] . ANG II also has important roles in lung physiology and pathophysiology [51] . Indeed, ACE and ANG II function as promoting factors for acute lung injury, whereas ACE2 protects against lung injury [51] . As SARS-CoV infection downregulates ACE2 expression markedly in the lung and reduces circulating concentrations of ANG II [54] , it is likely that SARS-CoV contributes to severe lung disease and other systemic complications through dysregulation of the renin\u00c0angiotensin system. This is in contrast to other coronaviruses that infect the lung epithelium like SARS-CoV but cause much milder diseases [51] . Conclusions: virus-induced modulation of host signaling systems as a new therapeutic target Vaccines, which stimulate the host-immune reaction to protect the organism from the entry of viruses, are the most effective, first-line therapeutics against viral infection. This approach has been extremely useful in controlling epidemics, such as those caused by smallpox, poliomyelitis, measles, influenza, varicella and rubella viruses [1] . However, some viruses are resistant to vaccine development by conventional approaches. For example, so far, anti-HIV-1 vaccines have not been sufficiently effective to protect from infection by this virus, despite the tremendous efforts of the scientific community. This is possibly because of the high genetic instability of HIV-1, which changes the immunogenicity [55, 56] .",

            "text": "Anti-viral agents are used because vaccines are either not available or have failed to protect us. Expansion of our understanding of virus-induced modifications of the host signaling systems, such as those discussed above, might prove highly beneficial for the development of new vaccines and novel anti-viral agents, based on knowledge of the potential indispensability of specific viral molecules for the entry, replication, and intracellular and extracellular survival and propagation of these viruses. Indeed, this approach has been followed successfully in the development of nucleoside analogs, such as acyclovir for the herpes simplex virus and ganciclovir for Cytomegalovirus, which specifically block transcription promoted by virus-encoded and virus-specific DNA polymerases [57] . Oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor that blocks the influenza virusencoded neuraminidase, is effective in controlling infection by blocking the release of newly replicated viruses from the infected cells, a step in which this enzyme has a major role [58] . Thus, either vaccines or chemical compounds, including nucleotides (e.g. antisense DNA and siRNA) that inhibit the expression and/or function of specific viral molecules, are promising approaches for the treatment of viral illnesses. Indeed, vaccines against HIV-1 Tat are under development with promising effects [59] . We envision that future research to further elucidate the effects of viral molecules on the host endocrine signaling systems will improve our ability to intercept viral infection and prevent virus infection-associated diseases that affect endocrine systems. and endocrine target organs.",
