            "text": "Despite induction immunosuppression and the use of aggressive maintenance immunosuppressive regimens, acute allograft rejection following lung transplantation is still a problem with important diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. As well as causing early graft loss and mortality, acute rejection also initiates the chronic alloimmune responses and airway-centred inflammation that predispose to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), also known as chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), which is a major source of morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation. Cellular responses to human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) on the allograft have traditionally been considered the main mechanism of acute rejection, but the influence of humoral immunity is increasingly recognised. As with other several other solid organ transplants, antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is now a well-accepted and distinct clinical entity in lung transplantation. While acute cellular rejection (ACR) has defined histopathological criteria, transbronchial biopsy is less useful in AMR and its diagnosis is complicated by challenges in the measurement of antibodies directed against donor HLA, and a determination of their significance. Increasing awareness of the importance of non-HLA antigens further clouds this issue. Here, we review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, clinical presentation and treatment of ACR and AMR in lung transplantation, and discuss future potential biomarkers of both processes that may forward our understanding of these conditions.",

While arguments continue regarding the risk-benefit of a scheduled surveillance lung biopsy program and indications for therapeutic intervention it is timely to focus on techniques to improve the operating characteristics of surveillance and clinically mandated procedures as well as the kappa scores of the reporting histopathologists. The brave beating of a distant drum heralds the potential utility of gene transcript analysis technology to supplant our current \"gold standard\" but while theoretically appealing has not been validated in the crucible of real time clinical practice. Until such time as it is, we are wise to continue quality control measures which improve the safety of the procedure and the adequacy of samples provided to the histopathologists with expert clinical input into final diagnoses and therapies according to our consensus guideline statements.",

Reported risk factors for ACR include the degree of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) mismatching (with discrepancies at certain loci-such as at HLA-DR, HLA-B and HLA-A of greater significance (3) , and genetically-determined differences in innate and adaptive recipient immunological responses to the allograft (4, 5) . Younger age is also associated with a higher rate of rejection in the first year after transplantation, but whether this association is confounded by the indication for transplantation and the underlying disease process is unclear (1) . The impact of both induction and maintenance immunosuppression on the incidence of ACR has been studied. Evidence from ISHLT registry data suggests a protective effect of the interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (basiliximab and daclizumab) when compared to no induction, or the use of the CD52 antagonist, alemtuzumab (1) . However, there is a paucity of randomised trial data to support this observation, and a systematic review could not find a difference between induction agents (6) . With maintenance immunosuppression, tacrolimus is associated with lower rates of BOS than cyclosporine, but the evidence supporting its use over cyclosporine for ACR is less conclusive. Despite Registry data and a single randomized trial (7) supporting its use, a systematic review could not conclusively demonstrate a benefit (8) .",

            "text": "The importance of a histological gold standard for the diagnosis of ACR is clear from the non-specific nature and poor diagnostic accuracy of the clinical parameters or noninvasive investigations listed above. A presumptive diagnosis of ACR requires intensification of immunosuppression, which could potentially be hazardous in the presence of an alternative diagnosis, particularly undiagnosed opportunistic infection. The need to make a confident tissue diagnosis of ACR and to reliably exclude intrapulmonary infection cannot thus be overemphasised. Both may occur simultaneously. Bronchoscopy allows for invasive sampling for histopathological determination, as well as the collection of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and tissue for cytological and microbiological analysis. The usual practice is to only biopsy one lung in heart-lung or bilateral lung recipients. In cases of radiographic patchy disease, transbronchial biopsies can be directed to the involved areas (22) . In the absence of radiological abnormalities or with diffuse disease, transbronchial biopsies are routinely obtained from the lower lobe (and, in many centres, also the ipsilateral right middle lobe or lingula, depending on the side biopsied whereas upper lobes are less commonly biopsied); the geographic distribution of rejection grades amongst the lung lobes has been shown to be similar (22) , and avoidance of upper lobe biopsies reduces the risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax. The Lung Rejection Study Group (LRSG) recommends a minimum of 5 pieces of evaluable, well-expanded alveolar parenchyma to provide adequate sensitivity for diagnosing ACR (23): a study has shown that this amount can reliably be obtained by performing 10 to 12 biopsy specimens, with a resultant low complication rate (2) . Complication rates in lung transplant recipients are low and include, in order of frequency, desaturation (10.5%), haemorrhage more than 100 mL (4%), pneumothorax (0.6-2.5%), post-procedural pneumonia (2%), arrhythmia (0.57%), and the need for mechanical ventilation (0.32%) (2, 24, 25) . Mortality from the procedure has not been reported ( Figure 2 ).",

The LRSG of the ISHLT has developed a \"working formulation of the standardization of the nomenclature in the diagnosis of lung rejection\", last revised in 2007, which establishes the diagnostic criteria for ACR and objectively grades its severity ( Table 1 ) (23) . Perivascular inflammation, termed \"A-grade\", evaluates the presence and extent of mononuclear cell invasion-composed chiefly of T cells, although B-cells and eosinophils have also been described (27)-around the blood vessels, surrounding submucosal interstitium and alveolar walls. The grades range from A0 (no rejection) to A4 (severe). Airway inflammation, termed \"B-grade\" rejection, evaluates the lymphocytic response in the submucosa of bronchioles, which may extend through the basement membrane at higher grades. The interpretation of B-grade rejection is problematic as airway tissue is often not represented on a trans-bronchial biopsy specimen, and airway-centric mononuclear inflammation is not specific and can also be seen during episodes of acute infection. The finding of significant airway neutrophilia, necrosis, granulomas and viral cytopathic effect together perivascular or peribronchiolar inflammation may favour infection over rejection, although it is important to remember that the two processes are not mutually exclusive and can occur contemporaneously. In general, the LRSG advises grading both A-and B-grade rejection only after the rigorous exclusion of infection (28, 29) . Other processes that can confound the histological diagnosis of ACR include drug toxicity, aspiration, ischaemia/reperfusion injury, AMR and recurrent primary disease (26) . The sensitivity of trans-bronchial lung biopsy for diagnosing ACR is only ~70%, and is highly dependent on the experience of the histopathologist (30) . Despite attempts to standardise the histological interpretation of ACR, interobserver agreement has been modest. The 2007 revision has attempted to improve this, but follow-up studies have not shown increased concordance (31) .",

In the cryobiopsy procedure, a flexible cryoprobe delivers a compressed gas at the tip of the probe which freezes tissue on the probe's tip. Disadvantages are the need for intubation, and there are theoretical concerns about higher risks of pneumothorax and haemorrhage. A recent study of cryobiopsy in lung transplant recipients, however, found more representative specimens, with less crush artefact, and without a higher rate of complications when compared to conventional biopsies (33) .",

Schedules for surveillance bronchoscopies vary, but generally involve monthly biopsies in the immediate post-transplant period (when the incidence of ACR is the highest), and continue at less regular intervals for the period from 3 to 12 months after transplant. The rationale for surveillance is the high incidence of asymptomatic ACR (~25%) observed (25) , and the suboptimal diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive tests (described above). Prospective cohort studies have shown that the incidence of high-grade perivascular or airway inflammation on routine surveillance biopsies is 16% and 14%, respectively (25, 34) . However, despite this finding, the evidence that early detection of ACR with subsequent augmentation of immunosuppression alters outcomes in lung transplantation is lacking. A small study randomising patients to either surveillance bronchoscopy or clinicallyindicated biopsy did not find a difference in acute rejection, the development of CLAD or survival (35) .",

This latter approach has obvious drawbacks, not least the pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic variation between individuals, and the future identification of a biomarker more indicative of the underlying state of immune activation and/or rejection would be a much better guide to inform ongoing immunosuppression prescription. Several potential biomarkers are currently being evaluated. Exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) as a marker of underlying lung inflammation in lung transplant recipients has been well studied, and levels are significantly elevated compared to baseline values in patients with ACR (37) (especially in those with lymphocytic airway inflammation), but the specificity is poor, as pulmonary infections also increase FeNO (38, 39) .",

Whilst there is consensus about treating higher grades of acute perivascular rejection (symptomatic grade A2 and above), the management of minimal or mild rejection (A1, asymptomatic grade A2, or isolated B-grade rejection) is more controversial. Some centres will elect not treat in the latter situations, rather repeating the biopsies in 4-6 weeks' time. However, considering that minimal rejection has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of CLAD comparable to higher grades of rejection (46) , and that lymphocytic bronchiolitis (B-grade rejection) has also been shown to be independently associated with increased risk of CLAD and death (34) , both types and all grades of ACR should probably be strongly considered for treatment, especially in patients with a clinical syndrome suggestive of rejection. A special consideration may be the asymptomatic patient with minimal A1 rejection (and no B-grade rejection) detected on surveillance biopsies in whom augmentation of immunosuppression may considerably jeopardise the treatment of a current and serious opportunistic viral or fungal infection-in this situation, deferment of treatment and re-biopsy may be a safer strategy.",

Other potential treatments that can be considered, if available, include alemtuzumab (an antibody to CD52, a peptide present on the surface of mature lymphocytes, which causes antibody-dependent lysis of lymphocytes) (51), and extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP).

One of the biggest difficulties facing clinicians in reaching a diagnosis of AMR and choosing suitable management strategies is the lack of standardised data available, with different studies using various criteria for its diagnosis. A significant development has been the publication of the first consensus document on pulmonary AMR by the ISHLT. This consensus document has provided much needed standardisation of the criteria used to define AMR, which will facilitate universal interpretation of future research. It is generally accepted that this is an active document and ongoing research as well as increasing numbers of recognised pulmonary AMR diagnoses will generate information to help us understand the pathophysiology of pulmonary AMR and address numerous questions, which as yet remain unanswered (56) . In this section we will address the pathophysiology, diagnosis, clinical presentation, classification, and treatment of AMR, and explore some of the diagnostic and management challenges. The polymorphic nature of HLA antigens provides up to 2\u00d710 4 different endogenous antigens that can be presented to T Cells with subsequent activation of B cells and plasma cells to produce DSA that target the graft (59). These DSA may be formed prior to transplant in patients who have been previously sensitized following exposure to allogeneic tissue via previous pregnancy, blood transfusions, or transplantation (60,61), or they may also develop de novo post LTX. The rate of detection of DSA by single antigen bead (SAB) testing in various studies ranges from 10-61% of patients within 1 year post lung transplant (62) (63) (64) (65) (66) , and their detection in post-transplant serum is associated with a significantly increased risk of AMR (67-69) and CLAD (62, 65, 66, 68, (70) (71) (72) (73) .",

The initial activating step is the formation of the antigenantibody complex, which results in an amplified immune response with numerous downstream effects (56) . In the complement-dependent pathway, otherwise known as the classical pathway, antibody binds to its corresponding HLAantigen on the airway epithelium and the resulting antigenantibody complex activates the complement cascade. However, complement is not always necessary for antibodies to cause graft damage, as they are able to directly act on inflammatory cells such as macrophages, natural killer cells, and neutrophils, via interaction with the Fc receptor portion on the antibody, and induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production and microangiopathy (78, 80) . Not all patients with DSA present in their serum exhibit other features of AMR. This could be due to the variable pathogenicity of the IgG subclass itself. There are 4 different IgG subclasses-IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, each with variable affinity for binding to Fc receptors. IgG4 and IgG2 are usually considered to be non-complement binding and IgG3 and IgG1 bind complement with the former having the strongest affinity to the Fc receptor. However, when there is high antigen, epitope level, or increased complement concentration, all IgG subclasses have the ability to activate complement (81) . This may therefore be a case of a \"wolf in sheep's clothing\", where DSA that may previously have been considered relatively benign, can become pathogenic depending on changes within immunological environment such as inflammatory responses to certain triggers (82, 83) .",

However some patients meet criteria for AMR but have no evidence of HLA-DSA and there is growing evidence to support the role of non-HLA DSA or tissue self-antigens (SAGs) which are directed towards epithelial antigens, such as K-alpha 1 tubulin (K\u03b11T) and Collagen V (Col-V). These may account for the unmeasurable HLA-DSA in some patients with AMR (84) (85) (86) (87) (88) (89) . Similarly, there are patients in whom DSA are clearly present yet they do not exhibit other manifestations of AMR, which suggests alternative factors may influence the susceptibility or risk of rejection in the presence of antibodies that can bind the graft (90) .",

Their work has demonstrated that up to 30% of patients undergoing lung transplantation have pre-existing antibodies against Col-V and K\u03b11T, which strongly predispose patients to primary graft dysfunction (PGD), development of de novo alloimmunity, and CLAD (86, 88) . Their group have introduced the concept of the 'two hit' hypothesis for the development SAGs. The initial 'hit' involves an initial lung injury as a result of triggers such as infections with community acquired respiratory viruses (CARV), gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), ischaemia-reperfusion injury, or even the presence of HLA-DSA (91, 92) . The resulting local inflammatory response exposes SAGs such as Col-V and K\u03b11T which stimulate up-regulation of self-reactive lymphocytes and non-HLA antibody production. The second 'hit' is a result of down-regulation of regulatory T cells (TREGS) with loss of inhibition of self-reactive lymphocytes against SAGs which would usually induce T cell tolerance to SAGs. This ultimately leads to SAG autoimmunity Bharat (91, 93) . These SAGs may be a significant contributing factor to ongoing CLAD in patients who clear DSA post AMR treatment using commercially available kits that do not measure SAGs. A study by Hachem et al. has previously shown that more than 96% of LTX recipients with preexisting HLA-DSA developed de novo SAGs within three years of LTX and were strongly predisposed to development of CLAD. However, AMR treatment was only effective in reducing the increased risk of CLAD if SAGs were cleared as well as HLA-DSA. Patients who cleared HLA-DSA but had persistent SAGs shared an equal risk of CLAD as those with both HLA-DSA and SAGs (34) . Ongoing inflammation in patients post LTX recipients and those with end-stage lung disease provides an ideal environment for the above hypothesis, particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have ongoing infection and patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who have ongoing inflammation. Studies have demonstrated a higher prevalence of SAGs pre-transplant in patients with CF and IPF compared to patients with other conditions such as COPD, whereas other studies have shown this can lead to the expansion of auto-reactive lymphocytes. Individuals with these diseases have the highest prevalence of SAGs pre-LTX compared to patients with other diseases such as COPD and alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency (89, (94) (95) (96) .",

Hyperacute rejection can occur as soon as the vascular anastomosis is completed and recipient immune cells come into contact with the donor recipient endothelial cells. Pre-formed antibodies already present at the time of transplant are solely responsible for the devastating effects of this type of rejection. Graft failure occurs within minutes to hours and is usually fatal as a result of acute severe refractory hypoxaemia with respiratory failure. Diffuse pulmonary infiltrates are seen on radiological examination, and histopathology reveals neutrophilic margination, vasculitis, fibrinoid necrosis, vascular thrombosis, and pulmonary infarction (61) . With the introduction of highly sensitive assays that can detect DSA the incidence of hyperacute rejection has been significantly reduced (103) , however antibody responses to donor HLA antigens are not well controlled with current conventional immune-suppression and therefore acute AMR can occur at any time after transplantation (104), with either pre-transplant HLA, de novo HLA, or non-HLA DSA such as autoantibodies to K\u03b11T and Col-V being responsible in mediating allograft injury. A more chronic and indolent form for AMR is thought to contribute to the development of CLAD due to BOS or even r-CLAD, but there are insufficient data to confirm this association (97) .",

In addition 4 other criteria are considered which include exclusion of other causes, histological changes consistent with AMR, the presence of C4d staining on biopsy, and the presence of DSA. When all criteria are met it is definite AMR. When 3 out of 4 criteria are met it is classified as probable AMR, whereas the presence of 2 out of 4 criteria classifies it as possible AMR.

There are no randomised controlled or head to head studies and current data supporting various treatment modalities arise from retrospective studies, case reports, or case series. Current treatment strategies aim to deplete and modulate the production of circulating DSA in an attempt to arrest graft dysfunction. As yet, there are no clear guidelines or consensus on the management of AMR post lung transplantation. Current treatment regimens are based on those employed in other solid organ transplants and include the use of plasmapheresis (PP), intravenous human immunoglobulin (IVIG), rituximab, and bortezomib (120), but results are suboptimal (121) . PP removes antibodies from the circulation and has been reported to ameliorate lung function in some studies. IVIG causes B-cell apoptosis, reduces B-cell numbers, blocks binding of donor reactive antibodies and may inhibit complement activation (122) .",

Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that reduces DSA by depleting plasma cells by causing plasma cell apoptosis. Its clinical use has been supported within the renal (124) (125) (126) (127) (128) , and lung transplant literature (67, 129) , and has been effectively used to treat AMR that has been refractory to other treatments. The administration of bortezomib subcutaneously is associated with less side effects such as leucopoenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and peripheral neuropathy (130) . Other monoclonal antibodies which have been used as salvage treatment for AMR include eculizumab and alemtuzumab. Eculizumab is an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody that blocks terminal complement activation. Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to CD52, a protein present on the surface of mature lymphocytes (131, 132) . Once treated, pulmonary AMR may stabilise, progress, or improve. A complete response to treatment is defined as a return to baseline function, abolition of DSA and reversal of pathologic changes. Partial response is improvement in lung function but not all parameters return to baseline. Stabilisation is no further clinical deterioration. No response is defined as on-going clinical deterioration and continued pathology (56) . \u00a9 Journal of Thoracic Disease. All rights reserved. J Thorac Dis 2017;9(12):5440-5457 jtd.amegroups.com",

Longterm survival remains disappointing, with CLAD being the main cause of death. Current immunosuppression strategies targeting the T-cell responses do not seem to control CLAD, which may suggest an alternative pathway mechanically causing on-going graft damage. AMR has taken centre stage recently as a possible important mediator of chronic allograft injury and with improved knowledge on its mechanism of injury we may be able to identify targeted treatment that will enable us to gain good control and overall improve our patient survival post transplantation.
