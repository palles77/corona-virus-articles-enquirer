Here, we report 16 a high-resolution map of ribosomal occupancy of the Zika virus genome during infection of 17 mammalian and insect cells, obtained by ribosome profiling. In contrast to some other flaviviruses 18 such as West Nile, we find no evidence for substantial frameshift-induced ribosomal drop-off 19 during translation of the viral polyprotein, indicating that Zika virus must use alternative 20 mechanisms to downregulate levels of catalytically active viral polymerase. We also show that 21 high levels of ribosome-protected fragments map in-frame to two previously overlooked upstream 22 open reading frames (uORFs) initiating at CUG and UUG codons, with likely consequences for 23 the efficiency of polyprotein expression. Curiously, in African isolates of Zika virus, the two 24 uORFs are fused in-frame into a single uORF. A parallel RNA-Seq analysis reveals the 5' end 25 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/112904 doi: bioRxiv preprint 3 Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV possesses a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome (gRNA) of 51 ~11 kb, which contains a long open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 \"untranslated\" 52 regions (UTRs) of approximately 100 and 400 nucleotides, respectively (Fig. 1A) . The ORF 53 encodes a polyprotein which is cleaved by host and viral proteases to yield three structural proteins 54 located in the N-terminal region (capsid -C, precursor/membrane -Pr/M, and envelope -E) and 55 seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) (6). Consequently, 56 these proteins are expected to be produced in equimolar amounts during infection, although the 57 former set are presumed to be required in higher quantities for the production of progeny virus 58 particles (7). Indeed, in the flavivirus lineage that includes West Nile virus, efficient ribosomal 59 frameshifting in the NS2A region diverts up to 50% of translating ribosomes into an overlapping 60 ORF, resulting in a substantial reduction in synthesis of the 3\u2032-encoded replicative proteins relative 61 to the 5\u2032-encoded structural proteins (8). A similar phenomenon is also seen in a group of insect-62 specific flaviviruses (9). 63 64",

A prominent peak of RPF 87 density occurred at nucleotide 25 of the 5\u2032 UTR in Vero cells, coinciding with a non-canonical 88 (CUG) initiation codon (Fig. 2B) . RPFs mapped in-frame along the length of the associated 29-89 codon upstream ORF (uORF1), which ends at nucleotide 111 (4th nucleotide of the polyprotein 90 ORF) (Fig. 2B-C) . Additionally, RPFs mapped in-frame to a second uORF (uORF2), associated 91 with a non-canonical (UUG) initiation codon at nucleotide 80 ( Fig. 2B-C) . This uORF2, 77 92 codons in length, extends 202 nucleotides into the polyprotein ORF, and is generally conserved 93 across ZIKV isolates ( Fig. 1C; Frame +2) . Both uORFs were also occupied by ribosomes during 94 infection of C6/36 cells, although uORF2 was more prominent in this case (Fig. 2B) .

In some instances, ribosomes reinitiate at downstream AUG 103 codons after translating short uORFs (16); however this appears unlikely in ZIKV given that both 104 uORFs extend beyond the polyprotein AUG codon. Additional work in animal infection models is 105 required to assess the functional significance of these uORFs. 106 107 Few RPFs were present in the 3\u2032 UTR, consistent with a lack of translation of this region. In Vero 108 cell infections, 3\u2032 UTR RNA-Seq density was on average 68% higher than in the rest of the gRNA. (Fig. 2D) . This location is one nucleotide upstream of the predicted 5\u2032 end 116 of RNA \"stem-loop 2\" (SL2).
