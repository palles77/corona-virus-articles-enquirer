This may relate to the failure of attenuated viruses administered orally to replicate sufficiently in the intestine of the sow or piglet to stimulate a mucosal immune response, and it is well established that parenteral vaccination fails to stimulate immunoglobulin (Ig) A antibodies in the intestinal contents or milk. Recombinant DNA technology offers a novel approach to the development of improved vaccines for enteropathogenic viruses if a suitable viral vector could be found. In this study four potential vectors, fowlpox virus (FPV), swinepox virus (SPV), a porcine adenovirus (PAV) and a baculovirus (BV) were compared for their ability to stimulate an intestinal antibody response in pigs.",

Samples of intestinal contents from the groups of piglets which were positive for vN antibodies were tested for virus-specific antibodies of the IgA class by means of enzyme immunoassays (EIA). For the Bv solid phase EIA, antigen was prepared as described by Summers and Smith (1987) , and the end point of the assay was the highest dilution of intestinal contents which gave an optical density (OD) greater than 0.1 and at least twice the mean OD obtained with negative samples. For sPv and PAV-3, a fixed cell EIA was used, based on that described by Simkins et al (1989) .

The second antibody used in the EIA was anti-swine IgA conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories). In addition, the sera from the piglets vaccinated with sPy and PAV-3 (groups 2 and 5) were tested in a fixed cell EIA as above, but with anti-swine IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase as the second antibody.

The lesion healed within seven days, and no scab formation occurred. In a second piglet two small papules were observed on the skin of the ventral surface of the abdomen 21 days after vaccination. The lesions were still present when the piglet was killed seven days later, but there was no evidence of pustule or scab formation. No other lesions were found when the piglets were killed, and no virus was isolated from the skin lesions or other tissues. The serum antibody responses of the piglets are shown in Fig 1. Virus neutralising antibody titres were low, and were not detected until three weeks after vaccination. However, when the same sera were tested by RIA, antibodies were detected two weeks after vaccination, and quite high titres developed subsequently (Fig 1) . In the intestinal contents, vN antibodies were detected at a titre of 1:2 in one piglet killed two weeks after vaccination, and at titres of 1:4 or 1:8 in the two piglets killed four weeks after vaccination. Similar titres were obtained in the EIA for anti-sPY antibodies of the IgA class in the same intestinal samples,",

However, in response to oral sPv, antibodies were found in both the sera and the intestinal contents of the vaccinated piglets. Although sPv was not isolated from the piglets it seems likely that the virus replicated since a similar oral dose of FPV was not immunogenic. There are no reports in the literature of the oral infection of piglets with sPv, but the strain of spv used in the present study was given intravenously or intradermally by Kasza and Griesemer (1962) . The lesions were restricted to the skin and regional lymph nodes, and the virus was isolated only from these tissues. However, in natural cases of swinepox in neonatal piglets, lesions in the mouth and respiratory tract were described (Olefumi et al 1981) , and oral lesions were also found in congenital swinepox (Borst et al 1990) , so the virus may be capable of some replication in sites other than the skin. The circulating VN antibody response to the oral administration of virus in the present study was similar to that found by Mayr et al (1966) in response to intravenous or intradermal infection with spy. Low levels of VN antibody are characteristic of sPy infections, and antibodies are more readily detected by alternative methods such as immune precipitation (Mahnel 1989) or EIA, as in the present study. Antibodies to spy in the intestinal tract have not been described previously, and it was of particular interest that sPv antibodies of the IgA class were found in this location.",

Circulating VN antibodies have been described previously in piglets experimentally infected with this virus (Sharpe and Jessett 1967) , but this is the first evidence of the production of intestinal antibodies in response to PAV-3. Natural infections with PAV are widespread (Derbyshire 1989) , and therefore naturally acquired immunity could interfere with the immune response to a live recombinant PAV vaccine. It was noteworthy in the present study that, while low levels of antibody, presumably of maternal origin, were found in the piglets before oral vaccination with PAV-3, these were insufficient to inhibit an antibody response to a low dose of virus, although maternal antibodies in the piglet may cause a transient reduction in the number of antibody-forming cells in the intestine in response to oral immunisation (Watson et al 1979) . It is also recognised that, at two weeks old, the piglet is relatively immature in terms of the numbers of IgA-producing cells in the small intestine (Brown and Bourne 1976) .",
