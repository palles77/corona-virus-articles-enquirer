We showed that the secreting forms of S1, S2 subunits and the N-terminus of S1 subunit (residues 18-495) were capable of eliciting SARS-CoV specific antibodies and the region immediate to N-terminus of matured S1 protein contained an important immunogenic determinant for elicitation of SARS-CoV specific antibodies. In addition, mice immunized with plasmids encoding S1 fragment developed a Th1-mediated antibody isotype switching. Another interesting finding was that mouse antibodies elicited separately by plasmids encoding S1 and S2 subunits cooperatively neutralized SARS-CoV but neither the S1 nor S2 specific antibodies did, suggesting the possible role of both S1 and S2 subunits in host cell docking and entry. These results provide insights into understanding the immunological characteristics of spike protein and the development of subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV.",

The spike protein could be structurally cleaved into N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 subunits after translation or functionally differentiated into the corresponding domains without cleavage [4] . The S1 subunit is the knob region of the spike, involved in viral attachment with the cellular receptors and hence determines the host cell tropism [5] [6] [7] . Previous studies in vaccine development against animal coronaviruses suggested that the S1 subunit contains neutralizing epitopes that conferred protection to animals upon viral challenge [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The S2 subunit is the stem region of the spike and its coiled-coil and transmembrane regions are involved in host cell entry and cell-to-cell fusion [14] .",

The SARS-CoV S2 subunit shares several structural motifs with the well-studied gp41 protein of HIV-1, such as the N-terminal leucine/isoleucine heptad repeat (HR), the C-terminal HR, the loop between two HRs, the transmembrane domain, and the aromatic residue-rich motif [14, 16] . However, the SARS-CoV S1 has a low sequence homology with the existing animal and human coronavirus S1 subunits, therefore no protein structure model could be utilized in helping the development of vaccine and drugs. Recently, the advances in molecular characterization of SARS-CoV S1 have been made. The genetic diversity of the S1 hypervariable region observed in animal coronaviruses was also reported in SARS-CoV [17] . A recent report has identified the ACE2 as a cellular receptor for the virus [18] and the binding domain has been defined between residues 318 and 510 of the S1 subunit [19] .",

It was reported that an apparent depletion of T cells occurred in the early infection and a gradual increase to normal level was observed as the patients recovered [20] . SARS-CoV specific antibodies were detected at 7 days after the onset of symptoms and kept at high titer for at least 3 months in the recovered patients [21] . In addition, infusion of convalescent sera to patients had been shown to help disease recovery [Sung et al., unpublished data]. The seroconverted individuals with no illness in the epidemic region [22] and the inability of culturing viruses from RT-PCR positive specimens collected from the patients about 40 days after presentation [23] implied that the neutralizing antibodies could be stimulated rapidly and might restrict the virus propagation. Moreover, in preparation of this paper, Gao et al. [24] reported that the combination delivery of SARS-CoV S1, M, and N genes into macaques using adenoviral vector elicited high titer of neutralizing antibodies, suggesting the potential of using S gene as a vaccine candidate. In the present study, mice were immunized with plasmids encoding various S gene fragments and the humoral responses were investigated. The results showed that antibodies against SARS-CoV could be induced by both subunits and part of S1, and the mouse antisera against S1 and S2 could cooperatively neutralize SARS-CoV.",

Fig. 1 showed a schematic diagram indicating the sizes and the locations of these fragments on S gene. The recombinant S fragments (S R1 , S R2 , and S R3 ) were constructed by joining of short S fragments through overlapping extensions. The cloning sites, BamHI and EcoRI, start and stop codons were incorporated into PCR fragments by synthesizing on primers when necessary. A Kozak sequence was also added to S Na and S La ahead of their signal sequence. An expression vector, pCI-SP pGH , was reconstructed by adding 28 amino acid residues of pig growth hormone signal peptide sequence (SP pGH ) [27] at upstream of modified polyclone sites of pCI (Promega). All the PCR amplified fragments were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced as described [26] before they were cloned into pCI-SP pGH , except S Na and S La , which possessed the signal sequence of S gene and hence were inserted to pCI.

The recombinant S fragments were constructed by joining the various hydrophilic regions of S protein (Fig. 1) , in an attempt to highly express the possible neutralizing epitopes on the exposing surface of S protein. All of the fragments were inserted in pcDNA3.1-6\u00c2His-IRES-GFP, including the full-length S gene, and expressed in COS-7 cells, as demonstrated by the observed fluores-cence in the transfected cells (data not shown). In such expression system, the green fluorescence protein (GFP) was encoded by the same mRNA encoding S gene fragment under the control of CMV promoter, but translated in two independent open reading frames (ORF). Although the number of fluorescence emitting cells and the density of fluorescence were different among various S fragments transfected cells, it was difficult to establish a connection between GFP expression and antibody titers since the antibody response was not merely influenced by or directly related to the expression of antigen. In addition, the expression of S protein was also confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 2) , and the expression of different S fragments in pcDNA 3.1-6\u00c2His-IRES-GFP was detected with expected size.

The non-secreting form of S protein could not elicit any detectable SARS-CoV specific antibody response while the secreting forms S1, S2, and the N-terminus of S1 (S N ) did. The inability of the non-secreting S protein to elicit SARS-CoV specific antibody may be explained by the lack of expressed antigens with correct conformation exposed to immune system for post-translational modification including complex folding, glycosylation, and oligomerization, which occurs during protein secretion and sorting. It was widely reported that the expression of viral membrane protein in different cellular locations (e.g., secreted, membrane bound, and non-secreted form) was the immune response of DNA immunization. Animals vaccinated with DNA encoding secreting form of E2 glycoprotein of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) showed both CSFV specific antibody response and protection upon viral challenge though the native E2 was anchor membrane protein ( [28, 29] and Zeng et al., unpublished data). In addition, a shift in T-helper cell response from Th1 to Th2 was induced by expression of secreting form of hemagglutinin glycoproteins [30] . The non-secreting form of S protein, however, might be useful in activation of Th1 response, as injection of secreting and non-secreting S1 into the same mouse enhanced Th1 response, as shown by the raised IgG2a to IgG1 ratio (Table 1) . These preliminary data suggest that S1 may possess epitopes that could activate T-cell responses.",

            "text": "The obligatory cooperation of S1 and S2 specific antibodies in terms of virus neutralization, however, contradicts with previous researches on coronavirus. Several authors reported that immunization with recombinant S1 protein or plasmid encoding the S1 subunit of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) could induce protective immune responses [8, 12, 13] , although multiple inoculations were required [9] . The first paper on immunizing masques with structural genes of SARS-CoV, however, reported that co-delivery of three viral genes encoding S1, nucleocapsid (N), and membrane (M) protein could elicit a high titer of neutralizing antibody and T-cell response [24] . The authors stated that inoculation of S1 with N and or M could stimulate a strong antibody and T-cell response, in parallel with the previous experience on developing vaccine against transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) [31] . From this, together with the experimental data from this report, it can be hypothesized that antibodies against the S1 glycoprotein are crucial in neutralizing SARS-CoV but the antibodies against other components of the virus may also play critical roles in virus neutralization. Such effects may become significant if the titer of the antibodies, including those against S1 protein, is low. The putative cooperative role of S2 specific polyclonal antibody to neutralize the virus may serve as an additional example which directly demonstrates the blockage of virus entry through the binding to the S2 subunit. Further experiments are desirable to define the exact roles S1 and S2 specific polyclonal antibodies play in neutralizing SARS-CoV and their protecting ability against virus challenge. Results described here are expected to speed up the design of subunit vaccine and the immunological research against the SARS-CoV.",
