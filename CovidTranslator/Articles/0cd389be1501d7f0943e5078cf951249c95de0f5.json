To test new molecules for shortening, alleviating the diseases or to develop new therapies, relevant human in vitro models are mandatory. MucilAir\u2122, a human standardized air-liquid interface 3D airway epithelial culture holds in vitro specific mechanisms to counter invaders comparable to the in vivo situation, such as mucus production, mucociliary clearance, and secretion of defensive molecules. The objective of this study was to test the relevance of such a model for the discovery and validation of antiviral drugs. Fully differentiated 3D nasal epithelium cultures were inoculated with picornaviruses, a coronavirus and influenza A viruses in the absence or in the presence of reference antiviral drugs. Results showed that, rupintrivir efficiently inhibits the replication of respiratory picornaviruses in a dose dependent manner and prevents the impairment of the mucociliary clearance. Similarly, oseltamivir reduced the replication of influenza A viruses in a dose dependent manner and prevented the impairment of the epithelial barrier function and cytotoxicity until 4 days of infection. In addition we found that Rhinovirus B14, C15 and influenza A(H1N1) induce significant increase of \u03b2 Defensins 2 and Cathelicidin release with different time course. These results reveal that a large panel of epithelial functions is modified upon viral infection and validate MucilAir\u2122 as a pertinent tool for pre-clinical antiviral drug testing.",

Currently the treatment of most viral respiratory infections is supportive, but in some cases the use of antiviral drugs is necessary, for instance infants at high-risk, immunocompromised patients or in chronic respiratory diseases. Thus, oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir are recommended for influenza, while ribavirin, and palivizumab are used to treat and prevent, respectively, respiratory syncytial virus infections (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/ antivirals/summary-clinicians.htm); (Jha et al., 2016) . However, no Food and Drug Administration approved antivirals are available to rhinoviruses and enteroviruses or coronaviruses causing Severe Acute Respiratory and Middle East Respiratory Syndromes. Clearly there is an unmet need for this antiviral drugs. Moreover, testing of antiviral agents is, at least in part, hampered by a limited number of relevant animal models for these viruses. In this context, the standardized nasal human 3D epithelial MucilAir\u2122 model having functional characteristics similar to in vivo situation, such as mucus production, mucociliary clearance, and secretion of cytokines and chemokines, appears as a suitable model to support the development of new antivirals.",

Rupintrivir is an irreversible inhibitor of human rhinovirus 3C protease and has a broad antirhinoviral activity (Zalman et al., 2000) . Despite not having passed Phase II clinical trials in natural infections because of poor pharmacokinetic properties, rupintrivir has consistently shown antiviral activity both in vitro and in humans with experimentally induced rhinovirus colds (Hayden et al., 2003; Patick et al., 1999) , and was therefore chosen as reference drug in this study. From the Influenza A genus, H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes were used in this study. As antiviral, we follow the WHO recommendation, which advise the use of oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor, to treat and prevent influenza infections.

Human airway epithelial cells were isolated and expanded by two passages to preserve the physiological characteristics of the cells. Airway epithelia then can be reconstituted from individual donors or, to lessen differences between donors, from a mixture of human airway cells from different donors (MucilAir\u2122-Pool).

To this end, the 50% tissue infectivity dose (TCID 50 ) was determined on common cell lines. An independent series of experiments was carried out with one representative virus from rhinovirus, RV-A16 treated with 3 concentrations of rupintrivir and with one representative virus from influenza A, H1N1 treated with 3 concentrations of oseltamivir. Based on the genome copy number results, infectious titer was assessed on apical washes collected 48 h post infection of MucilAir\u2122 tissues by inoculation of these samples in Hela and MDCK cell lines. Comparison of genome copy number and infectious titers are presented in Supplementary Fig. 2 . These new TCID 50 results confirmed the antiviral efficacy of rupintrivir and oseltamivir in MucilAir\u2122, which was first observed by genome copy number quantification. Results showed that the general pattern of antiviral induced dose-dependent inhibition is quite similar between the two methods. However the decay of viral particles at the highest antivirals doses seems more marked when estimated by the cell culture-based method, rather than the molecular method. In addition, rough estimation of rupintrivir IC 50 for RV-A16 gave 6.5 \u03bcM based on genome copy number quantification and 0.8 \u03bcM by using the TCID 50 method. Similarly, IC 50 of oseltamivir for influenza A (H1N1) was estimated to 9 nM by genome copy number and 1 \u03bcM with TCID 50 . Although the limited number of antiviral dilutions does not permit to establish confident IC 50 values, these results suggest differences in sensitivity between the two methods.",

A loss of tissue integrity corresponds to a TEER < 100 \u03a9 cm 2 . When an epithelium is seriously damaged, the decrease of TEER is associated with an increase of LDH release (cytotoxicity assay) or a decrease of the cell viability. MucilAir\u2122, being long term cultures, have a physiological cell turnover showing maximum 5% cytotoxicity or cell replacement. Significant increase above of 5% cytotoxicity is associated with the decrease of TEER. Therefore, both TEER and cytotoxicity should be measured simultaneously. To compare antiviral efficacy during different virus infections, TEER values were presented as percentage of non-infected control cultures. Among the tested rhinoviruses, only RV-C15 induced a TEER diminution below 100 \u03a9 cm 2 , showing 71.6 \u00b1 5.5% of control at 48 h (n = 6, p < 0.0001), and 34.9 \u00b1 2.8% of control at 72 h (p < 0.001) ( Fig. 2A) without any increase of LDH release (data not shown). Interestingly, TEER was fully restored at 96 h with a value even higher than the control (141.6 \u00b1 3.2%), suggesting that the epithelium was able to recover from the damage induced by RV-C15 within a short period of time. All TEER changes were prevented by a rupintrivir treatment (n = 5). RV-A16 produced a moderate decrease in TEER, which did not reach the level of significance. In contrast, both H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses caused a decrease of TEER below 100 \u03a9 cm 2 at 96 h, reaching 14.7 \u00b1 1.6% of control (n = 3, p < 0.0001) and 19.4 \u00b1 0.6% of control respectively (Fig. 2B , C, n = 3, p < 0.05).

This function is fine-tuned by the quantity and quality of mucus production as well as the number of cilia and their synchronized beating. To measure MCC in the infected MucilAir\u2122, microbeads were added on the apical surface of the epithelia and videos were taken in order to measure velocities of their movement. As mentioned, MCC is determined by various parameters and is highly dependent on temperature. At 34\u00b0C, mean MCC ranged from 65 to 120 \u03bcm/s in non-infected MucilAir\u2122 cultures. No significant mucociliary clearance changes were observed following RV-A16 and RV-B14 infection (n = 5 and n = 3, respectively). In contrast, RV-C15 infection caused a strong decrease of MCC at 48 h (23.1 \u00b1 3.9 compared to 120 \u00b1 1 \u03bcm/s in the non-infected control, n = 3, p < 0.001), and a complete arrest at 96 h (5.8 \u00b1 0.3 vs. 100 \u00b1 5.5 \u03bcm/s in the control, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3A) . This reduction was not accompanied by any cytotoxicity (data not shown). Of note, the addition of 5 \u03bcM rupintrivir to the culture media efficiently prevented the dramatic effect of RV-C15 on MCC (Fig. 3A) . A preventive effect of rupintrivir was also observed during EV-D68 infection, where it counteracted in a dose dependent manner the decrease of MCC (7.1 \u00b1 0.6 vs. 27.7 \u00b1 2.3 \u03bcm/s in the control, n = 3, p < 0.05) measured at 96 h at room temperature (Fig. 3B) . In a similar way, we found that oseltamivir was efficient to prevent the MCC arrest (2.8 \u00b1 1.7 vs. 63.7 \u00b1 12 \u03bcm/s in the control, n = 3) measured at 96 h at 34\u00b0C after H1N1 infection (Fig. 3C ). Rupintrivir at 5 \u03bcM and oseltamivir at 10 \u03bcM alone did not modify significantly the MCC of the MucilAir\u2122 (Fig. 3A, C) .",

This local inflammation reaction is efficiently prevented by antivirals, in a dose dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 4) . However, another important primary innate host defence mechanism in the airway epithelial cells is the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Indeed, epithelial cells synthesize and secrete AMPs either constitutively or inducibly upon viral and bacterial infections (Hariri and Cohen, 2016) . Here we measured by ELISA assays the apical and basal secretion of defensins and cathelicidin, which represent the two main respiratory epithelium AMP classes, during different viral infections. Non-infected cultures constitutively secreted 20-100 ng/ml \u03b2\u2212defensins2 (BD-2) measured either basally or apically (Fig. 4A) . The quantity of BD-2 was significantly increased after RV-B14 infection (94.5 \u00b1 8.6 vs. 46.6 \u00b1 6.2 ng/ml, in non-infected, p < 0.05) at the apical side and following RV-C15 infection at both sides of MucilAir\u2122 cultures, at 48 h , 3 and 3) .

No significant quantity of CAMP was detected in non-infected control cultures. The CAMP apical concentration was increased to 16.9 \u00b1 1.7 ng/ml after RV-C15 infection (p < 0.0001) and to 11.6 \u00b1 0.9 ng/ml following influenza A(H1N1) infection (n = 3, p < 0.0001) and the basal secretion was increased to 23.5 \u00b1 3.7 ng/ ml with RV-C15 (p < 0.001) and 5.3 \u00b1 0.5 ng/ml with influenza A(H1N1) (n = 3, p < 0.0001). At this time point (48 h), both rupintrivir and oseltamivir antivirals prevented the production of CAMP in treated cultures. However, CAMP secretion profile changed with time. After 96 h of infection, no more CAMP was detected in the apical side of the RV-C15 inoculated cultures, while levels are still high (22.7 \u00b1 2.1 ng/ml, n = 3, p < 0.001) in the basal side (Fig. 4C) . High level of CAMP was also detected in the basal side of the RV-C15 + rupintrivir cultures (39.1 \u00b1 2.2 ng/ml), contrasting with the protective effect previously observed with the rupintrivir at 48 h. For the influenza A(H1N1) condition, at 96 h we observed a strong induction of CAMP both in the apical and in the basal side of the cultures (30.6 \u00b1 3.6 ng/ ml and 65.1 \u00b1 5.3 ng/ml, respectively).

To test new molecules intended to shorten or alleviate these pathologies, or to develop new antiviral approaches, relevant human models are clearly mandatory, due to species as well as cellular tropism of each virus. To study respiratory infections, traditionally cell lines and undifferentiated monolayer epithelial cells in submerged cultures were used, which couldn't replicate faithfully the real mechanisms of viral infections in human respiratory tract. Therefore, increasing number of studies turned recently toward ALI models, because of its high physiological and functional relevance, to investigate certain aspects of the respiratory viral infections (Berman et al., 2016; Farsani et al., 2015; Griggs et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2016) . In this study, we undertook a rather holistic analysis of the physiological modifications happening in a human 3D airway ALI culture upon viral infection and revealed the importance of an innate immune response which is virus strain dependent. Reference antivirals efficiently inhibited viral replications in MucilAir\u2122 cultures as assessed by two independent virus quantification methods, genome copy number determination and infectious virus titer obtained by TCID 50 . Moreover, we established that MucilAir\u2122 cultures allow to screen and rank antivirals.",

Indeed, after an early rapid phase of virus replication we noticed a steady state virus production in MucilAir\u2122 cultures. Such a long term and persistent virus production may result from the combination of two factors: a limited number of infected cells in MucilAir\u2122, as it has been previously demonstrated by immunocytochemistry (Essaidi-Laziosi et al., 2017) ; as well as the absence of immune cells in the model. A possible explanation for the limited virus spreading observed in MucilAir\u2122 is the upregulation of specific antimicrobial peptides reported here, as well as the induction and release of specific cytokines and chemokines (Essaidi-Laziosi et al., 2017) . Of note, these in vitro results are in frame with human in situ localization studies which showed that only a small proportion of the epithelial cells are infected by rhinoviruses in the upper and lower airways (Arruda et al., 1995; Mosser et al., 2002) .",

Here we found that RV-C15 leads to the loss of the barrier function of the epithelial tissue at an earlier time point of the infection. This result is in agreement with other data reported in vitro with the 16HBE14o-human bronchial epithelial cell line or in vivo in mice, where RV infection reduced TEER by dissociating zona occludens-1 from tight junction complex and E-cadherin from adherens junctions (Sajjan et al., 2008; Yeo and Jang, 2010) . Interestingly, we noticed that this loss of integrity was transient since TEER was restored with time, due to a spontaneous repair of the epithelium. However, all these barrier dysfunctions were fully prevented by rupintrivir treatment, which therefore might be useful to limit the exacerbation of the infection. Conversely, we found that influenza viruses induced tissue disruption was not reversible in MucilAir\u2122, certainly because of the high cytotoxicity caused by these viruses, as revealed by high LDH release. Indeed, an overactive innate immune response and an excessive production of reactive oxygen species have been documented for H5N1 influenza and other conditions causing acute lung injury (Imai et al., 2008) .",

Ciliated cells generate a synchronized movement in the periciliary fluid, which is not viscous. Above that a viscous mucus gel layer lies down, composed of secreted glycosylated mucin proteins. The sticky mucus traps pathogens and the cilia move them away. The majority of virus strains tested in this study (RV-C15, EV-D68 and influenza A(H1N1)) caused MCC impairment, with the exception of RV-A16 and RV-B14. MCC disruption is the consequence of perturbation of a highly complex, multi-component system: such as cilia blockage or desynchronization, modification of the periciliary fluid layer and change of the viscoelasticity of the mucus, etc. (Gizurarson, 2015) . While the precise reason of MCC dysfunction caused by each type of virus is not known, it is clearly related to the cell tropism of the different respiratory viruses used in this study (Dijkman et al., 2013; Essaidi-Laziosi et al., 2017) . Importantly, in the absence of antiviral treatment, no spontaneous restoration of the MCC was detected, even 4 days after the initial inoculation. The decrease of the MCC is particularly favourable for a secondary bacterial infection (Pittet et al., 2010) . To relieve the symptoms caused by viral infections, it would be beneficial to restore the mucociliary clearance.",

These results are in perfect agreement with the BD-2 level measured during an in vivo experimental RV-A16 infection in healthy adults. (Proud et al., 2004) . In this study, BD-2 expression was reported significantly elevated on day 2 and related to symptom scores. In Mu-cilAir\u2122 cultures, we observed that in the presence of antivirals, the level of BD-2 induction is lower or no induction occurs at all. Further investigations are needed to determine if the modification of AMP levels by antivirals will have positive or negative effects on the course of the infection.",

RV-C15 induced CAMP concentration reached a maximum two days post-inoculation at the apical side, while the basal CAMP concentration remained stable over time. Influenza A(H1N1) induced secretion of CAMP showed a slower kinetics with a maximum concentration reached four days post-infection, both apically and basally. However, as with RV-C15, the secretion of CAMP was more important in the basal compartment than in the apical side. A possible explanation is that the accumulation of AMPs at the basal site resulted from the transient or persistent disruption of the epithelium barrier. On the other hand, we can speculate that the different time course of apical and basal release may reflect the dual function of CAMP in innate immunity: an early direct action on the microbes at the apical side, and a later immune regulatory action via recruitment and activation of immune cells at the basal side. Taken together, these results underscore the importance and the complexity of the host innate immune responses at work in MucilAir\u2122.",
