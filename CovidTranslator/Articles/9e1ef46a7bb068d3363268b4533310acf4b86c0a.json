            "text": "Diagnosis of Liver Disease in Domestic Ferrets (Mustela Putorius) INTRODUCTION Liver diseases have been extensively described in small animal species and are believed common in pet ferrets (Mustela putorius furo). The disease remains often subclinical, which may lead to difficulties in diagnosing those conditions accurately. Blood examination and serum chemistry evaluation are useful tools in screening hepatic pathology and monitoring response to treatment. Diagnostic imaging allows visualization of liver abnormalities, especially gallbladder and bile duct disease. Ultimately, histopathology is often required for definitive diagnosis and staging of the lesions. Various diseases have been reported: inflammatory, infectious and toxic hepatitis, and hepatic lipidosis. Less commonly, neoplasia or other pathology may be seen. After a summary of anatomy and physiology of the ferret liver, hepatic diseases known in ferret species are reviewed with their subsequent diagnostic procedures.",

Because cats rarely have ascites due to chronic liver disease, similar findings can be suggested in ferrets. 12 Ascites and hemoperitoneum in ferrets have only been reported with hepatic tumors. 13, 14 Polyuria-polydipsia is also a clinical sign of liver disease in cats and dogs but has not been reported in ferrets.",

Albumin levels can be affected by various proteinlosing conditions but synthesis can be affected by severe liver disease. 19 Decreased albumin and increased globulin levels result in a modification of the albumin/globulin ratio. 19 Liver diseases are usually associated with decreased albumin/globulin ratio. Serum electrophoresis allows differentiating different protein phases. In the acute inflammatory phase, when IgM are produced, a b peak alone is seen, suggesting an acute hepatitis. Then an increased production of g-globulin due to the presence of multiple antibodies is seen, and, in severe chronic hepatopathy, an increase of b-globulin and g-globulin is expected (related to immunoglobulin production). 19 An a 2 -microglobulin peak is also sometimes observed in cases of chronic hepatitis and cases of lymphoma.

In dogs, Helicobacter DNA has been detected in liver tissue affected with primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In the same study, however, Helicobacter DNA was also detected in the control group; thus, statistical evidence of pathogenicity was not proved. 41 Equally in humans, incidence of Helicobacter spp is slightly raising the risk of cholelithiasis and benign liver disease but pathogenicity remains difficult to establish. 42 Campylobacter Campylobacter jejuni is a pathogen that is associated with diarrhea and enterocolitis in several species. Experimental infection of young ferrets with C jejuni caused diarrhea and severe inflammatory response. During the acute phase, the bacteria were isolated in the liver but did not trigger any inflammatory response or histologic change. 43 A similar case reported an intracellular campylobacter-like organism related to Desfulvibrio spp, which was isolated in liver tissue of a ferret affected with proliferative colitis. Liver changes included inflammatory infiltrate. 44 Mycobacterium Ferrets may be naturally or experimentally infected by bovine, avian, and human mycobacteria. Sporadic cases are described in pet ferrets and are common in the wild population of ferrets in New Zealand. 45 M avium and M celatum have been isolated in liver tissue in ferrets affected with disseminated mycobacteriosis. 6,46-48 Experimental infections with M bovis occasionally involve liver. 49 Characteristic granulomatous lesions have been observed in affected liver tissue. 47 Mycobacteriosis remains a major differential to consider with hepatic abscess in ferrets.",

Liver involvement is rare and has only been reported once; respiratory and neurologic signs were predominant. 54 Pneumocystis carinii Pneumocystis carinii is a fungal organism causing pneumonia in ferrets and in immunocompromised humans. Research has been focusing on studying experimental infection with P carinii in immunosuppressed ferrets. In experimental conditions, inducing extrapulmonary P carinii infection in the liver was successful in a minority of individuals, however this finding has not been reported in pet ferret. 57",

Clinical signs are similar to those seen in dogs: weight loss, anorexia, hyperkeratosis of the nasal planum and footpads, and oculonasal discharge. The diagnosis may be confirmed by microscopic examination of necropsy tissues; numerous viral inclusions and syncitia are seen in a wide range of tissues, including the liver and gallbladder. 58 Fluorescent antibody tests can be run on peripheral blood, mucous membrane scrapings, or conjunctival swabs, and vaccines do not interfere with these tests.

            "text": "Influenza Influenza viruses are part of the family of orthomyxovirus and ferrets are highly susceptible. Ferrets are an experimental model in influenza research, especially because of their susceptibility to influenza A and B from human strains. Experimental infection of different strains of influenza induced severe pneumonia and fever, and some strains have a degree of liver involvement, including severe portal hepatitis. [59] [60] [61] Coronavirus Infectious hepatitis and enteritis of ferrets have been reported under the names, epizootic catarrhal enteritis and green slime disease. A type 1 coronavirus has been identified as a causative agent. 37 It is highly contagious with transmission from direct contact. Outbreaks of the disease have been reported anecdotally at ferret shows, in pet shops, and in multiferret homes. 7 Young ferrets seem to experience a milder form of the disease; older ferrets are severely affected. A significant hepatitis and enteritis cause the signs of the disease: profuse, green, mucoid diarrhea, depression, dehydratation, anorexia, weight loss, and death. 7 AST levels greater than 700 U/L in ferrets are suggestive of this disease. Polyclonal gammopathy is also observed. Ultrasound features include peritonitis, abdominal adenomegaly, splenomegaly, and nephromegaly. No change in the liver ultrasound structure was seen in a study of 11 ferrets. 62 Diagnosis is confirmed with biopsy of the liver showing varying degrees of hepatic destruction and the gastrointestinal tract showing pyogranulomatous inflammation. 7 White foci and white nodules can be seen on affected tissue. 22, 25 Postmortem, pyogranulomatous lesions are seen in the parenchyma of various tissues: spleen, kidney, liver, and lymph nodes. 22, 25 Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays were developed to screen for ferret coronavirus. Fecal swabs or sample are preferred. 22 Coronavirus serology is also available and demonstrates past exposure to the virus. These tests alone cannot confirm a systemic Coronavirus infection. 22 Aleutian disease AD is a parvovirus associated with neurologic dysfunction in ferrets. 23, 63 Pathogenesis of AD in ferrets is controversial; many individuals remain asymptomatic. 23, 64 A case report of AD in a ferret with liver involvement was described. 63 Histologic findings included plasmocytic infiltrates in various organs, mainly kidney but also in the liver. Lymphocytic and plasmocytic infiltrates in periportal areas and proliferations of the bile ducts were seen. 63 Experimental infection by mink AD and ferret AD showed a high prevalence of periportal lymphoid cell infiltration. 65 Some investigators report that AD may cause mild periportal lymphocytic infiltrate in asymptomatic ferrets. 1 AD is typically difficult to investigate because asymptomatic carriage is common. 64 Hyperproteinemia and hypergammaglobulinemia can be present but are inconstant. 63, 66 Serology testing demonstrates past exposure but positive titer is frequent in asymptomatic ferrets. 23 Hepatitis E Hepatitis E can cause liver inflammation in humans, potentially causing death in pregnant women. The role of pet animals has been investigated, suggesting a potential relationship and a carriage of the virus. 67 Fecal testing and polymerase chain reaction screening in pet ferrets in the Netherlands have shown evidence of a ferret hepatitis E virus. 68 Clinical importance has not been reported but should be kept in mind in cases of hepatitis due to the potential zoonotic threat.",

Immunohistochemical analysis was necessary to differentiate hepatocellular neoplasia from vascular neoplasm, such as hemangiosarcoma. 88 Concurrent adrenocortical hyperplasia was observed in this case and the investigatord speculated about a possible association. 88 Hepatic carcinoma generally results in increased concentration of hepatic enzyme. 13 Hepatocellular and biliary adenocarcinomas are malignant aggressive tumors that may involve one or more lobes and have metastatic potential. 5 Serum chemistry in a report included elevated ALT (>4000 IU/L) with mildly elevated AST (>500 IU/l) and GGT (>100 IU/L), normal ALP, and hypoglycemia. Cholangiocarcinoma was seen in a ferret colony with Helicobacter involvement. 40 Hemangiosarcoma Incidence of hepatic hemangiosarcoma is variable, according to the literature. Hepatic hemangiosarcoma seems rare in ferrets in a retrospective study. 13 Cases from a ferret colony were reported, however, with up to 22% incidence of hepatic hemangiosarcoma. 89 Its macroscopic appearance can be a mass involving several lobes or a bleeding mass. Few case reports of hepatic hemangiosarcoma in ferrets exist and may have a similar biologic behavior to hemangiosarcoma in other species. Its behavior is highly malignant, and metastasis to other lobes is common. 14 ",

Lymphoblastic lymphoma has been reported with hepatic involvment. 40, 90 Lymphoma has been associated with mycobacterial infection and granulomatous lesion in a ferret. 47 Concurrent liver eosinophilic infiltrate and granulomas have been seen with a Hodgkin-like lymphoma in ferrets, suggesting that T-cell lymphoma can induce hypereosinophilic syndrome. 91 The diagnosis may not be possible by cytologic examination of aspirates unless infiltration of neoplastic cells is diffuse enough.
