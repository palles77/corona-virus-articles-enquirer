Other cytokines released during an inflammatory process can potentially influence MHC expression as well. One cytokine of interest is interleukin-1 (IL-1), an immunoregu!atory polypeptide that is produced by macrophages and also by cells in the CNS. In this study, the effect of IL\u00b0lfl on MHC expression in a human glioblastoma multiforme cell line, U-105 MG, has been examined. Treatment of U-105 MG with 10 U IL-lfl/ml for a period of 5 days resulted in a decrease in constitutive cell surface HLA class II expression and limited the induction of class II by IFN-y. This effect was also observed on steady-state levels of class II RNA and could be neutralized with antibodies to IL-lfl. All class II transcripts examined (HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP a and fl) were affected. Class I expression was only marginally changed by IL-lfl treatment. A minimal concentration of I U IL-lfl/ml was required to reduce class II expression and a kinetics experiment indicated that U-105 MG must be treated for at least 4 days with IL-lfl for a decrease in class II expression to be observed. This study suggests that IL-1 may play a role in limiting immunoreactivity in the CNS by limiting class II induction.",

A similar process may occur in inflammatory demyelinating diseases in the CNS, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) (Prineas, 1985) . In these conditions, class I and class II MHC molecules have been detected on astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells (Dhib-Jalbut and McFarlin, 1989) . Consequently, it has been suggested that upregulation of MHC expression in the CNS may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of inflammatory demyelinating disorders affecting the CNS (Bottazzo et al., 1983; Traugott et al., 1985; Fontana et al., 1987; Hertz et al., 1990) .",

RNA was transferred to nylon membranes (Nytran, Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH, U.S.A.) in a Hoeffer model TE22 electroblotting unit (Hoeffer Scientific, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.) for 1 h at 100 V in 12 mM Tris-acetate, 1 mM EDTA. The blots were then baked overnight at 80\u00b0C. Blots were prehybridized in Hybrisol I (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD, U.S.A.) containing 200/zg heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA/ml for at least 1 h at 42\u00b0C. The prehybridization solution was removed and replaced with an identical solution containing 1 x 106 cpm heat-denatured probe/ml. Blots were hybridized for 16-20 h at 42\u00b0C with constant agitation. For low stringency washes, blots were washed twice for 15 min in 2 x SSC (1 x SSC contains 0.015 M trisodium citrate and 0.15 M NaC1, pH 7.0) at ambient temperature, twice for 30 min in 2 x SSC, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at 60 o C, and twice for 30 min in 0.1 x SSC at ambient temperature. For high stringency washes, blots were washed twice for 15 min in 2 x SSC and twice for 30 min in 0.1 X SSC, 0.5% SDS at 65 \u00b0 C. Minimal cross-hybridization of the various class II probes was observed under these conditions, as determined by hybridization to cDNA clones corresponding to each class II message. Washed blots were either exposed to film (Kodak X-Omat AR) or were analyzed on an Ambis Radioanalytic Imaging System (RIS) (Ambis, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.) using a 1.6 x 3.2 x 0.5 mm resolution plate. All signals quantitated by RIS were corrected for lane to lane differences in the amounts of RNA present by determining the relative intensities of the signal obtained with an actin probe and dividing this factor into the number of counts obtained using a class I or class II probe. Blots were stripped prior to rehybridization by washing 2 times in 50% formamide, 1 x SSC for 1 h at 75 o C. The effectiveness of the stripping procedure was monitored by autoradiography.",

Culture conditions (with or without 10 U IL-lfl/ml and with or without 100 U IFN-7/ml ) are described in detail in the legend to class II antigens on its surface (Bigner et al., 1981) . To examine the effect of IL-lfl on HLA expression on these cells, U-105 MG was cultured for 5 days in the absence or presence of 10 U IL-ifl/ml. When examined by indirect immunofluorescence using the anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibody W6/32, IL-lfl-treated cells expressed slightly more class I than untreated cells, as evidenced by a 1.5-fold increase in mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) (Fig. 1B and Table  1 ). On the other hand, IL-1/3-treated cells expressed substantially fewer HLA-DR molecules than untreated cells ( Fig. 1C and Table 1 ) (a 4-fold decrease in MFI and a 2.5-fold decrease in percent positive cells compared to untreated cells) when analyzed with the anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody L243. Similar results were obtained in four independent experiments (2-to 4-fold reduction in surface class II expression on IL-1/3-treated cells). In addition, cell surface HLA-DQ expression, analyzed using the monoclonal antibody SPV-L3 (Fig. 1D) , was lower in the presence of IL-lfl. IFN-7 is known to increase class I and class II expression on U-105 MG (Takiguchi et al., 1985) . Therefore, the effect of IL-lfl on IFN-7-induced levels of class I and class II was also examined. In this case, cells were cultured for 5 days with IL-lfl as before, but IFN-y was added (100 U/ml) for the last 2 days of culture. As observed previously (Takiguchi et al., 1985) , IFN-T treatment resulted in increased expression of both class I (Fig. 1, B vs. F) and class II (Fig. 1 , C vs. G and D vs. H) by approximately 1.5-fold in each case (Table 1) . When the IFN-T-treated cells were also treated with IL-1/3, IFN-T-induced class I levels were unaffected (Fig. 1F) whereas HLA-DR (Fig. 1G ) and HLA-DQ (Fig. 1H ) IFN-T-induced expression were reduced. Based on these indirect immunofluorescence studies, treatment of U-105 MG with IL-1/3 for 5 days results in a decrease in constitutive cell surface class II expression and limits the levels to which class II can be induced by IFN-T. These observations appeared to be specific for IL-1/3 because treatment with IL-2 under the same conditions had no detectable influence on class II expression (data not shown).",

            "text": "To determine if the effects of IL-lfl on U-105 MG class I and class II cell surface expression were reflected at the RNA level, total cellular RNA was isolated from a portion of the same cell cultures that were used for the indirect immunofluorescence analysis shown in Fig. 1 . Northern blot analysis of the RNA, by sequential hybridization with probes for HLA-class I, HLA-DRa, HLA-DRfl, and actin, is shown in Fig. 2 . Each signal was quantitated on an RIS and was normalized to the signal obtained from the actin hybridization, to correct for differences in amounts of RNA from lane to lane. These results are shown to be right of their respective autoradiograms. Analysis with the class I probe pHLA-1 a under low stringency conditions (that would allow hybridization to all HLA class I transcripts) shows that IL-lfl treatment modestly increases constitutive class I RNA levels. On the other hand, using probes for DRa and DRfl under conditions that would allow hybridization to all HLA class II and fl RNAs, respectively, a dramatic decrease in the steady-state levels of constitutive class II a and/3 RNA is seen, ranging from 2-to 4-fold in a series of experiments. Class I and class II transcript levels were increased in U-105 MG cells that were treated with IFN-y for the last 2 days of the 5-day culture (Fig.  2, lanes 1 and 3) . However, in the presence of IL-lfl, IFN-y-induced DRa and DR/3 transcript levels were reduced by 1.5-to 2-fold in a series of experiments. IFN-7-induced class I transcript levels were unaffected by IL-lfl treatment (Fig. 2,  lanes 3 and 4) . As was the case for cell surface class II expression ( Fig. 1C and G, D and H), IFN-7 was effective at increasing class II RNA levels in the presence of IL-lfl (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and  4) , but the induced levels of class II RNA were lower in the presence of IL-lfl than in its absence. From this Northern blot analysis, it is apparent that the effects of IL-lfl on class I and class II cell surface expression are reflected at the RNA level. Similar results have been obtained in three independent experiments. IFN-y had no apparent influence on actin expression; lane-to-lane differences in the actin signals in Fig. 2 correlated with differences in the intensity of ethidium bromide-stained 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA bands on the original gel (not shown).",

A preliminary study has indicated the same effect on class II induction on primary cultures of human astrocytes (S.D.-J., unpublished observations), suggesting that the findings obtained with the U-105 MG cells can be extrapolated to normal glial cells. Johnson et al. (1989) also made a similar observation in rat synovial fibroblasts. It should be noted, however, that the rat synovial fibroblasts required 10-fold higher concentrations of IL-lfl to achieve the same degree of class II reduction as was observed in U-105 MG or murine cerebral endothelial cells. It has been reported that T cells are responsive to IL-lfl concentrations of 1-10 pM (Dinarello, 1988) . The specific activity of the IL-lfl used in the experiments described here (108 U/mg) translates into a concentration of approximately 6 pM at 10 U/ml.

For example, IL-1 can induce factors that have been observed to inhibit class II expression. Among these are cAMP Shirakawa et al., 1988) , prostaglandin E 2 Dinarello, 1988) , IFN-/3 (Billiau et al., 1986; Fertsch et al., 1987) , and glucocorticoids Besedovsky et al., 1986) . It remains to be shown that IL-1/3 treatment of U-105 MG results in the induction of any or all of these factors and, if so, that a negative influence on class II expression occurs directly. In addition, it has recently been demonstrated that IL-1/3 bound to its cell surface receptor can be translocated to the nucleus (Curtis et al., 1990) . This suggests that the IL-l-receptor complex may be more directly involved in regulation of class II expression at the transcriptional level. Although from the experiments described here it cannot be determined if IL-1/3 increases the turnover rate of class II RNA or decreases the rate of transcription of class II genes, there are a number of possible ways that IL-1/~ could decrease the rate of class II gene transcription. In one, IL-1/3 treatment could induce a trans-acting factor that, when bound to a class II regulatory element, would decrease the rate of transcription. Alternatively, IL-1/3 treatment could have a negative influence on a trans-acting factor that is required for class II transcription. In this case, an extended period of time would likely be required to deplete the available positively-acting factor before a decreased rate of transcription would be observed. The latter mechanism is also consistent with the observation that several days of exposure to IL-1/3 are required to reduce class II expression.",
