            "text": "An indirect immunofluorescent assay (Euroimmun AG, Luebeck, Germany) was used to investigate the avidity of immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, IgA, and total Ig (IgGAM) antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) infections. Serial serum samples from eight patients collected during the first, third, and ninth months after the onset of infection were evaluated. It was found that low-avidity IgG antibodies were detected in 15/15 (100%), 1/5 (20%), and 0/8 (0%) serum samples collected during the first, third, and ninth months after the onset of symptoms, respectively. Low-avidity antibodies of IgA and IgM subclasses were detected in 14/14 (100%) and 3/14 (21%) serum samples, respectively, collected in the first month after the onset of infection. However, IgA antibodies remained low in avidity in a proportion of patients even during late convalescence. As a consequence, IgG antibody avidity assays gave better discrimination between acute-phase and late-convalescent-phase serum samples than IgM, IgA, or IgGAM assays. In two of these patients, sequential serum samples were also tested for IgG avidity against human CoV strains OC43 and 229E in parallel. While SARS CoV infections induced an anamnestic IgG antibody response to the 229E and OC43 viruses, these cross-reactive antibodies remained of high avidity from early (the first month) postinfection. The results showed that assays to detect low-avidity antibody may be useful for discriminating early from late antibody responses and also for distinguishing anamnestic cross-reactive antibody responses from primary specific responses. This may be useful in some clinical situations.",

SARS CoV is now classified as a group 2b CoV (7) . It rapidly spread to affect 29 countries across five continents and caused disease in 8,096 patients and death in 744 (22) . Prompt and determined public health measures interrupted the spread of the human-adapted SARS CoV (23) . However, the precursor virus remains in its animal reservoir with bats (13, 15) , and small mammals such as civet cats within live game-animal markets in southern China are likely amplifiers of the virus and sources for interspecies transmission to humans (9) . As it is possible that this precursor animal virus may again adapt to human-to-human transmission and pose a renewed threat to human health, it is important to maintain surveillance for a reemergence of SARS. In addition, lessons from the SARS outbreak are likely to be relevant in confronting future novel emerging infectious disease threats.",

Seroconversion by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) or neutralization tests is regarded as a gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS CoV infection (17, 19) . However, previous studies showed that SARS CoV infection can stimulate anamnestic cross-reactive IF-antibody responses to one or more human CoVs (OC43, 229E, and NL63) in patients with prior antibody to these viruses (4) . Conversely, while OC43 or 229E infections can boost the preexisting titer of IF antibody to the other virus, crossreacting antibody to SARS CoV antibody was not elicited. This was possibly because these patients had no prior immunological memory of SARS CoV. It is possible, however, that patients with a past immunological memory of SARS CoV or the animal precursor of the SARS CoV who are subsequently infected with OC43, 229E, NL-63, or HKU-1 may indeed manifest an increase in antibody to the SARS CoV titer, giving rise to diagnostic confusion with significant implications for the global public.",

For example, the immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody is often used as an indicator of recent infection. However, in SARS, the IgM antibody to SARS CoV is still detectable at 7 months postinfection (4). Antibody avidity is the strength with which a multivalent antibody binds with a multivalent antigen, while affinity is the strength of a single antigen-antibody bond (20) . Low-avidity antibody is usually produced during the primary response, and the strength of the avidity of an antibody increases over time with the maturation of the IgG antibody response (5) . IgG avidity has been used to differentiate current from past infections with other viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and West Nile virus (1, 2, 14) . In this study, we describe the avidity of antibody responses to SARS and other CoVs and investigate antibody avidity as an option for the serodiagnosis of recent SARS CoV infections.",

Briefly, serial twofold dilutions, starting from 1/10, of each antiserum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were added to duplicate reaction fields of a Biochip slide (Euroimmun AG, Luebeck, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the cells were treated either with 4 M urea in 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS solution or with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS for 10 min.

The IF-dyestained cells were examined at a \u03eb20 magnification under a UV fluorescence microscope. For each serum sample, the titer of antibody to CoV in infected cells treated and not treated with 4 M urea was determined, and a fourfold reduction in titer by 4 M urea was regarded as evidence of low-avidity antibody (2) .

A serum dilution of 1/10 was used unless otherwise specified. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, cells were treated separately with different concentrations of urea (3 M, 4 M, 5 M, and 6 M) mixed with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS solution or with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS without urea as the control for 10 min.

The IF-dye-stained cells were examined at a \u03eb20 magnification under a UV fluorescence microscope. A positive reaction appears as a distinct apple-green fluorescence of the infected cells mainly in the area of the cytoplasm, where fine-to coarse-granular structures containing viral material fluoresce. The degree of fluorescence intensity was scored as follows: no fluorescence was scored as 0, weak fluorescence, 1; moderate, 2; strong, 3; and very strong, 4. The presence of low-avidity IgG antibodies was inferred by the reduction in fluorescence of the cells treated with urea compared with that of the buffer-treated control cells. At a given dilution, a reduction in the score of the intensity of \u05462 was taken to indicate the presence of low-avidity antibodies. The highest concentration of urea that demonstrated the greatest discrimination between high-and lowavidity antibodies at a serum dilution of 1/10 was considered the optimum concentration of urea and was used throughout the study.

While some of these patients may also have had an anamnestic boost in their titers of antibodies to other human CoVs (e.g., OC43 or 229E), such anamnestic antibody responses are of high avidity even early in the course of the infection, providing a means for discriminating a primary recent antibody response from an anamnestic boost in antibody titer. Because patients with non-SARS CoV infections did not have a prior immunological memory of SARS CoV, they did not have a serological response against SARS CoV (16), and it was not possible to on March 24, 2020 by guest http://cvi.asm.org/ assess whether this strategy also would be applicable in the converse situation, viz., in differentiating an anamnestic boost of SARS CoV antibody in a patient with another CoV infection. But we hypothesize that this is likely to be true in such instances where a person with prior infection with SARS CoV or a closely related animal virus is infected with another endemic CoV (e.g., 229E) (9) . Cross-reactive boosts of antibody responses in such persons in response to a human CoV infection may well lead to an anamnestic response to SARS CoV, a potential diagnostic dilemma of major global public health consequences. Thus, antibody avidity may be of use in investigating a patient who has a rise in his titer of antibody to SARS CoV (rather than a seroconversion, which is less likely to be due to a cross-reacting serological response). In such instances, in addition to attempting to detect the pathogen RNA by reverse transcription-PCR tests, we suggest that antibody avidity may help clarify the diagnosis. Due to its pentameric structure, the IgM antibody exhibits higher avidity than IgG or IgA (11) . This is in agreement with our results showing that, even early in the course of the SARS CoV infection, low-avidity IgM antibodies were detected only in 21.4% (3/14) of serum samples. In contrast, low-avidity IgA antibodies for SARS CoV were persistently found (25%) even after 9 months. The IgGAM antibody reflects a composite of these complex dynamics, and this antibody is thought to be the earliest antibody detected; its avidity may remain low in 25% (2/8) of patients for over 6 months.",
