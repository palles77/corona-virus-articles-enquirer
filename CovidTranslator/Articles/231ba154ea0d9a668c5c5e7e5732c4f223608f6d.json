In this study we decided to keep focus on influenza cases, since the data were collected considering in the screening patients with Flu-like disease. Patients hospitalized for less than 30 days were excluded from the analysis, so immunosuppressed individuals or those with other comorbidities (in which ORVs have a greater impact) were excluded. In addition, the association of these factors with ORVs should be discussed separately for each virus, which would make this manuscript very extensive. Below are some references from our group's publications on this topic. Q10. The authors state that \"Results show variations between Northeast (Fortaleza) and South (Curitiba) Brazil in relation to the peak time of influenza infections, which essentially followed the rain season of each region.\" In the case of Curitiba, the rainy season happens to coincide with the coldest moths, with in a subtropical and temperate regions of the world is much more relevant [4] . In fact, the prevalent theory points that low absolute humidity is the driver of influenza in temperate regions, so the Curitiba data is a interesting challenge to this hypothesis (as probably absolute humidity is not low if precipitation is high in the winter seasonsomething worth checking with local meteorological data).",

In fact, the timing of influenza circulation and vaccine delivery in Brazil is a critical issue that affects the effectiveness of the vaccine. Previous reports had shown the challenges of influenza vaccine recommendations when applied to the tropics. In Brazil, which has collected viral surveillance data regularly over the last decades, data from the northern and northeastern regions are still scarce, since they are extensive regions, the population has access difficulties to health care, and there is a delay to referral clinical samples, among others. Unfortunately, this is the similarly valid for other tropical regions. In this way, we believe that more than discussing the possibility of changing the influenza vaccination calendar for the northern areas of the country, it is necessary to discuss the immunological benefits to the target population of the adoption of a specific vaccine whose composition is based on viral circulation identified in the northern and southern hemispheres, which present distinct climatic characteristics of these tropical regions. Moreover, because it is a region with so many low-income countries and due to the possible risk of viral recombination in this region, with the consequent risk of pandemic variant emergence, perhaps all other countries should consider priority to the implementation of molecular surveillance centers In these regions, including adopting, as a result of the monitoring data, a vaccine with specific composition for this region, as well as a more adequate schedule for viral seasonality.",

[Mello et al, 2009; Allonso et al., 2007; Russel et al, 2008] In addition to the need for a different influenza immunization schedule in Brazil, the composition of this vaccine should also be evaluated, since its antigenic composition for this region may be different from that recommended for the temperate region (Mello et al., 2009 ). However, information on strains circulating in tropics is still scarce, since most of the countries in this region have low income and the health surveillance is not completely employed. Besides that, the logistical challenges to implementing a national immunization program with different calendars and distinct antigenic compositions in Brazil meet the need for investments that provide self-sufficiency in its production (Mello, 2009 ).\"",

R: In 2009, the overall mortality rate due to pandemic influenza A virus in Brazil was within the average observed in other countries of the Americas (0.85/100,000 inhabitants). However, in a different epidemic scenario, the mortality rate in southern regions increased by more than 2-fold (Raboni et al., 2011). The impact of the pandemic in this region has led to a greater concern of health professionals and of the population with regard to influenza infection, for this reason annually it has been observed a higher vaccination coverage rates, as well as a greater use of neuraminidase inhibitors in this region, when compared to the rest of the country. Antiviral drug (oseltamivir) was used in only 2% (n = 10) of children from Fortaleza. In some cases, it was observed that drug was used for a long time of days, as the data were collected from the medical record review, there was no description of the reason for the extension of treatment time over 5 days, which is usually recommended.

R: Results Section was reviewed and some sentences were moved to Methods Section, as follow: \"Epidemiological and clinical data comparing patients infected with influenza and those infected with ORV were assessed; only monoinfected cases were included in this analysis. \"To better understand the seasonality of influenza infections in the study sites, we evaluated the monthly distribution of samples and viral positivity. Then, we plotted this information against the temperature and precipitation (historical means) recorded for each month.\"Q8. The authors could make better use of graphic resources to express their results. For instance most of results of table one could be expressed with a few stacked bar charts. The viral co-infection could be summarized with network charts. And specifically to figure #1, given that probably most of the readers don't know the locality of those cities, this figure could be expressed over a map of Brazil. It could be done by simply placing in each locality the corresponding pie chart with the size of each chart proportional to the amount of patients screened in each site, and the internal division of the chart indicating the proportion of inclusion. This map should contain the equatorial and tropical lines, as the relative position of these cities along the latitudinal gradient are relevant for this study.",

It is apparent the authors have taken reviewer comments and revised the manuscript accordingly. While it is an improvement in content and usage of the literature, several of the checklist options I checked 'No' because though many were addressed 'in part' there are still several outstanding issues that need to be addressed, clarified or fixed before the manuscript should be published -see below.Check all bracketed number references in document, sometimes you have a period after the bracketed references, sometimes before, sometimes both. I believe the period needs to go after the bracketed reference, not before and not both.Page 4, Line 29: 'it has been showed' should be changes to 'it has been shown that there is...' P4 L32-36: This sentence is a fragment, revise. Connect with previous sentence or turn into it's own sentence. P4 L36: Capitalize 'host' if it is indeed the start of a sentence. P5 L28: 'in which' -change to 'where' Methods P7 L43-48: As a single sentence, this should not be a paragraph, tack it onto the previous paragraph. P8 L16-41: This is an incredibly long sentence that describes two kits/tests, correct? Break into two distinct sentences, one about each kit used. P9 L18-21: As a single sentence, this should not be a paragraph, tack it onto the previous paragraph. P9 L25: 'viral positivity': As determined by what? RT-PCR, the kits previously mentioned, statistical analysis? Results P9 L50: \"no child under 2 years was included\" -this implies that you actively excluded those under 2 years of age, if so please explain why. It seems odd to include children under 5 in Curitiba and Fortaleza but not in Rio de Janeiro. Reword if needed. P10 L19: remove 'In general,' P10 L47: Define 'severe spectrum' in the introduction so the reader knows what constitutes severe or make note of what was considered severe here. P11 L5-7: This sentence is a fragment, revise, sounds like it should end with a common, not a period. P13 L34: 'codetection of more than one ORV in a single patient was rather common'. As compared to what? Influenza infection? Codetection of ORVs in Brazil or those cities in general? Just more common than the codetection of ORVs with influenza? And in general is it surprising or not surprising that codetection of ORVs occurs given the literature? Any specific ORV combinations more relevant or prevalent than others? P13 L41-P5 L5: I don't understand this paragraph. You compared influenza-and ORV-infected patients. The following sentence starts with 'the latter' implying ORV infected patients since that is the 'latter' infection in the previous sentence, but then the second half of that sentence states 'whereas...ORV infections'. Clarify which you are talking about in these sentences. How do these findings specifically reflect higher virulence in influenza? You only mention abundance which isn't a marker of virulence. Increased mortality or morbidity could point to increased virulence, whereas abundance implies increased prevalence. Clarify how outcomes imply an increased virulence in influenza or change sentence. P14 L7-14: I don't understand this sentence. Circulation in the Northeast was more prevalent the first 4 mos of the year...,whereas a distinct patter of circulation was happening in South/Southeast? How do you compare prevalence and pattern? Did they have different patterns, is that what you mean -where in the South/Southeast infections were more prevalent during a different time of the year or for a different length of time? Additionally, you mention in the Northeast this coincides with higher humidity but you don't mention a climatic link or note about infections in the South/Southeast. Please clarify. P14 L21: Can you elaborate on 'diversity of seasonal patterns...in the tropics'. Do you mean timing of infections/season, geographic spread over the course of a season, length of season...? P14 L23-30: Pull more from this citation to clarify what you mean...what environmental issues caused the 'wave'? Do you see the same environmental issues potentially in the cities you conducted surveillance in? Examples of population factors? Did you test any of the population factors in the publication and did you find they did not matter as much either? This sentence is also worded awkwardly, please revise/reword or break into more than one sentence. P14 L32-39: Sentence sounds awkward, revise. Try \"Knowing the dynamics ...in tropical regions...is considered of crucial importance...\" P14 L54: What do you mean \"...meet the need for investments that provide...\" Do you mean that policies and resources do not exist or need to be found to facilitate the logistical challenges in implementing national immunization programs...etc P15 L3: Change presented to 'contained' P15 L21: 'Performed by organs'?

I've noted below places where changes need to be made but the whole document needs to be proofread again. Perhaps consider redoing the certificate of English editing. R: Thanks for the comments. The manuscript had several modifications during the review process. This last version was resubmitted for English evaluation and a new English certificate was issued. Below it was described the changes performed to ensure that the paper conforms to the formatting requirements of the target publication.1. Overall: The word count of the manuscript (including references, figure legends, and tables) was reduced to meet journal guidelines (\u22645000 words).2. Abstract: This section was renamed \"Summary\" and reformatted to meet journal guidelines.3. In-text citations: All in-text citations were changed to superscripted numbers according to journal guidelines.4. References: All references were formatted according to journal guidelines. 5. Section headings: All section headings were numbered according to articles currently in press. #Abstract Page 1, Lines 5-12: Please correct the sentence structure of the first sentence. There is a comma after 'respiratory viruses' that breaks up the flow and a period after the word 'and'. Capitalization is therefore incorrect. Reword to make the sentence flow better, such as 'There were 3 objectives to this study; (i)... (ii) and (iii) ...' Page 3, Line 29: remove semi-colon these should be two separate sentences.Page 3, Line 32: 'An' should be removed, just start the sentence with 'Finally' R: All suggestions above were included. #Strengths and limitations:Add the limitation of 1 year of data which limits predictions on the impact of influenza longitudinally in these locales. This is essentially a descriptive study. A sentence was included as follow: \"The study was carried out with data collected in one year, which limits predictions on the impact of influenza longitudinally in these locales\".#Introduction Check all bracketed number references in document, sometimes you have a period after the bracketed references, sometimes before, sometimes both. I believe the period needs to go after the bracketed reference, not before and not both. Thanks for the observation. I look for this information on \"Instructions for authors\" and I did not find guide for reference, including manuscripts in the last content the references are superscript. All manuscript was reviewed and references were corrected as suggested.Page 4, Line 29: 'it has been showed' should be changes to 'it has been shown that there is...' The sentence was rewritten as follow: \"Brazil, which includes temperate and tropical regions, exhibits an important regional heterogeneity in influenza peak\u2026\" P4 L32-36: This sentence is a fragment, revise. Connect with previous sentence or turn into it's own sentence.R: The sentence was rewritten: \"Seasonal influenza epidemics are usually associated with \"cold-dry\" and \"humid-rainy\" climates8; however, in addition to climate and environmental conditions, host factors, such as age, preexisting immunity, genetic polymorphisms, and presence of comorbidities, are associated with seasonal variations of this infection, vaccine responsiveness, as well as the severity of influenza epidemics\" P4 L36: Capitalize 'host' if it is indeed the start of a sentence. R: Severe disease already was defined at Methods Section -P9 L18, as follow: \"We defined severe disease as that requiring mechanical ventilation, admission to an ICU, or resulting in a fatal outcome.\" #Discussion P11 L5-7: This sentence is a fragment, revise, sounds like it should end with a common, not a period. R: The sentence was rewritten as follow: \"Comparison of the seasonality of influenza infections with temperature and precipitation (historical means) recorded for each month revealed variations between the northeast (Fortaleza) and south (Curitiba) regions of Brazil in relation to the peak period of influenza infections;\" P13 L34: 'codetection of more than one ORV in a single patient was rather common'. As compared to what? Influenza infection? Codetection of ORVs in Brazil or those cities in general? Just more common than the codetection of ORVs with influenza? And in general is it surprising or not surprising that codetection of ORVs occurs given the literature? Any specific ORV combinations more relevant or prevalent than others? R: The sentence was rewritten as follow: \"although circulation of influenza and ORV coincided over time, the frequency of co-detection of influenza with ORV was very low, whereas co-detection of more than one ORV in a single patient was rather common along with RSV.\" P13 L41-P5 L5: I don't understand this paragraph. You compared influenza-and ORV-infected patients. The following sentence starts with 'the latter' implying ORV infected patients since that is the 'latter' infection in the previous sentence, but then the second half of that sentence states 'whereas...ORV infections'. Clarify which you are talking about in these sentences. How do these findings specifically reflect higher virulence in influenza? You only mention abundance which isn't a marker of virulence. Increased mortality or morbidity could point to increased virulence, whereas abundance implies increased prevalence. Clarify how outcomes imply an increased virulence in influenza or change sentence. R: The sentence was re-written to clarify: \"We then compared clinical and epidemiological data from influenza-and ORV-infected patients to evaluate the impact of these infections. Influenza was significantly more frequent in older patients and those with severe diseases, whereas comorbidities were associated with ORV infections. These findings reflected a lower adhesion to immunization among older children, with the presence of severe disease a possible consequence of the higher virulence of influenza viruses, although no difference in mortality was observed between both groups.\" P14 L7-14: I don't understand this sentence. Circulation in the Northeast was more prevalent the first 4 mos of the year...,whereas a distinct patter of circulation was happening in South/Southeast? How do you compare prevalence and pattern? Did they have different patterns, is that what you meanwhere in the South/Southeast infections were more prevalent during a different time of the year or for a different length of time? Additionally, you mention in the Northeast this coincides with higher humidity but you don't mention a climatic link or note about infections in the South/Southeast. Please clarify.R: In the northeast, influenza season occurs during the first months of the year and is associated with higher precipitation time. On contrary, in the south and southeast it is linked to lower temperature and humidity does not likely to affect this viral infection. The sentence was re-written to clarify.P14 L21: Can you elaborate on 'diversity of seasonal patterns...in the tropics'. Do you mean timing of infections/season, geographic spread over the course of a season, length of season...? R: In this sentence, the context of seasonal patterns involves seasonality, geographic spread and length of time. The word \"pattern\" was used because it encompassed all of these topics. P14 L23-30: Pull more from this citation to clarify what you mean...what environmental issues caused the 'wave'? Do you see the same environmental issues potentially in the cities you conducted surveillance in? Examples of population factors? Did you test any of the population factors in the publication and did you find they did not matter as much either? This sentence is also worded awkwardly, please revise/reword or break into more than one sentence. R: At present, determinants of seasonality and severity of the influenza disease remain mostly unknown. We do not evaluated population factors in the present study, but we could observe during H1N1 pandemic important differences in severity and mortality rates between distinct regions of country, and some population characteristics should be evaluated. The sentence was rewritten to clarify.Comment: I am still not convinced of how climate may play a role in their study cities for the determinants of seasonality. As this is stated as an objective it needs to be clarified/addressed in greater detail in the manuscript. Can they draw parallels between their study sites (climate/determinants of influenza seasonality) and study sites in previous publications that looked at climate impact on influenza seasonality/infections? Do they see similar trends? Different trends and if so, hypothesize/explain why? R: The study describes the results of surveillance of influenza and other respiratory viruses in hospitalized patients. The basis for the seasonality of influenza has been extensively reviewed (3, 4) . However, the determinants of the seasonality, and time-varying changes in severity of influenza epidemics are unknown. In Brazil, influenza infections peak in different periods depends on region. In the north and northeast, tropical climate, the temperature is usually high with little variation during the year, and there is no winter.
