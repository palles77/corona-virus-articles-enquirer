By increasing the time of centrifugation or the centrifugation speed smaller particles will also pellet. Differential centrifugation also separates particles on the basis of their density. Whilst the procedure can be successful in achieving good separation of a variety of particles as long as there are large differences in their mass and/or densities, the yield of such a procedure is likely to be low and the purity of the particles questionable. The technique is however often used as a starting point designed so as to enrich populations of particles before further purification. Virus purification is more likely to be achieved by the technique of density gradient centrifugation, where separation of the components is achieved by sedimentation through a density gradient, (i.e. a solution which increases in density with increasing distance down the centrifuge tube).",

(Minor 1985) Preparations of virus for purification are usually derived following high m.o.i, of appropriate cell cultures (e.g. HeLa suspension cultures) which are freeze-thawed two or three times and then centrifuged to remove the debris. The supernatant is often treated with either ammonium sulphate or polythene glycol prior to purification. Picornaviruses are however often associated with membranes and thus detergent is usually added (e.g. 1% NP40) to free the virus particles. The purification process is as follows: Virus purified in such a way is suitable for most purposes. However some impurities may remain and if extreme purity is required it may be necessary to re-purify on caesium chloride gradients. (Killington and Powell 1985) Herpes simplex virus provides a more difficult challenge than most viruses with regard to the preparation of pure virus particles. Techniques which work well with one virus strain in a particular cell line do not work for other strains of virus in the same cells or for the same strain of virus in different cells. For this reason we give two methods here. Method 1 relies on the virus strain being released into the extracellular medium of e.g. Hep-2 infected cells. Method 2 appears to work for most strains.",

This method is based on the premise that the layering of a virus suspension on to a preformed gradient followed by ultracentrifugation will result in the migration of virus particles until they reach an equilibrium according to their buoyant density. Alternatively, the gradient may be field formed by mixing the virus suspension with a known amount of CsCI in a suitable buffer prior to centrifugation when the gradient is produced. This technique contrasts with the procedure of rate-zonal centrifugation which separates particles on the basis of size. Other materials used in isopycnic centrifugation include organic molecules such as sugars (sucrose) or polysaccharides (Ficoll), iodinated aromatic compounds (Nycodenz) or colloidal silica (Percoll). Hence no one particular compound is of universal application. More far reaching applications of CsCI gradients include the purification of plasmid DNA and the separation of subviral components.",

Suggestions for the concentrations of CsCI to be used for gradient formation range from 1.32 g cm -3 (32% w/v) for a virus containing 5% RNA to 1.7 g cm -3 (55.5%) w/v for a DNA virus. In addition to its high level of solubility and density, CsCI is able to form solutions of low ionic strength and viscosity. Also, at a suitable pH its presence does not affect the biological activities of the virus. Optical grade CsCI does not absorb UV light allowing direct photometric analysis of gradient fractions. Further it does not interfere with the activity of scintil-lation fluids, thereby allowing analysis of radioactively labeled virus preparations taken from the gradient. CsCI can easily be removed from the virus fraction by dialysis, filtration or ultracentrifugation. CsCI gradients may either be self formed or preformed and the latter type of gradient may either be discontinuous or continuous. For the discontinuous gradient, often referred to as a step gradient, different densities of CsCI are layered into a centrifuge tube, beginning either by underlaying the least dense with a more dense preparation or by layering the less dense preparation on the top of the more dense. The virus sample is loaded on to the top of the gradient and centrifugation begun immediately. The continuous gradient is prepared in the same manner but additionally it is held at 4~ overnight, allowing diffusion to occur. More often however, a gradient maker is used to form the continuous gradient thus saving time. For the self-forming gradient, the virus sample, the gradient solute and the buffer are mixed together in proportions that will generate a suitable density range on centrifugation.",

The tubes should be situated vertically, as with all gradients. 2. To make three identical gradients, place 16 ml of 40% di-potassium tartrate in TES buffer, pH 7.2 (see page 176), in the right-hand cylinder to prevent an air trap, and then lead it into the three lines of tubing leading to the pump and centrifuge tubes. This provides a small cushion of 40% tartrate (highest density) which will prevent viruses with densities around 1.18 g c m -3 from passing through. 3. Commence stirring in the right-hand cylinder, either with a stainless steel agitator rod or a magnetic mixing bar. Adjust the stirrer so that excessive air bubbles are not formed and forced into the tubing going to the pump and centrifuge tubes. Excessive bubbles can create air traps and also disrupt the linearity of the gradients. Gel filtration, also referred to as size exclusion liquid chromatography (SEC), gel chromatography or gel permeation chromatography has proven to be one of a number of methods of choice for the purification of viruses and is extensively used in the purification of subviral components including antigens and virally encoded enzymes often expressed in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems. SEC is used in the separation of simple mixtures conveniently and rapidly when the components of the mixture have a sufficient difference in size. The technique uses a solid phase composed of a column packing of beads with pores of a defined average size. The beads have a specific size exclusion so that the separation of solute entering the column is dependent on its ability to enter the pores. The smaller components are able to enter the pores and are retained in the column and are eluted first. Solutes of intermediate size are less able to approach the walls of the pores and spend less time in the pores. These move through the column at speeds dependent on their relative size. Thus separation in SEC is strictly on the basis of molecular size. The retention of solutes by adsorption is undesirable and usually does not occur with the correct combination of substrate and mobile phase. A differential elution, proportional to the particle size (and consequently to the particle molecular weight) can be obtained. The beads are composed of various materials. The ideal surface must be neutral and hydrophilic to minimize the possibility of adsorption. Highly cross-linked, mechanically stable, macroporous matrices from neutral, hydrophilic polymers such as dextrans or agarose have been used for such purposes. The commercially available Sepharose CL (Pharmacia) is a beaded agarose matrix which has been cross-linked. However, cross-linking agents introduce hydrophobic character into the matrix. Pore diameter and pore volume can also be reduced during cross-linking.",

The technique can be broadly separated into two categories, desalting or group separation and fractionation. For desalting, the molecule of interest is eluted in the void volume whilst smaller molecules are retained. Thus the exclusion size should be smaller than the molecule of interest. For fractionation, molecules of varying molecular weight are separated within the gel matrix and thus the molecules of interest should fall within the separation range of the gel. Gel filtration is a non-interactive technique which means that the conditions can be chosen to maintain the stability of the molecules being separated. This is a valuable means of separating unknown samples but, more pertinent here, can also be used for the purification of viruses such as poliovirus or rabies virus (van Wezel et al 1979) .

However, small more rigid porous particles will be used for column packing as opposed to the ones used for SEC which would collapse at high species (tetramer). Gel filtration was then used to purify this further. To do this, protein from one-litre batches of supernatant was precipitated with 85% ammonium sulphate, resuspended in 30 ml of water and dialyzed for 24 h against 3 changes of PBS. Six-millilitre aliquots (0.5 mg gp160) were separated by gel-filtration chromatography using a Sephacryl S-400HR column (90 x 2.5 cm). Threemillilitre fractions were collected and each screened for gp 160 by ELISA. Fractions containing gp160 were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration centrifugation through a Centricon filter with a 10 K size exclusion. Protein was stored at -20~ in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6.",

For details on these systems see Snyder and Kirkland (1979) and Yau et al (1979) . t The steps involved in gel filtration are: a) bed preparation; b) sample application; c) sample flow-achieved by gravity feeding of the column; d) detection and quantitation of the purified virus particle or protein.Some applications of SEC are given below. McGrath et al (1978) used a Sepharose 4B chromatographic method for the purification of a retrovirus. This method gave increased purified virus yields, conserved the virus glycoprotein and the preparation had an increased recovery of biological infectivity in comparison with the previously used method of sucrose density gradient centrifugation.1. Viruses are harvested from infected cells and cell debris pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 g. 2. Clarified supernatant is concentrated 10-50 fold in an Amicon ultrafiltration apparatus using a PM10 membrane at an ultrafiltration rate of 1 ml/min. The concentrate is spun through a discontinuous sucrose gradient (25% to 40% w/w)in TEN buffer (20 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCI, pH 7.5) for 2.5 h at 90,000 g and the virus band collected. 3. The supernatant concentrated by ultrafiltration corresponding to 5% of a pre-sterilized Sepharose C1 4B (Pharmacia) column bed volume is chromatographed at 4~ in TEN buffer. Virus appears in the void volume at a flow rate of 0.5 to 1.0 ml min-1. The fractions containing the virus peak are monitored by optical density at 280 nm and by radioactivity. Pinto et al (1991) used gel filtration techniques for the recovery and purification of a virus from the erythrocytes of sea bass.1. Red blood cells from 40 ml of blood are collected by centrifugation at 2000 g for 20 min and resuspended in 40 ml of TNE (50 mM Tris-HCI, 150 mM NaCI and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) buffer with 0.1% SDS. 2. Samples are freeze--thawed and sonicated three times and clarified by two centrifugation steps at 3000 g and 6000 g for 10 min. 3. The supernatant is concentrated to a final volume of 8-10 mi by ultrafiltration through CX30 immersible units. The complete removal of haemoglobin is accomplished by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration in a 20 x 6.5 cm column, with TNE/0.1% SDS as the eluent. 4. The volume of the first peak of UV light absorbing material to emerge corresponds to the first 10 ml of the void volume. The eluted volume is reconcentrated to 1 ml by ultrafiltration through immersible filters. The presence of virus particles is determined by staining with 2% phosphotungstic acid and electron microscopy. Protein concentration determined by the Lowry's method ranges from 25-250 ILtg mi -1.Whilst being useful for the purification of whole virus particles, gel filtration can be manipulated so that subviral components can be obtained in a pure form. One such example is work carried out on the oligomeric form of the gp160 glycoprotein of simian immunodeficiency virus. It is possible to purify oligomeric forms of SIV gp160 to greater than 90% purity using a simple gel filtration method (Rhodes et al 1994) . Concentrated samples of CHO supernatants from cells expressing gp160 are filtered through Sepharose 6B (Sigma). 0.5 ml volumes from the column are collected and analysed for the presence of gp120/160 by ELISA. These results demonstrated that the major form of sgp160 existed as a 660 K",
