Methods: All unformed stool was tested for the presence of Toxin A (TcdA) and Toxin B (TcdB), and cultured for C. difficile. Culture filtrates were also tested for TcdA and TcdB. Detection of tcdA and tcdB genes was carried out for A 2 B + strains by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of metronidazole, vancomycin and clindamycin for all isolates were tested using the Etest. PCR ribotyping was carried out on all isolates. Results: The incidence of Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD) was 3.2 cases per 1000 admissions or discharges and 53.8 cases per 100 000 patient days. Most cases occurred in renal and haematology patients. CDAD was more common in patients aged over 50 years and of male gender. The Indian population was under-represented. Fourteen (11.8%) isolates were A 2 B + . All strains were susceptible to metronidazole but one strain showed intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Only 12.8% of the isolates were susceptible to clindamycin. Thirty-five isolates had PCR ribotype A, of which 29 (83%) had a clindamycin MIC .256 mg/L. Thirty-three had PCR ribotype B, of which only one (3%) had a clindamycin MIC .256 mg/L. The 14 A 2 B + strains were all PCR ribotype C, and had a range of MICs for clindamycin from 2 to .256 mg/L. Conclusions: The incidence of CDAD in our hospital is relatively low. Isolates remain susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin.",

Toxin A (TcdA) is a potent enterotoxin and thought to cause most of the clinical symptoms due to induced fluid secretion and mucosal damage. 1 Toxin B (TcdB) is approximately 1000 times more cytotoxic than toxin A. The effect of TcdB is thought to depend on initial tissue damage by TcdA, suggesting that both toxins work synergistically. 2 While Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD) has been well described in North America and Europe, there are very little data on the prevalence of CDAD in south-east Asia.",

            "text": "In a recent outbreak in Quebec, hospitals were experiencing 22 cases of CDAD per 1000 admissions, although this decreased to 12.4 per 1000 admissions after infection control measures were implemented. 9 In the absence of an outbreak, the incidence may be very low. For example in a Paris hospital, the annual incidence varied from 0.7-1.2 per 1000 admissions. 10 In the United States, from 1989 to 1992, the reported incidence in four hospitals varied from about 20 per 1000 admission/discharges during an outbreak, to seven per 1000 discharges in the absence of an outbreak. These epidemics were largely caused by clindamycin-resistant strains. 11 US hospital discharges for which CDAD was listed as any diagnosis doubled from 82 000 or 31 per 100 000 population in 1996 to 178 000 or 61 per 100 000 in 2003. This overall rate was several-fold higher in persons .65 years of age (228 cases per 100 000) than in the age group with the next highest rate, 45-64 years (40 cases per 100 000). 12 Our hospital data are similar to those of Sweden, where the incidence of CDAD in a country-wide survey in 1995 varied from 1.0-3.3 cases per 1000 admissions. 13 However, the incidence in terms of bed-days was different (27 per 100 000 bed days in Sweden compared with 53.8 per 100 000 bed days in Singapore). In another Swedish study in 1999-2000 from \u00d6 rebro county, the incidence was similar and varied from 0.4-6.5 per 1000 admissions. The high incidence wards were geriatrics (36 cases per 1000 admissions), infectious disease (19 cases per 1000 admissions) and nephrology (13 cases per 1000 admissions). 14 A later study from a Swedish teaching hospital in 2001 had a slightly higher incidence of 7 cases per 1000 admissions. Like our study, there was a higher incidence in nephrology (37.1 cases per 1000 admissions) and haematology (30.2 cases per 1000 admissions) wards. This is a likely reflection of antimicrobial and chemotherapeutic drug use in these specialties. In contrast to our study, the three most common PCR ribotypes comprised only 30% of hospital associated cases (versus 66% in Singapore) indicating that this was due to endogenous strains rather than hospital spread. 15 It is quite difficult to draw comparisons about the incidence of CDAD, as papers from different countries are often comparing different measures and hospital populations. However, it appears that the incidence in Singapore is at the lower end of the spectrum, although the affected age groups and ward populations at risk are similar. Most CDAD in our study occurred in males and there was up to four-fold difference in incidence between patients representing the three major ethnic groups in Singapore. However, the 95% confidence intervals for the latter were wide and overlapping and our study was not designed to exclude confounding factors like underlying illnesses and principal diagnosis in the different subpopulations.",

This is almost identical to the result (56.7%) obtained by Delm\u00e9e et al. 17 Like Delm\u00e9e, we also used HeLa cells which are considered slightly less sensitive than Vero cells, which may partly explain the low sensitivity.",

However, Delm\u00e9e et al. estimate that the total cost including labour, agar and reagents for toxin detection on colonies does not exceed 10 euros (,AU$16). 17 In our laboratory, culture was not a problem because we have a large dedicated anaerobic section and a virology section to provide cell cultures. However, these resources may not be readily available in all laboratories. A disadvantage is the much longer turnaround time of culture (at least 3 days) compared with direct toxin assays (several minutes). The trade off between sensitivity and timeliness of result will need to be evaluated in each laboratory as sometimes the speed of the toxin assay is negated by the batching of specimens. More studies may need to be performed comparing the culture filtrate ('second-look') toxin assay versus repeating a direct toxin assay on a repeat specimen. It should be noted that culture is the only way to type strains and test their antimicrobial susceptibility.",
