Starting from probably November to December 2019, another Coronavirus entered the arena of human pathogens, to be then defined 2019-nCoV. 1 The outbreak of respiratory illness caused by 2019-nCoV was initially detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. China Republic arranged strong restrictions to limit domestic people circulation. Within days, most European countries and the United States established an unrestricted scientific cooperation to exchange data and information, useful to design a defensive wall against the worldwide spreading of this new epidemic. Spreading is favored by universal access to intercontinental mobility by airplane, and propensity of Chinese people to massively migrate within, but also outside, their subcontinent especially during national holidays.",

Coming to the hottest topic, data from Wuhan show that at an early evaluation, the pediatric population, even in this very-high risk area, appears to be at an unexpectedly low risk to develop the disease. 2 Why may this happen remains unclear. Are children absolutely protected from infection or only from the risk to develop the disease following infection? Formal demonstration of the ability of 2019-nCov to infect a child has been provided by Chan et al. In their report, when screening for 2019-nCov the asymptomatic members of the family of a patient with pneumonia, they documented infection in a child who yet remained asymptomatic. 5 Thus, this first and so far unique case shows that infection of children is possible although apparently extremely rare; furthermore, it was not followed by the development of the respiratory disease at the time of writing.",
