Serotonin (5-HT) and angiotensin (Ang) II are important mediators of the pro-mitotic effect of physical activity. Here, we examine precursor cells in the adult brain of mice lacking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and explore the effect of an acute running stimulus on neurogenesis. ACE2 metabolizes Ang II to Ang-(1-7) and is essential for the intestinal uptake of tryptophan (Trp), the 5-HT precursor. In ACE2-deficient mice, we observed a decrease in brain 5-HT levels and no increase in the number of BrdU-positive cells following exercise. Targeting the Ang II/AT1 axis by blocking the receptor, or experimentally increasing Trp/5-HT levels in the brain of ACE2-deficient mice, did not rescue the running-induced effect. Furthermore, mice lacking the Ang-(1-7) receptor, Mas, presented a normal neurogenic response to exercise. Our results identify ACE2 as a novel factor required for exercise-dependent modulation of adult neurogenesis and essential for 5-HT metabolism.",

Angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a principal regulatory enzyme of the RAS that catalyzes the conversion of Ang II to Ang-(1-7) [9] . In this role, ACE2 controls the transition from Ang II signaling, which is vasoconstrictive and pro-inflammatory to that of Ang-(1-7), which is vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory. Ang II exerts its deleterious effects by binding to the Ang II receptor type 1 3 1 (AT1), and selective AT1 antagonists are used clinically to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The G-protein-coupled receptor Mas has been identified as a functional receptor of Ang-(1-7) [10] . Together with the Ang II receptor type 2 (AT2), the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis represents the \"protective arm\" of the RAS. Besides the well-described role in systemic cardiovascular and metabolic regulations [11, 12] , ACE2 and Mas may be also involved in central effects mediated by a local RAS in the brain [13, 14] . Both components are expressed in the adult brain with particular density in parts of the hippocampus where adult neurogenesis occurs [15] [16] [17] .",

We observed that ACE2 deletion results in an uncoupling of physical activity and neurogenesis. Experimentally elevated Trp levels and blockade of AT1 could not reverse this effect. Loss of Mas instead left the system of running-induced cell proliferation intact. These data indicate that ACE2 is required for exercise-dependent neurogenesis and is an important new modulator of 5-HT metabolism.",

No isolation effects were observed as has been described previously for different mouse strains [5, 27] .

Young-adult ACE2-deficient mice display a lower body weight compared with WT mice (8 weeks old, WT 19.8 \u00b1 0.3 g vs. ACE2 17.3 \u00b1 0.4 g, p < 0.0001). The number of proliferating cells in ACE2-deficient mice 24 h after the first BrdU injection did not differ compared with WT mice (WT 1337 \u00b1 99 cells vs. ACE2 1301 \u00b1 97 cells; Fig. 1b ). These data show that ACE2 is not required for baseline proliferation of precursor cells. We next tested the neurogenic response to physical exercise. While WT animals revealed the typical robust increase in the number of BrdU-positive (BrdU+) cells in the DG (baseline 1337 \u00b1 99 cells vs. running 3107 \u00b1 159 cells, p < 0.001), 1 week of physical exercise did not increase cell proliferation in ACE2-deficient mice (Fig. 1b) . However, we observed that ACE2-deficient mice ran shorter distances during voluntary wheel running for 6 days (WT 59.2 \u00b1 7.5 km vs. ACE2 43.1 \u00b1 4.6 km, p = 0.0012; Fig. 1c ). No difference was seen within both genotypes in the mean distances traveled per night and between day 1 and day 6 (d1/d6, WT 10.8 \u00b1 0.5/9.3 \u00b1 1.1 km, ACE2 7.2 \u00b1 0.8/6.2 \u00b1 1.1 km), or in body weight gain between WT (1.14 \u00b1 0.2 g) and ACE2deficient mice (1.13 \u00b1 0.4 g) over the time course of the experiments. To ensure that the observed reduced running can provoke a neurogenic response, running wheels for an additional WT group were blocked for half of the night to mimic the activity of ACE2-deficient animals. The set of WT mice used for this experiment (WT vs. WT RUN vs. WT RUN1/2 ) matched the body weight of ACE2-deficient mice (7 weeks old, 17.8 \u00b1 0.4 g). Physical exercise led to a strong increase in BrdU numbers in both running groups (WT 1557 \u00b1 80 cells vs. WT RUN 2800 \u00b1 169 cells, p = 0.0022; vs. WT RUN1/2 3094 \u00b1 201 cells, p = 0.0018; Fig. 1d ), although mice with blocked wheels were running significantly less for 6 days (WT RUN 50.3 \u00b1 3.5 km vs. WT RUN1/2 19.9 \u00b1 3.9 km, p = 0.0012; Fig. 1e ).

To evaluate Ang-(1-7) effects in the neurogenic actions of ACE2, we quantified running-induced cell proliferation in the DG of mice deficient in the Ang-(1-7) receptor, Mas (Fig. 3a) . At baseline, 8 weeks old Mas-deficient mice (Mas) exhibited a similar number of BrdU+ cells 24 h following the first injection when compared with WT (WT 1537 \u00b1 87 cells vs. Mas 1612 \u00b1 125 cells; Fig. 3b ). Voluntary wheel running for 6 days led to a robust pro-mitotic effect in both genotypes compared with baseline (WT 2909 \u00b1 160 cells, p < 0.001, and Mas 2911 \u00b1 189 cells, p < 0.001; Fig. 3b ). Running distances observed in WT and Mas animals did not differ between genotypes (WT 55.6 \u00b1 2.1 km vs. Mas 51.5 \u00b1 4.8 km; Fig. 3c ). Examination of the phenotypes of newly generated cells revealed no genotype differences in the distribution of BrdU/GFAP+ type-1 (WT 6.8 \u00b1 0.8% vs. Mas 6.4 \u00b1 1.7%), Sox2+ type-2a (WT 29.6 \u00b1 2.5% vs. Mas 35.3 \u00b1 3.0%) and DCX+ type-2b/3 cells (WT 32.2 \u00b1 3.1% vs. Mas 34.0 \u00b1 2.0%) for Mas-deficient and WT mice (representative images; Fig. 3d, e) . These data demonstrate that Mas-deficiency has no obvious effect on cell proliferation in the adult DG at baseline and following running. The results show that impaired Ang-(1-7) signaling is not responsible for the lack of running-induced neurogenesis in ACE2-deficient mice.",

To restore Trp levels, animals received a diet supplemented with the dipeptide Gly-Trp, which is transported through the gut by ACE2-independent mechanisms and effectively used in previous studies [21] . One week of Gly-Trp-enriched diet (Trp diet) let Trp and 5-HT levels in the blood and brain of ACE2-deficient mice increase. In the brain, the Trp levels increased up to 150% of WT (p < 0.001) and normalized 5-HT to the WT level (Fig. 5b) . Running under Trp diet also elevated Trp levels in the brain of ACE2-deficient mice to WT levels (Fig. 5c ). No significant difference in 5-HT levels was observed between genotypes following physical exercise and under Trp diet. To test whether Trp diet affects runninginduced cell proliferation, the same experimental design was used with Trp diet fed 3 days before and during physical exercise to ACE2-deficient and WT animals.

However, experimentally enhanced Trp and 5-HT concentrations in the brain did not rescue the running-induced effect in ACE2-deficient mice. Targeting the Ang II/AT1 axis by blocking the receptor did also not reverse the findings, and deletion of the receptor for Ang-(1-7) did not phenocopy ACE2 ablation.

Lack of ACE2 led to changes in running performance, and no pro-mitotic effect in the hippocampus was observed. We ruled out that ACE2-deficient mice lack the capacity for exercise due to reduced body weight. In our previous study, Tph2 \u2212/\u2212 mice (which lack the brain 5-HT-synthesizing enzyme [32] ) displayed growth retardation without affecting running performance [5] ; thus, lower body weight of ACE2-deficient mice per se is unlikely to be the reason for reduced physical activity. Furthermore, the pro-mitotic effect of running does not only depend on the distance traveled but the amount of activity/duration [33] . Although running less, ACE2-deficient mice in our study ran continuously every night. As shown for WT mice, long-term voluntary wheel running leads to alterations in muscle strength (e.g., increased muscle mass and skeletal muscle hypertrophy) that was abolished in ACE2-deficient mice [34] . Skeletal muscle releases cathepsin B during longterm treadmill running in monkeys that might affect brain function [35] . Whether acute running in our study leads to differential changes in skeletal muscle between the genotypes and to an altered release of factors influencing adult neurogenesis needs to be determined. However, we did not observe changes in motor behavior per se that might lead to slower running activity. Furthermore, ACE2 deficiency is accompanied by altered glucose homeostasis [36] which may also be implicated in the impaired running-induced neurogenesis. However, Mas-deficient mice show comparable disturbances in cardiac and skeletal muscle physiology [37, 38] and metabolic functions [39] to ACE2-deficient animals and still exhibit normal effects of exercise on cell proliferation in the hippocampus (Fig. 3) . Together with our data on increased cell proliferation after mimicking shorter distances traveled in WT animals, we provide strong evidence that running less does not translate into the absence of runninginduced neurogenic response. The data confirm our hypothesis that ACE2 is required for the exercise-dependent effect.",

            "text": "To define a mechanism around ACE2, we examined the angiotensin peptides and targeted Ang II by blocking AT1, and Ang-(1-7) by deleting Mas. Manipulation of angiotensin peptide levels during running might impact cell proliferation in the DG. Recent studies have shown that physical exercise stimulates levels of circulating Ang II in rats [40, 41] . A pro-mitotic effect was also observed following intravascular Ang II infusion into rats, which was reversed by AT1 blockade with losartan [41] . Our data show that AT1 activation is required for running-induced proliferation. TEL treatment to some extent blocked the pro-mitotic effect of running in WT mice confirming a stimulating role of AT1. However, TEL treatment did not rescue running-induced proliferation in ACE2-deficient mice arguing for AT1-independent mechanisms in this mouse model. Circulating Ang-(1-7) levels are elevated following physical activity [42] . Using Mas-deficient mice, our data reveal the typical neurogenic response to running and thus argue that a lowered synthesis rate of Ang-(1-7), as observed in ACE2-deficient mice [14] , is not responsible for the lack of running effect. Furthermore, we did not observe changes in the phenotype distribution of newly generated cells in this model compared with WT, as was previously reported based on increased numbers of DCX+ cells in the DG of Mas-deficient mice [17] . Besides technical differences in the analysis of neurogenesis (BrdU vs. DCX), the known variation in the neurogenic response between mouse strains (mixed 129/C57BL/6 background in Freund et al. vs. C57BL/6 in our study [43] ) may affect the outcome. Overall, add-on stimuli, such as TEL or Trp diet, did not lead to increased numbers of progenitor cells for ACE2-deficient mice after running at any time. An alternative pathway could be Ang II-mediated stimulation of AT2, which has been shown to contribute to increased neurogenesis induced by heat acclimatization in both the hippocampus and subventricular zone of rats [44] . Furthermore, other peptide substrates of ACE2, such as apelin, dynorphin A, or des-Arg 9 -bradykinin [45] may mediate the effects on running-induced cell proliferation. Future experiments may clarify the suggested molecular mechanisms involved in ACE2-mediated neurogenesis.",

Using Tph2 \u2212/\u2212 mice, we have previously established that 5-HT is required for the pro-mitotic effect of running [5] . Here, we discovered similar results in that permanent depletion of ACE2 did not change baseline neurogenesis, but abolished the effect of running on cell proliferation in the adult hippocampus. However, experimentally enhanced Trp/5-HT levels in the brain did not affect proliferation at baseline nor rescue the neurogenic response to running in ACE2-deficient mice, arguing for a 5-HT-independent phenotype. The beneficial aspect of running [3, 4] was seen in all WT groups. However, increased cell proliferation was attenuated following Trp diet. The mechanism behind this effect of Trp remains elusive, but may involve a dysbalance of AAs in the brain after Trp diet. Yet, cell proliferation at baseline was not affected when fed Trp diet. Alterations in running performance under conditions of changes in 5-HT levels might be due to lack of motivation or early satiation. Both are unlikely, since the running performance pattern showed constant running at night.",
