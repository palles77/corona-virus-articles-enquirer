Although nucleos(t)ide analogs inhibiting viral reverse transcriptase are clinically available as anti-HBV agents, emergence of drug-resistant viruses highlights the need for new anti-HBV agents interfering with other targets. Here we report that cyclosporin A (CsA) can inhibit HBV entry into cultured hepatocytes. The anti-HBV effect of CsA was independent of binding to cyclophilin and calcineurin. Rather, blockade of HBV infection correlated with the ability to inhibit the transporter activity of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). We also found that HBV infection-susceptible cells, differentiated HepaRG cells and primary human hepatocytes expressed NTCP, while nonsusceptible cell lines did not. A series of compounds targeting NTCP could inhibit HBV infection. CsA inhibited the binding between NTCP and large envelope protein in vitro. Evaluation of CsA analogs identified a compound with higher anti-HBV potency, having a median inhibitory concentration <0.2 lM. Conclusion: This study provides a proof of concept for the novel strategy to identify anti-HBV agents by targeting the candidate HBV receptor, NTCP, using CsA as a structural platform.

Currently, clinical treatment for HBV infection includes interferon alpha (IFN-a) and nucleos(t)ide analogs. IFN-a therapy yields long-term clinical benefit in only less than 40% of patients and can cause significant side effects. Nucleos(t)ide analog treatment can suppress HBV replication and is accompanied by substantial biochemical and histological improvement; however, it may select for drug-resistant viruses, which limit the efficacy of long-term treatment. To overcome these problems, the development of new anti-HBV agents targeting a different step of the HBV life cycle is urgently needed.",

Hence, it is important to define alternative molecular targets for anti-HBV agents as well as to identify potential anti-HBV compounds. 3, 4 Myrcludex-B is a peptide mimicking pre-S1, which is crucial for the virus-cell membrane interaction. Pretreatment with this peptide has been shown to prevent virus entry and spread of virus infection. 5, 6 Phenylpropenamide derivatives and heteroarylpyrimidines (HAP) suppressed HBV replication through capsid disassembly. [7] [8] [9] [10] Although the development of the former was discontinued because of significant toxicity, 3 HAP exhibited anti-HBV efficacy in the absence of robust toxicity. 8, 10 Deoxynojirimycin derivatives are iminosugars that inhibit alpha-glucosidases. Although treatment with these compounds suppressed HBV secretion in both cell culture and mouse models, 11, 12 further investigation will be required to assess their anti-HBV efficacy and the specificity to HBV. Thus, it is an attractive strategy to identify a cellular factor that is specifically involved in HBV infection and relevant for the development of anti-HBV agents.",

CsA primarily targets cellular peptidyl prolyl cis/trans-isomerase (PPIase) cyclophilins (CyPs). 13 The resultant CsA/CyP complex subsequently binds to and inhibits calcineurin (CN), a phosphatase that dephosphorylates nuclear factor of activated T cell (NF-AT) to allow nuclear translocation and transactivation of downstream genes. This CN inhibition contributes to the suppression of immune responses. In addition, CsA is known to inhibit the transporter activity of membrane transporters, including the multidrug resistance (MDR) and MDR-related protein (MRP) families. 14 Previously, we demonstrated that CsA and its nonimmunosuppressive derivatives suppress hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, 15, 16 with the anti-HCV activity being mediated by the inhibition of CyPs. [17] [18] [19] Currently, a series of drugs classified as CyP inhibitors are in clinical development for treatment of HCV-infected patients. 20, 21 In this study we report that CsA and its analogs inhibited HBV entry through a CyP-independent mechanism. We established a screening system that can identify small molecules inhibiting HBV entry. Screening in this system revealed that CsA blocked HBV entry. The anti-HBV activity of CsA was not correlated with binding to CyPs and CN. CsA inhibited the transporter activity of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a recently reported candidate for the HBV entry receptor, 22 and interrupted the binding between NTCP and large envelope protein in vitro. Other NTCP inhibitors also blocked HBV infection. Analog testing identified CsA-related compounds with higher anti-HBV potency than CsA. Thus, CsA and NTCP inhibitors can be used as a platform to develop a novel class of anti-HBV agents.",

To identify small molecules inhibiting HBV entry, we pretreated HepaRG cells 27 with compounds for 2 hours, then added a HBV inoculum and continued incubation with compounds for 16 hours (Fig. 1A) . After washing out free HBV and compounds, the cells were cultured for an additional 12 days in the absence of compounds (Fig. 1A) . For robust chemical screening, HBV infection was monitored by the viral envelope protein (HBs) level secreted from the infected cells at 12 days postinfection by ELISA. This assay could identify heparin, an HBV attachment inhibitor, 28, 29 and bafilomycin A1, a v-type H 1 ATPase inhibitor that blocks acidification of vesicles and HBV entry, 30 but not lamivudine, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, 31 as compounds reducing HBs protein level in the medium (Fig. 1B ). In addition, use of an anti-HBs antibody to neutralize viral entry, but not use of an anti-FLAG antibody, reduced viral protein secreted from the HBV-infected cells (Fig. 1B) . Thus, this system is likely to evaluate the effect of compounds on the early phase of the HBV life cycle, including attachment and entry, but not effects on HBV replication. A chemical screen with this system revealed that CsA reduced HBs secretion from HBV-infected cells ( (Fig. 1F ). The anti-HBV effect of CsA was also observed on HBV infection of PHHs in the absence of PEG8000 (Fig. S1B) , indicating that the effect of CsA did not depend on PEG8000, which was normally included in the HBV infection experiments.

CsA slightly reduced the amount of attached HBV DNA, although the effect was not statistically significant ( Fig. 2D-a) . In contrast, CsA caused a significant reduction of HBV DNA in the internalization assay ( Fig. 2D-b) .

Thus, CsA appears to primarily block the entry step including internalization. To examine whether CsA targeted HBV particles or host cells, we preincubated HBV with CsA and then purified the CsA from the HBV inoculum, followed by measurement of the HBV infectivity using HepaRG cells (Fig. 2F) . Preincubation with CsA did not affect HBV infectivity, in contrast to the antagonizing effect of heparin to HBV particles (Fig. 2F) , suggesting that CsA did not affect HBV particles but rather targeted host cells.",

In contrast, CyPA and CyPB were expressed in all of these cell lines, irrespective of infection susceptibility. Intriguingly, we found that the inhibition of NTCP transporter activity correlated with anti-HBV entry activity (Figs.  5A, 4A,B) . These results suggest the possibility that compounds targeting NTCP have the potential to block HBV infection. To test this prediction, we treated Hep-aRG cells with compounds known to inhibit NTCP, including ursodeoxycholate, cholic acid, propranolol, progesterone, and bosentan 35, 36 to investigate the effect on HBV entry using the protocol in Fig. 1A . As shown in Fig. 5D , these compounds inhibited HBV infection. Thus, inhibition of NTCP blocked HBV infection. We also showed that HepG2 cells overexpressing NTCP were susceptible to HBV infection (Fig. 5E) , as reported recently. 22 Treatment with CsA also reduced HBs and HBe secretion when these cells were infected with HBV (Fig. 5E) , suggesting that CsA inhibited NTCPmediated HBV infection.",

To test this possibility, we established an AlphaScreen assay to evaluate LHBs-NTCP binding in vitro as described in the Materials and Methods. In vitro synthesized NTCP and LHBs were at least partially functional, as NTCP bound to its substrate TCA (Fig.  S3A) and LHBs could neutralize HBV infection into HepaRG cells (Fig. S3B) . As shown in Fig. 5F , incubation of recombinant NTCP with LHBs but not middle (MHBs) and small envelope protein (SHBs) produced a significant AlphaScreen signal ( Fig. 5F-a, left) indicative of a direct protein-protein interaction. In contrast to NTCP, recombinant GST or other nonrelevant proteins, LCK and FYN, 37 did not produce a binding signal when incubated with LHBs ( Fig. 5F-a) , suggesting that our AlphaScreen assay produced a specific signal for the interaction of NTCP with LHBs. Consistent with the report that the pre-S1 region of LHBs was important for the binding to NTCP, 22 the signal was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of pre-S1 lipopeptide HBVpreS/2-48 myr , 5 (Fig. 5F-b) but not of an inactive mutant of pre-S1 (Fig. S3C) , indicating a competition of pre-S1 with LHBs for NTCP binding. In this assay, CsA as well as FK506 and a CsA derivative, SCYX1454139 (see the next section), were shown to reduce the signal for LHBs-NTCP binding in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 5F-c,d,e) .

As shown in Fig. 6A , SCYX618806 reduced HBs secretion after HBV infection, while a related analog SCYX1774198 did not have a significant anti-HBV effect (Fig. 6A,C) . Additional analogs, SCYX827830 and SCYX1454139, had significant anti-HBV activities (Fig. 6A,C) . Alisporivir (Debio 025), an anti-HCV drug candidate, 38 also decreased HBV infection to the equivalent level to CsA (Fig. 6B) . Figure 6D shows a dose-dependent reduction of HBs secretion by treatment with SCYX618806, SCYX827830, and SCYX1454139, all of which had more potent anti-HBV activities than CsA (compare Fig. 6D with Fig.  2A) . These results indicate that anti-HBV activity is not disrupted by at least some changes to the 3glycine, 4-leucine, and 8-alanine residues of CsA, although additional analogs will need to be evaluated for a full understanding of the structure-activity relationships. Notably, SCYX618806 and alisporivir bear modifications on the 4-leucine residue of the CsA backbone that prevent CN binding and immunosuppressive activity (Table S1 ), further confirming that anti-HBV activity does not require immunosuppressive activity. Notably, SCYX1454139 showed the strongest anti-HBV entry activity among 50 CsA derivatives examined (data not shown and Fig. 6E ). The median inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) for anti-HBV activity as well as CC 50 s determined by an MTT-based cell viability assay are shown in Fig. 6E . The IC 50 and CC 50 of SCYX1454139 were 0.17 6 0.02 and >10 lM, respectively, a profile superior to that of CsA (IC 50 and CC 50 of 1.17 6 0.22 and >10 lM, respectively). Inhibition of HBV infection by treatment with SCYX1454139 was also observed in PHHs, in which also the anti-HBV effect of SCYX1454139 was more remarkable than that of CsA (Fig. 6F) .

In this study, we showed that CsA inhibited the entry of HBV but in an apparent CyP-independent manner.

First, the experimental system mainly used in this study (Fig. 1A) is likely to evaluate the early phase of HBV infection but not HBV replication. Second, the suppression of HBV replication by CsA reported previously was mediated by blocking the mitochondrial permeability transition pore possibly through binding to mitochondrial CyPD. 47, 48 The anti-HBV activity shown in this study, however, had no correlation with binding to CyPs, suggesting that the inhibition of HBV infection in HepaRG cells and PHHs is not from the result of suppression of HBV replication. Rather, CsA inhibited NTCP transporter activity and disrupted the binding between NTCP and LHBs in vitro. Moreover, inhibition of HBV infection could be observed by treatment with other compounds having the capacity to inhibit NTCP. These results suggest that targeting NTCP blocks HBV infection.",

            "text": "The current anti-HBV agents are mainly comprised of nucleos(t)ide analogs and IFNs. Development of anti-HBV agents targeting different molecules is greatly needed for achieving improved treatment of HBV infection, especially to combat drug-resistant virus. HBV cell entry mechanisms have been poorly defined. At the initial stage, HBV attaches to target cells with low affinity through binding involving cellular factors including heparan sulfate proteoglycans. 28, 29 For the subsequent entry mechanism, it has recently been reported that NTCP is essential for HBV-specific entry. 22 Although the precise mechanism for entry and internalization is as yet incompletely understood, interference with this step has emerged as an attractive approach for development of novel therapeutics. For example, Gripon et al. 5 demonstrated that a peptide mimicking the pre-S1 region of large envelope protein prevented HBV infection in a mouse model. These results suggest that inhibition of virus cell entry could be an effective strategy for preventing HBV infection to achieve clinical outcomes such as for postexposure prophylaxis, blockage of vertical transmission, and prevention of HBV recurrence after liver transplantation. Given that HBV reactivation generally occurs under immunosuppressive conditions, 49, 50 it is uncertain whether clinically relevant doses of CsA or FK506 could be helpful in preventing HBV reactivation after liver transplantation. It remains also unknown in general whether entry inhibitors could be effective in eliminating chronic HBV infection. Future studies should evaluate whether inhibition of HBV entry by CsA or its derivatives can reduce persistent HBV infection, especially in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogs or interferons. In this study, we obtained nonimmunosuppressive CsA derivatives that could inhibit HBV entry (Fig. 6) . Moreover, a small-scale analog analysis identified a CsA derivative exhibiting more potent inhibition of HBV infection, with an IC 50 of 0.1-0.2 lM (Fig.  6 ). This IC 50 is equivalent to the anti-HCV replication activities of alisporivir or SCY-635 (0.22 lM and 0.08 lM, respectively), drugs which have been shown to reduce HCV viral load in infected patients during clinical trials. 38 Further analog analysis using CsA as a platform may identify more potent anti-HBV compounds.",

(B) HBV DNA in core particles was detected by southern blot analysis of DNA extracts from HepAD38 cells treated for 6 days with or without tetracycline 0.5 lg/mL and lamivudine 1 lM. (C) Upper scheme indicates the treatment schedule of HepaRG cells with compounds and HBV. HepaRG cells were infected with HBV for 16 hours. After washing out the input virus, cells were cultured in the absence of compounds for 8 days. The cells were then cultured with compounds (lamivudine 1 lM, entecavir 1 lM, IFN-a 100 IU/mL, or heparin 25 U/mL) for 4 days and recovered for detection of HBV DNA. Black and dotted boxes indicate the periods with and without treatment, respectively. Lower graph shows the quantified relative HBV DNA level in cells treated according to the above scheme. (D) Upper scheme shows the experimental procedure for examining the attached and internalized HBV. (a) The cells were pretreated with compounds (heparin 25 U/mL, lamivudine 1 lM, or CsA 4 lM) at 4 C for 2 hours and then treated together with HBV at 4 C for 3 hours to allow HBV attachment to the cells. After washing out the free virus, cell surface HBV DNA was extracted and quantified by real-time PCR. (b) After attachment of HBV at 4 C for 3 hours and the following wash, the cells were cultured in the presence or absence of compounds at 37 C for 16 hours to allow the cells to internalize bound HBV. The cells were then trypsinized and extensively washed prior to quantifying the cellular HBV DNA. The lower graphs show the level of HBV DNA attached to the cells (a) and internalized inside the cells (b). \"Background\" in (b) indicates the signal from cells incubated at 4 C, instead of 37 C, for 16 hours after washing out the virus in (b), which shows the background signal level of the assay. (E) The upper scheme shows the procedure for the time of addition experiment. Compounds (CsA 4 lM, anti-HBs antibody 10 lg/mL, or heparin 25 U/mL) were applied beginning 2 hours prior to HBV infection (a), beginning during HBV infection (b), or beginning immediately after HBV infection (c) until 24 hours postinfection. HBs and HBe protein secretion were measured at 12 days postinfection.Middle and lower graphs indicate HBs and HBe secretion, respectively, from the cells treated according to the above scheme. (F) Preincubation of HBV with compounds. HBV was preincubated with the indicated compounds for 30 minutes at 37 C. Compounds were then removed by ultrafiltration. The recovered compound-treated HBV was used to infect HepaRG cells (16 hours incubation), and HBV infection was monitored with HBs antigen secreted into the medium at 12 days postinfection. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, N.S., not significant.",
