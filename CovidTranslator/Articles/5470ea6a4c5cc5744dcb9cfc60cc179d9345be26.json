Several general principles are applicable when developing and assessing the efficacy of a microbiological monitoring program, irrespective of the type of caging used for rodent housing. First and foremost, the monitoring program must specifically target the infectious agents of concern. In particular, there should be consideration of the route and duration of transmission of the infectious agents, the probability that the agents will be found, and the likelihood that the agents will cause disease or affect research results. Second, the monitoring program should make the most efficient use of personnel and resources. Finally, the outcome of a successful monitoring program should aid research, not hinder it, and should result in animals that are sufficiently pathogen free for research and should facilitate exchange of animals between institutions.",

The three types of caging systems commonly used are open-top cages, static isolator cages, and individually ventilated cages (IVCs). The type of housing used affects the ease with which infectious agents can be spread between rodents housed in separate cages. Rodents housed in open cages and serviced in the open have the highest risk of transmitting infectious agents from cage to cage via aerosols and fomites. This is one reason why this type of housing is being eliminated in many facilities.",

            "text": "IVCs differ from static isolator cages in several ways. Each cage receives a supply of HEPA filtered air at a rate of between 30 and 120 air changes per hour (ACH). This results in lower temperature and humidity as well as lower concentrations of ammonia and carbon dioxide than in static isolator cages 3 . Some IVC systems balance the air supply with the air exhaust system, thus permitting control of differential pressure at the cage level. Thus each cage, theoretically at least, is its own biocontainment zone. An alternative approach in some IVC systems is to seal the cages to achieve biocontainment (instead of balancing differential pressure). This approach has, however, the obvious disadvantage of being potentially lethal in the event of cage ventilation failure 4, 5 . Rodents housed in IVCs have the lowest risk of cage-to-cage spread of infection [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] (J. Schmidt, personal communication). Transmission between animals housed in IVC systems generally occurs as a result of dissemination during husbandry procedures or experimental manipulations by investigators, thus justifying the use of ventilated cage change stations for such activities. Nevertheless, it is essential to exercise great care to ensure against transmission by fomites on hands or equipment, such as watering valves, particularly when active infections are present 11, 12 .",

There are three types of sentinel animals. First, contact sentinels (i.e., mice housed in the same cage as the colony mice to be monitored) are highly reliable at detecting infectious agents transmitted by all routes (air, feces, urine, wounds, contact, etc.). Second, soiled-bedding sentinels (i.e., mice housed on soiled bedding that has been removed from several cages of colony mice) are most effective at detecting agents that are transmitted in feces or urine. Third, exhaust air sentinels (i.e., mice that are exposed to rack exhaust air) are effective at detecting agents that are transmitted in respiratory excretions. Lipman and Homberger 13 provide an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of the three types of sentinels. Finally, direct detection of infectious agents present within the environment of a colony is feasible by swabbing such surfaces as cage and cage racks, by taking appropriate samples from rack exhaust air, and so on.",

The advantages of serological assays are that they are inexpensive and can provide a historical picture of which agents are present in the colony (i.e., at any time after a mouse becomes seropositive, antibodies to the rel-evant agent can be detected). The primary disadvantage of serological assays is that mice infected with an agent may not become seropositive until 2 or more weeks after the infection's initiation. Therefore, in the midst of an outbreak, many mice may become infected and may potentially be transmitting virus to other mice, yet may still be seronegative. Additionally, immunocompromised mice, especially those with B-cell deficiencies, may produce few or no antibodies in response to an infection.",

            "text": "Recently, molecular methods have augmented our arsenal of testing methods. Molecular methods, in particular PCR and RT-PCR, detect the nucleic acids present within a bacteria or virus. In general, these methods are highly sensitive and rapid, and can be very effective means to determine which animals are infected with a particular agent. Molecular methods are particularly useful during outbreaks, when it is essential to determine rapidly (within a few hours) the location of infected mice within a rack, so as to develop a strategy for containing the spread of the agent. The limitations of molecular methods are that they are relatively expensive, they can yield both false negative and false positive results, their high sensitivity makes them prone to cross-contamination, and many substances found in blood, feces, and other animal tissues can function Methods such as exposing sentinels to soiled bedding, as used traditionally with mice housed in static isolator cages, also require reassessment for their applicability in IVC systems. Moreover, we should add to our monitoring approach new methods specifically designed to exploit IVC system characteristics by the sampling of air exhausted from the IVC system. There are two ways of monitoring the exhausted air, either from individual cages or from the whole IVC rack. Small gauze filters placed on the cage exhaust opening, on the exhaust opening from a zone of the rack (e.g., a row or column of cages), or on the exhaust manifold of the entire rack can permit periodic monitoring of the effluent air. After removal from the rack, molecular PCR-based methods can detect infectious agents on the filters. Additionally, there can be continuous monitoring of exhaust air from the IVC rack (or a selected zone of the rack) that is achieved by testing of sentinels housed in a specially designed cage (BioScreen system; BioZone Inc., Fort Mill, SC, and BioZone Ltd., Margate, UK) that receives as its air supply a portion of the mixed exhaust air from several cages on the rack, before HEPA filtration (Fig. 1) . The effectiveness of such a system is clearly dependent on the uniformity of ventilation of all cages on the rack so as to be confident that a low incidence of infection will be represented in the exhaust air without regard to the location on the rack of the infected animals 12 .",

This method seems highly reliable on first consideration, but it presents significant drawbacks. If the animals are properly screened, considering that each cage is essentially a self-contained unit, then it is by far the least cost-effective method, because it requires the largest investment of mice, staff, and testing reagents. Moreover, the age, genotype, and experimental use of the animals may interfere with the applica- as inhibitors of the enzymes used in these assays, causing false negative results. Finally, the nucleic acids detected may be present in a noninfectious form of the agent, such as in inactivated material present on the surface of cages or change stations. Detection of bacteria usually follows culture of fecal, cecal, nasopharyngeal, or other tissue samples on specialized agar plates. Specific identification of pathogenic bacteria after culture usually involves a combination of enzymatic and fermentation tests.

The first influence is the route(s) by which the agent is shed from the animal ( Table 1 ). Agents that are transmitted only through animal-animal contact, such as mites, are very difficult to detect in mice housed in an IVC system. It is possible to detect these agents directly in colony animals or using contact sentinels. One can effectively detect agents that are transmitted via the fecal-oral route, such as mouse parvovirus (MPV), using contact sentinels, sentinels exposed to soiled bedding, or molecular testing of feces from colony animals, but exhaust air sentinels are not effective at detecting these 12 . In contrast, the use of contact sentinels, exhaust air sentinels, or molecular testing of cage surfaces is effective in detecting agents that are shed in respiratory secretions, such as Sendai virus, but sentinels exposed to soiled bedding are ineffective at detecting these 12 . The methods used to sample the cage or rack surfaces for air-borne infectious agents (cage wipe material or protocols, filter material, or placement location) may influence the effectiveness of detecting the agent of interest. For example, our lab detected Sendai virus RNA on the cages of experimentally infected mice for 2 weeks using calcium alginate swabs wet with saline, whereas another group was able to detect Sendai virus RNA on the cages of experimentally infected mice for only 3 days using alcohol wipes 12, 14 .",

The less humid cage environment present in the IVC system could result in the dehydration and inactivation of many infectious agents. This effect, together with the dilution of organisms in the exhaust air by the higher ventilation rate, could lead to decreased transmission of agents to colony and sentinel mice. The decreased intercage spread of an infectious agent means that infections are sporadic and confined to just a few cages at a time, and it is therefore essential to use an adequate sample size when monitoring mice housed in IVC systems. Several studies have shown that the high airflow achieved in IVC systems results in lower ammonia levels than those seen in static isolator cages at 5-7 days after cage change 3,16-18 . The lower ammonia levels measured in IVCs are probably the direct result of lower relative humidity, because high humidity has been linked to proliferation of urease-positive bacteria that can convert urea to ammonia 19 . Furthermore, the type of bedding used in IVC systems can affect the rate of ammonia accumulation, because some bedding types may contain endogenous ureases 20 . The frequency of cage change generally depends on the time required for intracage ammonia concentrations to rise to a level considered irritating to the mucous membranes of husbandry personnel (generally >25 p.p.m.) 21 . Because ammonia levels rise more quickly in static isolator cages, it is generally necessary to change static isolator cages at least once a week, whereas mice housed in IVC systems may need changing only once every 2 weeks. Less frequent cage changing decreases demands on personnel time, decreases the quantity of bedding used, increases cage longevity, and may decrease pup mortality 22 , but it can also decrease the efficacy of soiled-bedding monitoring. If husbandry personnel add soiled bedding to sentinel cages only during routine biweekly cage changes, then this reduces the number of times that soiled bedding will be added to the sentinel cage in the IVC system as compared with static isolators, and agents pre-competent mice, with shedding of virus for \u223c5 days, can be very difficult. Direct tests for the agent in the animal or the environment must occur during the short window of shedding and therefore are quite unreliable at detecting a low-level infection within a colony. Detection of EDIM using serology and sentinels exposed to soiled bedding has the limitation that the timing of the soiled-bedding transfer must coincide with the short period of shedding to be effective. In IVC systems, a biweekly cage-changing schedule, with biweekly addition of soiled bedding to sentinel cages, has the disadvantage that the bedding transferred may or may not contain infectious virus. For agents that cause acute infections, methods that monitor the mice continuously over an extended period, such as seroconversion of colony mice, contact sentinels, exhaust air sentinels, or long-term placement of gauze filters in the exhaust air stream, are most effective. Frequent monitoring, using sentinels exposed to soiled bedding or shortterm placement of gauze filters in the exhaust air stream, can also be effective. Periodic monitoring methods, such as sentinels exposed to soiled bedding, and continuous monitoring methods, such as exhaust air sentinels, are both likely to be effective at detecting agents that cause chronic or persistent infections.",

Agents, such as MPV, that cause a chronic infection with low-level fecal shedding, can be difficult to detect. Detection of these agents necessitates testing an adequate sample size. A sample size that is too small or a monitoring protocol that samples a nonrepresentative group of cages can result in sporadic detection of the agent within a colony. For example, in a recent study, mice that received a single dose of soiled bedding from a group of cages in which 20% of the cages housed MPVinfected mice seroconverted, whereas those that received several doses of soiled bedding from a group of cages in which only 5% of the cages housed MPV-infected mice did not seroconvert 12 .

This means following a strict protocol to avoid bias by regularly sampling all cages on the rack, and one should also consider supplemental sampling of soiled bedding between cage changes.

Agents such as MPV are present at low concentrations in exhaust air. Recently, we reported that MPV DNA was not detectable on filters placed on the rack exhaust filter for 24 h, but MPV DNA was detectable on filters placed on the rack exhaust filter for 2 weeks 12 . The positioning of filters within the IVC rack can also influence the chance that an agent will be detected. For example, MPV, MHV, and Sendai virus were all detectable on filters placed on the lids of cages housing infected animals for 24 h at 6 days after inoculation, but only MHV and Sendai virus were detectable on filters placed on the rack exhaust filter for 24 h at 6 days after inoculation 12 . This indicates that the closer to the source of the infection, where the infectious-agent concentration in the exhaust air is highest, the greater the likelihood of detecting it. It will be necessary to determine for each IVC system the optimal positioning of test filters and the time required to accumulate adequate particulates, which serve as fomites to transport infectious agents through the air, and should consider the ventilation pattern of the system. Theoretically, any location within the exhaust system of the IVC rack that a small (1 cm 2 ) filter can be temporarily placed can serve as a test site. The type of bedding used in IVC cages could affect the rate of particulate generation and accumulation on filters and therefore could affect air-testing efficacy. Aspen chip bedding has been found to be substantially less dusty than wood fiber or straw pelleted bedding 23 . Theoretically, the greater the amount of dust generated from bedding, on which agents can be carried through the air, the greater the chance of detecting the agent on a filter.",

When infections are present in only a small number of cages on an IVC rack, as is often the case, the reliability of exhaust air monitoring, whether using gauze filters placed on the rack prefilter or using exhaust air sentinels, is likely to be highly dependent on the uniformity of exhaust airflow within the rack. Nonuniform airflow resulting in large variations in exhaust airflow from individual cages may be a cause of inaccurate or unreliable sampling of cages housing infected mice seen in some studies (B. Tiemann, personal communication). Furthermore, some IVC systems have a single manifold that is used for supply air only, and exhaust air simply escapes from the cage into the room. In such IVC systems, it may be impossible to appropriately sample exhaust air either by using gauze filters or with exhaust air sentinels.",

Monitoring strategies and approaches to diagnostic sample collection are confounded regularly by the convergence of innovative husbandry refinements, new developments in a wide array of caging systems, evolving pathogens, and novel rodent genotypes. In this environment of constant change, and often in the face of relatively meager financial resources for assessment of these mitigating influences, the validation of monitoring approaches has proved to be a challenge. Consequently, we recommend a multifaceted approach to monitoring for infectious agents in IVC systems. Each monitoring program should consider both infectious agent-related and equipment-related variables. The routes of transmission for the infectious agents to be monitored, the duration and infectiousload shed, and the stability of the agent in the environment should all inform the decision as to which approach to monitoring is appropriate. Likewise, the frequency of testing should specifically target the battery of agents to be tested and the type of caging used. It is also essential to understand and consider airflow rates and uni-formity of airflow in each type of IVC system. Until techniques and technology, still to be developed, simplify the monitoring process, a fully integrated program of microbiological monitoring should make use of a sensible combination of soiledbedding sentinels, contact sentinels, and, where possible, exhaust air monitoring. Even a broad sentinel-based monitoring program, however, is unlikely to be fully reliable and completely sound. Consequently, the most comprehensive monitoring program should also include health evaluations of colony rodents that present as clinical cases.",
