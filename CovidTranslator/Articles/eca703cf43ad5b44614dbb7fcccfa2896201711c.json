Alex Lake, one of the journal's associate editors has provided an excellent overview highlighting principles that physicians should consider. 5 In this rapidly evolving scenario, the latest advice page remains an essential resource: www.gov.uk/government/ collections/wuhan-novel-coronavirus As ever, alongside these reviews and original submissions we have our regular CME section (this month, on renal medicine curated by our outstanding demitting nephrology associate editor, Mike Almond) as well as our insight-provoking clinical cases and lessons of the month. And we feature another of our popular Opinion pieces -this time on training in clinical examination. 6 We hope you find plenty of content to enjoy and share. \u25a0 References 1 Mitchell JW , Kallis C , Dixon PA , Grainger R , Marson AG .

            "text": "Another national, indeed global, health crisis -much more acute -is the ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) . The RCP, and its journals, are able to respond in nimble fashion with an update on the evolving outbreak, its clinical manifestations and the priorities for the immediate future. Alex Lake, one of the journal's associate editors has provided an excellent overview highlighting principles that physicians should consider. 5 In this rapidly evolving scenario, the latest advice page remains an essential resource: www.gov.uk/government/ collections/wuhan-novel-coronavirus As ever, alongside these reviews and original submissions we have our regular CME section (this month, on renal medicine curated by our outstanding demitting nephrology associate editor, Mike Almond) as well as our insight-provoking clinical cases and lessons of the month. And we feature another of our popular Opinion pieces -this time on training in clinical examination. 6 We hope you find plenty of content to enjoy and share. \u25a0",
