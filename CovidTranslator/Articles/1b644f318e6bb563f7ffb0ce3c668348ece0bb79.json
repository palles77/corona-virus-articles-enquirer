One integrated review identified approximately 160 different types of visualization methods, and the preferred type of visualization heavily depends on a specific discipline or work setting (Lengler & Eppler, 2007) . For example, flow charts are frequently used in computer science and engineering, and the three-dimensional (3D) format is commonly used in architecture. In epidemiology, visualization has been used since the 19th century for conveying population-level statistics, communicating new insights and hypotheses, and assisting decision makers. John Snow's visualization of the cholera outbreak demonstrated that the vehicle for spread of the disease was water rather than air (Parkes, 2013) , and Florence Nightingale used visualizations to show that more deaths resulted from contamination in hospitals than from the war (Small, 1998) .",

While it is quite feasible for visualization techniques to be incorporated into an electronic health record for improving patient care, it is challenging given the fact that clinicians work under time-pressured environments in hospitals. Visualizations integrated in an electronic health record may not be used effectively among clinicians if visualizations are not evaluated. Further, each clinician has varying visual literacy to interpret the visualizations (Lengler & Eppler, 2007; Matsumoto, Uto, Muranaga, & Kumamoto, 2013) . One solution to these barriers is to apply a participatory approach to design user-centric visualizations (Carroll et al., 2014) , which can help the audience reconstruct and integrate the knowledge and ultimately motivate them to meaningful action (Lengler & Eppler, 2007) . In order to overcome the clinicians' barrier of lack of time when they are provided with infection rate reports, user-centric usability evaluation of the infection rate reports such as measuring time of the cognitive process and cognitive burdens is crucial.",

During the concurrent think-aloud (CTA), the data collector encouraged participants to express what they felt and thought while they were viewing visualization (e.g., \"this [visualization] is much better than putting numbers [in the infection report]\"). Once they finished viewing the set of visualizations, the data collector encouraged the participants to articulate their reflections, thoughts, and feelings aloud (retrospective thinkaloud [RTA]; Boren & Ramey, 2000; Dumas & Redish, 1999) . While CTA assesses the spontaneous thought process of human working memory, RTA investigates the thought process relying on a participant's recall memory. CTA slows down the normal viewing process and interferes with the speed of normal thought process, affecting reliability (Hertzum, Hansen, & Andersen, 2009; Jong & Schellens, 2000) .

The eye tracking software, Tobii Pro StudioTM (http://www.tobii.com/en/eye-tracking-research/global/products/software/tobii-studioanalysis-software/), produces a quantified dataset to export and further analyze using other statistical software (millisecond time units in rows and different measures quantifying eye movement characteristics in columns). Similar to other popular usability evaluation software such as Morae (https://www.techsmith.com/morae.html), Tobii Studio allows voice and screen video recording and provides frames and tools for an investigator to transcribe, comment, code, mark, and organize users' verbal and nonverbal responses. Unlike subjective self-reported data, an eye-tracking technique measures users' attention and response in an objective way by tracking where they look (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v = WCmfVuyImC0).

The eye tracker device collects the spatial position of each eyeball to detect where a participant looks, and the software stores the collected data as numbers, heat maps, and sequence diagrams. In order to calculate the amount of users' attention, the eye tracking measures the frequency and duration of moments when the eye is stable to acquire visual information (fixation and dwell time). Higher frequency and duration of fixation and larger pupil size indicate good attention to a visual stimuli (Wedel & Pieters, 2000) . Fixation (I-VT filter, velocity thresholds 30 degrees/seconds) and dwell time, which is known to be reliable indicators of a person's attention, was used in this study (Fox, Krugman, Fletcher, & Fischer, 1998; Pieters & Wedel, 2007) .",

Each design in Figures S2 through S8 includes different content suggested by the nurses who worked on the unit (user-centric approach). The designs nurses on the unit requested included visualizations of infection in a room where they were in charge, infection in their own unit, and infection of specific microorganisms. The infographics convey content of increasing complexity based on three scenarios, including body site infection rates in a single room (infection in a room), body site infection rates in a unit with multiple rooms (infection in a unit), and infection rates with specific microorganisms over a period of 6 years (infection in a unit for multiple years). Further, the designs contain different graphical components, including dimension (2D and 3D) and variations in pictograms (recognizable and unrecognizable objects to the naked eye). attention measured by objective eye tracker, and preference verbalized by users) when processing information regarding hospital infection rate visualizations. The data collector showed the set of visualizations to the participants repeating three rounds with the following three steps: (a) comprehension, (b) comparison, and (c) reflection section ( Figures S9) . First, the participants were asked to complete the comprehension test questions with three scenarios. In the comparison step, the data collector repeatedly showed the same set of visualizations provided during the first step, and instructed participants to freely and naturally view the designs. While the participants were viewing freely, they were encouraged to verbalize their preference between traditional line graphs and infographics and to compare them. Unlike displaying a single visualization at a time in the Step 1 comprehension test, two or three visualization designs aligned side by side were simultaneously displayed per screen during the Step 2 comparison section to assist participants in comparing the designs. A blank page was provided before and after visualization stimulus to wipe out memory and to reduce eye fatigue during the comparison step. In order to complement qualitative selfreport responses, pupil movement during the comprehension and comparison section was concurrently collected using eye-tracking techniques.",

The study findings of the users' positive attitudes and immediate understanding of the visualizations support the feasibility of integrating infection visualization into electronic health records when this study applied a user-centric design approach. Innovative visualizations conveying infection transmission designed by their peers may be positively adopted by nurses who work under time-pressured environments in a hospital to integrate hospital infection knowledge and ultimately motivate them to be mindful of the need for prevention efforts.",

The preference of line graphs may be explained by their routine use in patient records (Lengler & Eppler, 2007) . Regardless of the platform of display, whether paper or electronic records, line graphs have been heavily used for decades to represent patient vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate (Tague, Maeder, & Nguyen, 2010) . The study finding implies that the line graphs are a suitable choice for simple data representation in infection transmission due to their familiarity, clarity, and ease of reading.",

This study found contradictory results between objective and subjective data in Scenarios 1 and 3. While most participants preferred the line graphs during the interview, they paid more attention to the infographics (seen in red in the heat maps from eye tracking). There are multiple reasons for being highly attentive on the infographics. The attention was not because of the difficulty of processing the information of the infographics in Scenario 1 as it took significantly less time to comprehend information of the infographics than the line graphs. This implies that objective eye-tracking methods may provide a deeper understanding of human visualization interaction behavior than a conventional interview or think-aloud method. A single method to evaluate usability of visualization should be avoided. Nurses, who are the main user, have rarely been included in usability evaluation of electronic health records. This study introduced a method to collect nurses' voices objectively and subjectively in usability evaluation of electronic health records.",
