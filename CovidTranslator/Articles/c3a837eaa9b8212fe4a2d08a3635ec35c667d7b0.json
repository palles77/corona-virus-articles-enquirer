Huang and colleagues reported that the first 41 patients of COVID-19 exhibited fever, cough, myalgia, and/or fatigue as common symptoms, 29% of whom had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and six of whom died (15%) 2 . The typical findings from chest computed tomographies (CTs) were bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation 2 . At earlier times during the COVID-19 outbreak, patients with COVID-19 were more likely to report exposure to food from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. With the epidemic gradually growing, it is now clear that human-to-human transmission has been prevalent 3 Importantly, when assessing COVID-19, it is noteworthy that influenza viruses share common etiologies and occur in the same season. Recently, global influenza associated with respiratory mortality is occurring at a higher frequency than what has been previously reported 5 . From September 2019 through the present day, there have been more than 170,000 patients with influenza in the United States, more than half of whom have been infected with the influenza A (H1N1) virus. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia induced by influenza is 6.8% 6 . During the H1N1 global epidemic in 2009, Jain et al. found that 5% of patients with H1N1 influenza were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) and 7% died 7 .",

In our study, we found that the severity of respiratory failure was not equal between COVID-19 and H1N1 patients. We found that PaO 2 /FiO 2 levels in COVID-19 patients were higher than those in H1N1 patients, such that respiratory support in COVID-19 patients was initially via non-invasive methods and ultimately yielded higher failure rates. The EOLIA trial 22 provided information about the posterior probability of a mortality benefit for patients with acute respiratory failure 23 , especially in terms of reporting the success of the application of ECMO in ARDS patients with influenza 24 . We speculate that ECMO may also have potential in treating COVID-19 patients. However, the rapid growth of cases and lack of medical resources and medical staff have limited standardized respiratory support in accordance with related guidelines.",

Although H1N1 patients in this study exhibited significantly lower oxygenation than that of COVID-19 patients, there was no difference in the mortality rate between the two groups. From the adjusted mortality analysis, we found H1N1 patients had a significantly worse prognosis than COVID-19 patients. All of the included COVID-19 cases in the present study were at the early stage of this epidemic. The rapidly growing cases of unknown diseases, inadequate responses, insufficient medical staff, and lack of medical supplies have adversely affected the treatments and prognoses of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, as a novel respiratory infectious disease, the relatively higher mortality rate of COVID-19 cases is to be expected. From the experiences gained from treating early COVID-19 patients, subsequent cases may benefit from better and more standard therapies, including specific medical treatments and respiratory support.",

First, this was a retrospective study that included data from two independent single-center cohorts, which may have resulted in unavoidable bias. Second, the conditions of H1N1 patients were more severe than those of the COVID-19 cohort, which may have led to statistical disequilibrium. Third, there were 35.6% of the COVID-19 patients still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission that meaning the mortality rate presented in COVID-19 is likely an underestimate of the real overall hospital mortality rate. At last, the data from the H1N1 cohort originated from a three-year span, whereas the data from the COVID-19 cohort originated from only a one-month span, which may have also affected our present results.",
