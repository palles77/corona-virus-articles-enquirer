Paramyxovirions contain a helical nucleocapsid (NC) core composed of the minus-strand RNA genome (15-16 kb) and ca . 2000 copies of the nucleocapsid protein NP. In addition, ca . 200 copies of the phosphoprotein P and 50 copies of the large protein L are bound to this structure . The genome is expressed via complementary monocistronic mRNAs and is replicated via a fulllength complementary strand, the antigenome . Reconstitution experiments with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) have shown that polymerase activity in vitro requires both the P and the L proteins as well as the RNA-NP core (Hamaguchi et al., 1983) . The P and L proteins are also found as a complex, both on and off the NC core (Hamaguchi et al., 1983 ; Portner et at, 1988) . By analogy to the rhabdovirus VSV, whose L gene and that of the paramyxoviruses are thought to share a common ancestor (Poch et at, 1989) , L is the actual polymerase, and capping and poly(A) formation of mRNAs are thought to map to this protein as well (Banerjee, 1987) . The VSV counterpart to the paramyxovirus P protein is NS, which has recently been referred to as P (Herman, 1986 ; Bilsel et at, 1990) , as NS (nonstructural) is a misnomer . The paramyxovirus and rhabdovirus P proteins are not related by sequence homology or size, but are organized similarly . Both are acidic proteins, whose N terminal halts are also highly phosphorylated (Bell and Prevec, 1985 ; Vidal et at, 1988) and poorly conserved among related viruses . The C-termini are better conserved and contain the site(s) by which this protein binds to the RNA-NP core (Emerson and Schubert, 1987 ; Gill et aL, 1986 ; Kolakofsky et al., 1990 ; Ryan and Portner, 1990) .",

Those of the morbilliviruses measles (Bellini at al., 1985) and CDV (Barrett et at, 1985) , and the parainfluenza viruses SEN (Giorgi et at, 1983 ; Shioda et aL, 1983) and parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3) (Galinski at al., 1986 ; Luk at al., 1986 ; Sakai et al., 1987 ; Spriggs and Collins, 1986) , which are 568-602 residues long, also contain a 200 as ORF (called C) overlapping the N-terminus of P. The P and C ORFs are expressed by ribosomal choice . Those of the other parainfluenza viruses (SV5 (Thomas et at, 1988) , mumps virus (Elliott et al., 1990 ; Paterson and Lamb, 1990 ; Takeuchi et al., 1990) , NDV (Sato at at, 1987 ; McGiness et al., 1988 ), PIV2 (Ohgimoto et al., 1990 Southern et al., 1990) , and PIV4 (Kondo etat, 1990) ) are only 392-398 as in length and lack the C ORF . However, all paramyxovirus P genes except respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) and PIV1 (see Discussion) also contain an ORF called V and are transcribed into at least two slightly different mRNAs, one for the P and one for the V protein (Fig . 1) . In all cases one mRNA is an exact copy of the gene, whereas the other is modified by the addition of either one or two Gs, within a short run of Gs (Thomas at al., 1988 ; Cattaneo at at, 1989 ; Vidal et at, 1990a) . The G additions are thought to take place by the viral polymerase reiteratively copying a template C residue during mRNA synthesis, by a stuttering mechanism (Vidal et at, 1990b ; Pelet et al., 1991) . These insertions alter the reading frame in the middle of the gene and allow ribosomes to translate the alternate ORF downstream (Fig . 1) .",

As shown in Fig . 3 , the majority of the P protein, as expected, was found in the bottom fraction where the NCs have sedimented . The selection of the L protein as well from this fraction is presumably due to a P-L complex resistant to the detergent conditions used . The V protein, in contrast, was found only in the top two fractions . In this experiment the extract was prepared with the nonionic detergent NP-40 in normal salt, but identical results were obtained with the lysolecithin protocol, or when the extract was prepared by dounce homogenization without detergent, and in low salt . Moreover, similar results were obtained when the gradients were examined by Western blotting rather than precipitation (not shown) . This latter result appears to rule out the possibility that the absence of V in the NC fraction was due to the masking of the anti-V epitope on the NC with another protein .",

The conserved Cys residues of V are reminiscent of other transcription factors such as the HIV tat protein and zinc-finger proteins, which interact with nucleic acids and modify transcription .

In contrast to P, we have been unable to find V in virions or intracellular NCs that are transcriptionally active . This is consistent with previous data . Ryan et al. (1991) have found that only two blocks of P, both in the C-terminal half, are neccessary and sufficient for P binding to NCs in vitro. The absence of both of these binding sites in V would explain the lack of a stable association of V with NCs and why it is not selectively packaged in virions . There are, however, as many as 200 copies of P per NC, and our data cannot exclude that a few copies of V are present . The reason for so many P proteins on each NC is enigmatic, and it remains possible that unlike P, only very small amounts of V are required for RNA synthesis . However, the only anti-V-specific antibody available so far has no effect on RNA synthesis in vitro. We have thus been unable to provide evidence that, like P, V is required for RNA synthesis . In this respect, the recently determined sequence of the PIV1 P gene (Matsuoka et ai., 1991) is germane . PIV1 and SEN are the most closely related pair of paramyxoviruses (Matsuoka at aL, 1991) , except for bovine and human PIV3 .

The SEN/ PIV1 alignment, in contrast, is unambiguous and shows that the protein is divided into N-and C-terminal parts, with a hypervariable region in between (Fig . 1) . One measure of the relatedness of PIV1 and SEN is that PIV1 can replicate a SEN DI genome . Remarkably, whereas the P and C proteins of SEN and PIV1 are well conserved (residues 75-204 of C are 8896 identical), the V ORF in PIV1 is interrupted by nine stop codons, and there is no semblance of an editing site in the vicinity . Barring the possibility that the V function is expressed from an area of the PIV1 genome which has not as yet been elucidated, this would indicate that V is not required for RNA synthesis . However, even though PIV1 (and RSV) do not appear to code for a V protein, all the other paramyxoviruses do so within the P gene, and the V-specific sequences are the most highly conserved of the three P gene ORFs among these viruses . This conservation, when V is expressed, suggests that it does play an important role in virus replication . We have recently developed an in vivo system in which DI genome replication is dependent on cloned viral genes expressed from plasmids (manuscript in preparation) . In this system, P expression is essential for RNA synthesis, whereas V expression is not . Moreover, coexpression of V with P inhibits RNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner . These studies suggest that V is a negative regulator of RNA synthesis . If so, one can more easily reconcile the absence of V in PIV1 .",

(1990) have recently found that a nonstructural protein (NS2) is not essential for coronavirus replication in cell culture, and Huang et al., (1990) have shown that the nonstructural proteins of influenza virus (NS1 and NS2) are not essential for the replication of an artificial genome .",

Samples were immunoprecipitated with either anti-V or mAbs to the P and NP proteins as indicated below . Proteins were analyzed on a 12 .5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel . (A) lanes 1-3, precipitations of uninfected cell extracts ; lanes 4-6, precipitations of SEN-infected cell extracts . (B) lanes 1 and 2, wild-type w-infected cell extracts ; lane 3, extract prepared from a w-recombinant expressing the V protein ; lanes 4 and 5, extracts prepared from w-recombinants expressing the P protein .",
