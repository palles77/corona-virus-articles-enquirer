It is now possible to identify many viral respiratory pathogens directly from clinical specimens in <1 hr. Rapid antigen detection promises to be of the most value in the identification of respiratory viruses 1] for which antiviral therapy is available, 2J which can be prevented by employing isolation precautions, chemoprophylaxis, andlor immunization, 3) whose presence usually is associated with acute respiratory disease, not just asymptomatic colonization, and 4) which ordinarily are not associated with concomitant bacterial infection, and thus, whose early detection may allow withholding or withdrawing antibiotics. Based on these considerations, the relative usefulness of rapid viral antigen detection of commonly encountered respiratory pathogens will be discussed. In addition, the role of rapid viral detection in diagnosis of respiratory infections in high risk versus otherwise healthy individuals will be explored.",

It rarely was of direct benefit in the management of patients with acute disease because the patients usually were either well or dead before the virus could be identified. Technological advances of the past few years have allowed the transfer of sensitive and specific rapid viral antigen detection methods (Table 1 ) from sophisticated basic science laboratories to routine diagnostic facilities. It is possible to identify many respiratory viruses directly from clinical samples within 1 day. The development of such rapid viral diagnostic tests is particularly important now that antiviral therapy is becoming available.",

            "text": "Viral antigen detection has several advantages over standard culture and serologic techniques. The most obvious is the availability of the test results early enough so that the patient's outcome may be improved by appropriate changes in therapy. Because antigen detection does not necessarily require viable organisms, specimen handling requirements are not as stringent as for virus cultures. This broadens the availability of viral diagnostic tests to health care providers who do not have optimal handling, storage, or transport facilities. Antigen detection methods also permit identification of some viruses that are difficult or impossible to cultivate in the laboratory and, occasionally, identification of viruses later in the course of disease, after they are no longer cultivatable. A major advantage of antigen detection over serologic diagnosis of viral respiratory infections is that no convalescent sample is required. In addition, not all patients, particularly those who are at the highest risk of serious respiratory disease (e.g.. infants and compromised hosts), are able to mount an antibody response during viral infection (Chanock et al., 1963 : Vargosko et al.. 1965 : Craft et al., 1979 .",

Repeated infection with RSV is common, but symptoms are milder and usually involve only the upper respiratory tract in older children and adults. Recently, ribavirin has been demonstrated to be effective for RSV disease. Ribavirin (113-D ribofuranosyl-l,2.4-triazole-3-carboxamide) is a nucleoside that resembles guanosine (Hall et al., 1983a) . It is a potent inhibitor of virus replication in vitro. Its spectrum of activity includes RSV, influenza A and B, and parainfluenza viruses. The most effective route of administration is aerosol which is well-tolerated with no significant toxicity. Ribavirin administered by the oral route has marginal, if any, effectiveness (Cohen et al., 1976 : Togo et al., 1976 . Ribavirin (Virazole, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) has been licensed in the United States for RSV infections. In RSV lower respiratory tract infections in infants ribavirin therapy led to significant improvement in arterial oxygen saturation, cough, retractions, rales, and lethargy (Hall et al., 1983; Taber et al., 1983) . Ribavirin aerosol treatment also has been demonstrated to be effective in RSV (Hall et al., 1983a) , influenza A (Knight et al., 1981; Wilson et al., 1984) and influenza B infections in adults. Ribavirin shows potential activity against parainfluenza virus, but no controlled clinical studies have been performed.",

Such high rates of spread can be explained, at least in part, by the fact that 92%-100% of infected infants still shed large amounts of virus 7 days into the infection (Hall et al., 1975) .

Benefits of restricting antibiotic therapy include decreased incidence of superinfection with fungi and resistant bacteria, as well as a reduction in acute side effects and in sensitization predisposing to future allergic reactions. Rational decisions about limiting antibiotic therapy, however, can only be made based on knowledge of the patterns of colonization and disease caused by individual viruses. One must know if a virus is present, whether it is usually a pathogen, or whether it is just associated with asymptomatic colonization. Data vary with the means of data collection but, generally, RSV (Hall, 1981a) , parainfluenza virus (Hall, 1981) , and influenza viruses (Cherry, 1973) are found in <1% of normal individuals, and rhinoviruses are found in only -3% (Cherry 1973) . In contrast, because adenovirus may be shed for up to several months after an episode of infection, it has been found in respiratory and fecal samples from <1% to >10% of the population (Van der Veen and Dijkman, 1962; Cherry 1973), and Elveback et al. (1966) reported that the presence of adenovirus was associated with disease in only 49% of individuals. Thus, if RSV, parainfluenza, influenza, or rhinovirus were found in the nasopharynx of a patient with respiratory symptoms, it is highly likely that it is pathogenic. The presence of adenovirus, however, does not necessarily implicate it as an etiologic agent.",

Combined bacterial-viral infections have been documented for all viruses, but are seen much more commonly with some viruses than others. Respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus infections seldom are accompanied by bacterial superinfections (Elderkin et al., 1965; Hall, 1981; Hall, 1981a) . On the other hand, influenza virus infection is regularly followed by secondary bacterial pneumonia (Cherry 1973; Douglas and Betts, 1985) . Serious bacterial infections also have been reported with adenovirus infections, particularly in military recruits (Ellenbogen et al., 1974; Spencer and Cherry, 1981) . Thus, a decision to limit antibiotic use is simpler when RSV or parainfluenza viruses, than when influenza or adenoviruses are identified. It is important, however, to remember that in some patients, particularly those who are very seriously ill and those who are in high risk groups, that bacterial or fungal superinfections or polymicrobial infections may be indistinguishable from viral disease alone and, thus, it may not be possible to omit antimicrobial therapy for other organisms simply because a virus has been found.",

            "text": "Another way in which viral antigen detection may aid in management of acute respiratory infections is by enabling the physician to give the patient some idea of the prognosis for the illness. One of the main reasons a patient sees a physician other than for treatment is to find out what to expect from the illness. Giving a specific viral etiology, rather than diagnosing a \"viral infection,\" serves to enhance the physician's credibility and reassure the patient, especially if antibiotics are not prescribed. Table 4 summarizes some of the factors that affect the value of antigen detection for the five most comm6nly encountered respiratory viruses. First, rapid diagnosis is more important for treatable than nontreatable viruses. Second, the availability of preventative measures such as chemoprophylaxis with amantadine for influenza A, or vaccines for influenza A and B viruses and, in military recruits, for adenoviruses types 4 and 7, helps determine the value of antigen detection for prevention of disease. Whether or not the virus found usually is pathogenic or associated with bacterial superinfection is important. Also, at the present time, rapid viral antigen detection is more important in the diagnosis of severe disease than in such benign conditions as the common cold because early intervention is likely to have a more pronounced effect on morbidity and mortality. Patients who are in high risk groups for developing severe viral respiratory infections such as those listed in Table 5 should be the primary candidates for viral antigen detection testing. It should be noted that the size of all of the groups most likely to benefit from early diagnosis of respiratory infections is continually growing due to improved medical care and the resultant increased survival rates. The present value of antigen detection for viral respiratory infections in normal hosts is limited to management of those with severe disease. However, in the future, if effective antiviral therapy becomes available for routine outpatient use, it is possible that rapid diagnosis will permit early treatment of even mild conditions. Another important potential benefit from rapid diagnosis and early therapy of viral respiratory infections in normal individuals as well as in those at high risk, is a decrease in the incidence of chronic lung disease following lower respiratory infections. It is estimated that a large percentage of chronic lung disease in the United States is caused or exacerbated, by viral lower respiratory infection (Kattan et al., 1977; Laraya-Cuasay, 1978; Monto and Ross, 1978; James et al., 1979; Krasinski, 1985) .",

How-ever, even with extensive education campaigns to update clinicians on the scope of respiratory viral disease and the indications for ordering viral antigen detection tests, these tests, particularly those employing monoclonal antibodies or nucleic acid hybridization, could potentially be so specific: as to be of little practical use. Steps being taken to ensure that the spectrum of antigen detection is not too narrow include employing more than one monoclonal antibody to detect a given virus (Routledge et al.. 1985) , using monoclonal antibodies in combination with polyclonal antibodies, and developing monoclonal antibodies capable of reacting with a broad range of antigens (Gerhard et al., 1978 : Yolken, 1982 . The most effective approach to clinical diagnosis will probably prove to be the use of screening panels to test for several of the most common respiratory viruses at once.",

First, despite an enormous amount of effort on the parts of countless investigators, there is still no test available that can reliably distinguish between viral and bacterial respiratory infections. Current efforts to help make this distinction include applying some of the same methods employed for viral antigen detection to the detection of substances such as interferon or specific products of viral infection in clinical specimens (Flowers and Scott, 1985) . Second, it may be possible to adapt antigen detection technology for use in vivo, perhaps using monoclonal antibodies like radionuclides are used in gallium and technetium scanning. This may permit determination of whether or not a given virus is related to the ongoing disease process. For instance, finding adenovirus antigen in the lung, not just the nasopharnyx, of a patient with pneumonia, would provide good evidence that the virus was contributing to the disease process.",

It has the potential to aid in improving morbidity and mortality rates from acute viral respiratory tract disease by permitting earlier institution of antiviral therapy. It also promises to help simplify patient management and to be an important tool to help prevent the spread of viral respiratory infections. In addition, by providing a diagnosis while the physician is still confronted with an acutely ill patient, it will help educate physicians as to the nature of disease caused by specific viruses, and thus, help create the framework for more rational use of antibiotics and antiviral agents. Rapid diagnostic tests also will help teach patients more about viral illness, thus making it easier for them to understand and accept their medical care.",
