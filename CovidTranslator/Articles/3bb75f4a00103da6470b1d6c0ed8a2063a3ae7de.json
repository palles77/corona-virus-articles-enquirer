Because more than 4 trillion bacteria have colonized each human, particularly at the mucosal and skin surfaces, the task of preventing pathogen invasion is not trivial. In more than half a million people in North America each year, this system fails and severe sepsis ensues, killing approximately one-third of these people. Therefore, understanding the behavior of the immune system in response to pathogens, particularly the role of neutrophils, is essential. There is much urgency in this regard, as antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli are on the rise, and viruses (such as the SARS corona virus and H5N1 and H1N1 influenza viruses) that make the host more susceptible to secondary infections are also becoming more prominent. Tweaking host immunity may be a way to fight these emerging pathogens.",

Whether the neutrophil can discriminate between a sterile injury and an infection is not clear, but the molecular mechanisms mediating neutrophil recruitment can be quite variable. Ultimately, to perform their functions, neutrophils need to know where to go. Therefore, efficient neutrophil guidance through the vasculature and into the affected tissue site is crucial and is normally governed by chemotactic gradients. During systemic infection, this system is altered, as the highest concentrations of chemokines and other chemotactic agents are found in plasma.",

However, recently, other explanations have been put forth that suggest that sequestration of neutrophils in lungs and liver is beneficial to host survival. New and somewhat unorthodox ways by which neutrophils may fight bacterial infections in the blood have been described. As one example, neutrophils have been shown to expel their DNA to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to ensnare bacteria before dying. Interactions between platelets and neutrophils are essential for this process to occur in the vasculature.",

            "text": "Here we focus on how neutrophils have a key regulatory role in vascular inflammation. Recent studies using advanced imaging techniques have yielded new insights into the mechanisms by which neutrophils contribute to defense against bacterial infections and also against sterile injury. In these settings, neutrophils are recruited by various mechanisms depending on the situation. We also describe how these processes may be disrupted in systemic infections, with a particular emphasis on mouse models of sepsis. Neutrophils are often immobilized in the lungs and liver during systemic infections, and this immobilization may be a mechanism through which bacteria can evade the innate immune response or allow neutrophils to form neutrophil extracellular traps that trap and kill bacteria in blood. The platelet is also an important player in sepsis, and we describe how it collaborates with neutrophils in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Localized tissue infections are thought to activate sentinel cells, which include dendritic cells, macrophages, mast cells, endothelial cells and perhaps all parenchymal cells, inducing the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the infected tissue. In addition, monocytes crawling along the lumen of blood vessels may infiltrate tissues early in infection to then recruit neutrophils 1 . The upregulation of adhesion molecules, such as selectins, on endothelium is essential to initiate neutrophil recruitment. P-selectin, stored in Weibel-Palade bodies within resting endothelial cells, and E-selectin, which is synthesized de novo, are translocated to the apical cell membrane where they transiently bind ligands on neutrophils, including P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), E-selectin ligand-1 (ESL-1), CD44 and other glycosylated ligands (Fig. 1) . Transient interactions between selectins and their ligands on neutrophils result in neutrophil tethering and rolling, which are the first steps of the leukocyte recruitment cascade 2,3 .",

Teleologically, because endothelial cells are elongated in the direction of flow, perpendicular crawling allows a neutrophil to find an endothelial junction in the shortest period of time. This inherent response to shear might be important for rapid transmigration, as neutrophils have been shown to preferentially transmigrate through junctions 5-11 unless crawling was specifically inhibited 5 . In CD11b-deficient mice, neutrophils did not crawl within the vasculature, and, consequently, transcellular transmigration through endothelial cells predominated 5 . Endothelial cells are very active and responsive during transmigration and form docking structures (endothelial projections) 12-14 that, in vivo, resulted in domes surrounding the entire neutrophil [15] [16] [17] . Endothelial membrane proteins, including PECAM-1, ESAM-1 and CD99, aid neutrophil emigration, and additional adhesive molecules help neutrophils move across the basement membrane through areas with low expression of laminin, collagen and nidogen-2 (ref. 18) . Reverse migration back into the vessel is prevented by endothelial JAM-C 11, 19 .",

            "text": "How do chemokine signals get established in flowing blood? Early work proposed that proinflammatory molecules such as plateletactivating factor were embedded in the membrane of activated endothelium and functioned in a juxtacrine manner to activate and polarize neutrophils 23 . Evidence is now emerging that chemokines also form gradients within the vascular compartment. Experiments in which a chemokine source was placed on one side of a blood vessel showed that the crawling neutrophils were directed to emigrate from that side of the vessel and that heparan sulfate was necessary for this process 24 . The heparan sulfate residues on the surface of endothelium prevent dissolution of the chemokine gradients into the blood and provide localized directional cues for crawling neutrophils 24 . These observations were made using CXCL1 and CXCL2 chemokines, but it is notable that different chemokines bind with different affinities to heparan sulfate 25, 26 , so whether all chemokines can establish these heptotactic gradients remains unclear. r e v i e w Numerous chemoattractants can be released to form gradients during a bacterial infection, partly from the bacteria themselves or from complement fragments emanating from the bacteria but also from nearby activated macrophages and endothelial cells. Neutrophils have been shown to respond to such guidance signals in a hierarchical manner, preferring 'end-target' chemoattractant factors such as bacterial products (for example, N-formyl-methionine-leucinephenylalanine (fMLP)) and C5a over 'intermediate' chemokines such as . This preference raised the possibility that separate signaling pathways were activated in neutrophils in response to fMLP and IL-8. Notably, both fMLP and IL-8 activated the same pathway by activating the class I isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which phosphorylates the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-3, 4-bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) at the leading edge of the neutrophil (Fig. 2) . At the same time, the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is localized to the sides and back of the crawling cell, thereby converting PIP3 back to PIP2 in areas of the cell away from the leading edge 28 . It is worth mentioning that there is a body of work that suggests that SHIP rather than PTEN is the important phosphatase in this process 29 . This mechanism is thought to allow the neutrophil to recognize and amplify shallow gradients of only a few molecules along its length to know that it must move in the direction of PIP3. In opposing gradients, PTEN and PIP2 surround the entire cell circumference (Fig. 2c) , and no gradient is recognized. However, if the same pathway is activated by all chemoattractants and PIP2 surrounds the entire cell, then how does a neutrophil ever detect a gradient? A number of groups have shown that fMLP but not IL-8 also activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Fig. 2b) 30, 31 , and that the fMLP-induced p38 MAPK allowed the neutrophil to respond to the bacterial product ( Fig. 2c) 32 . Additional molecules that contribute to chemoattractant signaling in migrating cells ranging from Dictyostelium to neutrophils have been described recently, for example, PLA2 (ref. 33) , cGMP 34 and DOCK2/plus phosphatidic acid 35 , but whether they have redundant or distinct functions and how they fit into the hierarchical nature of neutrophil chemotaxis remains unclear.",

When one considers that a neutrophil adheres to the endothelium after being activated by endothelially produced and apically sequestered IL-8, unless a second chemoattractant is released from the affected tissue, it is difficult to understand why neutrophils would move out of the vasculature and away from the vessel. Once they have emigrated, neutrophils need to migrate toward the bacterial focus or the dying cells without being distracted by what would then be an opposing IL-8 gradient coming from the vasculature. Receptor internalization of IL-8, allowing a second chemoattractant to dominate in a sequential manner, could occur 36 . Alternatively, a hierarchical response may take place in which fMLP and other end-target chemoattractants inhibit the IL-8 signal 30 . Recently, an in vivo experiment showed that neutrophils in sinusoidal vessels initially crawled along an MIP-2 gradient but then ignored this signal and followed a new gradient of fMLP receptor ligands laid over the MIP-2 gradient, thus gaining access to a precise tissue site 37 (Fig. 3) . Therefore, growing evidence indicates that neutrophil recruitment in vivo results from the release of multiple chemoattractants and that synergistic and opposing effects of the involved signaling molecules are likely to govern neutrophil recruitment into the afflicted tissues.",

            "text": "The highly regulated mechanisms that control neutrophils during chemotaxis are altered in systemic infection and are perhaps disrupted in mouse models of endotoxemia and sepsis in which systemic infection is presumed to occur. As a corollary, neutrophil migration defects have consistently been reported in septic individuals 38 . Sepsis is clinically defined by the presence of infection plus some of the following: fever, tachypnea, edema and increased or decreased white blood cell counts, high serum concentrations of chemokines and C-reactive protein, and hemodynamic alterations. When multiple organs begin to fail, this leads to severe sepsis 39 . Severe sepsis has one of the highest mortality rates of any disease state. Most importantly, anyone of any age is susceptible to sepsis (although the very young and very old are r e v i e w at the highest risk), and any delay in the immune response is likely to increase mortality, making rapid neutrophil recruitment a key endogenous host defense mechanism. Indeed, neutropenic individuals are highly susceptible to sepsis 40 . Despite the clear need for effective neutrophil function, overexuberant neutrophils can potentially injure 'bystander' tissues that are not part of the infected site. In fact, for many years, neutrophils have been a therapeutic target in sepsis. Total elimination of neutrophils would lead to death, but altering or modifying their actions may have potential clinical benefits. During endotoxemia and sepsis in humans and in experimental models, the whole chemotactic process may be disrupted, as the highest concentrations of chemokines and other chemotactic agents are found circulating in the plasma, and they activate the endothelium as well as neutrophils within blood vessels. In addition, the uncontrolled exposure of neutrophils to plasma chemokines results in downregulation of chemokine receptors in individuals with severe sepsis 41 as well as downregulation of CD11b in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice 42 , which further impairs chemotaxis and results in insufficient leukocyte recruitment to the source of infection. Furthermore, molecules such as LPS activate p38 MAPK, the key signaling pathway in fMLP-induced chemotaxis, through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), thus disrupting this chemotactic process.",

In fact, LPS downregulates CXCR2 on human and mouse neutrophils, thereby inhibiting chemotaxis toward IL-8 in humans and toward KC and MIP-2 in mice 44 . This downregulation is prevented by interleukin-33 (IL-33) through inhibition of receptor internalization 44 . Lipoteichoic acid, a component of Gram-negative cell walls and a TLR2 ligand, has been shown to cause downregulation of CXCR2, which would reduce neutrophil chemotaxis 45 . It is clear that bacterial products that activate TLRs may disrupt neutrophil chemotaxis. These data are consistent with the improved bacterial localization and clearance observed in mice that express TLRs only on endothelium and not on neutrophils or other immune cells 46 . In wild-type mice, TLRs on macrophages and other immune cells systemically release many chemokines and cytokines that may distract neutrophils and prevent them from locating bacteria 46 . In addition, circulating activated neutrophils become rigid and can be trapped within the small capillaries of the lung and in liver sinusoids and thereby are prevented from finding bacteria in compartments like the peritoneum, from which the bacteria may be emanating. Finally, certain bacterial proteases have been shown to cleave and inactivate CXC chemokines, thereby impeding the chemotaxis of neutrophils to the source of infection, which decreases bacterial clearance and increases systemic dissemination 47 .",

Nitric oxide (NO) is known to have antiadhesive properties that are mediated by downregulating endothelial adhesion molecules 49, 50 , and the induction of vast amounts of NO through inducible NO synthase could also reduce neutrophil chemotaxis 38, 51 . Moreover, therapeutically administered inhaled NO given to septic individuals with pulmonary hypertension could dislodge neutrophils from lungs, which might be beneficial but could also inhibit their chemotaxis to the necessary sites. There are many unanswered questions about the role of NO in sepsis, but general inhibition of NO may actually harm septic individuals 52 , although specific inhibition of inducible NO synthase could perhaps be of benefit.

However, it is possible that all these changes in neutrophils may actually be an attempt to help the host rather than simply a dysregulation. How would a crawling, emigrating neutrophil help eradicate a pathogen in blood? Perhaps neutrophil sequestration in the lungs and liver has an important survival benefit, as we discuss later in this review. r e v i e w Although mouse models have been used to observe these sepsisrelated phenomena, the human data are often less clear. There are notable differences between experimental and clinical sepsis in terms of both the concentrations of bacteria and the bacterial components in circulation and disease progression. Rodents are highly resistant to infections as compared to humans, and the LPS doses used to induce sepsis in mice (typically 0.5-25 mg per kg of body weight) are 1,000-10,000 times higher than those that have been determined to induce severe sepsis in humans. Furthermore, organ failure, which is a major and crucial component of sepsis syndrome in humans, cannot be readily studied in mice that have received high doses of LPS or bacteria because they die before developing these secondary complications. Therefore, the results from models such as cecal ligation and puncture in mice, although more variable, may better reflect the human condition. Even though elevated levels of chemokines, cytokines and many other proinflammatory molecules as well as severe chemotactic defects have all been reported in individuals with severe sepsis 38, 41 , the importance of many of the mechanisms discussed here remain to be confirmed in humans.",

Aside from potentially killing the host by hyperreactive immunity, many bacteria and viruses cause cell death and cell lysis, which lead to the release of multiple molecules associated with sterile injury. Moreover, as hypotension develops during traumatic or septic shock, tissue ischemia caused by hypoperfusion progresses. This ischemia is followed by reperfusion during aggressive volume resuscitation or rapid blood transfusion, which are procedures used to treat hypotension. Reperfusion injury as a form of sterile injury has been studied for more than 30 years, and a role for neutrophils and their oxidants and proteases has clearly been established 58 . Depletion of neutrophils, or blockade of neutrophil responses, is effective at reducing pathology not only in ischemia and reperfusion 59 but also in trauma, drug-induced hepatotoxicity and other modes of sterile injury 60, 61 .",

            "text": "Injury that causes cell lysis in vivo releases many proinflammatory damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), also called alarmins or danger signals. These are host components released or generated after tissue injury that have inherent proinflammatory activity and thereby alert the innate immune system. A number of comprehensive reviews covering the identities and functions of individual danger signals have recently been published 62, 63 . DAMPs may be proteolytically or oxidatively modified extracellular molecules (for example, digested hyaluronan or precipitated uric acid crystals) or intracellular substances that are actively secreted in response to cell stress (for example, high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1)) or passively released when the cell membrane integrity is compromised (for example, ATP) 64 . DAMPs and pathogen-associated molecular patterns function similarly, both stimulating pattern recognition receptors such as TLRs or NOD-like receptors (NLRs) [62] [63] [64] . The NLRs comprise a family of 22 proteins that are mostly cytoplasmic and that recognize host-derived 'danger'-associated molecules. Their activation leads to the assembly of complexes of high molecular mass called inflammasomes that induce the generation of active caspase-1 and the production of mature IL-1\u03b2. The discovery that the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome can be activated by host-derived particulate matter such as uric acid crystals or ATP has led to its implication in a number of inflammatory diseases 63 . Non-pattern-recognition receptors including receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), CD44 and CD91 can also contribute to the onset of inflammation in several models of sterile injury [65] [66] [67] . Despite much DAMP diversity and organ and/or insult specificity, many of these pathways converge on IL-1. IL-1 acts as a central orchestrator of inflammation and cell recruitment through nuclear factor-\u03baB, p38 and other signaling pathways, which then lead to the formation of chemoattractant gradients. Although many of these DAMPs may indirectly recruit neutrophils, none functions as a true chemoattractant for neutrophil recruitment.",

Figure 3a and Supplementary Video 1 show that following thermal injury, many neutrophils enter the injury site within a few hours. Although the injury was sterile, inhibition of the fMLP receptor (Fig. 3b) , which is normally associated with responses to bacterial products, was the most efficient way of inhibiting the neutrophils 37 . Hauser and his colleagues 68 showed that neutrophils crawled toward injured mitochondria and that this movement could also be abrogated by fMLP receptor inhibitors. These observations may be explained by the fact that mitochondria originate from ancient bacteria that have become endosymbionts inside the cells of multicellular organisms and that formylated peptides are synthesized from their mitochondrial genomes, suggesting that neutrophils respond to mitochondria in a similar way as they do to bacteria. It is unclear whether neutrophils can distinguish between dead cells and bacteria, whether dead cells unleash the same neutrophil-killing mechanisms as bacteria and whether this response is ultimately beneficial for the host. There is clear overlap between infection and sterile injury in a condition like sepsis. Mitochondrial injury is often observed in sepsis, and inhibition of mitochondrial injury reduces pathology in models of sepsis 69 . Although this result initially seems counterintuitive, inhibition of formylated peptide receptors may therefore be a potential therapeutic route in profound bacterial infections.",

Superimposing a multitude of infectious stimuli on top of this injury makes things far more complex. In experiments that attempted to address some of these issues, a filter containing fMLP was placed on the liver surface, and all neutrophils crawled using CD11b through the liver sinusoids toward this site 42 . In the presence of LPS, the neutrophils adhered in liver sinusoids using CD44 rather than integrins and did not crawl toward fMLP. This change from neutrophil chemotaxis to adhesion was caused by an LPS-mediated downregulation of CD11b on neutrophils through an IL-10 (interleukin 10)-related mechanism, and removal of IL-10 restored the ability of neutrophils to crawl toward fMLP, even in the presence of LPS. Thus, IL-10 is crucial in this mechanism, is greatly elevated in sepsis and is deemed to be responsible for the delayed immunosuppressive phase that follows the initial potent inflammatory phase in this condition 70, 71 (Box 1) . In a mouse model of sepsis induced by Escherichia coli (which expresses both LPS and fMLP), neutrophil recruitment to the liver was CD44 dependent and CD11b independent, and no neutrophil crawling was observed in the liver, showing that LPS overrode the fMLP signal 42 . A key question is whether this recruitment and adhesion of neutrophils in the liver is a mechanism that allows bacteria to evade the host immune response or, rather, is a beneficial response of the host; this benefit might be from NET-mediated trapping of bacteria, a process further discussed below.",

Most studies have focused on how neutrophil recruitment at this stage r e v i e w is turned off, with molecules such as resolvins taking center stage 72 . However, neutrophils may also contribute to tissue restitution and angiogenesis. Neutrophils produce and store proangiogenic molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) 73 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) 74 within their granules. VEGF is a key player in blood vessel formation and has a direct chemotactic effect on endothelial cells. The proangiogenic function of MMP-9 is attributed to its ability to release VEGF and other growth factors bound to the extracellular matrix and to digest the extracellular matrix to pave the way for new vessels. The neutrophils are the only cells in the body that can release MMP-9 free of its endogenous inhibitor, TIMP, and are therefore capable of delivering highly active MMP-9 to angiogenic sites 74 . The proangiogenic capacity of neutrophils has been shown in a corneal injury model, where the number of infiltrated neutrophils positively correlated with angiogenesis and VEGF levels 75 . Neutrophil depletion markedly impaired the release of VEGF and tissue healing in this model. Furthermore, another study showed that isolated pancreatic islets transplanted to muscle did not revascularize in neutropenic mice, whereas intra-islet vasculature was restored after transplantation to wild-type mice, showing that recruited neutrophils are important in the initiation of angiogenesis 76 . Outside the focus of this review, but worth mentioning, is the growing evidence that neutrophils may also contribute to cancer through their effects on angiogenesis 77, 78 . A final important point is that neutrophils have been purported to recruit monocytes that may help to remove dead and dying neutrophils but that might also assist in angiogenesis and restitution 79 .",

Under static in vitro conditions, neutrophils can effectively chase after and phagocytose bacteria, but under in vivo flow conditions in blood, this is expected to be a highly inefficient process. However, neutrophils seem to have adapted additional mechanisms for fighting bacteria. Neutrophils have been shown to release their DNA in a net-like fashion in the presence of various bacteria 80 to create traps called NETs. These NETs are covered in proteases (including elastase) and other antimicrobial molecules (such as histones), and these toxic molecules may contribute to host cell injury. However, similar in vivo observations of NETs have yet to be published, perhaps because of difficulties in imaging these events in blood.",

In separate studies, eosinophils and neutrophils were found to catapult their DNA out of the cell into the extracellular space, but the DNA source was non-nuclear and, instead, the DNA originated from the mitochondria 82, 83 . However, most other groups have not reported a role for mitochondrial DNA and have documented the presence of histones on the NETs, suggesting a nuclear source for the DNA. In addition to their direct antimicrobial effects, there is also evidence that histones may have a regulatory role during NET formation, as the process of NET formation starts with histone hypercitrullination and decondensation of the associated nuclear chromatin 84 . During NET formation induced by LPS, IL-8, fMLP or Shigella flexneri, increased histone H3 citrullination occurred through peptidylarginine deiminases. Citrullination is the conversion of positively charged arginine side chains into polar but uncharged citrulline side chains by deimination. Although there are five known peptidylarginine deiminases in humans, only peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), which is expressed by neutrophils, has a classical nuclear localization signal, and PAD4 inhibition was shown to prevent histone H3 citrullination and substantially reduce NET release. However, in addition to the beneficial roles of histones, Esmon and his colleagues 85 recently showed that histones injure the endothelium. They also found that activated protein C (APC), a therapeutic protein approved to treat sepsis, disables histone toxicity and preserves host cells 85 .",

For example, blocking TNF-\u03b1, nitric oxide, thrombin, TLR4, TPFI and many other molecules has failed in sepsis trials. Currently, aggressive fluid replacement and the rapid administration of broad spectrum antibiotics are crucial in improving mortality. APC helps in some individuals, however, even for APC, a second trial in individuals with severe sepsis has been initiated to assess the effectiveness and safety of this treatment. One important issue to address in trial design for potential sepsis therapies is that currently all subjects with sepsis are grouped together regardless of the cause of sepsis. Because the type of infection is often not immediately known at the time of study enrollment, recent clinical trials such as one that examined a TLR4 inhibitor (which detects primarily Gram-negative infections) would have tested the inhibitor in all subjects, even those with Gram-positive infections. Finally, microvascular hypercoagulation and disseminated intravascular coagulation are substantial problems in sepsis, and the only current specific therapy, APC, seems to be beneficial. Currently, intravenous heparin is being tested in the treatment of sepsis. Although thrombocytopenia is likely to be a poor prognostic sign in sepsis, no clinical trials to specifically block platelet function in sepsis have been attempted, to our knowledge, and it will be necessary to evaluate whether targeting this cell is of clinical benefit in future studies. r e v i e w broke down, perhaps leading to the release of NETs through a lytic event at a later time point (3-4 h after activation).

NETs have been reported in the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis, but whether treatment with DNase affects bacterial clearance and susceptibility to infection remains difficult to determine because many other medications, including antibiotics, are concomitantly used in these individuals.

            "text": "Platelets are an extension of neutrophils There is growing interest in the roles of platelets in inflammation and inflammatory diseases 90 . In arthropods, hemolymph contains hemocytes, which are nucleated circulating cells responsible for immunity as well as for coagulation. In higher order species, these functions have diverged into more specialized cells, but the platelet has retained some essential immune functions, particularly in partnership with neurophils 86, 87 . Initially, the neutrophils become rounded with uniformly condensed chromatin and then undergo nuclear envelope breakdown. Within these cells, small vesicles containing DNA can be seen in the cytoplasm near the plasma membrane. The DNA-containing vesicles eventually fuse with the plasma membrane, and NETs are released to trap bacteria. (ii) NETs can also be released through cell lysis, and this typically takes longer than the vesicular-mediated mechanism [81] [82] [83] [84] . The nuclear envelope is degraded, and chromatin decondensation occurs because of PAD4-mediated citrullination of histones. (iii) NET release by mitochondria has also been observed, in one study 83 , although the steps of this process remain poorly characterized. Figure 5 Platelet-neutrophil interactions within the liver vasculature during endotoxemia. (a) Intravital spinning-disk confocal visualization of neutrophils (blue) and platelets (red) in liver sinusoids in healthy (left) and endotoxemic (right) mice. Although no neutrophil-platelet interactions were detected in healthy mice (left), a notable difference was observed in endotoxemic mice, in which neutrophil-platelet interactions were very common within the liver vasculature (colocalization of red and blue, right). Scale bar, 25 \u00b5m. (b) Schematic showing the various cell-surface molecules on platelets and neutrophils. TLR4 expression by the platelet has been shown to be important for neutrophil activation in response to LPS. JAM-A and JAM-C expressed by platelets interact with neutrophil integrins CD11a-CD18 and CD11b-CD18, respectively. Interactions between platelets can also stimulate NET release from neutrophils 88 . r e v i e w and other phagocytes. Indeed, platelets can bind monocytes and neutrophils, leading to the transcellular synthesis of various inflammatory molecules 90, 91 . Even on its own, the platelet is an important immune cell and outnumbers all other leukocytes tenfold. Platelets express many major innate immune receptors, including most TLRs, thrombin-binding protease-activated receptors, complement receptors and numerous adhesion molecules 91 . Animal models have indicated that platelets are crucial to sepsis and acute lung injury 92 . In humans, thrombocytopenia, a prognostic marker for a poor outcome in sepsis, is a major complication in sepsis that often occurs in the sickest individuals (Box 1). Although disseminated intravascular coagulation and bone marrow suppression were thought to be the key reasons for this problem, administration of LPS caused platelets to disappear from the circulation within an hour 93 , suggesting that bone marrow suppression is an unlikely cause of thromocytopenia in some individuals. Platelets that have been sequestered into organs by binding to the endothelium or to already adherent neutrophils could explain some of the thrombocytopenia that occurs.",

            "text": "Under flow conditions, platelets have been shown to induce neutrophils to release NETs, thereby contributing to the killing of bacteria through this mechanism 88 . Why might a platelet-dependent NET mechanism be required? As neutrophils are activated at 100-fold lower concentrations of LPS than platelets are, and as LPS induces the non-NET-related functions of neutrophils, the platelet might function as a barometer for detecting substantial levels of bacterial products in blood. Platelets could then bind neutrophils and induce NET production as a last gasp effort to trap and destroy bacteria. This mechanism might occur preferentially in the vast microvasculature of the liver and lung where trapping of blood-borne bacteria may be the most efficient. Indeed, when a neutrophil binds in the very narrow sinusoids of the liver, it does not completely occlude the vessel, allowing plasma and bacteria to be skimmed around the neutrophils and collected in the released NETs. Although concentrations of LPS that are unlikely to ever be seen in infected humans were used in this model system, blood from septic individuals was equally effective at inducing NETs 88 . The major difference between the LPS and septic blood studies was that TLR4 only accounted for 30% of the NET formation in septic blood, suggesting that additional activators are present in septic blood.",

Another question that remains to be addressed, the answer to which may also differ in mice and humans, is whether there are different neutrophil subtypes, much like for monocytes. Indeed, mice have been reported to have multiple neutrophil subsets with unique surface receptor phenotypes and effector functions 94 . During experimental endotoxemia in humans, there is a large mobilization of band-like immature neutrophils that are CD16 low (compared to CD16 high for their mature counterparts). These immature cells tended to be less responsive to stimuli after administration of LPS and showed a smaller oxidative burst and reduced interactions with bacteria 95 .",

            "text": "Only about 20% of neutrophils make NETs. Whether this is because of maturity levels or subtypes is unclear. The possibility that a population of tissue-resident or perhaps continuously recirculating 'pioneer' neutrophils exists is intriguing 96 , although there is currently no direct evidence for this hypothesis. Indeed, it is possible that if a group of neutrophils expresses high concentrations of neutrophil chemotactic molecules such as LTB4, this may position it as a unique sentinel population that can recruit further neutrophil subsets 97 . The continuous expression of cytokines may also alter the neutrophil phenotype by inducing the expression of receptors that have normally been thought to recruit monocytes (such CCR2 and CCR1) 98 . In fact, the neutrophil phenotype may vary substantially over a typical septic episode that could last weeks. Understanding this moving target will be key to therapeutically modulating neutrophil function and also in the treatment of sepsis. In conclusion, theoretical intervention points affecting neutrophil biology that may be considered when treating sepsis include blocking platelet function or their binding to neutrophils, NET inhibition and targeting formylated peptides while preserving mitochondrial function.",

(c) The localizations of PTEN and PIP 2 (green) are shown in a neutrophil migrating in opposing gradients of endtarget (formylpeptide) and intermediary (CXCR2 ligand) chemoattractants.
