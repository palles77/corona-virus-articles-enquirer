            "text": "The equilibrium unfolding pathway of a 41-nucleotide frameshifting RNA pseudoknot from the gag-pro junction of mouse intracisternal Atype particles (mIAP), an endogenous retrovirus, has been determined through analysis of dual optical wavelength, equilibrium thermal melting pro\u00aeles and differential scanning calorimetry. The mIAP pseudoknot is an H-type pseudoknot proposed to have structural features in common with the gag-pro frameshifting pseudoknots from simian retrovirus-1 (SRV-1) and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). In particular, the mIAP pseudoknot is proposed to contain an unpaired adenosine base at the junction of the two helical stems (A15), as well as one in the middle of stem 2 (A35). A mutational analysis of stem 1 hairpins and compensatory base-pair substitutions incorporated into helical stem 2 was used to assign optical melting transitions to molecular unfolding events. The optical melting pro\u00aele of the wild-type RNA is most simply described by four sequential two-state unfolding transitions. Stem 2 melts \u00aerst in two closely coupled low-enthalpy transitions at low t m in which the stem 3 H to A35, unfolds \u00aerst, followed by unfolding of the remainder of the helical stem. The third unfolding transition is associated with some type of stacking interactions in the stem 1 hairpin loop not present in the pseudoknot. The fourth transition is assigned to unfolding of stem 1. In all RNAs investigated, \u00c1H vH % \u00c1H cal , suggesting that \u00c1C p for unfolding is small. A35 has the thermodynamic properties expected for an extrahelical, unpaired nucleotide. Deletion of A15 destabilizes the stem 2 unfolding transition in the context of both the wild-type and \u00c1A35 mutant RNAs only slightly, by \u00c1\u00c1G % 1 kcal mol \u00c01 (at 37 C). The \u00c1A15 RNA is considerably more susceptible to thermal denaturation in the presence of moderate urea concentrations than is the wild-type RNA, further evidence of a detectable global destabilization of the molecule. Interestingly, substitution of the nine loop 2 nucleotides with uridine residues induces a more pronounced destabilization of the molecule (\u00c1\u00c1G % 2.0 kcal mol \u00c01 ), a long-range, non-nearest neighbor effect. These \u00aendings provide the thermodynamic basis with which to further re\u00aene the relationship between ef\u00aecient ribosomal frameshifting and pseudoknot structure and stability.",

It has become clear that mRNAs contain secondary and tertiary structures both in the coding and non-coding regions and that these interactions are critical to regulation of translation in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. mRNA structures can regulate translation during initiation, elongation, and termination or by affecting the rate of mRNA degradation. Regulation of translation initiation has been observed when proteins interact with 5 H untranslated region (UTR) mRNA structures: for example, a hairpin in the case of the iron-responsive element (IRE) on the ferritin mRNA and an RNA pseudoknot in the case of the Escherichia coli a operon (Tang & Draper, 1990) . Hairpins and pseudoknots have also been implicated in ribosomal frameshifting and hopping during elongation, stop codon readthrough at termination and regulation of mRNA degradation (for a review, see .",

            "text": "The frequency at which frameshifting occurs is variable, from 1-5 % in some plant viruses up to 50 % in the dnaX frameshift site of E. coli (Larsen et al., 1997) with typical retroviral ef\u00aeciencies between 15 and 30 % (Brierly, 1995) . The \u00c01 ribosomal frameshift site is typically composed of a heptameric nucleotide sequence X XXY YYZ in the zero coding frame. The identities of the nucleotides vary in different sites and between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The primary sequence requirement appears to be that at least two of the three mRNA codon-tRNA anticodon base-pairing interactions can be maintained in the new frame (XXX YYY Z). The simultaneous slippage model was proposed to describe the mechanism of \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting from studies of the gag-pol junction frameshift site in Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) (Jacks et al., 1988) . In this model, both the A and P sites of the ribosome contain tRNAs and the frameshift occurs when both the A and P-site tRNAs slip into the \u00c01 frame on the slip site heptamer. Sites with high frameshifting ef\u00aeciencies typically have mRNA structures required for maintaining high ef\u00aeciency located three to nine nucleotides downstream of the slippery heptamer. In many, though not all cases, the structural element downstream of the slippery site is proposed to form an H-type RNA pseudoknot. One explanation is that these RNA structures simply slow or stall the ribosome temporarily, increasing the amount of time the ribosome spends on the slippery sequence, and (Fehrmann et al., 1997) . The slip site heptamer is enclosed in a box and the pseudoknot structural elements are annotated. The structure of this pseudoknot has yet to be determined. The adenosine at the junction (A15), shown unpaired in this model, may be paired with the \u00aenal uridine in loop 2 (U31) and it is not clear which of the two adenosine bases (A35 and A36) in stem 2 is paired with U11.

In ScV, ribosomal pausing was assayed using``heelprinting'' to locate regions of the mRNA protected from nuclease digestion in the presence of translating ribosomes. Ribosomal pausing was monitored at the IBV frameshift site by examining the size and distribution of incomplete polypeptide intermediates generated from initiation-synchronized in vitro translation over time. Pausing was shown to correlate well with frameshift ef\u00aeciency but both studies observed structures with normal pausing but no detectable frameshifting. This suggests that ribosomal pausing is necessary, but not suf\u00aecient, for frameshifting. In addition, thermodynamic stability of the RNA structure alone apparently cannot account for frameshifting ef\u00aeciency at the ScV and IBV frameshift sites, although this point has not been thoroughly investigated.",

This pseudoknot has been subjected to mutational analysis and structure probing (Chamorro et al., 1992; Chen et al., 1995) and the solution structure has been solved by NMR . In addition, the structures of frameshifting and non-frameshifting variants have also been determined (Chen et al., 1996; Kang et al., 1996; Kang & Tinoco, 1997) . Frameshifting ef\u00aeciency in these MMTV pseudoknot derivatives was found to correlate with a speci\u00aecally bent conformation, where the two helical stems were prevented from coaxially stacking by a single unpaired adenosine at the helical junction. An extensive mutational study was also performed on the pseudoknot at the gag-pro frameshift site in simian retrovirus 1 (SRV-1) (ten Dam et al., 1995) . The frameshifting ef\u00aeciency of base-pair substitutions in the second stem of the pseudoknot correlated qualitatively with the predicted thermodynamic stability of that stem. NMR evidence suggests that the closing A-U base-pair in stem 2 at the helical junction is formed while mutational analysis suggests that the identity of the two nucleotides and their ability to base-pair have no affect on frameshifting ef\u00aeciency (Chen et al.,1996; Sung & Kang, 1998) , prompting these authors to hypothesize that the SRV-1 pseudoknot is also bent, like in MMTV.",

The proposed pseudoknot shares some similarities with the SRV-1 and MMTV pseudoknots, including potential structural ambiguity at the junction of the two helical stems in which A15 may or may not base-pair with U31 in loop 2 (Figure 1(a) ). mIAP is an endogenous mouse retrovirus which phylogenetic analysis of the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of the pol gene reveals is a member of a closely related subclass of retroviruses that includes both SRV-1 and MMTV (Li et al., 1995) . Study of mIAP will therefore allow us to examine the general structural and stability features of this group of retroviral frameshifting pseudoknots.",

The pro\u00aele exhibits hyperchromicity in two transitions, a broad low intensity transition between 30 and 50 C and a sharper, higher intensity transition above 80 C, both with signi\u00aecant hyperchromicity at 280 nm as expected for the high G-C content of the two helical stems (Fresco et al., 1963) . Even though initial inspection gives the appearance of only two tran-sitions, it was necessary to \u00aet the data to four sequential two-state transitions in order to eliminate the periodic deviation in the residuals observed when \u00aetting to fewer transitions. Turner rules compiled at 1 M NaCl predict an enthalpy of 68 and 77 kcal mol \u00c01 for the melting of stems 1 and 2, respectively, provided seven base-pairs are formed in stem 2 and the 3 H single-stranded nucleotide stacks against the stem (Turner et al., 1988; He et al., 1991; Xia et al., 1998) . The predicted stabilization due to stacked Watson-Crick base-pairs was calculated using the modi\u00aeed individual nearest-neighbor model (INN-HB) parameters which account for the difference in stabilization between internal and closing A-U base-pairs (Xia et al., 1998) . The thermodynamic parameters for hairpin and bulge loops reported by Turner et al. (1988) were used. In good agreement with these predictions, the \u00aerst two transitions have a combined \u00c1H 75 kcal mol \u00c01 and the \u00aenal transition has an \u00c1H 66.7 kcal mol \u00c01 , suggesting that stem 2 unfolds \u00aerst in two steps with stem 1 unfolding at much higher temperature.",

Unexpectedly, the optical melting pro\u00aele of the mIAP-HP shows three distinct transitions. The \u00aerst transition is unusual in that it has signi\u00aecant hyperchromicity (dA/dT) only at 260 nm with a very high enthalpy (\u00c1H 76 kcal mol \u00c01 ) at t m 47 C. The second transition has an \u00c1H 42 kcal mol \u00c01 and an (dA 260 /dT)/(dA 280 /dT) value (A 260 / A 280 ratio) of %0.26, while the third transition is characterized by \u00c1H 57 kcal mol \u00c01 and A 260 / A 280 % 0.36. The melting pro\u00aele was superimposable in both the folding and unfolding directions (data not shown). The combined enthalpy of these transitions is 175 kcal mol \u00c01 , much larger than would be predicted from the nearest-neighbor model for the stem 1 hairpin (64 kcal mol \u00c01 ). The molecular origin of the \u00aerst unfolding transition is unknown; however, it is observed calorimetrically as well with essentially identical van't Hoff thermodynamic parameters (data not shown). The second transition shows a concentration dependence over the 2-55 mM range consistent with predictions for formation of some kind of intermolecular structure. The high enthalpy and t m and low A 260 /A 280 ratio of the third optical transition are consistent with predictions for the unfolding of a stem consisting of six G-C basepairs.",

This mutation therefore destabilizes the \u00aerst transition both enthalpically and entropically, suggesting that the \u00aerst transition corresponds to unfolding of the substem 3 H to the unpaired adenosine base in stem 2. The entropic destabilization of the second transition is likely due to the tight coupling of the \u00aerst two transitions on the temperature coordinate, since it reports on the unfolding of the same secondary structural unit.",

The mIAP pseudoknot shares some similarities with the SRV-1 and MMTV pseudoknots including structural ambiguity at the junction of the two helical stems. Deletion of the junction adenosine base in the mIAP pseudoknot, A15, is only slightly destabilizing with \u00c1\u00c1G (37 C) % 1 kcal mol \u00c01 . This destabilization is smaller than would be predicted for the loss of an A-U base-pair and coaxial stacking on stem 1. The close approach of backbone phosphate groups at the helical junction in RNA pseudoknots sometimes creates a region high in negative electrostatic potential which has been suggested as a possible location for chelation of divalent metal ions with higher af\u00aenity than duplex RNA (Gluick et al., 1997; Puglisi et al., 1990; Nixon & Giedroc, 1998) . Therefore, mutations at the helical junction might destabilize an RNA pseudoknot by signi\u00aecantly altering higher af\u00aenity divalent binding sites. The wild-type mIAP and \u00c1A15 pseudoknots were studied over a wide range of Mg 2 concentrations (50 mM-50 mM), and the dependence of t m on [Mg 2 ] for the F 3 S1 J and S1 J 3 I transitions \u00aet to a non-speci\u00aec binding model for divalent ions (Figure 6 ). The magnitude of K f and K u , which represent the average af\u00aenities of the RNAs for Mg 2 , were found to be reasonable for non-speci\u00aec binding in a background of 50 mM KCl compared to the magnitudes of K f and K u values determined for the pseudoknot from bacteriophage T2 gene 32 mRNA at 100 mM KCl (Nixon & Giedroc, 1998; Nixon et al., 1999) . More importantly, the Mg 2 binding af\u00aenities were found to be virtually identical for these two RNAs, suggesting that it is unlikely that the A15 deletion causes the loss of a speci\u00aec ion binding site or results in differential accumulation of ions in the pseudoknot. The uncoupling of the two stem 2 transitions in the \u00c1A15 molecule in the presence of urea (Figure 8) , with the region of stem 2 closest to the junction becoming stabilized toward urea denaturation compared to the mIAP pseudoknot, however, suggests that the helical junction in the F and S1 J conformations of the \u00c1A15 pseudoknot may be better stacked than in the wildtype mIAP pseudoknot.",

Structure probing experiments indicate that the unpaired adenosine base in stem 2, A35, and the adenosine bases in loop 2 are substantially more susceptible to DEPC modi\u00aecation than is A15 in the wild-type mIAP pseudoknot (T.

The reduced susceptibility of A15 to both chemical modi\u00aecation and enzymatic cleavage may suggest that some or all of the A15 nucleotide is not totally exposed to solvent; additional structural insight will have to await further structural studies. Analogous thermodynamic studies of the structurally characterized MMTV-vpk pseudoknot suggest that the unpaired adenosine base at the junction does not contribute exceptional stability to the pseudoknot and in fact provides stabilization equivalent to that predicted for a 3 H single-stranded nucleotide stacked on the junction base-pair of stem 2 (unpublished results).",

Deletion of A35 is predicted to be stabilizing, allowing the formation of an uninterrupted stem 2, which would unfold in a single cooperative transition. A15 and A35 were both deleted in the \u00c1A35A15 RNA, to determine if the A15 deletion, which is only modestly destabilizing in the context of the wild-type pseudoknot, has the same effect in the context of a continuous stem 2. The calculated and predicted thermodynamic parameters for the \u00c1A35 and \u00c1A35A15 RNAs are summarized in Table 3 . The \u00c1A35 RNA stabilizes the mIAP pseudoknot by 3.2 kcal mol \u00c01 , exactly as expected for the elimination of the entropic destabilization predicted for a single nucleotide bulge in a helical stem (Turner et al., 1988) . Although the molecular origin may well be different, deletion of A15 in the context of the \u00c1A35 deletion reveals that the free energy of unfolding of stem 2 is also %1 kcal mol \u00c01 smaller than \u00c1A35 RNA, coupled with a small perturbation in the stability of stem 1.

The substitution of the loop 2 sequence with uridine bases in the mIAP pseudoknot uncouples the F 3 S1 J and S1 J 3 I unfolding events, destabilizing the 3 H substem and stabilizing the junction substem. The combined enthalpy of the \u00aerst two stem 2 transitions is close to that predicted for the entire helical stem, and the overall destabilization compared to the mIAP pseudoknot \u00c1\u00c1G (37 C) is 1.2 kcal mol \u00c01 from optical melts and 3.0 kcal mol \u00c01 determined calorimetrically. Interestingly, the L2U mutant melting pro\u00aele bears a striking resemblance to the effect of 20-25 % urea on the melting pro\u00aele of the \u00c1A15 RNA pseudoknot (Figure 8 ). This suggests that the origin of this perturbation of the stability of the molecule by uridine substitution of loop 2 may be similar to that induced by low concentrations of urea. The mechanism by which urea destabilizes RNA is not known, but hydrogen bonding to RNA functional groups or a change in solvent ordering are two possibilities. In any case, both effects are likely transmitted through a selectively weakened junction region. These \u00aendings suggest that caution must be exercised in ascribing changes in frameshifting ef\u00aeciency to nucleotide sequence effects, due to the possibility of a change in the global stability of the molecule.",

We have determined that (1) the unfolding pathway proceeds in four de\u00aenable steps, (2) the unfolding thermodynamics suggest that \u00c1C p is small in this system, (3) stabilization by Mg 2 can be fully accounted for by the impact of delocalized, non-speci\u00aecally bound ions, (4) the unpaired adenosine base at the helical junction A15 is only modestly stabilizing, and (5) substitution of the loop 2 nucleotide sequence with uridine bases is destabilizing in the context of the mIAP pseudoknot. Experiments are in progress in this laboratory to characterize the structures and frameshifting activity of these molecules. These experiments will allow us to systematically explore the relationships between thermodynamic stability, frameshifting activity, structure, and dynamics and help us to clarify the role of downstream pseudoknots on programmed ribosomal frameshifting.",

The recovered RNA was loaded onto a C18-cartridge (Alltech), eluted with a 50 % (v/v) methanol wash, taken to dryness and subjected to exhaustive dialysis against 10 mM Mops (pH 7.0), 50 mM KCl. The \u00aerst change of dialysis buffer contained 10 mM EDTA, with the subsequent (two or three) changes containing no EDTA. RNAs were stored at \u00c020 C. Samples were prepared for thermal denaturation by diluting into \u00aenal dialysis buffer, heating at 90 C for \u00aeve minutes, slow cooling to room temperature, and then adding the appropriate concentration of MgSO 4 . This procedure was found to be most effective at removing RNA dimers formed at the stock solution concentration.
