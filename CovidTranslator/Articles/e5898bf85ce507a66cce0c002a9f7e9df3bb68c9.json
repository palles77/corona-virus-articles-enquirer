These infections are usually mild and self-limited and are mostly seen in young children and in adults living close together, such as military recruits. Only rarely does severe infection develop in subjects presumed to be healthy [1, 2] . However, the potential of adenoviral infection to disseminate and cause severe illness in immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing bone marrow or solid organ transplantation [3, 4] and those with malignant neoplasms [5] and HIV infection [6] , has been well described. The mortality in such patient populations is reported to be high. We describe here a case of community-acquired pneumonia caused by adenovirus in a previously healthy patient who was later shown to have stage A chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL). ",

Physical examination showed moderate dyspnea, coughing, and a temperature of 38.8 \u2022 C; conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, gastroenteritis and rash were not observed. Inspiratory crackles were noted on the left upper thorax. Cardiovascular and abdominal findings were unremarkable. Routine laboratory tests revealed a hemoglobin count of 7.5 mmol/l, leukocytosis of 35\u00d7109/l, thrombocyte count of 114\u00d7109/l, C-reactive protein 269 mg/l (normal, <10 mg/l), bilirubin 12 \u00b5mol/l (normal, <21 \u00b5mol/l), and S-aspartate aminotransferase 132 U/l (normal, 10-50 U/l). Chest radiograph revealed an infiltrate on the upper left side, and therapy with intravenous penicillin was initiated since pneumococcal pneumonia in Denmark remains sensitive to this agent. Blood cultures were negative, and attempts to obtain a sputum sample were unsuccessful.",

The patient was transferred to our hospital because of worsening signs on chest radiographs and increasing oxygen requirements. Laboratory tests performed at admission to our hospital revealed increased leukocytosis at 62.4\u00d7109/l (95% lymphocytes), C-reactive protein 171 mg/l, bilirubin 96 \u00b5mol/l, S-aspartate aminotransferase 132 U/l, lactate dehydrogenase 867 U/l (normal, <450 U/l), and alkaline phosphatase 629 U/l (normal, 70-275 U/l). Evaluation of jaundice revealed a negative Coombs test and no indication of hemolysis. A posteroanterior chest radiograph showed consolidation of the lingual and left upper lobes as well as right-sided perihilar infiltrates (Fig. 1 ). Respiratory support was provided for 6 days via a continuous positive airway pressure system on a face mask. Atypical pneumonia was suspected and empiric antibacterial therapy with erythromycin and rifampicin (later ciprofloxacin) was administered for 3 weeks. Hypogammaglobulinemia was diagnosed after an IgG count of 4.0 g/l (normal, 6.1-14.9 g/l) was obtained, and 20 g of human immunoglobulin was administered intravenously. The patient recovered slowly and was discharged without respiratory symptoms.",

However, it is difficult to assess the influence of this comorbidity on the course of the adenoviral infection. In the literature, only two other reports have identified patients with CLL and adenoviral pneumonia, and both patients had a fatal outcome [7, 8] . Nevertheless, it is clear from those two reports, that the patients were far more immunocompromised than ours, with one patient having received multiple courses of chemotherapy and the other having cytopenia at the time of diagnosis [7, 8] . Patients with CLL frequently have low levels of immunoglobulin, as did our patient, and most of the infectious complications they experience are caused by bacteria. Severe viral infections, with the exception of reactivated herpes zoster, are rare in this patient population.

The manifestations in both organs regressed spontaneously. At presentation and for several days thereafter the patient had significantly elevated levels of C-reactive protein, which suggested a bacterial etiology.

Since a low level of IgG was detected (secondary to CLL) the patient was given human immunoglobulin, which in itself may have antiviral efficacy.
