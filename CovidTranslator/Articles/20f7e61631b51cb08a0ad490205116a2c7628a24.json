Here we review the existing data about mammalian host species, comparing and contrasting these patterns against global maps of zoonotic hosts from all 27 orders of terrestrial mammals. We discuss the zoonotic potential of host species from the top six most species-rich mammal groups, and review the literature to identify analytical and conceptual gaps that must be addressed to improve our ability to generate testable predictions about zoonotic diseases originating from wild mammals.",

Whether looking across multiple diseases to glean generalizable epidemiological insight, or at specific diseases to identify important covariates predicting particular human outbreaks, previous studies have combined detailed data on human infectious disease events and environmental factors to quantify current and to predict future disease hotspots (e.g., [2 -6] ). Such baseline data provide important starting points for making projections of human disease risk, and can be effectively applied to predict the spread of particular infectious diseases to new areas that are in close proximity, or located in environments similar to historical outbreak locations (e.g., [6 , 7] ). As one example, data describing the ecology of bat reservoirs of Nipah virus can help make projections about the kinds of environments expected to support cases of human disease [5] . Such baseline data can then be applied to identify and manage similar locations where future Nipah outbreaks might be predicted to occur. However, data from past outbreaks may offer little towards efforts to predict outbreaks of completely novel diseases that punctuate the status quo -for example, the emergence of new zoonotic pathogens, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [8] , or outbreaks of known zoonoses in unexpected areas, such as Ebola virus disease in West Africa [9] . Because of their often surprising departures from previous outbreak patterns, some argue that disease events may be inherently unpredictable (e.g., [10] ). Predicting outbreaks, caused either by novel pathogens or known pathogens in novel places, remains one of the biggest scientific challenges of our time. We agree that this is a hard problem, but disagree that it is impossible. This causes us to ask, what kind of data are available that may facilitate more effective prediction?",

Recognizing that a parasite or pathogen is unlikely to persist in all populations of its definitive host(s), we think of the collective geographic ranges of known host species as the maximum potential current geographic range of a zoonosis. Visualizing this potential range offers a baseline from which we can ask basic comparative questions about realized and unrealized risk of zoonotic diseases and offers a launch point for building predictive models of future zoonotic disease events.",

These components of disease risk rely on several factors that are external to the host-pathogen system. Extrinsic factors, such as urbanization, agriculture and socioeconomic standing, control host and human population dynamics underlying the frequency of transmissible contacts at the humanwildlife and the wildlife-livestock interface [5 , 18 , 20 -22] . Intrinsic factors (of hosts, pathogens, and vectors) combine with extrinsic factors to contribute to disease risk in humans. Intrinsic factors include life history [23 -25] , behavior [26 , 27] , competence [28 -30] , and rapid evolutionary changes in animal hosts and pathogens [31 -33] ; transmission modes and host breadth in pathogens [13 , 34 , 35] ; and differences in host susceptibility, often conferred by prosperity or poverty in human populations [36] , and pristine or degraded communities in wildlife hosts [37] . Thus, regions can have high zoonotic risk for multiple reasons -people living in regions with inherently high zoonotic potential may be considered at high risk, but so too can those living in regions with low host and pathogen diversity but increasing external pressures (such as warming or urbanization) that may facilitate the transmission of some zoonoses through a cascade of environmental changes [38 -41] .",

Investigating the features shared in common among regions with high realized disease risk (in the form of recurring or new observed outbreaks) is a first step to understanding what triggers these events (e.g., [2 , 4 , 5 , 42] ). But comparing regions with high realized disease risk offers limited utility for forecasting unexpected disease events, which requires quantifying unrealized disease risk. Disruptive extrinsic pressures in regions of high zoonotic potential where host or pathogen richness is already particularly high could trigger spillover to human hosts. Identifying locations with high zoonotic potential but without overt signs of disease emergence could signal regions where pathogen transmission is high but transition to disease is low (Ebola virus outside Africa, [43] ) or areas where transition to disease is low because pathogen transmission is currently low, but once transmission occurs, disease will increase as a matter of course (e.g., Ebola virus disease within Africa, [6] ).",

While the diversity of host species corresponds well to global biodiversity patterns, the biogeography of human outbreaks is less straightforwardly explained by biodiversity. For rodents, Han et al. [23] found a greater diversity of zoonotic hosts and diseases in regions with low overall mammal biodiversity. They also found that the number of human outbreaks caused by rodent-borne zoonoses (since 1990) is concentrated in northerly latitudes, especially Europe [23] . In terms of emergence, the majority of human infectious diseases emerged for the first time in northerly latitudes, with a hotspot in Europe [2] . Unsurprisingly, zoonoses with wildlife (as opposed to domesticated species) origins were found to emerge more frequently in humans populations occurring in biodiverse areas (as measured by wildlife species richness, which includes, but is not restricted to, mammals) [2] . In contrast, the emergence frequency of zoonoses from non-sylvatic (e.g., domesticated species) origins is best explained by human population density and by latitude [2] , with no identifiable significance of biodiversity. These patterns provide additional evidence for the general expectation that zoonoses pose greater risks with increasing human contact with animal sources [18 , 46 , 47] .",

As more resources are dedicated to disease-related research and treatment in the northern hemisphere [2 , 34 , 36 , 44] , the number of hosts and pathogens discovered in these countries tends to increase (e.g., [49 , 50] ). However, if such biases were the sole factor driving this pattern, hotspots of similar magnitude would be expected in the United States and Canada, since these countries span similar latitudes, exhibit similar overall species richness [45] , and apportion the greatest expenditures towards biological and healthrelated research [http://apps.who.int/nha/database/World_Map/Index/en]. An open question is whether human population density alone is driving these geographic patterns, as human populations are spread over larger areas in North America compared to Europe.",

These communities display different patterns of functional diversity compared to those in the tropics, with each temperate species contributing disproportionately to ecosystem processes compared to tropical species [52] . Studies that move beyond occurrence-based metrics (e.g., richness) to consider the functional trait diversity of host and pathogen species may reveal another dimension to what is driving geographic patterns of zoonotic diversity. Whether temperate hosts carry proportionately more zoonoses or whether zoonotic pathogens in temperate zones exhibit proportionately greater host breadth compared to tropical systems is an open question [53] . Comparing the topologies of host-pathogen networks in temperate vs. tropical regions is one approach to answering this question (e.g., [54 , 55] ).",

            "text": "Across the 27 terrestrial mammal orders, there is wide variation in both the total number of species, and the fraction of species in each order that are zoonotic hosts ( Figure 2 ; Figures S1-S3). In the most speciose orders (blue boxes, Figure 2 ), the number of zoonotic hosts increases with total species richness of the order, a pattern which may be explained in part by accumulating evidence that parasitism drives host diversification (reviewed in [56] ). But further examination of the variation around this general trend is warranted. For example, groups with more zoonotic host species than expected for the richness of the clade (e.g., orders that fall above a regression line through points in Figure 2 ) may share suites of similar intrinsic or extrinsic factors enabling more successful pathogen transmission (e.g., [57] ), or more frequent human contacts that, over time, facilitate the transition of a novel infection to a disease state in humans [18 , 19 , 58] (e.g., the ungulates, a paraphyletic group that includes the Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla; ungulates comprise the majority of domesticated mammal species). Conversely, orders with fewer zoonotic hosts than expected for the richness of the clade (those below a regression line) may reflect species that have been poorly sampled for zoonoses, or species that carry fewer zoonoses due to unique combinations of intrinsic and extrinsic features. For example, the marsupial carnivores (Dasyuromorpha), much like placental carnivores (Carnivora), have less direct contact with humans compared to other clades (e.g., Rodents, Ungulates) [59] , which may reduce the risk of zoonotic transmission to humans. However, many dasyuromorphs have regular contact with domesticated species (for example, domesticated dogs, especially when Tasmanian devils and quolls are attracted to livestock on farms [60] ), providing opportunity for human exposure through farm animals on human-modified environments [46] .",

A Web of Science search on the Latin binomials of all extant mole and shrew species returned a total of 4600 citations, which is 1-2 orders of magnitude fewer studies than for other speciose mammal orders (blue box, Figure 2 ). Zoonotic hosts in this order are distributed widely across north temperate latitudes, with the greatest number of host species overlapping across Europe and across the Atlantic coast of the United States ( Figure 3 , Key Figure) .

Carnivoran hosts are among the most widely distributed in terms of spatial extent (Figure 3 , Key Figure) , with hotspots of host diversity in Southern and East Africa, Southeast Asia, and the subarctic region of North America. This contrasts patterns of carnivoran species richness, which is concentrated in the southern hemisphere (particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia; Figure S5 ). Previous studies showed that pathogen richness (zoonotic and non-zoonotic) closely tracked carnivore species richness [64] , and that the range of carnivoran host species infected by a pathogen depends primarily on host phylogenetic relatedness [65] . In addition, research exploring the degree to which carnivorans accumulate the infectious agents of their prey (which can themselves be zoonotic hosts) will contribute to understanding whether the distribution of carnivoran hosts are tracking the diversity of prey items.",

Primates are generally found in the global equatorial zone, with greatest species diversity in the rainforests of Africa, the Neotropics, and Asia [70] . Primate zoonotic host richness is greatest in equatorial Africa (in central Africa in the Congo Basin, and West Africa), in Southeast Asia, and in the tropical/ mixed forest regions of northern Brazil and the Guyana Shield. Over 20% of primate species are zoonotic hosts (21%; 77/365 species) for at least one of 63 unique zoonoses. Thus, while there are fewer species of primates overall, a greater proportion of primate are zoonotic hosts than either the rodents or the bats.",

            "text": "Importantly, the hotspots identified here depict regions with the greatest number of overlapping zoonotic host species, excluding other components of disease risk. In general, increasing opportunities for human exposure to animal groups with high zoonotic potential will increase the risk of zoonotic disease in humans. In addition to overall host richness of an area, zoonotic potential depends on the chance that a species is a zoonotic host given the order it belongs to, and breadth of zoonoses harbored by host species in a given order [13] . Thus, based on the results described above, rodents can be considered to have high zoonotic potential because there are more rodent host species than hosts from any other mammal group. And while there are fewer carnivoran species in comparison to rodents, they may also be considered to have high zoonotic potential because a greater fraction of them are zoonotic hosts (i.e., given an encounter with a carnivore, the likelihood that it is a zoonotic host is higher than for an equivalent encounter with a rodent from which there are comparatively fewer zoonotic hosts). If the high degree of parasite sharing suggests that the majority of zoonoses has already been transmitted from wild reservoirs to humans, the fact that humans already share a large number of zoonoses with carnivorans may indicate there are few zoonoses left to spillover anew (novel emergence) but many available to seed re-emergence events. Carnivorans also carry a greater diversity of zoonotic pathogens than any other mammal group. While zoonotic potential is considered high for rodents based purely on numerical frequency, there may be something intrinsic about carnivores where, despite relatively low direct contact with humans, they are more permissive to zoonotic infections and may be particularly good at sustaining them even if the risk of transmissible contacts with humans is lower. Similarly, while there are fewer species of ungulates compared to rodents, bats, primates, carnivorans, and insectivorans ( Figure 2 , Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla), many more wild ungulates are closely related to domesticated livestock species that humans are in regular and increasingly close contact, which could facilitate successful transmission [13 , 20 , 67 , 71] . Bats are suspected to be particularly permissive hosts of zoonotic infection [72 , 73] , but outside of the paleotropics where bats are hunted as bushmeat, direct human contact with bats is likely surpassed by contact with rodents. Thus, for both bats and carnivorans, it may be more likely that spillover is facilitated by indirect transmission (e.g., for bats, contact with partially consumed food, including insects, vertebrates, and fruit; [12 , 74] ; for carnivorans, contact with domesticated pets or livestock, and through parasite shedding in encroaching habitats [75] ). These patterns should also be tempered by more explicit quantification of surveillance bias. For example, the surveillance scrutiny applied to bats for particular pathogen types (e.g., viruses [76 , 77] ), may skew the number of species found to be positive for zoonotic viruses. Similar surveillance biases across other clades will impede comparisons of relative zoonotic disease risk posed by particular mammal groups or species.",

Such hotspots occur where many zoonotic hosts overlap in geographic range, and thus their zoonotic pathogens also overlap. The histograms in Figure 1 show that species richness of zoonotic hosts reflects latitudinal gradients reminiscent of well-known biogeographical patterns in free-living organisms (more host species at lower latitudes) [78] . However, the richness of zoonotic diseases does not exhibit this pattern: despite wide variation in the global distribution of land mass and species richness, chi-squared tests showed that the numbers of unique zoonoses found across 30-degree longitudinal bands were not significantly different from each other ( =17.571, p-value=0.09; similar analyses across 30-degree bands of latitude and longitude showed expected geographical patterns of higher richness of hosts and zoonoses in the tropics, and in the longitudinal bands capturing greater land mass, Table S1 ). Compared to zoonotic mammal hosts, zoonoses are distributed more evenly worldwide (Figure 4) suggesting that, compared to wildlife-specific pathogens whose ranges are delimited by ecological interactions regulating their host and vector populations [42 , 79 -81] , the distributions of zoonoses are not as tightly coupled to the distribution of their host species. Zoonoses are not as broadly distributed as human-specific diseases [34] , but are possibly more labile than wildlife diseases due to the mobility and range expansion of human populations [34 , 42 , 82] while adhering to biogeographic grouping patterns reflecting ecological barriers to animal host species establishment and dispersal [42] .",

            "text": "Though major hotspots of mammal hosts occur in the New and Old World tropics (South America and Eastern Africa, particularly; Figure 1 ), there are more zoonoses concentrated in northern latitudes, Eastern Africa, and Southeast Asia (Figure 4 ). This is opposite to the patterns depicted for zoonotic hosts in the tropics, where host richness is expected to match global patterns of high species richness that increase the frequency of consumer-resource interactions overall, including parasitic interactions [83] . In addition to the hotspots of human emerging diseases observed in the tropics and Europe, Figure 4 draws attention to the global subarctic. While this region has lower zoonotic host and species diversity compared to other biogeographic regions, mammals found in the subarctic zone harbor more zoonoses than hosts from other regions. In general, mammal species are predominantly constrained by their abiotic environments, but pathogens contend primarily with the biotic environment presented by their hosts (e.g., [84] ). Thus, one possible explanation of this pattern is that while there are fewer host species in the global subarctic compared to other regions of the world, the pathogens causing zoonoses in these species are saturating all available niches, leading to greater evenness (i.e., a larger fraction of species are zoonotic hosts; Figure S3 ) and higher prevalence (i.e., a larger fraction of the host population that is infected). These broad and opposing patterns call for future studies to investigate more directly what is driving geographic patterns of zoonotic host richness vs. richness of zoonotic diseases, an endeavor which subsumes direct confrontation of pervasive issues of sampling bias (for wildlife species) and reporting bias (for human disease cases) inherent to data on pathogens and disease. Such studies will also benefit from the large literature investigating biogeography of parasitic organisms writ large [85] .",

While zoonotic pathogens are geographically widespread (Figure 5a) , they are unevenly distributed across mammal groups (Figure 5b) , with carnivores carrying the greatest number of viral and bacterial zoonoses, rodents carrying the most zoonotic helminths, and ungulates carrying more zoonotic protozoa compared to other mammal groups (Figure 5b ). Discerning the human disease risk posed by various pathogen types will require cross-referencing these broad patterns with zoonotic host patterns (Figure 3, Key Figure) . For example, based purely on frequencies (i.e., excluding factors influencing contact rates with humans, etc.), the zoonotic virus hotspot in Europe (Figure 5a ) could be driven by the high diversity of rodent hosts ( Figure  3d ). Mapping zoonoses by pathogen type and mammal clade may better characterize the host and pathogen community contributing to broad patterns. Human disease risk posed by different pathogen types will also depend on their host breadth. In response to the emergence of prominent viral zoonoses in humans (e.g., MERS, SARS) and evidence of frequent host switching [86 , 87] , recent studies have aimed to understand the zoonotic potential of viruses, particularly those arising from bats [86 , 88] . In addition to characterizing the propensity for host switching among particular host clades and pathogen types, comparative studies of host competence will inform the relative contributions of host species as pathogen sinks or conduits for further transmission.",

Ultimately, there are many factors describing hosts, pathogens, and environments that combine to determine the risk of zoonotic disease emergence from mammal species. Understanding the current geographic and taxonomic distributions of zoonotic mammalian hosts offers an important baseline of empirical data against which observed patterns of human disease can be compared to improve first-order predictions of human disease risk posed by wild mammals. Here, we have summarized the global distributions of mammal hosts and the zoonoses they carry, and discuss them in context of existing research on human zoonoses. These hotspots provide only a partial view of zoonotic disease risk in humans and highlight many outstanding questions for future research (see Outstanding Questions). Moving forward, studies comparing hotspots of mammal hosts or particular pathogen types against the spatial landscape of epidemiological metrics (e.g., prevalence, incidence, frequency of disease events in human populations) and extrinsic drivers (e.g., environmental, sociopolitical, economic) will continue to triangulate those areas where high realized risk of human disease coincides with high zoonotic potential. Such comparisons may also reveal zoonotic coldspots that offer important points of contrast to identifying sources and triggers of unrealized disease risk.",

Many case studies now concur that these drivers can be intrinsic to the hosts [23 , 72] , or result from changing human ecology [5 , 48 , 92] . Future studies that partition and quantify the components of zoonotic transmission and the transition of infection to human disease will offer much-needed inroads to assessing the most effective approaches to prevent, manage, or intervene in wild animal systems to achieve the broader goal of mitigating zoonotic disease burden worldwide.",
