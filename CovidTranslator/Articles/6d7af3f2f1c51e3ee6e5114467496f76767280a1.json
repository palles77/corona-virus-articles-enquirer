            "text": "Aim: To establish a system for monitoring the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) using \u03b2-lactamase enzyme fragment complementation (EFC) technology. Methods: Two inactive \u03b2-lactamase deletion fragments, bla(a) and bla(b), were fused to \u03b2-arrestin and GPCR, respectively. A stable cell line named HEK/293-\u03b22a2, which expressed two fusion proteins, GPCR/bla(b) and \u03b2-arrestin2/bla(a), was generated under antibiotic selection. A natural compound library of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-fractionated samples from the ethanol extracts of Chinese medicinal herbs was used for high-throughput screening (HTS) of \u03b22-adrenoceptor (\u03b22AR) agonists against the cell line HEK/293-\u03b22a2. The interested hits were validated by the measurement of second-messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production. Results: The stable cell line HEK/293-\u03b22a2 responded to \u03b22AR agonist/antagonist in a dose-dependent manner. The EC 50 value obtained for isoproterenol was 15.5 nmol/L, and the IC 50 value obtained for propranolol was 51.9 nmol/L. Furthermore, HTS was performed to identify \u03b22AR agonists from the natural compound library we established. The Z\u2032 factor value was determined to be 0.68. Three hits were identified from primary screening and found to be as potent as isoproterenol in a cAMP assay. Conclusion: A cell-based high-throughput functional assay was established to directly monitor the activation of GPCRs based on the interaction between agonist-activated GPCR and \u03b2-arrestin using \u03b2-lactamase EFC technology, which can be used to search for leads in the natural compound library.",

The \u03b2-lactamase-based enzyme fragment complementation (EFC) assay was pioneered in 2002 [16, 17] . The properties of \u03b2-lactamase provide significant advantages in mammalian cells. \u03b2-lactamase is monomeric and relatively small [18] , and it can be expressed in many different cell types and diverse cellular compartments [19] . In addition, there is no endogenous \u03b2-lactamase activity. A highly sensitive cellpermeable fluorescent substrate, CCF4/AM, also offers great potential for the quantification of results in intact cells [20] . In our research, we successfully applied this system to monitor GPCRs activation. Two inactive \u03b2-lactamase deletion fragments, bla(a) and bla(b), were fused to \u03b2-arrestin and GPCR, respectively. The two \u03b2-lactamase fragments complement each other and recover activity by agonist-promoted interaction between GPCR and \u03b2-arrestin. The recovery of \u03b2-lactamase activity was then determined with the cell-permeable fluorescent substrate, CCF4/AM, to demonstrate GPCR activation.",

For antagonist dose response, cells were first pre-incubated for 10 min in serum-free DMEM containing different concentrations of propranolol at room temperature. Then 1 \u00b5mol/L of isoproterenol was added and incubated for another 5 min at 37 \u00b0C. CCF4/AM was then loaded to perform the \u03b2-lactamase assay.

The agonist effect could be inhibited by the \u03b22AR antagonist, propranolol. When preincubated with propranolol, the percentage of cells that emitted blue fluorescence after agonist stimulation was similar to untreated cells (Figure 2A , middle and bottom).

Four wells (A1, B1, G12, and H12) were designed for reagent control to calculate the blue/green ratio for the demonstration of \u03b2-lactamase activity. The Z' factor was 0.68 in our experiment ( Figure 3A ).

As shown in Figure 3B , three fractions each exhibited a significant effect on the induction of \u03b2-lactamase activity (>40%). The effect of the other fractions on the induction of \u03b2-lactamase complementation is also shown in Figure 3 .

Three positive hits were further validated with the melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) cell line, which was also generated based on the \u03b2-lactamase complementation assay. As expected, they all had no agonist effect on the MC4R cell line ( Figure S1 ). \u03b22-adrenoceptor is a classic G-protein-coupled receptor used for investigation. Once the ligand binds to a \u03b22-adrenoceptor, the receptor will change the conformation and couple to a heterotrimeric G-protein, resulting in an elevation of cAMP levels. Thus, hits obtained from the primary screening were also validated with another functional assay to measure the induction of cAMP expression. As shown in Figure 4B , three fractions had nearly the same intensity of cAMP induction as the positive control, isoproterenol. These two experiments confirm the effect of the three fractions on \u03b22-adrenoceptor activation. Three positive fractions were consecutively obtained from Fructus Aurantii Immaturus. HPLC chromatograms of fractions 10-B11, 10-C11, and 10-D11 are shown in Figure 5 .

Detection of \u03b2-lactamase activity recovery with CCF4/AM could be observed and imaged in intact cells by a fluorescence microscope. This system is also adapted for sorting or analyzing by flow cytometry. The two fragments of \u03b2-lactamase are only about 10 kDa and 19 kDa. They are relatively smaller than many other tag proteins, and their size decreases the possibility of altering the function of chimeric fusion proteins. The small size, monomeric characteristic, and availability of a cellpermeable fluorescent substrate suggest that a system based on the \u03b2-lactamase enzyme complementation has wide potential in biological studies and drug discovery. GPCR activation leads to signal transduction through two mediators: G-proteins and \u03b2-arrestins. Agonists bind to GPCR and activate heterotrimeric G-proteins. This activation promotes second-messenger signaling and subsequently regulates different physiological functions. Another pathway for GPCR signal transduction is mediated by \u03b2-arrestins. The activated receptors can be phosphorylated by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases and recruit \u03b2-arrestins, which terminate signal transduction through G-proteins. Receptors move into clathrin-coated pits with \u03b2-arrestins from cell membranes, which cause receptor internalization and desensitization. Meanwhile, \u03b2-arrestins also serve as a scaffold for numerous signaling molecules that are stimulated by receptor agonists, which initiate a second parallel set of signals [27] . Traditionally, it was thought that ligand binding stimulated or inhibited all receptor functions to an equal extent, but in recent years, researchers have found \"biased ligands\" in many GPCRs [28] [29] [30] . Perfect biased ligands stimulate one receptor activity without stimulating other known receptor activity. The development of \u03b2-arrestin-biased ligands might provide opportunities for novel therapies [31] . Our cell-based model provided a tool for the measurement of agonist-promoted interactions between GPCRs and \u03b2-arrestins. Along with assays that measure second-messenger production (for example, Ca 2+ or cAMP), our model remains promising in the search for a biased ligand specific to the GPCR signal pathway that can activate only G-protein-or \u03b2-arrestins-mediated signal transduction.",
