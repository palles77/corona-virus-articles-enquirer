Otters are widely spread through Portugal, and scats have been extensively used in ecology studies; however, valid information on their microbiota is scarce. This work represents a first approach to characterise the otter faecal microflora in samples collected in river stretches of the Sado river basin (Portugal) during winter 2006. Eight sampling stretches of 8 km were selected, and from each, six to eight sampling sites were visited. A total of 31 scats were analysed. The microflora studied included aerobic bacteria, spore-forming anaerobic bacteria and viruses (coronavirus, parvovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus). Bacterial isolates were identified based on morphology and metabolic pathways, and virus detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction. The results revealed the high degree of bacterial diversity in the faecal microflora of L. lutra. A total of 88 Gram-negative (23 genera) and 44 Gram-positive isolates (ten genera) were identified. The identification of four isolates was inconclusive, and their identification was performed by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequencing, which confirms the need for biochemical testing optimisation regarding animal isolates. None of the scats was positive for virus detection. Identification of otter faecal microflora and of potential pathogens is an important first step towards understanding and monitoring their importance in otter population health.",

In winter of 2006, these sampling sites were surveyed at sunrise, for 5 consecutive days, assuring that sample collection was performed within 15 h from deposition by the otter. Otter scats are easily recognisable to the trained eye and are usually deposited by the otter in prominent places as marking activity for territory defence. Scats collected at the river stretches might be from the same individual, but scats from different river stretches are probably not. Among 119 scats collected, 31 were randomly selected on site and processed for microflora analysis (Table 1) , being the remaining used in diet assessment and in the molecular identification of individual otters (data not shown).

We aimed at investigating microbial diversity of the otter's faecal flora, as they are well spread in this country, being found in Photorhabdus luminescens 99 a wide range of aquatic environments. Although culturedbased methods applied for faecal bacteriological examination have several limitations (Leser et al. 2002) , as there are no data available on the microbiota of the Portuguese otter, we have chosen not to apply selective media or to perform PCR-based analysis, which would restrict microbiota characterisation. Harmsen et al. (1999) have already stated that molecular biology methods are sometimes insufficient for characterisation of faecal bacteria and provide no information on viability of microorganisms. Nevertheless, it should be noticed that fastidious bacteria, like Mycobacterium sp., would be lost in our study and acid-fast staining does not provide accurate results.

No association was found between diet and microflora. The distribution of the isolates should also be taken in consideration. Our study describes the cultivable aerobic and anaerobic spore-forming bacteria from 31 scats, and we do not believe that this sample size may be representative of the otter faecal flora, especially to differentiate between a fully established bacterial community and transient microorganisms.

The presence of antibodies against feline and canine virus was already referred by other authors in river otters, indicating their susceptibility to viral infection. A vast number of pathogen sequences are available for amplification from faecal material (Kohn and Wayne 1997) . None of the samples was positive for the viral nucleic acids tested in this work. CPIV, CAD1, CAD2 and CPV are eliminated in the stools and persist in the environment for long periods because of their resistance to adverse climatic conditions (Greene 1990) . The negativity to all three viruses in the processed stool samples indicates that these animals were not excreting the virus at the time of collection. Infection by Parvovirus is more frequent in the beginning of spring and through out the summer (Greene 1990 ). The Adenovirus and Parainfluenza virus are ubiquitous, but their pathogenic impact is higher in populations with high animal density, which is not the case with the Eurasian otter, as they are solitary territorial animals. Further studies should investigate if this negativity is related to the time of collection, as the PCR inhibitors that are usually encountered in faeces (Kohn and Wayne 1997) were eliminated by the DNA extraction method. Amplification of short DNA segments (from 187 to 704 bp) also results in more consistent amplifications, eliminating the possibility of no amplification because of the fact that DNA in faeces is present in low copy numbers or degraded (Kohn and Wayne 1997) . The success of DNA extraction was also improved by the collection of scats at sunrise, to assure their freshness.",
