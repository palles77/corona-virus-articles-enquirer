            "text": "BANK1, an adaptor protein expressed in B-cells, plays a little understood role in B-cell signaling. Because BANK1 contains an N-terminal putative Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain, we used mouse Bank1 \u2212/\u2212 splenic B cells to test if BANK1 affects signaling induced by the TLR9 agonist CpG. Following CpG stimulation BANK1 deficiency reduced p38 phosphorylation without affecting that of ERK or JNK and reduced IL-6 secretion. Bank1 \u2212/\u2212 B cells showed reduced phosphorylation of MNK1/2 and eIF4E, suggesting an effect on translation initiation, while Bank1 \u2212/\u2212 had no effect on IL6 mRNA stability, thus suggesting that BANK1 has no effect on MK2 signaling. IL-6 secretion observed when CpG stimulation was combined with anti-CD40, was reduced in the absence of BANK1. While in the presence of anti-CD40 stimulation CpG induced a stronger phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR and 4E-BP1, Bank1 \u2212/\u2212 had no effect on phosphorylation of mTOR and 4E-BP1, and weakly on AKT, implying that BANK1 does not affect the release of eIF4E by phospho-4E-BP1. Together these data establish a previously unrecognized role for BANK1 in CpG-induced responses by splenic B cells on p38 signaling and control of translation initiation of IL-6 via MNK1/2 and eIF4E.",

Consistent with this hypothesis, our recent studies have shown that exon 2 of human BANK1 encodes a highly hydrophobic domain, which renders the protein susceptible to aggregation (3); scaffold and adaptor proteins are known to form complex structures to facilitate intracellular signaling at the proper time and differentiation stage. Furthermore, exon 2 also encodes a predicted N-terminal toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain that is shared by BCAP (4) and used in the interaction of BCAP with the adaptors MyD88 and TIRAP. TLR9 is the major endosomal TLR in B cells that recognizes viral nucleic acids, and TLR9 signaling is believed to have an important role in autoimmunity (5) . TLR9 signaling is stimulated by hypomethylated DNA oligonucleotides or CpG (6) , leading to a pro-inflammatory response (7) .",

When we investigated production of IL-6 by combining anti-CD40 and CpG, we clearly observed that the amount of IL-6 secreted was importantly increased when adding anti-CD40 to CpG as compared to CpG alone in Bank1 +/+ B cells. Deficiency of BANK1 reduced the levels of secreted IL-6 ( Figure 2A) . We tested if stimulation with CpG would lead to a reduction in cell viability by BANK1 deficient cells and hence to reduced IL-6 secretion. This was not the case (Supplementary Figure S1A) . We did observe slightly fluctuated cell viability when combining CpG with anti-CD40 in BANK1 deficient cells, but proliferation was normal.

CpG-stimulated Bank1 +/+ and Bank1 \u2212/\u2212 splenic B-cells showed comparable Il6 mRNA stability ( Figure 4B ). Next, we tested the effects of BANK1 on the activation of the p38-MNK1/2-mediated signaling pathway. MNK1/2 regulates the translation initiation factor eIF4E through phosphorylation (26, 29, 30) . We therefore analyzed phosphorylation of MNK1/2 and eIF4E. CpG-induced MNK1/2 and eIF4E phosphorylation were consistently reduced in Bank1 \u2212/\u2212 cells ( Figure 4C and D) .",

In addition, stimulation through CD40 has been reported to lead to increased AKT phosphorylation in Bank1 \u2212/\u2212 purified B cells (31) . The cascade was induced with CpG alone (Figure 5A) , and the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR and 4E-BP1 was strongly induced when anti-CD40 was included alone or in combination with CpG ( Figure 5B and C) .

We have shown that mRNA stability of IL6 is not affected, nor the second axis of regulation of translation initiation via AKT, which is also induced by CpG and strongly amplified with anti-CD40 treatment. Clearly, the combination of CpG and anti-CD40 treatment leads to stronger signaling of the AKT axis followed by strong activation of mTOR and 4E-BP1. However absence of BANK1 has no effect on the signaling pathway through this axis, except weak activation of AKT. While the secretion of IL-6 is optimal (22, 23, 32) with the combination of CpG and anti-CD40, BANK1 deficiency leads to its reduction, and anti-CD40 cannot overcome this effect. Our results clearly show that overall BANK1 controls the production of IL-6 via the p38-MNK1/2-eIF4E pathway. At the same time, activation of the CD40-induced pathway leads to strong phosphorylation of the AKT axis, which would eventually promote translation initiation of IL-6 through phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the release of eIF4E for it to become phosphorylated by MNK1/2.

B cell-derived IL-6 was necessary and sufficient to induce IL-21 from CD4+ T cells in vitro and to support T FH cell development in vivo upon acute influenza virus infection (39) . IL-6 is also involved in the induction but not maintenance of plasma cells (40) . BANK1 deficient mice have normal T cell-dependent humoral responses following immunization with NP-CGG (31). One explanation for the unchanged primary humoral response reported by Aiba et al. in Bank1\u2212/\u2212 mice is likely to be the lack of TLR agonist challenge and IL-6 production by B cells in their in vivo system. Therefore, it will be worth to address if infection with DNA-or RNA-viruses, instead of NP-CGG immunization can initiate TLR9 or TLR7 activation that would probably result in reduced IL-6 production by Bank1\u2212/\u2212 B cells, and suppressed germinal center responses. Regarding humoral responses, at this point we are unable to explain the tendency towards increased IgG2a/2c production induced by CpG and we do not know if this bears any relationship with the increased serum IgG2a observed by Aiba et al (31) .",

BCAP is required for TLR-mediated activation of PI3K and AKT in macrophages (4) . In contrast, CpG-induced AKT activation is normal in Bank1\u2212/\u2212 B cells ( Figure 5A ). The data suggest that BCAP, rather than BANK1, may play a critical role in TLR-mediated activation of AKT, and further, BCAP and CD19 have complementary roles in BCR-mediated-PI3K activation (41) . While BANK1 appears to mediate AKT activation upon CD40 ligation in B cells ((31) and Figure 5B ), our results support a specific role for BANK1 in transducing CpG-induced signals via p38-MNK1/2 and the translation initiation factor eIF4E in B cells. Thus, BANK1 and BCAP rather than playing redundant roles, appear to have very different ones. BANK1, with a putative TIR domain, would be prone to bind molecules containing TIR domains, and explain the very specific role of BANK1 in p38 signaling and translation initiation. BANK1 is an adaptor molecule with a modular structure. It has up to 23 tyrosines susceptible of phosphorylation, and their substrate could alternate among a variety of molecules forming specific complexes during CpG-induced activation, different from those occurring following BCR-induced ligation, for instance. One of those complexes induced by CpG could include p38. How BANK1 controls the p38-MNK1/2 pathway downstream of TLR9 is at present not known, but is a subject of study in our laboratory.",
