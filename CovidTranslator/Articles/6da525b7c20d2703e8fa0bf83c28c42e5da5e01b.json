We must find solutions to these combined challenges by taking into account the need for proper human nutrition and health, wildlife conservation, and environmental resilience. An example of a holistic conservation medicine program is well demonstrated by our work focused on camel health in the shifting landscape of Northern Kenya. In fact, the changing demographics of people and their livestock in this region may have immediate and longstanding negative implications for sympatric wildlife species. These changes demand a conservation medicine approach.",

The invitation was from colleagues working at MRC and Novus International, an animal nutrition company with headquarters near St. Louis, MO. After researchers embarked on camel nutrition studies, they soon realized that little data existed on the health status of, and disease risks for, camels in Kenya. (This was just before Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS-CoV] was on the international stage with the first detection of MERS-CoV in a 25-year-old student in Jordan. 21 See also chapter in this volume: An Overview of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the Middle East.) We at the Saint Louis Zoo immediately accepted this opportunity because the ICM had just launched as a new Zoo department, and one of the Zoo's WildCare Institute conservation centers had been focusing efforts on wildlife conservation in the Horn of Africa for many years prior to this time.",

First was the task of gathering literature on dromedary camel health and diseases, and to consider these in a conservation medicine framework. We focused on the diseases that were of most concern for camel productivity and human health, as well as diseases transmissible across the camel-livestockhuman-wildlife interface. Dromedary camels may harbor agents with zoonotic potential (e.g., Coxiella burnetii, Brucella spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Rift Valley fever, anthrax) and/or those that may be transmitted only among camels, other livestock and wildlife (e.g., blue tongue, bovine diarrhea virus, Trypanosoma evansi). [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] It was also clear that some of these diseases (e.g., Brucella spp.) are difficult to diagnose in camels.",

First, with just one camel milk pasteurization plant in the country, Kenyans have little access to pasteurized milk. It has been estimated that 10% of Kenya's 40 million people drink unpasteurized camel milk. 11 Because raw camel milk is a possible transmission route for many microorganisms, the consumption of unpasteurized camel milk in Kenya may pose a high public health cost in the country. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Secondly, camels are browsers and have great ability to cover large areas across the landscape, which may lead to competition for food with sympatric wildlife. 16 Lastly, there remains a shortage of veterinary education for camel health and a lack of veterinary support for camel production in the country. As a relatively new large-scale production livestock species in Kenya, and as a species often viewed as most closely linked with marginalized people, veterinary care and biosecurity for camels in Kenya significantly lags behind that for more traditional livestock (e.g., cattle, sheep, goats). This lack of care has potentially devastating implications for productivity losses related to disease-associated morbidity and mortality, as well as an increase in disease transmission between camels, other livestock, wildlife, and humans. All these factors and challenges demand a conservation medicine approach.",

We also focused much of our work on C. burnetii, because the original literature review indicated that Q fever was an emerging infectious disease (EID) in Kenya, and that during recent years it had been causing significant disease in Kenyans. 34 However, with little known on the epidemiology of the disease in Kenya, we elected to explore the possible role of camels. Our studies have demonstrated a high seroprevalence to Q fever in camels, and the potential role they may serve as reservoirs of the bacteria, with implications for cross-species transmission between livestock, sympatric wildlife, and humans. 35, 36 Rather serendipitously and shortly after we had started working with camels, the emergence of MERS-CoV in the Middle East, with spread to other regions of the world, was a catalyst for the development of this conservation medicine program. The use of samples we had collected and bio-banked in the initial years and just prior to MERS-CoV being on the world stage provided an important source of data for understanding this significant EID in the region. 37 Lastly, a large part of our camel program in Kenya has been the training of next generation conservation medicine practitioners through involvement in a real-life public health and wildlife conservation program. 19 This has included students from Kenya, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Through this program, we have trained DVM, MSc, and public health students and provided them experiences in which they gain an appreciation for the disease risks associated with changing environmental conditions, protein sources for humans, and the inevitable increase in interactions at the domestic animal/wildlife/ human interface.",

Some may question why a zoological institution and zoological veterinarian took the lead on developing a program for a \"domestic livestock\" species. However, when viewed at the intersection of camel, livestock, wildlife, and human health and disease concerns, this is the type of program zoos should increasingly embrace. Zoological veterinarians are first and foremost veterinarians; we have an ability to partner with public health colleagues, and zoos are working to increase their \"fence to field\" reach to work for the conservation of wildlife species, while ensuring human livelihoods and health are not compromised. 17, 19 As previously stated, 38 one solution to disease and conservation at the wild-domestic animal interface is the implementation of a proactive approach-addressing po tential pathogen transmission before a volatile problem occurs.
