Mutagenesis analysis indicate that the length of the CVB3 3 0 -poly(A) is determined by the oriR, a cis-element in the 3 0 -noncoding region of viral RNA. In contrast, while mutations of the oriR inhibit initiation of (\u00c0) RNA synthesis, they do not affect the 5 0 -poly(U) length. Poly(A)-lacking genomes are able to acquire genetically unstable AU-rich poly(A)-terminated 3 0 -tails, which may be generated by a mechanism distinct from the cognate viral RNA polyadenylation. The aberrant tails ensure only inefficient replication. The possibility of RNA replication independent of oriR and poly(A) demonstrate that highly debilitated viruses are able to survive by utilizing 'emergence', perhaps atavistic, mechanisms.",

In contrast to cellular mRNAs, in which poly(A) is non-templated and is added posttranscriptionally, the viral poly(A) is believed to be templatecoded (1) . Accordingly, the negative strand contains a 5 0 -poly(U) tract, which is synthesized using the poly(A) of the positive viral RNA as a template. In turn, this poly(U) subsequently serves as a template for the synthesis of the poly(A) of progeny RNA. This alternate usage of the homopolymeric parts of the (+) and (\u00c0) RNA for each strand synthesis has not been studied in detail but it was observed that poly(U) in the negative RNA of poliovirus (2, 3) and coronavirus (4) may be shorter than poly(A) in the viral RNAs. These observations pose intriguing questions about how a shorter poly(U) is synthesized on a longer poly(A) template and vice versa.",

This complex is thought to be involved in the switch that represses translation and allows replication to commence (9) , and is also required for the initiation of both (+)-strand (6) and (\u00c0)-strand RNA synthesis.

Positive-strand RNA synthesis is initiated at the 3 0 -end of the (\u00c0) strand but the detailed mechanism is unknown. It has been proposed that destabilization and partial unwinding of this end of the duplex is required for efficient replication (32, 33) . Transcription of the (+)-strands from the (\u00c0)-RNA template results in partially double-stranded 'replicative intermediate' RNA molecules consisting of full-length (\u00c0) RNA and various numbers of incomplete (+) strands differing in length (5) . Newly synthesized virion RNAs are thought to be displaced from the (\u00c0) strands by upcoming progeny strands through the duplex-unwinding activity of the viral RNA polymerase 3D pol (34) . However, a number of important issues pertaining to picornavirus genome replication remain contradictory or unsolved (35) .",

While ensuring efficient negative strand initiation, the oriR does not control the poly(U) length. Removal of the poly(A) (alone or together with the oriR) from transfected viral RNA resulted in regeneration of poly(A)-containing 3 0 -tails, which, however, ensured only inefficient viral reproduction.

One can hypothesize that this mechanism involves the oriR. To examine this, two mutant RNAs, N70/A and N70/B, were generated, in which oriR was replaced by random sequences of 70 nt (Table 1) . These RNAs proved to be viable but exhibited a reduced rate of replication [cytopathic effect (CPE) developed 4-6 days after transfection versus 2 days in the case of wild-type (wt) transcripts].

Luciferase-expressing CVB3 replicons with the 3 0 NCR replaced by the randomized RNA segments were assayed for RF accumulation in a cell-free system. The assay was performed with RNA transcripts containing two 5 0 -terminal non-viral G residues (originating from T7 RNA polymerase promoter), which suppressed (+) strand RNA synthesis, allowing thereby estimation of the (\u00c0) strand synthesis (14, 38) . Randomization of oriR resulted in a severe deficiency in RF accumulation ( Figure 2C ), suggesting impairment of the (\u00c0) strand initiation. OriR randomization also inhibited RNA replication in BGM cells, as determined by using luciferase-expressing CVB3 replicons ( Figure 2D ). The replicon RNAs used to transfect BGM cells contained authentic 5 0 -ends (owing to the presence of a ribozyme sequence), improving replication kinetics (14, 38) .

The pseudoreversions exhibited by the viruses could be grouped into two types. The representative of one class acquired a mutation restoring potential for a stable, though altered, kissing interaction. Thus, a C insertion at position 7350 could potentially support an alternative 6 nt kissing interaction ( Figure 3D ). When this mutation was engineered into the KD1 RNA, a virus (KD1+C) exhibiting a nearly wt phenotype was obtained, as judged by plaque size, singlecycle growth, cell-free RF formation and luciferase expression in transfected BGM cells (data not shown).

To investigate the significance of these domains, deletions of either X or Y, or both, or the entire heteropolymeric 3 0 NCR were engineered into the CVB3 RNA. The separate deletions of X or Y were engineered into p53CB3/T7 RNA, whereas more extended deletions were introduced into pRibCB3/T7, which was found to be more infectious owing to the presence of the hammerhead ribozyme sequence (14, 38) . All constructs tested had a poly(A) of 30 nt and generated CPE in transfected culture, though with a significant delay ( Table 2) . Recovered viruses retained the engineered mutations and did not acquire any additional changes within the 3 0 NCR. In the D3 0 NCR and DXY mutants, the entire genome and P3 region were sequenced, respectively, and no additional mutations were found. All these mutants exhibited a marked deficiency in the virus reproduction ( Figure 4A ) and a small plaque-phenotype ( Figure 4B ) as well as inefficient cell-free RF accumulation ( Figure 4C ) and RNA replication in BGM cells ( Figure 4D ). The mutations were also accompanied with a severe reduction in poly(A) length, to $45 nt (DX), $30 nt (DY) and $20 nt (D3 0 NCR) ( Figure 4E ). The deletion of the Z-domain alone had no significant impact on poly(A) length. These results confirmed that efficient viral RNA replication requires an oriR with a sufficiently stable kissing interaction, although the sequence of the K-domain could vary. Also, the efficient initiation of the (\u00c0) strand and generation of long poly(A) tails in the progeny (+)RNA could not be supported by its individual domains. shorter poly(A) resulted in a dead or highly debilitated virus (2, 10, 31, 40) .",

The Dpoly(A) construct contained 3 0 -terminal TCGA derived from a SalI site at the linearization locus.

The RNA of the recovered Dpoly(A) mutant corresponded to its DNA construct, whereas the poly(G) moiety of the G 23 mutant lost 21-22 G-residues and the C 9 G moiety of the respective mutant was replaced by a CCUUU sequence (Table 1) .

Destruction of the oriR, a ciselement in the 3 0 NCR of genomic RNA, significantly reduces the poly(A) size and decreases the efficiency of (\u00c0) RNA synthesis but does not affect the poly(U) length. Even though efficient genome replication requires the presence of a poly(A) of at least $20 nt, its complete removal did not kill the virus because of the poly(A) capacity to regenerate.

            "text": "The existence of a longer poly(A) compared with its poly(U) template indicates that polyadenylation of viral RNA is not limited to the faithful copying of the template. Theoretically, additional polyadenylation may be because of either reiterative usage of the poly(U) template or a non-templated reaction catalyzed by a terminal nucleotide transferase (TNT)-like enzyme or poly(A) polymerase. Since the poly(A) is markedly shortened in the absence of oriR, the mechanism should involve this cis-element. The reiterative hypothesis ( Figure 6A ) assumes that the synthesis of a longer poly(A) is due to a kind of 'stuttering' of the viral polymerase, common to negative-strand RNA viruses (41, 42) . The oriR role may be envisioned as follows. The nascent oriR, just released from the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) molecule engaged in the 5 0 -poly(U) copying, interacts with this RdRP in cis (43) and 'encourages' it to repeatedly use the poly(U) template. The RdRP/oriR interaction may be aided by other cellular (44) or viral proteins (45) . Cases of increase in the length of internal oligo(A) in poliovirus (23, 46) and foot-and-mouth disease virus (47) RNAs support the possibility of reiterative copying during picornavirus RNA replication. In this model, additional polyadenylation of viral RNA is replication-coupled, which is compatible with relative inefficiency of the RdRP complementation in trans (48, 49) .",

Such nucleotide preference might reflect peculiarities of a yet-to-be-defined tailing reaction or merely resulted from selection because other types of tails might confer a lesser fitness. Mechanisms of elongation of the RNAs lacking poly(A) [or poly(A) and At least for the cases, where the engineered RNA did not possess an appropriate oligoadenylate to bind, or to generate, the VPg-pUpU primer [e.g. D3 0 NCR-N70-Dpoly(A) and D3 0 NCR-N111-Dpoly(A)], it is likely that some tailing of the viral RNA occurred prior to its use as a template for the (\u00c0) strand. Such tailing may involve a TNT-like enzyme of viral or host origin or non-replicative recombination (46, 57, 58) , or both. Participation of recombination is supported by the observed inclusion of apparently host-derived sequences identical to a part of the human heterogeneous nuclear RNP U mRNA (residues 2408-2437) into the acquired 3 0 -tails upon passages (data not shown).",

It is unknown whether they appear just by chance or are selected because they promote recruitment of the host polyadenylation machinery. A possible contribution of the AAUAAA signals to the appearance of oligo(A) stretches in the aberrant 3 0 -tails of the viral RNA is supported by the finding that the addition of this signal restored viability of D3 0 NCR-N70-Dpoly(A) RNA (Table 2) . Also in Bamboo Mosaic Virus it was shown that this hexameric sequence is involved in genomic RNA polyadenylation (59) . Furthermore, treatment of human cells with siRNAs specific for the cellular polyA polymerase resulted in downregulation of the enzyme and inhibition of poliovirus replication (C. Polacek and R. Andino, unpublished data). The origin of the poly(U) blocks in the (+) RNA molecules is enigmatic. It cannot be excluded that they are also due to a TNT-like activity. Remarkably, these segments are often located upstream of the 3 0 -poly(A). Hence, if tailing occurs at the level of viral RNA, the 3 0 -poly(A) may be added by snapback synthesis on poly(U) blocks. However, the scarcity of experimental data makes such notion rather speculative.",

Second, oriR belongs to a class of cis-elements, which are important but not essential. It is tempting to assume that such elements could have been acquired at some steps of enterovirus evolution in order to increase viral fitness. If so, the oriR-lacking mutants could be regarded as relying on ancient, 'atavistic' replicative tools. Regeneration of poly(A) after its complete deletion suggests the existence of unspecific mechanisms, which may 'revive' nearly dead viruses. Some of these mechanisms perhaps involve host enzymes.",

During the synthesis of a (+) RNA strand on a (\u00c0) RNA template, the nascent oriR just released from the RdRP molecule interacts with this RdRP in cis and 'encourages' it to repeatedly use the poly(U) template. (B) The post-replicative terminal adenylation model. The oriR of a newly synthesized (+) RNA [having a $20 nt-long poly(A)] binds and activates an enzyme with the adenylate transferase activity of viral or host origin, which accomplishes poly(A) elongation. (C) The post-translational terminal adenylation model. Viral RNA with a short poly(A), being translated, generates, among other proteins, the RdRP, which binds in cis the nearby oriR just liberated from the ribosome. This binding activates the enzyme intrinsic adenylate transferase activity. 3 0 NCR] are not necessarily the same as those operating in the case of wt viruses.",
