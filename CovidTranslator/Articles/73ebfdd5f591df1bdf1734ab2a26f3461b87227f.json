            "text": "Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein-1 (LRG) is a serum glycoprotein of unknown function that has shown promise based on qualitative assessments as a biomarker for certain diseases including microbial infections and cancer. However, the lack of a quantitative assay for LRG has limited its application. Here an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for quantifying LRG in human serum is described in which cytochrome c is employed as the capturing ligand and a monoclonal antibody specific for LRG is used to detect the captured glycoprotein. Application of this assay in quantifying LRG in various patients' sera is demonstrated. The concentration of LRG in sera of control subjects as determined by this assay is approximately 50 \u03bcg/ml. Consistent with expectations from published reports, LRG was found to be significantly elevated in the sera of some patients with a bacterial infection (toxic shock syndrome, TSS). LRG was only slightly elevated in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus as compared to uninfected control subjects, while normal levels of LRG were observed in patients with non-infectious diseases (inflammatory arthritis and neurological disorders, primarily Parkinson's disease). Although LRG and C-reactive protein (CRP) are both produced by the liver and are classified as acute-phase proteins, there was no significant correlation between the levels of LRG and CRP in the sera of the patients. Thus, LRG and CRP measurements are non-redundant and indicate different physiological contexts. The ELISA described in this report should be useful to further assess serum LRG as a biomarker for clinical diagnostics.",

            "text": "Evaluation of serum components is one of the least invasive approaches to clinical diagnosis and prognosis. There is considerable potential to exploit this approach even further than at present. Indeed, the impact of a number of serum proteins in disease diagnosis and prognosis is not fully known, limited in large part by the availability of rapid, quantitative assays. A case in point is the serum glycoprotein leucine-richalpha-2-glycoprotein-1 (LRG). LRG was first purified from human serum in 1977 (Haupt and Baudner, 1977) and its amino acid sequence was determined 8 years later (Takahashi et al., 1985) . The glycoprotein has a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa and contains 23% carbohydrate by weight (Haupt and Baudner, 1977) . It is comprised of repetitive sequences with a leucine-rich motif and leucine residues make up 17% of the amino acid composition (Takahashi et al., 1985) . Based on mRNA analysis, LRG is predicted to be expressed by liver cells (NCBI GDS 182, GDS 423, and GDS 2068) and by neutrophils (O'Donnell et al., 2002) and is up-regulated in a mouse model of inflammation (Norkina et al., 2004) . The function of LRG is not known, although it has been shown to bind cytochrome c (Cyt c; Cummings et al., 2006) and has been hypothesized to play a role in cell survival (Thompson et al., 2007) .",

For adsorption on DEAE-Sephacel (40 ml; Sigma-Aldrich Chem. Co., St. Louis, MO) the supernate from 50% ammonium sulfate precipitation of serum was dialyzed against 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Stepwise two-fold increases in sodium chloride concentration beginning at 40 mM resulted in the elution of human LRG at 160 mM sodium chloride. The eluate containing LRG was adsorbed to 1 ml horse Cyt c-Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA), washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS, 3 \u00d7 10 ml), and eluted stepwise with 4 ml 0.05 M acetic acid followed by 0.5 M acetic acid. The 0.05 M acetic acid eluate which contained approximately 80% of the LRG was lyophilized, dissolved in 200 \u03bcl 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, dialyzed against 1 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, and passed through 200 \u03bcl of hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad) to remove any acidic proteins that may have bound to the Cyt c-Affi-Gel 10 column due to electrostatic interactions (Haupt and Baudner, 1977) . Protein purity was assessed by Gel Code Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels (4 to 20% acrylamide gradient; Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). The concentration of LRG was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm assuming an extinction coefficient (1 mM) of 32.8 as calculated from the amino acid composition (Gill and von Hippel, 1989) .",

Nevertheless, to assess whether Cyt c or some other component in serum might bind LRG and interfere with its quantification in the ELISA, serum (diluted to 10% in PBS) was passed through a 1 ml column of Sepharose beads to which the LRG-specific mAb was covalently bound and adsorbed proteins were eluted in 0.5 M acetic acid, then electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE. The complex of purified LRG and Cyt c, formed in vitro using purified LRG and Cyt c in a molar ratio of 4:1, was effectively adsorbed by the mAb-coupled beads ( Fig. 2A) . In this experiment the molar ratio of Cyt c to LRG in the bound complex was calculated to be 0.7 based on the extinction coefficients of the two proteins at 410 nm and 280 nm. When the concentration of Cyt c relative to LRG in the incubation solution was increased to 20 fold, the molar ratio of the two components in the complex approached 1.0 (results not shown).",

Our previous finding that LRG binds Cyt c (Cummings et al., 2006) and that LRG competes with Apaf-1 for binding Cyt c (Thompson et al., 2007) suggest that LRG may be an antiapoptotic factor allowing survival of cells in response to stress signals. In support of this hypothesis, the LRG gene is upregulated in lung and muscle cells within 24 to 48 h following exposure to poisons (NCBI GDS 234, GDS 1244) and then it is downregulated by 72 h LRG and Apaf-1 mRNAs are also inversely expressed in many tissues in the mouse including the liver, suggesting opposing functions (NCBI GDS 2068). In regard to cancer, LRG mRNA expression was found to be elevated in 5 of 10 ovarian cancer cell lines examined, consistent with an increase in serum LRG in at least half of ovarian cancer patients (NCBI GDS 1523). It remains to be determined whether LRG in sera of cancer patients is produced by the cancer cells or some other tissues, such as the liver or neutrophils. In their study of pancreatic cancer, Kakisaka et al. reported that cultured pancreatic cancer cells did not secrete LRG. LRG was also not observed in cells infected with the coronavirus causing SARS (Jiang et al., 2005). The elevated LRG in serum could result from the body's defense against cancer or could be a reaction of the liver to serum factors increased in response to cancer.",

If elevated serum LRG results from the body's defense against cancer, then high LRG levels may bode well for patients. However, if circulating LRG levels are associated with cancer cell survival, then a poor prognosis may be indicated. The sandwich ELISA described herein should be a useful tool to assess these and other questions in future clinical trials.",
