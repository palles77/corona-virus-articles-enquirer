The multidimensional perspectives of sustainability such as economy, society, environment, combined with a lack of structured methodology and information at various hierarchical levels, further exacerbate the problem. This paper (Part 1 of a two-part series) proposes an analytical decision model and a structured methodology for sustainability appraisal in infrastructure projects. The paper uses the Fweighted sum model_ technique in multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and the Fadditive utility model_ in analytical hierarchical process (AHP) for multicriteria decision making, to develop the model from first principles. It discusses the development of key performance indicators encapsulated within the analytical model. It concludes by discussing other potential applications of the proposed model and methodology for process automation as part of integrated sustainability appraisal in infrastructure design and construction. Part 2 uses a case study to demonstrate the model application in infrastructure sustainability appraisal at design stages. The paper also discusses the challenges for sustainability research, and gives recommendations. D",

Various national governments have set up programmes in order to meet the objectives outlined following the Rio de Janeiro Summit in June 1992. The Rio summit culminated in resolutions such as the Rio Declarations on Environment and Agenda 21 [2], and was followed by the South African summit in 2002 [3] . However, the process of translating national strategic sustainability objectives into concrete action at micro (i.e., projectspecific)-levels is a difficult task. Inadequate understanding of the interactions and cumulative impacts of the various sub-level sustainability indicators further compound the difficulty in sustainability appraisal of designs. Thus, although there is increasing realisation of the need to design and construct for sustainability, the real challenge is on achieving these objectives at the micro-level.",

Examples of such macro-level policy-driven strategies can be found in the literature [8,9,22 -24,26] . Thus, while current sustainability initiatives, strategies, framework and processes focus on wider national aspirations and strategic 0926 objectives, they are noticeably weak in addressing microlevel integrated decision making.

This is because of a lack of integrated structured methodology and techniques for sustainability appraisal as part of infrastructure delivery (especially during design and construction). Such decisions are often predicated on their mental models of past projects, some of which may have been designed with very little or no consideration to sustainability issues. This approach will be referred to as metaphorical-based design. Although such metaphorical-based designs offer quick and easy solutions, they often stifle innovation (and even militate against the natural spirit of enquiry and experimentation), since decisions are simply based on tried alternatives that have worked in the past, but were not necessarily the most sustainable solution.",

As an illustration, Feconomy_ as a sustainability indicator encapsulates sub-elements such as direct/indirect costs (which further subsumes construction/operation costs), and other life cycle cost elements. Similarly, Fenvironment_ subsumes other sub-elements such as land use, water, air, noise, ecology, waste management, all of which are further subdivided into other finite sub-categories. Resource utilization includes indicators such as constructability, material availability and reusability among others. Moreover, there is complex interaction between these variables in project design and specification. Sections 4 and 5 discuss details of the indicators at various sub-levels. On the other hand, designers are imbued with generic tacit knowledge, which needs to be adequately harnessed, managed and deployed for use in collaborative design and specifications, as part of strategic organisational corporate knowledge management.",

Such design evaluation and appraisal would contribute to making better sustainabilitydriven decisions at the project levels. However, review of available literature indicates significant gaps in sustainability research. The major gap is to investigate how to guide designers and other stakeholders to translate strategic macro-level sustainability objectives into practical actions as part of the infrastructure delivery processes at the microlevel (i.e., design and construction) [5, 6] . This paper is envisaged to make a substantial contribution by addressing this identified research gap. It presents a methodology and computational processes (analytical models) that address the existing problem of designing for sustainability in infra-structure systems delivery in the Architecture/Engineering/ Construction (AEC) sector. The methodology and analytical model were validated using a mega-infrastructure project as a case study [48] .",

Three of these critical elements include (i) clear formulation and setting of objectives; (ii) identifying and evaluating alternatives in quantitative and/or qualitative terms; and (iii) effective implementation of a selected/ chosen alternative. In the broader context of sustainability of infrastructure systems, which is the focus of this paper, the strategic objectives are articulated at the macro-level to underpin national frameworks for achieving broader sustainable development including sustainable construction environment. The alternatives in (ii) are design options, while the implementation in (iii) translates to choosing appropriate construction methods and techniques including effective management processes to transform abstract designs, concepts, and specifications into concrete sustainable physical artefacts.",

It considers the environmental impacts of these variables over the product whole life cycle. Other related researches include group decision making [36, 37] , life cycle cost analysis [40] , multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) [38, 39] , and environmental management systems and tools [10, 27, 28] .

Another requirement in indicators development is that they be quantifiable and effective. Other basic characteristics of an indicator include (i) relevance-it must be relevant, and fit the purpose for performance measurement, (ii) understandable-it should be easily understandable to all present and future users. This means that there has to be shared common understanding of terms and definition of the indicators (i.e., ontology), without loss of meaning; and (iii) it must be usable by the community (stakeholders).",

This means that indicators for use in sustainability appraisal of infrastructure projects should be chosen to suit the characteristics of civil projects. A corollary here is that indicators used for building structures may not be fully compatible with assessing civil engineering infrastructure projects, since such indicators are projectspecific.

Part II of the questionnaire asked respondents to give a score from 1 to 5 against each of the selected indicators to determine their suitability in assessing sustainability of typical infrastructure projects.

Two invalid responses were also received from a contractor and a supplier company, who both left Part II blank.

This often culminates in the issuance of specific environmental permit before the project commences (for example in HKSAR). For such situations, sub-criteria under environment could be assigned the maximum numerical weight and other indicators assigned less weight as appropriate for the evaluation. In mathematical terms, the measure of performance of a given alternative D i in terms of a main sustainability criterion Sc j is given by d i,j (for i = 1, 2, 3, . . . M; j = 1, 2, 3 . . . N).

The underlying assumption here is the additive/commutative utility model. The contextual translation means that the total utility of a given design proposal (as measured by the sustainability index) depends on its individual utilities in the various decomposed elemental sustainability indicators (KPIs). This assumption holds for most extant theories of utility and is particularly true of the concept of ''generalised additivity.'' Also the use of weighted sum model assumes that the decision criteria can be expressed in the same unit of measure. This is achieved by using dimensionless numerical scores (i.e., scalar quantity) in the sustainability appraisal process. Let SI i (for i = 1, 2, 3. . . M) represent the final sustainability index (a crisp value), of design alternative D i when all the decision criteria d i,j are considered. The next problem is how to compute SI i . There are different MCDM methods such as weighted sum model (WSM), weighted product model (WPM), and the analytical hierarchical process (AHP). The references [17 -20] contain detailed description of these methods. This paper focuses on the weighted sum model because it is the most widely used MCDM method. It is also considered sufficient for formulating an underpinning mathematical model for quantitative sustainability appraisal. The decision is further buttressed by the fact that a review of some completed case study major projects and the application of MCDM techniques in practice indicates that the weighted sum model is widely used for practical decision making in real life situations. It is therefore considered valid enough to develop a mathematical foundation for sustainability appraisal.",

It reviewed current sustainability research and highlighted the existing problems and gaps. The problems are further compounded by an absence of a systematic approach to sustainability appraisal at microlevels. The research focused on investigating solutions to the problems engendered by lack of problem structuring. It emphasised that such problem structuring and systematic approaches are required in order to translate strategic sustainability objectives into project-specific concrete actions. The paper discussed the development of KPIs for infrastructure sustainability assessment using the proposed SUSAIP framework.",

The map demonstrates that constructability is critical to translate sustainability-driven design solutions into constructed facilities in practice. This is because any sustainable design decisions and/or specifications made in earlier stages could be changed into other unexpected forms at the construction stage due to constructability problems. However, the cognitive map illustrated that both early contractor involvement (ECI) and early supplier involvement (ESI) would minimise constructability-related problems including cost associated with delays, claims, wastage and rework etc. Moreover, some of the indicators are sitespecific and project-specific in nature. ECI and ESI give contractors and suppliers the opportunity to give advice and/or specific ideas earlier (example regarding route for dumping materials, noise or waste production of a specific plant) etc. The result of the questionnaire-based indicator validation with stakeholders shows that some indicators are vulnerable to the vagaries and changes in society's priorities. It raises some intergenerational issues in the context of temporal time -space dimensions of sustainability as a concept.",

It also incorporates other performance-based indicators such as health and safety, resource utilization and aspects related to project management all of which can be measured quantitatively during construction. Thus, the proposed SUSAIP framework can be used at various project stages including design, construction, operation Fig. 2 . A hierarchy of key performance indicators (KPI) and cognitive/reasoning map for infrastructure sustainability appraisal (adapted from Ref. [13] ). Key: --(dashed line) shows source -destination interaction between the indicators; + indicates increasing casual effect from source to destination; \u00c0 indicates decreasing casual effect from source to destination. and maintenance and demolition. The framework would enable designers to formulate strategies to design for sustainability by incorporating these depths of performance criteria. Design considerations would include (i) environmental impacts; (ii) innovative solutions that optimise the use of resources including designing for durability, constructability and deconstruction, (iii) material reuse, recycle and waste management, (iv) impact of design decisions on the wider ecosystem etc. and (v) innovative construction methods and technology. Specific design strategies to address construction technology include (i) reduction in waste generation by using prefabricated materials and (ii) reusing moulds and formwork by using steel moulds. The validated taxonomy of sustainability indicators would enable designers to comprehensively address these issues [13, 14] . Moreover, a complementary cognitive map such as the one discussed in Section 5.3 of this paper would further reduce cognitive load on designers so that they focus on other design tasks. The paper also proposed step-by-step processes and underpinning decision models for sustainability assessment. The mathematical models constitute the foundation for computational analysis in quantitative-based decision making, using a crisp value-the sustainability index. The proposed methodology and analytical models were validated using a mega-infrastructure project as a case study discussed in Part 2 [48] . This validation moves the SUSAIP framework beyond experimental formulations into practical application. The results and case study observations indicate huge potential applications of the model in practice. The methodology and computational models discussed could form a basis for process automation in the broader context of sustainability appraisal and organisational knowledge management [47] .",
