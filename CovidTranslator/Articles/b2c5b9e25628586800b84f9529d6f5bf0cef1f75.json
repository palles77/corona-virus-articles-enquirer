            "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and genetically complex inflammatory disorder that leads to erosive destruction of peripheral joints 1-5 . The use of animal models mimicking RA, such as pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in rats, should facilitate its genetic analysis. Pristane is a non-immunogenic synthetic oil that, after a single subcutaneous injection into DA rats, induces arthritis restricted to peripheral joints with a chronic relapsing disease course 6 . To identify genes involved in the control of chronic arthritis, we made crosses between susceptible DA rats and resistant E3 rats and analysed the progeny with microsatellite markers covering the entire rat genome. Our results show that different arthritis phenotypes are associated with different chromosomal loci. Loci on chromosomes 4 and 6 (Pia2 and Pia3) influence arthritis onset, whereas a locus on chromosome 12 (Pia4) is associated with severity and joint erosion. We found that chronicity is associated with a different set of loci, one on chromosome 4 and the other on chromosome 14 (Pia5, Pia6) . These findings demonstrate for the first time that different phases of a chronic self-perpetuative disease which mimics RA are associated with distinct sets of genes.",

It was found that the DA strain is highly susceptible to PIA, whereas the E3 strain is resistant, and that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region (Pia1) influences the chronicity of the disease. Moreover, analysis of recombinant inbred strains made from DA and E3 showed that the disease is polygenic. To map genes involved in PIA, we made F1 and F2 crosses between the E3 and the DA strains (Table 1) . F1 rats developed chronic PIA, indicating dominant genes, but with delayed onset (P<0.0001) and reduced severity (P<0.0001) compared with the DA parental rats, suggesting incomplete penetrance due to the presence of recessive and/or additive genes. Consistent with earlier reports 6 , females were more susceptible than males. In the F2 population, the disease course was more variable and examples of the different disease patterns are shown (Fig. 1 ). All 153 (E3\u00d7DA) F2 rats were subjected to a near-complete genome screen using a set of 330 informative microsatellites. The identified QTLs are summarized (Table 2) , and log-likelihood plots (Fig. 2 ) as well as chromosomal locations (Fig. 3 ) are shown.",

As in RA, the distribution of affected joints was predominantly symmetric (85% of the affected joints were symmetric at day 35). A locus on chromosome 6 (Pia3) was linked to the day of arthritis Days after pristane injection letter onset, but an indication of linkage was also found on chromosome 4; this linkage became significant (Pia2) when only females were analysed, despite the decrease in power by the reduced number of rats. This indicates that the gene is dependent on a female context. Both loci appear to control a delayed disease onset in a DA recessive mode (Fig. 4) ; that is, they contain disease susceptibility genes derived from E3. None of the loci controlling arthritis onset influenced further progression of the disease (Fig. 4) . A major locus (Pia4) was found on chromosome 12 that controls arthritis severity during the early period between day 20 and day 45 in the (E3\u00d7DA) F2 cross (Table 2, Fig. 2c ). DA alleles promoted disease in an additive fashion (data not shown). The strongest linkage was seen with the number of affected paws between day 28 and 35, during a period in which joint erosion was most extensive. As a consequence, high serum levels of carti-lage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) were linked to the same region, during the same period, with an identical inheritance pattern at day 35 (Fig. 2) . Thus, COMP and number of affected paws on day 35 showed a positive correlation (R s =0.66, P<1\u00d710 -7 ). We also observed possible, but not significant, influence on arthritis onset and chronicity by Pia4 (Fig. 4) .",

These phenotypes were positively correlated (R s =0.72, P<1\u00d710 -7 ), but may reflect different aspects because histopathology was carried out on the most affected paw at the end of the experiment, whereas the number of affected paws takes into account all paws during a longer period. A locus (Pia6) on chromosome 14 was significantly linked to the number of affected paws from day 83 (lod score 16 . Thus, only loci significant on a genome-wide basis with a lod score of more than 3.9 with a fixed mode of genetic inheritance are shown. This was done because in the present experiment, several phenotypes were analysed, of which three groups (onset, severity and chronicity) were considered independent.",

Our analysis showed that the DA strain has a recessive disease-promoting allele at Pia6 and an additive allele at Pia6 (Fig. 4) . One of the loci controlling chronicity, Pia5, is located in the vicinity of the previously described Cia3 locus, which controls collagen-induced arthritis 7 , and the Lyp/Iddm1 locus, which is associated with lymphopenia, diabetes and thyroiditis in the BB rat 8,9 (Fig. 3) . This may indicate the presence of a common susceptibility gene for several autoimmune diseases. The MHC region has been found to control the development of chronic arthritis in PIA using LEW congenic strains 6 , and the designation Pia1 is therefore reserved for this locus. Pia1 was, however, not found in the present cross, possibly due to the fact that none of the parental strains had the most susceptible haplotype (RT1 f ).",

One primer was labelled with 32 P-\u03b3ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Dupont/NEN) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham). Amplification conditions were as follows: 94 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 15 s, 55 \u00b0C for 2 min, 72 \u00b0C for 3 min and final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 7 min.

Thus, an improved genetic map was constructed (http://www.cmb.lu.se/contrib/ avd-0/e-avd-0.html; N.N. et al., manuscript submitted).
