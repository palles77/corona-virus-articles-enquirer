An anti-TfR1 antibody efficiently inhibited the replication of Machupo, Guanarito, Junin and Sabia viruses, but not that of Lassa virus. Iron depletion of culture medium enhanced, and iron supplementation decreased, the efficiency of infection by Junin and Machupo but not Lassa pseudoviruses.

Like other class 1 fusion proteins, GP1 is thought to mediate association with a cellular receptor 7 . After internalization of the virus to an acidified endosomal compartment, GP2 undergoes a conformational change that promotes fusion of the viral and cellular membranes [7] [8] [9] . We characterized a series of MACV GP1 truncation variants, fused at their carboxy termini to the Fc domain of human IgG1 (Fig. 1a) . Only full-length MACV GP1 (residues 59-258) and a single truncation variant, GP1\u0394 (residues 79-258), efficiently bound MACV-permissive Vero African green monkey kidney cells, whereas GP1 variants expressing residues 102-258, 121-258, 59-170 or 59-205 did not ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). GP1\u0394 bound Vero cells saturably and more efficiently than GP1 (Fig. 1b) . GP1\u0394, but not the receptor-binding domains of Lake Victoria marburgvirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus entry proteins, precipitated from Vero cells a protein of 95 kDa under reducing conditions, and approximately 200 kDa under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1c) . Massspectrometric analysis identified this protein as TfR1 (CD71). MACV GP1 efficiently bound a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing human TfR1 (CHO-hTfR1) 10 but did not bind parental CHO cells, confirming a high-affinity association between MACV GP1 and human TfR1 (Fig. 1d) .",

Vero, rhesus macaque LLC-MK2, and human HeLa and 293T cell lines efficiently bound GP1 and were permissive to MACV-GP-mediated infection (not shown). Consistent with the binding study in Fig. 1d was our observation that CHO-hTfR1 cells, but not parental CHO cells, were efficiently infected by MACV pseudoviruses, whereas LASV and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) pseudoviruses infected CHO-hTfR1 and parental cells comparably (Fig. 2a) . We investigated the ability of an anti-human TfR1 antibody and a control anti-HLA (anti-human leukocyte antigen) antibody to inhibit infection mediated by MACV and LASV GP proteins. Both antibodies efficiently bound HeLa and 293T cells (Fig. 2b , upper panels) but only the anti-human TfR1 antibody inhibited infection by MACV pseudovirus (Fig. 2b , lower panels). The anti-human TfR1 antibody had no effect on LASV pseudovirus infection. Together, these data indicate that TfR1 is a necessary receptor for MACV.",

However, treatment with deferoxamine consistently had a more modest effect on MACV pseudovirus infection.

LASV infection was unaffected by deferoxamine at all concentrations. We also investigated the ability of excess iron to modulate GP-mediated infection. Ferric ammonium citrate, which downregulates TfR1 (ref. 19) , efficiently inhibited MACV and JUNV pseudovirus infection but not that of LASV or LCMV.

It is rapidly and constitutively endocytosed to an acidic compartment, which is consistent with the pH dependence of arenavirus entry 8 . It is expressed ubiquitously, and at high levels on activated or rapidly dividing cells, including macrophages and activated lymphocytes, major targets of arenaviral infection 20, 21 . TfR1 is also highly expressed on endothelial cells 22, 23 , which are thought to be central to the pathogenesis of haemorrhagic fever 24 . TfR1 upregulation on immune cells activated in response to infection may accelerate viral replication in these cells and may in part explain the higher lethality of New World haemorrhagic fevers compared with Lassa fever. Some of these properties may also be useful to canine and feline parvoviruses and to mouse mammary tumour virus, animal viruses that also use TfR1 (refs 25, 26) .",
