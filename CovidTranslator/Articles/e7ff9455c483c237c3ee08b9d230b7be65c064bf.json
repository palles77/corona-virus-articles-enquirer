            "text": "Neuromodulation plays a critical role in brain function in both health and disease. New optical tools, and their validation in biological tissues, are needed that can image neuromodulation with high spatial and temporal resolution, which will add an important new dimension of information to neuroscience research. Here, we demonstrate the use of a catecholamine nanosensor with fluorescent emission in the 1000-1300 nm near-infrared window to measure dopamine transmission in ex vivo brain slices. These near-infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) represent a broader class of nanosensors that can be synthesized from non-covalent conjugation of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) with single strand oligonucleotides. We show that nIRCats can be used to detect catecholamine efflux in brain tissue driven by both electrical stimulation or optogenetic stimulation. Spatial analysis of electrically-evoked signals revealed dynamic regions of interest approximately 2 microns in size in which transients scaled with simulation intensity. Optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic terminals produced similar transients, whereas optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic terminals showed no effect on nIRCat signal. Bath application of nomifensine prolonged nIRCat fluorescence signal, consistent with reuptake blockade of dopamine. We further show that the chemically synthetic molecular recognition elements of nIRCats permit measurement of dopamine dynamics in the presence of dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists. These nIRCat nanosensors may be advantageous for future use because i) they do not require virus delivery, gene delivery, or protein expression, ii) their near-infrared fluorescence facilitates imaging in optically scattering brain tissue and is compatible for use in conjunction with other optical neuroscience tool sets, iii) the broad availability of unique near-infrared colors have the potential for simultaneous detection of multiple neurochemical signals, and iv) they are compatible with pharmacology.",

            "text": "The catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine are neuromodulators known to play an important role in learning and attention and are implicated in multiple brain disorders. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Dopamine, in particular, is thought to play a critical role in learning 6 , motivation 7, 8 , and motor control 9 , and aberrations in dopamine neurotransmission are implicated in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders including Parkinson's disease 10 , schizophrenia 11 , and addiction. 12 Neuromodulatory neurotransmission is thought to occur on a broader spatial scale than classic neurotransmission, which is largely mediated by synaptic release of the amino acids glutamate and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system. In synaptic glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, neurotransmitter concentrations briefly rise in the synaptic cleft to mediate local communication between the pre-and postsynaptic neurons through the rapid activation of ligand-gated ion channels. 13 In contrast, neuromodulators (catecholamines, neuropeptides) may diffuse beyond the synaptic cleft and act via extrasynaptically-expressed metabotropic receptors. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Thus, modulatory neurotransmitter activity extends beyond single synaptic partners and enables small numbers of neurons to modulate the activity of broader networks. 20 The absence of direct change in ionic flux across cell membranes, which is measurable using available tools like electrophysiology or genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs), has necessitated the use of methods borrowed from analytical chemistry such as microdialysis and amperometry to study the dynamics of neuromodulation. However, spatial limitations of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and spatial and temporal limitations of microdialysis currently make it difficult to interpret how neuromodulators affect the plasticity or function of target neural populations at behaviorally relevant spatiotemporal scales.",

            "text": "Ideally, to understand how neuromodulation sculpts brain activity, we need to develop tools that can optically report modulatory neurotransmitter concentrations in the brain extracellular space (ECS) in a manner that is compatible with pharmacology and other available tools to image neural structure and activity, and minimally interferes with the underlying biology. This goal motivates our effort to design an optical probe that can report extracellular catecholamine dynamics with high spatial and temporal fidelity within a unique near-infrared spectral profile. In this work, we describe the design, characterization, and implementation of a nanoscale near-infrared (nIR) non-genetically encoded fluorescent reporter that allows precise measurement of catecholamine dynamics in brain tissue. This technology makes use of a single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) noncovalently functionalized with single strand (GT)6 oligonucleotides to form the nearinfrared catecholamine nanosensor (nIRCat). nIRCats respond to dopamine with \u0394F/F of up to 24-fold in the fluorescence emission window of 1000-1300 nm 48 , a wavelength range that has shown utility for non-invasive through-skull imaging in mice. 21 First, we show in vitro characterization of the nanosensor's specificity for the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine, and demonstrate its insensitivity to GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. Second, we use ex vivo brain slices containing the dorsal striatum to demonstrate that nIRCats exhibit a fractional change in fluorescence that has the dynamic range and signalto-noise ratio to report dopamine efflux in response to brief electrical or optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic terminals. Next, optogenetic stimulation of this preparation is also used to demonstrate the selectivity of the nIRCat nanosensor response to dopaminergic over glutamatergic terminal stimulation. In both stimulation contexts, we show that bath application of dopamine receptor antagonist sulpiride and agonist quinpirole modulates nIRCat signals in a manner consistent with predicted effects of presynaptic D2 autoreceptor manipulation. Finally, we show that the presence of a dopamine reuptake inhibitor yields a prolonged nIRCat fluorescent signal indicating that the sensors report a change in the time course of dopamine diffusion and reuptake in striatal brain tissue. These data indicate that nIRCats provide a unique synthetic tool compatible with pharmacology to interrogate the release, diffusion, and reuptake of neuromodulators in neural tissue.",

Using a previously established nanosensor generation platform 22, 23 , synthetic bio-mimetic polymers were pinned onto the surface of intrinsically near-infrared fluorescent single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT). The resulting non-covalent nanometerscale conjugate produced the catecholamine-selective nIRCat. In in vitro solution phase experiments (Methods), nIRCats exhibited a maximal change in fluorescence (\u0394F/F) of up to 24 (Figure 1b, 1c) with a dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude, reporting detectable fluorescence changes from 10 nM to 100 \u00b5M dopamine concentration ( Figure S1 ). nIRCats were also sensitive to norepinephrine with a maximal response of \u2206F/F=35 and a similar dynamic range ( Figure S1 ). We found that nIRCats are insensitive to GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine ( Figure 1c ) and can report fluctuations in dopamine concentration in the presence of ascorbic acid, which is present in cerebrospinal fluid ( Figure S1 ). Singlemolecule imaging revealed that the nIRCat signal in response to repeated perfusions of 10 \u00b5M dopamine was reversible upon exposure, an important feature for measuring neuromodulator kinetics ( Figure S2 ). In previous work, we performed stochastic simulations that suggest nIRCats have sufficient sensitivity to detect physiologically relevant fluctuations in dopamine concentration in brain tissue arising from the activity of a single dopaminergic terminal, which can briefly exceed concentrations of 1 \u00b5M from the release site in a distance-dependent manner. 24",

Given that the dorsal striatum is densely innervated by dopaminergic projections from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) but lacks innervation from neurons that release norepinephrine (NE) 25 , we leveraged nIRCats capacity to serve as a dopamine sensor in the striatum. The majority of neurons within the striatum are GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) with a minority fraction of interneuron populations that include GABAergic and cholinergic interneurons. 26 Glutamatergic inputs from the cortex and thalamus are the major drivers of MSN activity and dopaminergic terminals in close proximity to these inputs are thought to play an important role in modulating the activity of MSNs and plasticity at striatal synapses. 27 Due to the composition of local axons, intrastriatal electrical stimulation is predicted to drive the release of a mix of neurotransmitter including GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, and dopamine, but negligible amounts of other catecholamines like norepinephrine.",

Slices were subsequently rinsed to remove excess nIRCats and incubated in standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) for another 15 minutes before imaging. This method, modified from Godin et al. 29 who demonstrated that SWNT localize in the ECS of acute brain slices, enabled even and widespread labeling of the coronal slice, including the dorsal striatum ( Figure 2c ). Imaging of nIRCat fluorescence modulation in dorsal striatum was accomplished with a custom-built visible and nearinfrared microscope to enable concurrent imaging of both visible (400 nm -750 nm) and near-infrared (750 nm -1700 nm) wavelengths on the same detector ( Figure 2b ). Briefly, a 785 nm laser for excitation of nIRCats and mercury bulb for generating brightfield images were directed onto the back focal plane of an epifluorescence upright microscope, and imaging channels were selected using a sliding mirror. Serially, either brightfield or nearinfrared images were collected on a Ninox Vis-SWIR 640 broadband camera (Raptor Photonics) with appropriate dichroic filters (Methods) and a 60X water dipping objective (Nikon) providing an imaging field of 178 \u00b5m by 142 \u00b5m, containing hundreds of dopaminergic terminals.

Inset: An example of nIRCat experimental data (blue dots) fitted to first order kinetics (red line) to compute decay time constants (\uf074). To identify nIRCat fluorescence change hotspots (i.e., regions of high \u2206F/F), we analyzed our video-rate acquisitions using a custom-built program that accounted for background fluorescence and identified regions with fluctuations in fluorescence intensity in the poststimulation epoch (see Methods for details). We defined nIRCat \u2206F/F hotspots as regions of interest (ROIs) based on a per-pixel stack projection of maximal \u2206F/F in the imaging time series. The ROIs identified were found to vary in size from 1 \u00b5m to 15 \u00b5m ( Figure  3d , 3e). We found that \u2206F/F hotspots do not necessarily correspond to high nIRCat labeling of the brain tissue, suggesting that the hotspot is a consequence of variation in dopamine release and not nanosensor loading in the tissue (Figure 3d , Figure S3 a-c). Using data from single pulse electrical stimulation experiments, the program identified ROIs whose size distribution was observed to exhibit a log-normal distribution with median ROI size of 2 \u00b5m (Figure 3e ). Repeat stimulations with the same stimulation amplitude in fields of view of the dorsomedial striatum across biological replicates generated similar size distributions (Figure 3f ). Closer examination of several larger ROIs (> 5\u00b5m) suggested these may be comprised of smaller hot-spots in close proximity (Figure 3g , Figure S3 d-e).",

FSCV is a technique that has been widely used to measure temporal catecholamine dynamics both in vivo and in vitro in the striatum and other brain areas. [30] [31] [32] FSCV and nIRCat experiments were conducted on separate experimental rigs with the same solutions, temperature settings, electrodes, and stimulation parameters. Evoked transients measured with FSCV and nIRCat fluorescence emission showed comparable temporal profiles in the rising phase (latency to peak: FSCV = 0.25 \u00b1 0.0 s vs. nIRCat = 0.40 \u00b1 0.18 s; mean \u00b1 s. d., n=4 fields of view from 2 biological replicates, p=0.23). Meanwhile, nIRCat signals exhibited a wider diversity of decay kinetics (\uf074: FSCV = 0.51 \u00b1 0.08 s vs. nIRCats = 2.43 \u00b1 0.24 s; mean \u00b1 s. d. n=4 fields of view from 2 biological replicates, p=0.0002). A subset of ROIs exhibited decay time constants that overlapped with, or were faster than, those of FSCV signals (Figure 3h, 3i) . We next evaluated the ability of nIRCats to detect dopamine in the presence of dopamine receptor (DR) drugs. In in vitro solution phase experiments (without biological tissue), we found that nIRCat fluorescence intensity was not modulated by exposure to 1 \u00b5M concentration of DRD2 antagonists sulpiride, haloperidol, the DRD2 agonist quinpirole, or the DRD1 antagonist SCH-23390 (Figure 4a) .

Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of using of a non-genetically encoded fluorescent sensor, nIRCat, which enables optical detection of catecholamine release and reuptake with sub-second temporal and with micrometer spatial resolution.

            "text": "While other tools are emerging to optically report dopamine fluctuations via cell-surface engineered proteins, 33, 34 nIRCats are likely to fulfill a niche amongst currently available methods for detecting dopamine neurotransmission due to their unique near-infrared fluorescence, the fact that they do not rely on genetic delivery and expression, and the functionality of nIRCats in the presence of pharmacological dopamine receptor ligands. This is in contrast to receptor-based fluorescent sensors which currently cannot report on endogenous dopamine dynamics in the presence of ligands to the engineered receptor. 33, 34 Furthermore, the synthetic nature of nIRCats affords complete elimination of potential GPCR-mediated residual signaling that may be present in protein-based optical probes. nIRCats also offer spatial advantages over FSCV, and our initial experiments suggest that the temporal resolution of the nIRCat signal can be comparable to that of FSCV. nIRCat decay profiles exhibit a wider range than that observed from FSCV data and included a significant number of ROIs that showed seconds-long time constants. It is debatable if these results capture the unique spatial properties of specific striatal ROIs or are related to tool differences alone. nIRCats, unlike FSCV probes, should sample catecholamine concentration at a single point in space, such that each distributed nIRCat construct can act as a probe within the ECS and therefore yield a \"higher resolution\" picture of catecholamine dynamics. Future experiments will investigate how the heterogeneity of nIRCat signals (amplitude and kinetics) relates to structural and functional properties at dopamine terminals and within the ECS. We predict that new optical tools for measuring dopamine dynamics with high spatial resolution will be enable new insights into the regulation of dopamine release and reuptake at the level of individual synapses. [35] [36] [37] In the future, we see potential for expansion of a larger family of SWNT based nearinfrared nanosensors (nIRNS) similar to nIRCats for multiple neurochemical imaging applications. Several lines of evidence illustrate their future potential. First, nIRNS are easily functionalized with a wide range of synthetic molecular recognition moieties, affording fine control of their surface functional elements and their interactions with the local chemical environment. [38] [39] [40] SWNT fluorescence can be finely tuned to monochromatic emission in the near-infrared II (1000-1700 nm) window by controlling the SWNT chirality. 41 This chirality-dependent fluorescence in the near-infrared II window provides further avenues for designing color-specific responses to multiple molecular analytes simultaneously, thereby affording synthesis of ratiometric and multiplexed analyte imaging platforms, as we have shown previously. 42 Second, SWNT-based nanosensors rely on near-infrared fluorescence, which greatly reduces the impact of tissue scattering in the emission window and therefore may enable through-cranium imaging. 21 nIRNS are compatible with multi-photon imaging with 1600 nm excitation 43 and as such could permit nanoscale imaging of intact neuronal structures pending parallel developments in allinfrared microscopy, as has been shown with visible wavelength-emitting fluorophores. 44 Third, nIRNS have robust photostability allowing for use in long-term imaging experiments. 45 Fourth, because nIRNS are not genetically-encoded, they could enable use in species where gene delivery and protein expression is too difficult, time consuming, or undesirable. Finally, nanosecond-scale binding kinetics and the nanoscale dimensions of nIRNS 48 , are likely to enable generation of nanosensors with improved temporal and spatial resolution. In sum, nIRCats are versatile catecholamine probes amenable to multiplexing with existing tools for concurrent investigation of dopaminergic neuromodulation with other core mechanisms of brain function.",

The slice was subsequently recovered and rinsed in oxygen saturated ACSF to wash off nIRCats that did not localize into the brain tissue. The rinsing step was performed by transferring the slice through 3 wells of a 24 well plate (5 seconds in each well) followed by transfer to the recording chamber with ACSF perfusion for a 15-minute equilibration period before starting the imaging experimentation. All imaging experiments were performed at 32\u00b0C. Acute slices were prepared as described previously. Extracellular dopamine concentration evoked by local electrical stimulation was monitored with FSCV at carbon-fiber microelectrodes (CFMs) using Millar voltammeter. CFMs were ~ 7 \u00b5m in diameter encased in glass capillary pulled to form a seal with the fiber and cut to final tip length of 70-120 \u00b5m. The CFM was positioned ~100 \u00b5m below the tissue surface at a 45-degree angle. A triangular waveform was applied to the CFM scanning from -0.7 V to +1.3 V and back, against Ag/AgCl reference electrode at a rate of 800 V/s. Evoked dopamine transients were sampled at 8 Hz, and data were acquired at 50 kHz using AxoScope 10.5 (Molecular Devices). Oxidation currents evoked by electrical stimulation were converted to dopamine concentration from post-experimental calibrations. Recorded FSCV signals were identified as dopamine by comparing oxidation (+0.6 V) and reduction (-0.2 V) potential peaks from experimental voltammograms with currents recorded during calibration with 2 \u00b5M dopamine dissolved in ACSF. For stimulation, a bipolar stimulation electrode (FHC CBAEC75) was positioned on top of the brain slice and approximately 100 \u00b5m away from the CFM. Following 30-minute slice equilibration in the recording chamber, dopamine release was evoked using a square pulse (0.3 mA pulse amplitude, 3 ms pulse duration) controlled by Isoflex stimulus isolator (A.M.P.I) and delivered out of phase with the voltammetric scans. Stimulation was repeated 3 times. To compare FSCV and nIRcat data, each signal was normalized against its peak value ([DA]max or (\u2206F/F)max) and co-aligned at stimulation time. Latency to peak were computed as tpeak -tstim where tpeak is the time at which peak signal is attained and tstim is time of stimulation. Decay time constants (\uf074) were computed from model fits to a first order decay process.",

            "text": "Optogenetic release of dopamine imaged by nIRCats. (a) Schematic of ChR2 expression in cortical glutamatergic terminals of the dorsal striatum. (b) No nIRCat fluorescence modulation was observed after stimulation of glutamate terminals. Inset: glutamate release was confirmed by excitatory postsynaptic current on medium spiny neuron. (c) Schematic of ChR2 expression in nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals of the dorsal striatum. (d) Stimulation of dopaminergic terminals resulted in nIRCat fluorescence modulation. Stimulation protocol in (b) and (d) was 5 pulses at 25 Hz and power flux of 1 mW/mm 2 and each pulse had a duration of 5ms. (e). nIRCat \u2206F/F in response to increasing number of pulses delivered at 25 Hz, 5 ms pulse duration. (f) nIRCat \u2206F/F in response to increasing pulse frequency (1, 10, 25 Hz) of 5 pulses. Each pulse had a duration of 5 ms. (g) nIRCat \u2206F/F in response to single pulses of 2 ms, 5 ms and 10 ms duration. (h) Bath application of 1 \u00b5M of quinpirole suppresses dopamine release and results in depressed nIRCat \u2206F/F. Drug wash-out rescues dopamine release and nIRCat \u2206F/F. All error bands represent standard deviation from the mean trace.",
