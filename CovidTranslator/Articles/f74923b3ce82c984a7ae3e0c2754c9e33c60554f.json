Clinical samples were collected from 120 patients diagnosed as suspected or probable SARS cases and analyzed by conventional PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, conventional TaqMan real-time PCR, and our enhanced TaqMan real-time PCR assays. An amplicon of the size expected from SARS-CoV was obtained from 28/120 samples using the enhanced real-time PCR method. Conventional PCR and real-time PCR alone identified fewer SARS-CoV positive cases. Results were confirmed by viral culture in 3/28 cases. The limit of detection of the enhanced real-time PCR method was 10 2 -fold higher than the standard real-time PCR assay and 10 7 -fold higher than conventional PCR methods. The increased sensitivity of the assay may help control the spread of the disease during future SARS outbreaks.",

The SARS-CoV has been found in sputum, throat swabs, serum, lung, kidney, bone marrow, and faeces, among others [1] [2] [3] [4] . However, negative results by PCR do not necessarily mean that the patient does not have SARS, as many factors affect viral nucleic acid detection, including insensitivity of the primers and probes used in the amplification protocol, the absence of SARS-CoV infection, the observed illness being caused by another infectious agent, false negative PCR results, or the specimens were collected at a time when the virus or its genetic material was not present or was at an undetectable level with the current methods. Therefore, it is important to devise a method that is sufficiently sensitive to screen effectively for SARS-CoV.",

It should be noted that our experience with some of the SARS-CoV specific primers varies from that described by other laboratories. For example, other workers have described a 70% success rate in amplifying SARS-CoV target sequences from patient samples using the COR-1/COR-2 primers [11] .

First, a $190 bp region of the SARS-CoV polymerase gene was amplified from the cDNA by conventional PCR. The amplicon was sequenced and confirmed to correspond to the expected region of SARS-CoV (data not shown). This PCR product was subsequently used as the template for the enhanced real-time PCR protocol using the same set of primers. With this protocol, 28/120 (23.3%) patient samples were identified as SARS-CoV positive compared with 21/120 (18.3%) with the standard real-time method and an average of only 10.6% with the various conventional PCR methods ( Table 2) . Suitable negative, positive, and PCR inhibition controls were used at each stage of the amplification procedure (data not shown). A selection of standard and enhanced real-time PCR data for clinical samples is shown (Figs. 1A-D) . The clear differentiation between SARS-CoV positive and SARS-CoV negative samples is obvious (Fig. 1A , indicated by arrows). The discrimination between positive and negative signals is more ambiguous when the same samples are analyzed by standard real-time PCR, where the SARS-CoV positive and negative amplification curves tend to overlap closely with one another (Fig. 1B) . Therefore, clinicians less experienced in interpreting real-time PCR results can distinguish easily between positive and negative signals with the enhanced results obtained. The enhanced real-time PCR method results in a lowering of the cycle time (Ct) value for SARS-CoV positive samples compared with the conventional realtime PCR method. A Ct value of 635.0 is a suitable cutoff for distinguishing unambiguously between samples containing SARS-CoV nucleic acid from those that do not. A minor limitation of this method is that it is not possible to quantify the amount of virus in each sample as the exponential increases in copy number during the pre-amplification stage masked the initial template concentration during the real-time amplification step.",

Thus, the enhanced real-time PCR method is at least 10 2 -fold more sensitive than the standard real-time PCR and 10 7 -fold more sensitive than any of the conventional PCR techniques currently used for molecular detection of SARS-CoV. Detection of SARS-CoV by viral culture may be the least sensitive method as shown in Table 2 , where only 3/28 (10.7%) cases detected by enhanced real-time PCR were positive for SARS-CoV by viral culture.",

The other two cases had symptoms clinically compatible with pneumonia. Viral culture was negative in both cases. Neither case was reported to the DH as probable SARS. In one case (31,027), SARS was not excluded definitively. Note that virus was only cultured from 3/28 patients in whom SARS-CoV nucleic acid was demonstrated to be present by multiple PCR tests. In addition, serological data for SARS is likely to persist globally as a disease that must be considered when a patient with upper respiratory tract infection presents. Vaccines against SARS-CoV and specific drug interventions may not become available in the short term, if ever, and no animal model for the disease is currently available. Any new detection method that improves the accuracy of diagnosis is a valuable addition to the panoply of diagnostic tools available to a clinician.",

Two cases reported to the DH as probable SARS are of particular interest. Patient 31,131 died from SARS. However, at the time of sampling SARS-CoV serology results were inconclusive (titre <40), possibly due to sampling prior to seroconversion. However, the enhanced realtime PCR method readily detected SARS-CoV nucleic acid in samples taken at the same time. For patient 31,146, samples taken on 22 April 2003 examined by conventional PCR and standard real-time PCR were negative for SARS-CoV. The enhanced real-time PCR was positive(Table 4). On 23 April 2003, the patient was sampled again and SARS-CoV was detected by conventional PCR (data not shown). Thus, one day makes a considerable difference in the ability of conventional PCR methods to detect SARS-CoV. A more sensitive detection method would clarify the clinical picture greatly and allow more focused treatment.",
