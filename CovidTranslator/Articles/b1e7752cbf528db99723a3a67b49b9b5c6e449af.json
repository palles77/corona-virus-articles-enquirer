This suggests that when a 25 virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species. This 26 may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species, and may mean that when 27 a new pathogen appears in a given species, closely related species may become vulnerable to the 28 new disease.",

RNA viruses seem particularly prone to host shift [1] [2] [3] [4] , with 33 HIV, Ebola virus and SARS coronavirus all having been acquired by humans from other host species 34 [5] [6] [7] . Whilst some pathogens may be pre-adapted to a novel host, there are increasing numbers of 35 examples demonstrating that adaptation to the new host occurs following a host shift [8, 9] . These 36 adaptations may allow a pathogen to enter host cells, increase replication rates, avoid or suppress 37 the host immune response, or optimise virulence or transmission [10, 11] . For example, in the 2013-38 2016 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, a mutation in the viral glycoprotein gene that arose early 39 in the outbreak and rose to high frequency was found to increase infectivity in human cells and 40 decrease infectivity in bats, which are thought to be the source of Ebola virus [12, 13] . Likewise, a 41 switch of a parvovirus from cats to dogs resulted in mutations in the virus capsid that allowed the 42 virus to bind to cell receptors in dogs, but resulted in the virus losing its ability to infect cats [14, 15] ",

These phylogenetic patterns suggest that mutations that adapt a virus to one 178 host may also adapt it to closely related host species. Therefore, there may be a knock-on effect, 179 where a host shift leaves closely related species vulnerable to the new disease.",
