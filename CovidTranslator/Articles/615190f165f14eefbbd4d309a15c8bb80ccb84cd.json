            "text": "In Taiwan, where active HIV/AIDS surveillance has been in place since 1996, with 2.1-2.5 million annual screening tests and free antiretroviral therapy (ART) introduced since 1997, [1] [2] [3] [4] During this time-period, an outbreak of HIV-1 CRF07_BC infections among IDUs, including many previously seldom-seen female IDU HIV-infected cases, resulted in more reported cases than all reported HIV cases among all risk groups combined in the previous 20 years since 1984, when the first AIDS case was reported. It has been speculated that the source of this outbreak was a drugtrafficking route to Taiwan from Yunnan Province via southeast China, Guangxi Province, and Hong Kong, [6] [7] [8] from where a substantial amount of heroin was being smuggled into Taiwan. Moreover, five IDUs from southern Taiwan were diagnosed as the country's first HIV-1-seropositive cases infected with CRF07_BC in 2002. 2 It has been reported that the percentage of persons receiving a diagnosis of AIDS within 12 months of diagnosis of HIV infection dropped suddenly from 20% in 2003 to 8.3% in 2005, during the time when most of the newly diagnosed cases came from the IDU population, which implies that the detected IDU cases were in the early stage of HIV infection. 4 It has also been reported 1 that 96% of Objective: To ascertain the explosive 2004-2006 outbreak of HIV-1 CRF07_BC among intravenous drug users (IDU) in Taiwan, which more than doubled the total number of reported HIV cases in less than 3 years, resulting in a 45-fold increase in cumulative IDU/HIV cases and a 40-fold increase in previously seldom-reported female IDU/HIV cases. Methods: A mathematical model was utilized to fit the monthly case data, in order to estimate the turning points (peak incidence) and the reproduction number R of the outbreak. Furthermore, correlation analysis was carried out to assess the correlation between infections among the male and female IDUs. Results: Model fit revealed a two-wave epidemic during April 2004-March 2007. The larger second wave started shortly after May 2005 and peaked in October 2005 before gradually subsiding. R was estimated to be 3.15 (3.14-3.16) and 27.21 (26.73-28 .05) for the two respective waves. The time series of monthly differences in male and female case data were found to be most significantly correlated at lag 0 (i.e., r > 0.7) with r = 0.906 and 0.804, respectively in each direction. The Granger causality test indicated that the male time series caused the corresponding female time series with a lag of 2 months or less. Conclusions: The modeling results revealed the presence of a small first wave in 2004, before an explosion of cases after May 2005. Furthermore, a harm reduction program implemented in August 2005 contributed to the downturn in the epidemic after October. Correlation results also suggest that the upsurge in male HIV cases led to the subsequent drastic surge in female cases.",

A recent molecular epidemiology study after the CRF07_BC outbreak in Taiwan concluded that while the percentage of CRF07_BC among all HIV infections decreased from 2007 to 2009, the percentage of subtype B actually increased. 11 However, many questions remain regarding this sudden outbreak among the IDU population.",

A DLM is a regression model that includes current and lagged values of one or more explanatory variables. This model allows the determination of what the effects are for a change in a time series. The resulting correlation coefficient, r, is a useful measure of linear strength between two random variables. The mathematical formula for computing r is: where n is the number of pairs of data. The value of r is such that \u00c01 r + 1. The '+' and '\u00c0' signs are used for positive linear correlations and negative linear correlations, respectively. If there is no linear correlation or a weak linear correlation, r is close to 0. A value near zero means that there is a random, nonlinear relationship between the two variables. 'jrj 0.4' means 'low correlation', '0.4 < jrj 0.7' means 'moderate correlation', and 'jrj > 0.7' means 'high correlation'. In other words, a correlation greater than 0.7 is generally described as strong, whereas a correlation less than 0.4 is generally described as weak.",

Due to the lack of a reliable estimate for the HIV generation time among IDUs in the literature, a generational interval of 5 or 6 months was assumed, based on an estimate of doubling time for AIDS cases among IDUs in the northeastern USA early in the epidemic. 22 It should be noted that the main purpose for estimating R in this study was to compare the transmissibility estimated using different datasets and to ascertain the relative temporal change in transmissibility that occurred in each wave of infection during the course of the epidemic.",

Although no timeline of the two waves was available from the molecular study, it does corroborate our modeling results. The estimates for R indicate that the transmissibility of HIV among the IDU population increased from the first wave to the second wave according to all three datasets, culminating in a peak around October 2005, when a downward trend ensued. It is interesting to note that the harm reduction program that was implemented by the Taiwanese government in August 2005 could have impacted the downturn in case numbers after October, as revealed by our modeling results. However, only a trial harm reduction program, which included a needle-syringe program (NSP) and substitution treatment in four counties, was established at that time. After 1 year of the pilot study, data indicated that the HIV incidence in cities with an NSP decreased from 13.9 to 13.3 per 100 000 persons compared to an incidence increase from 11.5 to 15.3 per 100 000 persons in cities without an NSP. 26 Subsequently, the harm reduction program was expanded to the whole of Taiwan in July 2006. Therefore, the country-wide downturn in case numbers after October 2005 may only be partially attributable to the harm reduction program.",

However, this drastic upsurge in female HIV-infected IDUs was relatively more difficult to sustain in the second wave, as indicated by the shorter length of this wave when compared to that of the males. Therefore the epidemic impacted female IDUs more drastically initially, but the overall magnitude of infection was still less than that of the males, which was the group most affected by the epidemic. Correlation analysis of the time series of male and female cases indicates that the outbreak among female IDUs was most likely driven by the infections among male IDUs, who were far more numerous at the beginning of the epidemic. In the Granger causality test, the lag length corresponds to the longest time over which one of the variables could help to predict the other. Therefore, the minimum p-value at a lag of 2 months for both the time series of case numbers and the first differences of the time series suggests that the strongest causality relationship, of male infections causing female infections, was within 2 months, a rather immediate relationship that led to the sudden upsurge in reported female HIV/IDU cases shortly after the upsurge of the male IDU cases in early 2004. It also indicates that there is likely some needle-sharing or apparatus-sharing among and between male and female IDUs, although one cannot rule out the possibility of sexual contact between the male and female IDUs, since one study 25 in Taiwan found that 99.1% of the HIV-infected IDUs participating in the study were heterosexual. Unfortunately no data on any relationships that might exist between the reported cases were available. The study further demonstrates how quickly a disease traditionally endemic in a male population can develop into an epidemic in the female population given appropriate circumstances; hence transmission across gender is an important aspect of disease surveillance.",

This further demonstrates the future potential of real-time modeling and analysis of disease data 27 as part of a disease surveillance system, which could conceivably detect and alert the authorities of a possible herald wave before the arrival of a major outbreak. The waves ended by March 2007, which could be attributable to a timely and effective harm reduction program implemented in August 2005; this has been essential in preventing further occurrences of wide-spread infections among IDUs in Taiwan since 2007.
