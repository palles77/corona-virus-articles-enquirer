Fourteen of the 20 cats developed diarrhea and did not respond to anthelmintics or antibiotics. The remaining 6 cats were healthy. The cats with diarrhea were separated from the other cats, and newly-collected feces were subjected to experiments. Feline coronavirus was detected in fecal samples from 5 healthy cats and 11 cats with diarrhea. In addition, feline bocavirus was detected in fecal samples from 3 cats with diarrhea ( We named the virus detected in this study feline stoolassociated circular virus (FeSCV). To determine the complete genomic sequence of FeSCV, inverse primers (CV841F 5'-TTC TCC CGA CCT GGA CAT AG and CV664R 5'-ACA GAG ATG ATA GCG TCC GG) were prepared based on a section of the base sequence of the acquired Rep gene, and inverse PCR was performed. Fig. S1 shows the schematic position of the inverse PCR primers and other primers used for the FeSCV genome. Prior to inverse PCR, circular DNA was multiplied using TempliPhi TM 100 Amplification Kit (GE Healthcare, USA). Viral DNA was amplified by inverse PCR, which was performed in a total volume of 50 \u03bcL using the following mixture: 3 \u03bcL of multiplied circular DNA mixed with 10 \u03bcL of 5X PrimeSTAR buffer (TaKaRa, Japan), 4 \u03bcL of dNTP mixture (TaKaRa, Japan) containing 2.5 mM of each dNTP, 1 \u03bcL of 20 \u03bcM primer mix (FC1F), 0.5 \u03bcL of PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase (2.5 U/mL; TaKaRa, Japan), and 31.5 \u03bcL of distilled water. Using a thermal cycler, the DNA was amplified at 98\u00b0C for 1 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98\u00b0C for 10 sec, primer annealing at 55\u00b0C for 15 sec, and synthesis at 72\u00b0C for 1 min with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. From all samples, approximately 1,800-bp amplicons were acquired. The sequences of the viral genomes were obtained by sequencing the overlapping PCR products (amplicons of 400 and 1,800 bp in size). Phylogenetic trees based on Rep were analyzed using MEGA software (version 6). Phylogenetic relationships were evaluated using the neighbor-joining algorithm, and branching order reliability was analyzed by 1,000 replications of bootstrap resampling. All 4 strains of FeSCV were circular DNA viruses containing a genome (Fig. 1B) .",

Of note, the putative Rep and putative Cap of FeSCV were approximately 50% homologous with RNA helicase and the hypothetical protein of Giardia intestinalis, respectively. The FeSCV genomes were submitted to GenBank under 3 accession numbers LC389584 (KU14), LC406404 (KU7), LC406405 (KU8), and LC406406 (KU9), respectively. Based on the base sequence of FeSCV clarified in this study, specific primers to detect the FeSCV gene (FeSCV1F 5'-GCT AAG GTC TGC CTC AGG TG and FeSCV1R 5'-CTA TGT CCA GGT CGG GAG AA) were prepared.

The degenerate primers used in Table 2 Highly conserved motifs of Rep detected in FeSCV based on the report by Rosario et al. [7] x: any amino acid u: hydrophobic amino acid (F, I, L, V, or M) this nested PCR assay were prepared based on the consensus sequence of the Rep gene in 12 strains of circoviruses and one strain of cyclovirus [14] since we expected only circoviruses and cycloviruses to be detected. However, a novel CRESS DNA virus, FeSCV, was detected in the fecal samples. Phylogenetic analysis based on Rep revealed that FeSCV belongs in a clade different from that of circoviruses and cycloviruses for which the reason is unclear. Very few known CRESS DNA viruses, including circoviruses, have been confirmed to have pathogenicity in the host. Moreover, many studies on novel CRESS DNA viruses analyzed only viral genes, that is, only a few studies analyzed whether the viral infection is manifested in the host. The FeSCV found in this study was detected in 13 of the 20 cats. Based on this result, cats may be the natural host of FeSCV. Furthermore, the 4 FeSCVs (KU7 strain, KU8 strain, KU9 strain, and KU14 strain) are genetically similar and share approximately 100% of their genomes. This data suggests that these FeSCVs have the same origin. The FeSCV infection rates in healthy cats and cats with diarrhea were 50.0 and 71.4%, respectively and demonstrate that although the infection rate was slightly higher in cats with diarrhea, half of the healthy cats were also infected with FeSCV. Thus, it is unclear whether FeSCV is pathogenic. Furthermore, the rate of co-infection with FeSCV and other viruses was approximately 2-fold higher in cats with diarrhea (64.2%) than in healthy cats (33.3%). In dogs, a relationship between CaCV and gastroenteritis has been suggested. Dowgier et al. [15] reported that CaCV infection and the development of acute gastroenteritis were correlated in dogs co-infected with other enteric viruses. The incidence of enteritis may increase when FeSCV-infected cats are co-infected with other viruses. Further investigation of FeSCV pathogenicity in cats is necessary.",

However, we concluded that FeSCV is a circular DNA virus based on the following: 1) No Giardia intestinalis was detected in the fecal test, and 2) the complete genome of FeSCV was amplified using the rolling-circle amplification and inverse PCR assays. Similar with FeSCV, RodSCV is reported to have Rep with <52% homology with RNA helicase of Giardia intestinalis [16] . Moreover, both the putative Rep and putative Cap of FeSCV are similar to proteins derived from Giardia intestinalis.
