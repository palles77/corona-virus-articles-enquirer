The Western Pacific Region has been a hotspot for emerging infectious diseases and remains vulnerable to future health security threats due to multiple factors such as increased international travel and trade, migration and urbanization, intensive production of livestock and illegal wildlife trade. 5 The Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (APSED) is a regional tool to assist countries with IHR (2005) implementation and progress has been made in establishing capacities within the APSED focus areas. 6 Although measuring capacity improvement and related health impact as a direct result of IHR (2005) remains a challenge, 7 there are certainly success stories in this Region.",

Building and maintaining the surveillance systems envisioned in IHR (2005) will require on-going substantial financial and technical resources. 13 Therefore, although the ideal is to invest in all capacity areas equally, reality calls for prioritization, or a more focused approach, to meet IHR (2005) obligations. Given limited resources, focusing on those common capacities will provide a foundation for an all-hazards approach for addressing public health emergencies regardless of causes. 12 One example of this focused approach is the strengthening and monitoring of basic surveillance and response systems that can enable early detection, timely assessment and swift response to all emerging disease outbreaks and public health emergencies.",

At that time, the revision process of the International Health Regulations (IHR) was underway. 1 However, as considered by MacKenzie and Merianos in this issue of WPSAR \"perhaps the most important legacy from SARS was the additional urgency and focus given to the revision of IHR by the World Health Assembly.\" 2 The substantially revised IHR (2005) entered into force in June 2007 and represented a major development from IHR (1969) in the use of an international legal instrument to protect public health. Recently, IHR (2005) has been used as a global tool to collectively respond to the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) from 2012 and the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in 2013.",
