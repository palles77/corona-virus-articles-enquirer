            "text": "Dengue virus serotypes 1-4 (DENV1-4) are transmitted by mosquitoes which cause most frequent arboviral infections in the world resulting in ~390 million cases with ~25,000 deaths annually. There is no vaccine or antiviral drug currently available for human use. Compounds containing quinoline scaffold were shown to inhibit flavivirus NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) with good potencies. In this study, we screened quinoline derivatives, which are known antimalarial drugs for inhibition of DENV2 and West Nile virus (WNV) replication using the corresponding replicon expressing cell-based assays. Amodiaquine (AQ), one of the 4-aminoquinoline drugs, inhibited DENV2 infectivity measured by plaque assays, with EC 50 and EC 90 values of 1.08 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b5M and 2.69 \u00b1 0.47 \u00b5M, respectively, and DENV2 RNA replication measured by Renilla luciferase reporter assay, with EC 50 value of 7.41 \u00b1 1.09 \u00b5M in the replicon expressing cells. Cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) in BHK-21 cells was 52.09 \u00b1 4.25 \u00b5M. The replication inhibition was confirmed by plaque assay of the extracellular virions as well as by qRT-PCR of the intracellular and extracellular viral RNA levels. AQ was stable for at least 96 h and had minor inhibitory effect on entry, translation, and post-replication stages in the viral life cycle. DENV protease, 5'-methyltransferase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase do not seem to be targets of AQ. Both p-hydroxyanilino and diethylaminomethyl moieties are important for AQ to inhibit DENV2 replication and infectivity. Our results support AQ as a promising candidate for antiflaviviral therapy.",

            "text": "DENV RNA encodes a single polyprotein which is processed to yield 3 structural proteins, capsid (C), precursor membrane (prM), and envelope (E), and 7 nonstructural (NS) proteins, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 (Lindenbach et al., 2007) . For viral RNA replication, cis-acting RNA elements encoded within the 5'-and 3'-untranslated regions (UTR), coding regions within the N-terminal capsid protein and the C-terminal envelope as well as the 7 NS proteins are sufficient (for excellent reviews, see (Lindenbach et al., 2007; Paranjape and Harris, 2010; Villordo and Gamarnik, 2009; Westaway et al., 2003) . To study the cis-acting RNA elements and trans-acting viral and host factors required for replication, subgenomic replicons have been constructed for several flaviviruses, Kunjin (Khromykh and Westaway, 1997) , WNV (Alcaraz-Estrada et al., 2013b; Shi et al., 2002) , YFV (Jones et al., 2005a) , DENV2 (Alvarez et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2005b; Manzano et al., 2011; Ng et al., 2007) , and DENV4 (Alcaraz-Estrada et al., 2010) . Stable replicon expressing cell lines have been used in screening antiviral compounds as potential inhibitors of viral replication (for reviews, see (Noble et al., 2010; Sampath and Padmanabhan, 2009 ). Since flavivirus RNA encodes several enzymes that play important roles in the virus life cycle, in vitro assays have been developed for screening antiviral compounds. For example, in vitro assays for the twocomponent viral protease, NS2B-NS3pro (Lai et al., 2013; Mueller et al., 2008; Yusof et al., 2000) , 5'-RNA methyltransferase catalyzed by the N-terminal domain of NS5 (Dong et al., 2008b; Egloff et al., 2002; Ray et al., 2006) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) catalyzed by the C-terminal domain of NS5 (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001; Niyomrattanakit et al., 2011; Niyomrattanakit et al., 2010) . These assays have been useful to identify inhibitors of protease (Ezgimen et al., 2012; Johnston et al., 2007; Lai et al., 2013) , 5'-RNA methyltransferase ; reviewed in (Dong et al., 2008b) ), and RdRp (Niyomrattanakit et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2011; Zou et al., 2011) by small molecule compounds.",

AQD8 at various concentrations was added to DENV2 infected BHK-21 cells (MOI of 1). After 72 h incubation, supernatants were collected and the virus titers were determined by plaque assay. Results showed an EC 90 of AQD8 at 31.20 \u00b1 5.15 \u00b5M (Fig. 5) , which is more than 10 fold higher compared to that of AQ (EC 90 of 2.69 \u00b1 0.47 \u00b5M). Thus, AQD8 has a modest potency in inhibition of replicon replication and viral infectivity. These results indicate that the diethylaminomethyl group is a key chemical structural moiety of AQ contributing to inhibition of DENV2 replication and infectivity.",

            "text": "Amodiaquine (AQ) was synthesized in 1980s by addition of 4-hydroxyanilino group to chloroquine (CQ). AQ was proven effective against chloroquine-resistant strain (reviewed in (O'Neill et al., 1998) ). The drug was later withdrawn from long-term antimalarial prophylaxis due to its rare but serious side effects, agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity (WHO 1990, reviewed by (Olliaro and Mussano, 2003) ). Cochrane systematic review in 1996, however, supported the use of AQ for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Besides, an adverse drug reaction study found no significant difference among CQ, AQ, and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine antimalarials (reviewed by (Olliaro and Mussano, 2003) ). This impact enforced WHO 1997 to modify its recommendation such that AQ became an optional treatment of uncomplicated malaria (reviewed by (Olliaro and Mussano, 2003) ). AQ regimen for antimalarial treatment is three days of 600-800 mg/day in an adult. Pharmacogenetic studies have discovered a genetic trait in patient population who are susceptible to an adverse effect of hepatotoxicity due to AQ linked to polymorphisms of CYP2C8 gene, one of the cytochrome P450s. The genetic variants of CYP2C8 gene, CYP2C8*2 and CYP2C8*3, were reported to be responsible for defective metabolism resulting in slow clearance of AQ (reviewed by (Kerb et al., 2009) ). The genotypes, CYP2C8*2 and CYP2C8*3, were recorded in African and Caucasian population with the frequency of 11-17%, and 15%, respectively. Dose-adjustments of AQ and increased safety precautions are required for treatment of patients with these polymorphisms in order to prevent the intoxication. Given the anti-dengue efficacy shown in this study, AQ is likely to become a powerful candidate for treatment of DENV infected patients.",

Time-course analysis suggested that the drug was stable and reproducibly inhibited DENV2 infectivity up to 96 h post-infection. We also learned that the viral entry and internalization was partially inhibited by the drug but the major effect of drug occurred at a later stage of the viral life cycle up to 15 h post-infection. This effect of AQ at early stages (adsorption/entry) would be absent in replicon-expressing cells and hence the EC 50 values are higher (Table 1 and Fig. 2) . AQ was also ineffective to inhibit replication that is already established as seen in the time of addition assays. A previous study showed that DENV2 replication starts 12 h post-infection as suggested by rapid increase of intracellular RNA levels in BHK-21 cells quantified by qRT-PCR (Shrivastava et al., 2011) . In this study, we have shown that the drug was less effective when added later than 15 h post-infection as measured by viral infectivity (Fig.  4E-F) . Based on our results, we conclude that early stages of virus life cycle including translation, assembly of viral replicase complex and initiation of viral RNA replication could be targets of AQ.",

The crystal structure of two molecules of AQ in complex with histamine-N-methyltransferase at the SAM binding pocket, and the nearby outer pocket were solved (Horton et al., 2005) . Another crystal structure of AQ in complex with phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase from Plasmodium falciparum at SAM binding pocket was also reported . However, our results excluded the 5'-RNA methyltransferase and the RdRP activities of NS5 as well as the protease activity of NS3 as the targets of AQ. Viral replication requires both viral and host factors (reviewed in (Bollati et al., 2010; Ivanyi-Nagy and Darlix, 2012; Sampath and Padmanabhan, 2009) ). It is possible that AQ targets a nonstructural protein without an enzymatic function or an unknown host factor(s) required for replication. Isolation and characterization of AQ-resistant mutants and mapping these mutations by sequence analysis might reveal the identity of the putative viral target. Although most of the DENV2 infected BHK-21 cells die within 12 days in the presence of 5 \u00b5M AQ (unpublished results), a longer incubation period, up to 30 days, might yield escape mutants (Teramoto et al., 2008) . An in vitro RdRP system (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001; Nomaguchi et al., 2003) could provide an insight into whether the replication initiation factors of viral replication are targets of AQ.",

In the study by Farias et al. (2013) , the maximum inhibitory effect was seen between 6 and 24 h of incubation whether the CQ was added at 1 h after infection with no further addition, or CQ replenished after 12 h and 24 h after initial addition at 1 h. This inhibitory effect of CQ is past the entry and fusion events, well into translation and initiation of replication phases. Moreover, in our study, we provide evidence showing that the profile of inhibition of DENV by CQ is similar to that by AQ (Fig. 5 ) as the effect of AQ was lost when added after ~15-20 h post-infection ( Fig. 4E and 4F ).",

            "text": "CQ seems to have diverse antiviral effects depending on the virus. For example, in the HIV-1 infection of primary, or established T or monocytes, CHQ did not seem to inhibit entry or production of steady state levels of HIV-1 mRNA but did affect the production of HIV-1 virions (Sperber et al., 1993) . CQ has been reported to increase the intracellular pH and interferes with prM to M cleavage at the virion maturation step in DENV2 life cycle but 100 \u00b5M concentration was used in that study (Randolph et al., 1990) . CQ has been other therapeutic applications. For example, CQ is being used in a randomized controlled clinical study for treatment of dengue in Vietnamese adults (Tricou et al., 2010) . CQ has also been to have antiviral activities against HIV-1 ( Solomon and Lee, 2009; Sperber et al., 1993) and SARS Coronavirus (De Clercq, 2006; Vincent et al., 2005) as well as for treatment of cancer and arthritic diseases. Moreover, ferroquine (FQ), a CQ derivative structurally similar to AQ, inhibited HCV infection at an early step by interfering with fusion (Vausselin et al., 2013) and had minor inhibitory effects on viral replication and assembly. From the currently available data, we conclude that each quinoline compound interferes at a different stage in flaviviral life cycle. Further studies are required to identify the target and precise step that is targeted by AQ as well as derivatives of the drug that are least cytotoxic for treatment of DENV infected patient population.",

BHK-21 cells were infected with DENV2 (MOI of 1) and treated with AQ (5 \u00b5M) or no-AQ control (1% DMSO) during infection and post-infection. Cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 \u00b0C and intracellular and extracellular RNAs were analyzed by qPCR or by plaque assay as described under Materials and Methods. The relative amounts of viral RNA copy number or PFU in AQ-treated cells were calculated as % of the amounts in AQ-untreated cells. Each sample was tested in duplicate and results were confirmed by three independent experiments. Difference between AQ treated and 1% DMSO-treated groups derived from each approach was evaluated by paired t-test, two tailed. B. EC 90 values for inhibition of DENV2 infectivity by AQ.
