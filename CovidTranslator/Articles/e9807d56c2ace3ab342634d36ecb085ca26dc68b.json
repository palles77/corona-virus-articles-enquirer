            "text": "To understand the pathogenesis of diet-related and GI diseases of the rabbit, a thorough knowledge of the normal anatomic and physiologic aspects of rabbit digestion must be appreciated. Details of this are discussed in Chapter 14. In summary, rabbits have a unique digestive physiology. They are strict herbivores, but their digestive strategy differs from those of other hindgut or cecal fermenters (e.g., horses) and ruminants. Being a prey species of small size, rabbits rely on a high energy intake while at the same time having the ability to quickly eliminate fibrous waste that would otherwise have to be carried in the digestive tract. To accomplish this, the rabbit's cecum and colon have a well-developed mechanism for separating out the digestible and readily fermentable components of the diet while allowing the crude fiber components to be purged. The main driving force for this mechanism is the presence of large quantities of indigestible fiber. Lack of this fiber, either due to dietary inadequacies or conditions that cause anorexia, is the major cause of GI disease in rabbits. 12 Digesta are separated in the colon in a process of selective retention of fluid and small particles. Normal peristaltic movements propel the larger fiber particles through the colon, while contractions of the haustra in the colon move the fluid and small particles retrograde to the cecum. Small particles and fluid are retained in the cecum, allowing for extensive fermentation.",

            "text": "Cecal contents are expelled at regular intervals and reflexively consumed directly from the anus. Fiber stimulates cecocolic motility, either by a distention effect of the bulk, or directly. For example, diets high in fiber promote the production of specific volatile fatty acids in the cecum that directly promote peristalsis. 12 Inadequate ingestion of coarse, nondigestible fiber will inhibit normal GI peristalsis. Rabbits will ingest hair routinely in the process of grooming. However, unlike many other mammalian pets, rabbits cannot vomit to eliminate accumulated hair. If GI motility is normal, ingested hair moves along with food out of the stomach at regular intervals and is ultimately expelled in the feces. If GI motility is impaired, either as a result of inadequate fiber intake or ileus secondary to anorexia (stress, concurrent disease), hair and normal ingesta accumulate in the stomach. With this accumulation, fluid is absorbed from the stomach, further compacting the contents. Compacted ingesta may cause discomfort to the rabbit, contributing further to anorexia and exacerbating GI hypomotility. A vicious cycle can result, until large amounts of hair and compacted ingesta accumulate in the stomach. This accumulation is erroneously referred to as a \"hairball,\" \"wool block,\" or \"trichobezoar.\" These terms imply, incorrectly, that the hair accumulation is the cause of disease in the rabbit rather than simply being the consequence or a symptom of impaired intestinal motility.",

Diets low in fiber cause cecocolic hypomotility, prolonging the retention of digesta in the cecum and ultimately producing changes in cecal microflora. Populations of potentially pathogenic bacteria, primarily Clostridium species and coliform species such as Escherichia coli, are normally present in small numbers in the cecum. 9, 17, 21 A slowing of cecocolic motility leads to the production of abnormal cecal fermentation products and alterations in the cecal pH. Even mild alterations in cecal pH will cause an increase in these pathogens as the populations of normal organisms decrease. Similarly, a decrease in peristalsis in the small intestine will allow normally small populations of potentially pathogenic bacteria to proliferate. Overgrowth of these pathogens can cause a range of pathology from mild diarrhea to death from enterotoxemia. Other effects of fiber consumption are indirect. High-fiber diets have a low level of available carbohydrates and thus decrease the risk of enterotoxemia caused by carbohydrate overload of the hindgut. Carbohydrates provide an environment in which pathogens such as E. coli and Clostridium species proliferate. Glucose, a byproduct of carbohydrate digestion, is necessary for the production of iota toxin by Clostridium species. Thus, diarrhea and enterotoxemia in pet rabbits is often caused by this disruption in microflora, commonly referred to as dysbiosis.",

This acidic environment destroys most ingested bacterial pathogens, resulting in nearly sterile gastric contents. Ingested large-particle fibers, such as hay, mix with other foodstuffs to form a latticelike ball of food in the stomach. The lattice-like structure of this ball of food allows gastric acid to fully penetrate the ingesta and destroy bacteria. However, if a rabbit is fed primarily pelleted foods, a dense, compacted mass of food is formed in the stomach. The compacted nature of this food protects ingested bacteria from degradation by gastric acid, thus allowing potentially pathogenic bacteria to enter the small intestine. The combination of ingestion of pathogenic bacteria and slowing of intestinal motility as described above can result in clinical bacterial enteritis.",

The pelleted diets fed exclusively to feeder rabbits are high in calories (high in digestible carbohydrates), low in fiber, high in protein, and highly digestible, designed to increase weight gain in growing rabbits raised for their meat or fur. Commercial pellet formulations available for pet rabbits vary significantly in their protein, carbohydrate, and fiber contents. Formulations that contain a mix of dried fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, grains, and pellets generally have the lowest fiber content and the highest content of fat and carbohydrates. As the previous discussion indicates, there is significant potential for GI complications in a rabbit fed these diets. Similarly, rabbits routinely fed large amounts of high-carbohydrate, high-fat treats such as nuts, seeds, baked goods, and fruits are also predisposed to GI stasis. Acute episodes of GI stasis and dysbiosis are common following ingestion of a large volume of these treats. Rabbits at lowest risk are fed diets of unlimited grass or timothy hay, a moderate amount of fresh leafy greens, minimal commercial pellets, and occasional treats (see Chapter 14) .",

Obtain additional diagnostics as indicated to rule out suspected underlying disorders.

Visualization of a large, ingesta-filled stomach in a rabbit that has been anorexic for several days is suggestive ( Fig. 15-1 ). This contrasts sharply with the dilated gas and/or fluidfilled stomach observed radiographically in rabbits with acute GI dilation (bloat) (Fig. 15 -2) and can be helpful to differentiate the two disorders. Other common radiographic features seen in rabbits with GI stasis include moderate to severe distention of the intestines and cecum and scant fecal pellets.

Fluid therapy is essential to recovery. Administer fluids via either the intravenous or subcutaneous route, depending on the severity of dehydration. If they are anorexic for more than 1 to 2 days, affected rabbits are usually significantly dehydrated and generally require hospitalization for intravenous fluid therapy. Rehydrate the stomach contents by assisted feeding with a syringe or placing a nasogastric feeding tube (see Chapter 13) if the rabbit will not accept feeding slurries orally. A commercial product (Critical Care for Herbivores, Oxbow Pet Products, Murdock, NE) is available for this purpose, and most rabbits will readily accept this product when offered via a syringe. This formula is relatively high in fiber and will provide nutrition needed to stimulate GI motility in addition to rehydrating the stomach contents. If this formula is not available, blenderized pellets soaked with water or an oral electrolyte solution can be used. Feeding these slurries will also help to prevent hepatic lipidosis, which can develop rapidly in a rabbit with a negative energy balance. In addition to assisted feeding, offer rabbits water, plenty of fresh hay, and a variety of greens to provide every opportunity to self-feed. Ingestion of food is critical to reestablishing GI motility. Rabbits with GI stasis have mild to severe gut pain, especially if the intestines are distended with gas. Most will not begin to eat until this pain is alleviated. If the rabbit appears to be much in pain (reluctant to move, hunched posture, bruxism), administer buprenorphine (0.01-0.05 mg/kg SC, IV q6-12h) and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as meloxicam (Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc., St. Joseph, MO) (0.3-0.5 mg/kg SC q12-24h) or carprofen (1.0-2.2 mg/kg PO q12h). Rabbits feeling less pain may respond well to NSAIDs alone. Be certain that the rabbit is fully hydrated and no underlying renal disorders are present prior to administering NSAIDs.

The pathogenesis, history, and clinical findings differ significantly from those of GI stasis. Confusion arises over the use of the term trichobezoar. As discussed above, trichobezoar is a common misnomer for GI stasis. In most cases of acute GI dilation, the obstruction is located in the small intestine and is a compact mat of hair (trichobezoar). It is not clear exactly where these mats of hair are formed. They may have formed while still on the coat of the animal and have been ingested whole during grooming. It has also been suggested that these trichobezoars were once large cecal pellets containing compacted hair. They may occasionally be ingested and swallowed whole with other cecal contents during normal cechotrophy. 24, 25 Other foreign objects reported to acutely obstruct the intestinal tract include carpet or other cloth fibers, locust beans, and plastic. 24, 25 The location of the obstruction is usually in the proximal duodenum, a short distance from the pylorus where the lumen narrows, or in the midduodenum ( Fig. 15-3 ). The second most common location is the ileocecocolonic junction. Acute compressions of the intestinal tract by neoplasia, postsurgical adhesions, tapeworm cysts, and hernias have also been reported. 24, 25 These all create a complete physical obstruction of the intestines and are not related to functional GI stasis. Rabbits cannot vomit and have a well-developed cardiac sphincter. When outflow from the stomach is obstructed, gastric fluid and swallowed saliva quickly accumulate. This fluid may undergo fermentation to produce large volumes of gas, resulting in a rise in intragastric pressure and a severely dilated stomach. As with gastric dilation in other species, the combination of sequestered fluid, compression of the aorta and vena cava causing hypovolemic shock, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances can lead to death within hours of obstruction. Death can also be due to peritonitis resulting from ischemic necrosis at the site of the obstruction or rupture of the stomach.",

Unlike rabbits with GI stasis, there is no history of a recent stressful or painful event, and dietary history does not play a role. Affected rabbits suddenly refuse all food and quickly stop producing feces. Most demonstrate signs of severe pain, such as reluctance to move, hunched posture, and bruxism. As metabolic derangements and shock develop, affected rabbits become severely depressed, listless, laterally recumbent, and minimally responsive to external stimuli. With stomach rupture, they may suddenly cry out and die. On physical examination, a large, fluidfilled or tympanic stomach is palpable in the cranial abdomen. Pain is elicited on palpation of the stomach. If examined early, affected animals are alert but quiet, tachypneic, and tachycardic. Later, they become hypothermic, bradycardic, and hypotensive.",

Initial treatment goals are to decompress the stomach, treat shock, correct any fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and control pain. To control pain, administer buprenorphine (0.02-0.05 mg/kg SC, IV q6-12h). Sedation is necessary to decompress the stomach in most cases. Sedate with midazolam (0.5-1.0 mg/kg IM, IV) and/or mask with isoflurane or sevoflurane. A welllubricated 16-to 18-Fr red rubber catheter works well as an orogastric tube. It may be necessary to cut additional holes in the end of the tube to allow larger volumes of gas and fluid to pass. Measure the distance from the nose to the last rib (the distance to the stomach) and mark the tube. Lubricate the tube well and pass it gently per os into the stomach. Remove all gas and air from the stomach. Percutaneous trocharization of the stomach is not recommended as a method of decompression, since this will likely cause rupture of the stomach. While the stomach is being decompressed, place an intravenous catheter and begin treatment with a shock dose (90 mL/kg per hour) of isotonic crystalloid fluids. When dehydration is corrected and shock is controlled, reduce administration to a maintenance rate. Correct any electrolyte imbalances. In most instances, surgery is immediately necessary to remove the obstruction. However, in a small number of cases, the foreign object will pass following medical treatment. Monitor these rabbits closely to determine if the obstruction is passing. Palpate the abdomen frequently, monitor for signs of pain, and repeat radiographs. The gas pattern will change, and gas will be visible in the distal intestines if the rabbit is passing the obstruction. These rabbits will appear comfortable and begin eating, drinking, and defecating.",

Gastrotomies are generally better tolerated, with a lower probability of postoperative complications such as stricture, leakage, or GI stasis.

They are produced several times a day, usually in the morning and evening, and consumed reflexively directly from the rectum, a behavior termed cecotrophy. Cecotrophs are swallowed whole without chewing and are covered with a mucous coating that protects them from gastric degradation. This allows them to be delivered intact to the small intestines for digestion and absorption. Cecotrophs differ in appearance to rabbit fecal pellets. They are dark in color, soft and sticky in texture, have a characteristic odor, and are covered in a mucous layer. If intact, they appear as many soft fecal pellets stuck together, resembling a blackberry. If cecotrophs are not consumed, they often stick to the fur around the perineum or are found smeared on the fur and flooring. This is often confused with intermittent diarrhea and is a common presenting complaint. Rabbits that do not consume their cecotrophs are either physically unable to do so or do not eat them because they are abnormally formed. A common cause of inability to consume cecotrophs is obesity, where the rabbit cannot reach the anal region. Other causes include musculoskeletal disorders, dental disease, pain, and physical barriers such as Elizabethan collars. Changes in normal cecal motility, pH, or flora result in the production of abnormal cecotrophs. These cecotrophs may be soft, malformed, pasty, or odiferous and are therefore not consumed. Dietary deficiencies, as discussed above, are a common cause; however, other factors such as stress, concurrent disease, or antibiotic usage may also contribute.",

Cecoliths are the most common cause of lower bowel obstruction in the rabbit, lodging at the distal end of the sacculated portion of the large intestine, the fusus coli. Rabbits that form cecoliths often have a chronic history of cecal or large intestinal disorders including the production of large, malformed feces, recurrent cecal impaction, abdominal pain, and anorexia. Because affected rabbits are unable to form normal cecotrophs, they are often underweight and lack normal muscle mass. Many of these rabbits are serologically positive for Encephalitozoon cuniculi, and speculation exists that this parasite may play some role in the disorder. One of the present authors (JRJ) has also postulated that some of these rabbits may have neurologic damage associated with trauma to mesenteric nerves or spinal cord. A presumptive diagnosis of cecolith formation can be made by palpation of doughy to firm material in the cecum or colon. Radiography or ultrasound examination can be used to confirm the presence of cecoliths. If the intestine is completely obstructed, gas will accumulate in the sacculated large intestine.

The disease is not an important problem in these other species. 44 Histologic findings in these cases most often show a proliferative ileitis, with or without proliferative colitis, characterized by epithelial hyperplasia and mucosal inflammation. Similar disease in pigs and ferrets has been shown to be caused by a similar but distinctively different bacterium, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. 21, 36 Treatment of L. intracellularis in rabbits is challenging. Antibiotics used to treat L. intracellularis in other species include those of the macrolide family (e.g., tylocin, erythromycin, and lincomycin). These antibiotics are not recommended for use in rabbits. Chloramphenicol is generally efficacious and is administered at 30 to 50 mg/kg PO, SC q12h for 7 to 14 days. Florfenicol (NuFlor, Schering-Plough Animal Health Corp., Union, NJ) may be useful as an alternative antimicrobial agent in rabbits, but its efficacy and potential side effects in this species are yet to be evaluated.",

Stress (produced by overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, high temperatures, or breeding) may be an important component of this disease. Clinical signs of Tyzzer's disease include watery diarrhea, depression, and death. Morbidity and mortality rates may be especially high in weanling rabbits. Older rabbits can develop a more chronic form of the disease that results in chronic weight loss. Postmortem examination of rabbits with Tyzzer's disease may show characteristic foci of necrosis in the liver and degenerative lesions of the myocardium. More often, the intestinal wall is edematous, with areas of necrosis in the mucosa of the proximal colon. Treatment is palliative once clinical signs have been observed. The intracellular location of the bacteria may contribute to the difficulty in treating affected animals. If exposed animals are treated early (if they are isolated from affected animals, good hygiene is promoted; supportive care and a high-fiber diet are provided), they may not develop the disease. Once symptoms of the disease develop, treatment may be unsuccessful. Prevention of the disease depends on good husbandry. Bacterial spores are killed with a 0.3% sodium hypochlorite solution or with heating to 173\u00b0F (80\u00b0C) for 30 minutes.",

Although poorly studied in pet rabbits, antibodies to rotavirus as well as the virus itself have been found in the feces of rabbits from commercial rabbitries throughout the world. Severity of diarrhea associated with rotavirus infection varies widely and is likely influenced by synergy with various microorganisms associated with the infection. Severe anorexia, dehydration, and mucoid or greenish-yellow watery diarrhea have been reported. Rabbits between 30 and 80 days of age are most often affected. The mortality rate in young rabbits with naturally occurring infections may be as high as 80%. High morbiditiy and mortality rates found in naturally occurring infections have not been well reproduced in experimental studies. In one study, rotavirus caused soft or fluid feces in some rabbits, but in most animals diarrhea did not develop at all. 8 Another study showed that a strain of rotavirus induced diarrhea, depression, anorexia, and death; however, results of the experiment were not reproducible. 14, 15 The clinical signs of naturally occurring infections involving rotavirus and other agents include marked congestion and distention of the intestines and cecum and petechial hemorrhages in the small intestine and colon. Histologic lesions include moderate to severe villous atrophy, with the most severe lesions being found in the ileum. Apical enterocytes on the tips of villi are swollen, rounded, and desquamated, and the tips may be denuded. The lamina propria is usually infiltrated with lymphocytes and occasionally with neutrophils. Diagnosis is established on the basis of the results of histopathologic examination of the intestine, isolation of the virus, or demonstration of antibodies. Clinical signs and gross pathologic findings alone are not diagnostic. 13 The prevention and control of rotavirus infection is complicated by its highly infectious nature. Reduction of stress (by cessation of breeding, reduction of crowding, removal of socially dominant animals, and the addition of fiber to the diet) along with appropriate treatment of concurrent disease and improved hygiene should reduce mortality rates.",

RHDV specifically afflicts Oryctolagus cuniculus, the predominant species of domestic rabbits worldwide. RHDV does not cause disease in wild cottontail rabbits, jackrabbits, or hares. Since its first emergence in China in 1984, RHDV has become endemic in Europe, Cuba, Australia, and New Zealand. Limited outbreaks have occurred in the Middle East, South America, Mexico, and the United States. All outbreaks were traceable to the importation of live rabbits or rabbit products from China. The virus has been eradicated from Mexico. Sporadic outbreaks have taken place in the United States, the last of which occurred in Indiana in 2005. The disease was eradicated following each outbreak and as of this writing is not endemic in North America. 35 Clinical disease is seen in rabbits older than 2 months of age; younger rabbits are clinically unaffected. 18, 35 Virus is shed in urine, feces, and respiratory secretions. Transmission is via direct contact, contact with carcasses or fur from affected rabbits, or fomites such as water, feed, utensils, clothing, or cages. Flies and other insects may also serve as vectors, and the virus can be found in feces from predators that have eaten infected rabbits. RHDV is highly infectious and has traditionally been associated with high rates of both morbidity (40%-100%) and mortality (approaching 100%). Higher rates of morbidity and mortality are seen in naive populations. The number of rabbits affected during outbreaks peaks in 2 to 3 days and the disease course may last only 7 to 13 days.

Infection results from ingestion of sporulated oocysts that undergo excystation in the duodenum. Liberated sporozoites penetrate the intestinal mucosa and move to bile epithelial cells, where they undergo schizogony. Merozoites invade contiguous epithelial cells and undergo gametogeny, giving rise to microgametes and macrogametes. After being fertilized by a microgamete, the macrogamete develops into an oocyst. Oocysts rupture from the epithelial cells and are passed in the bile and eventually, in the feces. 28 Many infections are asymptomatic; however, the disease may be fatal, especially in young rabbits. Heavily infected rabbits show signs related to decreased hepatic function and bile duct obstruction. These rabbits become anorexic and debilitated; diarrhea or constipation may be noted in the terminal stages of the disease. The abdomen is occasionally enlarged and icterus is observed. Biochemical testing reveals increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bile acids, and total bilirubin. On radiographs, hepatomegaly and ascites may be present. On postmortem examination, the liver is enlarged and has yellowish-white, nodular, abscess-like lesions of varying size, some of which are within a fibrous capsule.

Clinical signs vary widely depending on the age of the rabbit, the organism involved, the parasitic burden, and the relative susceptibility of the animal (determined by factors such as age, stress, and diet). Subclinical infection is common in both young and adult rabbits. The finding of oocysts in clinically normal rabbits does not warrant treatment. Clinical signs are most often associated with poor husbandry or overcrowding and generally occur in rabbits under 6 months of age. Severely immunosuppressed older rabbits may also become symptomatic. Mild intermittent to severe diarrhea that may contain mucus or blood, weight loss, and dehydration may be observed. Animals with severe diarrhea may develop intussusception. Death is most often attributed to dehydration and secondary intestinal dysbiosis. Postmortem examination reveals lesions in the small or large intestine, depending on the agent involved.
