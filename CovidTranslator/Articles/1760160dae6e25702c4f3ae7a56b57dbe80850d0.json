The developed algorithm of face and eye localization in thermal images is presented in this paper, as well as some major problems connected with face localization in thermal images. Processing facial images has a wide range of applications, such as biometric identity authentication, human-computer interaction, multimedia, access control to secure computer networks and manual or automatic screening at airports. In medicine, a face detection system with visual images, or thermal images when temperature is important, can be used to detect disease in humans and also for robust and accurate human body temperature measurement with temperature measurement of the inner canthus of the eyes. The inner canthus of the eyes are suggested for temperature measurement utilizing infrared thermal imagers [1] , as it is the warmest area of the face. In Fig. 1 the face of the human with increased core temperature is presented. Many studies have proved that face detection in a thermal spectrum offers a few distinct advantages over the visible spectrum. Thermal imagery is independent of ambient lightning, because the Infrared Radiation (IR) sensors only measure the heat emitted by the object -the human body.",

            "text": "An excellent classification of the localization methods is proposed by Yang, Kriegman and Ahuya in [3] . The methods can be classified into four categories: template-matching methods [4] , knowledge-based methods [5] , feature invariant approaches [6] and appearance-based methods [7] . Many algorithms use combinations of the above methods to increase the effectiveness of face localization. Template-matching methods are based on predefined criteria or are parameterized by a function of the face pattern. In this way, the template for the eyes, nose, mouth and face can be used. The template is compared with the test image and the correlation values between these two images are computed. This approach is simple to implement, but there are many problems with variation in scale or pose. In [8] a novel approach for face localization based on the difference vector plus kernel principal component analysis is proposed. The difference vector is the difference between the original image and the common vector which is obtained by the images processed by the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. The result is derived from finding the minimum distance between the test difference feature vectors and the training difference feature vectors. The morphological method for face localization using fiducial points is presented in [9] . This method is independent of facial expressions. In the localization process, the fiducial points are fed as inputs into a back propagation neural network for learning and identification of a person. The human face can be recognized also by morphological shape decomposition [10, 11] , being the decomposition of an image object into a union of simple components using morphological operations, that is, erosion and dilation. In [12] a modification of the Hough transform can be found, which can deal with variations in scale or pose in a specified range. Next, are the knowledge-based methods based on the rules provided by the researcher. Put simply, a face often appears in an image with two eyes, a nose and a mouth. The distances and position are computed for selected components, for example, left and right eyes, and the relationship rule is examined. There are problems with defining the rules, because if the rule is too specific, than the face cannot pass the rule, otherwise if the rule is too general, it may give many results. Different approaches use feature-based methods, which are based on facial features and texture or skin color of the face. These algorithms are very sensitive to illumination and noise. Appearance methods are based on statistical analysis. One of the most effective methods is based on eigenfaces, in which the neural network computes a face description by approximating the eigenvectors of the image's autocorrelation matrix. Other methods have applied principal component analysis to face localization. In this method, the eigenfaces are generated from a set of training faces. Then, the similarity between the input face and the eigenfaces is computed. The localization of human faces in visual images is related to certain problems, such as pose, occlusion by another object, imaging condition or facial expression.",

            "text": "Thermal imagery [13, 14] is independent of ambient illumination since the human face and body emit thermal energy. The energy is emitted by any object above zero absolute temperature. Thermal energy is then registered by a detector, such as an FPA (Focal Plane Array) microbolometer, also data, defining the conditions of measurement (emissivity, ambient temperature, humidity, distance from the object), are registered and available for analysis or for processing algorithms. Identifying faces from thermal images has become an area of growing interest. In general, in many applications, the methods used in the IR-spectrum are based on wellknown visible-spectrum methods. The comparison of localization efficiency for thermal images and visible images was shown by Wilder et al. [15] . Among the statistical methods, the method of eigenfaces has been used successfully in the analysis of thermal images, increasing the efficiency of localization. Socolinsky and Selinger [16] compared the quality of face localization in video images and thermal images with the use of two basic statistical methods -PCA (Principle Component Analysis) and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis). Face localization issues in thermal images are discussed in [17] and Ring et al. discussed the problem of measuring human body temperature using thermal images [18] . The human body and the face are characterized by a specific average value of the temperature of about 30\u00b0C. Hence, it becomes a feature for effective localization and identification of a human face, which, in combination with some knowledge-based or templatematching methods, can be an effective instrument for automatic measurement of the temperature of the inner canthi. However, some requirements must be met, for example, fixed metrological parameters of the infrared thermal imager and constant measurement conditions (ambient temperature, humidity). Examples of the common problems in thermal imaging are shown in Fig. 2 .",

The ambient temperature was 23.3\u00b0C, relative humidity 44.0%, distance between the camera and the examined human varied between 0.5 and 3 m with 0.5 m steps. After the acquisition of the images, normalization was performed to attenuate objects surrounding the face. An example of normalization is presented in Fig. 10 . The distance between the human and the camera lens was varied to test different space filling in the image by the face (see Fig. 11 ), the proportion of the face to the image and for different resolutions of the region of interest -face and eyes. The influences of the other objects, such as other persons and heat sources, were minimized before starting the experiment. Also the distance between the camera and the walls must be such as to provide minimal influence from the thermal energy reflected by the walls. The tested persons were in the room for a minimum of 15 min before the experiment started and they did not wear glasses. Thermal images of the humans were taken only in the upright position, deviations in the vertical axis was a maximum 15\u00b0. For reference, the axillary temperature was measured simultaneously with the image acquisition. The parameters in the algorithm were chosen to maximize the quality of the final result. The first experiment was designed to determine the optimal distance between the examined human face and the thermal camera lens. The determinant of the optimal distance was the accuracy of the localization and the time complexity. The accuracy of localization for different regions of interest was made by comparing the set of pixels from the manual selection and the set of pixels identified by automatic region localization. Fifty per cent accuracy indicates that half of the pixels of the two sets of pixels are identical.",

The difference between temperature obtained from the algorithm and axilla temperature is the smallest for the 1.5 m distance and is about 0.1\u00b0C. Of course, this relationship will change once the infrared thermal imager is changed, particularly with different detector resolutions -when the resolution increases then the allowable distance also increases. This experiment shows that the best distance for temperature measurement is about 1.5 m. At distances greater than 1.5 m the number of pixels in the tested regions dramatically decreases; on the other hand, at distances of less than 1.5 m the field of view of the thermal camera should be considered. Fig. 13 represents the decreasing trend of the number of pixels, which is qualified by the algorithm of the inner canthus of the eye region. In conjunction with information from Table 1 , this shows the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The thermal image has 110 592 pixels, the algorithm gives good results for a set of pixels representing about 0.1% of the total number of pixels.",

The result confirms the HT theory, it is a very accurate method, but, in the standard form, the time complexity is unacceptable. The average time complexity of about 4 s results from the method of image analysis -every pixel in the image must be examined in 5-dimensional space. The proposed method decreases the time complexity with accuracy on a similar level as the RHT method. Simple calculations, based on selected face area with different number of pixels, show that the time complexity decreases linear with number of pixels. On the output of the proposed algorithm, we have a thermal image with marked regions, geometrical statistics and the temperature in the localized regions. For example, Fig. 14 shows an example of an output thermal image with marked regions of the face and the eyes. The calculated parameters are given. Ellipses of the face and eye regions are always models of the face, thus never perfectly matched to the shape of the real examined face. Geometric parameters of the face showed: O = (214, 150) pixels at the center of the ellipse and about 87\u00b0to be the angle of the vertical axis. Similar information is obtained for the left/right eye region and the left/right inner canthus of the eye.",
