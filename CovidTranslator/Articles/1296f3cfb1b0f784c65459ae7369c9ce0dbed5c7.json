The burden of disease, disability, and death caused by infectious diseases is felt around the world in both developed and developing nations. Moreover, the ability of infectious agents to destabilize populations, economies, and governments is strikingly apparent. To an unprecedented degree, infectious diseaserelated issues are high on the agendas of world leaders, philanthropists, policymakers, and the public. This enhanced focus, combined with recent scientific and technological advances, creates new opportunities and challenges for infectious disease research and practice. This paper examines these issues in the context of three countries: China, India, and the United States.",

It did not take into account critical factors such as the extraordinary increase in international travel and trade, and the movement of people into urban settings-many into mega-cities-where the spread of disease is amplified through crowding, poor sanitation, and inadequate hygiene. It also did not recognize that changing agricultural practices and environmental manipulations would dramatically alter disease vectors and opportunities for exposure. That early optimism did not reflect the continuing challenge of how to change behaviors that increase transmission and exposure, including risky sexual practices and intravenous drug use. In addition, it underestimated the extraordinary resilience and ability of microbes to change and adapt, and the continuing difficulty of ensuring that existing medical knowledge and tools translate into real-world care for anyone who needs it, whether because of inadequate resources, ignorance, or complacency. Sadly, it is now apparent that we also live in an era when we must prepare for the possibility of microbial agents being used intentionally as weapons to do harm [2] .",

We have also witnessed the re-emergence or resurgence of old diseases like West Nile disease, monkeypox, dengue fever, malaria, and TB, often in new geographic regions. In some cases, the resurgence of diseases like malaria and TB has come in new and more dangerous forms that are drug-resistant, which is becoming a serious problem worldwide. Unfortunately, the widespread and often inappropriate use of antimicrobials has led to the emergence of resistant strains of many microbes, complicating the management of a wide variety of diseases, and threatening future treatment options [2] .",

Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in the world, and hepatitis B and C account for about 80% of all liver cancers. In many of these cases, viral genes are necessary for the initial development of the tumor as well as for the continuing survival of tumor cells in the final malignant stage. This suggests there may be opportunities to prevent or possibly cure certain cancers through control of either the initial viral infection or through the inhibition of viral functions [6] . In fact, the use of hepatitis B vaccine has already resulted in a decreased incidence of liver cancer in certain populations [1] .",

The most prevalent disease is tuberculosis, followed by hepatitis B, dysentery, syphilis, and gonorrhea. According to official reports, these five diseases account for almost 88% of all reported cases [11] . Although overall prevalence remains relatively low, HIV/AIDS is fast becoming a major problem. As of the end of 2005, the Chinese Ministry of Health estimated that 650,000 people in China were infected, with an estimated 70,000 new HIV infections and 25,000 deaths that year [12] .

More recently, this lesson was brought home to China when SARS emerged in Guangdong Province in 2003 and spread rapidly throughout China and around the globe. Health authorities were unprepared, and serious deficiencies were revealed in China's ability to mount an effective, coordinated response. Early on, official efforts to conceal the extent of the emerging epidemic exacerbated the situation and critical time for disease identification and containment was lost. The consequences were devastating for China and the world; more than 8000 people were infected and some 800 died; cities were paralyzed for months; travel was disrupted; and the direct economic impact on other countries in the region was estimated to be as high as $30 billion [8] .

Synthetic biology offers important new strategies for drug discovery and design. Work at the intersection of these fields and cross-disciplinary approaches are increasingly critical. For example, because many important pathogens persist in animal reservoirs or may be transmitted to human hosts through other vectors, examination of important aspects of infectious disease transmission in these systems, including animal and human host resistance and susceptibility, vector efficiency, genetic variabilities, and population dynamics, will be essential.",

For example, continuing technology advances in DNA sequencing will make it possible to rapidly characterize more and more genomes, offering greater insights into basic composition and individual variation in both human and pathogen populations. The ability of genomics to support the development of increasingly rapid and reliable assessment tools like microarrays will be a huge asset to the swift diagnosis of infectious disease agents. Applications from the fields of robotics and informatics will facilitate rapid, high-throughput screening for new potential antimicrobial drug candidates. Information technology will enable large quantities of data to be rapidly mined, with a goal of more effective disease identification or trend tracking in real time that enables swift response.",

Research and development in those areas has special value because it is generally easier and more economical to study diseases where they are endemic. With respect to public health, such collaboration becomes imperative because of the transnational consequences of many of those infectious diseases. Fundamental knowledge about the nature of certain organisms and the diseases they cause, as well as opportunities for early detection, response, and control, can most effectively be achieved through broad-based collaboration. Such collaboration builds confidence and transparency and promotes sharing of data in a timely manner. This will strengthen the science base and opportunities for discovery, and amplify resources for meaningful action.
