Although considerable research has been conducted on source localization in steady-state indoor environments, very few studies have dealt with the more challenging source localization problems in dynamic indoor environments. This paper presents a comprehensive particle swarm optimization (CPSO) method to locate a contaminant source in dynamic indoor environments with mechanical ventilation and develops a multi-robot source localization system to experimentally validate the method. Three robots were used to test the presented method in a typical dynamic indoor environment with periodic swinging of the air supply louvers of a cabinet air conditioner. The presented method was validated with two typical source locations, DS (in the downwind zone) and RS (in the recirculation zone). For DS and RS, 15 and 14 experiments out of 15 experiments were successful, with success rates of 100% and 93.3%, and each robot moved an average of 24.4 and 23.6 steps, respectively. The presented method was also compared with the standard particle swarm optimization (SPSO) and wind utilization II (WUII) methods for locating the source at DS. For the SPSO and WUII methods, only 3 and 6 experiments out of 15 experiments were successful, with success rates of 20% and 40% and averages of 33.0 and 38.0 steps, respectively. The experimental results show that the presented method not only has a much higher success rate than the SPSO and WUII methods but also has higher source localization efficiency.",

In recent years, the continuous growth of the electronic information, aerospace, precision instrument, medical and health industries has greatly promoted the development of the clean room industry.

The main reasons are as follows: first, the air supply velocity of mechanical ventilation systems always fluctuates slightly; second, the air supply direction sometimes periodically swings up and down or left and right according to the needs of indoor personnel; and finally, various interference factors, such as the switching of ventilation modes, movement of personnel or equipment, and changes in heat source intensity, can disturb the indoor airflow field.

Stationary sensor network methods require the installation of one or more sensors in the indoor space in advance, after which the source location must be identified from sensor readings by using forward or backward models. Most of the available studies on stationary sensor network methods have focused on steady-state indoor environments [8, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (a detailed review is provided in [22, 23] ), and only very few attempts have been made to locate sources in dynamic indoor environments. Wang et al. [10] proposed an adjoint probability-based method for identifying the contaminant source location in dynamic indoor environments. The method was validated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and assumed that the simulated airflow data were consistent with those obtained in real-world conditions. However, most real-time dynamic airflows are difficult to accurately simulate by CFD models due to the uncertainty and complexity of dynamic airflows, which poses a great challenge to stationary sensor network methods.",

This type of method normally uses mobile robots equipped with gas or airflow sensors to initiatively track and locate release sources and decomposes the task of locating a source into three phases [26] : plume finding (contacting the gas), plume traversal (approaching the source), and source declaration (confirming the source). Compared to stationary sensor network methods, active olfaction methods have better adaptability in unknown environments because they can be executed by directly using sensor readings independent of numerical simulations; furthermore, active olfaction methods do not require environmental model construction and environmental sensor installation in advance. According to the number of robots used, this type of method can be divided into two categories: single-robot and multi-robot active olfaction methods. In recent years, multi-robot active olfaction methods have attracted increasing attention due to their high efficiency, good scalability, and strong robustness [27] .",

Compared to steady-state indoor environments, dynamic indoor environments pose two major challenges to robot active olfaction methods. First, the airflow velocity and direction at any position in the indoor space can fluctuate greatly with time, which not only makes it more difficult to accurately detect the airflow velocity and direction but also reduces the timeliness of the detected information. Therefore, the airflow velocity and direction are difficult to use in active olfaction methods. Second, the contaminant concentration distribution in indoor spaces can change greatly with time, which not only leads to the generation of more local extremum areas (where the concentration is higher than that in surrounding area) but also changes the locations of these local extremum areas. Therefore, variations in the contaminant concentration distribution will make it more difficult for the robots to continuously track the plume and easier for the robots to become trapped in local extremum areas.",

To overcome this drawback, we previously developed an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm by combining concentrations and airflows to enable robots to continuously track the plume [41] . However, this algorithm was only validated in steady-state indoor environments that were simulated by CFD. In this study, considering the complexity of airflow and concentration distributions in dynamic indoor environments, we present a comprehensive particle swarm optimization (CPSO) method that integrates the IPSO algorithm with a source confirming algorithm and a strategy for escaping from local extremum areas to improve the success rate and efficiency of source localization.

The singleboard computer controlled the robots through the robotics middleware Robot Operating System (ROS). The laser ranging radar system combined with the robot's own odometer for navigation and to determine the robot's location. Ultrasonic anemometers were used to collect air velocity and direction information, and gas sensors were used to measure the ethanol concentration. The detailed parameters are shown in Table 2 . Before each experiment began, the windows and doors were opened to remove the remaining ethanol vapor until the indoor ethanol concentration was less than 5 ppm.

The reason for this designation is first that this localization error (0.5 m) can generally meet the requirements of practical applications [44] ; second, when the source is close enough, the robots can use a camera or other device to determine the source location [45, 46] . Fig. 6 shows the airflow information measured for 300 s at the two source locations, DS and RS. As shown in the figure, the airflow direction fluctuated greatly at both DS and RS; the fluctuation at DS exhibited obvious periodicity, while the fluctuation at RS was chaotic. Moreover, the airflow velocity also fluctuated at both DS and RS. The magnitude of the airflow velocity fluctuation at DS was significantly larger than that at RS, and the airflow velocity at DS fluctuated periodically, while the airflow velocity at DS fluctuated chaotically. In addition, the time-averaged airflow velocity at DS was significantly higher than that at RS. The above results show that the airflow directions at both DS and RS fluctuated greatly; the airflow velocities at DS fluctuated more greatly than that at RS; the fluctuation in the airflow directions and velocities at DS exhibited obvious periodicity because this location was more affected by the air supply of the cabinet air conditioner.",

In each scenario, 15 independent experiments were conducted. As shown in Table 3 , for source location DS, the source was successfully located in all 15 experiments, and the success rate (the number of successful experiments divided by the number of total experiments) was 100%; for source location RS, 14 experiments were successful (only 1 experiment failed), and the success rate was 93.3%. These results indicated that the presented method is robust in a time-varying mechanical ventilation environment. Table 3 also lists the averages and standard deviations of the number of steps required to locate the source at DS and RS. Note that each robot moved by the same number of steps in each experiment. Therefore, the average is the average number of steps moved by any one of the robots in all successful experiments. For DS and RS, the average steps were very similar, and the difference between the points was less than one step. However, the standard deviation in steps for DS was slightly larger than that for RS. The larger the standard deviation is, the greater the dispersion of the data. The reason for the observed difference may be that the periodic swinging of the cabinet air conditioner louver from left to right causes periodic changes in the air supply; furthermore, the effect of air supply at DS is significantly greater than that at RS. In other words, the variation in the airflow and concentration field near DS over time is much larger than that near RS. Fig. 7 shows the source localization process of the robots (R1-R3) and the maximum time-averaged concentration collected by the robots at each step in a typical successful experiment (the video of the experiment is provided in the supplemental material). In this experiment, each robot moved 27 steps. After the robots departed, they first found the plume, then tracked the plume and continuously confirmed whether they had found the source during the tracking process. From finding the plume to finally locating the source, the main stages experienced by the robots are becoming trapped in a local extremum area, escaping from the local extremum area, rediscovering the plume, and then tracking the plume.",

            "text": "This study presented a comprehensive particle swarm optimization method (CPSO) for locating a contaminant source in timevarying indoor airflow environments with mechanical ventilation. This method uses an IPSO algorithm that combines concentration and airflow information to enable the robots to continuously track the plume. In addition, this method integrates a source confirming algorithm and divergence search strategy to guide the robots to escape from local extremum areas and finally find the source. The effectiveness of the method was validated by three robots in a typical time-varying airflow environment with the air supply louvers of a cabinet air conditioner periodically swinging from left to right. Moreover, the performance of the method was compared with the standard particle swarm optimization (SPSO) and wind utilization II (WUII) methods in the experimental environment. The experimental results led to the following conclusions:",

            "text": "(1) For the two typical source locations, DS (in the downwind zone) and RS (in the recirculation zone), 15 and 14 experiments were successful, respectively, out of 15 experiments using the presented method (the corresponding success rates were 100% and 93.3%), indicating that the method has a high success rate and strong robustness in a timevarying airflow environment with mechanical ventilation. For DS and RS, the average numbers of steps moved by each robot were very close, 24.4 steps and 23.6 steps, respectively, and the standard deviations were 6.6 steps and 4.0 steps, respectively. The standard deviation in steps for DS was slightly higher than that for RS, indicating that the airflow and concentration fields near DS were more affected by the periodic swinging of the cabinet air conditioner louver than those near RS, which caused the larger difference in steps obtained when locating the source at DS. (2) Analysis of the source localization processes in the experiments shows that the presented method confers the robots a good ability to continuously track the plume and the ability to successfully escape from a local extremum area and continue to approach the source location when they are trapped in such an area. In the experiment, due to the periodic change in the air supply direction of the cabinet air conditioner, the airflow direction and contaminant concentration near the source fluctuated greatly with time, which not only increased the difficulty of continuously tracking the plume but also may lead to misjudgment of the source confirming algorithm based on the maximum concentration method. (3) For the source location at DS, 15 experiments were conducted by using the CPSO, SPSO and WUII methods, with 15, 3 and 6 successful experiments; success rates of 100%, 20% and 40%; averages of 24.4, 33.0, and 38.0 steps for source localization; and standard deviations of 6.62, 5.57 and 5.14 steps, respectively. The experimental results show that the presented method not only has a much higher success rate than the SPSO and WUII methods but also has higher source localization efficiency.",
