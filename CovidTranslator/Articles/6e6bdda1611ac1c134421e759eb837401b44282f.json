We present a route proposal that shows how the community pharmacist may develop his responsibility to contribute to the early detection and appropriate referral of possible cases of the COVID-19. In the route have been considered three possible entrances depending on the needs of the users: anti-flu drugs, symptoms related to COVID-19 infection or the request for items for hygiene and prevention of transmission such as alcohol and face masks. Later, self-care education should be given, and the possible cases should be reported to the telephone lines designated by the mayor or the governor, continuing the healthcare process.

Therefore, community pharmacies may contribute to avoid or minimize the last stage of \"community transmission\". In this way, on February 5th, 2020, the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) issued the \"Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak: Information and interim guidelines for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce\" to provide relevant information and guidelines on coronavirus outbreaks for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce. 2 The FIP also notes that \"community pharmacies in outbreak-affected and unaffected countries are often the first point of contact with the health system for those with health related concerns or simply in need of information and reliable advice\". 2 In addition, a recent article concluded that: \"community pharmacists have a key role in preventing the spread of 2019-CoV virus. They are charged with key responsibilities of informing, advising and educating the community, maintaining a stable supply of pharmaceuticals and personal hygiene products, and screening of suspected cases and making appropriate referral as required\". 3 Consequently, we present a route proposal that shows how the community pharmacist may develop his responsibility to contribute to the early detection and appropriate referral of possible cases of the COVID-19, whit the goal to contribute to prevention of the overall community spread of the virus in Colombia (Fig. 1) .",

We https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.007 Received 16 March 2020; Accepted 16 March 2020 must take into account that in Colombia, the community pharmacies -pharmacies located in the neighborhoods and drugstores-are not articulated with the health system, therefore it is necessary to connect them to the process of healthcare that has been implemented to attend the possible cases of COVID-19. Hence, the aim of this route proposal is to coordinate the community pharmacy process with a unique route of healthcare for the detection and management of COVID-19 cases, in local, regional or national instances.",
