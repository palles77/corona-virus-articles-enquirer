Here common sense dictates that every precaution be taken against infusion-borne infection. With other groups of patients, the right policy seems less easy to determine. Even if the filters were equipped with a screw fitting to end the leakage difficulties, their unsuitability for all types of fluids, which is a considerable nuisance, would remain. When large volumes are given (peritoneal dialysis, burns) significant numbers of rubber, plastic, and glass particles are delivered to the patients. For these and other patients we do need better filtering capacity, and ideally one built in to the drip sets. The Ivex 2 does not seem to be the answer. A compromise between pore size and practicality is needed-i.e., a porosity that permits all kinds of fluids but holds back at least medium-to-large particles and maybe some bacteria as well.",

Where white wines are drunk, this species of colic is very frequent ... viz., in Alsace ... there are likewise in those parts a greater number of gouty and nephritic patients ... I have suspected the cause to have been the taenia Sulphurata dulcis ... bismuth and lead.\" Tanquerel des Planches2 who first described uric-acid stones in lead poisoning credited Wepser with identifying lead in wine as the cause of epidemic colic in 1671. In 1863 Lanceraux3 reported that lead induces interstitial nephritis and further noted that albuminuria is by no means constant in lead nephropathy. Innumerable subsequent studies over the past century have made it clear that lead nephropathy is characterised by the absence of proteinuria.4 The editorial misstatement is particularly unfortunate because it tends to perpetuate the myth that proteinuria can be used to detect lead nephropathy. On May 27, an 18-month-old chimpanzee in a zoo developed slight diarrhoea and anorexia. Faeces collected 2 days later contained small numbers of rotavirus particles. On May 28 a 15-month-old gorilla in the same cage began to vomit and later had diarrhoea. She was quite ill and did not return to normal health for 5 days. Fseces collected 12 h after onset contained large numbers of rotavirus particles.",
