Furthermore, the last quarter century has seen an explosion of new questions and ideas, stimulated by developments in the computer and cognitive sciences. Competing ideas about probability are often driven by different intuitions about the nature of belief that arise from the needs of different domains (e.g., economics, management theory, engineering, medicine, the life sciences etc). Taking medicine as our focus we develop three lines of argument (historical, practical and cognitive) that suggest that traditional views of probability cannot accommodate all the competing demands and diverse constraints that arise in complex real-world domains. A model of uncertain reasoning based on a form of logical argumentation appears to unify many diverse ideas. The model has precursors in informal discussions of argumentation due to Toulmin, and the notion of logical probability advocated by Keynes, but recent developments in artificial intelligence and cognitive science suggest ways of resolving epistemological and technical issues that they could not address.

The need for a formal solution to these problems has been recognised as a major scientific and technical challenge for at least 400 years, and in the last 30 years discussions have been further stimulated by problems arising in the cognitive and computer sciences. Perhaps the most influential and admired work on these matters has been carried out by mathematicians and logicians, often informed by problems in some practical domain such as medicine or economics (e.g., [14] ). This has led to a mathematical theory of probability having great power and intellectual depth. Yet despite this the field of probability theory has been dogged by philosophical and technical disputes. As Kyburg [18] has observed \"Many proponents of many [different] views have argued that their interpretation of probability is the correct (or the most useful, or the only useful) interpretation\".",

This research programme adopts a more eclectic methodology than is usual in theoretical discussions of probability and logic. Among the methods used have been observation of naturally occurring behaviour (e.g. the behaviour of doctors making clinical decisions); computer simulation of software agents carrying out complex tasks, and empirical testing of the performance of such agents making decisions and plans in real medical settings. The paper concludes that our continuing failure to resolve well known issues about probability, and the new challenges raised by the cognitive sciences, point to the need for a fresh approach, and develops a system that has intuitive appeal, theoretical coherence and considerable practical versatility.",

In Section 1.1 I put forward three independent lines of argument that there are important shortcomings in conventional accounts of how agents can accommodate uncertainty in achieving their objectives, viz: philosophical and technical issues come up repeatedly in discussions of uncertainty and do not look like being resolved (the historical argument); standard methods and technologies provide insufficient means for solving real-world decision problems (the practical argument), and challenges raised by the need for theories of autonomous functioning in artificial intelligence and psychology (the cognitive or \"anthropic\" argument). Section 1.2 presents a framework for resolving these difficulties through an account of reasoning about uncertainty and belief that explicates the role of \"knowledge-based argument\" in reasoning, decision-making and other cognitive processes. Section 1.3 summarises the main conclusions.",

In Ian Hacking's celebrated account The Emergence of Probability [12] we are told that ideas about uncertainty existed by Roman times and became increasingly explicit and diverse through the medieval period and the renaissance. But that they seem to have been at best vague and conceptually rather muddled until the modern concept of probability appeared in a correspondence between Pascal and Fermat, and the central ideas were pub-lished in the Port Royal Logic in 1660. Hacking asks why it took so long for the modern notion of probability to develop, and whether particular technical and historical circumstances were necessary for it to appear. He provides a wide-ranging discussion of the many concepts that were competing for this conceptual space, from chance to fate, deductive to inductive reasoning, and from intuitive ideas about possibility to modern theories of probability.",

The collection of disease and death rates and other data (by de Witt, Wilkins, Petty, Graunt and others in the mid 1600s) stimulated quantitative ideas about uncertainty, risk and prediction. Once the basic idea of probability had taken root many famous figures got involved in its development (including Leibniz, Bernoulli, Laplace, Huygens, Poisson, to name just a few). In the period from the mid 19th century through the 20th techniques developed rapidly, leading to modern statistics and much other applied mathematics.",

Although we have a deep technical understanding of mathematical probability it is now generally accepted that it is a subject with many subtleties, and many philosophical questions about its relationship with ideas about human belief and rationality have been raised and debated. Recent discussions have involved some of the leading intellects of the modern period, including Ramsay, Savage, Russell, Popper and, a name we will hear more of, the economist John Maynard Keynes. Their attention was attracted because arguments about probability were not merely technically challenging, they often directly impacted on fundamental human concerns of politics and economics, belief, and the nature of mind.",

We take the Port Royal Logic as the first point at which the primary dimensions of Hacking's space are identifiable. The first of these dimensions concerns a very old distinction between events that recur in random or apparently unlawful ways, and those that occur reliably, and for which there is some sort of developed theory. The fall of a fair die cannot be predicted while the position of a planet can. Writers speak of circumstances of the first kind with many words, such as \"chance\", \"fate\", \"hazard\" and so forth. These terms may involve subtle distinctions but they are generally grouped under the heading \"aleatory\", meaning \"Dependent on chance, luck, or an uncertain outcome\". 1 This is to be contrasted with an understanding of events in the world through some kind of scientific discourse that draws upon theories about the world, such as causal or geometrical theories and in which the usual modes of reasoning are categorical, logical and deductive.

            "text": "The second dimension of the Hacking space concerns the distinction between objective probability and subjective probability. Hacking spends a considerable amount of time 2 getting to grips with a set of ideas that were around by the seventeenth century and perhaps earlier, which were concerned with \"possibility\" (as distinct from probability). These terms seem to have become a focus of dispute in the 18th century, with some scholars arguing that possibility is different from probability (e.g., Leibniz and Laplace), and others arguing that it is identical. Hacking relates this discussion to an earlier scholarly debate about de re and de dicto modes of language, where the former refers to statements about aspects of the world (e.g., \"it is possible for Daniel to get to San Francisco by noon\") and the latter about what can be said or known (e.g., \"it is possible that Daniel is there now\"). Hacking seems to come down on the side of those who regard possibility and probability as equivalent. Indeed he links the de re mode with the aleatory aspect of probability (chance, and hence possibility, is a property of the world) and the de dicto mode with the epistemic aspect (i.e., an aspect of our knowledge of the world) though to my way of thinking the objectivesubjective distinction remains intact. 3 Despite the apparent simplicity of the two primary dimensions of the Hacking space many believe that this is still too complicated and have argued for an even more parsimonious interpretation of probability since a simpler semantics and avoidance of psychological issues should yield practical tools that are both more general and easier to use. In the most influential view probability is viewed as a universal measure that can represent all uncertainty and belief. The \"Bayesian\" probabilists have been particularly active in this area due to their wish to move away from a strictly frequentistic concept of probability based on empirical observations. The simplification is achieved in three moves. First, it is asserted that all uncertainty about a proposition can be represented by a single number representing a degree of belief in that proposition. This is conventionally a point in the [0, 1] interval 4 whose properties are defined by the probability axioms. Second, the aleatory-epistemic dimension is collapsed by treating all empirical chances as probabilities, and treating epistemic reasoning (e.g., reasoning based on deductive logics) as a special case of probabilistic reasoning in which only two degrees of belief are permitted, 1.0 and 0. These points are viewed as equivalent to \"true\" and \"false\" in classical logic. Third, the philosophical complications of the objective-subjective distinction are finessed by assuming that subjective probabilities are technically no different from objective ones and therefore subject to the same theorems. Claims that human judgement and decision-making may take place without use of explicit probabilities is discounted by insisting that all decision makers have a personal probability for all possible states of the world, which can be revealed by forcing the decision maker to gamble on alternative options.",

Doubts commonly arise on the grounds that ideas about uncertainty and belief are far more varied than a simple probability account permits. There are many different formalisms and calculi for representing uncertainty for example (e.g., [13, 16, 21] ) and, more importantly, there may be different kinds of uncertainty (e.g., [24] ). From an everyday point of view many humans claim a rich phenomenology of uncertainty, distinguishing between such notions as belief and doubt; suspicion and conviction; possibility, probability, plausibility, . . . vagueness, ignorance, . . . and so on. If we follow those who reject the need for such distinctions then it seems to me that we get into deep water. From a psychological or linguistic perspective we should at the very least explain the remarkable fact that there is an enormous number of uncertainty terms in our natural language.

The very existence of such locutions suggests a rich and functional diversity in the cognitive states that lie behind human language and thought. Surely we possess this rich vocabulary for a reason? Among the possible benefits of such terms are that they have both a representational role, capturing our confidence in some proposition, and also a communicational role, succinctly indicating something about the provenance of a proposition in terms of the logical and cognitive justifications on which it depends. We develop these ideas in detail later.

We just have a much larger knowledge base on which to ground a greater repertoire of arguments for what we believe. Warrants are the ancient conceptual structures that Hacking alludes to. They share an important feature with modern argumentation in that they are grounded in some body of prior knowledge (e.g., medicine) and some accepted mode of reasoning (e.g., authority or testimony, causal or statistical modes of inference). This suggests that any understanding of ideas like uncertainty, belief, doubt and so forth is incomplete without an account of the reasons for an agent's beliefs (or doubts); the \"warrants\" of earlier times and the \"arguments\" of today.

Under these circumstances we need a theory of reasoning under uncertainty that tolerates the absence of quantitative data, provides an account of how to structure the decisions and modify this as circumstances change. In the rest of this section we address the first problem and turn to the second in the next. 7 Three examples of medical \"decision support systems\" are now outlined. These illustrate some common decisions that doctors face and show how they can be addressed with a non-probabilistic approach (Fig. 2) . The decisions do not depend upon the availability of precise probabilities and/or utilities but largely on qualitative or at most \"semi-quantitative\" rules. In these systems the specific argumentation processes are mathematically ad hoc yet the applications have proved to be surprisingly successful and robust; in Section 1.2 we shall describe a principled framework in which to build these and other argumentation systems.",

The rules are formalised as rules in first-order logic. When the system is invoked the rules are instantiated with information from the patient notes and with knowledge from the drug database. The system then generates a list of candidate treatments based on its drug knowledge, and applies the rules in order to construct arguments for and against each option. For example, if CAPSULE is considering drug A and drug A is relatively cheap by comparison with the alternatives this is an argument in favour of A. On the other hand if the patient is already taking drug B and B is known to have an undesirable interaction with A then this is an argument against A. CAPSULEs rules cover 9 factors, including knowledge of drug efficacy, contra-indications, drug interactions, side effects and relative costs. Finally, CAPSULE simply counts up the arguments for and against each drug and presents the set of candidates in an order based on the ratio of pros to cons (Fig. 2) . A controlled study with practicing doctors showed that 7 These subjects can only be dealt with briefly here: They are developed in more detail in (Fox and Glasspool, forthcoming). 8 Computer Aided Prescribing Using Logic Engineering.

Plans decompose into collections of tasks which may yield new information and hence new goals in a cyclical process carried out over time [7] . Formal investigations of the nature of uncertainty have been carried out in many fields, from the higher realms of logic and statistics to the \"low sciences\" of medicine and commerce. In the last 40 years or so we have seen the rise of a new strand in western scientific thought, that of \"cognitive science\". Cognitive science is an umbrella term for a number of disciplines, a number of which share the scientific objective of understanding intelligence, as exemplified by the human mind or by robots and other artificial agents that implement complex cognitive functions like reasoning, decision-making, natural language and the possession of knowledge. Cognitive science has become a new driver for discussion of ideas about uncertainty and belief. Among the most prominent areas of cognitive science where novel ideas are emerging, are psychology and AI.",

As a method of reasoning classical logics, such as the standard propositional and predicate logics, are powerful, but do not directly represent any uncertainty that may be encountered in practical domains. Classical logics do not represent degrees of truth or accommodate changes of mind or relative truth (when a proposition is viewed as true from one point of view but false from another). Our approach is based on a more familiar type of reasoning than has traditionally been studied by logicians.

When we look at decision-making in domains like medicine we come across similar problems to those noticed by Toulmin. First, medical professionals have to make decisions in situations where they are not certain about information and its evidential significance, but it is impractical to precisely state their degree of uncertainty. They may suspect that a patient is at risk but have little basis for quantifying the likelihood of the hazard. Second, in many settings we must deal with apparent inconsistencies, as when we are faced with a patient who is clearly ill but a routine lab-test shows nothing abnormal, or in one clinician's opinion the patient is suffering from one condition but has a different diagnosis in the opinion of another.",

In probability theory we have an analogous constraint that if there is evidence that increases the probability of hypothesis H then this necessarily implies a reduction in the probability of \u00acH. In the version of LA in Table 2 the not-introduction schema serves an analogous function. If we assume that some claim \u03d5 is the case, but this leads to a contradiction with some confidence Q then this entails the existence of an argument with confidence Q in the complementary claim \u00ac\u03d5. In the clinical systems described above this axiom is not enforced. This is because when eliciting knowledge from clinicians there is a strong tendency to describe positive associations between symptoms and diseases, while symptom absence is not interpreted. Such systems are therefore more similar in spirit to systems based on intuitionistic logic, which also excludes the EM axiom, than classical logic though formalisations of LA like that above can have standard axioms and theorems.",

Since we can construct arguments that are purely symbolic under the rules of LA (e.g., arguments that increase confidence in a claim but do not indicate by how much) the aggregation process is less obvious. However, suppose we have three supporting (+) arguments for one claim, two supporting arguments for another, and just one argument for a third then there is an obvious natural order over the claims even though we have provided no quantitative interpretation of the level of support provided by each argument. This aggregation is justified by the \"principle of insufficient reason\" introduced by Keynes, which says that if an agent has no reason to assign different levels of confidence to competing hypotheses it may reasonably assign equal levels of confidence. A minor variant of this principle warrants assigning equal levels of confidence to all arguments if there is no reason to do otherwise.",

I would add a further possible function for the many linguistic terms that we use to talk about our beliefs.

A common view of such terms in logic is to treat them as modals, basing their semantics on a possible-world formulation. This is a well-developed position but expensive in the sense that modal logics have well known difficulties compared with standard predicate logic, and proving such logics as mathematically sound and complete is time-consuming and demanding. This may be an important thing to do if you are a logician, but not if you are trying to understand the use of modals in natural language or trying to build an agent that can use modal terms in its reasoning and user interface My position is that these so-called modal terms are \"epistemic states\", predicates that evaluate properties of collections of arguments about claims. The use of epistemic states may be mathematically ad hoc yet they provide a useful vocabulary for an agent to reflect upon its beliefs and their justification, and communicate succinctly with other agents about the confidence to be attached to its claims. In this respect we follow John McCarthy in his article \"Modality, Si! Modal logic, No!\" where he remarks \"Human practice introduces new modalities on an ad hoc basis. . . . Introducing new modalities should involve no more fuss than introducing a new predicate. In particular, human-level AI requires that programs be able to introduce modalities when this is appropriate\" [19] .",

However this position has often been questioned on a variety of grounds and the issues never seem to be quite settled. The rise of the cognitive sciences in the last quarter century has led to an explosion of new questions about the sufficiency of probability theory for dealing with problems in artificial intelligence, psychology, linguistics and other areas concerned with the nature of cognitive agents. Three lines of argument (historical, practical and anthropic) have been presented which support the view that traditional formalisations of probability leave important questions about uncertainty and belief unresolved. An account of knowledge and decision-making based on logical argumentation has been presented that appears to unify diverse intuitions about the nature of probability and belief. These discussions are substantiated by examples from clinical medicine. However, there are few truly new ideas in this field and previous discussions by Keynes, Hacking, Toulmin, Simon and others suggest that the problems and proposals discussed here are not specific to the medical domain. The central claim is that some general form of argumentation underpins all the competing ideas about probability, and developments in artificial intelligence and non-classical logics suggest ways of formalising this class of system in order to resolve some of the epistemological and technical issues that they were not in a position to address.",
