The deaths cases reached 4 12,784 with estimated case-fatality rate ranges from 0.5 to 5.7%. Children are the 5 least affected population by the disease, while the highest rate of death is among 6 elderly and people with comorbidities. The majority of infected individuals are 7 asymptomatic or only with mild symptoms. After the incubation period, the most 8 common symptoms are fever, cough, and fatigue. Asymptomatic carrier state is of 9 paramount importance due to their ability to spread the infection and shedding the 10 virus into air and surroundings. Although much is still unknown about SARS-CoV-2, 11 the scientific research progresses in an unprecedented pace toward understanding the 12 nature, effective control, prevention, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Various reports 13 have suggested an in vivo evolution of the virus which may explain the rapid spread 14 and changing epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 but further evidences are needed. 15 Unfortunately, no effective treatment or therapeutic drug is available for the disease 16 and only supportive treatment and classical intervention measures are the available 17 choices for confronting SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",

            "text": "diseases are frequent public health threats owing to their potentials to 41 develop from small outbreaks to epidemics and pandemics. On 31 December 2019, 42 Chinese health authorities announced dozens of pneumonia infections in Wuhan city 43 (Hubei province) without a recognized aetiology [1]. The first reported cases of 44 pneumonia in Wuhan had a previous history of visiting or association with a local 45 seafood market where wildlife animals are sold. The infectious agent was 46 subsequently identified on January 12 as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) envisaged 47 to be originated from Huanan seafood market [2]. Due to its high similarity in terms 48 of clinical symptoms and biological nature with the causative agent of sever acute 49 respiratory syndrome (SARS), the novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 by the 50 International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. After rapid isolation of the virus 51 on January 7, genome sequence became publically available and submitted on ://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.2). Phylogenetic analyses showed 54 that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two SARS-coronaviruses of bat origin, bat-55 SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, but distant from human SARS-CoV (79% 56 sequence homology) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus 57 (MERS-CoV) (50%) [3,4]. Epidemiological investigations showed that different 58 animals (Bats, pangolins, snakes) could have been intermediate hosts that facilitate 59 the spill-over of SARS-CoV-2 as a distinct human Betacoronavirus from bats to 60 human population [4-6]. 61 Since February 26, the reported new cases outside China are surpassing the cases 62 being reported in China mainland [7]. Currently, the numbers are increasing rapidly 63 specially in European region with overwhelming deaths in Italy. Till March 22, the 64 total cases of infections were 292,142 in 189 countries around the globe with 65 approximately 12,784 deaths cases. Reports show that adults and elderly are the most 66 infected by SARS-CoV-2, with slight predominance in men, while only low 67 proportion of paediatrics had contracted the infection [8-10]. Moreover, the presence 68 of previous diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular or respiratory malfunction 69 significantly affects the outcomes. Indeed, being elderly or delay in diagnosis were70",

            "text": ", recent studies support the evolution of the virus by successive 137 mutations and recombination processes[26,27]. Comparative studies of genomes138 sequenced from European cases compared to previously sequenced genomes in China 139 are needed to verify the previous findings.140 By March, the number of new cases in China are getting low with time, while Italy 141 and Iran are the new hotspots from which new infections are disseminated to the 142 nearby countries. In the Middle East and central Europe, the reported cases to WHO 143 are growing with time (Figure 2). In the European continent, the total confirmed 144 cases reach 141,858 and 7,319 deaths until March 22 (10:00 CET) [28]. According to 145 the epidemiological data by Italian Higher Institute of Health (ISS), the mortality rate 146 (5.4%) is higher than of China (2.3%) and total deaths in Italy exceeded the number 147 8 documented in China. This may be attributed to the fact that most infected individuals 148 are the elderly in addition to the incapacity of healthcare system to cope up with the 149 rapid increase of new cases [23]. 150 Turning into a pandemic 151 Unlike its precedent SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 had unique characteristics and 152 chances to become a pandemic. First, the initial case definition set be Chinese CDC 153 (CCDC) was narrow and based solely on pneumonia signs. Subsequent analysis of 154 the first cases showed about 81% of cases have mild disease, which undoubtedly 155 increased the transmission within the community by the asymptomatic carrier state 156 [10]. The WHO estimated the mortality rate to be between 3 and 4% with increased 157 value for elderly or individuals with previous comorbidities. Due to the lack of data 158 regarding the true number of infected individuals worldwide, it is still early to 159 calculate the exact value of mortality rate. Second, the current definition (March 22) 160 of suspected case set by WHO is a patient with any acute respiratory illness and 161 having been in contact with a confirmed or probable SARS-COV-2 case in the last 14 162 days prior to onset of symptoms. The above definition is based on reports calculated 163 the incubation period to range from 1 to 14 days [29]. However, recent reports found 164 an incubation period might be as long as 24 days [30,31]. This period is much more 165 than the 14 days used by WHO for guidance the quarantine policies, consequently, 166 truly infected persons may be missed during their long incubation period and 167 contribute to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, international surveillance 168 estimated that up to two-thirds of exported case from China went undetected [32]. 9 Third, the containment measure was challenging in the first phase of the outbreak in 170 Wuhan due to its high population, immense trade and wide travel connections within 171 China and the world. Furthermore, the industry, commerce, and travel of China with 172 the rest of the world has doubled since 2000 which aided SARS-CoV-2 quick spread 173 [33,34]. The Spring Festival and Lunar Year events also believed to played a critical 174 role in SARS-CoV-2 spread within China and the region as millions of Wuhan 175 dwellers travelled out of the city before the lockdown measure implementation and 176 just after the outbreak. The same situation applies for Europe where international 177 travel and business are intense and free travel within the Eurozone is permitted. The 178 exact underlying reason(s) for the ongoing rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe is 179 still unknown. The suspected in vivo evolution of the virus and transmission by 180 asymptomatic carriers may be major factors. [27,35,36].181 Fourth, in SARS-CoV-2 infections, shedding of virions starts earlier than clinical 182 manifestations and shedding peak is still unknown [37]. Isolation of individuals after 183 symptoms onset will be too late and transmission to others would already occurred 184 during the incubation period [30,38]. Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 185 from asymptomatic cases was documented in first clusters in Germany and Vietnam 186 during early February [39,40]. Dependence on temperature for ruling out 187 asymptomatic carriers as it used during SARS containment deemed inefficient in 188 SARS-CoV-2 [41]. Additionally, the R 0 value of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than of 189 SARS (3.28 vs 2.2) [20,21]. High transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is obvious by a 190 global increase of more than 72,000 cases in three days according to WHO reports 191 (from March 18 to 20) [7]. 192 Pathology and clinical features 193 SARS-CoV-2 exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2), same 194 receptor of SARS, in lower respiratory tract of human for entry into lung cells 195 [42,43]. Cellular surface serine protease TMPRSS2 is also employed by SARS-CoV-196 2 for priming of spike protein S to facilities membrane fusion with host cell [42]. 197 ACE2 is also prevalent on other cells outside lung [44]. The exact pathophysiology of 198 SARS-CoV-2 and its closely related outbreaks-associated coronaviruses remains 199 elusive. Cytokines storm and viral evasion of cell-mediated immune response play 200 important roles in pathogenesis and disease severity [45]. Higher levels of 201 inflammatory chemokines and cytokines (GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, TNF\u03b1, and 202 other interleukins) result in lung injury that requires urgent admission to intensive 203 care units [8]. 204 Children are the least affected population by the disease, however, this observation 205 might be biased by low number of sampled children in the earlier reports. Moreover, 206 children have less contact with potential sources due to fewer outdoor activities and 207parental protection. Some scholars believe that immune system of children develops 208 less intense cytokines storm or their respiratory tracts are healthier because they have 209 not been exposed to pollutants as adults, yet supporting evidences are still features of pneumonia including fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, and 213 fatigue. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a feature in severe cases.214Other symptoms include productive cough, headache, haemoptysis, and diarrhoea 215 were also documented [8]. A report from the CCDC estimated that only 5% are 216 critically ill (e.g., with shock, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, or 217 multiple organ dysfunction), 14% of patients had severe pneumonia (e.g., shortness 218 of breath, low oxygen saturation, or had more than 50% of their lung parenchyma 219 involved on chest imaging within 1-2 days). Meanwhile, most patients (81%) showed 220 no or mild pneumonia[10]. The overall case-fatality rate was 2.3 percent, however,221 case-fatality rate between 5.8 percent in Wuhan to 0.7 percent in the rest of China 222 were reported. Fortunately, no deaths were reported among noncritical cases [46]. 223 Leukocyte count in most cases shows lymphopenia, nonetheless, total white cell 224 count may be low or higher than normal. D-dimer, prothrombin time, hepatic 225 transaminases and procalcitonin are high among critically ill patients. Abnormal chest 226 radiographic features were seen in almost all patients [8]. Bilateral patchy shadows 227 are frequently seen on chest X-ray, while ground glass opacifications (GGO) are 228 found in cases with ARDS. Typical CT findings include; multiple GGO with or 229 without reticular pattern, and parenchymal consolidations involving both lungs 230 [47,48]. Other common CT features include; microvascular dilatation, thick interlobar 231 septa and air bronchogram [48]. Interestingly, CT changes have also been seen in 232 patients before the onset of clinical symptoms and before viral RNA detection from 233 upper respiratory specimens [49]. Time required for recovery ranges from 2 weeks in 234 mild infections to 3-6 weeks in severe disease. Extrapulmonary complications include 235 acute injuries in heart, liver, and kidneys are known [9,50]. 236 Diagnosis 237 Travel history is no longer valid as a criterion to build the diagnosis on since local 238 transmission account for the majority of infection acquisition expected in locations 239 where no cases have been identified previously. The clinical manifestations 240 accompanied by radiographic evaluation and laboratory diagnosis (detection of viral 241 RNA) are the only possible approach for definitive diagnosis [51]. Generalizations 242 regarding symptoms and laboratory indices still cannot be drawn because SARS-243 CoV-2 pathology and its reflections are still not completely understood. Due to 244 variations in epidemiology and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infections, 245 physicians and specialists are highly recommended to continually update their 246 management strategies based on WHO interim guidelines for diagnosis and cases 247 definitions (suspected, probable, and confirmed).248 The most convenient laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is the real-time 249 reverse transcriptase-PCR (rRT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal specimens. A regularly 250 updated source for various protocols based on rRT-PCR assay is available at WHO 251 website [52]. As in any diagnostic test, false positive and false negative results have 252 been reported but at very low frequency [30]. According to CDC recommendations, 253 the accepted clinical specimens are bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasopharyngeal 254 13 swabs (but not throat swabs), and blood [53]. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were 255 found superior to other respiratory specimens (positive rate 93%) followed by sputum 256 (72%), nasal swab (63%), fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy (46%), pharyngeal swab 257 (32%), and faeces (29%) [54]. Due to the increasing number of healthcare-associated 258 infections, strict adherence to usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and 259 airborne precautions is highly recommended. A concise guide for healthcare staff, 260 researcher, and public health workers has been published [55]. 261 Confronting the pandemic 262 In the absence of specific therapy and anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, the urgent 263 implementation of classical public health measures are the only reliable actions to 264 mitigate the pandemic and gradual control of infection spread. A very recent small-265 sized clinical trial has found promising results for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in 266 France. The administration of 600 mg of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin on 267 daily basis resulted in effective clearance of the virus from the nasopharynx within 268 six days [56]. The mechanism of action is the alkalinisation of epithelial 269 phagolysosome containing the virus. These results are founding the current 270 therapeutic protocol in IHU M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection, France. Further large-sized 271 ongoing clinical trials (including hydroxychloroquine among other drugs) will 272 provide further pieces of evidence for treatment options.273 The rigorous and gigantic efforts of China in implementing public measures are 274 obviously effective as new cases are declining steeply. Indeed, China have applied 275 14 the largest quarantine in history to contain the disease, hence, cut of person-to-person 276 transmission chain, isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and community 277 containment are the only promising measures to fight SARS-CoV-2. As a respiratory 278 virus with substantial transmissibility, applying of social distancing to reduce 279 interactions between people in a mass scale is beneficial especially when detection of 280 cases is swift [57]. If the community transmission continued in expansion, social 281 distancing would be insufficient and community containment would be needed. The 282 efficiency of community containment is apparent in China where normal daily life is 283 gradually being sustained recently in Wuhan after a significant decline of cases. 284 Nonetheless, such measure is challenging and requires a partnership with local and 285 state officials of different fields. Media should also tap their abilities to communicate 286 with trusted information about containment benefits and pre-empt false rumours and 287 panic. 288 As the world witnessing a significant decline in new cases in China, the will of 289 political and healthcare authorities should push forward to implement a lockdown of 290 hotspot zones and a comprehensive tracing of contacts associated with confirmed 291 cases. The cost of wide tracking and community containment would not be 292 outweighed by the long-term economic losses and disease burden if the transmission 293 continued. Additionally, rapid responses and decision making alongside free or at 294 least affordable laboratory testing will facilitate the delineation of hotspot zones. 295 Certain community containment procedures such as cancellation of public events and 296 closure of institutions are seen in numerous countries. These precautions will not be 297 15 fruitful unless parallel thorough surveillance accompanied by medical observation 298 and legal actions are taken if quarantine violations occurred. Recently, Italy, France, 299 and Spain, and Philippines started the implementation of lockdown measures, with 300 law enforcement in some cases, to control the overwhelming increase in cases. In 301 third-world countries, lockdown measure is extremely challenging owing to the high 302 proportion of low-wage jobs where workers seek opportunities at daily basis. Finally, 303 efficient deactivation of different coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2 was not evaluated) 304 was reported with disinfectants such as 62 -71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 305 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute and this efficacy is highly expected to 306 apply for SARS-CoV-2 [58]. 307 Issues to be investigated 308 Despite the intense research and clinical investigations, certain issues of SARS-CoV-309 2 pandemic await exploration. Fist, the origin of the virus and the nature of spill-over 310 from its natural reservoir to human is still unanswered. It is known that bats and 311 Pangolins are hunted for food in China but this has not be confirmed so far to be the 312 cause [6]. Moreover, viral replication and human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 313 are still largely unknown. Second, the virus was detected in faecal samples from 314 infected patients and its potentials for oral-faecal transmissibility is still unaddressed 315 by researchers [54,59,60]. Third, the phylogenetic analyses have shown genomic 316 variations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in different countries through 317 different periods. Whether the in vivo evolution occurs in human or other 318 intermediate animal host is still unproven. Indeed, the existence and identity of an 319 16 intermediate host is highly expected with few evidences but not experimentally 320 proven. Fourth, the period for which SARS-CoV-2 virion retains its infectivity when 321 shed and deposited on surfaces and environment is also unclear. Indeed, the efficacy 322 of hand washing in deactivating SARS-CoV-2 virion has not been tested. Fifth, the 323 reason of predominance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in men is also not known. 324 Smoking habit in Asian men populations was expected to be the underlying cause, 325 but no solid evidence is yet available [61]. Sixth, the initial administration of 326 corticosteroids during early stage of SARS epidemic was justified by their mitigation 327 of inflammatory response but subsequently halted due to delay in viral clearance [62]. 328 Lately, a small-sized (n=201) observational study reported that methylprednisolone 329 treatment was associated with decrease in death risk of patients with ARDS [63]. 330 Whether the same effects of corticosteroids happen in SARS-CoVof SARS-CoV-2 globally is expected to multiply especially in poor 334 nations. Genomic, virological, and medical analyses are progressing in unprecedented 335 strides. Such analyses are expected to contribute to understanding of epidemiology, 336 pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention. Suspected case definition is expected to get 337 revised at any moment, hence, medical staff and epidemiologists should be keep 338 updated for better control of the pandemic. Moreover, they are also highly advised to 339 employ protective measures since they are at-risk populations due to exposure to 340 infection nosocomially. The clinical manifestations varied widely and mild or 341 asymptomatic cases may not seek a medical care and go undetected and exacerbate 342 transmission scenario. The exact routes of pathogenesis, transmission and pandemic 343 dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 are under intense investigation. Till now, classical 344 public health measures and control intervention are the only way to fight SARS-CoV-Structure and genome organization of SARS-CoV-2. (A) General 557 structure of SARS-CoV-2 virion. (B) Genome composition of SARS-CoV-2 showing 558 fourteen open reading frames exist in SARS-CoV-2 genome. The first two ORFs at 559 the 5\u02b9-UTR are coding for polyprotein (pp1a/ab) required for viral replication 560 28 followed by structural proteins for Spike (S), membrane (M), Nucleoprotein (N). At 561 the 3\u02b9-terminus accessory genes (3a, 3b, p6, 7a, 7b, 8b, 9b, and orf14) are located 562 with flanking ORFs. Accessory proteins not required for viral replication or other 563 known functions (adopted from reference [3] with permission). Reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 from March 1 -21. (A) Total confirmed 566 cases in all regions of the world. (B) Newly reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 in most 567 affected countries (with cases > 8,000). (The numbers are retrieved from WHO 568 situation reports).",
