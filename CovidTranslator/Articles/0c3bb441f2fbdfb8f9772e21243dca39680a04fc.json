            "text": "K-and H-Ras are the most commonly mutated genes in human tumors and are critical for conferring and maintaining the oncogenic phenotype in tumors with poor prognoses. Here, we design genetically encoded antibody-like ligands (intrabodies) that recognize active, GTP-bound K-and H-Ras. These ligands, which use the 10th domain of human fibronectin as their scaffold, are stable inside the cells and when fused with a fluorescent protein label, the constitutively active G12V mutant H-Ras. Primary selection of ligands against Ras with mRNA display resulted in an intrabody (termed RasIn1) that binds with a K D of 2.1 \u03bcM to H-Ras(G12V) (GTP), excellent state selectivity, and remarkable specificity for K-and H-Ras. RasIn1 recognizes residues in the Switch I region of Ras, similar to Raf-RBD, and competes with Raf-RBD for binding. An affinity maturation selection based on RasIn1 resulted in RasIn2, which binds with a K D of 120 nM and also retains excellent state selectivity. Both of these intrabodies colocalize with H-Ras, K-Ras, and G12V mutants inside the cells, providing new potential tools to monitor and modulate Rasmediated signaling. Finally, RasIn1 and Rasin2 both display selectivity for the G12V mutants as compared with wild-type Ras providing a potential route for mutant selective recognition of Ras.",

Missense mutations in human Ras were some of the first oncogenes ever discovered, with two groups reporting that the G12V mutation in H-Ras transforms cell lines [5, 6] . Ras overactivation is associated with 71% of pancreatic cancers, 35% of colon cancers, and 19% of lung cancers [4] . Thus, molecules that could regulate oncogenic Ras function would be of immense value as targeted therapeutics. However, despite decades of extensive research, there are currently no therapies directly targeting Ras. As a result, Ras continues to be considered as an \"undruggable target\" [7] .",

These fibronectins are selective for the active state of Ras and are specific for Ras over homologous proteins. At the same time, these fibronectins bind both H-and K-Ras-GTP selectively for mutants. Furthermore, Rasin1 and Rasin2 are functional when expressed inside the cells, and RasIn2 and Rafkinase RBD domain (Raf-RBD) (the canonical binding partner of Ras [25] ) bind Ras-GTP with comparable affinity. against human K-Ras(G12V) that had been exchanged with GTP\u03b3S to create bias for binders to the active state of the target (Fig. 1b) . Target specific binding was first detected in round 4 (Fig. 1b) . To increase state-selective binding for active Ras, we added a 15-fold molar excess of K-Ras(G12V)-GDP in solution that would compete and remove molecules that were not specific for active Ras during the affinity enrichment step in rounds 5 and 6. The resulting pool 6 has 23% binding to K-Ras(G12V)-GTP, 16% binding to K-Ras(G12V)-GDP, and no detectable binding to the selection matrix (neutravidin-agarose or streptavidinagarose beads; Fig. 1b) . Thus, pool 6 shows a measurable preference for the GTP-bound form of K-Ras(G12V). We then sequenced pool 6 using high-throughput sequencing techniques and ranked the selected sequences by their abundance to determine the sequences that were enriched during selection (data not shown).",

In this assay, the target protein is localized to the Golgi as a fusion protein bearing (1) a Golgitargeting sequence (GTS), (2) streptavidin (SA), and (3) the target [here, H-Ras(G12V)]. We chose H-Ras for this screen to find those molecules that were Ras specific and would be able to bind to both K-and H-Ras. We also utilized the constitutively active H-Ras(G12V) mutant in order to find state-specific Ras binders that would not be downregulated by endogenous RasGAP that might be present in the COS cells (CV-1 in Origin, and carrying SV40 genetic material). Each candidate was screened as an eGFP fusion that was cotransfected with the target. Candidates were scored for colocalization with the target by immunocytochemistry. The best-performing candidate targeting H-Ras(G12V) was termed RasIn1 (Fig. 1c and d) . Images of the COS cells demonstrate that eGFP-labeled RasIn1 (green) and Golgi-targeted SA-H-Ras(G12V) (visualized with rhodamine-biotin; red) accurately colocalize (merged, yellow) with little excess staining elsewhere in the cell. This result indicates that RasIn1 (1) expresses stably and functionally in mammalian cells (COS cells) and (2) has low background and little, nonspecific localization in the rest of the cell. Importantly, this low background binding demonstrates that RasIn1 accurately recognizes H-Ras in the complex environment inside the cytosol.",

The ability to discriminate between Ras and Rap1B(G12V) bears comment, as these proteins are 57% sequence identical and the Ras Switch I region (YPDTIED) differs by switching 2 aa from the Rap1B Switch I region (YDPTIED).

In the cell-based assay, wild-type H-Ras shows poor binding and colocalization, while the H-Ras(G12V) mutant shows good colocalization and binding (Fig. 4) . One possible explanation for this observation is that RasIn1 has higher binding for H-Ras(G12V) than wild-type H-Ras. Alternatively, wild-type H-Ras may exist in the cell in a predominantly inactive, GDP-bound state due to downregulation by endogenous Ras-GAP. This hypothesis is consistent with the wild-type protein being a substrate for hydrolysis via endogenous Ras-GAP, whereas the mutant is not [30] .",

Alternatively, some colocalization could be from the binding of RasIn2 to the GDP-bound state of H-Ras, possibly due to the high expression levels of transfected RasIn2 and H-Ras present in the cell. We note that colocalization with active Ras can be observed with RasIn1 inside the cells even though the K D is ~2.1 uM (Fig. 4) , and in vitro RasIn2 has similar affinity for the GDP form of Ras as RasIn1 has for active H-Ras(G12V)-GTP (Fig. 6b ).",

Unlike previously generated ligands that bind to Ras, both RasIn1 and RasIn2 satisfy these criteria. RasIn1 has a K D of 2.1 \u03bcM, a reasonable outcome from a primary selection with 17 random/randomized residues. It is notable that this affinity is sufficient to provide very good colocalization with the intended target in the COS cells, even though this affinity is less than the downstream partner Raf-RBD for the active state of Ras (K D = 80 nM). RasIn1 also has excellent nucleotide, mutant, and homolog selectivity, showing little or no binding to Ras-GDP (Fig.  2a) or Rap1B-GTP (Fig. 3b) . This result is remarkable because Ras and Rap1B are 57% sequence identical, and the Switch I sequences of Ras (YPDTIED) and Rap1B (YDPTIED) differ by only 2 aa (bold). Mutation and competition analysis of the RasIn1 indicates that the binding overlaps the known Ras binding site for Raf-RBD, although the precise sequence interactions must be different-the recognition sequences overall show basic character (R/K rich) and have no sequence homology [32] .",

RasIn2 gives substantially improved pull-down with Ras compared to RasIn1 (Fig. 6b) , competes with Raf-RBD (Fig. 7b) , shows broad recognition biochemically of K-Ras(G12V)-GTP, wild-type K-Ras-GTP, H-Ras(G12V)-GTP, and wild-type H-Ras-GTP (Fig. 7a) , outperforms RBD in an ELISA assay (Fig. 8) , and also shows excellent colocalization with H-Ras(G12V) and wild-type H-Ras inside COS cells (Fig. 9 ). The fact that RasIn1 and RasIn2 show similar intensity in the COS cell assay is likely a result of the high transient expression levels of both the binder (RasIn) and the target (Ras) in the COS cells.",

RasIn1 or RasIn2 could also be developed into active Ras biosensors for in vitro or in vivo studies, histology, or cancer diagnostics. Their small size, high affinity, lack of disulfide bonds, state selectivity, Ras specificity, and ability to be transfected into cells lend RasIn1 and RasIn2 to a wide range of possible future uses that often restrict the application of antibodies or non-genetically encoded molecules.
