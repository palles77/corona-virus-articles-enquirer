These interactions occur within a larger protein complex or within a given nanoenvironment. To illustrate this complexity empirically, we developed a protocol to analyze FRET among more than two fluorescent proteins (multi-FRET). In multi-FRET, we model FRET among more than two fluorophores as the sum of all possible pairwise interactions within the complex. We validated our assumption by demonstrating that FRET among pairs within a fluorescent triplet resembled FRET between each pair measured in the absence of the third fluorophore. FRET between two receptor chains increases with increasing FRET between the ligand-binding chain (e.g., IFN-R1, IL-10R1 and IFN-R1) and an acylated fluorescent protein that preferentially resides within subsections of the plasma membrane. The interaction of IL-10R2 with IFN-R1 or IL-10R1 results in decreased FRET between IL-10R2 and the acylated fluorescent protein.",

Although it is important to use chemically defined and well-controlled conditions to study interactions between two proteins in detail, these interactions occur in the context of entire complexes and in living cells, and may be modified in these more complex environments.

With this methodology, we estimated the energy flow through the donor:acceptor system through three possible paths: (1) into donor and out from donor, (2) into donor toward acceptor and out from acceptor, and (3) into acceptor and out from acceptor. Dissecting the energy flow allowed a determination of not only a more accurate FRET efficiency but also the acceptor:donor molar ratio, the relative levels of donors, of acceptors, and of donor:acceptor complexes, the coupling efficiencies of donors or acceptors into complexes, and the relative affinities of interactions within cells [6] . This methodology helped to explain a phenomenon in which (when coexpressing cDNAs encoding human IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c, the two transmembrane receptor chains of the Type I IFN receptor complex, in hamster cell lines) biologically active human Type I IFN receptors were much less easily generated in hamster cells lines than were IFN-receptors [7] . The efficient preassociation and the bioactivity of the Type I IFN receptor complexes depended on balanced expression of the two transmembrane receptor chains (IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c), and is aided by the coexpression of Janus kinases and/or the scaffolding protein RACK-1 bound to the intracellular domains of the receptor chains. Similar requirements may also exist for the IFN-receptor complex (composed of IFN-R1 and IL-10R2).",

When they are isolated in vitro from cells, they are defined as detergent-resistant membranes. Lipid rafts have distinct biophysical properties (e.g., increased viscosity) and likely form a distinct physical phase in the membrane from those of aggregates formed by other lipid molecules [11, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Lipid rafts are likely to be quasi-stable -although these lipid rafts are physically separated from other sections of the plasma membrane on a low-nanometer scale, individual rafts are not clearly resolved using visible-light optics nor are they stationary on a high-nanometer scale. Like oil droplets in turbulent water, individual rafts may fuse or dissociate. Individual rafts may also grow or shrink as many of their constituents partition into non-raft domains easily and thus readily diffuse between the membrane phases. Even with metastable lipid rafts, confinement of receptors to these lipid rafts will increase the frequency with which they encounter each other as well as interact. Using a fluorescent probe that localizes to these rafts with a technology that has a nanometer range of detection like FRET will allow one to measure the colocalization of proteins within these small and dynamic regions (nanocolocalization).",

We expanded our two-protein CFS protocol [6] to delineate energy flow through a three-protein or four-protein system from a two-protein system by exciting samples with not two but rather three or four lasers, each preferentially exciting one of the three or four proteins. After some algebraic manipulation, we determined various FRET efficiencies by estimating the fraction of energy that went through the 7 or 15 possible energy pathways.",

As described in Supplementary Text 3, all three fluorescent are simultaneously visible, even while the levels of all three proteins vary among cells. We compared the distribution of FRET efficiencies within the populations between the two fluorescent proteins that are common to both populations (TFP and CiFP, TFP and ToFP, and CiFP and ToFP respectively). In all cases, the datasets overlapped, demonstrating that our analysis of threeprotein FRET can be used to obtain accurate pairwise FRET efficiencies in intact cells using our methodology. We observed here and elsewhere [6] , that Lyn-ToFP exhibits FRET with IFN-R1/TFP at far lower numbers of complexes than Lyn-ToFP does with IFN-R2/CiFP; inferring stronger restriction of IFN-R1 than IFN-R2 within membranes to where Lyn-ToFP nano-localizes.",

We chose these triplets to determine (1) whether the localization of IFN-R1 or IFN-R2 to lipid raft subdomains of the membrane differ when the two chains are dissociated or when they interact, (2) whether the scaffolding protein RACK-1 [36] [37] [38] [39] that stabilizes the interaction between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c [7] interacts differently with IFN-R2c, IFN-R1, or IFN-R2c:IFN-R1 complexes, and (3) whether a dominant negative IFN-R2 chain [40, 41] inhibits the assembly or the activation of the IFN-receptor complex. We confirmed that fusions of GFP variants to the COOHtermini of cytokine receptor chains did not inhibit their functionality [2, 7] , and that fusion of TFP to RACK-1 did not affects its ability to influence the interaction between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c [7] ; as this research was performed, a manuscript was published in which a COOH-terminal fusion of GFP to the nematode RACK-1 was successfully used [42] .",

This implies that the interaction between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2 is aided by (if not requires) the localization of IFN-R1 within subsections of the membrane to which Lyn binds.

Altogether, these data suggest that RACK-1 (that directly binds IFN-R2c, Jak1, and Tyk2, but only indirectly binds IFN-R1 via its interaction with Tyk2 [36] [37] [38] ) increases its FRET with IFN-R1 as a consequence of IFN-R2c interacting simultaneously with IFN-R1 and RACK-1. The cooperative interaction among the three proteins may explain how RACK-1 stabilizes the interaction between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c [7] .",

These data suggest that IFN-R1 interacts with IFN-R2/ R2b only when it can also interact with IFN-R2, implying that IFN-R2 and IFN-R2/ R2b interact with IFN-R1 under similar conditions and may compete with each other directly for IFN-R1. IFN-decreased the FRET efficiency between IFN-R1/CiFP and either IFN-R2/StFP or IFN-R2/ R2b/TFP to no more than 35% and 20% respectively (Fig. 2G , I, open circles), but only when all three chains were present (data not shown). Additional unpublished experiments revealed that in the absence of IFN-, IFN-R2/ R2b/TFP did not alter the affinity between IFN-R2/StFP and IFN-R1/CiFP, suggesting that it does not inhibit the assembly of the IFN-receptor.

More interestingly, as FRET between IFN-R1 or IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 increases, FRET between IL-10R2 and Lyn-ToFP decreases ( Fig. 3B and E) . This suggests that a conformational change in IL-10R2 that disfavors FRET with Lyn-ToFP occurs when IL-10R2 interacts with IL-10R1 or IFN-R1. Finally, increasing FRET between IFN-R1 and IL-10R2 correlates with increasing FRET between IFN-R1 and Lyn-ToFP in most cells (Fig. 3C ). This suggests that, like IFN-R1, IFN-R1 must colocalize within lipid rafts to interact with IL-10R2. The same pattern was observed with IL-10R1, IL-10R2 and Lyn-ToFP (Fig. 3F) , implying that IL-10R1 must also be present in lipid rafts to interact with IL-10R2. Because IFN-R1 and IL-10R1 are homologous to IFN-R1 [43] , we believe that we are observing a general requirement of inclusion of the ligand-binding receptor chain within lipid rafts to interact effectively with the accessory receptor chain. In Supplementary Text 5, we investigate whether Jak1, that binds IFN-R1, IFN-R1, IL-10R1 and IFN-R2c, influences the interaction between IFN-R1 and either lipid rafts or IFN-R2.",

We first observed that IFN-R1 exhibits higher FRET with Lyn-ToFP than its homologous chains IFN-R2 or IL-10R2 did (cf. Fig. 3G , H with Figs. 2A, B, 3A, B, D and E). As seen with the IFN-receptor chains, there was no correlation of FRET between Lyn-ToFP and IFN-R1 and FRET between Lyn-ToFP and IFN-R2c (Fig. 3G ). There also appeared initially to be no correlation between FRET between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c and FRET between IFN-R1 and Lyn-ToFP (Fig. 3H) . Interestingly, when FRET between IFN-R2c and Lyn-ToFP was measured as a function of FRET between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c, the data fell into two distinct groups: The typical pattern of FRET between IFN-R2c and Lyn-ToFP increasing with increasing FRET between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c was seen in one subgroup (Fig. 3I , filled black circles); in the second subpopulation, FRET between IFN-R2c and Lyn-ToFP remained poor even while FRET between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c increased (Fig. 3I, unfilled circles) . When we identified these cells in Fig. 3G and H, we found that FRET between Lyn-ToFP and IFN-R1 increases as FRET between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c increased in most of the cells in this subpopulation (Fig. 3H , unfilled black circles). Excluding this subpopulation, there is a tendency for FRET between IFN-R1 and Lyn-ToFP to decrease as FRET between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c increases (Fig. 3H , filled black circles). We hypothesize that in some cells a component interacting with both IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c alters the conformation of both chains so that FRET between one receptor chain and Lyn-ToFP is favored while FRET between the other receptor chain and Lyn-ToFP is disfavored. In Supplementary Text 6, we provide evidence that this component is RACK-1.",

We hypothesized that when FRET between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2 (or between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c) increases as the two chains interact, that FRET between proteins \"on opposite sides\" (i.e., Jak1 and Tyk2, IFN-R1 and Jak2) should also increase. To test this, we analyzed FRET among four proteins of the IFN-receptor complex, and among the four proteins of the IFN-receptor complex as a function of FRET between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2 or between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c. We fused TFP and CiFP to the COOH-termini of the Janus kinases because the greatest sequence variation occurs there, the NH 2 terminus is involved in interactions with the receptor chain; also, it was shown that a fusion of GFP to the COOH terminus of Tyk2 is biologically functional [46] .",

Although this approach is similar to ours, they did not account for internal conversion in their determination of FRET efficiencies. Aside from incorrectly defining FRET efficiency, this results in an overestimation of FRET efficiencies by reducing the magnitude of the denominator. Additionally, they define FRET from FP1 directly and only from the 3-FRET definition; these produced data with FRET from FP1 being lower within the triplet than in the isolated pairs [47] ; inferred distances from FP1 to other proteins will therefore be overestimated.

Because both IFN-R1 and IFN-R2 reside within the plasma membrane, we chose as a third fluorophore a fatty acylated peptide conjugated to ToFP, and chose to investigate the nano-localization of IFN-receptors within plasma membranes. Because we have little empirical control over how efficiently IFN-R1 and IFN-R2 interact in cells or how well either chain associates with lipid rafts, a technology like multi-FRET that can distinguish among the interaction of Lyn-ToFP and either IFN-R1, IFN-R2, or an IFN-R1:IFN-R2 complex, is ideally suited to address our interests.",

Analyzing various triplets in this fashion allowed us to observe circumstances in which particular pairs of proteins interact. In one triplet, we clearly observed that considerable FRET between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2 correlated with considerable FRET between IFN-R1 and Lyn-ToFP (Fig. 2C ). This implied that IFN-R2 interacts with IFN-R1 only when IFN-R1 is found within membrane subregions to which Lyn interacts, such as lipid rafts. In another triplet, we discovered that FRET between RACK-1 and IFN-R1 (that do not directly interact [36] [37] [38] ) increased with increasing FRET between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c (Fig. 2E ) or with increasing FRET between RACK-1 and IFN-R2c (Fig. 2F ). This result is consistent with a model in which RACK-1 associated more strongly with complexes of IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c than with either chain in isolation. In a third triplet, we observed that the dominant negative receptor chain IFN-R2/ R2b interacted with IFN-R1 only when IFN-R2 also interacted with IFN-R1 (Fig.  2H) , implying that IFN-R2 and IFN-R2/ R2b interact with IFN-R1 by the same mechanism.",

First, FRET between IFN-R1 and Lyn-ToFP was more efficient than FRET between Lyn-ToFP and either IFN-R2 and IL-10R2. These data implied that IFN-R1 partitions into lipid rafts. This implication is consistent with a report describing the palmitoylation of IFN-R2c but especially of IFN-R1 [48] ; this may constrain both chains to lipid rafts. Second, in addition to the expected population in which FRET between IFN-R2 and IFN-R1 increased with increasing FRET between IFN-R2c and Lyn-ToFP (Fig.  3I, filled circles) , there was a population in which FRET between IFN-R2c and Lyn remained poor irrespective of FRET between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c (Fig. 3I , unfilled circles).

The cosedimentation of both IFN-R1 and IFN-R2 with GM 1 in vitro has been shown by a few groups [49] [50] [51] , inferring their presence within lipid rafts in intact cells. One study showed that the association of IFN-R1 with detergent-resistant membranes (scored by binding of cholera toxin B to the ganglioside GM 1 ) is only partial prior to ligand addition, and increases significantly after treatment of cells with ligand [50] . This result agrees with data stating that photocrosslinking of sphingomyelins with IFN-R1 increases after IFNtreatment [52] . Another study found strong colocalization of IFN-R1 with lipid rafts in intact cells as well as in detergent-resistant membranes in vitro that did not increase after binding IFN-; the localization of IFN-R2 with lipid rafts as well as its cosedimentation with detergent-resistant membranes was partial prior to ligand treatment but increased after IFN-treatment [51] . These studies uniformly use nonneutralizing antibodies raised against IFN-R1 or against IFN-R2. In contrast, the incorporation of IFN-R1 as well as IFNbinding proteins (likely IFN-R2) with detergent-resistant membranes remained poor after IFN-addition [50] . A preassociation between IFN-R1 and IFN-R2 (within a population of paraformaldehyde-fixed cells, measured by FRET of the cellular suspension in a cuvette) that increased with ligand treatment, is inhibited by -MCD or by Leishmania infection that quenched cholesterol, but is restored by liposomal delivery of cholesterol to cells [51] . In fact, when cholesterol is quenched from cells, IFN-R1 and IFN-R2 co-sediment with GM 1 in vitro, bind IFN-with similar kinetics as if cholesterol were present, but do not initiate signaling. Surprisingly, cholesterol depletion by Leishmania infection disrupted IFNsignaling but did not inhibit IL-10-induced activation of Stat3. Were our data averaged as if taken throughout a population of cells, we would likely conclude also that the association of IFN-R1 with lipid rafts, as well as of IFN-R1 to IFN-R2, is partial. Because potential sequences were identified that correlated with cholesterol and sphingomyelin binding tohelices [52, 53] , we analyzed the intracellular domains of Class II receptor chains for these consensus sequence, as well as obvious patterns of conserved amino acid residues within the transmembrane receptor chains of Class II cytokine receptor chains. Our analysis of cholesterol-binding and sphingomyelin-binding sites like those found in the IFN-R1 transmembrane segment is described in Supplementary Text 8. Altogether, these data agree with ours in that disruption of lipid rafts (that often occurs with dissolution of membranes) will disrupt ligand-independent interactions between cytokine receptor chains as well as potentially alter the nanolocalization of cytokine receptor chains.",

The two entities have differing apparent affinities between IFN-R2c and IFN-R1, different conformations of IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c, and a different spectroscopic interaction between Jak1 and IFN-R1. The affinity of the lower-affinity entity resembles that seen in the absence of RACK-1 (Supp. Fig. 14) , while the affinity of the higher-affinity entity resembles that seen in the presence of RACK-1. The sixfold difference in affinity between the two entities resembles the fivefold difference seen in the tetrameric complexes. We hypothesize that RACK-1 is the present in both the high-affinity entity and in the highaffinity complex.",

            "text": "We forward the following structural models to explain the conformations that occur as the components of IFN receptor complexes interact in cells. IFN-R1 (red) binds Jak1 (yellowgreen) with high affinity. The IFN-R1:Jak1 complex partitions strongly into subdomains of the plasma membrane (light brown) to which Lyn-ToFP associates (Fig. 6A) , that we predict are lipid rafts (dark brown). Their nano-localization within lipid rafts at low levels allows IFN-R2 (green, in a complex with Jak2, in cyan) to interact (Fig. 6B) . Although our data show that the IFN-R1:IFN-R2 complex remains tightly associated within rafts (Fig. 2C) , we do not know if the tetrameric receptor complex is found on the edge of the raft (left side) or within the raft (right side) because we do not know whether IFN-R2 is within or outside the lipid raft while bound to IFN-R1. Logically, however, the inverse symmetry of the IFN-:IFN-receptor complex (see panel F) places physical hindrances against maintaining nanolocalization of both IFN-R2 chains along raft edges. We therefore hypothesize that IFN-R2 can nanolocalize within lipid rafts even while bound to IFN-R1. We believe that IFN-R1 and IL-10R1 interact with IL-10R2, and that IFN-R2c interacts with IFN-R1, by a similar mechanism and are similarly restricted in the membrane.",

The secondary contact is mediated by elements in the intracellular domain (Fig. 6D) ; based on data presented elsewhere [7] , we believe that Jak1 makes the most important contact, though Jak2, Tyk2 and especially RACK-1 (with IFN-R2c) play roles in the association of the intracellular domains. These roles coincide with spectroscopically observable conformational changes. Contacts among intracellular domains and proteins help maintain preassociation of the complex even while (as hypothesized in the other two companion manuscripts) the extracellular domains frequently dissociate (Fig. 6E) ; we believe that this frequent dissociation allows ligand to interact with the dissociated extracellular domains of the complex and activate it (Fig. 6F ).",

This protocol allows a detailed analysis of energy flow through the donor:intermediate(s):acceptor system. We used this multi-FRET system to show the membrane nanolocalization of two cytokine receptor chains (or their complex), to show the cooperative interaction of three proteins, to show the modification of an interaction by environmental factors, and to show protein rearrangements that occur in the assembly of multi-protein receptor complexes. All of this was done in intact cells, and demonstrates that multi-FRET is a useful technique to use to apply structural biology to live cells, within which pharmacologically sensitive and dynamic protein complexes exist.",

(B) The lipid-raft-associated IFN-R1:Jak1 complex interacts with a complex of IFN-R2 (green) and Jak2 (cyan) to form the tetrameric complex, confined to either the edge (left) or the middle (right) of lipid rafts. Hypothesizing intra-raft localization of the IFN-receptor complex (middle panels) or of the Type I IFN receptor complex (bottom panels), we schematically model their assembly. (C) The interaction of the extracellular domains of IFN-R1 and IFN-R2 or of IFN-R1 (dark green) and IFN-R2c (dark red) is the primary contact that forms the fourchain complex, although it is of low affinity. (D) Interactions between Jak1 and Jak2 occur that help hold together the tetrameric IFN-receptor complex, while interactions among Jak1, Tyk2 (dark blue) and RACK-1 (purple) assist in keeping IFN-R1 and IFN-R2c together. (E) The dissociation of the extracellular domains does not disrupt the complex due to the intracellular interactions. (F) The ligand (brown) binds to the receptor while the extracellular domains are dissociated; the activation of the receptor complex results in tyrosine phosphorylations (black dots) of IFN-R1, IFN-R2c, IFN-R1 and the Janus kinases",
