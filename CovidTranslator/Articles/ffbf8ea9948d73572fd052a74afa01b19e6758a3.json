There is limited understanding of 1 how the time in the future over which individuals make a behavioral decision, their planning 2 horizon, affects epidemic dynamics. We developed an agent-based model (along with an ODE 3 analog) to explore the decision-making of self-interested individuals on adopting prophylactic 4 behavior. The decision-making process incorporates prophylaxis efficacy and disease prevalence 5 with individuals' payoffs and planning horizon. Our results show that for short and long 6 planning horizons individuals do not consider engaging in prophylactic behavior. In contrast, 7 individuals adopt prophylactic behavior when considering intermediate planning horizons. Such 8 adoption, however, is not always monotonically associated with the prevalence of the disease, 9 depending on the perceived protection efficacy and the disease parameters. Adoption of 10 prophylactic behavior reduces the peak size while prolonging the epidemic and potentially 11 generates secondary waves of infection. These effects can be made stronger by increasing the 12 behavioral decision frequency or distorting an individual's perceived risk of infection.",

However, 15 the inclusion of behavior in epidemiological modeling introduces numerous complications and 16 involves fields of research outside the biological sciences, including psychology, philosophy, 17 sociology, and economics. Areas of research that incorporates human behavior into 18 epidemiological models are loosely referred to as social epidemiology, behavioral epidemiology, 19 or economic epidemiology [14, 17] . We use the term 'behavioral epidemiology' to broadly refer 20 to all epidemiological approaches that incorporate human behavior. While the incorporation of 21 behavior faces many challenges [9], one of the goals of behavioral epidemiology is to 22 understand how social and behavioral factors affect the dynamics of infectious disease 23 epidemics. This goal is usually accomplished by coupling models of social behavior and 24 decision making with biological models of contagion [16, 11] .",

Figure 7A shows the proportion of infectious agents above which the prophylactic behavior 328 is more advantageous than non-prophylactic behavior assuming agents know the real disease 329 prevalence (\u03ba = 1). By distorting the perceived disease prevalence to increase the risk 330 perception of being infected (\u03ba = 1.5), the real proportion of infectious agents necessary for 331 agents to engage in prophylactic behavior is reduced as shown in Fig. 7B . Hence, the distortion 332 on disease prevalence makes agents engage in prophylactic behavior even when the chance of 333 being infected is low.

For short planning horizons (i.e. H = 1), agents do 282 not ever consider changing behavior in either disease. This corresponds to the situation in 283 Region A in Fig. 2A in which being prophylactic is never worth the cost, hence the epidemic 284 dynamics are not affected. Similarly, in the cases of H = 30 for Disease 1 and H = 45 for 285 Disease 2, we notice that neither of the two epidemic dynamics change. The dynamics are not 286 affected because the disease prevalence does not reach the switch point (the switch points are 287 indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 5).288 In the cases of H = 45 and 90 for Disease 1 and H = 30 for Disease 2, however, agents 289 change behavior, affects the epidemic dynamics. For Disease 1, the effect is characterized by the 290 decrease on the peak size and a prolonged duration of the epidemic. Although the dynamics of 291 Disease 2 are also affected, the effect is small because a lower portion of the population crosses 292 the switch point.293In other cases, increasing the planning horizon further may cause agents to never 294 contemplate a change in their behavior, for example H = 90 for Disease 2. This means that 295 agents willingly assume the risk of getting infected and then recover, which seems intuitive 296 given the short recovery time and severity of the disease.297 To assess the effect of the frequency that agents make behavioral decisions on the epidemic 298 dynamics, we fix the value of the planning horizon for Disease 1 (H = 90) and Disease 2 on the epidemic dynamics. This figure illustrates how increasing the decision frequency reduces 301 the peak size while prolonging the epidemic, and additionally may generate multiple waves of 302 infection for Disease 1. These multiple waves are generated because increasing the decision 303 frequency means individuals react faster to an increase in prevalence and adopt the prophylactic 304 behavior. This bends the trajectory of disease incidence downward, but the reduction in 305 prevalence causes the pendulum to swing back and individuals return back to their 306 non-prophylactic behavior, thus creating an environment for the resurgence of the epidemic.

This is especially true for harmful diseases with severe 310 consequences to those being infected, such as Ebola or the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 311 (SARS). For example, despite the low level of recorded cases during the 2003 SARS outbreak in 312China (approximately 5,327 cases), people in the city of Guangzhou avoided going outside or 313 wore masks when outside[21,20]. Combined with the severity of the disease, other factors like 314 misinformation or excess media coverage may distort the real perception of disease prevalence 315 (i.e. risk perception), making individuals respond unexpectedly to an epidemic.316Several models incorporate specific mechanisms regulating the diffusion of information 317 about the disease to understand the above factors and how they contribute to the distortion of 318 risk perception[5,10,18]. Here our focus is slightly different. We are interested in 319 understanding the effects that such perception distortion has on the epidemic dynamics. Thus in 320 our model, we have incorporated a distortion factor \u03ba that alters the agents' perception about 321 disease prevalence used in calculating their utilities.
