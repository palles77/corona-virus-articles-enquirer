We suggest that research into further increasing this mutation rate artificially as an antiviral treatment requires a theoretical reevaluation, especially relating to the so-called error threshold. The main evolutionary consequence of a high mutation rate appears to have been to restrict RNA viruses to a small genome; they thus rapidly exploit a limited array of possibilities. Investigating this constraint to their evolution, and how it is occasionally overcome, promises to be fruitful. We explain the many terms used in investigating RNA viral evolution and highlight the specific experimental and comparative work that needs to be done.",

An important consequence, which is now exploited therapeutically, is that RNA viruses might be particularly susceptible to further elevation of their mutation rate; however, we argue that explanations for this involving a so-called error threshold might be misleading. The high mutation rate of RNA viruses affects their importance as human pathogens: it can facilitate rapid escape from adaptive immune responses and from drug treatment.",

The term is also used to describe an accompanying loss of the consensus sequence for the population, which then drifts randomly through sequence space. Error threshold: in the quasispecies model, the point at which fidelity of sequence replication is too low to prevent the error catastrophe (Box 1). Lethal mutagenesis: the reduction in growth rate of a virus achieved by artificially increasing its mutation rate. Mutational robustness: the ability of a genotype to sustain mutations without affecting its phenotype. Quasispecies: a mathematical representation of population growth where the population is divided into categories that are defined by, and linked via, their number of (deleterious) mutations. There is no necessary conflict between these models and those of traditional population genetics: the quasispecies model can be interpreted in terms of mutation-selection balance [46] . Also, the term refers to a chemical rather than a biological definition of a species (i.e. 'almost' a single type or 'species' of molecule). Importantly, and perhaps controversially, mutational linkage leads fitness to being seen as an attribute of the population rather than of an individual virus. Survival of the flattest: under a high mutation rate, the competitive advantage of a genotype with lower replication rate but higher mutational robustness. Corresponding author: Belshaw, R.

Furthermore, retroviruses have a broader range of rates than other RNA viruses (extending down to 0.06 mutations per genome per round of replication [13] ). Perhaps more significantly, higher-fidelity RNA viral polymerases (which lead to a lower mutation rate) can be created in vitro. For example, repeated passage of poliovirus in the presence of the chemical mutagen ribavirin produced a mutant polymerase, differing by only one base, which showed higher replication fidelity than the wild type [14] . A ribavirin-resistant polymerase has also been selected for in FMDV [15] .

Increasing the mutation (error) rate in these models causes unwelcome effects for the viral population. However, we believe that the common use of the term error threshold (or error catastrophe) to explain lethal mutagenesis therapy might be misleading. In Box 1, we show how the error threshold could be an artifact caused by unrealistic model assumptions and how lethal mutagenesis (that is, population extinction) can be explained solely in terms of viral growth and mutation rates.

Here, the wild-type virus must be able to copy itself without error with a probability (Q) at least equal to the difference between its replication and death rates (d/a). Artificially increasing the mutation rate to reduce Q below this value will lead to extinction of the population (lethal mutagenesis). Alternatively, in the absence of d, extinction can be achieved by introducing additional mutant categories with growth rates below one into the model [29] . It is therefore not necessary to invoke an error threshold to explain either the small genomes of RNA viruses (as they get larger, Q will decrease in the absence of greater per base fidelity) or their sensitivity to artificially increased mutation rates (reducing Q directly).

As with lethal mutagenesis and mutational robustness, this expectation was derived from early quasispecies models, which suggested an inverse relationship between sequence length (information content) and mutation rate (the fidelity of copying) [35, 36] . However, this relationship is also intuitive: genomes experiencing a high mutation rate should not be able to exceed a certain size, given that most mutations are harmful [12, 37] . Mutation rate and genome size do in general appear to be inversely related, with the per base mutation rate of a range of DNA microbes varying such that their per genome mutation rate is approximately constant [1] . Consistent with being under such a constraint, RNA viral genomes show signs of compression, with a widespread use of overlapping reading frames (more than one protein being coded for by the same stretch of RNA) [38] .",

We have also found that RNA virus species with larger genomes tend to have relatively larger polymerases, which we speculate might reflect a higher copying fidelity, whereas the equally essential nucleocapid proteins show no such tendency (Figure 2) . We also note that parvoviruses (very small DNA viruses) have rates of substitution similar to those of RNA viruses [40] .

The exceptionally high mutation rates of RNA viruses provide, at least theoretically, the potential for rapid molecular adaptation. This has important consequences, such as in the viral adaptation to adaptive immune defences or our acquisition of new diseases through zoonotic transmission. However, such adaptation is, somewhat paradoxically, highly constrained by the nature of RNA virus genomes, which, owing to their small size, must exhibit high levels of pleiotropy, fitness trade-offs, epistasis and convergent evolution [34] . Thus, rather than being infinitely flexible, it is better to view RNA viruses as restless beasts pacing a small cage -they are capable of rapid adaptive switching among a set of limited phenotypes. The high mutation rate that enables swift viral evolutionary change is the same factor that reduces the complexity of potential viral adaptations, owing to the upper limit that it imposes on viral genome size.",

Genomic robustness is another topic that warrants further theoretical exploration and empirical investigation, especially as this incorporates questions of epistasis and genome complexity that apply to all taxa [41] .

Although almost certainly rare, these viral 'paradigm shifts' are of the greatest importance in viral evolution. Candidate events for such transitions include the acquisition of new accessory genes in large nidoviruses [44] and the recombination event that generated a new alphavirus lineage [45] .
