            "text": "At each of these organelles, decisions are made either to transport or to retain specific molecules. Selective transport and retention underlie the ability of the cell to establish and maintain the individual identities of the separate organelles of this system (Palade, 1975; Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987; Klausner, 1989 Klausner et al., 1992) with the fungal product brefeldin A (BFA). When added to cells, BFA exerts a profound effect on many organelles of the central vacuolar system. A stereotyped structural transformation of the Golgi stacks, TGN, endosomes, and lysosomes is induced and characterized by the production and extension of uncoated tubules (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990 Woods et al., 1991) . While membrane traffic patterns within the peripheral organelles of this system are altered (Hunziker et al., 1991; Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1991; Low et al., 1991) the effects of this drug on traffic and organelle identity have been best studied and characterized for the Golgi apparatus. Perhaps the most striking initial morphological change is the extension of uncoated tubules that emanate from the stacked cisternae of this organelle. These tubules represent structural intermediates that carry the membrane from the Golgi apparatus to the ER. All anterograde traffic beyond the mixed Golgi-ER system is tightly blocked (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989; Doms et al., 1989) .",

The rapid cycling on and off the Golgi membrane of these proteins is controlled by GTP binding and hydrolysis (Orci et al., 1989; Donaldson et al., 1991a) . The addition of BFA prevents their reassociation with the membrane and results in their accumulation in the cytosol.

The recent finding implicating the potential role of trimeric G proteins in the assembly of cytosolic proteins onto the membrane has raised the possibility that the binding of such cytosolic proteins may be a truly regulated process, by analogy to the function of G proteins in signal transduction (Donaldson et al., 1991 b) . As the characterized activity of trimerit G proteins is regulated by membrane receptors, we were intrigued by the possibility that receptors such as ERD-2 may have signaling activity and may actively function to regulate retrograde traffic from the Golgi apparatus to the ER, rather than passively following a constitutive recycling pathway. Such a regulatory role for a membrane protein suggests that it may belong to a family of proteins, by analogy to other signaling receptors. For these reasons, we embarked upon a search for EM-P-related genes as well as studies to determine whether overexpression of such proteins may either mimic or antagonize the dysregulation of Golgi traffic patterns induced by BFA.

Total RNA from the human erythroleukemia cell line, K562, was reverse transcribed to make first-strand DNA that was then used as substrate for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The presence of related sequences within a given amplified band was suggested by restriction digestion and the identification of fragments whose combined sizes added up to a molecular weight greater than the original PCR product (Buck and Axel, 1991) . A fragment of approximately 550 bp, consisting of a mixture of DNA sequences, was the major species generated from oligonucleotides corresponding to sequences within the predicted second and seventh transmembrane domains of ERDQ. We further selected these sequences by amplification with the original 5'primers and another set of degenerate oligonucleotides, directed against a conserved region in the predicted sixth transmembrane domain. The resulting 420 bp amplified fragment was again shown to contain more than one DNA species. This mixture was then subcloned, and 20 individual colonies were screened by sequencing. While one clone gave rise to the identical sequence for the first reported human ERD-2 homolog which we refer to as hERD-2, two others contained an open reading frame that corresponds to a closely related but novel gene product encoding an ERD-2-like protein, ELP-1.",

Both proteins were tagged with the 13 aa, Myc-derived epitope to allow recognition of the expressed proteins (Evan et al., 1985) . In COS cells, approximately 25% of the total population expressed the introduced proteins, as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Interestingly, more than one pattern of cellular distribution of the ELP-1 protein was observed. Approximately 50% of the expressing cell population stained for ELP-1 in a juxtanuclear, Golgi-like pattern, while the remainder showed a reticular, ER-like pattern with nuclear envelope staining ( Figure 2 ). An identical pattern of distributions was observed when a distinct epitope tag derived from influenza hemagglutinin (Field et al., 1988) was utilized. Expression of hERD-2 in COS cells yielded cell populations with the same mixed pattern (Figure 2) . The existence of a second ERDQ-like protein in human cells raises the issue of the function of these two closely related gene products. Whether they function differently, perhaps recognizing distinct ligands, will need to be addressed.",

Our impression was that cells displaying an ER pattern of ELP-1 appeared to express more protein than the cells in which a Golgi distribution was seen. To test this hypothesis, we treated the transfected RD-4 cells with sodium butyrate, which is known to enhance expression of exogenously introduced genes (Gorman et al., 1983). RD4 cells were transfected with ELP-1 and then treated with or without 5 mM butyrate for 24 hr before the cells were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy.

Perhaps as a result of overexpression the newly synthesized ELP-1 was unable to exit the ER owing to aggregation, misfolding, or an as yet undefined mechanism. In many of the cells expressing ELP-1 in an ER pattern, no coexisting Golgi pattern was observed. This suggested that an alternative explanation of the heterogeneous distribution patterns was that overexpression of this protein may have resulted in a collapse of the Golgi apparatus into the ER, as seen in cells treated with BFA. We utilized the lens culinaris lectin as a Golgi marker (Ridgway et al., 1992) because the available Golgi-specific antibodies gave no staining in COS cells. In these cells, the lens culinaris lectin gave a typical Golgi staining pattern, both in untransfected cells and in cells whose ELP-1 distribution was Golgi-like. In cells expressing ELP-1 in an ER pattern, however, no Golgi-like staining by the lectin was seen. Rather, the lectin gave an ER-like staining pattern ( Figure 3 ). Thisstaining could not be attributed to the lectin recognizing ELP-1, because we have previously shown ELP-1 to be unglycosylated.",

The same ER distribution of lectin staining could be produced by treatment of cells with BFA. We sought to confirm this finding in RD-4 cells using the trans-Golgi marker, galactosyltransferase (GalTf). As with the lectin, in cells expressing ELP-1 in an ER pattern the pattern of staining with an antibody directed against GalTf (kindly provided by Dr. Eric Berger) was ER-like, in contrast to the Golgi-like pattern observed in control cells or in cells expressing ELP-1 in a Golgi distribution. Again, the pattern of staining for GalTf in the ELP-l-overexpressing RD-4cells was indistinguishable from that seen after treatment with BFA. Finally, ELP-1 was transiently expressed in NRK cells, which allowed us to follow the fate of the cis-medial Golgi marker, mannosidase II (using an antibody kindly provided by Dr. Kelly Moremen). While only a small percentage (<5%) of these cells displayed an ER pattern, examination of the distribution of mannosidase II also revealed an ER-like pattern and again was indistinguishable from NRK cells treated with BFA (data not shown).",

Staining of such cells with an antibody directed against P-COP revealed a diffuse pattern, again indistinguishable from that seen upon addition of BFA (Figure 4 ).

First, proteins cannot leave the mixed ER-Golgi system, resulting in a tight secretion block. Second, the redistribution of Golgi enzymes into the ER results in Golgi-specific carbohydrate processing of ER-retained glycoproteins (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989) . To examine the possibility that ELP-1 overexpression results in a secretion block, we first transfected COS cells with lysozyme, a marker protein for secretion. Indirect immunofluorescence staining for lysozyme revealed a mixed population of cells with both ER and Golgi patterns. When cycloheximide was added to these singly transfected cells at 20 Kg/ml for 4 hr, virtually all cells were either negative or had a weak Golgi staining for lysozyme, suggesting that lysozyme was being \"chased\" out of transfected cells. We then coexpressed ELP-1 with lysozyme. Double labeling by indirect immuno-fluorescence showed that greater than 90% of transfected cellscoexpressed both proteins in either colocalized ER or Golgi patterns. The subsequent addition of cycloheximide resulted in the persistent staining of cells with lysozyme in an ER distribution only. All of these cells demonstrated a persistent ER staining pattern of ELP-1 ( Figure 5A ). Meanwhile, cells with persistent staining for ELP-1 in a Golgi pattern showed no staining for lysozyme ( Figure 5A ). These results suggested that cells with ELP-1 in an ER pattern blocked secretion of lysozyme, while cells with ELP-1 in a Golgi pattern did not. More exact quantitation of the apparent secretion block was obtained by performing metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments. In cells transfected with lysozyme alone, 85% of the newly synthesized marker protein was recovered in the medium after a 4 hr chase. In contrast, in cells doubly transfected with lysozyme and ELP-1, only 35% of the newly synthesized lysozyme was recovered from the medium ( Figure 5B ). Considering that only about 50% of the doubly transfected cells appeared to overexpress ELP-1 in an ER-like pattern and those were the cells that appeared to retain lysozyme by immunofluorescence, we believe that the level of the secretion block may, in fact, be complete in those cells with apparently disrupted Golgi structures.",

            "text": "The results presented thus far do not allow us to determine whether overexpression of ELP-1 results in its retention in the ER, which in turn leads to the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus, or whether ELP-1 must be able to reach the Golgi in order to alter the structure of that organelle. If the latter were true, we reasoned that the BFA effect might be lessened if ELP-1 could be retained in the ER. In an attempt to address this, we constructed two variants of the ELP-1 protein. In the first construct, we introduced the cytoplasmic tail of the adenovirus El9 protein at the car-boxy1 terminus of ELP-1 (ELP-lIE19). The second variant was identical to the first, but the two lysines at positions -3 and -4 of the El 9 tail were replaced with serines (ELP-1 I El9s). It has previously been shown that these substitutions abolish the ER retention information of this sequence (Jackson et al., 1990) . When ELP-l/E19 was overex-pressed in COS cells, only an ER pattern of the expressed protein was seen ( Figure 7A ). The efficacy of this sequence suggests that the carboxyl terminus of ELP-1 is oriented toward the cytosol. In contrast, the distribution of ELP-l/ElSs was like that of ELP-1, yielding some cells that display a Golgi-like pattern and others with an ER-like pattern ( Figure 7A ). We next compared the fraction of all cells expressing either of these proteins that display a BFA-like distribution of b-COP. In several experiments cells expressing ELP-l/E19 had two to three times fewer cells with a diffuse b-COP distribution than observed in cells expressing either ELP-1 or ELP-iIE19s ( Figure 7A ). We further assessed the relative ability of these two proteins to induce the Golgi-like processing of the carbohydrate side chains of the ER-retained, Tat-El9 construct. As shown in Figure 78 , the coexpression of ELP-l/El9 with Tat-El9 resulted in little additional processing of Tat-El9 than was seen over 24 hr in cells expressing Tat-El9 alone. In contrast, coexpression of ELPIElSs with Tat-El9 resulted in efficient processing of the Tat chimera, consistent with the ability of this ELP-1 chimera to induce a BFA-like phenotype. In these experiments, cells were expressing comparable levels of either ELP-1 chimeric protein, as assessed by immunoprecipitation.",

It is particularly interesting to contrast the effects of ELP-1 overexpression with the effects of ERD-2 deletion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae described by Semenza et al. (1990) . While deletion of this gene is lethal, the authors were able to examine the consequences of down-regulating the cellular expression of the ERD-2 protein. Such cells accumulate intracellular membranes that may be either the Golgi apparatus or Golgi derived and demonstrate a block in normal transport through the secretory pathway at the level of the Golgi apparatus. These results led the authors to propose that, were transfected into COS cells. Ceils were fixed, permeabilized, and double labeled with mouse anti-Myc antibody followed by fluorescein-labeled donkey anti-mouse antibody and rabbit anti-p-COP antibody followed by rhodamine-labeled donkey anti-rabbit antibody. ELP-l/E19 was distributed in an ER pattern in all transfected cells, while the expression of ELP-lIE19s was heterogeneous with the transfected cell population exhibiting a mixed ER and Golgi pattern as previously seen in ELP-1 expression. ELP-l/E19 expression resulted in two to three times fewer cells with P-COP redistributed as compared with cells with ELP-lIEl9s expression.

If one of the functions of molecules such as ERD-2 and ELP-1 is to influence this coat cycle, the phenotypic changes observed could be explained by the overexpression of these proteins perturbing this coat cycle. Although we do observe a redistribution of B-COP in cells overexpressing ELP-1, we have no direct evidence that ELP-1 actually inhibits coatomer binding and whether this inhibition is a proximal effect in the dysregulation of Golgi membrane traffic that is seen in cells overexpressing ELP-1. Thus, despite the resemblance between BFA addition and ELP-1 overexpression, it is difficult to discern whether these two effects arise via analogous mechanisms. This difficulty is partly due to the inability to examine the acute effects of ELP-1 overexpression or the acute reversal of that overexpression, analogous to the addition or removal of BFA.",

These results strongly point to a change in the traffic of the receptor in response to occupancy by a specific ligand. Whether the effects of ELP-1 overexpression reported here require ligand-ELP-1 interaction cannot be determined. It is possible that the phenotypic changes might be explained as the result of reaching a critical level of ligand-independent receptor activation that would mimic the proposed ligand-induced stimulation of retrograde traffic from the Golgi apparatus to the ER. Numerous examples exist in which overexpression of a normal signaling molecule leads to a \"constitutively on\" state (for example, see review by Yarden and Ullrich, 1988) . We believe that the similarity between the phenotypes induced by BFA and ELP-1 overexpression raises the possibility that these two phenomena are mechanistically related. In this regard, it is tempting to speculate on recent data suggesting a role for trimeric G proteins in the regulated binding of BFA-sensitive coat proteins to Golgi membranes (Donaldson et al., 1991b) . Perhaps these seven transmembrane receptors, localized mainly to the Golgi apparatus, will prove to transmit local signals that are mediated by interactions with G proteins.",

            "text": "The regulatory model described above predicts that the effect of ELP-1 overexpression is exerted at the level of the Golgi apparatus rather than at the ER. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of overexpression of ELP-1, whose carboxyl terminus had been modified to contain either a functional or inactive ER retention motif derived from the adenovirus El9 protein (Jackson et al., 1990) . As predicted, the steady-state distribution of ELP-1 I El9 was restricted to the ER in all cells expressing the protein. When compared with the inactive retention variant (which was found in both ER and Golgi distribution patterns), the retained ELP-1 produced a markedly diminished BFA-like phenotype. The ELP-l/E19 protein, however, still had some effect. This may be due to a lowered activity of the ELP-1 exerted at the level of the ER. Alternatively, if this protein is able to leave the ER and be retrieved from a post-ER compartment, its BFA-like effects might still be attributed to its passage through the Golgi. Even if the latter occurs, it is clear that the presence of this cytoplasmic sequence results in a steady-state distribution that is greatly biased toward residency in the ER, and this seems to correlate with its diminished BFA-like effect. If ELP-1 must reach the Golgi complex in order to produce the effects reported here, how might this process occur? A model can be proposed based on the similarity between the effects of ELP-1 overexpression and the addition of BFA to cells. BFA most likely exerts its effects by preventing the GTP-regulated binding of cytosolic coat proteins to the Golgi apparatus and associated structures (Donaldson et al., 1991a) . We can view traffic leading out of the Golgi complex as utilizing either coated vesicles (anterograde traffic) (Rothman and Orci, 1992) or uncoated tubules or tubulovesicular structures (retrograde traffic) (Klausner et al., 1992) . In the presence of BFA, the profound inhibition of coat protein binding inhibits the former pathway and greatly exaggerates the latter. We can imagine then that the presence of liganded ERD-2 or ELP-1 in the Golgi might result in a local inhibition of coat protein binding. In the absence of coat, a BFA-like uncoated bud would emerge, carrying the receptor-ligand complex back to the ER (Figure 9 ). Thus, according to such a model, the level of retrograde traffic, mediated by uncoated buds, would be determined by the level of ER lumenal protein leakage into the Golgi complex.",

In this last instance, a temperature-sensitive mutant of CHO cells, selected by virtue of a conditional secretion block, has been reported to mimic at least some of the effects of BFA on the Golgi apparatus at nonpermissive temperatures (Zuber et al., 1991) . Although we must directly address the mechanistic relations underlying these phenomena, we are beginning to gather multiple pieces of evidence that the Golgi apparatus exists as a steady-state structure, maintained at a fine and highly regulated balance. Such a view has implications far beyond this organelle and raises the question of how cellular control over the structure and dynamics of its various organelles is maintained. As useful as the drug BFA may ultimately prove to be in studying membrane traffic, we can, in addition, observe dramatic changes in organelle structure and membrane traffic by altering the level of expression of endogenous proteins. The identification and perturbation of such proteins, with a detailed description of the resulting phenotypic changes, will set the stage for asking more mechanistic questions regarding the biochemical basis of membrane traffic and organelle dynamics.
