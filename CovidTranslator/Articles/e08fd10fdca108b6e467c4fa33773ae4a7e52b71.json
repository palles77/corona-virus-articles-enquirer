Towards the end of the year 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2)(1-3) infection occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It rapidly spread to every corner of China and many other places around the world. SARS-CoV-2 is a new member of the coronavirus family, which is different to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, SARS-CoV.(4) Current reports show that SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than SARS-CoV. The new coronavirus pneumonia has been named as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization. (5) On February 20, 2020, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases had reached as high as 75,993 in China. Among these cases, 2239 died, and most of the deaths occurred in elderly patients with certain underlying illnesses. (6) (7) (8) To confront this terrible epidemic, China took restrictive measures to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Restricting the population movement, shutting down of schools and factories, building up new shelter hospitals, and many other measures were carried out. In addition to ordinary measures, the lockdown of Wuhan since January 23, 2020, a city with more than 10 million people, was a unique and unusual method. At the same time, many provinces and cities in China initiated a level I public health event response. To further control the epidemic, from February 5th, 2020, all confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients and close contacts in Wuhan were asked to quarantine at assembly sites instead of home quarantine. What is the effect of these countermeasures for controlling this epidemic?",

Michael Levitt, a professor of Stanford University, speculated that since January 25, 2020, the national death toll and the death toll in Hubei province showed a monotonous declining trend. The external linear correlation suggests that the number of new deaths in the coming week will decline rapidly, leading to the conclusion that the epidemic would terminate soon. (9) However, there are many other different opinions. The University of Lancaster, the University of Florida, and the Centre for Viral Research at the University of Glasgow carried out modeling analysis based on the data before January 21, 2020. They estimated that the number of infected individuals may be as high as 14464 cases on January 22, 2020 in Wuhan. If there were no effective measures, the total number of infection cases would reach as high as 105077 on January 29, 2020.(10) A team of researchers from Xi'an Jiaotong University in China and York University in Canada worked together to build a more realistic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, and the novel coronavirus infection could reach an inflection point on March 10, 2020.(11) Big gaps existed between different predictions. Which one is identical with the actual situation? In addition, being the eye of the storm, Wuhan city and Hubei Province show a different situation compared to that in the other provinces in China. Therefore, we compared the data of different places to predict the trend of this epidemic in China.",

Many other provinces responded to the public health incidents by adopting quarantine measures and community-level monitoring to control the epidemic spread. Figure 2 shows the changes in the cumulative number of confirmed cases and the daily number of new confirmed cases since the lockdown of Wuhan, Hubei province, on January 23, 2020. Figure 2A shows that the cumulative number of confirmed cases kept increasing. Most of the cases were found in Hubei Province. Total number of confirmed cases outside Hubei province in China was 12,905 on February 20, 2020. Total number of confirmed cases in Hubei province was 38,839 on February 15, 2020. Figure 2B shows the daily change in the number of new confirmed cases since January 23, 2020. The daily number of new confirmed cases in most provinces of China showed a downward trend, including Hubei Province.
