However, comparatively few wildlife epidemiological studies use quantitative PCR (qPCR) for pathogen detection, even fewer employ an internal control, to ensure confidence in negative results, and PCR's ability to multiplex and therefore detect several targets in a single reaction is underutilised. Here, we describe the development of two multiplex qPCR assays for the red and grey squirrel that detect the pathogens squirrelpox virus (SQPV) and adenovirus in squirrels (SADV), both of which cause mortality in the red squirrel. Both assays use a section of the squirrel phosphoglycerate kinase gene as an endogenous internal control that identifies and compensates for both, inadequate sampling or PCR inhibition. Tests on infected squirrel tissue demonstrate that simple swab samples (particularly from distal antebrachial skin) are sufficient to detect and identify the relative quantity of SQPV DNA in both squirrel species, while rectal swabs and blood cell pellets can be used to reliably indicate SADV infection. These assays are sensitive and specific with an endogenous internal control providing confidence in negative results and allowing comparison across laboratories. Using such assays should prove advantageous in wildlife studies with limited resources while allowing the maximum data yield.",

Wildlife disease surveillance thus forms an essential part of the 'One Health' theme (Thompson 2013) , with studies providing an opportunity to both benefit human health and the wildlife species in question (Jenkins et al. 2015) . To minimise transmission of pathogens between wildlife and livestock or humans, it is necessary to understand the species' ecology and pathogen transmission pathways (Boadella et al. 2011; Delahay et al. 2009 ). Any investigation of host-pathogen dynamics relies on a sensitive and specific detection assay (Boadella et al. 2011) , and yet application of current molecular techniques to wildlife disease epidemiology has been slow in comparison with studies of humans and livestock (Benton et al. 2015) .",

            "text": "Contemporary diagnostic tests for many pathogens rely on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as assays often yield excellent sensitivity and specificity (for both fresh and archived samples) and in less time than many traditional assays (Cai Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10344-016-1031-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. et al. 2014) . In particular, quantitative PCR (qPCR) combines high-throughput sample processing with increased sensitivity and reduced potential for contamination (Klein 2002) . However, PCR can be prone to inhibition in all formats (Brankatschk et al. 2012; Schrader et al. 2012 ) and quality control is therefore vital during assay development and processing (Borst et al. 2004; Burkardt 2000; Lo and Chan 2006) . One key quality control measure is to include an internal control (IC) to minimise occurrence of false-negative results. ICs that consist of a known DNA sequence, added to the sample prior to or post-DNA purification (exogenous IC), are often convenient (e.g. in commercial kits) but may impair assay sensitivity (Cai et al. 2014 ). Alternatively, a region of the host's genomic DNA (reference gene) can be used as an IC (endogenous IC) to verify the absence of PCR inhibitors during sample processing; using an endogenous control prevents the need to add foreign DNA to the qPCR and allows calculation of relative quantity of target DNA. Internal endogenous controls are frequently used in gene expression studies but rarely used in pathogen detection assays. Multiplex PCRs can be used to detect simultaneously the target and endogenous IC sequences and thus save time and costs (Cai et al. 2014; Elnifro et al. 2000) .",

A combination of modelling (Rushton et al. 2006; Tompkins et al. 2003) , experimental infection studies (Tompkins et al. 2002) and field data (Chantrey et al. 2014) indicates that a major part of the decline of UK red squirrel populations is due to infection by squirrelpox virus (SQPV). This pathogen is thought to have been introduced with the grey squirrel, a theory supported by a high prevalence of exposure despite an absence of clinical disease (Bruemmer et al. 2010; Sainsbury et al. 2000) , an association between seropositive grey squirrels and the appearance of clinical cases of squirrelpox in red squirrels (McInnes et al. , 2013 Sainsbury et al. 2008) and an association of the pathogen in both squirrel species during an outbreak of disease in red squirrels (Chantrey et al. 2014 ). Programmes to reintroduce red squirrels in the UK have been hampered by disease: by SQPV in Norfolk (Carroll et al. 2009 ) and adenovirus in squirrels (SADV) in other areas of the UK (Everest et al. 2008 (Everest et al. , 2012b Martinez-Jimenez et al. 2011 ). SADV appears to cause mortality in wild red squirrels (Duff et al. 2007; Everest et al. 2012a ), although the impact on a population scale is largely unknown with subclinical infections also reported (Everest et al. 2014) .",

As grey squirrels appear asymptomatic, lower infection loads are recorded, and thus it is essential to use the more sensitive qPCR assays when screening for SQPV presence as part of a wildlife disease management programme for red squirrels. For SADV infection, confirmation has relied on either TEM (Everest et al. 2008) or conventional qualitative PCR assays (Everest et al. 2009b) . No assay for either pathogen has incorporated an IC (either exogenous or endogenous). Additionally, the use of ICs to monitor squirrel pathogens is essential because staphylococcal exudative dermatitis (Simpson et al. 2010 (Simpson et al. , 2013a and rotaviral enteritis (Everest et al. 2009a) show similar lesions to SQPV and SADV, respectively. This presents a clear opportunity for misdiagnosis (in the absence of other diagnostic tests) if the pathogen assay reports a false negative, for example due to unrecognised presence of PCR inhibitors.",

A mixture of previously identified positive samples was used to create a DNA template that was positive for the IC and both of the target genes. Multiplex qPCRs were run as 20 \u03bcl final reaction volumes that contained 4 \u03bcl 5 \u00d7 QuantiTect\u00ae virus Master Mix (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), appropriate amounts of each primer and probe (Table 1 ) and ca. 50 ng template DNA. Thermal cycling conditions were 5 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 50 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 75 s at 60 C. PCR efficiencies of reliable multiplex qPCRs were assessed using serial dilution of standards (10 7 -10 2 copies and 5 7 -5 2 copies) with five reactions per dilution. As neither virus is readily isolated in cell culture, we modified the qPCR protocol of O'Callaghan and Fenech (2011) to quantify the amount of target DNA. Briefly, known quantities of synthetic oligonucleotides (Eurofins MWG Operon, Edersberg, Germany, or Integrated DNA Technologies, Leuven, Belgium) (see Online Resource S2) for calculations to determine number of copies based on molecular weight of the oligonucleotides), whose single-stranded DNA sequences are those of the control and target genes that binds the probe, are used to create a standard curve against which the amount of target DNA in the unknown samples can be calculated (O'Callaghan and Fenech 2011). With no gold standard assay for either target and therefore no confidence about a 'truly negative' sample, Lambda (\u03bb) DNA (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) was added to the serial dilutions to ensure the same quantity of DNA overall in each qPCR (Online Resource S3). Only multiplex qPCRs with efficiencies between 90 and 110 % for all assays were retained.",

Some squirrels were suspected to have SQPVor SADV based on gross lesions (skin ulcers or enteritis, respectively), while three red squirrels had no sign of disease (i.e. road casualties) and three red squirrels were selected on the basis that they had gross lesions not traditionally associated with either SQPV or SADV (skin or gastrointestinal inflammation, respectively). As grey squirrels rarely show clinical signs for either infection, 16 carcases were selected at random from samples submitted as part of a grey squirrel control programme (during autumn 2011). All squirrels had a systematic necropsy examination. Swabs (Dacron tip, Fisher Scientific UK Ltd., Loughborough, UK) were taken from sites believed to have a predilection for SQPV infection (i.e. oral/lip, eyelid and/or arm vibrissae) (Atkin et al. 2010) or SADV enteric infection (rectum). Corresponding skin samples were taken, along with flank and chest (vibrissae) skin samples for grey squirrels and nose, ear, digit, inguinal and genital skin samples for red squirrels. Submandibular lymph node, lung, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, stomach, small intestine (duodenum and jejunum), large intestine (caecum and colon), faeces, skeletal muscle and brain were all sampled. Blood was collected postmortem and serum was separated from the cell pellet by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 10 min). All samples were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until DNA purification using a DNeasy\u00ae blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) and the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was extracted from swabs using protocol (a) in the Online Resource S5. DNA was isolated from the blood cell pellet using a FlexiGene DNA kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) following the protocol (b) in the Online Resource S5. A 'no sample' DNA extraction was completed in tandem with every batch of extractions to monitor potential contamination during DNA extractions.",

All undesirable secondary structures had a delta G (\u0394G) >\u22122 and melting temperature (T m ) at least 30\u00b0C less than the chosen T a . These suggested inhibitory secondary structures at the reaction temperature were highly unlikely to form and thus have little detrimental effect on the desired PCR reaction. PCR product sequences were confirmed to be the same as predicted target sequences (Online Resource S7, Fig. S7.2-7.7) . Brief comparisons between SYBR\u00ae green and hydrolysis probe methods demonstrated that both chemistries yielded comparable values of C p . Moreover, completing the assays as either duplexes or triplexes had little impact on C p values. (A summary of these results is provided in the Online Resource S8, Fig. S8 .1). Optimal primer/probe concentrations varied between 200 and 400 nm for uniplex reactions (Table 1) . While satisfactory efficiencies (i.e. E >90 % but <110 %) with duplex reactions were achieved using the same primer/probe concentrations as for uniplex reactions (see Online Resource S8, Fig. S8 .2-3 for standard curves), triplex reactions required primers and probes to be of equal concentration (200 nM; as per the manufacturer's recommendation) to achieve reaction efficiencies comparable to those recorded in duplex reactions (Fig. 1) . All assays had maximised amplification over a 5-10\u00b0C range in T a , with a T a of 60\u00b0C acceptable for all assays (Table 1) .

A clear benefit is that, since much of the optimisation and validation is carried out in multiplex, there is relatively little additional work required to develop assays that screen for more than one pathogen; moreover, multiplex reactions increase the amount of data gained from a single sample, and incorporating an endogenous IC into the design provides confidence in the reliability of the (negative) results and allows comparison of results across laboratories. Therefore, any disadvantage of additional initial investment into assay development is quickly outweighed by the greater quantity and quality of data produced. Overall, the new assays identified similar findings to the previously published methods. Our SQPV assays and the Atkin et al. (2010) SYBR\u00ae green assay both identified SQPVas a localised infection in grey squirrels, compared with the generalised, systemic infection in red squirrels. The agreement between available TEM data and our qPCR assays for SADV was moderate (k value = 0.39), but this level of agreement is nonetheless superior to that reported in studies using conventional PCR. Grey squirrel SADV results are reasonably comparable to previous studies reporting infection prevalence of spleen and blood samples as 54-57 and 0-7 % (Everest et al. 2014 ) in comparison to 33 and 50 % reported here. The difference in prevalence of SADV in blood samples may reflect the increased sensitivity of the qPCR assay developed, with the level of SADV in blood generally low, and thus potentially overlooked when screening with conventional PCR. However, differences in selection, geography and time of year may also have been responsible for or contributed to the data obtained. In red squirrels, SADV is believed to be an enteric infection although systemic effects are witnessed, with splenitis commonly reported (Martinez-Jimenez et al. 2011; Sainsbury et al. 2001) . This is supported by our data, with the gastrointestinal tract, liver, blood and spleen showing the highest intensities and prevalence of SADV infection.",

In fact, the latter factor proved important in 7 out of 24 faecal samples analysed when screening samples, when, despite apparently adequate amounts of DNA, no amplification for the PGK assay (or either pathogen assay) was recorded.

The use of an endogenous IC has allowed the validation of the use of swabs to detect the target pathogens. The level of a pathogen on a swab not only depends on the pathogen abundance at the site sampled but also on the amount of sample effort. However, it is reasonable to assume that this latter factor will also dictate the amount of reference DNA harvested. Hence, the use of an endogenous IC compensates for any variability in sample effort-a potential confounding factor when using swabs to collect samples. However, caution is required when comparing swabbed material with tissue samples. Relative quantification is the ratio of the target viral DNA (SQPV/SADV) to the reference squirrel DNA (PGK). Thus, if the sampling method harvests host cells poorly in comparison to viral particles, then an artificially high viral load may be indicated. This may, in part, explain why arm swabs yielded by far the highest RQ of SQPV in grey squirrels (Fig. 2) . Unsurprisingly, arm swabs show a poorer harvest of squirrel DNA in comparison to other sample types (Online Resource S10, Fig. S10.1 ). Yet, in terms of absolute quantities, arm swabs show a proportionally higher number of DNA copies of the SQPV target gene (Online Resource S10, Fig. S10.1) . Therefore, the high levels of SQPV in arm swabs appear genuine, a conclusion supported by the infection levels in skin sampled from the same site in red squirrels (see Figs. 2 and 3) .",

While previous attempts to use swabs to diagnose a SQPV infection in grey squirrels failed to identify infected individuals (Collins et al. 2014) , swab samples provided several benefits in this study. Swabs allow multiple sites and a greater sampling area to be surveyed without concern for overloading the sample with host DNA. Thus, a single swab sampling the oral, eye and distal arm areas investigated would identify all infected individuals in this study and is recommended as the sampling method of choice in both squirrel species for SQPV detection alone (Table 2) . Adding a rectal swab (potentially combined with the cutaneous swab) and blood would make one confident in detecting the majority of SADV cases while also performing analysis for SQPV. It should be noted, however, that reliability of using swabs depends upon the use of the endogenous IC that indicates adequate harvesting of cells (via amplification of squirrel DNA).",

Similarly, gastrointestinal lesions have been reported in a single SQPVinfected red squirrel in Northern Ireland (Collins et al. 2014 ). Other SQPV-infected red squirrels in this study yielded SQPV in the gastrointestinal tract, with an increase in RQ passing through the gastrointestinal tract potentially indicating replication within the intestine.

The cause of death of these two squirrels was thought to be due to anaemia, It should be noted that the swab/blood samples appear to be superior to tissue samples in all instances apart from adenovirus in red squirrels when using the qPCR developed in this study secondary to parasitism (Duff et al. 2010; Larose et al. 2010; Simpson et al. 2013b ).

Additionally, the red squirrel that had pneumonia also showed SADV DNA presence in all tissues analysed. The lung RQ value was the highest recorded in any infected individual (12.52), and, indeed, viral prevalence in lung tissue was relatively common in infected individuals (64 %, 7/11; 95 % CI, 32-88 %) (Fig. 3) .",
