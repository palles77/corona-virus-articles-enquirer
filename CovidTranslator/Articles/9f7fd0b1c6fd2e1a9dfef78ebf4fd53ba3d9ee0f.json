            "text": "The enhanced sensitivity of nested PCR is achieved by carefully controlling the reaction conditions for the first and second amplification processes to favor the generation of the desired product. In addition to the usual considerations, most nested PCR procedures require a several fold excess of inner over outer primers in the second amplification process for satisfactory results. Conventional nested PCR procedures generally accomplish this by amplifying only a small aliquot of the completed first amplification mixture after being transferred to a new reaction tube for the second amplification process. Unfortunately, the high sensitivity provided by conventional nested PCR procedures is achieved at the price of potential false positives as the reaction tubes containing high concentrations of the first amplicons have to be opened and manipulated to set up the second amplification, thereby introducing the chance of contamination, and this is a significant cause of false-positive results and diminishing the reliability of the results. Implementing of both amplification reactions in the nested-PCR in a 'single-tube' nested-PCR to reduce the risk of contamination has been reported (Llop et al. 2000 , Mathis et al. 1997 , Olmos et al. 1997 , Wolff et al. 1995 , Abath et al. 2002 . One approach is to use differential annealing temperatures to sequentially select amplification primed first by outer (high melting temperature primer pairs), followed by inner (low melting temperature) primer pairs. Another approach is to allow the physical separation of the primers and additional reagents required for the second reaction from those of the first reaction in one tube initially and then allow them to be mixed when required without opening the tube. For example, nested reaction reagents have been suspended in a modified pipette tips before being placed in the reaction tube, or dried in a trehalose matrix. Additionally, the immobilized inner primers have also been employed to achieve the single-tube nested PCR. However, these procedures have their disadvantages. Annealing temperature-differentiated nested reactions may produce nonspecific amplification products from the activity of the outer primers during the nested amplification cycles. Physical devices used to separate the nested reaction reagents can be awkward and complicated to use, and although overcoming contamination of the second nested reaction, increase the risk of contamination from other sources while preparing and dispensing the reactions. We have developed a much simpler and cost effective method based on the use of a piece of plastic film that allows reverse transcription and nested-PCR in a single closed-tube and the procedure is shown in Figure 1 .",
