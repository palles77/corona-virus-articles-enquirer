Delia found that surge capacity varied substantially, depending on how the beds were counted. The absence of a standard way of calculating surge capacity should not be too surprising, because the term itself is a relatively recent entry into the medical lexicon. A PubMed search reveals that it first appeared in 2000 in a military medicine publication 2 and then became more common after the September 11 attacks in 2001 3 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks of 2003. 4 So what is surge capacity?",

But when calculated with beds that hospitals actually maintained (ie, those set up and staffed on any given day) as the denominator, occupancy ranged from 73%, according to annual figures, to 84%, according to average daily figures, with 58% of days above the threshold occupancy rate of 85%.",

            "text": "So should we look to licensed beds or maintained beds when evaluating surge capacity? We should probably focus on average daily maintained beds because the health effects of disasters tend to be felt most acutely in days to weeks and are not averaged over a year and because a real patient needs an actual staffed bed, not just a licensed one. Surge capacity calculated according to average daily maintained beds may give cause for concern since more than half the time hospital occupancy was higher than 85% (a rate associated with delayed inpatient bed availability); about a quarter of the time, the occupancy rate was higher than 90% (a rate associated with bed crises); and about three quarters of the time, bed availability decreased below the federal standard of 500 unoccupied beds available per million residents in the event of a mass casualty incident. 1, 6 Yet these results raise a question: if you can't always get what you want (occupancy rates meeting the regulatory standard), can you still get what you need (sufficient surge capacity to respond effectively to a catastrophe)? To answer this, consider the elements that constitute surge capacity in a disaster. The capacity of a hospital to meet a surge in demand is not only about its bed count but also about the personnel, treatment spaces, operating rooms, sophisticated equipment, and supplies that are needed before and after the patient gets into a bed. Most of these elements cannot be stockpiled and hauled out of storage when needed. Therefore, a simple count of available beds, however calculated, may give a false sense of alarm (or security) about the true surge capacity within a health care system.",

On the other hand, hospital capacity may be reduced by unpredictable events such as the loss of hospital facilities in the disaster itself (such as occurred in the flooded hospitals of New Orleans) 7 or the loss of hospital personnel because of illness (which will inevitably occur in an influenza pandemic). 8 Therefore, many uncontrollable or difficult-to-predict elements may have substantial effects on a hospital's true surge capacity, irrespective of the number of unoccupied beds on any given day.",

The short answer is yes, but it may not be the most important element of a comprehensive surge capacity plan. The focus should be on the development of policies, protocols, and procedures to rapidly reduce routine hospital activities in a safe, sensible, and ethical manner so that the staff and resources freed can be used to respond to the calamity. These plans must be developed ahead of time and should identify which nonurgent surgeries and procedures can be readily cancelled and which inpatients can be most readily transferred to other sites (eg, chronic care facilities) to increase hospital capacity. Lists of qualified medical personnel no longer working clinically but who could be requested to return to clinical work if necessary should be created and maintained current. The response of the general public in disasters can be difficult to predict; hence, public education campaigns could be designed in advance and implemented when necessary to advise people when to seek hospital-based care (eg, discourage attendance for minor complaints but encourage use for higher-risk patients).",
