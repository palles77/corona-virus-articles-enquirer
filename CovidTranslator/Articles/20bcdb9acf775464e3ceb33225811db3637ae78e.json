This study was conducted to investigate if there was a seasonal variation in the incidence of hMPV infection in young children and possible associations between hMPV infection and local meteorological parameters in Suzhou, China. A total of 6,655 children with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) the presence of hMPV using reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction. The relationship between the presence of the virus and regional meteorological conditions was analyzed by linear and multivariate regression analysis. The overall hMPV infection incidence over the four-year study was 8.2 %, 8.1 %, 12.7 % and 7.4 % per year, respectively. Four hundred eighty-eight hMPV-positive children (78.2 %) were younger than 3 years of age. hMPV infections appear to have a seasonal distribution in Suzhou. In 2006, the peak seasons were in December to January, while in 2008, the peak of hMPV activity occurred in May. The incidence of hMPV infection was negatively correlated with the average monthly temperature and rainfall. hMPV was one of the most common viral pathogens after respiratory syncytial virus that was associated with acute respiratory tract infection in children in Suzhou. hMPV infection occurred throughout the year with peaks during late winter and early spring. Climatic factors, especially monthly average temperature, may affect the prevalence of hMPV in Suzhou.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially for infants and young children [1] . A variety of viruses, including influenza viruses (Inf), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (ADV), rhinovirus, and coronavirus have all been associated with ARTI in children. In 2001, a novel respiratory virus called human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was first identified in the Netherlands and later in other European countries, North America and Asia [2] [3] [4] [5] . hMPV is a negative singlestranded RNA virus and a major cause of upper (URI) and lower respiratory illness (LRI) in all age groups including children, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly. Children under 3 years of age are particularly susceptible to infections caused by hMPV [6] [7] [8] . Global hMPV activity varies substantially from year to year among different populations and regions, with the majority of hMPV infections occurring in either winter or spring [9] . A study conducted in the Netherlands demonstrated that the peak of an hMPV epidemic occurred in February, with the season beginning in November and ending in May [10] . Falsey and colleagues found that the incidence of hMPV infection in New York was highest from December to March [11] . In contrast, hMPV infection in Hong Kong, a subtropical region, is quite high during spring and early summer [12] . Another study performed in Italy showed that the epidemic peak occurred in February during one season, and in March during a second [13] .",

            "text": "Most studies have shown that the incidence of infection with hMPV is highest among young infants under 2 years of age [24] [25] [26] . In our study, the incidence of infection with hMPV among children reached the highest level in infants less than 3 years of age and accounted for 78.2 % of the total cases. Moreover, the incidence peaked at the age of 12-36 months. Our study was therefore consistent with other studies that indicated that young infants are more susceptible to hMPV [24, 25, 27] . A less well developed and efficient immune response, the small size of the conducting airways and the incomplete development of the lung structure may explain why infants have a higher incidence of hMPV infection [28] . Several studies have shown a strong association between HMPV infection and wheezing illness [4, 29, 30] . Conversely, Rawlinson et al. took the opposite view, suggesting that asthma attacks in children are related to human rhinovirus rather than to hMPV [31] . In the present study, 47.9 % of cases of hMPV infection were accompanied by wheezing, and the majority of wheezing patients were infants, indicating that hMPV infection may play a part in childhood asthma or, more likely, that wheezing may be the early manifestation of an asthma attack. A number of previous studies have reported that respiratory syncytial virus is a principal cause of co-infection with hMPV, presumably because the seasonal distribution of hMPV and RSV appears to overlap [32] . Reported prevalences of co-infections with other respiratory viruses vary from 5 % to 30 % [33] [34] [35] . In this study, the hMPV/ RSV co-infection rate was at a lower level (3.9 %), which is inconsistent with these previous studies. In this four-year consecutive study, we found that hMPV infections occur throughout the year but that seasonal hMPV activity varied substantially from year to year. The overall hMPV infection incidence of the four years among hospitalized children with ARTI was 8.2 %, 8.1 %, 12.7 % and 7.4 % respectively, and the incidence rates of hMPV infection were statistically significant across the four-year period (v 2 = 74.67, p \\ 0.001). This result is consistent with a previous study in Italy in which the incidence of hMPV infection also varied over a three-year study period, with the rates of positivity for hMPV recorded at 7 % in 2001 but 37 % and 43 % in 2000 and 2002, respectively [13] . Moreover, Falsey also reported that the hMPV infection rate was 1.5 % in 2000 in the USA, significantly lower than the rate of 7 % in 2001 [36] . It has been described in earlier studies that hMPV infections seem to have a seasonal distribution. In Hong Kong, hMPV outbreaks occurred during the spring/summer seasons in 2001-2002 [12] . In contrast, D\u00f8llner and colleagues reported that the hMPV infection rate of children who were hospitalized in Norway was 21 % during the 2002 to 2003 winter season, with a rate of 57 % during November-December alone; this is the highest rate ever reported [37] . Other reports suggest that hMPV may also be circulating throughout the year [38] . Data from the present study show that hMPV infections seem to have a seasonal distribution in Suzhou. In 2006, 2007 and 2009, the peak seasons were in December-January, indicating that hMPV was prevalent in winter. However, in 2008, the peak of hMPV activity occurred in May, indicating that hMPV was prevalent in spring. Epidemiological observations in Austria, Croatia and Switzerland have suggested that hMPV activity appears to follow a cycle of variation similar to previous findings with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [19, 39, 40] . Aberle et al. reported that hMPV activity was characterized by a biennial pattern of alternating winter and spring activity, with spring activity occurring every second year over a 7-year study period in the temperate climatic zone of Austria [19] . We speculate that hMPV activity also followed a pattern of biannual variation in Suzhou, similar to that observed by Aberle et al [19] . However, surveillance over more years is required in order to provide further evidence that hMPV follows a biannual variation pattern in our region.",

Interestingly, hMPV infection during April and May 2008 was more prevalent (29.9 % and 31.6 %) compared to the same period of the other 3 years, indicating that monthly total rainfall may play an important role and affect transmission of hMPV among children. This is despite detection of low correlations between hMPV positive rates and total monthly rainfall. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a correlation between hMPV annual epidemics and meteorological factors. hMPV activity showed a negative correlation with the monthly average temperature, but no correlation with total rainfall, monthly mean relative humidity or total bright sunshine duration. The monthly average temperature was the factor most closely correlated with the number of cases of hMPV in Suzhou, suggesting that low temperature plays a more important role than average rainfall during these seasons. A limited amount of literature is available on hMPV transmission and the role of temperature [41] . However, more-thorough investigations on transmission and temperature associations have been undertaken for influenza, a typical winter disease; Yusuf et al. [42] found that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) transmission is temperature dependent and provided direct experimental evidence to support the role of weather conditions in the dynamics of RSV transmission. They found increased viral shedding and enhanced transmission at 5\u00b0C compared with 20\u00b0C. This may be a result of the increased stability of the virus in secretions in the colder environment [43] .",

Firstly, surveillance was only performed in patients with infections severe enough to be hospitalized, and so prospective surveillance is required to monitor the epidemiology of hMPV infections in the community as a whole. Secondly, year-long active surveillance studies in consecutive years and in different geographic regions are required in order to better define the correlation between annual epidemics of hMPV and meteorological factors.",

Children aged less than 3 years were more susceptible to hMPV. Our data strongly suggest that the monthly average temperature is an important predictor of hMPV activity in this region of China, and this should be investigated further.",
