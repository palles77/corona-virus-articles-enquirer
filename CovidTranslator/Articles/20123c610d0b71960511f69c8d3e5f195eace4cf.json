Furthermore, veterinarians should develop formal infection control plans, identify common case scenarios (e.g., diarrhea, respiratory disease) in which antimicrobial drugs are often employed, develop antimicrobial use protocols for their practice, and categorize all antibiotics in primary, secondary, and tertiary use categories, besides appropriate diagnostic and sensitivity measures. Monitoring and surveillance for trends in the prevalence of resistant bacteria within a practice, a farm, a region, or a nation permits continual evaluation of antimicrobial drug use on various levels.",

            "text": "Antimicrobial agents have been used for treating calves with diarrhea for more than 50 years. Diarrhea in preweaned calves is by far the leading cause of mortality in dairy heifer calves with no change in mortality rates between 1995 and 2001 in the United States. 2 Despite the widespread availability of vaccines against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, rotavirus, and coronavirus, as well as continued emphasis on optimizing colostral transfer of passive immunity, the oral and parenteral administration of antimicrobial agents continues to play an important role in the treatment of calf diarrhea. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Evidence-based recommendations for the administration of antimicrobial agents in diarrheic calves were recently developed based on a systematic review of randomized controlled studies published in peer-reviewed journals. 8, 9 This chapter is based on those recommendations and the results of recent studies on the use of antimicrobials in calves with diarrhea during the first few weeks in life (preweaning period). For a complete historic background and reference list of antimicrobial use in the treatment of calf diarrhea, the reader is referred to these reviews. 8, 9 ETIOLOGY OF CALF DIARRHEA Neonatal calf diarrhea is usually due to infection by at least one enteropathogen (enterotoxigenic E. coli, rotavirus, coronavirus, cryptosporidia, Salmonella spp.). In many herds several agents are usually present and can be detected in neonatal calves with and without diarrhea. If calf diarrhea occurs in an outbreak situation with high morbidity, Salmonella bacteria may be involved. Regardless of the etiology, calves with diarrhea often have increased coliform bacterial numbers in the small intestine and this colonization is associated with altered small intestinal function, morphologic damage, and increased susceptibility to bacteremia. 9 The importance of bacterial overgrowth in calf diarrhea recently gained attention when the role of D-lactic acid in the development of acidemia in calves with diarrhea was identified. Production of D-lactic acid results from bacterial fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract and is a common finding in neonatal calves with and without diarrhea. 10-12 D-lactic acid is a major component of acidemia in diarrheic calves [13] [14] [15] and is accompanied by systemic signs of weakness and ataxia. 16 ",

[17] [18] [19] The frequency of bacteremia is considered sufficiently high that treatment of calves with diarrhea that are severely ill (as manifest by reduced suckle reflex, >6% dehydration, weakness, inability to stand, or clinical depression) should include routine treatment against bacteremia, with emphasis on treating potential E. coli bacteremia. A clinical sepsis score to predict bacteremia is not recommended to guide antibiotic treatment decisions until further validation of the score in different calfrearing scenarios. 20 Bacteremia should be suspected to be present in all calves with clinical signs of Salmonella diarrhea, although the prevalence of bacteremia in affected calves has not been determined. 21",

CONSTABLE Antibiotic Treatment of Diarrhea in Preweaned Calves testing by standardized methods has been widely recommended to allow an evidence-based approach for drug selection and justify antibiotic use. 1 Laboratory methods and standardized breakpoints need to be established for several bacteria-drug combinations. 1 Several fecal isolates-E. coli, Clostridium perfringens type A, and Campylobacter spp.-are normal intestinal flora. Therefore diagnostic laboratories should clearly indicate normal bacterial growth in fecal culture samples, if the cultured bacteria cannot be distinguished from normal flora by identification of species, specific virulence factors or correlated markers, or clear demonstration of overgrowth. 1 When enterotoxigenic E. coli or Salmonella is isolated, susceptibility testing may provide a useful guide for treatment decisions and antimicrobial drug selection.",

            "text": "The most important determinant of antimicrobial efficacy in calf diarrhea is obtaining an effective antimicrobial concentration against bacteria at the sites of infection (small intestine and blood). 9 The results of fecal antimicrobial susceptibility testing in calf diarrhea probably have clinical relevance only when applied to fecal isolates of enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli or pathogenic Salmonella spp., and possibly blood culture isolates from calves with bacteremia. Current susceptibility testing methods have not been validated for predicting treatment outcome in calves with diarrhea. 9 The ability of fecal bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the Kirby Bauer technique to guide treatment in calf diarrhea is questionable when applied to fecal E. coli isolates that have not been identified as enterotoxigenic pathogenic strains. No reports have demonstrated a correlation between in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of fecal E. coli and Salmonella spp. isolates and clinical response to antimicrobial treatment. Susceptibility results obtained from dead calves should be interpreted carefully because isolates obtained from dead calves are likely to be obtained from treatment failures, and calves that died from diarrhea are likely to have bacterial overgrowth in the intestines and many organs not representing the in vivo situation. Another concern with fecal susceptibility testing is that the Kirby Bauer break points (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]) are not based on typical antimicrobial concentrations in the small intestine and blood of calves. The practitioner should therefore evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy based on clinical response to antibiotic treatment. 9 The Kirby Bauer technique for antimicrobial susceptibility test has theoretically more clinical relevance for predicting the clinical response to antimicrobial treatment when applied to blood isolates than fecal isolates. This is because the Kirby Bauer break points (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]) are based on achievable antimicrobial concentrations in human plasma and MIC 90 (MIC for 90% of the isolates) values for human E. coli isolates, which provide a reasonable approximation to achievable MIC values in calf plasma and MIC 90 values for bovine E. coli isolates. 9",

Dairy heifer calves were fed with milk replacer containing antibiotics on 56% of herds in 2001 in the United States. 6 Local surveys reported between 45% (Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Wisconsin) 7 and 70% (Pennsylvania) 5 of dairy herds are using medicated milk replacer. Oxytetracycline in combination with neomycin followed by oxytetracycline alone are the most common medications. 6 Several studies reported inconsistent results of the effects of antibiotics containing milk replacer on the incidence of diarrhea (scours). The incidence of diarrhea was not influenced when antibiotics in milk replacer were compared with oligosaccharides or bovine plasma as nonantibiotic alternative treatments. [35] [36] [37] A more extensive recent study found that the onset and overall morbidity of important diseases in calves during their first weeks of life (diarrhea, respiratory disease, navel infection) were significantly lower in calves receiving antibiotics neomycin sulphate (22 mg/kg/day) and tetracycline HCl (22 mg/kg/day) in milk replacer than in control calves without in-feed antibiotics. 38 This study did not exclusively consider diarrhea as the primary outcome, but the findings are valuable because they reflect the pattern of diseases in newborn calves in a specialized calf-rearing facility with high disease incidence in a stressful environment.",

The administration of a single dose of flunixin meglumine (2.2 mg/kg [1 mg/lb] IM) as an adjunct treatment for naturally occurring diarrhea resulted in fewer morbid-days and antimicrobial treatments only when calves had fecal blood in their feces. 41 In calves with experimentally induced enterotoxigenic E. coli infection, flunixin meglumine (2.2 mg/kg [1 mg/lb] q8h IM) reduced fecal output perhaps by acting as an antisecretory agent. 42 Flunixin meglumine (2.2 mg/kg [1 mg/lb] q12h) is indicated in severely sick calves with presumed endotoxemia when hydration status is adequate to prevent nephrotoxicity. A rule of thumb is to administer flunixin meglumine once at a dose 2.2 mg/kg (1 mg/lb) and not to exceed three doses of flunixin meglumine for the treatment of diarrhea and respiratory disease to avoid potential damage of the intestinal mucosa of the abomasum, especially in intensive calf-rearing facilities with a history of case fatalities from perforated abomasal ulcers. An important effect of flunixin meglumine administration is the clinical impression that calves show a better suckle behavior after therapy. This impression is supported by a recent statement that \"the use of flunixin meglumine is valuable in improving the well-being of the calves.\" 38",
