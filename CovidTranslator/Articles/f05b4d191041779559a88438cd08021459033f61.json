Suddenly, the efforts and time that man had spent in hunting and gathering food were no longer necessary as domestic animals provided a continuous source of food supply. The process of domestication spread across Asia, Europe, and North Africa during the Neolithic 'agricultural revolution'. This was a significant breakthrough in human history and played a fundamental role in the development of most modern societies. Today, domestic animals represent one of the major sources of proteins for a significant portion of the world's population. Animal husbandry practices have changed since the Neolithic and vary in different geographical areas.",

For example, the estimated direct cost to agriculture and the food industry of the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in Great Britain was around \u00a33 billion (British pounds; approximately US$6 billion), but the indirect costs to other businesses such as tourism were estimated to be another \u00a33 billion.",

Girolamo Fracastoro in 1546 wrote a paper suggesting that diseases were caused by 'seminaria contagiosa', entities that could be transmitted by direct or indirect contact. In the seventeenth century, the invention of the microscope allowed for the first time to see 'wee animalcules' that we know now to be bacteria, algae, and protozoa. However, the invention of the microscope reinforced the prevalent idea at the time that microorganisms generate spontaneously in the air (miasma). It was in the nineteenth century that Louis Pasteur convinced the scientific community that the growth of such microorganisms is not due to spontaneous generation, although this point had been suggested previously by others.",

            "text": "With the advent of solid media and Petri dishes, a wave of previously unknown bacteria (and their associated diseases) was discovered and bacteriology was established as probably the first exact medical science. Soon afterward it was clear that not all diseases were caused by bacteria and the existence of a new class of submicroscopic microorganisms appeared in the scientific arena. In 1898 Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch, two former students of Robert Koch, first demonstrated that an animal disease could be caused by 'ultrafilterable agents'. Working on FMD, Loeffler and Frost collected fluid from vesicular lesions of affected animals and filtered it through bacteria-proof filter candles, hoping that the infectious agent would be retained in the filter. To their surprise, calves inoculated with the filtrate developed FMD lesions. Subsequent studies allowed them to rule out the possibility of a bacterial etiology, and thus foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) became the first virus of vertebrates to be discovered (tobacco mosaic virus of plants had been discovered by Ivanovski in 1892). These landmark studies were published between 1897 and 1898. It should be noted that at the end of the nineteenth century, FMD was causing a large number of outbreaks in Germany and the magnitude of the problem was such that in 1893 the Prussian Ministry of Agriculture offered a prize of 3000 reichmarks for the person who could identify the cause of the disease. After 2 years of fruitless efforts by a number of different applicants, a research commission was established to systematically investigate FMD. About 55 000 reichmarks were invested in this venture and soon paid off with the results obtained by Loeffler and Frosch. Because of the highly contagious nature of the disease, in 1909 Loeffler had to move to an island in the Baltic Sea, Insel Reims, in order to continue studying FMD. Thus, despite the recent FMD incidents in the United Kingdom, the awareness of biosecurity against devastating animal diseases was already well developed a century ago.",

Cattle plague (or rinderpest) is a disease that devastated livestock for hundreds of years in Europe until the nineteenth century. In the previous century, the consequences of cattle plague were so serious that Pope Clement XI instructed his physician, Giovanni Maria Lancisi, to develop measures to control the disease. Lancisi's recommendations included the destruction of all ill and suspect animals followed by their burial in lime. The first veterinary school was opened in Lyon specifically to teach Lancisi's principles. Today, we apply sanitary measures remarkably similar to those devised by Lancisi to avoid the spread of transmissible diseases: quarantine, animal movement restrictions, and culling of affected animals. The effectiveness of these measures is illustrated by the fact that rinderpest was eliminated from Europe prior to the discovery of its causative agent. Thus, Lancisi is correctly recognized as the first hygienist in history.",

            "text": "Some historical diseases are indirectly linked to domestic animals, although only directly affecting humans. Smallpox has been one of the greatest scourges of humankind. The origins of variola virus (VARV), the etiologic agent of smallpox, are uncertain but it is speculated that VARV derives from an ancestral poxvirus that affected animals during the early agricultural settlements in Asia or Africa. Interestingly, the closest relative of VARV is camelpox virus (CMLV). Despite its long history of terrifying lethality, smallpox is the first (and so far only) viral disease that has been globally eradicated, thanks to a very effective vaccine campaign. The basis of this achievement can be traced back to the end of the eighteenth century when Edward Jenner (1749-1823) laid the foundations of modern vaccinology. In Jenner's time, it was a popular belief that cowpox protected against smallpox, since dairymaids were immune to the disease. A physician himself, Jenner combined folk knowledge, comparative medicine (cowpox lesions in cattle were similar to those in people affected by smallpox), and hypothesis-driven research to carry out one of the most significant experiments in microbiology: he inoculated a number of people with material from cowpox lesions and further challenged them by variolation (a procedure that consisted in blowing dried smallpox scabs into the nose of an individual). Variolated individuals usually contracted a mild form of the disease, but the group treated by Jenner did not show any reaction, demonstrating that cowpox infection was protective against smallpox. This procedure marked the beginning of a new era in medicine. Despite initial resistance to Jenner's methods, vaccination as a strategy to prevent smallpox and later other infectious diseases was rapidly accepted. Pasteur developed the first attenuated vaccine against a disease of chickens (chicken cholera caused by Pasteurella multocida) and also produced vaccines against two lethal zoonoses: anthrax and rabies. Linked to the success of the smallpox vaccination was the development of a vaccine against tuberculosis. Bovine tuberculosis (Figure 1(a) ) was first recognized in 1854 and Robert Koch subsequently determined that Mycobacterium bovis, the cause of bovine tuberculosis, could be differentiated from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the cause of human tuberculosis. This led to the speculation that a successful vaccine for human tuberculosis (TB) could be generated by employing the same strategy that was successful for smallpox. However, early attempts at using freshly isolated M. bovis strains were unsuccessful as these were as virulent as M. tuberculosis. The veterinary influence in producing an effective vaccine against TB was evident in the work of Camille Gu\u00e9rin, a veterinarian, and Albert Calmette, a physician, who together produced the M. bovis BCG (Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin) vaccine strain. This was a highly passaged strain with negligible virulence, which took over 13 years to develop and was finally ready for use in 1921. To this day, over 200 years after Jenner's pioneer studies, vaccination constitutes our best tool to fight infectious diseases of both domestic animals and man.",

In those pioneer studies, tumors were transmitted to animals by means of cell-free filtrates. Vilhelm Ellerman and Olaf Bang discovered that a virus caused erythroleukemia in chickens (1908), while Peyton Rous showed that sarcomas in chickens also had a viral etiology (1911) . At the time, unfortunately, those studies did not receive the credit they deserved, as leukemias were not regarded as cancer and chickens were not considered a relevant animal model for the study of human diseases. In the 1950s Howard Temin and Harry Rubin developed an assay (focus assay) to quantify Rous sarcoma virus (RSV, the virus discovered by Rous) in tissue culture (Figure 1(b) ). This assay revolutionized the study of RSV because it demonstrated the link between the biological activity of a single infectious viral particle and a single cell. Later, RSV was found to contain a cell-derived gene ('oncogene') that was sufficient to induce cell transformation. This was a major discovery as it highlighted that the DNA of the cells held the 'secret' of cancer. Thus, the genetic origin of cancer was discovered by studying chicken viruses. The RSV oncogene, v-src, was both the first oncogene and the first tyrosine kinase to be discovered and this had enormous repercussions, contributing to the foundation of entire disciplines such as signal transduction.",

Bj\u00f6rn Sigurdsson, an Icelandic physician, coined the term 'slow diseases' after studying a group of diseases of sheep that affected the Icelandic flocks in the 1930s-40s. In 1933 Iceland introduced a small number of rams from Germany to improve their genetic stock. Despite observing quarantine measures, the imported rams introduced at least three different diseases onto the island: ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA), paratuberculosis, and Maedi-visna. Another disease of sheep, scrapie, was also included in this group of diseases although it was probably imported to the island before 1933. The geographical and epidemiological circumstances of the outbreaks allowed Sigurdsson to develop the concept that an infectious agent can cause disease after a very long incubation period that can last from several months to years (slow diseases). This concept has had enormous influence on the study and control of infectious diseases.",

This group of diseases, named after the typical 'spongious' appearance of the neurons of affected animals, includes human Kuru, TSE of mink, and chronic wasting disease of deer represented a fascinating biological enigma that led to the postulation of the prion theory. Stanley Prusiner hypothesized that an infectious protein, devoid of nucleic acid, was the cause of TSEs and was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1997 for his studies. In humans, Kuru was initially described by Carleton Gajdusek and Vincent Zigas, who were working in Papua Guinea with the Fore tribe. Gajdusek was the first to link the occurrence of the disease with the cannibalistic rituals of the tribe, in particular with the consumption of the brains of affected people. Although scrapie had been known for a long time before the first description of Kuru, the initial connection between these two diseases was made by a veterinarian, William Hadlow, who recognized that the lesions observed in neurons of individuals affected by Kuru were strikingly similar to those of sheep affected by scrapie.",

One of the best examples to illustrate the relationship between animal pathogens and public health is influenza, a viral disease that caused the death of over 20 million people in the last century. Wild aquatic birds are considered the primary hosts of influenza virus A, the causative agent of flu. Influenza virus usually replicates in the intestinal tract of these birds, causes no disease, and is transmitted by fecal contamination of water. Occasionally, such viruses establish stable lineages in land-based birds and a limited number of mammalian species including swine, horses, dogs, and humans. The H5N1 subtype of avian flu currently poses a pandemic threat: it has caused large outbreaks of the disease among bird populations in Southeast Asia, and the number of human cases reached almost 400 at the beginning of 2008.",

The main route of transmission in cattle is via aerosol through the respiratory tract, although infection can also occur through abrasions either on the skin or on the mucosal membranes. Infected animals develop viremia and the virus is excreted in urine, feces, semen, and milk (particularly in dairy cattle). Clinical signs usually take place shortly after infection (between 2 and 14 days depending on the dose and infection route) and include hyperthermia and vesicular lesions in various areas such as feet and tongue. Aerosol infection is less common in pigs than in cattle, although swine shed much more virus through aerosol than sheep and cattle. As with the latter, the length of the incubation period depends on the dose and inoculation route. Lesions in swine most commonly affect feet and when observed in the tongue they are usually small.

Highly pathogenic influenza viruses exhibit high mortality rates, but animals that survive the infection display cessation of egg laying, respiratory signs, diarrhea, and edema of the head, neck, and face. If birds are affected by strains of lower pathogenicity, there is still a considerable reduction on egg production and weight gain, as well as respiratory disease. In avian species, viral replication takes place both in the intestinal and in the respiratory tract, and systemic replication is common when virulent strains are involved. As mentioned before, aquatic migratory birds are the main natural reservoir of the virus. Because these birds can remain healthy upon infection, they are able to carry and distribute the virus between different countries -and even continents -during migrations. Through contact in surface waters, the fecal-oral route may account for the efficient transmission of influenza viruses since infected aquatic birds excrete virus with feces, which in turn can remain infectious for up to 4 days in lake water. In dogs, canine influenza was identified in 2004 in United States after an outbreak that affected racing greyhounds in Florida. Phylogenetic studies showed that canine influenza is the result of interspecies transmission of a complete equine influenza virus to the dog.

The final phase of the disease is characterized by severe hemorrhagic diarrhea and prostration, followed by dehydration and death (affected animals usually die 6-12 days after symptoms appear). Infection is initiated in the upper respiratory tract, usually through nasal entry, and is followed by initial replication in the tonsils and local lymph nodes. The virus then spreads to other lymphatic tissues through blood and lymph.

ASFV possesses two distinct lipid membranes: an external one, obtained from the cellular membrane during budding, and an internal one that surrounds the inner core of the particle and is likely derived from the endoplasmic reticulum of the infected cell. Depending on environmental factors, ASF displays two distinct epidemiological patterns: a sylvatic and a domestic cycle. The former takes place in southern and eastern Africa and consists of the infections of wild pigs and soft ticks. Infection is likely to occur in the burrows used by these animals. It is estimated that up to 25% of the soft tick population in southern and eastern Africa is infected with ASFV. Ticks become infected after a blood meal on an infected wild pig. Infected ticks can transmit virus to other ticks and to their offspring, as well as to wild pigs at each blood meal. This cycle can take place multiple times along the lifespan of a tick as they can live for several years. In warthogs, seroepidemiological studies have shown that ASF is widely distributed. However, because adult warthogs are rarely viremic, it is thought that the young are the ones from which ticks become infected.

In domestic swine, the incubation period ranges from 5 to 15 days, and the clinical features of ASF include fever (41-42 C for about 4 days), diarrhea, inappetence, incoordination, prostration, coma, and death. Vomiting, nasal and conjunctival discharge, dyspnea, and anal and nasal hemorrhages can also be observed in some animals. Abortion is common in affected sows. In regions where the disease is exotic, mortality rates often reach 100% with an average survival time between 2 and 9 days. In endemic areas, ASF cases can be predominantly subclinical and persistent. Pathological findings are typically observed in the lymphatic and vascular systems and include widespread hemorrhages in spleen, lymph nodes, kidneys, and the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts (Figure 3) . Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, B and T cell lymphopenia, together with apoptosis of mononuclear cells and lymphocytes, is also common. Death probably occurs as a result of extensive necrosis in conjunction with hemostatic and hemodynamic changes. In subacute forms of the disease, hemorrhages are not as prominent as in acute cases and typical symptoms include loss of condition, swelling of the joints, as well as respiratory and cardiac signs. In chronic cases lesions include cutaneous ulcers, pericarditis, pneumonia, arthritis, and pleuritis. Animals that survive the infection develop protective immunity. Because ASF clinical signs are similar to other swine diseases, in particular to CSF, laboratory diagnosis is essential. Viral isolation and antigen detection can be readily done on samples from spleen, visceral lymph nodes, and blood. Different factors make prevention and control of ASF difficult: the lack of an efficient vaccine; the ability of ASFV to transmit in fresh meat; the presence of soft ticks that can act as biological vectors in some regions of the world; the possibility of persistent infection in a fraction of infected pigs; and the existence of a sylvatic cycle in sub-Saharan Africa. Countries that are free of the disease maintain such status by banning the importation of pigs or pig-derived products from endemic countries. Introduction of ASF in an uninfected country requires rapid and effective measures of control, such as slaughter of affected and in-contact animals, control of swine movement within and across affected regions, prohibition of feeding with waste food, and fumigation of infested facilities if soft ticks are prevalent in the affected area. Currently, there is no available vaccine. Measures to control the disease include quarantine and slaughter of affected animals.",

Morbidity and mortality rates range from 1 to 10% of the animals, although during an outbreak of sheeppox over 75% of the flock can be affected and lethality can reach up to 100% in young animals, as they are the most susceptible group. In countries where the disease is enzootic, indigenous breeds seem to be more resistant to the infection than exotic ones. The presence of sheeppox and goatpox in a region affects animal trading, and hence their economical importance. After an incubation period of 4-8 days, infected animals show a variety of clinical signs that include high body temperature, nasal discharge, hypersensitivity, and arched back. Appearance of typical pox lesions (Figure 4) such as macules and papules takes place a couple of days after the onset of the initial signs and can cover the entire body. Notably, nodular lesions in a variety of organs such as abomasum, trachea, and lungs are common. In the skin, SPV infection results in marked changes in the epidermis, hypodermis, and dermis. Both diseases are clinically comparable; they are serologically indistinguishable from one another and highly contagious. Transmission occurs by direct contact between infected and susceptible animals. Transmission via aerosol, insect vectors, and contaminated objects is also suspected. Virus is present in milk and nasal secretions, and it can also be recovered from lung, skin, liver, and lymph nodes. In endemic countries, live attenuated and inactivated vaccines are commonly used.",

The disease is classified into four forms of different severity: the horse sickness fever, the subacute (or cardiac) form, the cardio-pulmonary form, and the peracute (or pulmonary) form. Susceptible horses most often display the cardio-pulmonary or the peracute form of AHS with a very high mortality rate, while donkeys usually display the milder clinical forms of the disease. Histopathological and clinical signs are the result of an increased permeability of the capillary walls and vasculitis of both small and medium-sized blood vessels. Diagnosis of AHS is traditionally based on virus isolation and virus neutralization for serotyping. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are also available for rapid diagnosis. Control measures in endemic areas include vaccination with attenuated AHSV strains.",

Velogens are the most virulent of NDVs; they may produce widespread hemorrhagic lesions in the gastrointestinal tract (viscerotropic strains), but can also cause neurologic signs (neurotropic strains). In contrast, infection with lentogenic viruses results in subclinical infections or at most a mild respiratory presentation. Mesogenic NDV exhibits an intermediate phenotype, with moderate respiratory disease and occasionally neurological signs. Although clinical signs depend on the age and the immune status of infected animals, symptoms such as dyspnea, clonic muscular gasping, and cyanosis of comb and wattles are suggestive of the disease and usually appear after an incubation period of around 5 days. Other signs include weakness, loss of appetite, and somnolence. When the nervous system is involved, typical symptoms include paralysis of wings or legs (or both), ataxia, torticollis, clonic spasms, and abnormal movements of the head. Signs of infection by viscerotropic NDV are foamy mucus in the pharynx, crop dilatation, and diarrhea. Egg production is immediately affected and eggs from infected animals exhibit a decrease in the quality of albumen together with loss or depigmentation of the shell. Given the relatively nonspecific clinical signs and the epidemiological importance of NDV, viral isolation (usually from brains, spleen, or lungs) and serological assays are required for diagnosis.",

Virulence of NDV depends on the cleavability of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion glycoprotein (F), similarly to influenza A viruses. Avirulent strains exhibit minimal basic residues at the cleavage sites, and hence only proteases present in the respiratory or intestinal tract can cleave them. The presence of multiple basic residues at the cleavage sites allows cleavage by ubiquitous proteases and increases the ability to develop a systemic infection.
