Sensitivity of the PCR and cell culture methods for influenzavirus infections were detected as 100 % and 100 %, respectively. Specificity of the PCR and DFA methods for RSV infections were detected as 96 % and 100 % respectively. Conclusions Prevalence of viral agents was detected as 39.4 %. Influenza viruses and RSV were common. Metapneumovirus was also frequent (3.6 %). C. pneumoniae was not found to be a common agent for acute respiratory disease in children.",

Most of the viruses are transmitted through respiratory droplets. While some of them can stay localized in the respiratory tract, some can show systemic dissemination. In two third of the ARTI, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial (RSV) virus, parainfluenzavirus, adenovirus, coronavirus and rhinovirus are responsible. Influenza is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants [2] . Parainfluenza viruses (PIV) are mostly seen in the lower respiratory tract infections of the children after RSV infection. Type 3 is common and approximately half of the children are infected in the first year after the birth. Adenovirus infections are endemic and cause infections mostly in the school ages; 50 % of these infections are asymptomatic. Infections with coronavirus is seasonal and is especially seen in the winter months. The infection caused by rhinovirus is seen throughout the year [3] . Metapneumovirus infections, like RSV infections are common in children younger than 2 y [4] . RSV infections are among the most important agents causing acute bronchitis and pneumonia in Turkey as in the world. Almost all of the children younger than 3 y may be infected with RSV [5] . C. pneumoniae, is responsible for 10-20 % of community-acquired atypical pneumonia in the childhood, 10 % of the acute bronchitis and 5-10 % of the pharyngitis cases [6] .",

Xiao et al, [23] detected viruses in 871 samples (74.76 %), among which RSV (27.03 %) was the most common virus, followed by human rhinovirus (17.33 %) in 1165 hospitalized children with ARTI.

Vidaurreta et al, [24] reported that rhinovirus was Influenza A H3 was detected as positive in eight patients by the PCR and influenza A H3N2 was specified in the cell culture of seven of these patients. Again when influenza B was found positive in three patients by the PCR, the influenza cultures of these three patients was found negative the most frequent followed by respiratory syncytial virus in children <5 y old with acute respiratory infections. Viral diagnosis was achieved in 81 % hospitalized and 57 % of outpatients in their study. They concluded that the use of viral diagnostic techniques allowed the identification of an etiologic agent in most of the hospitalized patients and more than half of outpatients. The addition of RT-PCR for rhinovirus, allowed the identification of this etiologic agent. The authors found the rhinovirus rate as the highest (14.7 %). The present result are in concordance with the study results of Vidaurreta et al, [24] Xie et al, [22] and Xiao et al, [23] .

They concluded that viruses from nasopharyngeal aspirates could be isolated in 36 (38 %).Khor et al, [25] detected 357 (13.2 %) parainfluenza viruses (type 3) in 10269 respiratory samples from all children with respiratory viral infections (less than or equal to) 5 y old. Xie et al, [22] found the positive rate of rhinovirus as 12 % in group of <1 y old. Ren et al, [32] reported that parainfluenza viruses were detected in 246 (12.2 %) children with ARTI, of whom 25 (10.2 %) were positive for parainfluenza virus 4, 11 (4.5 %) for parainfluenza virus 2, 51 (20.7 %) for parainfluenza virus 1, 151 (61.4 %) for parainfluenza virus 3. The authors detected 1 parainfluenza 3 (0.9 %) and 1 parainfluenza 4 (0.9 %) in children younger than 23 mo old. The present results are not in concordance with the other results. In other words, the present results were much lower than the results of other studies.",
