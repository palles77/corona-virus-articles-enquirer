The clinical presentation of MERS-CoV infection ranges from asymptomatic to very severe disease, and the classical presentation includes fever, cough chills, sore throat, myalgia, and arthralgia. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 339 healthcare personnel was conducted over an 8-month period in the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia using a structured survey that included demographic information and questions testing participant's knowledge.",

On the other hand, few respondents identified the proper number of strains or the genus (16.5% and 17.4%, respectively). More than half of the study sample identified the disease as zoonotic (57.2%, n = 194). Similarly, 89.1% (n = 302) identified that camels and bats are prone to infection with coronaviruses. Only 23.9% (n = 81) properly identified March through May as the season with the highest transmission rate. There was a massive lack of adequate knowledge regarding prevalence of antibodies. Only 18.3% (n = 62) of respondents identified PCR as the proper diagnostic confirmatory test for MERS-CoV infection. Regarding MERS-CoV clinical features, 76.4% (n = 259) recognized the presence of sub-clinical infection, 64.7% (n = 218) indicated that cases should be immediately isolated, and 46.9% (n = 159) identified the main cause of mortality as respiratory failure. Conclusions: There is limited microbiological and virological knowledge of MERS-CoV infection among healthcare personnel in the southern region of Saudi Arabia, although the clinical aspects are known.",

Since then, more than 1400 cases have been reported from KSA, with a mortality rate of about 40%. We conducted this study to assess knowledge and attitude towards MERS-CoV among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia. It is the first study conducted in the southern region of KSA, and the second in KSA overall; the first study, by Khan et al., was conducted over a 2-month period in two multispecialty hospitals of the Al-Qassim region in 2014. They found that the respondents had good knowledge of and positive attitude towards MERS-CoV. Specifically, healthcare workers were less educated about the management and consequences of MERS-CoV, while a majority were well aware of hallmark symptoms, precautionary measures, and hygiene issues [15] .",

Two-thirds knew about the lack of vaccination and that case management is mostly supportive care. From this study, we found that healthcare workers in the southern region of Saudi Arabia had moderate knowledge of MERS-CoV.
