Controls were age-group-matched children randomly selected from communities surrounding study sites. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP-OP), urine, blood, induced sputum, lung aspirate, pleural fluid, and gastric aspirates were tested with cultures, multiplex PCR, or both. Primary analyses were restricted to cases without HIV infection and with abnormal chest x-rays and to controls without HIV infection. We applied a Bayesian, partial latent class analysis to estimate probabilities of aetiological agents at the individual and population level, incorporating case and control data. Findings Between Aug 15, 2011, and Jan 30, 2014, we enrolled 4232 cases and 5119 community controls. The primary analysis group was comprised of 1769 (41\u00b78% of 4232) cases without HIV infection and with positive chest x-rays and 5102 (99\u00b77% of 5119) community controls without HIV infection.

Acknowledging that aetiology cannot be inferred from these results alone, we also developed a new analytical approach to assess the aetiological distribution of pneumonia. [7] [8] [9] This approach integrates microbiology results from multiple specimens types and multiple results for one pathogen from an individual; this approach also accounts for the sensitivity and specificity of the individual diagnostic tests used.

Additionally, we established an expert panel, the Pneumonia Methods Working Group (PMWG), to provide additional advice on the key epidemiological, laboratory, study design, and analytical issues that the PERCH study needed to optimise. The search dates, databases used, search terms, and restrictions are detailed in a separate publication (Zunera Gilani and colleagues, 2012). The results of our reviews of the pre-existing evidence and the decisions reached by the PMWG have been published in a set of methods papers and in the protocol. Since this review, the descriptive results of three large paediatric pneumonia aetiology studies in children younger than 5 years have been published-from the USA (EPIC), South Africa (Drakenstein), and a multicountry study (GABRIEL)-and were considered in our analysis.",

The emphasis on a single protocol with highly standardised implementation and quality control steps throughout the study conduct, the inclusion of diverse sites but with routine implementation of existing pneumonia vaccines, the duration of enrolment to capture seasonal trends, the use of a 33-target multiplex quantitative PCR, the inclusion of multiple body fluid specimens, the inclusion of an appropriate control group, the adjustment for the sensitivity of the laboratory tests, and the large size of the study all provided strength to the inferential value of the results. Our study provides results for over 30 pathogens and allows for cross-site comparisons of aetiological distribution because of its highly standardised methodology. It is the first infectious aetiology study to integrate the results of testing of multiple pathogens from multiple body fluid specimens, by using a range of laboratory assays, and to provide an aetiological distribution of the pathogens, with uncertainty intervals, both by individual and in the population. Our results showed that ten pathogens were responsible for 79-90% of cases with severe pneumonia requiring hospital admission in children younger than 5 years across a wide range of geographical and epidemiological settings.

Bacterial pathogens, cumulatively, caused a substantial proportion of disease and, being treatable and commonly fatal, should remain a target for early access to treatment. Our study clearly shows that the inferential value of nasopharyngeal specimens varies by pathogen, with only a low number of pathogens providing evidence of causality. The PERCH Integrated Analysis shows the value of analytical approaches that account for pathogen prevalence, test performance, multiple specimens, and multiple results for an individual pathogen. The methods developed by the PERCH study for integrating such data, in a principled approach, offer the opportunity for other aetiology studies to also adapt and use these methods.",

Severe pneumonia was defined as cough or difficulty breathing with lower chest wall indrawing; very severe pneumonia was defined as cough or difficulty breathing and at least one of the following signs: central cyanosis, difficulty breastfeeding or drinking, vomiting everything, convulsions, lethargy, unconsciousness, or head nodding. 12 Elevated respiratory rate was not part of case definitions (appendix). Exclusion criteria for cases and controls were hospitalisation within the preceding 14 days, having been discharged as a PERCH case within the preceding 30 days, and residence outside the study catchment area. Cases had the additional exclusion criterion of resolution of lower chest wall indrawing after bronchodilator therapy for children with wheeze. At all sites, case assessment occurred within 24 h of admission. In Bangladesh, children from the Dhaka site that met the case definition were identified at an outpatient clinic and referred for hospital admission; children whose parents refused hospital admission were still enrolled if they met all other inclusion criteria (n=33). Each site enrolled participants over a 24month period (appendix). Case screening was done 24 h per day and 7 days per week at four sites (Kilifi, Sa Kaeo, Nakhon Phanom, and Matlab), during which all eligible consenting cases were enrolled. At the remaining sites, screening was done during established hours; all eligible consenting cases presenting during predefined screening hours were enrolled, except for Mali, where a systematic sampling process was used (appendix).",

A secondary analysis of all cases without HIV infection, regardless of chest xray, was done and is reported in the appendix. 34 Children missing all laboratory measurements used in the integrated aetiology analysis (blood cultures, NPOP PCR, whole blood PCR, and tuberculosis cultures for cases; NPOP PCR and whole blood PCR for controls) were excluded from the analyses. For children with at least one of these measure ments, any missing data for the other measurements were imputed during model estimation by use of standard Bayesian methods. 35 Statistical comparisons of demographic and clinical characteristics between sites and casecontrol groups were done with logistic regression that adjusted for age in months, with or without site as appropriate. We compared the prevalence of organisms measured in both cases and controls using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs calculated by logistic regression, adjusting for site, age in months, and the other pathogens detected (this adjustment for NPOP PCR results alone); we could not adjust for previous antibiotic use because it was rare among controls.

[7] [8] [9] 36 This method assumes that infections at body sites peripheral to the lung are indicative of the cause of the putative lung infection and that measurements are independent of one another. This method was tested with use of simulated datasets comprising cases with known aetiology who had a mix of measurements that varied in their sensitivity and specificity, which were prespecified, and it was shown to give accurate estimates of the aetiological fraction, even under mild violations of the independence assumption. 9 The PIA model uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that, on con vergence, samples from the posterior distribution of the aetiology estimates, given the observed measurements (appendix). The populationlevel estimate for each pathogen is the average of the individual case probabilities and has a 95% credible interval (95% CrI), the Bayesian analogue of the confidence interval. Sensitivity analyses were done to assess the influence of the values used for aetiology and sensitivity priors (appendix). To allow for the possibility that the pneumonia event was caused by a pathogen not tested for, we included a pathogen category termed not otherwise specified (NOS). Cases who had negative tests for all pathogens or positive results only in measurements with poor specificity had a higher individuallevel probability to be included in NOS category than other cases.",

Although well described as a cause of upper respiratory tract infection, the role of human rhinovirus as a cause of pneumonia is uncertain.

We investigated the site performance of blood collection and culture and found no methodological explanation for the inability to isolate S pneumoniae from blood cultures at these three sites, nor for the lower prevalence of positive pneumococcal results in the Asian sites compared with that of other sites. However, the South Africa site had two blood culture samples that were alarm positive, culture negative, with pneumococci in chains detected on Gram stain, and Binax positive, and all three sites isolated pneumococci from blood in patients who were not enrolled in the PERCH study during the same period. Antibiotic treatment before specimen collection is known to influence the isolation of bacteria from blood and NP, as we have previously described, 25,28 but does not substantially influence pneumococcal detection by whole blood PCR. 26 , 27 The prevalence of antibiotic pretreatment was particularly high in Zambia (92%), South Africa (57%), and Kenya (35%); this was accounted for, as described previously, by reducing the sensitivity. There were reasons to expect that, in our study, there would be a lower burden of pneumococcal disease than in earlier studies. By design, sites with PCV in routine use were targeted for participation in the PERCH study (all except Zambia, Thailand, and Bangladesh used PCV), which could have reduced the pneumococcal pneumonia disease burden by approximately 70% at those sites, if the serotype distribution matched that of invasive pneumococcal disease. 45 The low pneumococcal aetiological attribution is supported by the low prevalence of radiographic consolidation that has been shown to be associated with bacterial pneumonia, 46-48 which comprised only 25% of all PERCH cases and half of the cases with a positive chest xray. Furthermore, 60% of cases in the PERCH study were younger than 1 year, with many younger than 6 months, a group often excluded from the analyses of clinical trials of pneumococcal vaccine that partly formed the basis for our expectations about pneumococcal burden. Economic development and improved access to care might also have reduced hospital admissions for pneumococcal pneumonia through effective early outpatient treatment. In some sites, such as Thailand, the absence of any detected cases of pneumococcal bacteraemia might simply reflect low enrolment numbers, given that invasive pneumococcal disease has been observed at this site in other studies. [49] [50] [51] Among other vaccinepreventable pathogens, M tuberculosis burden varied by site, accounting for 6-10% of the aetiology in four sites (The Gambia, Zambia, South Africa, and Thailand), but less than 3% elsewhere. M tuberculosis was rarely cultured from induced sputum or gastric aspirates and, in the South Africa site, testing more than one specimen increased the yield. 52 The sensitivity of M tuberculosis culture is low when testing a ",

Perhaps owing to high vaccination rates, B pertussis was rarely identified but, when present, was most often found in children younger than 12 months. Detection of B pertussis by PCR of NPOP specimens was highly predictive of case status, with very few positives identified in controls. 54 We saw few cases that were clinically compatible with measles, therefore it is unlikely that we missed many measlesrelated cases of pneumonia, highlighting the efforts of measles control at the sites during the study. Hib was an uncommon cause for pneumonia in our study and was less com mon than nontype b H influenzae. The longstanding use of Hib vaccine in several study sites could have accounted for the low contribution of Hib to the aetiological distribution. However, the two sites where the contribution of Hib exceeded the contribution of nonb H influenzae (Mali and Zambia) did not have the lowest Hib vaccination rates. Thailand was the only site not using Hib vaccine; the reason for the small contribution of Hib to pneumonia aetiology in Thailand is unclear, but might relate to access to outpatient antibiotics. P jirovecii is a prominent cause of pneumonia among children with HIV infection. The PERCH study has shown that it is also a relevant cause of pneumonia in a subset of children without HIV infection. Among cases, those who had P jirovecii detected in the NPOP specimens were more likely than other cases to be younger than 6 months and malnourished. To the best of our knowledge, the single case of legionellosis (in the Zambia site) that we identified is the first reported case of childhood infection due to L longbeachae in Africa.",

However, NPOP specimens provide little inferential value to the cause of pneumonia at the individual case level, except for a small group of pathogens, such as RSV and B pertussis.

            "text": "The PERCH study results can be compared with other childhood pneumonia aetiology studies. 29, 39, 65, 66 The multisite BOSTID study 66, 67 from the 1980s, an important historical reference, detected viruses and bacteria from upper respiratory specimens and bacterial antigens from urine specimens and found high prevalence of RSV, S pneumoniae, and Hib. The PERCH study differed substantially from BOSTID in study design through the inclusion of controls, in strict standardisation of case definitions and methods, and in the breadth and types of laboratory testing. The multicountry GABRIEL pneumonia casecontrol aetiology study, 65 done in low income settings and published in 2017, also highlighted RSV as a major causative pathogen. However, the aetiological attribution for RSV was substantially lower in the GABRIEL study than in the PERCH study (18% vs 31%). 65 This discordance appears mainly attributable to differences in the prevalence of RSV in GABRIEL (20% of cases) compared with that in the PERCH study (29% of cases), rather than a result of different analytical approaches. Study design and methodological differences probably affected the rate of RSV detection; specifically, the age distribution of cases enrolled in GABRIEL was older than that of cases in PERCH, and GABRIEL controls were enrolled from facilities, rather than from the community. Although S pneumoniae detection in NP specimens in cases was similar between the two studies (68% in GABRIEL vs 73% in PERCH [any detection]), the control prevalence was considerably lower in GABRIEL (48% vs 77%), resulting in a high OR and attributable fraction in the GABRIEL study. The difference in pneumococcal findings between the PERCH and GABRIEL studies is unlikely to lie in the case definitions used, which were similar between studies. Instead, notable differences existed in PCV use (nearly absent in GABRIEL, but widely used in PERCH) and in control eligibility (facility based recruitment and no respiratory symptoms in GABRIEL vs community controls regardless of respi ratory symptoms, if not casedefining, in PERCH). Additionally, the proportion of cases and controls who had detection of both viruses and bacteria was sub stantially higher in PERCH (83\u00b75% cases and 75\u00b78% of controls had mixed bacterialviral detection) than in GABRIEL (59\u00b76% cases and 36\u00b71% controls), suggesting that other differences in the selection of participants or in clinical or laboratory methods might have also contributed. In the EPIC study 38 of childhood pneumonia aetiology from the USA, RSV and human rhinovirus were the most commonly detected pathogens from the upper respiratory tract among young children hospitalised with radiographic pneumonia, and a larger proportion of children had no pathogen detected compared with that of PERCH (18\u00b79% in EPIC vs 0\u00b79% in PERCH). In the South African Drakenstein case control substudy 29 of pneumonia aetiology (using the same multiplex PCR assay as PERCH), cases were predominantly children with nonsevere pneumonia, managed in outpatient settings, and with a median age of 5 months. Nevertheless, a range of pathogens similar to that of the PERCH study was associated with pneumonia case status, but the prevalence of influenza was higher. Unlike the PERCH study of severe pneumonia with hospital admission, the Drakenstein substudy found that cytomegalovirus, bocavirus, and adenovirus were associated with case status. 29 Our study has several limitations, particularly related to viral pathogens as confounders of pneumonia aetiology, to the copathogen interpretation, and to bacterial aetiology. Our descriptive analysis underscored limitations inherent to nearly every pneumonia aetiology study-multiple specimens, multiple tests with varying sensitivity and specificity, and the absence of an established and principled method to integrate the results in a single aetiology analysis-and justifies the novel analytical approach we have taken. As in all casecontrol studies, residual confounding cannot be excluded. Despite matching controls by community of residence, age, and season of cases, there are likely to be factors that influence nasopharyngeal infection and independently influence infection with significant lung pathogens (eg, crowding); this could overestimate the role of viruses and underestimate the role of bacteria. The PIA model integrates the multiple observed laboratory results, acknowledging the inherent error in laboratory meas urements, the reduced sensitivity of assays because of previous antibiotic use or low blood culture volume, and the indirect nature of data obtained from sampling body fluids distant from the lung. The model assumes each case has a primary pathogen as the cause and does not attempt to estimate whether specific pathogen combinations are necessary for pneumonia. This approach has been described in detail elsewhere 9 and has been contrasted with the standard attributable fraction method. The PIA model includes assumptions on the sensitivity of laboratory measures and aetiology priors, each with a range provided. The validity of the assumptions regarding sensitivity is limited by the availability of data on diagnostic test performance. Despite the potential misspecification of these assumptions, sensitivity analyses showed that the aetiology results were robust to changes in these values, except the aetiology prior for NOS. 9 Furthermore, the inherent ability of an observational study to accurately define the contribution of bacteria to pneumonia is uncertain. To advance this problem will require better diagnostics (such as discriminating PCR in blood samples or other pathogenspecific, infection specific biomarkers), specimens other than the NPOP swabs (such as lung aspirates, which are very challenging to obtain), and the sampling of patients before they have had antibiotics, which, in the era of community case management, is increasingly unlikely. A vaccine probe study is the optimal way to reveal the contribution of a pathogen to pneumonia, 68 but this can only be undertaken for one or two pathogens at a time. Finally, the allsite PERCH study pneumonia aetiological distribution reflected estimates of the distribution of cases with pneumonia who were admitted to a hospital, outside of the neonatal period, across the PERCH study sites during the period of observation. We recognise that pneumonia is an important illness in neonates. Because there was a sister study, ANISA, 69 assessing the causes of neonatal disease during the same period, the PERCH study focused on children outside the neonatal period.",

RSV is the most common cause of serious pneumonia with hospital admission in these settings and should be a target for dedicated prevention and treatment efforts. Bacterial pathogens cumulatively cause a substantial proportion of disease and, because they are treatable and commonly fatal, should remain as targets for early access to appropriate supportive and curative treatment. The PERCH study estimated that 61% of pneumonia requiring hospital admission in children younger than 5 years and without HIV infection had a primary viral cause; however, we cannot firmly exclude the presence of bacterial co infection, as discussed above. Nevertheless, this finding strengthens the need to adjust pneumonia treatment algorithms to emphasise supportive care and identify children for whom antibiotics are unlikely to be therapeutic, thereby reducing the pressure for anti microbial resistance. Future pneumonia research needs to address the conundrum of multiple pathogens and the sequence of their role in pneumonia pathogenesis. The findings from the PERCH study should prompt additional investments in pneumonia prevention, testing, triage, and treatment and should encourage the use of innovative design and analyses in aetiology studies, especially those that can further assess pneumonia as a multipathogen disease. and do not necessarily represent the official position of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Department of Health and Human Services, or the US Government.",
