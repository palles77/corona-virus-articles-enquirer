            "text": "Since 2009, influenza viruses of the A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) subtypes as well as influenza B viruses have been responsible for human influenza diseases in the northern hemisphere [11, 12, 33, 35, 37] . Nevertheless, infections with a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A(H5N1) have been observed in the human population. According to data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), as of August 10, 2012, a total of 608 human infections caused by A(H5N1) were laboratory confirmed, and 359 fatal cases (59.0 %) were reported since 2003 [36] . Thus, despite the fact that the end of the pandemic caused by A(H1N1)pdm09 was announced in August 2010, there is still a potential threat of another influenza pandemic caused by HPAI A(H5N1) virus [32] . Certainly, the high level of changeability of influenza viruses together with an animal reservoir for these pathogens makes it possible that a completely new virus variant with pandemic potential will emerge [6, 21, 30] . Therefore, high-quality surveillance together with the availability of rapid and accurate diagnostic methods is a big challenge in the case of influenza virus infections. Subtyping of influenza viruses is necessary for surveillance and usually is less important for the diagnosis of an individual patient's illness, since a clinical diagnosis of influenza is sufficient to commence appropriate treatment [34] . Nevertheless, when a new influenza virus variant is suspected to cause human infections, as was the case with the H1N1 of swine origin in 2009, virus subtyping seems to be justified and necessary to differentiate between the new variant and the older ones [31] . This may be required for appropriate control of infections and case management, especially at the beginning of a new outbreak.",

            "text": "Different laboratory techniques may be used for diagnostics of influenza infections, but nucleic acid amplification techniques have become the most useful, rapid, specific and sensitive when compared to other methods [20, 26, 34 ]. An improvement in influenza diagnostics depends not only on the technical capabilities of the laboratory equipment but also the skills of the users to apply these pieces of equipment in an optimal way to accomplish specific goals. Therefore, many efforts have been undertaken to develop multiplex PCR or real-time PCR (qPCR) reactions enabling different viruses or different types/subtypes of the same virus to be detected in a single reaction. The development of multiplex qPCR reactions is a difficult task, especially when three or more target genes are to be detected in one reaction. These difficulties are caused by overlapping of fluorescence of fluorophores used for probe labelling. Another difficulty emerges from the changeability of influenza viruses, and this mostly applies to the genes encoding haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which determine the subtype of the influenza virus [6, 21] . Thus, the design of appropriate primers and probes enabling the detection of different viruses of a given subtype is a big challenge.",

            "text": "Early detection and virological surveillance of influenza virus strains circulating regionally and globally is a key element in both updating the influenza vaccine composition and epidemic/pandemic prevention and control [29, 34] . The co-circulation of multiple types and subtypes of seasonal influenza viruses increases the difficulty of virus identification and diagnosis. Molecular methods based on PCR allow rapid, accurate, sensitive and direct detection of influenza viruses, including subtyping of influenza virus A, and have become a valuable tool in a routine diagnostics as well as surveillance. However, the high level of genetic variability of influenza viruses, especially among viruses of type A, makes the development of specific molecular assays difficult. Simultaneously, this changeability requires diagnostic methods to be constantly monitored and updated in the event of the emergence of a new genetically distinct strain. Many multiplex qPCR assays for detection of influenza viruses have been developed [2, 5, 7-9, 14, 27, 28] . Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there is only one paper describing multiplex assays for the detection of each of the following influenza viruses: type B, subtypes A(H3N2), A(H5N1) and A(H1N1) but without differentiation between A(H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal A(H1N1) [24] . Thus, three duplex qPCR assays designed in this study for concurrent detection of influenza B, A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H5N1) viruses offer a valuable strategic diagnostics approach and could be routinely adapted for the identification of not only seasonal influenza viruses circulating in the human population but also the unusual H5N1 subtype of avian origin. Genes that encode internal virus proteins such as the non-structural NS protein are highly conserved among different influenza viruses and thus are useful targets for the universal detection of virus type [34] . Since all influenza virus subtypes are defined on the basis of differences in their surface glycoproteins, haemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene targets are the most effective and recommended approach for specific subtyping of influenza A viruses [13] . In the present study, the corresponding genes have been also shown to be useful for differentiation of specific types and subtypes. However, because of the large variability among A(H5N1) strains, two primer/probe sets were selected for the efficient detection of N1. Both probes were labelled with the same fluorophores because the duplex reaction was designed for identification of N1 without differentiation between A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H5N1). In multiplex qPCR, amplicons are discriminated by using distinct fluorogenic probes for each nucleic acid target or, alternatively, melting curves when nonspecific DNA-intercalating fluorophores are used as the detection method [18] . The limited number of fluorophores, which show significant overlap in their emission spectra, as well as the finite number of emission channels in a qPCR instrument, limits the number of targets that can be detected a in a single reaction by multiplexing [15, 18] . In the present study, a LightCycler \u00d2 2.0 system with an LED light source was used. A duplex format of the reaction was based on hydrolysis of probes labelled with JOE reporter dye and the quencher BHQ-1 or California Fluor Red 610 and the quencher BHQ-2. Despite the two different emission maxima of the fluorophores and measurement of fluorescence in two different detection channels (560 nm for JOE and 610 nm for California Fluor Red 610), the use of color compensation software was necessary due to overlapping of fluorescence. According to literature data [15] as well as our results (data not shown), the Light-Cycler \u00d2 2.0 is an appropriate and well-working platform to detect up to two different fluorophores in a single reaction with TaqMan probes. Designed primer and probe sets labelled in the proposed format can be differently combined and, after validation, used in other duplex formats: (H1)pdm09 with N1, H3 with N2, and H5 with N1. Then, a complete identification of a specific subtype, including haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, is possible.",

The newly developed assays resulted in eight additional positives that were missed by the routine IF method. Moreover, three specimens that were positive for influenza A virus in IFA were actually negative, as each qPCR assay and also virus isolation (data not shown) gave negative results.

The sensitivity of IFA is significantly influenced by the quality of the specimen, since virus-infected cells are very labile and may be easy damaged by inappropriate handling or storage of clinical specimens before processing. Moreover, the analysis and interpretation of results obtained by IFA are often subjective, depending on the experience of the investigator. Molecular methods allow the detection of nucleic acids from viable as well as non-viable viruses, even when the viral copy number is low, and thus exhibit the highest sensitivity. Although PCR methods may be affected by PCR inhibitors, the occurrence of inhibition of amplification in respiratory specimens is rare. Among 545 respiratory specimens tested by Stauffer et al. [25] , only 12 (2.2 %) were inhibited in PCR. In addition, RNA/DNAdegrading enzymes present in the specimens, as well as reagent degradation, may reduce the sensitivity of PCR Detection of seasonal and avian influenza viruses using qPCR 1751 reactions. Therefore, apart from negative and positive controls, an internal control confirming the presence of human nucleic acids and indicating the acceptable quality of specimen and template, should be also used in each run. In the duplex assays described here, the internal control was not included, and thus all negative samples were tested for the presence of inhibitors to eliminate false negative results.",

On one hand, high specificity of the primers and probe is crucial for qPCR assays. On the other hand, nucleotide variation in a primer/probe binding region of newly emerging strains may lead to much lower efficiency of hybridisation of a primer or probe with the template. As a consequence of this, a significant decrease in assay sensitivity -or even false results -can be obtained. Thus, the use of different target gene assays is more appropriate for correct detection and identification of circulating influenza viruses than detection of only one gene [31] . The inclusion of highly conserved regions of two different target genes (HA and NA) in the assay described here definitely increases the possibility of detection of a new influenza A strain and significantly decreases the risk that, in the event of a mutation, detection of a specific virus will fail.
