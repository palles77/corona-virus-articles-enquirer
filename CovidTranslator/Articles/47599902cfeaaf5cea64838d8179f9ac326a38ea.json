Evidence from both animals (2) and humans (3) suggests that respiratory viral infections can affect upper respiratory tract bacteria. However, the relevance of experiments in animal models to humans is uncertain, and deductions about causation based on observational studies are difficult. Studies by our group and others have shown that presence and colonization density of commensal bacteria of the nasopharynx (NP) are associated with symptoms of rhinitis and presence of respiratory viruses (4, 5) .",

The vaccine viruses induce broad cell-mediated and local mucosal antibody responses (8) . They replicate well at the lower temperatures of the upper respiratory mucosa but poorly in the lower airways or systemic circulation (9) . LAIV is well tolerated, safe, and effective in preventing culture-and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-proven influenza in children (10, 11) , among whom influenza is a common and sometimes serious infection. However, when compared with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV), higher rates of medically significant wheezing were observed during the second to fourth weeks postvaccination in children 6-23 months of age after the first dose of vaccine (5.9% in LAIV recipients vs. 3.8% in TIV recipients, as shown in Figure 3 in the online supplement in Belshe and colleagues [12] ). In addition, increased all-cause hospitalization in children aged 6-11 months within 180 days of vaccination (6.1% in LAIV recipients vs. 2.6% in TIV recipients) (11) was observed, leading to restriction of licensure to children aged 2 years and older (13, 14) .

For density values, Ct values were converted into gene copies (GC)/ml using standard curves (16) . qPCR assays for adenovirus, bocavirus, influenza (A and B), respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza (types 1-3), parechovirus, coronavirus (229E, OC43, and NL63), and enterovirus were performed using methods described previously (4, 18) .

            "text": "To our knowledge, this study represents the first exploration of the effects of experimental respiratory viral infection on bacterial upper respiratory colonization in humans. We show that infections with attenuated viruses can result in increases in carriage density of common bacteria or increases in acquisition, raising the possibility that WT influenza and other viruses may have more marked such effects. Children carrying more bacteria are probably more infectious than those with fewer, and it makes biological sense that such bacteria should evolve to sense viral rhinitis or the host response to it and exploit it as a transmission opportunity. In addition to proliferating, bacteria might change phenotype to one better suited to successful transit. Our findings also suggest that LAIV could be used as an experimental tool with which to elucidate relationships between nasal bacterial abundance and transmission rates between children. Because the effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines depends on their impact on bacterial transmission both within and beyond the pediatric population, there are good practical reasons why the biology of this process should be elucidated in detail. Does this study raise safety concerns about LAIV? We did not detect any safety signals associated with increased bacterial colonization density, but the study was not powered to do so. Upper respiratory carriage of bacteria is not an illness, and many authors assume it to be asymptomatic (22, 23) . We previously reported an association between carriage of H. influenzae and rhinitis in healthy children (4) , and in the present study we demonstrate an association for S. pneumoniae density independent of detectable viral nucleic acid and age. However, these symptoms are mild, and the vaccine has been studied in clinical trials (10) (11) (12) (13) . In addition, it has been widely used in children aged 2 years and older without any safety signals that one might attribute to higher bacterial density such as otitis media, pneumonia, or bacteremia, and overall the vaccine protects against the former (10). One might expect evolutionary pressures to select for bacteria that exploit the ubiquitous respiratory viral infections of early childhood to promote colonization and transmission while minimizing serious pathology in their hosts.",

However, measurement of colonization rates with this and other bacterial species was not the primary study aim and absolute numbers of carriers constituting the difference were small, so it is possible that this finding may have occurred by chance. If it is a genuine increase in bacterial acquisition induced by the vaccine, it has echoes of the observation of pneumococcal acquisition in ferrets experimentally infected with influenza (2). In a recent adult pneumococcal challenge study, colonization was more likely in the presence of a respiratory virus (24) , although this was not associated with higher carriage density, possibly reflecting differences between adults and children. Confirmatory studies of acquisition of H. influenzae and other bacterial species are needed. A twofold rise in M. catarrhalis density was seen in the comparison of pre-and postvaccine doses but not in the randomized comparison, most likely due to a population average effect (specifically, the big impact of those with very high colonization densities). We also found that colonization at the time of vaccination was associated with greater overall rises in density, suggesting that increases in bacterial load were due not to acquisition of new strains but to proliferation of those already present (data not shown). This could be confirmed in future studies. We also found no effects of number of siblings (Table 3 ) on the observed differences between groups (data not shown). There were too few S. aureus carriers to analyze the effects of the vaccine on density, although we saw rises in density at V3 (28 d) apparently similar to those seen for S. pneumoniae ( Figure E1 ), observations that are concordant with those made in animal models (15) .",

The higher dropout rate in the early vaccine group was evident mostly after the third visit ( Figure 1 ) and thus did not influence the findings of the between-groups analysis (V1-V3). That no placebo was used is a limitation, but an administration device identical to the vaccine could not be obtained. Less than 30% of the available parents consented to participate, which is high for a pediatric vaccine study but raises the possibility of selection bias. We could not collect information on parents who refused or on their children and so cannot exclude this possibility, but we have no reason to believe that our subjects were unrepresentative of the population.",

However, we have recently shown that individuals with discordant PCR and culture results tend to have low density colonization (16) . Although DNA may be present in the absence of living organisms, it nevertheless represents a footprint of recent bacterial presence, which is what this study was designed to measure. Nevertheless, it will be important to perform follow-up confirmatory studies and to elucidate how the bacterial density measurements we report here relate to efficiency of transmission between colonized children.",

As no intermediate samples between 7 and 28 days were taken, nor were any taken more than 28 days after a vaccine dose, the timing of the peak of this effect remains unclear. Because bacteria can divide very rapidly, one can speculate that the time lag that rendered the density rise undetectable at 7 days, by when vaccine viral infection would have been well established, indicates that bacterial proliferation is triggered by the host response rather than by the viruses themselves. It is also possible that the usually asymptomatic infections caused by attenuated cold-adapted vaccine viral strains induce relatively slow, small bacterial responses that were hard to detect at the earlier time point. Future studies should include additional sampling times to clarify the duration of this effect and the timing of its peak.",

Although not associated with disease, these effects may be important at the population level, especially in the context of more virulent WT respiratory virus infections, which may have potent effects on bacterial transmission between individuals. Nearly all childhood vaccination programs rely to an extent on the interruption of transmission of infections, so our findings should encourage further human studies of transmission dynamics. n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.",
