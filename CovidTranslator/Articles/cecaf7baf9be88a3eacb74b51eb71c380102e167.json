This study underlines the importance of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the active component of a viral infection, in inducing the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in human astroglia. DsRNA in the form of synthetic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly IC) induced expression of iNOS and iNOS promoter-driven luciferase activity through activation of nuclear factor (NF)-U UB and CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteinL L (C/EBPL L). In addition, we show that inhibitors of protein kinase R attenuated iNOS by suppressing the activation of NF-U UB but not C/EBPL L. In contrast, knock down of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) attenuated iNOS by suppressing the activation of C/EBPL L but not NF-U UB. This study delineates a novel role of dsRNA in inducing the expression of iNOS through dsRNAactivated protein kinase (PKR)-mediated activation of NF-U UB and p38-mediated activation of C/EBPL L in human astroglia that may participate in virus-induced neurological abnormalities. \u00df 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Biochemical Societies.",

            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, in\u00a3ammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that generally a\u00a5icts persons between the ages of 20 and 50 years. The major pathological hallmark of MS is the presence of sclerotic plaques in the CNS which are characterized by demyelination associated with a broad-spectrum in\u00a3ammatory reaction orchestrated by activated lymphocytes, macrophages, and endogenous glial cells (astroglia and microglia) [1] . Although the etiology of MS remains unknown, epidemiological studies suggest that both environmental and genetic factors play a role [1, 2] . Environmental factor(s), particularly viral infection, has been implicated as one of the potential triggering events leading to demyelination in MS [2, 3] . Demyelination in both humans and rodents can be initiated by infection with a diverse group of viruses. Consistently, both retroviral expression and cytotoxic factor production have been evidenced in MS monocyte/macrophage cultures and MS cerebrospinal \u00a3uid. Furthermore, human coronaviruses (HCoV), which cause common colds, can also infect neural cell cultures [4, 5] . Coronaviruses induce an MS-like disease in rodents, and are neuroinvasive in humans [6, 7] . Consistently, HCoV RNA was detected in MS patient brains [6, 8] and in cerebrospinal \u00a3uid of MS and other neurological disease patients [7] . Coronavirus antigens were also detected in MS patient brains [8] . It is possible that a viral infection acquired during adolescence initiates MS after a long period of quiescence. However, the mechanism by which viral infection leads to neuroin\u00a3ammation and demyelination in MS is poorly understood.",

            "text": "of iNOS in human U373MG astroglial cells and primary astroglia Poly IC, a synthetic dsRNA copolymer of inosinic and cytidylic acids, has been often used as a tool to mimic the e\u00a1ects of dsRNA intermediates produced during viral infection of cells [9] . It is evident from Table 1 that poly IC alone markedly induced the production of NO in U373MG astroglial cells. Since poly IC is made up of two homopolymers of inosinic and cytidylic acids, we examined if each of these polymers could induce NO. In contrast to dsRNA, treatment of U373MG astroglial cells with single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) (either poly I or poly C) resulted in very little induction of NO production (Table 1) suggesting that the presence of RNA with double-stranded structures is required for the induction of NO. Furthermore, these results also suggested that the induction of NO production was not due to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contamination in the RNA preparation, which is a potent inducer of NO production in di\u00a1erent cells. The inhibition of poly IC-induced production of NO by arginase (an enzyme that degrades the substrate, L-arginine, of NOS) and L-NMMA (a competitive inhibitor of NOS) but not by D-NMMA (a negative control of L-NMMA) suggests that poly IC induces the production of NO through NOS-mediated arginine metabolism (Table 1) . To understand the mechanism of induction of NO production, we examined the e\u00a1ect of poly IC on protein and mRNA levels of iNOS. Fig. 1 shows that poly IC dose dependently induced the production of NO (A) and the expression of iNOS protein (B) and mRNA (C). Similarly poly IC also induced iNOS promoter-driven luciferase activity in a dose-dependent fashion, and the maximum induction of about 3.7-fold was observed at 100 or 150 Wg/ml of poly IC (Fig. 1D ). Consistent to the induction of iNOS in U373MG astroglial cells, poly IC also dose dependently in- duced the production of NO (data not shown) and iNOS promoter-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 1E ) in human primary astrocytes.",

Therefore, NF-UB was inhibited by vp65, a dominant-negative mutant of p65, and C/EBPL was inhibited by vC/EBPL [12, 14] .

            "text": "(p38) in poly IC-induced activation of iNOS promoter in U373MG astroglial cells Next we investigated mechanisms by which poly IC couples to NF-UB and C/EBPL for the expression of iNOS. Several studies, e.g. [16] , have shown that PKR plays an important role in biological activities of poly IC. To investigate if PKR is involved in poly IC-induced activation of human iNOS promoter, we inhibited the function of PKR by vPKR. It is evident from Fig. 4A that expression of the vPKR but not the empty vector signi\u00a2cantly inhibited (P 6 0.01) poly IC-induced activation of iNOS promoter. Interestingly, transcriptional activity of NF-UB ( Fig. 4B) but not of C/EBPL (Fig.  4C ) was inhibited by vPKR. Vaccinia viral protein, K3L, inhibits PKR [17] . Similar to vPKR, pMT-K3L also attenuated the transcription of iNOS promoter (Fig. 5A ) by suppressing the activation of NF-UB ( Fig. 5B) but not of C/EBPL (Fig. 5C ). These studies suggest that vPKR inhibits the expression of iNOS by suppressing the activation of NF-UB but not of C/EBPL. Because p38 has been shown to be involved in cytokinemediated expression of iNOS [18] , we investigated the possibility if p38 plays a role in poly IC-mediated expression of iNOS. We used vp38 to inhibit the function of p38. Similar to the e\u00a1ect of vPKR, vp38 also inhibited human iNOS promoter-driven luciferase activity (P 6 0.01) in poly IC-stimulated cells (Fig. 4A) . However, in contrast to vPKR, vp38 inhibited poly IC-induced activation of C/EBPL (Fig. 4C) but not of NF-UB (Fig. 4B) . Consistently, SB203580, a speci\u00a2c inhibitor of p38, also knocked down the activation of iNOS promoter by inhibiting the activation of C/EBPL but not of NF-UB in poly IC-stimulated cells (data not shown). These results suggest that inhibition of p38 attenuates poly IC-induced expression of iNOS by impairing the activation of C/ EBPL but not of NF-UB. Since vPKR and vp38 decreased poly IC-induced activation of iNOS promoter by acting on distinct transcription factors, we examined if these two dom- inant negatives exhibited any additive e\u00a1ect. However, after combining both forms of mutants during transient transfection, we were unable to achieve more than 40% inhibition (data not shown), and the reason behind this lies in the lack of achieving su\u2044cient transfection e\u2044ciency. Earlier, we have shown that during successful transient transfection experiments by Lipofectamine Plus, transfection e\u2044ciency varies from 33 to 44% [19] .",

Although the association of a virus with MS has not been con\u00a2rmed, based on detection of virions, viral nucleic acids, or viral proteins in CNS or the presence of antiviral antibodies in serum and/or cerebrospinal \u00a3uid (CSF), several viruses have been shown to be associated with MS [6^8]. A common viral structure that is almost universally recognized by eukaryotic cells is dsRNA ( s 100 bp). dsRNA is not present during the normal life cycle of eukaryotic cells; however, it is present in virally infected cells. How-ever, the biological function of dsRNA within the CNS is poorly understood. Several lines of evidence presented here clearly support the conclusion that dsRNA is capable of inducing the expression of iNOS in human astroglia. Earlier studies have shown that dsRNA inhibits L-cell function and induces islet damage by stimulating L-cell production of NO [22] . Since the expression of iNOS within the CNS participates in the pathogenesis of MS, our \u00a2ndings could help explain why exacerbations of MS are often associated with a variety of di\u00a1erent viral infections.",

            "text": "DsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), a 68-kDa serinethreonine kinase, plays a primary role in mediating the antiviral activities of infected cells [17] . It has been shown that NF-UB activation in response to dsRNA appears to be dependent on functional PKR and that dsRNA-induced NF-UB activation is attenuated in mouse embryonic \u00a2broblasts isolated from PKR-de\u00a2cient mice [24] . Chu et al. [25] have shown that PKR may mediate dsRNA-induced NF-UB nuclear localization by activating IKK [24] . In addition, a Toll-like receptor (TLR) molecule (TLR3) has been reported to recognize dsRNA and activate NF-UB via PKR [26] . Consistently, we have found that inhibitors of PKR suppress dsRNA-induced activation of NF-UB, and thereby inhibit the activation of iNOS promoter in human astroglial cells. Earlier, Maggi et al. [27] have shown that PKR is required for dsRNA-induced expression of iNOS but not for activation of NF-UB in macrophages. In contrast, Blair et al. [28] have reported that PKR is not required for dsRNA-induced iNOS expression or NF-UB activation by islets. However, our studies have shown that PKR is required for dsRNA-induced expression of iNOS and activation of NF-UB in human astroglial cells. These discrepancies may be explained by the existence of di\u00a1erent regulatory mechanisms in di\u00a1erent cell types. In addition to the activation of NF-UB, dsRNA also induced the activation of C/EBPL that has been also found to be necessary for dsRNA-induced expression of iNOS. However, similar to the inhibition of NF-UB activation, vPKR and pMT-K3L did not inhibit dsRNA-induced activation of C/ EBPL (Figs. 4 and 5) . These studies suggest that PKR is coupled to the transcription of iNOS via activation of NF-UB but not that of C/EBPL.",
