Here we expressed the SARS-CoV S-protein to investigate its interactions with innate immune mechanisms in the lung. The purified S-protein was detected as a 210 kDa glycosylated protein. It was not secreted in the presence of tunicamycin and was detected as a 130 kDa protein in the cell lysate. The purified S-protein bound to Vero but not 293T cells and was itself recognized by lung surfactant protein D (SP-D), a collectin found in the lung alveoli. The binding required Ca 2+ and was inhibited by maltose. The serum collectin, mannan-binding lectin (MBL), exhibited no detectable binding to the purified S-protein. S-protein binds and activates macrophages but not dendritic cells (DCs). It suggests that SARS-CoV interacts with innate immune mechanisms in the lung through its Sprotein and regulates pulmonary inflammation.",

Coronaviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses with genomes of $30 kb in size (Enjuanes et al., 2001) . Sequencing of its genome shows that SARS-CoV expresses the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins Fouchier et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003) . S-proteins are expressed on the surface of CoVs to mediate virus-host cell interactions leading to host cell infection (Cavanagh et al., 1986; Luo et al., 1999; Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001 ). An important property of S-protein is the high degree of glycosylation (Cavanagh, 1995) . Whether and how the carbohydrate structures on S-proteins benefit the virus are unclear. Lectins that recognize microbial carbohydrate structures and target microbes for destruction and clearance (Weis et al., 1998) , form an important arm of host innate immunity and it is possible that the highly glycosylated S-protein is recognized by such lectins.",

Each collectin polypeptide is composed of a middle collagenlike region flanked by an N-terminal cycteine-rich segment and an a-helical neck region that links the C-terminal Ca 2+ -dependent carbohydrate-recognition domain to the collagen-like region (CRD) (Lu et al., 2002; Holmskov et al., 2003) . Three polypeptides form a collagen-like triple helix in the middle of the molecule and the neck region bundles the C-terminal CRDs into clusters of three. These trimeric structures are further assembled through disulfide formation at the N-terminal segments to form the different collectin molecules (Lu et al., 2002; Holmskov et al., 2003) . Thus assembled collectin molecules display clustered CRDs at the periphery which, as shown by electron microscopy, can afford dimensions and flexibility to achieve multivalent binding to sugar residues on microbial pathogens (Voss et al., 1988; Lu et al., 1990 Lu et al., , 1993 Lu et al., , 2002 Holmskov et al., 1995 Holmskov et al., , 2003 . Three collectins are well-characterized in man, i.e. mannan-binding lectin (MBL), surfactant protein A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) (Lawson and Reid, 2000; Crouch and Wright, 2001; Jack et al., 2001) . MBL is found predominantly in the blood circulation whereas SP-A and SP-D are expressed mainly in the lung at the alveolar surface associated with the surfactant monolayer (Lawson and Reid, 2000; Crouch and Wright, 2001; Jack et al., 2001) . SP-A and SP-D are also found in extra-pulmonary tissues (Lu, 1997; Madsen et al., 2000) .",

MBL-deficiency leads to poor complement activation and defective microbial opsonization for phagocytosis during childhood (Super et al., 1989) . MBL \u00c0/\u00c0 mice exhibit higher mortality compared with wild type mice upon Staphylococcus aureus challenge (Shi et al., 2004) . Compared with wild type mice, SP-A \u00c0/\u00c0 mice exhibit decreased killing of B. streptococcus and Haemophilus influenzae, display elevated lung inflammation as well as decreased oxidant production and macrophage phagocytosis (LeVine et al., 2000) . SP-D \u00c0/\u00c0 mice show increased lung inflammation and oxidant production but decreased macrophage phagocytosis (LeVine et al., 2000) . Deficiency in either SP-A or SP-D expression leads to increased inflammation and reduced pathogen uptake by alveolar macrophages. The latter is consistent with that both pulmonary collectins and the serum collectin MBL promote pathogen uptake by macrophages (LeVine et al., 2000; Kudo et al., 2004) . In the present study, we investigated whether the lung collectins are able to recognize the SARS-CoV S-protein.",

At concentrations between 1.5 and 6.25 mM, maltose showed dose-dependent inhibition of SP-D binding to S-protein. Therefore, binding of SP-D to S-protein clearly involves the SP-D CRDs and the carbohydrate structures on Sprotein. Although the purified S-protein contains the SP-D 'neck' sequence and the myc and His tag sequences, there are no potential glycosylation sites on these sequences. The carbohydrate-dependent SP-D binding to S-protein rules out SP-D recognition of these regions. Inhibition by other sugars was also examined. As shown in Fig. 4C , SP-D binding to S-protein was inhibited by mannose as well as maltose. However, it was not significantly inhibited by galactose and GlcNAc.

As for Vero and 293T cells, binding of S-protein to macrophages and DCs was examined by flow cytometry. Firstly, the two cell types were examined for the expression of the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2. Interestingly, ACE2 was detected on macrophages but not on DCs (Fig. 5A) . We then examined S-protein binding to macrophages and DCs. As shown in Fig. 5B , S-protein could bind to macrophages. Although ACE2 was not detected on DCs, S-protein was also shown to bind to DCs with a distinct pattern from macrophages (Fig. 5B ). This could involve other DC receptors (Jeffers et al., 2004; Marzi et al., 2004) . Pre-incubation of S-protein with SP-D did not inhibit S-protein binding to macrophages indicating that the carbohydrate structures on S-protein are probably not involved in the observed S-protein binding to macrophages. SP-D showed no enhancement of S-protein binding to macrophages. SP-D also showed no inhibition or enhancement to S-protein binding to Vero cells (Fig. 3B, right panel) . (1) and Vero (2) cells were washed and then surface biotinylated. The cell lysates were incubated with streptavidin-Sepharose to precipitate biotinylated surface proteins which were subjected to Western blotting using the anti-ACE2 antibody. (B) Vero and 293T cells were detached with 0.5 mM EDTA in PBS, washed and then incubated with purified S-protein. After washing, the cells were incubated with a mouse anti-myc antibody (solid lines). As controls, the cells were not incubated with S-protein but stained with the same antibodies (solid histograms). In another experiment (Vero/SP-D), S-protein was also incubated with human SP-D (dotted line) or, as a control, with BSA (solid line), before incubation with Vero cells and bound S-protein was similarly detected by flow cytometry using the anti-myc antibody. The solid histogram in this experiment represents signals detected on cells that were not incubated with S-protein but stained with the anti-myc antibody.",

Cytokine production by DCs and macrophages, upon S-protein stimulation, was also examined by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 6 , while S-protein was consistently a weaker stimulus than LPS, it induced IL-6, IL-8 as well as TNF-a from macrophages. However, it did not induce significant cytokines from DCs. This is seemingly in contrast with the reported cytokine induction from DCs by live SARS-CoV virus (Law et al., 2005) . However, it should be noted that live SARS-CoV are a more complex stimulus which could activate more complex signaling than S-protein in these cells.

At the air-epithelial interfaces of lung alveoli, a surfactant monolayer is present. A primary function of the surfactant is to reduce surface tension at the end of expiration to prevent the collapse of the lung alveoli (Hawgood and Clements, 1990) . It is also known that the surfactant contains two collectin molecules, i.e. SP-A and SP-D, which recognize carbohydrate structures on a wide range of microbial pathogens leading to killing and clearance of these microbes (Lu et al., 2002; Holmskov et al., 2003) . Coronaviruses infect host cells through the highly glycosylated surface S-proteins. We therefore decided to investigate whether and how the carbohydrate structures on S-protein may interact with these surfactant collectins. To preserve the natural carbohydrate moiety on S-protein, it was expressed in eukaryotic cells. S-protein was expressed without the transmembrane and internal domains to permit its secretion into the medium and allow its purification as a soluble probe. To express S-protein as a trimer, its Cterminus was fused with the 'neck' sequence of SP-D, which is known to form strong triple coiled-coils and to cluster associated structures into parallel trimers. This strategy was initially to reflect the multiplicity of S-protein on the virus but a recent report showed that SARS-CoV S-protein in fact forms trimers naturally (Li et al., 2006) .",

The effective inhibition of SP-D-binding to S-protein by EDTA and sugars such as maltose and mannose suggest that SP-D binds to the carbohydrate moieties on S-protein. We similarly examined whether S-protein was recognized by SP-A, another surfactant-associated collectin. Due to the low level of binding detected, we were unable to conclude whether S-protein is also recognized by SP-A (data not shown). We showed that the serum collectin, MBL, was unable to recognize S-protein. One possible explanation for the apparently selective recognition of S-protein by SP-D may be that S-proteins display sugar residues that are preferentially recognized by SP-D. These two collectins exhibit different sugar specificity. For example, SP-D shows little affinity for GlcNAc to which MBL binds effectively (Lu et al., 1992; Holmskov et al., 2003) . The disparities between SP-D and most other collectins in overall dimensions may also contribute to their differences in carbohydrate recognition. SP-D has long collagen-like helices which enable its CRDs to extend more than 90 nm apart whereas SP-A and MBL have much shorter collagen helices which can only extend their CRDs maximally less than 30 nm apart (Lu, 1997; Holmskov et al., 2003) . C-type lectins, including collectins, mainly recognize specific sugar residues that are terminally presented and non-reducing (Lu et al., 2002; Holmskov et al., 2003) . While such sugar residues are common on extracellular microbial pathogens, viral glycoproteins are synthesized using the host eukaryotic cell machinery and most peripheral sugar residues are expected to be modified by terminal sialic acid residues. Therefore, despite the high degree of glycosylation of S-protein, suitable terminal sugar residues that are recognized by CRDs are probably infrequent and scattered. The much extended dimensions of SP-D, compared with MBL and SP-A, may enable it to bind to these scattered sugar residues more efficiently.",

(B) Macrophages and DCs were incubated with S-protein followed by mouse anti-myc antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG (RPE) (dotted lines). As controls, cells were not incubated with S-protein but were subsequently stained with mouse anti-myc antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG (solid histograms). S-protein was also incubated with SP-D before incubation with the cells (solid lines). (C) DCs and macrophages were stimulated for 6 h with LPS (0.5 mg/ml) or S-protein (20 mg/ml) in the presence of brefeldin A (10 mg/ml). The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and then stained with RPE-labelled mouse anti-TNF-a antibody (solid lines) or, as controls, with isotype mouse IgG (soild histograms).
