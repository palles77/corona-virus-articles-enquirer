No vaccines or licensed therapeutics currently exist to protect humans against NiV or HeV. HNVs enter host cells by fusing the viral and cellular membranes via the concerted action of the attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins, the main targets of the humoral immune response. Here, we describe the isolation and humanization of a potent monoclonal antibody cross-neutralizing NiV and HeV. Cryo-electron microscopy, triggering and fusion studies show the antibody binds to a prefusion-specific quaternary epitope, conserved in NiV F and HeV F glycoproteins, and prevents membrane fusion and viral entry. This work supports the importance of the HNV prefusion F conformation for eliciting a robust immune response and paves the way for using this antibody for prophylaxis and post-exposure therapy with NiV-and HeV-infected individuals.",

They cause severe encephalitis and respiratory illness, with fatality rates of 50-100%, and are classified as biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) select agents 1 . Unlike several other paramyxoviruses, HNVs have a broad species tropism (as is the case for canine distemper virus 2 ) and can infect animals from at least six mammalian orders 1 . Pteropid fruit bats (flying foxes) appear to be the predominant natural reservoir hosts of HNVs 3 . Since the first outbreaks of HeV in Australia in 1994 and of NiV in Malaysia in 1998, HeV repeatedly infected horses in Australia with resultant human exposures 4 , while food-borne mediated NiV spillovers have occurred nearly every year in Bangladesh 5 . Furthermore, NiV outbreaks have occurred in the Philippines and in India 6 . Besides Asia and Oceania, the detection of anti-HNV antibodies in humans and Pteropus bats in Africa, a continent in which no documented NiV or HeV outbreaks have occurred, further suggests that future HNV zoonotic emergence is likely to happen 7 . Although more than two billion people live in regions threatened by potential HNV outbreaks, there are no clinically approved vaccines or specific therapeutics against these pathogens.",

            "text": "Paramyxoviruses deliver their genome to the host cytoplasm by fusing their lipid envelope with the cellular membrane to initiate infection. This process requires the concerted action of two surface glycoproteins, attachment (G/H/HN) and fusion (F), which sets the paramyxovirus entry machinery apart from all other class I fusion proteins. G is a type II homotetrameric transmembrane protein with an ectodomain comprising a stalk and a C-terminal \u03b2-propeller head, and the latter domain is responsible for binding to ephrinB2 or ephrinB3 (ephrinB2/B3) receptors [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . F is a homotrimeric type I transmembrane protein that is synthesized as a premature F 0 precursor and cleaved by cathepsin L during endocytic recycling to yield the mature, disulfide-linked, F 1 and F 2 subunits [13] [14] [15] . Viral fusion proteins are believed to exist in a kinetically trapped metastable conformation at the virus surface 16 . Upon binding to ephrinB2/B3, NiV G has been proposed to undergo conformational changes leading to F triggering and insertion of the F hydrophobic fusion peptide into the target membrane 8, 17, 18 . Subsequent refolding into the more stable postfusion F conformation drives merger of the viral and host membranes to form a pore for genome delivery to the cell cytoplasm, as shown for other paramyxoviruses and pneumoviruses 13,19-24 . Paramyxovirus G/H/HN and F glycoproteins are the main targets of the humoral immune response and neutralizing antibodies are the key vaccine-induced protective mechanism against measles virus, for example 25 . Among the few well-characterized anti-HNV G neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), m102.4 was previously isolated from a na\u00efve human phage display library and shown to neutralize all known strains of NiV and HeV [26] [27] [28] . Moreover, m102.4 protected ferrets and African green monkeys from HeV/NiV lethal challenges when administered up to several days post infection [29] [30] [31] [32] . Anti-F mouse polyclonal antibodies and hybridoma-secreted mAbs were shown to protect hamsters from NiV and HeV challenge [33] [34] [35] . We further demonstrated that immunization of mice with prefusion NiV F or HeV F led to strong homotypic serum neutralization titers, with lower heterotypic titers, whereas postfusion F failed to elicit a robust neutralizing response 17 . So far, no information is available about the epitopes recognized by HNV F mAbs and their potential for use as therapeutics in humans or to guide reverse vaccinology initiatives.",

Neutralization assays, carried out under BSL-4 containment, showed that 5B3 and h5B3.1 potently inhibited NiV and HeV infection of target cells. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the NiV F trimer in complex with 5B3 and found the antibody binds to a prefusionspecific quaternary epitope that is conserved in NiV F and HeV F. Our structural data, combined with F-triggering and membrane fusion assays, demonstrate that 5B3 locks F in the prefusion conformation and prevents membrane fusion via molecular stapling, providing a molecular rationale for its potency. These results define a critical neutralization epitope on the surface of the NiV and HeV F glycoproteins and pave the way for the future use of h5B3.1 for prophylaxis or as therapeutic for NiV-and HeV-infected individuals.",

The resulting antibody was subsequently humanized (and designated h5B3.1) to enable future therapeutic use in humans. We used biolayer interferometry to characterize the binding kinetics and affinity of the 5B3 and h5B3.1 Fab fragments to prefusion NiV F and HeV F ectodomain trimers immobilized on the surface of biosensors. The 5B3 Fab bound to HeV F/NiV F with equilibrium dissociation constants of 4.6-10 nM, compared to equilibrium dissociation constants of 31-61 nM for interactions with the h5B3.1 Fab (Fig. 1a -d and Supplementary Table 1 ). Analysis of the determined association and dissociation rate constants indicate that the weaker binding affinity of h5B3.1, compared to 5B3, largely resulted from an enhanced dissociation rate of h5B3.1 (Supplementary Table 1) .",

The final model includes NiV F residues 27-480 with a chain break between residues 105 and 112. 5B3 binds to a quaternary epitope on domain III of the NiV F globular head, with a stoichiometry of three Fabs bound to an F trimer (Fig. 2a,b , Table 1 and Extended Data 1 and 2).",

CDRL1 contacts the NiV F heptad-repeat A (HRA) \u03b2-hairpin via electrostatic interactions between Gln27 5B3 and Lys160 F , Gln162 F and Thr168 F (Fig. 3a -c, Extended Data 2).

CDRH2 protrudes at the interface between two NiV F protomers and interacts with a segment C-terminal to the central helix and with the upstream helix of a neighboring protomer (Fig. 3a -c and Extended Data 2). Comparison with the unliganded NiV F structure reveals that 5B3 binding induces a local reorganization (or stabilizes a different conformation) of the HRA \u03b2-hairpin (residues 160-170) and of residues 248-252 (Extended Data 3).",

This, in part, results from the fact that CDRL1 is making a greater contribution to the paratope than the nine residue-long CDRH3 (268 \u00c5 2 versus 190 \u00c5 2 of buried surface area, respectively), in contrast with the canonical CDRH3-dominated antibody/antigen interfaces. To confirm these findings, we probed the NiV F binding ability of single-chain (scFv) chimeric constructs in which either the variable heavy (VH) or variable light (VL) h5B3 chains were replaced with an unrelated chain from a human scFv library. Although h5B3 scFv immunoprecipitated full-length NiV F, none of the scFv chimeras did, in agreement with the equivalent contributions to binding of the heavy and light chains observed in our structure (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data 4a). The structural data were further validated using site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues participating in the NiV F epitope followed by 5B3-mediated immunoprecipitation to assess residual binding (Extended Data 4b). We also used the prefusion F specific 12B2 antibody as well as a cell-cell fusion assay to probe the conformational integrity of the F mutants analyzed (Extended Data 4b,c). The NiV F K55A substitution inhibited 5B3 recognition, which is probably explained by the loss of interactions with CDRL1 Trp32 5B3 and CDRL3 Tyr92 5B3 residues, as visualized in our structure. Furthermore, abrogation of 5B3 binding to NiV F L53D or L53S probably resulted from reduction of favorable interactions with CDRL1 Trp32 5B3 , CDRL3 Phe91 5B3 and CRH3 Tyr102 5B3 . Given that the tested mutants bound to the12B2 antibody and retained 40-100% of the wild-type F fusion activity (Extended Data 4b,c), we conclude that the observed loss of binding largely resulted from specific disruption of interactions with 5B3, without major effects on the overall F structure.",

To assess the possibility of generating 5B3 neutralization-escape virus mutants, such as the aforementioned bindingdeficient F mutants identified by site-directed mutagenesis, we passaged authentic NiV for three rounds in the presence of 5B3 in BSL-4 containment. Plaque purified resistant viruses were isolated, and viral RNA from five NiV isolates was reverse-transcribed into cDNA for sequencing of the F gene. All five NiV escape mutants harbored the same F K55E substitution. This finding supports our aforementioned mutagenesis data because the NiV F K55A was completely defective in 5B3 binding. We recombinantly produced the K55E F mutant and observed it could not bind 5B3 while maintaining its ability to interact with 12B2 and to promote wild-type cell-cell fusion activity (Extended Data 4b,c). These experiments are in full agreement with our structural and biochemical data and show that NiV could escape 5B3 neutralization without affecting F-mediated fusion, although the impact of the identified substitution on viral growth is not known.",

Furthermore, when the triggering assay was carried out in the presence of a biotinylated HRB peptide, a conformational intermediate of the fusion reaction was captured and could be used as a reporter of F activation. Using this approach, we demonstrate here that addition of 5B3 or h5B3.1 during the triggering assay blocked fusogenic conformational changes in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas a nonneutralizing control antibody (13G5), specific for postfusion F, did not ( Fig. 4c,d) . Subsequent antibody affinity purification (protein G) of the material not captured by the HRB peptide showed 5B3 (or h5B3.1) remained bound to F (Fig. 4d) , supporting the hypothesis that 5B3/h5B3.1 trap NiV F in the prefusion conformation. Finally, capture of an F intermediate could be partially rescued by raising the temperature to \u226560 \u00b0C, indicating that binding of 5B3/h5B3.1 stabilizes NiV F by raising the energy barrier for transitioning to the postfusion state (Fig. 4e ). In summary, the structural and biochemical data presented here show 5B3/h5B3.1 inhibited fusogenic conformational changes by locking F in the prefusion state and raising the free energy of activation for fusion triggering.",

This mechanism of action rationalizes the potent 5B3/h5B3.1-mediated neutralization of NiV and HeV entry into target cells and is reminiscent of D25 inhibition of RSV via binding to and stabilization of prefusion F 22 . These findings are also in line with the enhanced properties of RSV and parainfluenza virus prefusion-stabilized F glycoproteins as candidate vaccine immunogens compared to the corresponding postfusion F 41,43,48 . Accordingly, the previously developed disulfide-stabilized prefusion HeV F 42 , and the corresponding prefusion NiV F construct engineered here, bear the promise of eliciting stronger neutralizing antibody titers than GCN4-only stabilized F glycoprotein ectodomains, by preventing refolding to the postfusion conformation.

So far, m102.4 is the only human mAb that has been used for HNV protection studies in ferrets and African green monkeys [29] [30] [31] . Murine antibodies have limited clinical use due to their short serum half-life, inability to trigger human effector functions and the risk of mounting an anti-mouse antibody response. We successfully engineered a humanized version of 5B3 (termed h5B3.1), which retained comparable breadth and potency to the parental mouse mAb and inhibited F-mediated membrane fusion. Therefore, similar to the anti-HNV G m102.4 neutralizing mAb, h5B3.1 could potentially be used for prophylaxis or for post-exposure therapy with individuals exposed to NiV or HeV. Between 2010 and 2017, m102.4 was used on a compassionate basis to treat individuals with significant HeV or NiV exposure risk in Australia, the USA and India (https://www. who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/nipah/en/). These individuals showed no evidence of infection or known health complications after administration of the mAb. The fact that m102.4 was used in humans despite the lack of clinical trials or approval by the FDA (or equivalent agencies) emphasizes the urgent need for developing therapeutics and other counter-measures against highly pathogenic HNVs that have fatality rates of 50-100%.",

We postulate that similar outcomes could be expected with comparably high doses of 5B3/h5B3.1 mAbs.

To engineer a humanized version of 5B3, a human scFv library was first generated based on FR1 and FR4 sequence similarity with 5B3. We adapted previously described methods and PCR primers employed for the generation of naive human scFv library constructed from peripheral blood B cells of several healthy donors 56 by using only the VH subfamily III and \u03ba VL subfamily I primers. VH and VL were first amplified separately from the IgM cDNA library. For VH, we used forward and reverse primers probing the FR1 and FR4 of VH III with restriction site SfiI added to the 5\u2032 end of the forward primer and (G 4 S) 3 linker sequence added to the 3\u2032 end of the reverse primer. For VL, we used forward and reverse primers probing the FR1 and FR4 of VL\u03ba I with (G 4 S) 3 linker sequence added to the 5\u2032 end of the forward primer and restriction site SfiI added to the 3\u2032 end of the reverse primer. The scFv library was assembled by overlapping PCR combining the VH and VL PCR products as template and using the VH III FR1 SfiI forward and VL\u03ba I FR4 SfiI reverse primers. The amplified scFv was then cloned into a pCom3X vector harboring a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag. Colonies from the scFv library were grown and expressed as previously described 57 . We selected the 12 best expressing clones for DNA sequencing based on Coomassie blue staining and western blot analysis using an anti-histidine tag antibody. The translated human scFv FR sequences were then aligned against that of 5B3. For humanization of 5B3, conserved human residues from the alignment were identified and replaced into the homologous positions of 5B3 to generate h5B3. To further humanize h5B3, a version named h5B3.1 was generated from h5B3 where one residue on each of the CDR1 and CDR2 and two residues on CDR3 were mutated into conserved human residues based on the sequences from the human scFv library mentioned above.",

Fusion between NiV F and G glycoprotein-expressing effector cells and permissive target cells was measured using a previously described \u03b2-galactosidase assay 89 . Briefly, plasmids encoding S-peptide tagged wild-type NiV F or each mutant of F and NiV G or no DNA (control/mock transfection) were transfected into HeLa-USU effector cells using lipofectamine LTX with Plus reagent (Thermo-Fischer Scientific). The following day, transfected cells were infected with vaccinia virus-encoding T7 RNA polymerase. HeLa-ATCC cells served as receptor-positive target cells and were also infected with the E. coli Lac Z-encoding reporter vaccinia virus. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C overnight. Cell fusion reactions were conducted by incubating the target and effector cell mixtures at a ratio of 1:1 (2 \u00d7 10 5 total cells per well; 0.2 ml total volume) in 96-well plates at 37 \u00b0C. Cytosine arabinoside (40 \u00b5g ml \u22121 , Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the fusion reaction mixture to reduce non-specific \u03b2-galactosidase production. Nonidet P40 (EMD Millipore Sigma) was added (0.5% final concentration) at 2.5 or 3.0 h, and aliquots of the lysates were assayed for \u03b2-galactosidase at ambient temperature with the substrate chlorophenol red-d-galactopyranoside (Roche). Assays were performed in triplicate, and fusion results were calculated and expressed as rates of \u03b2-Gal activity (change in optical density at 570 nm min \u22121 \u00d7 1,000) in a VersaMAX microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Equal amounts of leftover F/G-expressing effector cells from each fusion reaction were lysed and clarified by centrifugation. The lysates were then subjected to S-protein agarose precipitation followed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting to evaluate the expression level of each F mutant as compared to wild type. The individual cell fusion reactions mediated by each mutant were converted to percentages of wild-type fusion activity and normalized with the total expression of F and each F mutant as measured by densitometry from the images of western blot bands using ImageQuantTL software (GE Healthcare Biosciences). Normalization of each F mutant percentage of wild-type fusion was calculated with the formula: normalized percentage of wild-type fusion = (100/percentage of wild-type expression) \u00d7 percentage of wild-type fusion.",

Neutralization potency was calculated based on p.f.u. for each virus in the well without antibody.

VH 5B3 /VL 5B3 scFv was used as a positive control. Western blotting was carried out using an anti-F polyclonal antibody to detect NiV F or anti-S-peptide antibody to detect the scFv. b, Site-directed mutagenesis of the 5B3 epitope. A panel of S-peptide tagged NiV F ectdomain mutants were generated and expressed in HEK 293T cells. The F-expressing cell lysates were divided equally and incubated with 5B3, 12B2 or S-protein agarose before immunoprecipitation/pulldown. Samples in which mAb 5B3 or 12B2 were added were precipitated with protein G Sepharose. Western blotting detection of the precipitated products was carried out using an anti-S-peptide antibody. The Gly247Ala substitution was used as positive control. c, Cell-cell fusion mediated by the NiV F mutants shown in b. Data are the mean percentage of wild-type fusion levels for each mutant normalized relative to total F expression, as measured by densitometry of western blot bands. The bars represent the standard error from three separate experiments.",
