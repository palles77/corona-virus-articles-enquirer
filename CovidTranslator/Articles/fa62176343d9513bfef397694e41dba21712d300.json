Concurrent infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) did not affect the responses to dietary antigens at weaning, nor did it affect the subsequent development of tolerance. However, TGEV infection did enhance the primary immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG1, but not IgG2, antibody responses to injected soy in comparison to those of uninfected animals. Paradoxically, TGEV-infected animals showed an enhanced primary IgG1 antibody response to injected soy at 4 weeks of age, but they subsequently showed a reduced secondary response after an intraperitoneal challenge at 9 weeks of age in comparison to uninfected animals. The results suggest that an enteric virus, either used as a vaccine vector or present as a subclinical infection, may not have significant effects on the development of dietary allergies but may have effects both on the primary response and on the subsequent recall response to systemic antigens to which the animal is exposed concurrently with virus antigens. on March 24, 2020 by guest http://cvi.asm.org/ Downloaded from FIG. 5.

            "text": "In all individuals, small quantities of dietary proteins are absorbed intact across the intestinal mucosa (17, 29) . Under normal circumstances, these absorbed proteins trigger immunological tolerance (so-called oral tolerance) rather than active immune responses (7, 8) . The inappropriate induction of active immune responses to dietary antigens has been associated with food allergy, intolerance, and intestinal inflammation (4) . The incidence of such allergic diseases appears to be increasing in the human infant population (5, 9, 28, 30) . Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for the development of allergy in some individuals and for this increasing incidence. One possibility is that a viral infection occurring concomitantly with the induction phase of an immune response to a novel dietary antigen may result in the generation of a persistent allergy as a \"bystander\" effect (14, 24) . In addition, viral infections have been implicated in the onset of other inappropriate responses, such as autoimmunity (19) . Alternatively, there is increasing evidence that early life exposure to commensal and pathogenic organisms may protect humans against subsequent allergic disease (11, 21, 27) .",

The first increases in IgG1 and IgG2 antibody were not yet apparent at day 33, which was 6 days postweaning, but we observed a large increase on day 40, or 13 days postweaning. At this point, the level of IgG1 anti-ovalbumin antibody had increased approximately 100-fold over preweaning levels. It increased further to a maximum of approximately 1,000-fold and remained elevated, even after the dietary protein source was changed to fish on day 54, until day 68, although it subsequently decreased slightly by day 84.

A comparison with the level of the reference hyperimmune serum, which had been assigned an arbitrary antibody level of 1,000 (log 3), showed that the mean IgG1 and IgM responses to the diet were about 10% of the levels in hyperimmune serum and the IgG2 response was about 1%. Similarly, weaning onto a diet containing soy resulted in antibody levels that were higher than those in the preweaning period and those for groups 3 and 4, which were not exposed to soy: there was an approximately twofold increase in both serum IgG1 and IgG2 antisoy antibody between days 27 and 40 (Fig. 2) . As was the case for anti-ovalbumin antibody, antisoy IgM increased both in animals fed soy and in animals fed eggs (Fig. 2) . The time course of the response to dietary soy was more rapid than the response to the egg-based diet and was already apparent at 6 days postweaning. A comparison with antibody levels found in the hyperimmune reference serum (log 3) showed that the responses to dietary soy were considerably lower, especially for IgG2.

Concurrently infected piglets developed transiently enhanced primary IgM and persistently enhanced IgG1 antisoy antibody responses. Paradoxically, these same piglets developed lower antibody responses upon a secondary challenge by i.p. injection than did the uninfected group. Three possibilities may account for this observation. First, the initial primary response in the presence of TGEV may have resulted in the preferential differentiation of high levels of effector cells (plasma cells and effector T cells) rather than the differentiation of memory T and B cells. Second, the response to the challenge may have been limited by the level of preexisting antibody; thus, the presence of more antibody in the infected piglets after primary immunization may have inhibited the secondary response (12, 15) . Third, the secondary response may be limited to an absolute maximum: this might be suggested by the observation that final antibody levels in both groups were similar at the end of the experiments. Therefore, the results suggest that a concomitant viral infection or the use of a viral vector to generate mucosal responses may act as a nonspecific adjuvant and enhance primary responses to systemic bystander antigens. Further, our results suggest that delayed effects on immune responses may also occur, as we observed a tendency towards lower total IgG1 levels in the later phase of the experimental period for infected animals. However, an interpretation of the mechanisms of these effects requires further investigation.",

            "text": "In addition to highlighting the impact of a TGEV infection at the point of weaning, this experiment revealed several other interesting effects. First, the decrease in IgG2 antisoy antibody after weaning for the group weaned onto an egg diet and not immunized and in total IgG2 for all groups suggests the decay of maternally derived (either via colostrum or milk) antisoy antibody. The more rapid kinetics of the response to fed soy than to fed ovalbumin may also suggest that the transfer of an antigen capable of priming the neonatal immune system had occurred before contact with a homologous antigen in the novel diet (25) . Second, there was a difference in the ability of prior feeding to cause tolerance of IgG1 and IgG2 antibody on March 24, 2020 by guest http://cvi.asm.org/ responses after immunization. This effect could be attributable to a difference in Th1 or Th2 dependence of the two isotypes: several previous studies in mice have demonstrated an easier induction of Th1 tolerance by feeding (13) . However, the Th dependence of IgG isotypes has not been demonstrated with pigs. Equally possible is the notion that IgG2 antibody responses to systemic challenge may be more variable between animals. The two observations together might suggest that initial IgG1 and IgG2 responses occur to antigens fed to piglets at weaning but that the ability to produce diet-specific IgG1 antibody is subsequently downregulated as the pigs become tolerant, with the result that, as adults, IgG2 antibody to dietary antigen is the predominant isotype which is transferred to the next generation of piglets. This implies that the consequences of early life exposure to dietary antigens are extremely long lived and may affect the immune response of the next generation. The long-term persistence of maternally derived antibodies to dietary soy for over two generations has been observed for other species (16) . The question of the effect of transfer of different levels of antifood antibody of different isotypes on the subsequent immune response of the offspring needs to be addressed. Future work could address this by using ovalbumin as a tolerogenic diet with or without the administration of antibody and/or antigen at weaning to investigate the effect of maternally derived antibody and/or antigen. In addition, a study using infection with a more virulent virus would also be interesting.",
