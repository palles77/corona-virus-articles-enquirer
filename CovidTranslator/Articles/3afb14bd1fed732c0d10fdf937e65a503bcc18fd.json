Therefore, it has been perplexing and enigmatic to witness the growing homeless population sleeping outside in public areas in recent years. Public actions have been called for to deal with the problem. However, the approach of these public actions has depended on how the problem of homelessness has been defined. This paper presents a historical context of how homelessness has been presented in policy discourses. Further, on the basis of a survey conducted in 2004, this paper describes the profile of the homeless and discusses why the homeless began sleeping on the streets.

            "text": "Since 1965, Taiwan has maintained strong and rapid economic growth, which successfully transformed Taiwan from an agricultural society into an industrialized country. Taiwan became one of the fast-growing ''four tigers\" in the East Asia area (Dahlman & Sanaikone, 1997) . Because of the economic success of the past few decades, the citizens enjoy higher household incomes and asset values than in the past. According to the Construction and Planning Agency (2006) , the percentage of owned houses in Taiwan was 83.9% at the end of 2005, which was ranked as one of the highest in the world. However, at the same time, people in urban areas witnessed a growing homeless population wandering around and sleeping outdoors in some public areas. In contrast to the higher home-ownership rate, the phenomenon of homelessness is perplexing and enigmatic for the policy makers and the public to comprehend. Why do some people not share the economic success as other fellow citizens do? What does living on the street look like in practice? What kinds of factors account for people sleeping in the streets? The answers are important in taking down the problem in terms of the government adopting effective policy measures. This paper first presents a historical context of how homelessness has been presented in policy discourse. Then, based on a 2004 survey, the paper describes the profile of the homeless and discusses the reasons why they sleep in the streets in the first place. Lastly, an outreach worker tells his story about working with the homeless in Taipei City, the capital of Taiwan. Policy implications are discussed in terms of premises and appropriate public actions to be taken in response to the homelessness problem in Taiwan.",

            "text": "Historically, the earliest homeless could be traced back to the new immigrants from Mainland China during the Ching Dynasty (Chen, 1995; Lin, 1995) . At that time, the Restriction Sea Order was issued to allow only single males from specific coastal provinces of China to migrate to Taiwan with no family coming along. Many immigrants who lost their jobs in the new world soon became ''liou min\" (gangsters) and ''luo han jiao\" (vagabonds) due to lack of a safety net supported by families. They often engaged in illegal activities, such as robbery, armed conflicts, and murders to make ends meet. During the Japanese colonial time, the homeless were referred as ''beggars\" or ''vagrants\" who panhandled haphazardly and compellingly to ordinary people in the streets. The deviant behaviors they engaged in were considered a threat to the social order, in terms of public safety and work ethic. Therefore, homelessness was regarded as a legal issue in both of these epochs. Public actions in response to the problem then placed emphasis on the role of an enforcement system to adopt punitive arrests and involuntary shelter placement (Chen, 1995; Lin, 1995) .",

It was obvious that the government was reluctant to invest any public resources in the homeless issue at that time. In 1968, the first law, the Ordinance Against Homelessness, was passed to define homelessness and regulate the measures taken. In the Ordinance, the homeless were defined as ''illegal residents with no identity documents, persons without any proper jobs, street children, or persons loitering and sleeping in the public areas.\" Base on the Ordinance, the police could arrest anyone who fit the definition and imprison them into the semi-detention form of homeless shelters (Fang, 2001) .",

The homeless were described as miserable and unfortunate individuals who were cast out by the economic downturn of the time. Sleeping in the streets was portrayed as inhumane and unjust, so that effective public actions were called for. The favorable discourse on the issue of homelessness was reinforced in consonance with the high tide of the social welfare movement in Taiwan at that time. The Taipei City Government, therefore, first nominated the Task Force on Homelessness to investigate the living conditions of the homeless and discuss appropriate public actions. In 1991, the Social Affairs Bureau was officially assigned as the main unit to provide the needed welfare services to the homeless. By then, homelessness was no longer considered a threat to social order, but a problem of the destitute in need of social care (Chen, 1995; Fang, 2001; Lin, 1995) . In 1994, the Central Government issued the Ordinance for Helping the Homeless. 1 The homeless were defined as ''sleeping on the streets or in any public area, beggars, the physically and mentally disabled, and loitering persons.\" According to the Ordinance, the Bureau should provide appropriate services for the homeless in need, whether transferred by the police or reported by anyone, such as food, bathing facilities, shelter, counseling, jobs, etc. (Xu, 1996) .",

Moreover, in contrast to other welfare users, the homeless were marginalized as lesser welfare clients due to the government's lengthy ignorance of the homeless social group and the absence of a rental housing policy. The Bureau took a passive approach to homelessness by simply notifying or reporting them to the proper authorities. The main strategy for handling the homeless was either to place them in institutional care or send them back home to their families (Fang, 2001) . As a result, the annual count of the homeless handled by the government has been between 2000 and 4000 since 2001 (Ministry of the Interior, 2008). Compared with the total population of 23 million in Taiwan, the number of homeless was relatively small to be noticed. In one survey, Lin (1995) suggested that the number of homeless in Taiwan was 14,072. He arrived at this number by averaging the estimated numbers from government officials, scholars and experts, media and journalists, legislators, and staff of welfare institutions. Obviously, there is a huge gap between the official figure and the estimated one, which might limit the government in allocating welfare resources to the issue.",

According to the in-depth interviews, the housing status of an individual changing from the housed to the homeless was not instantaneous, but an incremental shift. In my observation, becoming homeless was often the result of a series of adverse life events. At first, most of them experienced job insecurity or went through business bankruptcy; some suffered from mental illness and exhausted the care of their relatives; some underwent family disruption and were isolated from their family. Then they found themselves in precarious living situation, for example, staying with friends or relatives temporarily, unable to pay rent, constant moving, and, finally, they had no other option but sleeping in the streets. Once an individual had lived on the streets for a certain amount of time, together with an irregular and unhealthy 1 Instead of applying for aid through the Social Assistance Act, which provided regular assistance to the poor, the homeless could use only the temporary resources provided through the Ordinance for Helping the Homeless.

Due to widespread bathing facilities supported by the government or charity organizations, the respondents often use public bathing facilities (47.1%) or public toilets (46%) for personal hygiene purposes. Therefore, setting up more of these bathing facilities would be significant and helpful in changing the stereotypes of the homeless.",

A list of choices was presented to the respondents for selection, as indicated in Table 1 . More than three-quarters (77.4%) of the respondents said longterm unemployment was the primary reason for their becoming homeless; 43.5% thought that being unable to pay for the rent of accommodations was the reason; the other initiators were so-called personal (39.7%) and family (31.5%) factors. This scenario seems to correspond with the high unemployment rate for the past decade in Taiwan because of the macro economic downturn trend in recent years. In addition, the survey also asked public workers handling homelessness affairs in 25 counties to choose the factors that they perceive as leading to homelessness. After weighting the importance of the listed choices (see Table 1 ), they all agreed that ''family dysfunction\" (100%) was the primary factor causing people becoming homeless, followed by the item of ''not working hard\" (82.6%), and then the structural factor of so-called ''difficult job switching and searching\" (78.3%). Only a few workers selected the item ''unable to pay rent\" (i.e. expensive rent or housing price), which was listed as the main reason for the growth of the homeless population in the United States (Anderson & Christian, 2003; Daly, 1996; Jencks, 1994) . The results indicated an obvious gap in the attributed factors of initiating homelessness between the homeless and the public workers. Since the perceptions of what causes homelessness are relevant in formulating policies (Gaubatz, 2001; Neale, 1995) , the individualistic approach taken by the public workers in Taiwan might explain the marginalized and limited nature of public actions in response to the problem.",

It was not easy to assist the homeless, linking them to the services or aids for the needy at that time. I had to explore diversified services and develop new skills to assist them. For example, in October 2003, I created a leaflet with information on the possible harmful risks of living in the streets so the homeless would know. In 1998, in response to public complaints, the Bureau of Social Affairs was determined to solve the homelessness problem and created the Homeless Work and Living Rebuilding Project. With the project funds, I was able to use the money to pay for the homeless to go home, maintain a minimum standard of living, rent temporary houses, find work, etc. So, the senior homeless could have temporary rental houses in which to live. I could then create some temporary job opportunities for them to work based on their old work skills, for example, painting, woodworking, English translation, hair cutting, etc. Once their residence stabilized, I then linked them to long-term welfare subsidies for a sustainable living, so they could eventually depart from street living. For those able-bodied homeless, my main task was to link them to public assistance and employment aids. I would refer them to the Job Search Station run by the Labor Department of the Taipei City Government to match them with appropriate jobs. During job searching, I could use the project's funds to pay for their transportation and meals. However, given the lower education level and lack of job skills, they could only find low-paying jobs, such as cleaners or security guards. Even so, the homeless could not retain these jobs for long due to unstable residence.",

Every citizen in Taiwan must have a household location registered with the government; this is the ''Household Register.\" In an agricultural society, such as Taipei in the early days, people were not mobile as often as they are nowadays. The household location was the same as the address of the residing home. When society industrialized, many people migrated to the city for better jobs and salary. Due to the consideration for property rights, they maintained the household register in their original places, although they resided in other places for work. However, government policies, such as voting, taxation, social welfare and service provision, were all based on the citizens' household registers, instead of their residing addresses. Most homeless people I worked with had been detached from their original household register for a long time and lost their identities. Thus, they were often denied or rejected for the welfare benefits they needed due to the absent household register. Therefore, I would spend quite a lot of my working time reinstating their household registers for them to be entitled to welfare benefits from the city. Usually, I would assist them to find rental places first. I would persuade landlords to allow the homeless to register a household's location as the current address. Once registered, I could then link them to the public assistance for the needy and social services from the city.",

Also, in 2008, the Bureau of Social Affairs of the Taipei City Government planned to renovate an abandoned public house into an emergency shelter for the homeless. Community residents heard about the project before the official announcement. They organized large-scale protests against the project in a very short period of time.

I also hired a homeless person who was once a hair stylist to give haircuts to those who were bathing. This altruistic act did enhance the stylist's self-confidence and reduce the antipathy among the homeless. Moreover, I used the project's funds to pay some elderly homeless people to sweep streets and parks for the community. This service action had two intentions. The first was to encourage them to work regularly. The second was to portray an altruistic impression of the homeless as serving the community, in hopes that the community residents could foster a more favorable attitude toward the homeless and the tension between them could be softened. Furthermore, I organized a puppet show group consisting of only the homeless to encourage them to voicing their experiences to the community. The group members participated in puppeteer training and story workshops to compose the show.

The program aims at providing news and information about street life, providing a platform for the homeless to express their opinions, and inviting the public to know more about the homeless, their experience living on the street, and their difficulties in society (see Fig. 4 ). Each time, I invited a homeless person to host the show so they could connect with the public and speak up for their own rights. The Friendship Methodist Church also plays an active role in providing the homeless opportunities to ''join\" society and participate in some activities for disadvantaged groups. These programs and activities have also obtained some positive feedback and recognition from the public. Therefore, it is certain that the public and society are more willing now to include the homeless and them opportunities. Yet, I sincerely hope that some day in the future, the whole society will have a more open heart to people who sleep in the streets! In my opinion, no one wants to be homeless. There must be some reason that makes someone eventually lead this kind of life. The reason is sometimes expected, sometimes unexpected; sometimes they become homeless by choice, sometimes it is out of their own control. They are the deepest poor in a society with no one to seek help from. From my many years of working with the homeless, I know that if given the chances and resources, they would try their best to make a change in their lives. However, we live in a divided society. Most people do not know the homeless well and hold an unfriendly and stigmatized position against them. For example, for a long time, the community had rejected the establishment of any homeless service centers or rental houses. This is something difficult that I still need to fight in the future. Taiwan is a democratic society that values their people's self-determination to become anybody they like. We cannot stop people from becoming homeless and we cannot make them disappear in the city without their willful consent. However, we, the social workers and agencies, can work together to provide job opportunities, resources for the needy, and supportive relationships by including them in the society as a first step. I hope that someday my neighbors will no longer exclude the homeless and develop a reciprocal relationship with them. I think I should be more patient for the day of coming peace.",

In-depth interviews indicated that the homeless are not a homogeneous social group, but are going through a similar trajectory of street life. Face-to-face questionnaire interviews provided information about what living on the streets looks like, what kinds of difficulties the homeless experience, and what factors initiated their homelessness in the first place. However, the most troublesome finding in this survey was the inconsistent perceptions about what initiates sleeping in the street between the homeless and public workers. According to Gaubatz (2001) and Neale (1995) , the service providers' attribution model for the causes of homelessness would have an impact on policy formulation and program design. If a more individualistic approach to the problem is taken, the workers tend to adopt the attitude of ''victim-blaming\" to intervene in the problems of the homeless for whom they work. They also tend to take a strict, limited, and punitive approach to handling the problems of the homeless. This is why the official number of homeless according to the government was only 3000 persons, while a survey in 1994 indicated a higher number when actually counting the homeless. It is clear that passive measures did not help the long-term homeless depart from street living.",

The battle to tackle the problem is still going on in the two countries, but their valuable experiences and knowledge are worthy of study. Although the two countries have shared no common welfare ideology or policy values, they both added a common element of providing housing to the homeless in formulating their homelessness policies (O'Connell, 2003) . The United Kingdom has emphasized placing the homeless in social housing projects before providing social care service provisions, while the United States has proposed ''continuity of care,\" consisting of permanent housing and case management services to meet the complicated welfare needs of the homeless. The homelessness policies in these two countries started with providing stable housing, and then followed with psychiatric treatment or employment counseling. In contrast, the homelessness policy in Taiwan focuses on the transient services of providing food, bathing, and emergency accommodation (Fang, 2001; Lin, 1995) . Without stable housing, any provision of transitional support services (welfare application or employment counseling) seems not effective in encouraging the homeless to leave their street life. In conclusion, the premises and principles for formulating policies for homelessness need to be changed in tackling the problem effectively.",

Homelessness policy should focus on both practical solutions for the individual homeless and the overall economic structure and dynamics. (4) In regard to the provision of social welfare services, the problems of homelessness are not only the responsibility of local governments; they also require a broader and integrated national approach and system, as well as the cooperation of inter-county governments to address the problem of the household registry. (5) In formulating social policies, the issue of homelessness is a problem of housing shortage and social imbalances. Thus, the government must adopt integrated and comprehensive homeless welfare policies.",

Then, the workers can suggest other associated services of case management, such as physical or mental treatment, employment counseling services, and building social networks and support.",

For example, when a person is discharged from a hospital, nursing home, prison or corrective institution, or other agency, the associated agencies should make an assessment of that person in terms of his or her family background and employment history, and any risk of becoming homeless. (2) Advocating full employment and a social housing policy: We suggest that losing jobs and inadequate affordable housing are two main reasons for the growth of the population of male homeless adults in Taiwan. However, through an overemphasis on economic development, the government in Taiwan maintains a limited social contract with its citizens. In terms of democratic development in Taiwan, social groups and welfare organizations have long played an important role in advocating for social polices for disadvantaged groups. Organizations working for the homeless should work together with other social welfare groups to advocate that the government develop policies for full employment and social housing. (3) Developing a homeless information system and services: Along with the increasing importance of performance pledges and efficiency, the central government should develop a national information system about the use of welfare services by the homeless. Such a homeless information system could trace and develop information about how the homeless use welfare services over the long term. This information could then be analyzed and the findings used for the improvement or modification of homeless outreach work and accommodation services, as well as for the formulation of future policies.",
