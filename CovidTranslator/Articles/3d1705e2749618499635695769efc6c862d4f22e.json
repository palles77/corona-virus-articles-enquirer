            "text": "Syndrome-and disease-based kits. The conventional diagnosis of infectious diseases usually relies on a stepwise approach in which the physician examines the patient, diagnoses a clinical syndrome and then tests for pathogens that are potentially responsible for that syndrome, until a diagnosis is made. However, the growing number of emerging pathogens makes it difficult for physicians to memorize the actual list of pathogens for each infectious disease and thus prescribe all the appropriate diagnostic microbiology tests. To reduce the delays associated with resampling or retesting, sampling can be carried out using diagnostic kits that are standardized according to the syndrome or disease. Such a strategy enables optimization of the type and number of specimens collected from the patient, simplification of the laboratory test prescription MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for the physician, and the creation of a scheduled workflow for the nurse and the doctor, and it also allows the clinical laboratory to easily trace samples. To date, such diagnostic kits have been developed for endocarditis, pericarditis, diarrhoea, osteitis, meningitis, encephalitis, uveitis and keratitis [9] [10] [11] , and their design has been based on the repertoire of pathogens responsible for the syndrome or disease, and on the optimal methods to achieve the direct or indirect detection and identification of these pathogens. Further syndrome-based kits can be designed for specific groups of febrile patients, such as those presenting to the emergency room for POC testing, travellers, pilgrims to Mecca (Saudi Arabia), the homeless, or patients with cystic fibrosis and respiratory tract infections 12 . In addition to the broad syndrome-or disease-based kits, pathogen-specific kits can be used, as for pulmonary tuberculosis 13 .",

The conservation of clinical isolates by CMLs might enable tracing of outbreaks and the characterization of emerging pathogens, and could thus be valuable for both public health (disease surveillance and prevention) and scientific purposes. Notably, bacterial strains cultivated from normally sterile organs and body fluids, such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid, might be conserved.

Several approaches, many of which were first implemented by environmental and then clinical microbiologists, have been used in recent years to improve the isolation of fastidious bacteria from human specimens 17, 18 . The first approach, which remains historically the most efficient, is based on empiricism and uses existing media or media with enrichment components added. For instance, Borrelia recurrentis was reputed to be non-cultivable axenically until the blood of a patient with louse-borne relapsing borreliosis was inoculated on media dedicated to Borrelia burgdorferi 19 . In the case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the use of blood-enriched medium enabled the improved and accelerated recovery of colonies 20 . Recently, we developed a strategy named culturomics, which proved to be very successful in isolating previously unknown or uncultivated bacteria (BOX 1) . This empirical approach has the advantage of using common media, but is poorly adapted to the detection of emerging fastidious bacteria.",

A fourth approach is the use of cell culture, especially the shell vial assay. Briefly, in this assay, ground clinical specimens are inoculated by centrifugation into a layer of eukaryotic cells grown on a 1 cm 2 cover slip at the bottom of a small tube 28 . This method has been shown to be highly efficient for the isolation of fastidious agents, even those that are not strictly intracellular 28 . The versatility of the technique is related to the nearly unlimited choice of cells that can be used for culture, thus widening the spectrum of culture conditions and isolated microorganisms. For example, Rickettsia felis 29 can be grown only in XTC-2 cells, which require a low temperature, and Legionella spp. 30 can be grown only in amoebae.

In addition to the rapidity and low cost of MALDI-TOF MS, other advantages include the precise identification of the isolate at the species level and, in some species, at the subspecies and strain levels. Currently, bacterial species from many genera have been identified by MALDI-TOF MS, including fastidious microorganisms (reviewed in REF. 34 ). However, the discriminatory power of the method varies depending on the species and the exhaustiveness of the database used. Notably, some bacterial taxa are under-represented in databases, and technical problems (such as variations in culture conditions, sample preparation and the spectrometer used) further affect the discriminatory power of this technique 35 . In addition, streptococci, non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria are generally harder to discriminate than other bacteria, although this weakness can be partially corrected by enriching the available databases with spectra from more strains 31 . MALDI-TOF MS can be used for typing community-acquired pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Legionella pneumophila and Yersinia enterocolitica; health care-associated pathogens, such as Corynebacterium striatum 36 and Candida parapsilosis 37 ; and both community-and health care-associated pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus. Finally, MALDI-TOF MS is now routinely used in several large CMLs for Box 1 | Culturomics: the diversification of culture methods for microbial isolation A major challenge in the twenty-first century is the need for a comprehensive characterization of both the human microbiome and its relationships with health and disease 108 . Recent genomic and metagenomic studies have demonstrated that approximately 80% of bacterial species detected in the human gut are either uncultured so far or even unculturable 109 . Therefore, in the omics era, culturing became outdated for the study of complex microbial communities. However, several discrepancies have been observed among metagenomic studies, apparently reflecting biases of the techniques used and the fact that clinically relevant minor populations were not considered. For example, potentially pathogenic bacteria (such as Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi, Tropheryma whipplei and Yersinia enterocolitica) that can be present in faeces at concentrations of <10 5 colony-forming units per ml, were ignored. Thus, we designed a new culture strategy that we named culturomics, which uses diversified culture conditions (medium, temperature and atmosphere) to complement culture-independent approaches and to complete our knowledge of the human microbiota 110 .",

In a second study of a patient receiving massive antibiotic drug therapy for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, 70 distinct culture conditions enabled the isolation of 39 bacterial species, including one new species and three species that had not previously been observed in the human gut 111 . To date, culturomics has yielded 175 bacterial species never previously found in the human gut, and 32 new bacterial genera and/or species, including Microvirga massiliensis, which has the largest genome of the known human-associated bacteria. Metagenomic analysis of the same specimens produced 698 phylotypes, including 282 known species, 51 of which overlapped with the microbiome identified by culturomics. However, despite these promising results and although culturomics might complement metagenomics, notably by overcoming the bias inherent to metagenomic approaches of ignoring minor microbial populations, this new technique is a time-consuming, expensive strategy that, as yet, has not been adapted to routine microbiology.",

MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of antibiotic able to inhibit the growth of a bacterial isolate in vitro, whereas breakpoints are used to predict the clinical outcome of an antibiotic treatment in vivo.

In a similar manner, non-fluorescent DNA microarrays 45 and pyrosequencing 46 can detect gene mutations or SNPs that are known to be associated with M. tuberculosis resistance to antituberculous compounds. DNA microarrays are another new technology that can detect, in a single step, many resistance genes in Gram-negative and Grampositive bacteria 47 . However, microarrays are expensive (~300\u20ac per Mb for microarrays versus 15\u20ac per Mb for high-throughput genome sequencing) and can detect known genes only. Recently, MALDI-TOF MS has also been used clinically for the rapid phenotypic detection of antibiotic resistance, especially of \u03b2-lactamase activity 48 . For example, it is possible to detect carbapenemase activity in bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and in Acinetobacter baumannii through the identification of carbapenem compounds and their degradation products by MALDI-TOF MS in only 1-4 hours and with high sensitivity and specificity [49] [50] [51] (FIG. 2) .

However, these methods often lack reproducibility within and between laboratories. DNA hybridizationbased methods using nucleotide probes, such as DNA macroarrays 73 and DNA microarrays 74 , are expensive, can identify only the genetic markers present on the arrays and thus might underestimate the genetic diversity among bacterial populations. DNA sequencebased methods such as multilocus sequence typing (MLST) 54 , multispacer sequence typing 2 and genome sequencing 62,63 are discriminatory and reproducible, but are time-consuming and can be expensive. Although genotyping all the pathogenic isolates from all cultures would probably have a significant impact on infection control policies and their execution, most genotyping techniques are not carried out routinely, except for the detection of specific clones of certain pathogens. For example, M. tuberculosis str. Beijing can be detected within 2 hours using specific RT-PCR 75 , enabling patient isolation, contact tracing and extended antituberculous treatment.",

To date, several POC tests, such as the immunochromatographic detection of Streptococcus pyogenes antigen in the throat and Plasmodium falciparum in the blood, have demonstrated their usefulness in physicians' offices and on board ships visiting malaria-endemic countries (D.R., unpublished observations). POCLs should provide an accurate and rapid answer to a limited number of clinical microbiology questions and have a clear impact on patient management 14 . POC assays address the requirements to hospitalize patients, to isolate contagious individuals, and to initiate and focus anti-infective therapy. Assays routinely used in POCLs include those developed to detect bacteria (for example, Bordetella pertussis, C. difficile, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes), viruses (including adenoviruses, dengue virus, enteroviruses and influenza viruses) and parasites (such as P. falciparum). Early studies have demonstrated that on-site POCLs met physicians' needs and have influenced the management of up to 8% of the patients who presented to emergency wards 14 . This strategy might represent a major evolution of decision-making regarding the manage ment of infectious diseases and patient care. In particular, it has been demonstrated that the POCL strategy enables the rapid adaptation of antibiotic therapy for patients with bacterial meningitis and reduces the length of the hospital stay for patients with viral meningitis 14 . Typically, POCLs feature operator-independent tests, including RT-PCR and immunochromatographic assays, most of which are cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Commission. Compared with standard microbiological procedures, most POC tests have a high positive predictive value, but some of them lack sensitivity 93, 94 .",

For years, CMLs have automated various tasks, such as blood culture monitoring, biochemical phenotypic identification of bacteria and yeasts, antibiotic-susceptibility testing, Gram staining, DNA extraction and PCR amplification. The automated early detection of positive blood cultures and the identi fication of the pathogens and their antimicrobial suscepti bilities can significantly reduce mortality in patients with bacteraemia and are among the most important functions of CMLs 98 .

However, most specimens (except urine specimens) require time-consuming pretreatment, such as fluid sputum sample preparation or solid specimen grinding, or the use of specific and expensive swabs. Concomitantly, there is an increasing need to freeze and store samples in biobanks after inoculation or DNA extraction. Therefore, the future generation of automated plate streakers should incorporate functionalities such as aliquoting or DNA extraction or should connect to automated DNA extraction and/or amplification systems, such as the GeneXpert system (Cepheid). Finally, with the aim of complete automation, these systems should be coupled with automated urinary flow cytometry 100 and automated incubation in adapted atmospheres.

Therefore, the correct interpretation of microbiology results is crucial. Interpretation can be improved by automated interpretation software that reports any unknown or impossible phenotype or genotype. Automated systems such as VITEK2 (BioM\u00e9rieux), Phoenix (Becton, Dickinson and Co.) and EPIMIC 52 enable the detection of bacterial isolates that are either taxonomically unusual in a certain clinical syndrome or specimen type, or exhibit a new or rare antibiotic resistance profile. CMLs either use commercially available MALDI-TOF MS spectrum databases (such as those from Bruker Daltonik, Shimadzu or BioM\u00e9rieux) for identifying bacterial isolates, or develop their own databases 15 . In addition, results from genotyping methods can be compared to online databases 69 Reporting can be carried out using laboratory information systems, electronic dashboards or mobile phones (for oral or SMS communications), thereby enabling physicians to receive timely alerts. In our centre, following the development of POCLs, we implemented SMS-based transmission of results to inform physicians as quickly as possible. Physicians might also use personal information systems to access other laboratory or clinical-patient data, or local epidemiological data. Another important aspect of reporting is warning the local, national and international medical communities (the CDC, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO) in case of the emergence of unusual infectious diseases with epidemic potential. the processing of specimens from patients who are thought to have an infectious disease. Sampling is carried out using syndrome-and disease-based sampling kits, and the resulting specimens are tested using point-of-care assays, when available. Culturing, strain characterization (phenotypic or molecular identification, and antibiotic-susceptibility testing) and molecular detection in clinical samples are carried out in the core laboratory. Unusual pathogens, conserved by the laboratory, are reported to the physician in charge and possibly to the sanitary authorities, and are further characterized by genome sequencing.

For example, until recently, the usefulness of blood cultures in the emergency room was limited, as the results of identification and antibiotic-susceptibility testing were only available 72 hours after sampling 105 . Under these conditions, either the empirically prescribed antibiotic treatment was effective, or it had to be changed to another treatment, the worst-case scenario being the patient's death before the diagnosis was established. Clearly, CMLs can only have a major impact on early patient management when diagnostic speed enables the appropriate medical decisions to be made rapidly. In terms of treatment, rapid pathogen identification combined with knowledge about where the patient contracted the infection (for example, whether it was hospital acquired or community acquired) enables the presumptive deduction of antimicrobial susceptibility, and such antibiotic stewardship based on rapid diagnostics can reduce hospitalization costs 106 . Another crucial challenge for clinical microbiology, at a time when the need for cost reduction favours laboratory concentration, is to avoid a disconnection between core CMLs and clinical settings.

Early information sharing is mandatory for outbreak control, as demonstrated by a global outbreak of cotrimoxazole-resistant E. coli, the source of which remains mysterious, although links with poultry have been proposed 107 . CMLs also have a role in syndromic surveillance (that is, monitoring the type of specimens and the associated syndromes) and alerting, which can lead to the discovery of unexplained illnesses. As an example, an increase in the number of cerebrospinal fluid samples referred to the laboratory in the absence of an aetiologically labelled outbreak of meningitis should alert laboratory technicians and prompt the search for a new pathogen. Likewise, the emergence of an atypical organism must be reported through warning systems such as ProMED-mail or EuroTravNet, but probably also at the national and European levels.

Faster reporting of identification and antimicrobial-susceptibility results can significantly reduce the length of hospital stay and the overall costs103 . Of course, faster reporting implies that CMLs should follow technological progress and be equipped with the fastest microbiological methods104 .",
