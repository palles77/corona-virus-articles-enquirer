Often these injuries cause significant bleeding, increased secretions, edema, and hematomas, leading to respiratory distress and airway compromise. Penetrating injuries from bullets, knives, and animal bites also may cause significant airway compromise. Acid or base ingestions (caustics) may cause pharyngeal, laryngeal, or esophageal injury.

Many experts recommend that a rapid antigen test or throat culture be performed to confirm the diagnosis of GABHS because the diagnosis cannot be made accurately on clinical grounds alone. Others believe that the presence of a constellation of physical findings can predict the probability of infection from GABHS (Table 64 -2). Depending on the practice of the generalist, this categorization may be used to develop an efficient diagnostic and treatment approach. Patients may be treated empirically without rapid antigen or throat culture testing (high-risk group [>65% probability]) or not treated and not tested (low-risk group [<15% probability]). Children in the moderate-risk group (15% to 65% probability) should be tested to determine whether they have GABHS infection. Other physical findings suggesting GABHS infection are petechiae on the soft palate ( Fig. 64 -2) and uvula; a red and inflamed uvula; a strawberry tongue; and Pastia's lines, which accompany the scarlatiniform rash of scarlet fever. Abdominal pain on history or physical examination is common with GABHS pharyngitis. Adolescents and young adults who have similar clinical findings, including a scarlatiniform rash, but without a strawberry tongue or palatal petechiae, may have pharyngitis secondary to A. haemolyticum.",

Pharyngitis also may occur secondary to herpes simplex virus (HSV), but vesicles and ulcers almost always are present anteriorly . Inflammation of the gingiva (herpes gingivostomatitis) distinguishes HSV from enteroviral infection. High fever is characteristic of these infections, but refusal to eat and drink from painful lesions is more common in HSV infection. Fever; swollen, red tonsils; tonsillar exudate; cervical lymphadenopathy; diffuse adenopathy; and palatal petechiae are characteristic findings of infectious mononucleosis. Distinguishing between GABHS infection and infectious mononucleosis (EBV) can be difficult. Fatigue and malaise preceding other symptoms are more characteristic of mononucleosis. Eyelid or periorbital edema, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and a maculopapular rash without the other clinical characteristics of scarlet fever suggest mononucleosis. Diphtheria is rare, but should be considered in unimmunized children with a pharyngeal and tonsillar grayish pseudomembranous exudate that bleeds when removal is attempted. Peritonsillar abscess usually presents after GABHS pharyngitis or injury to the posterior pharynx with significant pain on swallowing, trismus, and a muffled voice often called a \"hot potato\" voice. On physical examination, there is a characteristic \"bulge\" in the soft palate on the side of the affected tonsil, and the uvula is pushed to the opposite side of the pharynx (Fig. 64-6 ). Retropharyngeal abscess usually is preceded by pharyngitis or injury to the posterior pharynx. Children with this disorder usually have a high fever; appear toxic; often drool because of the pain associated with swallowing; and may have neck pain, torticollis, or meningismus. Bulging of the posterior pharyngeal wall may be appreciated, and cervical adenitis may be present. A lateral pharyngeal abscess presents with clinical findings almost identical to findings of retropharyngeal abscess. Torticollis may be present from tenderness and swelling of the neck on the affected side.

Children with epiglottitis have pain with swallowing, drool, are stridorous, and almost always assume a tripod position. Croup typically begins with upper respiratory symptoms followed by a barklike cough, hoarseness, and inspiratory stridor. Children with croup are usually not ill appearing, swallow without difficulty, and do not drool. Croup is usually a self-limited illness that resolves over 2 to 3 days. Adenotonsillar hypertrophy is suggested by a history of mouth breathing, loud snoring, hyponasal voice, and sleep apnea. Physical examination may reveal adenoid facies (open mouth, dull appearance, dark discoloration under the eyes) and enlarged tonsils. The size of the adenoids is difficult to determine on examination, but enlargement may be presumed in a child with hyponasality, normal nasal mucosa, and no palatal abnormalities (e.g., a bifid uvula indicating a submucous cleft palate). The extent of tonsillar obstruction ( Fig. 64-7) is based on the percent of obstruction of the oropharynx between anterior pillars and is scored from 0 to 4+: 0, tonsils are in the fossa, without obstruction; 1+, less than 25% obstruction; 2+, less than 50% obstruction; 3+, less than 75% obstruction; and 4+, more than 75% obstruction (see the CD-ROM). The clinical diagnosis of obstructive sleep disorders, particularly obstructive sleep apnea, can be made with an historical account of a child's sleep pattern. The most common complaint is of snoring, usually associated with irregular breathing, paradoxical chest/abdomen movement, difficulty breathing, decreased or no airflow when attempting to breathe, sleeping in an unusual position, restlessness, frequent apneic episodes, and sometimes cyanosis. Videotaping of a child's sleep pattern by the parent may be helpful to the physician. Enuresis also may be a frequent nighttime complaint. Mouth breathing and hyponasal speech are common daytime symptoms. Poor school performance or aggressive or hyperactive behavior may be observed in children with sleep disorders.

Although rapid streptococcal antigen detection tests provide immediate results and are reliable when they are positive (approximately 95% specificity), they are less reliable when negative (approximately 80% to 90% sensitive).

Lateral soft tissue radiographs of the neck are helpful in patients suspected of having a retropharyngeal abscess and may be used as a screening study. If the lateral neck film suggests a retropharyngeal abscess or if there is a high degree of clinical suspicion for this diagnosis, computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast enhancement from the base of the cranium to the upper mediastinum usually is recommended for better delineation of the abscess and surrounding tissue. A CT scan also should be obtained if there is suspicion of a lateral pharyngeal abscess. Peritonsillar abscess is usually a clinical diagnosis, but in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear, CT scan is beneficial. The information obtained by CT is comparable to that of magnetic resonance imaging, and CT generally is more readily available and is less costly. Ultrasound examination of the head and neck for deep infection has not been shown to be as good an imaging study as CT. Chest radiographs or CT may be helpful if there is concern of extension of the infection into the mediastinum.",

Patients who have suppurative complications, such as peritonsillar abscess; are toxic appearing; have scarlet fever; or have a past history of rheumatic fever should be treated with penicillin on the basis of clinical findings. Confirmation of infection by rapid streptococcus test or throat culture is unnecessary in these situations. If streptococcal pharyngitis is treated within 9 days of the initial symptoms, rheumatic fever can be prevented. Antibiotic therapy probably does not affect the development of glomerulonephritis. Antibiotics used for streptococcal pharyngitis are listed in Table 64 -3. Oral penicillin needs to be administered only two to three times per day. Patients should be advised that it is important to complete the full 10-day course, even if the child feels better after 2 to 3 days. Intramuscular penicillin should be administered when there are concerns about compliance or potential complications, such as in children with a history of rheumatic fever. The disadvantages of intramuscular penicillin are pain and allergic reactions. Bicillin C-R, containing procaine and benzathine penicillin, is the preferred method of delivering intramuscular penicillin to children.
