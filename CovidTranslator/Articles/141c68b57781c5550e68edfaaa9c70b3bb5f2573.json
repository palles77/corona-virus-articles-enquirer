DF is also a notifiable infectious disease in Japan, designated by the Infectious Disease Control Law in 1999 [9, 10] . In Japan, there were DF outbreaks between 1942 and 1945; however, no domestic cases were reported prior to 2014 [9e11] when Japan experienced an unexpected small dengue outbreak in 2014 [12] .",

In this study, the authors conducted a comparative observation of the epidemiological characteristics and risk factors of DF between Korea and Japan during 2006 to 2010. To compare the epidemiological characteristics of dengue cases imported by travelers or immigration in both Korea and Japan, the authors concentrated on dengue incidence and related risk factors. During 2006e2010, 367 and 589 imported dengue cases were reported in Korea and Japan, respectively. In Korea, the presumptive origins for the dengue infections were Southeast Asia (82.6%), Southern Asia (13.9%), Eastern Asia (1.1%), South America (0.3%), Central America (0.3%), Africa (0.3%), and other countries (1.6%). In Japan, the origins of the infections were Southeast Asia (69.8%), Southern Asia (20.0%), Eastern Asia (1.7%), South America (2.5%), Central America (1.2%), Africa (1.2%), Oceania (2.4%), and other countries (1.2%). In both countries, more dengue cases were reported for men than for women (p < 0.01), and those aged 20 to 30 years accounted for more than 60% of the total number of cases. The frequency of imported cases in summer and autumn (approximately 70% of total cases) was similar in both countries because of vacation season [13] .",
