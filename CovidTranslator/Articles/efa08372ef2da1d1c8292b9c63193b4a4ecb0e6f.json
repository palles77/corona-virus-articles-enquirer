Myxoma virus is readily propagated at 35\u00b0C on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated hens' eggs, forming distinct pocks (Fenner and Mclntyre, 1956) . Different strains of virus cause pocks of various sizes, the variation being sufficiently distinct to allow tentative strain identification.

The virus can also be propagated in cell cultures derived from rabbits and other species, including chicken, squirrel, rat, hamster, guinea pig, and human . Distinct differences in plaque size on rabbit kidney cell cultures can be demon strated between the South American and California strains, the former causing much larger plaques . The most sensitive method for isolation of myxoma vi rus under laboratory conditions is inoculation of the skin of European rabbits (Fenner and Mclntyre, 1956 ). c. EPIDEMIOLOGY. Myxomatosis is endemic on four conti nents: South America, North America, Europe, and Australia. In Brazil and Uruguay, the virus is endemic in wild rabbits of the genus Sylvilagus, particularly S. brasiliensis . A similar situation may exist in Panama and Colombia, where the strains of virus are similar in virulence to South American strains but antigenically more closely related to the California strains . In the forested area of Argen tina the virus is also endemic in Sylvilagus rabbits, but in the southern part of the country and in Chile the principal reser voir is the wild European rabbit . The California strains of myxoma virus, also known as the California rabbit fibroma virus , are en demic in wild rabbits of the genus Sylvilagus, especially 5. bachmani, which serves as the principal source of infection for domestic rabbits . In Australia, the myxoma virus has been endemic in wild European rabbits since its introduction into the rabbit population in 1950. Fol lowing the introduction of the virus into France in 1952, myx omatosis has become established in most countries of Europe, the wild European rabbit (O. cuniculus) serving as the pre dominant host species.",

Different strains of virus cause pocks of various sizes, the variation being sufficiently distinct to allow tentative strain identification. The South American strains cause large pocks, whereas the California strains produce small focal lesions on the membrane (Fenner and . The virus can also be propagated in cell cultures derived from rabbits and other species, including chicken, squirrel, rat; hamster, guinea pig, and human . Distinct differences in plaque size on rabbit kidney cell cultures can be demonstrated between the South American and California strains, the former causing much larger plaques . The most sensitive method for isolation of myxoma virus under laboratory conditions is inoculation of the skin of European rabbits (Fenner and McIntyre, 1956 ). c. EPIDEMIOLOGY. Myxomatosis is endemic on four continents: South America, North America, Europe, and Australia. In Brazil and Uruguay, the virus is endemic in wild rabbits of the genus Sylvilagus, particularly S. brasiliensis . A similar situation may exist in Panama and Colombia, where the strains of virus are similar in virulence to South American strains but antigenically more closely related to the California strains . In the forested area of Argentina the virus is also endemic in Sylvilagus rabbits, but in the RONALD F. DIGIACOMO AND C. JOHN MARE southern part of the country and in Chile the principal reservoir is the wild European rabbit . The California strains of myxoma virus, also known as the California rabbit fibroma virus , are endemic in wild rabbits of the genus Sylvilagus, especially S. bachmani, which serves as the principal source of infection for domestic rabbits (Marshall et af., 1963) . In Australia, the myxoma virus has been endemic in wild European rabbits since its introduction into the rabbit population in 1950. Following the introduction of the virus into France in 1952, myxomatosis has become established in most countries of Europe, the wild European rabbit (0. cuniculus) serving as the predominant host species.",

Mosquitoes play a minor role as vectors, whereas the rabbit flea, S. cuniculi, which is less influenced by seasonal changes, is the major vector ). The myxoma virus in Britain has not undergone the rapid loss of virulence observed with the Aus tralian and French viruses. The increase in resistance to myx omatosis in wild rabbit populations has resulted in the appearance of more virulent strains of myxoma virus . While mildly virulent strains have emerged in Britain, the predominant strains are moderately virulent (Chappie and Bowen, 1963; Chappie and Lewis, 1964; Fenner and Chappie, 1965) , with recent estimates of between 47 and 69% mortality in infected rabbits . The different evolution of myxoma virus in Britain has been attributed to the fact that the the virus is predominantly flea transmitted. The flea is less seasonal and less mobile than the mosquito. That fleas move in large numbers from dead animals while moving only occasionally from live ones would seem to favor transmission of virulent virus strains . The proportion of infective fleas produced is inversely related to the survival time of rabbits following infec tion . The flea is also an ef fective reservoir of virus, possessing a longer life span than mosquitoes. The life span of active female mosquitoes is usu ally 2-3 weeks, whereas fleas have been known to feed actively for over 1 year. The myxoma virus can persist for 105 days in rabbit fleas with no rabbit contact in artificial burrows (Chappie and Lewis, 1965 . In the brush rabbit (S. bachmani), skin tumors, rarely more than 1 cm in diameter, develop at the base of one or both ears . Experi mental inoculation of S. bachmani with the South American and California strains results in development of local skin tu mors, with the South American virus causing slightly more prominent tumors than the California virus (Marshall and Reg nery, 1963) . Cottontail rabbits (S. floridanus, Sylvilagus nuttalli, and Sylvilagus auduboni) develop small lesions at the site of California virus inoculation, but in S. nuttalli and S. auduboni the South American virus induces a larger lesion .",

The flea reproduced in wild rabbit populations and transmitted both introduced and field strains of myxoma virus . As a result of flea introduction, myxomatosis has become more prevalent in drier tableland areas , and outbreaks of myxomatosis have shifted from summer to spring Shepherd et ai., 1978) . In France, there is evidence that mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles are the principal vectors of summer epidemics. The rabbit flea, S. cuniculi, is probably a major vector, especially during winter months when mosquito activity is low .",

            "text": "Myxomatosis in Britain is characterized by milder seasonal fluctuations in disease incidence than in Australia, California, and France . Mosquitoes playa minor role as vectors, whereas the rabbit flea, S. cuniculi, which is less influenced by seasonal changes, is the major vector Andrewes et ai., 1959; ). The myxoma virus in Britain has not undergone the rapid loss of virulence observed with the Australian and French viruses. The increase in resistance to myxomatosis in wild rabbit populations has resulted in the appearance of more virulent strains of myxoma virus . While mildly virulent strains have emerged in Britain, the predominant strains are moderately virulent (Chapple and Bowen, 1963; Chapple and Lewis, 1964; Fenner and Chapple, 1965) , with recent estimates of between 47 and 69% mortality in infected rabbits . The different evolution of myxoma virus in Britain has been attributed to the fact that the the virus is predominantly flea transmitted. The flea is less seasonal and less mobile than the mosquito. That fleas move in large numbers from dead animals while moving only occasionally from live ones would seem to favor transmission of virulent virus strains . The proportion of infective fleas produced is inversely related to the survival time of rabbits following infection . The flea is also an effective reservoir of virus, possessing a longer life span than mosquitoes. The life span of active female mosquitoes is usually 2-3 weeks, whereas fleas have been known to feed actively 175 for over 1 year. The myxoma virus can persist for 105 days in rabbit fleas with no rabbit contact in artificial burrows (Chapple and Lewis, 1965 . In the brush rabbit (S. bachmani), skin tumors, rarely more than 1 cm in diameter, develop at the base of one or both ears . Experimental inoculation of S. bachmani with the South American and California strains results in development of local skin tumors, with the South American virus causing slightly more prominent tumors than the California virus . Cottontail rabbits (S. flo ridanus, Sylvilagus nuttalli, and Sylvilagus audubon;) develop small lesions at the site of California virus inoculation, but in S. nuttalli and S. auduboni the South American virus induces a larger lesion .",

Infection with the California viruses may be harder to diagnose, however, owing to the frequent absence of skin nodules and other signs of disease. Diagnosis should be confirmed by virus isolation. The technique of choice is intracutaneous inoculation of young susceptible rabbits with fresh tissue collected from lesions free of bacterial contamination. Lesions should develop at the site of inoculation within 1 week. The virus can be isolated by chorioallantoic membrane inoculation of 11-to 13-day-old embryonated chicken eggs followed by incubation at 35\u00b0C for 4 to 6 days. Distinct focal pocks develop if the virus is present. The South American viruses cause large pocks, the California virus intermediate sized pocks, and the fibroma virus minute pocks. Virus isolation on chicken embryo fibroblast cell cultures or any one of several cell types can also be accomplished. The virus isolated can be identified as myxoma virus by a direct fluorescent antibody test , the plaque-neutralization test , or the agar-gel diffusion microprecipitation test . Infec tion of Sylvilagus rabbits with myxoma virus clinically resem bles fibromatosis and should be differentiated from the latter disease by inoculation of young susceptible rabbits of the genus Oryctolagus. Myxomatosis causes severe to fatal disease, whereas fibromatosis causes a localized fibroma. g. CONTROL. Control of myxomatosis is of prime impor tance in areas where the virus is endemic in wild rabbit popu lations. In such areas, vector control, including adequate screen ing to exclude mosquitoes, serves to keep the disease under control. Newly introduced rabbits should be quarantined in an insect-proof facility for 2 weeks. To prevent spread within a colony, all sick rabbits should be isolated. Fibroma virus has been used as a live vaccine for myxomatosis, but results have been variable . A live attenuated myxomatosis vaccine (the MSD strain) results in a mild reac tion followed by immunity persisting for 9 months . Jiran et al. (1970) found this virus to be too 9.

            "text": "f. DIAGNOSIS. Myxomatosis in European rabbits can usually be diagnosed by the clinicopathological features. Infection with the California viruses may be harder to diagnose, however, owing to the frequent absence of skin nodules and other signs of disease. Diagnosis should be confirmed by virus isolation. The technique of choice is intracutaneous inoculation of young susceptible rabbits with fresh tissue collected from lesions free of bacterial contamination. Lesions should develop at the site of inoculation within I week. The virus can be isolated by chorioallantoic membrane inoculation of 11-to 13-day-old embryonated chicken eggs followed by incubation at 35\u00b0C for 4 to 6 days. Distinct focal pocks develop if the virus is present. The South American viruses cause large pocks, the California virus intermediate sized pocks, and the fibroma virus minute pocks. Virus isolation on chicken embryo fibroblast cell cultures or anyone of several cell types can also be accomplished. The virus isolated can be identified as myxoma virus by a direct fluorescent antibody test , the plaque-neutralization test , or the agar-gel diffusion microprecipitation test . Infection of Sylvilagus rabbits with myxoma virus clinically resembles fibromatosis and should be differentiated from the latter disease by inoculation of young susceptible rabbits of the genus Oryctolagus. Myxomatosis causes severe to fatal disease, whereas fibromatosis causes a localized fibroma. g. CONTROL. Control of myxomatosis is of prime importance in areas where the virus is endemic in wild rabbit populations. In such areas, vector control, including adequate screening to exclude mosquitoes, serves to keep the disease under control. Newly introduced rabbits should be quarantined in an insect-proof facility for 2 weeks. To prevent spread within a colony, all sick rabbits should be isolated. Fibroma virus has been used as a live vaccine for myxomatosis, but results have been variable . A live attenuated myxomatosis vaccine (the MSD strain) results in a mild reaction followed by immunity persisting for 9 months Saito, 1964). liran et al. (1970) found this virus to be too RONALDF.DIGIACOMOANDC.JOHNMARE virulent for use as a vaccine and further attenuated it by serial passage in rabbit kidney cell cultures. The additionally modified virus, designated MSD/B, was safe and highly immunogenic. Other attenuated strains have been used as vaccines in Europe with some success, and experiments with a live virus vaccine (SG-33) using a flea, Xenopsylla cunicularis, as the vector ap pear promising .",

The virus can be isolated by chorioallantoic membrane inoculation of chicken embryos or by cell culture propagation of the virus on cells derived from rabbits, mice, or any of sev eral animal species . The virus may be identified by the fluorescent antibody procedure, hemagglutination inhibition (some strains), or cross-protection tests using vaccinia-immunized and susceptible rabbits. Vacciniaimmunized rabbits should be resistant, whereas severe disease with high mortality should occur in susceptible rabbits. g. CONTROL. Because the natural source of virus causing outbreaks has not been determined, control measures to prevent the occurrence of disease have not been developed. In out breaks, preventing spread of the virus in the colony by isolation of sick rabbits has met with mixed success . Investigators using rabbitpox virus experimentally should take exceptional precautions to prevent the virus from reaching susceptible rabbit populations. In an epidemic in a large colony, vaccination with vaccinia virus can be used to protect uninfected rabbits (Rosahn et al, 1936b; ).",

Confirmatory diagnosis can be made by detection of viral antigen in tissues by fluorescent antibody or tissue impression smears (Christensen et aI., 1967) or by virus isolation and identification. The virus can be isolated by chorioallantoic membrane inoculation of chicken embryos or by cell culture propagation of the virus on cells derived from rabbits, mice, or any of several animal species (Christensen et aI., 1967) . The virus may be identified by the fluorescent antibody procedure, hemagglutination inhibition (some strains), or cross-protection tests using vaccinia-immunized and susceptible rabbits. Vacciniaimmunized rabbits should be resistant, whereas severe disease with high mortality should occur in susceptible rabbits. g. CONTROL. Because the natural source of virus causing outbreaks has not been determined, control measures to prevent the occurrence of disease have not been developed. In outbreaks, preventing spread of the virus in the colony by isolation of sick rabbits has met with mixed success Christensen et aI., 1967) . Investigators using rabbitpox virus experimentally should take exceptional precautions to prevent the virus from reaching susceptible rabbit populations. In an epidemic in a large colony, vaccination with vaccinia virus can be used to protect uninfected rabbits (Rosahn et aI., 1936b; Boulter et aI., 1971 ).",

The cottontail rabbit or Shope papillomavirus was recognized as a transmissible agent by while they were attempting to define the etiology of wartlike tumors on cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) in the midwestern United States. They demonstrated the filterability of the infectious agent, transmitted it to other cottontail rab bits as well as domestic rabbits , and described the histopathology of the disease. Rabbit papillomatosis was initially considered a natural benign disease of cottontail rabbits only; however, spontaneous outbreaks of papillomatosis in Oryctolagus cuniculus indicates that the disease has greater relevance. Soon after discovery of the virus, it was also shown to cause malignant neoplasms histologically resembling squamous cell carcinomas Kidd and Rous, 1940) . This was the first recognition of an oncogenic virus in mammals. The disease has served as a model system in numerous investigations aimed at the elucidation of the role of viruses in the etiology of cancer in humans and animals (Evans etaL, 1962a,b; Kreiderand Bartlett, 1981 Georges etaL, 1984; .",

The virus is the type species of the genus Papillomavirus of the Papovaviridae and possesses the characteristic circular DNA genome, icosahedral structure, and other chemical and physical properties of this family . The virus is antigenically distinct from other members of the genus Papillomavirus. Nuclear and cytoplasmic (Ishimoto etaL, 1970) viral antigens have been demonstrated by immunofluorescence in virus-inoculated nor mal skin cells and virus-induced papillomas. However, the sig nificance of these findings is difficult to interpret since controls for rabbit kidney vacuolating virus, a passenger virus (Hartley and Rowe, 1964) , were usually not included (Kreider and Bart lett, 1981) . The virus can be maintained by serial propagation in the skin of cottontail rabbits, inoculated intracutaneously or scarified with virus . Intramuscular in oculation does not result in clinical papillomatosis. Dogs, cats, pigs, goats, rats, mice, and guinea pigs are refractory to the virus. The skin of embryonic rats is susceptible to the virus, and typical papillomas develop following inoculation ; however, few papillomas develop, and they regress un less the host is immunosuppressed (Kreider et aL, 1971) .",

Nematodes may be involved in the natural transmission of virus . Experimentally, papillomas were 9. VIRAL DISEASES 1989).

The cottontail rabbit or Shope papillomavirus was recognized as a transmissible agent by while they were attempting to define the etiology of wartlike tumors on cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus jioridanus) in the midwestern United States. They demonstrated the filterability of the infectious agent, transmitted it to other cottontail rabbits as well as domestic rabbits , and described the histopathology of the disease. Rabbit papillomatosis was initially considered a natural benign disease of cottontail rabbits only; however, spontaneous outbreaks of papillomatosis in Oryctolagus cuniculus indicates that the disease has greater relevance. Soon after discovery of the virus, it was also shown to cause malignant neoplasms histologically resembling squamous cell carcinomas Kidd and Rous, 1940) . This was the first recognition of an oncogenic virus in mammals. The disease has served as a model system in numerous investigations aimed at the elucidation of the role of viruses in the etiology of cancer in humans and animals (Evans et aI., 1962a,b; Bartlett, 1981, 1985; Georgesetal., 1984; .",

The virus is the type species of the genus Papillomavirus of the Papovaviridae and possesses the characteristic circular DNA genome, icosahedral structure, and other chemical and physical properties of this family Murphy et ai., 1981; . The virus is antigenically distinct from other members of the genus Papilloma virus. Nuclear and cytoplasmic viral antigens have been demonstrated by immunofluorescence in virus-inoculated normal skin cells and virus-induced papillomas. However, the significance of these findings is difficult to interpret since controls for rabbit kidney vacuolating virus, a passenger virus (Hartley and Rowe, 1964) , were usually not included . The virus can be maintained by serial propagation in the skin of cottontail rabbits, inoculated intracutaneously or scarified with virus . Intramuscular inoculation does not result in clinical papillomatosis. Dogs, cats, pigs, goats, rats, mice, and guinea pigs are refractory to the virus. The skin of embryonic rats is susceptible to the virus, and typical papillomas develop following inoculation ; however, few papillomas develop, and they regress unless the host is immunosuppressed (Kreider et al., 1971) .",

In outbreaks of diarrhea associated with rotavirus infection, rabbits 30-80 days old are usually affected (Sato et aI., 1982; Peeters et aI., 1984) . Rabbits exhibit severe mucous or watery diarrhea, anorexia, and dehydration, with mortality of 60-80%. In one outbreak, rabbits 8 to 12 days old had a greenish-yellow watery diarrhea .

Later, it was shown that the major target organ was the heart, and the name infectious cardiomyopathy was suggested, since the etiologic agent appeared to be a coronavirus . The resemblance of the clinicopathological features to feline infectious peritonitis, a systemic coronavirus infection of cats, was noted . The failure to propa gate the agent in vitro has precluded more definitive character ization.

Clinical signs and pathological findings alone are not diagnostic, although villous atrophy and degeneration and desquamation of enterocytes at the tips of villi in the small intestine are characteristic features. Rotaviral diarrhea must be differentiated from other diarrheal diseases of rabbits such as coccidiosis, salmonellosis, Tyzzer's disease, clostridial enterotoxemia, and colibacillosis. In weanling rabbits with severe disease, the possibility of dual infections should be considered since rotavirus infections are usually mild. Electron microscop; (Peeters et ai., 1984; Schoeb et ai., 1986) or a capture enzymelinked immunosorbent assay can be used to detect rotavirus in feces Conner et aI., 1988; . Cytoplasmic fluorescence can be observed at the tips of ileal villi using indirect immunofluorescence (Petric et aI., 1978) . Serum antibodies to rotavirus can be detected by enzyme immunoassay Hambraeus et al., 1989; . Rabbits with rotaviral diarrhea usually have no or low concentrations of antibody to rotavirus, with a subsequent rise 2 to 4 weeks after onset of signs (Bryden et aI., 1976; Sato et aI., 1982) . Nonaffected littermates develop high antibody concentrations, reflecting concurrent subclinical infections. RONALD F. DIGIACOMO AND C. JOHN MARE 7. Control Rotavirus is highly infectious and is transmitted by fecaloral spread; however, fomites cannot be excluded. Transplacental transmission has not been demonstrated. Infection appears to be acute and self-limiting. Experimentally, virus is shed in the feces for about 1 week following inoculation (Petric et ai., 1978; Castrucci et ai., 1984; Hambraeus et al., 1989) . Recovered rabbits are refractory to challenge with homologous (Castrucci et aI., 1984; Conner et ai., 1988 Conner et ai., , 1991 Hambraeus et al., 1989) or heterologous viruses (Hambraeus et aI., 1989) . Hence, cessation of breeding or quarantine of the colony for 4 to 6 weeks, to prevent the introduction of susceptible rabbits, should permit the infection to run its course. As seropositive dams are not infectious their offspring should remain free of infection after maternai antibodies disappear. Early weaning of rabbits with high concentrations of passively acquired maternal antibodies and removal to isolated facilities offer the possibility of rederiving rabbits free of infection. Prevention of rotavirus infection depends on barrier maintenance of rabbits.",

During the 1960s in Scandinavia, increased mortality in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) inoculated with the Nichols strain of Treponema pallidum ) was attributed to a virus, named the Stockholm agent, present in rabbit testicular emulsions . As the principal necropsy finding was pleural effusion, the name pleural effusion disease was suggested (Fennestad et aI., 1975) . Later, it was shown that the major target organ was the heart, and the name infectious cardiomyopathy was suggested, since the etiologic agent appeared to be a coronavirus (Small et ai., 1979) . The resemblance of the clinicopathological features to feline infectious peritonitis, a systemic coronavirus infection of cats, was noted (Osterhaus et aI., 1982) . The failure to propagate the agent in vitro has precluded more definitive characterization. It is unclear whether the agent is a naturally occurring pathogen of rabbits or a virus from another species adapted to rabbits in contaminated treponemal stocks. However, the disease may be useful as a model for virus-induced cardiomyopathy (Baric et aI., 1990; Edwards et aI., 1992; Alexander et aI., 1992; .",

            "text": "In a complement fixation test, antigens in infectious sera cross-reacted with antisera to the 229E (two-way cross) and OC43 (one-way cross) strains of human coronavirus . Antisera to the rabbit cardiomyopathy agent crossreacted with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) by radioimmunoassay . Prior incubation of the agent with antisera to CCV, FIPV, TGEV, or 229E virus reduced mortality in rabbits following inoculation. However, prior immunization of rabbits with CCV, FIPV, or TGEV had little effect on survival. Immunofluorescent staining of cardiac tissue from diseased rabbits with antisera to 229E virus revealed antigen in myocardial interstitial tissue, and rabbits surviving infection developed antibodies to the vi rus in a complement fixation assay . In an other study, however, surviving rabbits failed to demonstrate antibodies against 229E virus in an enzyme immunoassay and neutralization test, and against OC43 virus in a complement fixation test . c. EPIDEMIOLOGY. When the disease was recognized in 1961, rabbits used in the serial propagation of T. pallidwn had a mortality rate of 2%. By the end of the 1960s, however, mor tality had increased to 35-40% owing to contamination of treponemal stocks with virus . There is no difference in disease among breeds (Gud jonsson and Skog, 1970) or between rabbits in the United States and Sweden . The agent was detected in T. pallidum-infected rabbit tissues from Europe, the United States, and Japan . Nine isolates, ob tained from treponema-infected rabbits in various countries, ex hibited a wide range in pathogenicity when inoculated into rabbits . Whereas virtually all rabbits had fever, mortality ranged from 0 to 88%, and all surviving rabbits resisted challenge with a virulent strain. Two of four dams from litters inoculated at 6 to 9 days of age became in fected, whereas uninoculated littermates or introduced cage-mates failed to develop infection after exposure for several months . Hence, transmission by direct contact occurs rarely. d. CLINICAL SIGNS. Whereas clinical features vary by strain and passage of the agent, inoculated rabbits generally develop a fever in 1 to 4 days which persists for 5 to 10 days. Other clinical signs include anorexia, weight loss, atony, tachypnea, and iridocyclitis. With virulent strains, many rabbits die 3 to 5 days after inoculation, although deaths can occur until 14 days Fennestad etal, 1975 Fennestad etal, , 1986 Fledelius etal, 1978; Small etal, 1979; . Generalized or hindquarter muscular weak ness was also reported in rabbits surviving the acute phase of infection . During the acute phase of infection, rabbits have a transient lymphopenia, followed by heterophilia . Red cell indices were also reduced but returned to normal by 6 weeks after inoculation. There was a transient hypoalbuminemia; however, 7-globulin increased significantly . Serum potassium and lactate dehyrogenase were elevated transiently. Surviving rabbits usually returned to nor mal in 3 to 4 weeks. Reinoculation of surviving rabbits was without effect, indicating development of resistance to the agent Fennestad \u00a3i a/., 1986 ). e. PATHOLOGY. Rabbits dying during the acute phase of disease have pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, and dilation of the right ventricle Alexander et al, , 1993 . The pleural cavities con tain 2-50 ml of fluid, with or without fibrin, and few cells; ascites may also occur in rabbits dying after the first week. There are subepicardial and subendocardial hemorrhages. Other findings may include hepatosplenomegaly and congested lymph nodes. The heart weight is increased, and there is dilation of the right ventricle followed by dilation of the left ventricle. The cause of death appears to be congestive heart failure (Small etal, 1979; Baric etal, 1990; Edwards etal, 1992; Alexander et al, , 1993 . In fatal cases, there is a uniform reduction of splenic white pulp, focal degenerative changes of the thymus and lymph nodes, and mild proliferative changes of renal glomeruli . In rabbits that survive the acute phase, there is multifocal to diffuse myo cardial degeneration and necrosis, focal hepatic necrosis, and proliferative changes in the spleen, lymph nodes, interstitial pulmonary tissue, and renal glomeruli. Lesions similar to those in the heart can occur in the diaphragm . A mild nonsuppurative, nongranulomatous anterior uveitis devel ops during the acute phase of infection and regresses within 4 weeks . At 65 days after infection, myocarditis is evident, and about one-third of rabbits had evi dence of right and/or left-sided cardiac dilation (Baric et al, 9. VIRAL DISEASES inoculated with treponemes, resulted in a similar syndrome (Gudjonsson et aI., 1970) . Differential filtration of pleural fluid and serum from rabbits revealed an infectious particle size of 25-50 nm, which is ether sensitive and inactivated at temperatures of 65\u00b0C or above but not at 56\u00b0C . Sera from rabbits contained pleomorphic virus particles, round or elliptic, 75 to 100 nm in diameter, bearing club-shaped projections 15-20 nm long , whereas plasma from rabbits contained high concentrations of pleomorphic viruslike particles measuring 51 to 98 .nm in diameter with projections 8-13 nm long (Osterhaus et aI., 1982) .

            "text": "In a complement fixation test, antigens in infectious sera cross-reacted with antisera to the 229E (two-way cross) and OC43 (one-way cross) strains of human coronavirus . Antisera to the rabbit cardiomyopathy agent crossreacted with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) by radioimmunoassay . Prior incubation of the agent with antisera to CCV, FIPV, TGEV, or 229E virus reduced mortality in rabbits following inoculation. However, prior immunization of rabbits with CCV, FIPV, or TGEV had little effect on survival. Immunofluorescent staining of cardiac tissue from diseased rabbits with antisera to 229E virus revealed antigen in myocardial interstitial tissue, and rabbits surviving infection developed antibodies to the virus in a complement fixation assay . In another study, however, surviving rabbits failed to demonstrate antibodies against 229E virus in an enzyme immunoassay and neutralization test, and against OC43 virus in a complement fixation test . c. EPIDEMIOLOGY. When the disease was recognized in 1961, rabbits used in the serial propagation of T. pallidum had a mortality rate of 2%. By the end of the 1960s, however, mortality had increased to 35-40% owing to contamination of treponemal stocks with virus . There is no difference in disease among breeds or between rabbits in the United States and Sweden (Gudjonsson et aI., 1970) . The agent was detected in T. pallidum-infected rabbit tissues from Europe, the United States, and Japan . Nine isolates, obtained from treponema-infected rabbits in various countries, exhibited a wide range in pathogenicity when inoculated into rabbits (Fennestad et aI., 1986) . Whereas virtually all rabbits had fever, mortality ranged from 0 to 88%, and all surviving rabbits resisted challenge with a virulent strain. Two of four dams from litters inoculated at 6 to 9 days of age became infected, whereas uninoculated littermates or introduced cage-191 mates failed to develop infection after exposure for several months . Hence, transmission by direct contact occurs rarely. d. CLINICAL SIGNS. Whereas clinical features vary by strain and passage of the agent, inoculated rabbits generally develop a fever in 1 to 4 days which persists for 5 to 10 days. Other clinical signs include anorexia, weight loss, atony, tachypnea, and iridocyclitis. With virulent strains, many rabbits die 3 to 5 days after inoculation, although deaths can occur until 14 days Gudjonsson et aI., 1970; Fennestad et aI., 1975 Fennestad et aI., , 1986 Small et aI., 1979; Baric et aI., 1990) . Generalized or hindquarter muscular weakness was also reported in rabbits surviving the acute phase of infection (Gudjonsson et aI., 1970; Small et aI., 1979) . During the acute phase of infection, rabbits have a transient lymphopenia, followed by heterophilia . Red cell indices were also reduced but returned to normal by 6 weeks after inoculation. There was a transient hypoalbuminemia; however, ')I-globulin increased significantly . Serum potassium and lactate dehyrogenase were elevated transiently. Surviving rabbits usually returned to normal in 3 to 4 weeks. Reinoculation of surviving rabbits was without effect, indicating development of resistance to the agent (Gudjonsson et aI., 1970; . e. PATHOLOGY. Rabbits dying during the acute phase of disease have pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, and dilation of the right ventricle (Fennestad et aI., 1975; Christensen et aI., 1978; Small et aI., 1979; Baric et aI., 1990; Edwards et aI., 1992; Alexander et aI., 1992 Alexander et aI., , 1993 . The pleural cavities contain 2-50 ml of fluid, with or without fibrin, and few cells; ascites may also occur in rabbits dying after the first week. There are subepicardial and subendocardial hemorrhages. Other findings may include hepatosplenomegaly and congested lymph nodes. The heart weight is increased, and there is dilation of the right ventricle followed by dilation of the left ventricle. The cause of death appears to be congestive heart failure (Small et aI., 1979; Baric et aI., 1990; Edwards et aI., 1992; Alexander et aI., 1992 Alexander et aI., , 1993 . In fatal cases, there is a uniform reduction of splenic white pulp, focal degenerative changes of the thymus and lymph nodes, and mild proliferative changes of renal glomeruli Small et aI., 1979) . In rabbits that survive the acute phase, there is multifocal to diffuse myocardial degeneration and necrosis, focal hepatic necrosis, and proliferative changes in the spleen, lymph nodes, interstitial pulmonary tissue, and renal glomeruli. Lesions similar to those in the heart can occur in the diaphragm (Small et aI., 1979) . A mild nonsuppurative, nongranulomatous anterior uveitis develops during the acute phase of infection and regresses within 4 weeks . At 65 days after infection, myocarditis is evident, and about one-third of rabbits had evidence of right and/or left-sided cardiac dilation (Baric et aI., 1990) . After 2 years, rabbits had pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphoid hyperplasia of lymph nodes and spleen, siderosis in the spleen, necrosis and periportal inflammation in the liver, and interstitial fibrosis of the myocardium . No evidence of circulating or tissue immune com plexes was found .",

The disease consistently causes acute hepatic necrosis, which may be the only lesion found. Hepatic necrosis is periportal and diffuse and, when severe, may bridge acini. Small single or multiple intranuclear inclusion bodies can be found in degenerate hepatocytes. There is often little inflammation in necrotic areas. Many tissues, especially the lungs, spleen, and kidneys, may have varying degrees of congestion and hemorrhage due to microinfarction or major venous thrombi. Acute coagulative necrosis due to microinfarction may be found in any organ. Microinfarcts in the brain account for the terminal neurological signs. Pulmonary venous thrombosis accounts for the frothy serosanguinous discharge from the nares seen terminally. A segmental necrotizing enteritis with severe crypt necrosis and villous atrophy similar to that seen with canine or feline parvoviral infections can be found . Lymphoid tissues may have varying degrees of degeneration and karyorrhexis of lymphocytes. The spleen and thymus are more often affected than lymph nodes. f. DIAGNOSIS. A presumptive diagnosis can be made on the basis of the epidemiological features, clinical signs, and patho logical findings . By electron microscopy, viral particles, 28-34 nm in diameter, frequently are found in hepatocytes . The hemagglutination test, with type O human erythrocytes, is use ful for detection of virus in suspensions of liver, lungs, spleen, and kidneys from infected rabbits. Antisera or monoclonal anti bodies to the virus are useful in detecting virus in hepatocytes of infected rabbits by immunoenzyme assays and immunofluorescence tests Rodak et aL, 1990b . Serological tests include the hemagglutination inhibition test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the latter being pref erable because of increased sensitivity and specificity (Rodak etaL, 1990b) . g. CONTROL. Measures to prevent introduction of the virus include restricted access and disinfection of all equipment en tering or leaving a facility . Cages and equipment can be disinfected with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite or 1% formalin. Rabbits from areas with the disease should not be introduced directly into the colony but should be quarantined for at least 1 month. Similarly, colonies with the disease should be quarantined and depopulated, since surviving rabbits shed virus for at least a month . Tissue-derived vaccines, inactivated with formaldehyde or \u00df-propiolactone (Smid etaL, 1991; Arguello Villares, 1991) , have been shown to be safe and efficacious in preventing dis ease. Resistance develops within 1 to 2 weeks after vaccination and lasts for 5 to 15 months. Although disease may be pre vented in vaccinated rabbits, persistent infection may develop on exposure to the virus . Thus, vaccinated rabbits infected with virus should be considered infectious and should not be introduced into previously unexposed rabbitries. Antiserum is also protective .",

            "text": "In most fatal cases, rabbits die from a severe and massive intravascular coagulopathy (Gregg et ai., 1991) . 'The disease consistently causes acute hepatic necrosis, which may be the only lesion found. Hepatic necrosis is periportal and diffuse and, when severe, may bridge acini. Small single or multiple intranuclear inclusion bodies can be found in degenerate hepatocytes. There is often little inflammation in necrotic areas. Many tissues, especially the lungs, spleen, and kidneys, may have varying degrees of congestion and hemorrhage due to microinfarction or major venous thrombi. Acute coagulative necrosis due to microinfarction may be found in any organ. Microinfarcts in the brain account for the terminal neurological signs. Pulmonary venous thrombosis accounts for the frothy serosanguinous discharge from the nares seen terminally. A segmental necrotizing enteritis with severe crypt necrosis and villous atrophy similar to that seen with canine or feline parvoviral infections can be found (Gregg et ai., 1991) . Lymphoid tissues may have varying degrees of degeneration and karyorrhexis of lymphocytes. The spleen and thymus are more often affected than lymph nodes. f. DIAGNOSIS. A presumptive diagnosis can be made on the basis of the epidemiological features, clinical signs, and pathological findings . By electron microscopy, viral particles, 28-34 nm in diameter, frequently are found in hepatocytes Valicek et ai., 1990) . The hemagglutination test, with type 0 human erythrocytes, is useful for detection of virus in suspensions of liver, lungs, spleen, and kidneys from infected rabbits. Antisera or monoclonal antibodies to the virus are useful in detecting virus in hepatocytes of infected rabbits by immunoenzyme assays and immunofluorescence tests Rodak et al., 1990b Capucci et ai., 1991; Gregg et ai., 1991; . Serological tests include the hemagglutination inhibition test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the latter being preferable because of increased sensitivity and specificity (Rodak et ai., 1990b) . g. CONTROL. Measures to prevent introduction of the virus include restricted access and disinfection of all equipment entering or leaving a facility . Cages and equipment can be disinfected with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite or 1% formalin. Rabbits from areas with the disease should not be introduced directly into the colony but should be quarantined for at least 1 month. Similarly, colonies with the disease should be quarantined and depopulated, since surviving rabbits shed 195 virus for at least a month Gregg et aI., 1991) . Tissue-derived vaccines, inactivated with formaldehyde (Du et ai., 1986; or~-propiolactone Arguello Villares, 1991) , have been shown to be safe and efficacious in preventing disease. Resistance develops within 1 to 2 weeks after vaccination and lasts for 5 to 15 months. Although disease may be prevented in vaccinated rabbits, persistent infection may develop on exposure to the virus . Thus, vaccinated rabbits infected with virus should be considered infectious and should not be introduced into previously unexposed rabbitries. Antiserum is also protective .",

A disease, characterized by hemorrhages in the trachea and lungs, pulmonary edema, and necrotic hepatitis, with high mortality, has been observed since 1980-1985 in European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) and mountain hares (Lepus timidus) in several European countries (Morisse et aI., 1990 (Morisse et aI., , 1991 . The disease, named European brown hare syndrome, is similar to rabbit hemorrhagic disease. b. ETIOLOGY. Electron microscopy of hepatocytes from affected hares reveals nonenveloped, icosahedral particles about 30 nm in diameter Marcato et aI., 1991) . Immunoblotting of the virus reveals a major structural protein of about 60 kDa, similar to rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus; however, other proteins of the latter virus are absent, suggesting that the viruses are similar but not identical (Ohlinger and Thiel, 1991; Capucci et ai., 1991) . The European brown hare virus fails to grow in primary hare and rabbit cell lines , and inoculation of mice and guinea pigs failed to induce disease (Henriksen et ai., 1989) . Inoculation of liver homogenates from affected hares into rabbits resulted in a clinical syndrome similar to rabbit hemorrhagic disease. Tissues from inoculated rabbits exhibited hemagglutination with human type 0 erythrocytes, and similar viral particles were detected by electron microscopy. Antiserum against rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus protected rabbits from mortality, and surviving rabbits had antibodies in the hemagglutination inhibition assay . However, other investigators have failed to induce disease in rabbits with the European brown hare virus (Ohlinger and Thiel, 1991; Capucci et ai., 1991) .",

The disease has been reported in wild hares from several European countries, including England , and from breeding farms for hares in Denmark (Henriksen et ai., 1989) and Sweden . In France, Germany, and Italy, the geographic distribution of European brown hare syndrome coincides with viral hemorrhagic disease in wild and.domesticated rabbits (Morisse et aI., 1991; Can-cellotti and Renzi, 1991) . Although systematic studies of the prevalence of infection have not been conducted, sera from most hares contain antibodies to the virus . Young hares are resistant to the virus . The major mode of transmission appears to be fecal-oral spread . Contamination of feed and water with excreta from infected hares is probably a common mode of transmission . Among wild and farmed hares in Denmark and Sweden, mortality is seasonal, beginning in October and continuing through March (Henriksen etai, 1989; Gavier-Widen and Mor ner, 1991) . In England, excessive mortality in wild hares was reported in September through November . d. CLINICAL SIGNS. In general, the disease is acute and highly infectious, with high morbidity and mortality . Clinical signs include de pression, anorexia, muscular tremors, incoordination, paraly sis, convulsions, and occasionally epistaxis. Death occurs 5 to 24 hr after onset of signs, and affected hares rarely recover. The reported morbidity is 75%, and mortality approaches 100% (Henriksen etai, 1989; . e. PATHOLOGY. Death is attributable to multiple organ fail ure resulting from pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, adrenocortical necrosis, renal circulatory disorders, and hepatic necrosis . Gross examination of hares reveals marked pulmonary congestion and edema, as well as hepatic congestion and hemorrhages. Mod erate splenomegaly and gastric ulceration are detected in some hares. A catarrhal to necrotizing conjunctivitis may be present. Microscopically, there is diffuse acute coagulation necrosis of hepatic periportal and midzonal areas, accompanied by forma tion of acidophilic bodies . In many hares, there is basophilic stippling in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in periportal areas, representing granular calcification. Many livers have microvacuolar fatty degeneration. About one-fourth of affected hares have splenic cellular depletion and hyaline-like changes in the sinuses and cords, and about one-third have renal tubular necro sis and calcification. In the brain, cerebral neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells exhibit granulovacuolar degeneration. In apparently healthy hares with antibodies to the virus, hepatic vacuolar degeneration, tracheitis, and hyperplasia of splenic follicles are observed .",

Use of two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), in series, employing monoclonal antibodies, in which the first test detects group antigen and the second virus-specific antigen, has permit ted the detection of European brown hare virus . The ELIS A is preferred for detection of antibodies (Cap ucci et al, 1991) . g. CONTROL. Methods of control in breeding farms for hares are similar to those for rabbit hemorrhagic disease. Pre ventive measures include restricted access, disinfection of equipment, and quarantine of newly acquired hares. As subclinically infected hares may shed virus, serological screening of quarantined hares may be advisable. Only seronegative hares should be permitted entry into the colony. Colonies with the disease should be quarantined and depopulated. No vaccine has been developed for use in hares.",

Although systematic studies of the prevalence of infection have not been conducted, sera from Inost hares contain antibodies to the virus . Young hares are resistant to the virus . The major mode of transmission appears to be fecal-oral spread (Morisse et aI., 1991) . Contamination of feed and water with excreta from infected hares is probably a common mode of transmission . Among wild and farmed hares in Denmark and Sweden, mortality is seasonal, beginning in October and continuing through March . In England, excessive mortality in wild hares was reported in September through November ). d. CLINICAL SIGNS. In general, the disease is acute and highly infectious, with high morbidity and mortality (Henriksen et aI., 1989; Marcato et aI., 1991) . Clinical signs include depression, anorexia, muscular tremors, incoordination, paralysis, convulsions, and occasionally epistaxis. Death occurs 5 to 24 hr after onset of signs, and affected hares rarely recover. The reported morbidity is 750/0, and mortality approaches 1000/0 (Henriksen et aI., 1989; e. PATHOLOGY. Death is attributable to multiple organ failure resulting from pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, adrenocortical necrosis, renal circulatory disorders, and hepatic necrosis Marcato et aI., 1991) . Gross examination of hares reveals marked pulmonary congestion and edema, as well as hepatic congestion and hemorrhages. Moderate splenomegaly and gastric ulceration are detected in some hares. A catarrhal to necrotizing conjunctivitis may be present. Microscopically, there is diffuse acute coagulation necrosis of hepatic periportal and midzonal areas, accompanied by formation of acidophilic bodies (Henriksen et aI., 1989; . In many hares, there is basophilic stippling in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in periportal areas, representing granular calcification. Many livers have microvacuolar fatty degeneration. About one-fourth of affected hares have splenic cellular depletion and hyaline-like changes in the sinuses and cords, and about one-third have renal tubular necrosis and calcification. In the brain, cerebral neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells exhibit granulovacuolar degeneration. In apparently healthy hares with antibodies to the virus, hepatic vacuolar degeneration, tracheitis, and hyperplasia of splenic follicles are observed (Marcato et aI., 1991). f. DIAGNOSIS. Diagnosis is similar to that for rabbit hemorrhagic disease. The hemagglutination test for detection of virus in tissue specimens is less sensitive, possibly owing to the presence of lower concentrations of virus in comparison with rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (Capucci et aI., 1991) . Use of two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), in series, employing monoclonal antibodies, in which the first test detects RONALD F. DIGIACOMO AND C. JOHN MARE group antigen and the second virus-specific antigen, has permitted the detection of European brown hare virus . The ELISA is preferred for detection of antibodies (Capucci et aI., 1991). g. CONTROL. Methods of control in breeding farms for hares are similar to those for rabbit hemorrhagic disease. Preventive measures include restricted access, disinfection of equipment, and quarantine of newly acquired hares. As subclinically infected hares may shed virus, serological screening of quarantined hares may be advisable. Only seronegative hares should be permitted entry into the colony. Colonies with the disease should be quarantined and depopulated. No vaccine has been developed for use in hares.",
