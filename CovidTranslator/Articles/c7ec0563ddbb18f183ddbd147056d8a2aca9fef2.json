Design A prospective, qualitative exploratory study that employed online questionnaires and open-ended, semistructured interviews with two participant groups: (1) global health physicians and (2) global health programme leaders affiliated with USA-based academic medical centres. Open coding procedures and thematic content analysis were used to analyse data and derive themes for discussion.",

Twelve participants completed online questionnaires (7.5% response rate) and eight participants (four survey participants and four additionally recruited participants) participated in in-depth, in-person or phone semi-structured interviews. results Five themes emerged that highlight how global health physicians and academic global health programme leaders perceive global health work abroad in shaping USA-based medical practices: (1) a sense of improved patient rapport, particularly with low-income, refugee and immigrant patients, and improved and more engaged patient care; (2) reduced spending on healthcare services; (3) greater awareness of the social determinants of health; (4) deeper understanding of the USA's healthcare system compared with systems in other countries; and (5) a reinforcement of values that initially motivated physicians to pursue work in global health. Conclusions A majority of participating global health physicians and programme leaders believed that international engagements improved patient care back in the USA. Participant responses relating to the five themes were contextualised by highlighting factors that simultaneously impinge on their ability to provide improved patient care, such as the social determinants of health, and the challenges of changing USA healthcare policy.",

[5] [6] [7] [8] As of 2016, more than one-third of all matriculated USA medical students reported volunteering internationally. 9 To offer medical students opportunities in global health, academic medical institutions establish partnerships with collaborators in LMICs, both public and private, in a range of settings. 10 These relationships vary by programme and school, with the majority providing short-term (typically no more than two months) training or service learning opportunities, such as global health clinical rotations for medical students and residents, direct service delivery engagements, research opportunities in the health sciences and strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba Online questionnaires along with key informant interviews allowed for a more in-depth examination of physician and programme leader perspectives. \u25ba Thematic analysis resulted in five nuanced themes that contributes to an expanded understanding of how global health work shapes a culture of healthcare practice back home in the USA, offering further points for research and exploration. \u25ba Thematic saturation was not achieved through data analysis, as low questionnaire response rate and a small number of interview participants limit the generalisability of research findings.",

We initially used convenience sampling to recruit participants for the online questionnaire by first identifying academic medical institutions with accredited-by the Council on Education for Public Health or Liaison Committee on Medical Education-global health programmes through structured online searches, followed by snowball sampling through colleague recommendations and purposeful sampling to recruit additional interviewees. The study recruitment for the global health physician category required participants to match with the following criteria: 1. USA-trained postresidency physicians currently providing patient care and/or conducting healthcare research, training or mentorship (including education) for at least 1 month out of the year in a World Bank 30 defined LMIC and who are either: a. affiliated with an accredited global health programme supported by an academic medical centre or b. engaged in their work through another organisation or company (eg, an international/non-governmental organisation, consulting/technical assistance organisation or multi/bilateral development agency). 2. US-trained physicians who have at least 5 years of cumulative global health experience in a LMIC. The study recruitment criteria for global health programme leadership required that participants be programme faculty or staff (programme coordinators, administrators and mentors) affiliated with an academic medical institution offering an accredited global health programme. Several selected participants fit the criteria for both global health physician and global health programme leadership, and their responses were analysed within both categories.",

This was reported as either reinforcing participant's prior perspectives on the social determinants of health or as helping participants to recognise the social and political-economic factors related to health both abroad and in the USA. One global health physician working in internal medicine responded that their work abroad led to a broader sense of why their patients are 'how they are, so it is not just they are uneducated, it is also their father is an alcoholic and also that they are addicted to pain pills, and also that they are overweight'. Here, global health work 'helps you connect the dots between seemingly unconnected psychosocial things' (GHP #3, interview). This participant located this thinking within the social determinants of health more broadly: 'Poverty, corruption, gender inequality, lack of education, years of war and the subsequent post-traumatic stress disorder that affects an entire nation all are the biggest influencers of well-being' (GHP #3, questionnaire).",

The study's small sample size was most likely a result of physician and programme leadership survey fatigue-which, the research team was told directly by several who declined to participate-limiting the generalisability of our findings. Future qualitative research on this or similar participant demographics should consider survey fatigue and explore ways to increase response rates, such as more in-person interviews and, if ethically feasible, participant observation. A more grounded research design that develops interview guides based on initial questionnaire responses will likely improve the scope and focus of participant responses, as well. While thematic saturation was not achieved, we hope that our identified themes can act as a starting point for future research on the topic of how global health work is perceived to impact USA patient care. One Open access example might be an experimental study investigating global health physician spending patterns compared with physicians who have not practiced abroad. We also feel that future research seeking to understand the growing interest in the global health field could investigate how perceived conflict of values between altruistically driven physicians and the USA healthcare system could act as a potential force in generating more interest in global health, and how the USA healthcare system or individual institutions could decrease physician discontentment associated with a conflict of care values.",
