Despite the tremendous efforts to control the disease, COVID-19 has now spread to over 100 countries and caused a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in bats; however, the intermediate animal sources of the virus are completely unknown. Here, we investigated the susceptibility of ferrets and animals in close contact with humans to SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks, but efficiently in ferrets and cats. We found that the virus transmits in cats via respiratory droplets. Our study provides important insights into the animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 and animal management for COVID-19 control.",

The nasal turbinate, soft palate, tonsils, trachea, lung, heart, spleen, kidneys, pancreas, small intestine, brain, and liver from each ferret were collected for viral RNA quantification by qPCR and virus titration in Vero E6 cells. Viral RNA (Fig. 1A, B) and infectious virus were detected in the nasal turbinate, soft palate, and tonsils of all four ferrets inoculated with these two viruses, but was not detected in any other organs tested (Fig. 1C, D) . These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can replicate in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets, but its replication in other organs is undetectable.",

Body temperatures and signs of disease were monitored for two weeks. As shown in Fig. 1 , viral RNA was detected in the nasal washes on days 2, 4, 6, and 8 p.i. in all six ferrets inoculated with the two viruses (Fig. 1E, F) . Viral RNA was also detected in some of the rectal swabs of the virus-inoculated ferrets although the copy numbers were notably lower than those in the nasal washes of these ferrets ( fig. S1A, B) .

To monitor respiratory droplet transmission, an uninfected cat was placed in a cage adjacent to each of the infected cats.

Histopathologic studies performed on samples from the virus-inoculated juvenile cats that died or euthanized on day 3 p.i. revealed massive lesions in the nasal and tracheal mucosa epitheliums, and lungs of both cats (fig. S5). These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in cats, with younger cats being more permissive and, perhaps more importantly, the virus can transmit between cats via respiratory droplets.We next investigated the replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in dogs.Five 3-month-old beagles were intranasally inoculated with 10 5 pfu of CTan-H, and housed with two uninoculated beagles in a room. Oropharyngeal and rectal swabs from each beagle were collected on days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 p.i., for viral RNA detection and virus titration in Vero E6 cells. Viral RNA was detected in the rectal swabs of two virus-inoculated dogs on day 2 p.i., and in the rectal swab of one dog on day 6 p.i. (Table 1). One dog that was viral RNA positive by its rectal swab on day 2 p.i. was euthanized on day 4 p.i., but viral RNA was not detected in any organs or tissues collected from this dog (fig. S6). Infectious virus was not detected in any swabs collected from these dogs. Sera were collected from all of the dogs on day 14 p.i. for antibody detection by use of an ELISA. Two virus-inoculated dogs seroconverted; the other two virus-inoculated dogs and the two contact dogs were all seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 according to the ELISA",

All activities inside the P4 labs are monitored by trained guards via video cameras. Only authorized personnel that have received appropriate training can access the P4 facility. Experienced personnel work in pairs in the facilities. Our staff wear powered air-purifying respirators that filter the air, and disposable coveralls when they culture the virus, and wear full body, air-supplied, positive pressure suits when they perform the animal study; they were disinfected before they leave the room and then shower on exiting the facility. The facility is secured by appropriate procedures approved by the HRVI institutional biosafety officers. All facilities, procedures, training records, safety drills, and inventory records are subject to periodicinspections and ongoing oversight by the institutional biosafety officers who consult frequently with the facility managers. The research program, procedures, occupational health plan, security and facilities are reviewed annually by a Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs official. Cells Vero-E6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Virus SARS-CoV-2/CTan/human/2020/Wuhan (CTan-H) was isolated from a human patient and SARS-CoV-2/F13/environment/2020/Wuhan (F13-E, formally designated as SARS-CoV-2/F13/environment/2020/Wuhan, GISAID access no. EPI_ISL_408515) virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in Huanan seafood market, Wuhan, and were kindly provided by professor Guizhen Wu from the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Viral stocks were prepared in Vero E6 cells with DMEM containing 2% FBS, 5 ug/ml TPCK-trypsin, and 30 mmol/L MgCl2. Viruses were harvested and the titers were determined by means of plaque assays in the viral RNA copies in the samples collected from the animals, viral RNA was extracted by using a QIAamp vRNA Minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription was performed by using the HiScript\u00ae II Q RT SuperMix for qPCR (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). qPCR was conducted by using the Applied Biosystems\u00ae QuantStudio\u00ae 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with Premix Ex Taq\u2122 (Probe qPCR), Bulk (TaRaKa, Dalian, China). The N gene-specific primers (forward, 5'-GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT-3'; reverse, 5'-CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG-3) and probe (5'-FAM-TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3') were utilized according to the information provided by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China (http://nmdc.cn/nCoV). The amount of vRNA for the target SARS-CoV-2 N gene was normalized to the standard curve obtained by using a plasmid (pBluescript\u2161SK-N, 4,221 bp) containing the full-length cDNA of the SARS-CoV-2 N gene. ELISA Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by using a Double Antigen Sandwich ELISA Kit (ProtTech, Luoyang, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 100 \u03bcL of sera were added to an antigen-precoated microtiter plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. Plates were then washed 5 times with PBST, and incubated with HRP-conjugated antigen at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. Plates were washed 5 times with PBST, and 100 \u03bcL of substrate solution was added to enable colorimetric analysis. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u03bcL of stop buffer, and optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm.",
