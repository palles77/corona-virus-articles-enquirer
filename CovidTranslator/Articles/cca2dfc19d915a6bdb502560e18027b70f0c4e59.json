SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was unknown prior to the 2003 outbreak of disease and may be a mutant human coronavirus that acquired new virulence factors allowing for infection of the human population [4] . The genomic RNA is encased in nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is surrounded by a lipid membrane containing the Spike glycoprotein (S), membrane glycoprotein (M), and envelope (E) proteins. Oligomers of the S-glycoprotein form a characteristic spike that protrudes from the membrane [4, 5] . Viral entry into host target cells appears to 0264 be mediated by SARS-CoV Spike (S) glycoprotein and is dependent on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the functional receptor [6] . In addition to being responsible for attachment to the cellular receptor, S contains epitopes for viral neutralization and T-cell responses [7] . Studies performed by VRC investigators and colleagues have shown the importance of S-glycoprotein for coronavirus assembly and trafficking [8] . Other studies have demonstrated neutralization of pseudovirions expressing this protein by serum from convalescent SARS patients and the ability of the DNA plasmid vaccine described here to induce protective immunity by eliciting cellular and humoral immunity to SARS-CoV in animal models, including the generation of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) measured in a plaque-reduction assay [8, 9] . Studies performed in Beijing, China with serum from patients with SARS using a neutralization assay against a pseudotyped lentiviral vector bearing the S protein indicated that NAbs were first detected 5-10 days after onset of symptoms, peaked at 20-30 days and were sustained for more than 150 days [10] .",

The dose and route studied in this trial were based on preclinical data and data from clinical trials of VRC DNA vaccines for other pathogens [14] [15] [16] . Subject safety was monitored by evaluating laboratory and clinical findings and adverse reactions at study visits and adverse events were coded with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Solicited symptoms of local and systemic reactogenicity, including pain, redness, swelling, myalgia, malaise, headache, chills, nausea and temperature, were collected by subject self report on 5-day diary cards following each vaccination. Subjects were followed for a total of 32 weeks and study visits were completed in December 2005.",

Following growth of bacterial cells harboring the plasmid, the plasmid DNA is purified and the vaccine does not contain cellular or viral components. The plasmid encodes for a single protein cloned into the expression vector CMV/R, that has been previously described [17] and evaluated in clinical trials for candidate HIV and Ebola DNA vaccines [14, 16] . The plasmid was constructed to produce a deletion mutant of the SARS Spike glycoprotein (Urbani strain, GenBank AY278741) with the cytoplasmic domain truncated (S CD) [9] . The VRC-SRSDNA015-00-VP vaccine is based upon cDNA expression of SARS Spike glycoprotein (Urbani strain) with codon-modification to optimize expression in human cells. It expresses the full sequence except for deletion of the last 13 COOH-terminal amino acids. Vaccine for the clinical trial was prepared under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) conditions by Vical, Inc. (La Jolla, CA).

The SARS DNA vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies which are strongly associated with recovery from natural SARS infection [13] as well as cellular immune responses that may be an important component of SARS immunity. The neutralization activity was detected by a sensitive pseudotyped lentiviral assay, but not by a less sensitive microneutralization plaque-reduction assay. Because the SARS CoV has been contained by careful surveillance and other public health measures, licensure of such a vaccine is likely to require use of the animal rule in models that reflect the pathogenesis in humans, and the identification and validation of immune correlates.
