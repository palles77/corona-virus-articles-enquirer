In this paper, we present a new method for analyzing protein sequence similarity. We calculated the spectral radii of 20 amino acids (AAs) and put forward a novel 2-D graphical representation of protein sequences. To characterize protein sequences numerically, three groups of features were extracted and related to statistical, dynamics measurements and fluctuation complexity of the sequences. With the obtained feature vector, two models utilizing Gaussian Kernel similarity and Cosine similarity were built to measure the similarity between sequences. We applied our method to analyze the similarities/dissimilarities of four data sets. Both proposed models received consistent results with improvements when compared to that obtained by the ClustalW analysis. The novel approach we present in this study may therefore benefit protein research in medical and scientific fields.",

With the repre-sentation of a protein sequence, there are mainly two types of alignment-free methods: (1) digital-signal-based representation and (2) graphical representation. The digital-signal-based representation encodes a single amino acid (AA) into a number so that a protein sequence is converted into a digital signal sequence, which is processed by digital signal analysis tools to extract the features of the protein sequence. For example, in a study performed by Hou et al. (2017) , protein sequence was converted into numerical sequences with their physicochemical properties to achieve the power spectra by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Furthermore, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) was used to extend the spectra to the same length in order to calculate the distance between different sequences. Su and Bao (2013) proposed a method based on Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to measure protein sequence similarity. The model employed only the approximation coefficients of DTW so that the feature vector was short enough to bring a great running time promotion.",

It represents a protein sequence graphically and then extracts feature vector of the graph. Various approaches on graphical representation were proposed according to the physicochemical properties of the AAs. Some methods converted an AA to a discrete point according to its physicochemical properties , and some methods mapped an AA to a unique value by principle components of physicochemical properties ( Wang et al., 2014 ) . Zhang et al. (2015) put forward a 2-D graphical representation by converting each AA to a point according to the hydrophobicity and hydropathy indexes. Then the cumulative distance of every point was utilized to present the distance of the sequences. In addition, similar approaches have been proposed by several studies Qi and Jin, 2016 ) . Furthermore, several graphical representations of protein sequences have applied reduced protein models ( Li et al., 2009; Randi \u0107 et al., 2009 ) . Yao et al. (2014c) simplified twenty AAs into four types with preset values according to hydrophobicity. Four consecutive numbers were summed as the amplitudes of vertical axis. Thus, a protein sequence can be characterized by a 17-D vector containing the frequencies of the amplitudes. Based on the idea of cyclic order of 20 AAs, Ellakkani and Mahran (2015) selected twenty concentric evenly spaced circles divided by n radial lines into equal divisions to represent any protein sequence of length n . The mean of each two successive distances between each two successive AAs was calculated. The set of the different mean distances with its frequencies was taken as a mathematical descriptor. The graph-energy-based methods are also effective graphical representation . Wu et al. (2015) calculated the graph energy and Laplacian energy of 20 AAs by the codons of the AAs, and applied them to a novel 2-D graphical representation of proteins to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of protein sequences.",

The static features of the protein sequence included the mean of spectral radii (MSR), distribution of spectral radii (DSR) and distribution of functional groups (DFG). The dynamics features of the protein sequence included distribution of spectral radii transitions (DSRT), distribution of functional groups transitions (DFGT). The non-linear feature was fluctuation complexity ( C f ). With the mathematical characterization, two models adopting Gaussian Kernel similarity and Cosine similarity were built to analyze the similarities among nine NADH5 (ND5), thirty-five Coronavirus Spike Proteins (CoVPs), twenty-four transferrin proteins (TFs) and twenty-seven antifreeze protein sequences (AFPs). Our results were consistent with improvements when compared to that achieved by the ClustalW.

In the model called PROTNN, a rich set of structural and topological attributes including spectral radius were extracted to classify protein structures ( Dhifli and Diallo, 2016 ) . A metric called the spectral radius ratio was defined as the ratio of the spectral radius to the average node degree in order to measure the variation in node degree for complex network graphs ( Meghanathan, 2014 ) . All the previous researches indicated that spectral radius was an effective metric. Thus, the spectral radius was adopted to model the protein sequence. G = (V, E) was set to be a graph possessing n vertices and m edges, with the set of vertices V = { v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v n } and the edges set E = { e 1 , e 2 , . . . , e m } . An adjacency matrix",

Four nucleotides i.e., A,G,C,T were mapped to four unit vectors with different directions, respectively. An AA was mapped to a graph by a walking method to connect the codons of the specified AA. The walking method is described briefly as follows. The walker began to walk from (0, 0). If the following nucleotide in the codons was the same with the current one, the walker would not change the walking direction and only add the value of edges by one. Otherwise, the walker would change the walking direction according to the direction of the nucleotide. Thus, the nucleotides were connected together to form a graph. Then the graph was transformed to an undirected graph. In the graph, the value of the edge denoted the walking times. The graphs of 20 AAs are shown in Figure S1 in supplementary materials. \u2022 After getting the graphs of 20 AAs, the adjacency matrices of the graphs were established to calculate the eigenvalues. Thus, the spectral radii of 20 AAs were calculated according to (2) and the result is shown in Table 1 .",

To illustrate the proposed sim-ilarities/dissimilarities models, the similarities of nine ND5 protein sequences across nine species were analyzed. We calculated the distances by Gaussian Kernel similarity and Cosine similarity, ( Tables 2 and 3 , respectively), which were then compared to the analysis achieved by the ClustalW ( Table 4 ) in order to validate its effectiveness. The corresponding phylogenetic trees ( Fig. 2 ) showed that Gaussian Kernel similarity analysis is consistent with that of the ClustalW, while Cosine similarity analysis is closely consistent with that of the ClustalW.",
