The present experiments examined the effects of deprivation and supplementation of extracellular L-ascorbate on the activity of this transport system. Initial rates of L-ascorbate uptake were measured by incubating primary cultures of rat astrocytes with L-[14C]ascorbate for 1 min at 37~ We observed that the apparent maximal rate of uptake (Vm~x) increased rapidly (<1 h) when cultured cells were deprived of Lascorbate. In contrast, there was no change in the apparent affinity of the transport system for C-[14C]ascorbate. The increase in V~,,,: was reversed by addition of L-ascorbate, but not D-isoascorbate, to the medium. The effects of external ascorbate on ascorbate transport activity were specific in that preincubation of cultures with L-ascorbate did not affect uptake of 2-deoxy-D-pH(G)]glucose. We conclude that the astroglial ascorbate transport system is modulated by changes in substrate availability. Regulation of transport activity may play a role in intracellular ascorbate homeostasis by compensating for regional differences and temporaI fluctuations in external ascorbate levels.",

            "text": "Experiments with cortical slices and freshly dissociated tissue have shown that brain cells actively transport ascorbate (16, 17, 18) . Cultured brain cells are usually grown in media that are virtually free of ascorbate. This is true even for serum-supplemented media because the vitamin is not detectable (<0.5 Ixg/ml) in the commercially available sera commonly used for cell culture (19) . Ascorbate is not synthesized by rodent brain cells and is not detectable in either astrocytes or neurons cultured in medium from which the vitamin is absent (20) . However, our previous studies showed that type-1 astrocytes of rat and mouse brains possess a specific, high-affinity, Na+-ascorbate cotransport system in their plasma membrane (21, 22) . Uptake of L-ascorbate by astrocytes was found to be: i) saturable, stereoselective, temperatureand Na+-dependent; ii) specific for the vitamin since it was not diminished in the presence of other organic anions including acetate, formate, lactate, malonate, oxalate, p-aminohippurate, pyruvate and succinate; iii) lacking a specific requirement for external CI-; and iv) rapidly (_< 1 min) and reversibly inhibited by furosemide, 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS) and 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS). Rapid and reversible inhibition by the impermeant antagonists, SITS and DIDSa localized the transporter to the plasma membrane. The apparent affinity of the transporter for L-ascorbate was in the micromolar range in astrocytes incubated with a physiological concentration of extracellular Na +, indicating a high-affinity L-ascorbate transporter. However, the affinity for L-ascorbate was significantly decreased when the extracellular Na + concentration was lowered, consistent with Na+-ascorbate cotransport. Efflux proceeded much more slowly than uptake under our experimental conditions. There is evidence that the transport system is subject to regulation, since prolonged (> 1 week) exposure to dibutyryl cyclic AMP increased the apparent maximal transport rate (Vm=) of L-ascorbate in astrocytes (21, 22) .",

Regulation of ascorbate transport rates is a plausible mechanism for controlling intracellular ascorbate concentrations in the face of a constantly changing extracellular supply. The results of previous in vivo studies are consistent with regulation of vitamin C transport by external ascorbate levels, i) In guinea pigs, which cannot synthesize ascorbate, ascorbate-deficient diets lead to a prolonged half-life of vitamin C in brain (13) . ii) Ingestion of excess vitamin C by guinea pigs slowly changes intestinal ascorbate transport with the result that initial uptake rates are decreased (30, 31) . For example, the apparent Vm~ of Na+-dependent ascorbate uptake in ileum was 32% lower in animals fed an ascorbate-enriched ration for 14 days, compared with controls fed a maintenance ration (31) . These data from long-term whole-animal experiments suggested that autoregulation of ascorbate transport may occur in cerebral and intestinal tissue, but did not provide information about cellular mechanisms. For example, apparent downregulation might have resulted from altered transport rates but also from altered catabolism of ascorbate, systemic compensations or nonspecific toxic effects. In particular, in vivo experiments did not determine if highaffinity, Na+-dependent ascorbate transport could be altered by changes in substrate availability.",

The decrease in astroglial vitamin C transport activity induced by external ascorbate is also stereoselective. Whereas 30 p~M L-ascorbate and 300 ~M m-isoascorbate were equally effective in competitively blocking h-[14C]ascorbate uptake when either of the unlabeled analogs was added to the medium at the same time as the radiolabeled vitamin (21) , the present experiments found that preincubation with 30 ~zM L-ascorbate was significantly more effective than 300 txM D-isoascorbate in reducing subsequent L-[14C]ascorbate uptake. These data suggest that interaction of ligand with the external face of the ascorbate transporter is not, of itself, sufficient to modulate transport activity. More importantly, the data show that this effect does not arise from nonspecific damage by extracellular reductant.

Maintenance of various cell types in the absence of D-glucose has been shown to increase the apparent Vm~,, for hexose transport with no change in the apparent Km (37) . Glucose deprivation of primary rat brain astroglial cells for 2-12 h gives rise to an increase in glucose transport activity as well as in the amount of glucose transporter protein and mRNA (38) . Half-maximal induction of glucose transport activity occurs by 2-3 h and the maximal increase in the glucose transport activity is observed within 12 h of transferring glucose-replete astroglial cells to a nominally glucose-free medium (38) . Longer periods of starvation may be less effective, since Hara et al. (39) reported that glucose starvation for 40-65 h does not change subsequent 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake activity in cultured rat astrocytes. Dissociated cells from rat brain show accelerative exchange of 2-deoxy-I>glucose (i.e. transstimulation of transport). When these cells are preincubated for 20 rain in the presence of various concentrations of unlabeled 2-deoxyglucose or 3-O-methylglucose, so as to increase intracellular sugar concentrations, the subsequent rate of 2-deoxy-m-[3H(G)]glucose uptake is enhanced (40) . No evidence for accelerative exchange was found in our experiments with astroglial ascorbate transport. Na+-dependent ascorbate transport has a much higher affinity (apparent Km = 17-21 IxM ascorbate; present experiments) than does Na+-independent hexose transport (apparent K m = 360 ~M for 2-deoxyglucose; 41) by similar rat astroglial cultures. Na+-dependent plasma membrane transport systems which are modulated by external substrate deprivation include: i) Na+-glucose cotransport activity in enterocytes which increases during glucose deprivation (42) ; ii) Na+-amino acid cotransport in fibroblasts, hepatocytes and C6 glioma cells which increases during amino acid deprivation (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) ; iii) Na+-phosphate cotransport in several cell types which increases during phosphate deprivation (49) . In these three cases, Na +dependent substrate uptake responds to substrate deprivation (i.e. exposure to substrate-free medium) with an increase in Vm~,, but without change in Km. In some cases, stimulation of transport requires gene transcription and protein synthesis (48, 49) . However, amino acid deprivation of <1 h can increase cellular amino acid transport activity through kinetic regulation (release from transinhibition) that does not require protein synthesis (44) (45) (46) (47) . The mechanism underlying the stimulation of astroglial ascorbate Vm~x by vitamin C deprivation has not yet been determined, but may involve: i) changed kinetic properties of transporters, affecting Vma,~ but not Km (e.g. release from transinhibition), or ii) an increased number of functional transporters due to slowed degradation of existing transporters, activation of nonfunctional (cryptic) transporters, redistribution of transporters from an intraceIlular compartment to the plasma membrane, or synthesis of transporters de novo. However, synthesis of new transporters seems unlikely in view of the rapidity of the change in ascorbate transport rate folIowing a change in external ascorbate concentration. Under physiological conditions, ascorbate is an important reducing agent (50) . Therefore, \"adaptation\" to vitamin C deprivation may involve an aIteration in intracellular redox state (51) with subsequent effects on the transport process.",

For example, extracellular ascorbate concentration in rat striatum varies according to a circadian pattern, with a rise during the nocturnal increase in motor activity (52) . Additionally, more rapid changes in rat striatal ascorbate can be observed following tail-pinch (53) . Extracellular ascorbate levels also differ between brain regions. For example, extracellular ascorbate concentrations in the white matter of the corpus callosum are higher than in adjacent areas of grey matter (striatum and cortex; 54). Additionally, amphet-amine-induced increases in extracellular ascorbate concentration are greater in the caudate than in the nucleus accumbens of rat brain (55) . These reports indicate large temporal and regional variations in extracellular ascorbate concentration. Our data are consistent with a transport system that plays a role in regulating intracellular ascorbate levels, because changes in transport activity may compensate for fluctuations in extracellular ascorbate concentration.",
