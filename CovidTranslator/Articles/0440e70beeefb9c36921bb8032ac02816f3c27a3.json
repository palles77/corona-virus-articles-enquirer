            "text": "The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of diarrheic infections during the early postnatal phase of calves on the concentrations of hormones controlling reproduction and metabolism. Blood samples were collected from 20 male and female calves via jugular vein catheters every 15 min for 6 hr at Days 3, 9, and 21 of life. The animals were classified into three groups. Group 1 (controls): healthy calves (n \u03ed 9). Group 2: calves affected with diarrhea at Day 9 (n \u03ed 7). Group 3: calves with diarrhea at Days 3 and 9 (n \u03ed 4). Infections occurred spontaneously and were mainly due to E. coli infections. All affected calves had recovered at Day 21. Mean GH concentrations in the calves in Groups 2 and 3 compared to control calves had increased by Day 3 (P \u03fd 0.01; P \u03fd 0.001). Cortisol levels of calves in all groups were highest at Day 3 and decreased thereafter (P \u03fd 0.001). Cortisol concentrations were lower at Day 3 in animals in Groups 2 (P \u03fd 0.001) and 3 (P \u03fd 0.05) than in controls. Pulsatile LH release was detectable at Days 9 and 21 only in healthy calves. Insulin increased at Day 9 during diarrhea. The results indicate that cortisol concentrations decreased whereas GH concentrations were increased before diarrhea was observed. The onset of pulsatile LH release was delayed in diarrheic calves. It is concluded that diarrhea exerts effects upon the release of reproductive and metabolic hormones in early postnatal calves.",

The early postnatal time is a period of dramatic changes. In particular, the gastrointestinal tract is suddenly being responsible for nutrient absorption. The intestine is the most rapidly developing tissue during this time [1] . In the initial first few days, transport from lumen of the gut to the animal's blood stream is facilitated by a high permeability of the gut. The permeability is later decreased, which may protect from bacterial infection.",

The perinatal cortisol concentrations represent the maximum levels observed throughout the entire life span. Glucocorticoids involved in metabolic control play an important role in the development of tissues and organs in the neonatal calf [2] . The very high cortisol levels observed up to 1 wk after birth may facilitate absorption of IgG [3] . GH receptors have been demonstrated in fetal human gut tissue from Week 20 of pregnancy [4] . The high level of growth hormone is thought to mediate its biologic effect via the specific GH receptors that stimulate the proliferation of crypt cells [5] . Thus, particularly the high concentration of GH may be important for the development and the function of the digestive tract.",

Because retrospective surveys attempting to determine the relative importance of various stressors have characteristically identified aberrations of intestinal function as a major causative factor, an understanding of factors mediating postnatal growth and development of the gastrointestinal tract is essential [1] . Further, the economic loss due to diarrhea that are cured are substantial because the disease interferes with growth. However, the effect of diarrhea on hormonal regulation of gut development and gonadal maturation has so far only received limited attention. We therefore aimed to characterize the alterations of GH, cortisol, and LH concentrations in young calves affected with clinical diarrhea. We further included insulin levels in the study as a measure of the metabolic status of the calves.",

Cortisol was quantified after sample extraction with tertiary-butylmethyl ether [7] . The cortisol antibody used (code \"HCo-21-HS; S16; 9.1.84\") was raised in rabbits against cortisol-21-hemisuccinat-BSA. Cross-reactivities are as follows: cortisol: 100%, pregnenolone \u03fd 1%, corticosterone 15%, DOC 19%, progesterone 7.5%. The cortisol antibody dilution was 1 : 165,000. LH was measured by an EIA according to Mutayoba et al. [8] with some modifications. The monoclonal antibody to LH generated against bovine LH (bLH, Lot 10/518b 7 ) was a characterized by Matteri et al. [9] . As a tracer, 40 g USDA-bLH-B5 (AFP5500) was biotinylated as previously described [8] . Microtiter plates (96 well Easy Wash, Corning, NY, USA) were coated with antibodies raised against mouse IgG in sheep. Antibodies were precipitated [10] and used in a concentration of 1 g/100 l carbonate buffer (0.05 M NaHCO 3 , pH 9.6) per well. After 24 hr of incubation at 4\u00b0C the plates were blocked with 300 l 2.5% casein in 0.05 M NaOH (adjusted to pH 7.2 with HCl) at room temperature for 2 hr. The plates were washed four times with 300 l 0.05% Tween 20 in 10% PBS. The air-dried plates were stored at \u03ea20\u00b0C for up to 12 wk without appreciable loss of binding capacity. Standard (USDA-bLH-B-5) or plasma samples (50 l) were pipetted into the wells and 100 l monoclonal LH antibody (1 ng/ml) in assay buffer (0.1% hydrolyzed gelatin, 0.12 M NaCl, 0.02 M Na 2 HPO 4 , 0.01 M EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.005% chlorhexidine digluconate (20%), 0.002% phenol red and 5% bull plasma containing less than 0.1 ng LH/ml). After incubation at room temperature for 20 h plates were washed twice and 100 l of tracer (5 ng/ml assay buffer) was added. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After two washing steps, 100 l of a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) solution (200 ng/ml assay buffer) were added per well. The further assay steps are comparable to Mutayoba et al. [8] . The minimum detectable level was 0.1 ng bLH/ml plasma. Cross-reactions with ovine FSH, bovine prolactin, bovine growth hormone were less than 0.1% and 0.5% with bovine TSH. Serial dilutions of bull plasma were parallel to the standard curve and the recovery of added hormone to plasma samples in the EIA was 102 \u03ee 7%. Concentrations of insulin were determined by a commercially available RIA-kit (CIS Diagnostik GmbH, Dreieich, Germany). Coefficients of variation within and between assays were as follows: GH 10% and 12%, cortisol 6% and 10%, LH 9% and 11%, and insulin 10% and 13%.",

            "text": "Within the first three weeks of life, blood plasma concentrations of GH were initially high and then decreased in healthy calves. This is comparable to the findings of Ronge and Blum [13] who described that in new-born calves GH concentrations tended to decrease during the first five weeks of life. The high concentrations of GH may have a comparable action a) on the increase in the depth of crypts and b) on the rate of proliferation of the villi of the gut [14] . In this study GH concentrations were elevated before symptoms of diarrhea could be observed. We consider it most likely that subclinical stages of infection have started to affect GH concentrations before clinical symptoms become apparent. Diarrhea was the clinical sign or symptom of the presence of the underlying infection. The host response to the infection organism establishes the water balance perturbations that result in diarrhea. It has to be taken into account that some aspects of dehydration associated with the loss of water can compromise the interpretation of how plasma concentrations of hormones change during this process, largely because the majority of the water entering the bowl comes from the plasma compartment and the concentrations can therefore be different. Calves in Group 2 had markedly higher plasma concentrations of GH at Day 3. These calves had diarrhea six days later. Calves in Group 3 that already had diarrhea showed an even more pronounced increase in plasma concentrations of GH at Day 3. Comparable to the results of the present study is the finding that endotoxin administration increased GH concentrations in sheep [15] , in finishing gilts [16] , and in humans [17] . Short-term GH treatments can ameliorate some of the symptoms of the acute phase response to endotoxemia [18] . The increase in GH concentrations before any clinical signs of diarrhea were observed may be interpreted as an induction of the body's defense system. Higher concentrations of GH result in a lower permeability of the gut [19] ; consequently the transportation of endotoxin from the lumen of the gut into the blood circulation may be reduced and inflammation reactions may be decreased [19] . In contrast to the typical actions of GH that are mediated by IGF, GH can also act directly on gut tissue via specific receptors even when serum IGF-1 is suppressed, as reported for infected animals [20] . The increase in GH concentration suggests that GH may play-in addition to its well-known role as a regulator of growth and immune function-an important role in intestinal healing in early postnatal calves.",

Cortisol may vary extensively [24, 25] , but there is indication that concentrations are high after birth and decrease during the first week of life in ruminants. The number of leukocytes, glucose concentrations and the weight gains increase in accordance with the concentrations of cortisol [26] . The results of the current work indicate that even before calves suffered from clinically apparent diarrhea, cortisol concentrations were decreased. Although the possibility exists that the calves of Group 2 and 3 had a low cortisol level at birth, which in turn may have induced a lower absorption of IgG [27] and a lower resistance to diarrhea, we have no data to support this. However, our results, taken together with those of other research workers [3] , lead to the speculation that glucocorticoid concentrations increase to a peak around the time of onset of labor and then decline [28] . Thus, any delay in the birth process could result in lower glucocorticoid concentrations at the time of delivery, and perhaps a subsequent decrease in the ability of the calf to absorb colostral immunoglobulins. Therefore, it may be speculated that those calves that had low concentrations of cortisol had a higher susceptibility to diarrhea because their passage rate of IgG out of the colostrum into the blood circulation was diminished. However, it is well known that cortisol may modulate susceptibility by mechanisms involving systems other than just IgG passage rate.",

Stressors inducing a rise of cortisol concentration may cause a decrease in LH concentration via down-regulating the sensitivity of the adenopituitary toward GnRH in adult cattle, but in new-born cattle the pituitary is more likely to be influenced by opioids [34] . Therefore, it may be concluded that the low basal concentration of LH is not modified by early postnatal diarrhea. However, the delayed onset in LH pulses may result in delayed gonadal development, because in bull calves the early increase in pulsatile LH release is critical for initiation of reproductive performance [35] .",

However, after E. coli endotoxin treatment increased insulin concentrations were reported [29] that correspond with the results of the present study in which mainly E. coli and only one case with corona-and rotavirus infection was observed. This might be the reason that only slight effects of diarrhea on the concentration of insulin were observed in the present study. However, there was always a distinct stimulating effect on blood plasma concentrations of insulin after feeding the calves in the morning one hour before the start of the blood sampling intervals.",

Increased GH concentrations that are evident even before the clinical appearance of infections may be contribute to lower permeability of the gut for infectious agents. GH may therefore play an important role in activating the body's defenses against diarrheic infections and, additionally in intestinal healing. In diarrheic calves the onset of pulsatile LH release was delayed. In conclusion, even mild diarrhea alters the concentration of reproductive and metabolic hormones in early postnatal calves. Whether the observed disturbances might have consequences for reproductive performance and growth remains to be investigated. cortisol antibody, E La\u2424 for her technical assistance, and the staff of the research station Karkendamm for the care and the management of the animals.",
