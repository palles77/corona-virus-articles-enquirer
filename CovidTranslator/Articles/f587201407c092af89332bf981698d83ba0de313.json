            "text": "An immunohistological study of L3T4(CD4)+ and LYT-2(CD8)+ lymphocytes, Mac-1 (CD 11 b)+ monocytes and granulocytes in experimental murine cryptococcal meningoencephalitis was conducted. To assess the concomitant inflammatory reaction in an extracerebral site, livers were examined in parallel. Mice were infected i.v. with Cryptococcus neoformans, group A/D, and organs were examined immunohistologically for CD4-, CD8-and monocyteand granulocyte-specific CD1 lb-phenotypic leukocytes over a period of 60 days. Intracerebrally, agglomerations of cryptococci formed pseudocysts that were surrounded by CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes at the end of the second week post-infection, followed by the invasion of monocytes and granulocytes into the lesions. After the fourth week post-infection, most of the invaded lesions were transformed into glious scars. Meningitis was usually marked and showed a homogenous distribution of CD4-, CD8-and CD 11 b-phenotypic cells, with a predominance of monocytes and CD4+ lymphocytes. Inflammatory infiltrates in the liver were found already 4 days post-infection. CD4+ lymphocytes and monocytes were distributed homogenously in the infiltrates, with a lower number of CD8+ lymphocytes being located rather in the periphery of the infiltrates. Comparing leukocyte kinetics in brain and liver, an important observation was the delayed immigration of immune cells at the intracerebral cryptococcal lesions as compared with the liver, and the different migration patterns of T-lymphocyte subgroups and macrophages. These results suggest that there are differential leukocyte migration patterns in the liver and brain following disseminated cryptococcosis. The immunological aspects of the observed leukocyte kinetics are discussed.",

            "text": "The ubiquitous yeast Cryptococcus neoformans is an important pathogen predominantly in patients with impaired T-cell-dependent immunity, e.g. in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Infection usually occurs via the aerogenic route. If the host is unable to clear the primary pulmonary infection, the fungi disseminate systemically, and meningoencephalitis commonly evolves as the predominant clinical presentation. Meningitis is the most common presentation of cryptococcal brain infection, concurrent intracerebral cryptococcomata are found in less than 10% of cases with cryptococcal meningitis [1 ] . In patients with cryptococcal meningitis, underlying immunocompromising disorders are found much more frequently than in patients with cryptococcomata [2] . While the infection of the brain and meninges dominates the outcome of generalized cryptococcosis [3] , involvement of the liver usually remains clinically asymptomatic [4] . However, the inflammatory reaction in the liver seems to be representative for the clearance of the fungi from extracerebral sites in the host [5] .",

However, experimental studies of myelomonocytic recruitment after injection of lipopolysaccharide into the brain and other organs showed a delayed entry of lymphocytes and monocytes into the brain parenchyma, thus suggesting a nonspecific 'protection' of the brain against the potentially damaging invasion of inflammatory cells [28] . However, by far not all pathogens predominantly cleared from the host by T-cell-dependent phagocyte activity have a predilection for the brain. A better understanding of the pathogenesis ofcryptococcal meningoencephalitis will presumably require further research on the -probably inhibitory-interaction of cryptococcal capsular material and local components of the blood-brain-barrier, e.g. endothelial adhesion molecules [29] [30] [31] . Recent in-vitro studies [32] indicate a faster migration of activated CD4+ lymphocytes across the brain endothelium compared to CD8+ lymphocytes. Our observations indicate a possible in-vivo relevance of these findings.",

Other than in the liver, we could not find a different distribution of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in cryptococcal brain lesions. Since our experiments consisted of the sequentional immunohistological observation of inflammatory reactions against infection with a defined pathogen, conclusions on immunological mechanisms must be drawn with caution. However, our observations suggest that in fully immunocompetent mice, CD4+ (and CD8+) lymphocytes together with CD1 lb+ monocytes constitute the successful local cellular immune reaction in the brain in disseminated cryptococcosis. The kinetics of our immunohistological results correspond well with the hypothesis of Huffnagle and co-workers [12] that CD4+ T cellsin contrast to CDS+ T cells -may be more important in recruiting and activating effector cells to eliminate cryptococci that have disseminated to nonreticuloendothelial organs of the body such as the brain. Interestingly, immunohistological studies on viral meningoencephalitis showed a striking predominance of CD8+ lymphocytes in intracerebral inflammatory lesions [33, 34] .",

Immunohistological studies may provide important informations. In murine listeriosis, another well studied animal model of an infection with a facultatively intracellular pathogen, it could be demonstrated by depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes that attraction of blood-borne Cd 11 b-phenotypic monocytes into liver granulomatous infiltrates is a function of CD4+ lymphocytes in vivo [7] . However, depletion experiments in murine cryptococcosis [11, 12, 35] showed that both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes alone are able to elicit a strong cellular inflammatory response in the lungs of mice infected with C. neoformans via the aerogenous route. The infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ cells into the liver and brain of infected mice provide additional support to these findings. Similarly, depletion experiments showed that CD8+ cells are essential for the generation of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) in murine cryptococcosis [36] . Moreover, induction of DTH against C. neoforrnans in mice by immunization with live or heat-killed cryptococ- neoformans. Sections are from different parts of the brain, thus resulting in different parenchymal background patterns. The Control shows ci was found to be associated with better protection against secondary infection with the fungus, although no histological differences in pathology of the internal organs between immunized and unimmunized mice could be demonstrated [10] . These works, with the exception of a recent publication by Hill and Aguirre [37] , focused on the importance of local immunity in the lungs against dissemination of the fungus to extrapulmonary sites. In contrast, our intention was to describe the extrapulmonary leukocyte migration pattern in disseminated cryptococcosis by differentiating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte and monocytes in the brain and liver.",
