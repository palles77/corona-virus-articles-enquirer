            "text": "As wild cheetah populations continue to decline, captive populations in zoological institutions, breeding and conservation centers grow in importance. Though similar in many aspects to other species in the felid family, cheetahs exhibit unique adaptations that can make their captive care more challenging. They are more susceptible to stress induced diseases than other species (Chapter 25), and in particular captive cheetahs appear to be more susceptible to infectious diseases, some of which was initially attributed to their lack of genetic variability (Heeney et al., 1990; Munson et al., 2005; O'Brien et al., 1985; Chapters 6 and 25) . Management requires a comprehensive program to maintain a healthy population of captive cheetahs, including veterinary care, nutrition, housing, exercise, and enrichment. Initial information can be found through the cheetah Animal Care Manual. The manual, published by the cheetah Species Survival Plan \u00ae (SSP) and the North American captive cheetah specialists, provides general guidelines for the care of cheetahs, and has been shared with the international cheetah community. These guidelines may need to be adjusted based on each institution's local and regional needs. This chapter covers the aspects of housing, stress management, restraint/handling, anesthesia, preventative medicine (including vaccination, health examinations, preshipment and quarantine examinations, and diagnostics), necropsy, and cub care. Protocols and forms that are relevant to this chapter can be found at https:// www.elsevier.com/books-and-journals/bookcompanion/9780128040881.",

Size, barriers, substrate, shelter, transfer chutes, training, and animal management should be carefully considered. How a facility is built and what management practices are undertaken, should depend on the social groupings (single or in groups) and purpose (breeding, display, ambassador) of the cheetahs to be housed in it. Facilities should incorporate enclosures for isolation or separation, as well as having some yards interconnected to allow for ease of transfer. It is also recommended to have a chute or restraint cage so that individuals can be safely handled for procedures without the need for anesthesia (Ziegler-Meeks, 2009 ). By taking into account management challenges and risk factors, such as disease transmission, fence-line aggression, and ability to separate groups into their housing needs, the well-being and health of captive cheetahs can be greatly improved .",

Proper ventilation is also needed to prevent accumulation of substances like ammonia from urine, which can result in respiratory problems (Ziegler-Meeks, 2009 ). The SSP recommends that cheetahs should not be confined indoors, unless it is necessary for medical management or due to inclement weather conditions. Outdoor enclosures for all cheetahs should be as large as possible. The SSP guidelines recommend a minimum enclosure size of \u223c750 m 2 for up to 2 cheetahs.",

However, they have been reported to climb over 3 m of solid wall when no overhang was present (Marker and Schumann 1998) , and they are good climbers when immature and are able to jump over a 3.5-m moat (Ziegler-Meeks, 2009 ). To prevent an escape, a fence made of either solid vertical walls or wire mesh should be at least 2.5 m tall with an additional 60 cm mesh overhang into the enclosure at a 45-degree angle. Overhangs are a critical part of containment and should be made of chain-link or wire mesh. Strands of wire, barbed wire, or hot wire should not be used for the overhang, as cheetahs can easily go through these and get injured in the process (Cheetah SSP manual, in preparation) . Fences should be sunk around the perimeter and corners should not be tighter than 90 degrees or contain small spaces that facilitate climbing. If needed, electrified wire can be used as a supplemental deterrent to climbing.",

Because cheetahs exhibit a high degree of mate selection (Chapters 9 and 27), facilities need to be able to hold a large number of potential breeding animals (four to six females and at least two groups of males) and be subdivided into multiple interconnected enclosures, to increase the chances of reproductive success (Bertschinger et al., 2008; Wielebnowski et al., 2002; Ziegler-Meeks, 2009 ). Cheetahs used for breeding purposes are currently not recommended to be used concurrently as educational program animals (ambassador cats). The SSP guidelines recommend that all males be maintained in their natural sibling coalitions to improve reproductive success, as well as maintain strong, healthy coalition bonds. Alternatively, captive male cheetahs can be successfully introduced at a young age, to form stable coalitions that simulate natural social groupings of wild male cheetahs (Chadwick et al., 2013; Chapter 27) . Koester et al. (2015) reported improved testis function and more normal, motile spermatozoa and androgen production in males held in coalitions compared to those held singly.",

Many factors, including exhibit design, animal movements, exercise, and enrichment, need to be addressed to minimize stress. Cheetah exhibits should be located far from potential sources of stress, such as other large carnivores (e.g., lions, hyenas), and should be designed to encourage natural behavior. Limiting the need for animal handling, particularly during breeding situations, decreases acute stresses. exercise is crucial for cheetahs, and should be facilitated through sufficient enclosure size, as well as a lure course system within the enclosure. Mechanical lure coursing equipment pulls a lure (such as a rag, feathers, or meat treat) quickly (80 kph) around the area. The running provides enrichment and health opportunities for the animals. Other enrichment opportunities, such as providing meat on the bone or carcasses (Chapter 26), novel scents and 'safe' toys, and climbing structures, should be provided for the well-being of the cheetah.",

Protocols that include tiletamine-zolazepam, whether in combination with an \u03b12 agonist or on its own, are often associated with prolonged recoveries and hypertension. However, these protocols are useful when small volumes of anesthetic drugs are needed (e.g., for darting). Several fully reversible anesthetic protocols have also been reported using \u03b12 agonists, such as medetomidine or dexmedetomidine in combination with butorphanol and midazolam (Table 24 .1). These protocols provide a fast onset of anesthesia, good muscle relaxation and rapid recovery; however, sudden arousals can be observed at the reported dosages and total injection volume can become large. varying degrees of hypertension have been observed with \u03b12 agonist combinations (LaFortune et al., 2005; Woc Colburn et al., 2017) .",

While poikilothermia has been reported in the past (Button et al., 1981) , these reports are from a time when alfaxalone was combined with alphadolone and cremophor eL as solvents, as opposed to the current combination of alfaxalone and cyclodextran in water as the solvent (Goodchild et al., 2015) . Intravenous propofol-fentanyl protocols have also been reported in the cheetah. These protocols produced rapid induction and stable cardiorespiratory parameters and wore off 15-20 min from induction. Anesthesia can readily be maintained by gas inhalant anesthesia, such as isoflurane. Maintenance of anesthesia with propofol-fentanyl via total intravenous anesthesia is not recommended in cheetahs because, as in domestic cats, it can produce prolonged anesthetic recoveries and episodes of apnea (Woc Colburn et al., 2009 ).

Lower heart rates are seen with \u03b12 agonists, such as medetomidine and dexmedetomidine. Lower respiratory rates are observed with respiratory depressant anesthetics, such as butorphanol and propofol. Body temperature should be monitored closely. If hyperthermia (>40\u00b0C/104\u00b0F) is present, the body should be cooled down in a controlled manner to prevent a rapid drop of body temperature.

Feces should be (Gaffney et al., 2012) should be performed. Screening tests should be performed by a standardized laboratory that is familiar with analyzing sera and fecal samples from non-domestic species. During the physical examination, attention should be paid to lesions caused by viruses, such as feline calicivirus (FCv) and feline herpesvirus (FHv), as cheetahs are highly susceptible to these viruses. Similarly, given the propensity for a wide variety of hepatic, gastric, and renal diseases, special attention should be given to those organ systems (Chapter 25). The oral cavity should be evaluated for lesions, such as papillomatous plaques under the tongue or oral ulcerations. A thorough dental examination should be conducted. Crowding of incisors and palatal depressions are common in captive and wild cheetahs (Marker and Dickman, 2004; Steenkamp et al., 2017; Chapter 7) . Palatal depressions can become pathological (focal palatine erosion, FPe; Chapter 25); these crypts can get impacted and infected, leading to abscessations and oronasal fistulas. Gently removing the points from the mandibular M1 (using a Dremel or similar tool) prevents further trauma to the crypts. Tooth abrasions and fractures, particularly those of the canine teeth, are commonly found on oral examination in captive cheetahs (Steenkamp and Boy, 2009 ).

The MLv herpes vaccine should not be used in kittens, juveniles, or in those not deemed healthy, as disease may be induced (Citino, unpublished data) . When using the MLv herpes vaccine, there is a potential for shedding of the vaccine strain virus, therefore recently vaccinated cats should only be in proximity (e.g., sharing fence-lines) with 4. CAPTIve CHeeTAHS low-risk cheetahs for approximately 3 weeks after vaccination. A thorough risk-based analysis should be performed prior to making the decision to use modified-live vaccines in cheetahs and precautions to prevent disease transmission to other cheetahs should be taken. vaccinations for FeCov, FeLv, FIv are not recommended at this time. A risk-based analysis should also be performed before deciding to vaccine for the Canine Distemper virus (CDv) at the institution.",

Newer research into renal biomarkers are being conducted in several exotic felids and can potentially be applied to cheetahs.

Prior to the birth of the cubs, a hand-rearing protocol should be in place along with equipment and supplies, in case they are needed. every effort should be made to allow the dam to rear the cubs on her own. However, if illness, maternal neglect, abandonment, or trauma occurs, or if only 1 cub is born, a decision to hand-rear has to be made rapidly. Fostering should always be done for single cubs (when another litter is available) as the single cub does not stimulate the dam enough for adequate milk production.

Cubs with failure of passive transfer of antibodies due to the lack of adequate intake of colostrum, are more susceptible to infectious diseases due to their decreased immunity. If failure of passive transfer is present, a plasma transfusion from the dam or another cheetah may be needed. Plasma can be given to the cubs subcutaneously or by mouth for the first 1-2 weeks to ensure that full amount is received. Approximately 19% of hand-reared cubs do not survive, with a large percentage of deaths occurring before 30 days of age (Lombardi et al., 2009) . Gastrointestinal disorders, pneumonia, and upper respiratory diseases are common causes of mortality with a variety of potential etiologies (Bell, 2005) . To prevent exposure to infectious diseases, hand-rearing should be performed in an isolated room and proper personal protective equipment, such as gloves, gowns, masks, and boots, should be worn. Deworming with pyrantel pamoate should begin at 6 weeks and be administered every 2 weeks until cubs are 16 weeks of age. Facilities in geographic locations that are endemic for heartworm disease (Dirofilaria immitis infection) should start prophylactic heartworm prevention as early as 6 weeks of age, when the first set of vaccines is given.",

(2009) reported that the average growth rate in a healthy hand-reared cheetah cub averaged 48 g/ day. Those that did not survive averaged much lower daily gains (\u223c5 g/day). Mean growth rate was affected by the type of first solid food given, with ground beef having the lowest growth rate. Cheetah milk is lower in carbohydrates than domestic cat milk and milk replacers; therefore Lombardi et al. (2009) recommends diluting commercial milk formula with distilled water to help decrease carbohydrate load and diminish frequency of diarrhea. Formulas, such as Kitten Milk Replacer (KMR) have been used successfully, mixed either at a 1:2 or 1:3 ratio, and lead to higher survival rates than dog formulas (esbilac; Lombardi et al., 2009) . Zoologic formulas 42/52, 33/40, and 30/55 contain less carbohydrates compared to KMR, and are less frequently associated with diarrhea. Different institutions have added supplemental vitamins, protein sources, or have combined milk replacers to bring the milk composition closer to natural cheetah milk, the constituents of which have been well documented (Lombardi et al., 2009) . It is recommended for the first feedings to consist of 5% dextrose mixed with distilled water or pedialyte, and then introduce the formula gradually once cubs are stable and taking several feedings well. Frequency of bottle-feeding depends on the cub's age, and is gradually decreased from every 2 h for newborns to approximately six feedings per day by week 4. Amount of formula usually starts around 10%-12% of body weight per day and is gradually increased to 15%-20%. Feedings greater than 20% have led to loose stool and other gastrointestinal disturbances (Lombardi et al., 2009) . Cheetah cubs should be adequately hydrated to prevent impactions. During feeding, care should be taken to prevent aspiration pneumonia.",
