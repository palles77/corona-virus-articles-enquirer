Several reports have found that the mortality and morbidity of recipients requiring CPB is higher than that of recipients not requiring CPB. [1] [2] [3] One of the reasons for these findings could be that CPB evokes an inflammatory response that leads to organ failure, including respiratory distress syndrome.

In pediatric transplantation most operations are performed with CPB, and good results have been reported. In fact, the Harefield group recommends the routine use of CPB in lung transplantation. 8 Furthermore, Szeto and associates 9 have found that CPB had minimal deleterious effects on graft function in a homogeneous population of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Thus the use of CPB in lung transplantation is controversial. The reason for a lack of consensus is partially due to the fact that clinical studies can be biased because patients who require CPB have more severe disease. In particular, CPB is mostly needed in patients with pulmonary hypertension, and this group of patients has the highest risk of all patients undergoing transplantation. There have been no randomized controlled studies to address the effects of CPB on the outcomes of lung transplantation, and few experimental studies have specifically examined the effects of CPB on graft function.",

            "text": "Theoretically, CPB has potential benefits, such as providing hemodynamic stability during surgical intervention and preventing the sudden increase of pulmonary flow during the reperfusion period. Thus controlling graft flow with CPB might protect the graft from high-pressure reperfusion injury. Halldorsson and coworkers 10, 11 reported that decreasing the reperfusion pressure prevents pulmonary injury in a piglet model. On the other hand, the Pittsburgh group reported that the use of CPB is associated with early graft dysfunction in a canine experiment. 12 Fullerton and colleagues 13 reported that lung transplantation with CPB exaggerates pulmonary vasomotor dysfunction. However, in their experiment the animals were quickly weaned off CPB, and the potential benefit of CPB was not examined. We hypothesized that the effect of CPB on lung function depends on the balance between its deleterious effects caused by an inflammatory response and its beneficial effects caused by decreasing pulmonary flow. To examine the beneficial effects of CPB on graft function, we performed canine single-lung transplantations with CPB, and graft flow was controlled during the early reperfusion period. In addition, we examined whether conventional ultrafiltration (CUF) during CPB attenuates graft dysfunction because it has recently been suggested that ultrafiltration is effective in eliminating the inflammatory mediators responsible for the cytokine syndrome. 14",

Intravenous thiopental sodium (2.5 mg/kg) and pancuronium bromide (0.1 mg/kg) were used to facilitate endotracheal intubation. The animals were ventilated at a tidal volume of 15 mL/kg at a rate of 15 breaths/min by using a volume-limited ventilator (Servo 900B, Siemens-Elmer). Positive end-expiratory pressure was controlled at 5 cm H 2 O; the inspired oxygen fraction was 1.0. Anesthesia was maintained with inhalation of 1% to 2% halothane, and muscular relaxation was obtained with additional pancuronium bromide at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. An arterial line was inserted into the right femoral artery to monitor blood pressure and arterial blood gases. A venous line was inserted into the right femoral vein to allow infusion of solutions. A left thoracotomy was performed at the fifth intercostal space. The left and right pulmonary arteries, pulmonary vein, and left main bronchus were isolated. Sodium heparin (300 U/kg) was administered through the venous line. A purse-string suture with 5-0 Prolene was placed on the proximal site of the left pulmonary artery, and a catheter was inserted. A vascular clamp was placed on the left atrium, and an incision was made for decompression. After left pulmonary artery clamping, the left lung was selectively flushed with cold modified Euro-Collins solution (50 mL/kg). During this period, the lung was ventilated with 100% oxygen. After flushing was completed, the left main bronchus was stapled, leaving the lung well inflated with 100% oxygen. The left lung was then excised and stored in 4\u00b0C Euro-Collins solution until transplantation. During pulmonary artery flushing, donor blood for the recipients' transfusion was collected into packs containing citratephosphate-dextrose solution from the venous line. After harvesting the left lung, the animals were killed by means of an intravenous injection with an overdose of potassium chloride and thiopental sodium.",

A pulmonary artery catheter (5F Swan-Ganz catheter) was placed in the main pulmonary artery With the animals in the right decubitus position, a left thoracotomy was done through the fifth intercostal space. The right pulmonary artery and the right main bronchus were encircled by 1-0 silk strings. Sodium heparin (300 U/kg) was administered systemically, and the activated clotting time was confirmed to be longer than 400 seconds. A catheter was placed into the left atrium through the right accessory pulmonary vein to monitor left atrial pressure (LAP). In group 1 a left pneumonectomy was performed, and then the donor left lung was orthotopically transplanted. In groups 2 and 3 a pediatric arterial cannula was inserted in the distal part of the ascending aorta, and a 2-stage wire-reinforced venous cannula (28F, 38F) was placed in the right atrium by opening the pericardium through a left thoracotomy. The arterial and venous cannulas were connected to the bypass circuits, which consisted of a roller pump, a 2000-mL venous reservoir, 3 \u20448-inch tubing, a 40-m arterial filter, a polystan oxygenator (SAFE MINI, Polycare Ltd), and a heat exchanger. The bypass circuit was primed with 500 mL of lactate Ringer's solution, 20% mannitol, and sodium bicarbonate. CPB was initiated and maintained at a flow rate of 80 to 100 mL/kg for 2 hours, and rectal temperature was maintained at 36\u00b0C. During CPB, the respiration rate was decreased to 6 breaths/min. The left pneumonectomy and lung transplantation were done in the same manner as in group 1. When the animals were weaned off CPB, the CPB flow was decreased slowly so that the newly transplanted lungs were reperfused with a controlled pulmonary artery pressure over a 10-minute period. In all groups transplantation involved about 20 hours of ischemic time. All animals were transfused with donor blood if the hematocrit level decreased to less than 20%. The donor blood was endotoxin free and a negative cross-match. In all groups protamine was administered to neutralize heparin, and the activated clotting time was normalized. After 30 minutes of reperfusion, the native right pulmonary artery and right main bronchus were ligated to ensure dependence on the transplanted lung. The lungs were ventilated with a tidal volume of 15 mL/kg, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H 2 O, and an inspired oxygen fraction of 1.0 at a rate of 20 breaths/min. The skin was closed, and the recipient dogs were observed for 6 hours, during which time aortic pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, CVP, and LAP values were continuously monitored. Measurement of CO, arterial blood gas analysis, and blood sampling was done at 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes after ligation of the right pulmonary artery and the right bronchus. CO was measured by means of the thermodilution technique with a 5-mL bolus injection of 5% glucose at 4\u00b0C. Arterial gas was analyzed with the i-STAT portable clinical analyzer (Heska Corp). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was done twice by means of flexible bronchoscopy, once before transplantation and again 360 minutes after ligation of the right pulmonary artery and the right bronchus. The bronchoscope was wedged in the lingular segment of the left upper lobe. The BAL fluid was collected by flushing the distal airways with 2 \u03eb 10 mL of normal saline and consequent intermittent suctioning. After 6 hours of observation, the animals were killed with an intravenous injection of an overdose of potassium chloride and thiopental sodium.",

However, in animals undergoing transplantation with CPB, the PaO 2 level progressively deteriorated, and significant differences were found among the 3 groups (overall group effect, P \u03ed .001; group 1 vs group 2, P \u03ed .001; group 2 vs group 3, P \u03ed .028). The PaO 2 level of the animals undergoing transplantation with CPB was better with the use of ultrafiltration during the early reperfusion period. The alveolar to arterial gradient for O 2 of the animals undergoing transplantation without CPB was significantly better than that of the animals undergoing transplantation with CPB (overall group effect, P \u03ed .003; group 1 vs group 2, P \u03ed .002; group 2 vs group 3, not significant). The hemodynamic data of the recipients during the 6-hour observation period are shown in Table 2 . All 3 groups had similar mean aortic pressure, CVP, LAP, and CO values. The animals undergoing transplantation with CPB and ultrafiltration had significantly lower mean pulmonary artery pressures than the animals undergoing transplantation without CPB (overall group effect, P \u03ed .012; group 1 vs group 3, P \u03ed .011). Although the P value of the overall group effect for PVR was not significant (P \u03ed .068), the PVR of animals undergoing transplantation with CPB and ultrafiltration was lower than that of animals undergoing transplantation without CPB at 4 and 6 hours after ligation of the right pulmonary artery and bronchus. Regarding aerodynamic parameters, peak airway pressure was essentially the same among the 3 groups.",

[4] [5] [6] At the time of reperfusion, the blood activated by CPB goes into the newly transplanted lung, and reperfusion injury could be more severely accelerated compared with cases in which the blood is not activated. On the other hand, CPB has a beneficial effect in that the transplanted lungs can be reperfused with controlled pulmonary artery pressure. Several studies have demonstrated that decreasing the reperfusion pressure reduces lung injury after lung ischemia. 10, 11 Therefore one could expect that CPB should have beneficial effects by preventing high pulmonary flow during reperfusion of the transplanted lung.",

In previous canine experiments the animals were quickly weaned off CPB, and the potential benefit of CPB was not fully examined. We believe that that the decreasing of the pulmonary pressure in our model ameliorated graft function to some extent. However, our data indicated that even if pulmonary flow was controlled during reperfusion, pulmonary function eventually deteriorated over the 6-hour observation period, and the graft was not permanently protected from the adverse effects of CPB.",

However, a donor/recipient body weight ratio of 1.2 or greater was used in this study. Second, canines are thought to be more susceptible to CPB than human subjects. Third, most of the animals undergoing transplantation with CPB required blood transfusion, whereas the animals undergoing transplantation without CPB did not. This might have accelerated the worsening of graft function. Halldorsson and coworkers 10, 11 reported that controlled reperfusion prevents pulmonary injury after 24 hours of lung preservation. In their experiment white blood cells were depleted through a leukocyte-depleting filter. Bando and associates 17 reported similar results in lung injury associated with CPB. They showed that leukocyte depletion improves lung injury after CPB. In our experiment leukocyte depletion was not ap- plied; this could explain why there was graft dysfunction despite the prevention of high-flow vascular injury. In fact, the changes observed on histology and the MPO assay were not those of simple lung edema but the result of accumulation of PMNs into the alveolar space. These changes are compatible with those found in lungs after cardiac surgery with CPB. 18 It is well known that there is an inflammatory reaction to CPB with neutrophil sequestration in the lungs, contributing to microvascular injury and postoperative pulmonary dysfunction. Therefore in our model reperfusion pulmonary injury of the transplanted lung might have been further enhanced by the adverse effect of CPB.",

            "text": "Recently, ultrafiltration techniques have been shown to improve postoperative respiratory and cardiac functions after heart surgery. Furthermore, ultrafiltration has been investigated as a potential therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome because it removes inflammatory mediators and excess free water. Thus we hypothesized that ultrafiltration could reduce inflammatory mediators and be beneficial for graft function in lung transplantation with CPB. CUF is applied during the rewarming phase of CPB, and modified ultrafiltration (MUF) is performed immediately after cessation of CPB; both methods are used in cardiac surgery. [19] [20] [21] Berdat and associates 20 reported that in pediatric cardiac surgery both CUF and MUF could remove inflammatory mediators. They reported that of the cytokines, IL-6 was removed most effectively and that IL-6 was removed to a greater extent with CUF than with MUF. IL-6 is known to be the key cytokine associated with sequestration of neutrophils in the lung. 22 IL-6 stimulates neutrophilia and thrombopoiesis and induces the synthesis of acute-phase proteins. [22] [23] [24] Sustained increased of IL-6 in the plasma and BAL fluid of patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome have been demonstrated and are negatively correlated with disease outcome and patient survival. 25 In this experiment we used the CUF method. We were not able to show whether the improvement of graft function was brought about by the reduction of IL-6 levels in the present study because the specific cytokine kit for canine IL-6 is not yet commercially available. Therefore instead of measuring serum cytokine levels, we showed that IL-6 mRNA was reduced in canines with ultrafiltration by using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (see Appendix E1 and Figure E1 ). Another possible mechanism by which ultrafiltration could improve graft function might be due to the reduction of adhesion molecules on recipients' blood lymphocytes. It is well known that some adhesion molecules are upregulated during CPB and have been associated with the adverse effects of CPB. 26 Grunenfelder and associates 27 reported that ultrafiltration led to a significant reduction in not only cytokines but also adhesion molecules, such as soluble E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule 1. Both molecules are responsible for the primary adhesion of neutrophils to the endothelium of the vessels. Thus several mechanisms might contribute to the changes observed in grafts treated with CUF. Given our results, further study to determine the optimal ultrafiltration method for patients undergoing lung transplantation with CPB is warranted.",

            "text": "Lung tissue was collected in tubes containing TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen Japan K.K.) and stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C until analysis to isolate total RNA from the lungs. Samples were incubated for 15 minutes at 30\u00b0C to permit complete tissue dissociation. Samples were mixed with 0.2 mL of chloroform per 1 mL of TRIZOL and were centrifuged at 12,000g for 15 minutes at 8\u00b0C. The aqueous phase was collected and transferred to fresh tubes. The RNA was precipitated by mixing with isopropyl alcohol. After incubation for 15 minutes at 30\u00b0C, samples were centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was removed, and 75% ethanol was added to the RNA pellet, which was then mixed by vortexing and centrifuged at 7500g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Finally, the dried RNA was isolated. Reverse transcription was done with 5 L of hotdenatured DNA-free RNA, 100 pmol of random hexamer primers (pd5[N6], Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 100 U of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics). The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 minutes at 20\u00b0C, 30 minutes at 42\u00b0C, and 5 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Products were precipitated with NaOAc (0.3 M, pH 6) and 2.5 volumes of ethanol (95%). They were then resuspended in 30 l of diethylpyrocarbonate-water and stored at \u03ea20\u00b0C. cDNA was diluted 100-fold with DNAse-free water in a siliconized tube (which had 10 ng/L MS2 RNA to prevent adherence to the tube wall), and 5 L was then used for real-time PCR. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on the LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics) was done with a total volume of 20 L in the presence of 2 L of 10\u03eb reaction buffer (Taq polymerase, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, MgCl 2 , SYBR Green, Roche Diagnostics) and 2 L of cDNA (or water as a negative control, which was always included). MgCl 2 was added to a final concentration of 4 mM, and 11.25 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer (Actin-LF: CCCAAGGCCAACCGCGAGAA-GAT, product size, 219 bp; Actin-LR: GTCCCGGCCAGCCAG-GTCCAG; IL6-LF: AAGGGGCATCTCCAACATCATCAT, 332 bp; IL6-LR: CTCCTGCCAAGCTGAACCCAAGAC) was added. Real-time PCR was performed in glass capillaries with an initial denaturation step of 30 seconds at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 0 seconds at 95\u00b0C, 5 seconds at annealing temperature (\u2424-actin, 66\u00b0C; IL-6, 62\u00b0C), and (product length [bp]/25) seconds at 72\u00b0C. At the end of each cycle, the fluorescence emitted by the SYBR Green was measured. After completion of the cycling process, samples were subjected to a temperature ramp (from 5\u00b0C above annealing temperature to 95\u00b0C at 2\u00b0C/s) with continuous fluorescence monitoring for the melting curve analysis. The relative quantification analyses the actual amount of a particular target transcript relative to an internal standard (a housekeeping gene) in the same sample. Results were expressed as the target/internal standard concentration ratio of the sample divided by the target/ internal standard concentration ratio of the calibrator.The average and standard deviation of relative gene expression of IL-6 of normal lungs and the experimental groups' lungs are shown in Figure E1 .Expression of IL-6 was significantly increased in group 2 over that in group 1 (P \u03ed .024). Simultaneous use of ultrafiltration suppressed IL-6 (P \u03ed .047, group 2 vs group 3).",
