The BS-REL test then compares two competing models 5 of evolution, one with adaptive substitutions and one without adaptive substitutions, and 6 decides which of the two models is the best fit. For each branch of the tree, the BS-REL 7 test provides a P-value that corresponds to the probability that no adaptation occurred in 8 the branch.

Most importantly, we show that despite this 28 greater evolutionary constraint, VIPs have experienced much higher rates of adaptation 29 in humans and other mammals compared to other proteins.
