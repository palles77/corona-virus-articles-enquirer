            "text": "Purpose of Review Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition with increasing domestic and worldwide prevalence that burdens individuals and the healthcare system with high costs associated with long-term treatments and acute emergency room (ER) visits. It can be triggered by ambient microbes, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. In this review, we examine the outcomes of asthma patients in relation to environmental exposures to ambient microbe products, focusing on whether exposure leads to asthma development from birth to childhood and if particular microbes are associated with worsened asthma exacerbations. Recent Findings Bacterial endotoxin is more prominent in homes with pets and may cause cytokine cascades that lead to asthma exacerbation. However, some studies have demonstrated a protective effect with early exposure. Patients with positive Aspergillus skin testing are more prone to moderate-severe or severe-uncontrolled asthma. Fungal sensitization is also associated with earlier onset of asthma and demonstrates a dose-dependent relationship of symptom severity and duration. Among viruses, rhinovirus has the greatest association with decreased lung function, severe asthma, and asthma-related hospital admissions. Distribution of microbial products and associated asthma symptoms depends on the geographical climate. Genetic variations among individuals also mitigate the effects of microbial products on asthma development and symptom severity. Summary Microbial products of bacteria, fungi, and viruses are associated with the development of asthma, more severe asthma symptoms, and worse outcomes. However, some early exposure studies have also demonstrated a protective effect. Bacterial and fungal products are related to decreased lung function and earlier onset of asthma. Viral products are related to asthma-associated hospital admissions; and the climate and patient genetics can also temper or intensify the relationships between microbial products, asthma development, and asthma symptom severity. Further research should focus on the effects of early microbe exposure and its interaction with human immune systems and asthma-related outcomes.",

            "text": "Every day, 10 people in the USA die from asthma [1] . In 2017 alone, there were 3,564 asthma-related deaths [1, 2] . Within the USA, the prevalence of asthma is 1 in 13 people, producing annual economic costs of over $81.9 billion, related to missed school and work, medical costs, and asthma-related mortality [1] [2] [3] . Ambient microbes have been shown to trigger asthma attacks [4] [5] [6] . The most common microbes are bacteria, viruses, and fungi [7] . Though the literature has clearly demonstrated that microbes and allergens can trigger asthma exacerbations, controversy still remains whether or not microbes promote the development of asthma with early-life exposure or if they have a preventative effect against asthma symptoms in an individual with established disease [4] [5] [6] . Many longitudinal studies have demonstrated that early This article is part of the Topical Collection on Allergies and the Environment exposure to ambient microbial products increases the risk of the development of asthma [8\u2022, 9, 10, 11\u2022] . Whereas, other studies, particularly related to human contact with animal microbes, have shown protective effects against the development of asthma [8\u2022, 12, 13] . With over 1.8 million asthma-related ER visits each year, which may be potentiated by exposure to various ambient microbial products in the environment, earlylife exposure to microbial products and its effect on the respiratory system later in childhood warrants further investigation [2, 6, 14, 15] .",

The main route of contact to endotoxin is via inhalation, which has been demonstrated in multiple studies [5, 14, 21, 22] . Of the 11 studies selected for review, there were two that specifically discussed endotoxin exposure from infancy [8\u2022, 24 \u2022\u2022] (see Table 2 ). Tischer et al. conducted a prospective longitudinal study examining whether early exposure to microbial products in dust was associated with allergy and asthma later in childhood for children in suburban areas using the following three birth cohort studies for children born between 1996 and 1999: [24\u2022\u2022] , dust samples were collected from children's mattresses, bedroom floors, and living room floors; and showed no association between endotoxin nor the fungal membrane lipid ergosterol in the development of asthma with exposure from birth to 7 years of age. Previous research has shown that endotoxin levels tend to be higher in homes with a pet such as a cat or dog in addition to homes of families that are low-income and/or may be in community projects that contain cockroaches [5, 31] . Similar results were seen in children by a study conducted by Mendy et al. [32] who found that overall for people who had a cat or dog, endotoxin levels were higher in the household with a pet and was associated with wheeze (OR = 1.30; 95% CI (1.04-1.62)) but not with asthma [32] . Co-exposure with dog and cat allergens modified the association with asthma, increasing the risk when exposed to endotoxin (OR = 2.00; 95% CI (1.04-3.83)) [32] [5] demonstrated that endotoxin exposure is associated with wheeze with exercise, office or ER visits, and use of prescription medication for wheezing [5] . Studies have indicated that lung function and capacity can be decreased due to continuous exposure to endotoxin in patients with atopic asthma [22, 33] . Lipopolysaccharide has also been shown to promote eosinophil airway inflammation in patients with asthma despite maintenance treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) [34] .",

The climate also plays a role in the concentration of endotoxin in the surrounding environment [14, 31] . Researchers have found a positive correlation between log 10 -endotoxin and current asthma (OR = 1.56, 95% CI (1.11-2.18), p = 0.046) for hot-humid regions and a higher incidence of exercise-induced wheeze (OR = 1.48, 95% CI (1.22-1.80), p = 0.009) for subarctic/very cold/cold regions [31] . High levels of endotoxin, regardless of being inside or outside the home environment, are associated with severe asthma [14, 35] . A study conducted in Japan by Khan and colleagues showed that asthma-related visits to the ER for patients 15-years-old or older was highest during the seasons of autumn and spring, when the environmental endotoxin was highest in the air [14] . Oluwole et al. [35] showed that for 7 to 17-year-olds, high concentrations of endotoxin within households, including mattresses, are associated with an elevated risk of moderate or severe asthma (adjusted OR = 11.40, 95% CI (1.45-89.43)). Tischer et al. [8\u2022] also supported these \u2022 Sleeping with animal fur was inversely associated with early wheezes at age 4 and current asthma at age 6",

In addition, these findings are also in accordance with previous investigations in the early 2000s [36] [37] [38] [39] . Non-environmental patient characteristics can also impact the development or severity of asthma. Mendy et al.'s [40] study determined that the combination of high levels of endotoxin exposure and low vitamin D levels are associated with an asthma diagnosis or recurrent wheeze (OR = 1.88, 95% CI (1.33-2.66), p = 0.02), current asthma (OR = 1.97, 95% CI (1.09-2.23), p = 0.03), wheeze over the last 12 months (OR = 1.72, 95% CI (1.10-3.7), p = 0.002), and recurrent wheeze (OR = 1.97, 95% CI (1.0-4.0), p < 0.001) [40] . Nevertheless, this study was conducted in adults and the effect from infancy to childhood, regarding vitamin D levels in combination with endotoxin exposure, would need to be assessed. No studies on fungal spore exposure were found for the time period from birth to childhood to assess the development of asthma. [8\u2022] . Sensitization to fungal antigens is a key component to understanding asthma severity. Chopra and colleagues showed that asthma patients with skin reactivity to the Aspergillus skin test (AST) had more cases of moderate and severe asthma versus nonreactive AST patients (98.6% vs. 3.2%, p < 0.001) in a cohort of 282 adult asthma patients over a 1-year period. Sensitization to Aspergillus has been found to have a more significant impact on asthma outcomes compared to other species of fungus [41, 42] . For instance, Vincent et al. [41] demonstrated that adult asthma patients who were sensitized to Penicillium chrysogenum, [41] . Masaki and colleagues' study in Japan implicates a different species; their study investigated sensitization to Candida and found that out of 124 adults with asthma, more people had sensitization to Candida than Aspergillus (16 vs. 11%) [6] . The researchers also found that fungal sensitization leads to a higher rate of early-onset asthma (< 16 years of age) compared to those without sensitization (45% vs. 25%) and sensitization increases with age [6, 43] . However, further investigation is needed to examine early exposure of various fungal species during infancy and its effect on the development of asthma during childhood.",

            "text": "The fungal genus Alternaria has also provided more insight into fungal sensitization and asthma outcomes. Recently, Baxi and colleagues conducted a study in 37 inner-city schools in New England with school-aged children with asthma and observed that children sensitized to Alternaria had an association with asthma symptom days (OR = 3.61, 95% CI (1.34-9.76), p = 0.01); however, this did not apply to children not sensitized to Alternaria (OR = 1.04, 95% CI (0.72-1.49), p = 0.85) [44] . Researchers found that asthmatic children who were sensitized to Alternaria and exposed to high levels had 3.2 more symptom days per 2week period when compared to asthmatic and sensitized children exposed to lower levels of Alternaria. This suggests a dose-dependent relationship between mold exposure and asthma severity [44] . This finding is supported by Oluwole et al. [45] , who demonstrated that high mold levels in children's play areas are associated with current asthma (adjusted OR = 3.0, 95% CI (1.11-8.0)). Furthermore, additional studies have demonstrated that sensitization to Alternaria increases with higher mold concentration exposure and may lead to a risk of hospitalization, especially in the urban setting [46] [47] [48] [49] .",

Ergosterol has also demonstrated a low affinity for the development of asthma [52] . However, exposure to fungal spores has been shown by multiple studies in adults to be associated with asthma exacerbations; yet, there are very few studies involving children [53] [54] [55] . In a study analyzing the fungal microbiome in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with asthma in Italy, Carpagnano et al. [53] found that in 47 adults with asthma, 94% of the people were colonized in the EBC by Cladodosporium species, 21% by Alternaria, and 24% by Penicillium species [53] . Fungal colonization tended to be higher in asthmatics with severe and uncontrolled asthma with sensitization to fungal species such as Alternaria [53] [54] [55] . The differing levels of fungal species, with Cladosporium being the most abundant, and Alternaria and Penicillium in lower quantities, was also found in Manitoba, Canada, by Polyzoi and Polyzois, examining mold within the bedrooms and basements of 3424 school-aged children [56] . Cladosporium was the most common mold found in homes (98.2% of bedrooms and 97.8% of basements), followed by Alternaria (82.4% of bedrooms and 77% of basements), and Penicillium (35.4% of bedrooms and 48.8% of basements). In addition, visible mold in bedrooms and basements in participants' homes were associated with persistent asthma and colds (16.8%, p < 0.0001). Other fungal studies conducted in Europe, Canada, and Australia have also found similar results [45, 57, 58] . Viral exposure also plays a critical role in the development of asthma and asthma morbidity [9, 11\u2022] .",

Researchers tested for common viruses including HRV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3), influenza virus (IFV), human bocavirus (HB0V 1 ), atadenovirus (ADV), human coronavirus (HCOV), and hepatitis E virus. Of all the viruses, HRV was the most prominent among inpatients with severe asthma exacerbations at 50.3% and HCOV was the least at 0% [15] . The researchers found three variants of the HRV: HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C, with HRV-C being the most virulent for severe asthma exacerbations [15] . Other studies conducted in Japan, France, and Australia have also identified rhinovirus as the most common viral culprit for asthma exacerbations [28, [60] [61] [62] .

[60] performed a study in Australia with 44 virus-positive adolescent and adult patients (including rhinovirus, human coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and human metapneumovirus) and 44 controls. The researchers found that patients with TSLP expression had lower levels of sputum eosinophils, lower fractional exhaled nitric oxide, higher blood neutrophils, lower asthma control questionnaire scores, and higher FEV 1 in comparison to patients with low TSLP expression levels [60] .

Two of the RSV studies showed that males from infancy to childhood have a high tendency of developing asthma after an infection, compared to females [28, 29] (see Table 2 ). Two out of the four studies were retrospective cohort studies and the other two were prospective cohort studies [10, [28] [29] [30] . One of the retrospective studies showed that peak time for RSV-related hospitalizations was during autumn [29] . The RSV studies showed a high risk for asthma with RSV infection and that the cytokines IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 are elevated during infection, which leads to respiratory inflammation [10, 28] . Kitsantas et al. [30] conducted a 6-year long study from birth to 6 years of age, examining the risk of the development of asthma by 6 years with early exposure of RSV infection during infancy. Results showed that exposure to RSV did increase the risk of asthma by age 6 (OR = 1.99, 95% CI (1.06-3.74)). However, children who had a parent with a history of asthma posed a higher risk for childhood asthma by age 6 (OR = 3.86, 95% CI (2.61-5.71)) [30] . A maternal history of asthma has also been demonstrated by O'Connor et al. [24\u2022\u2022] to increase the likelihood of asthma in childhood by age 7 (OR = 1.79, 95% CI (1.18-2.74)).",

Patients underwent a clinical examination, blood analysis for a cytokine profile, pediatric asthma score (PAS) for severity of asthma exacerbation, and nasopharyngeal aspirates to determine viral infection using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of the 115 children diagnosed with an asthma exacerbation, there were 18.2% with a mild PAS, 37.4% with a moderate PAS, and 44% with a severe PAS [63] . Nguyen-Thi-Dieu and colleagues found that 54.8% of the asthmatic children were positive for HRV [63] . The high number of asthma patients with a severe PAS score (44%) was associated with a high number of children diagnosed with HRV [63] . The researchers also found that the percentage of leukocytes in asthmatic children with HRV was significantly higher, compared to children without HRV (76.2% vs. 59.6%, p < 0.05) [63] .

            "text": "This review has shed light on several different findings within the literature. Based on the information provided, sensitization within the non-farming community for bacterial, fungal, and viral products increases with IgE Ab expression and over time with age [43, 64, 77] . In terms of the fungal species, Aspergillus fumigatus has shown to induce one of the highest sensitizations for moderate/severe asthma [54, 78] . In addition, human colonization of the genera Cladosporium, Alternaria, and Penicillium have been associated with severe asthma and their ambient environmental concentration is similarly proportional in various parts of the world [41, 45, 53, [56] [57] [58] . For viruses, rhinovirus has been shown to be one of the most common triggers of a viral source for an asthma exacerbation [9, 11\u2022, 15, 63, 79, 80] . Early exposure to endotoxin at a young age within the farm setting with direct animal contact may reduce the chances of developing asthma later in life [12, 22, 75, 76] . For children not living on a farm, growing up with a cat or dog may have a protective effect against asthma symptoms [8\u2022, 24\u2022\u2022] . The mechanism of this effect is yet to be understood and it appears that genetics plays a role in asthma severity especially among ethnic minorities [72] .",

In addition, since studies have shown that people with severe asthma may be colonized with various genus of fungi, it would be worthwhile to further investigate the treatment of moderate/severe asthmatics colonized with fungi with other methods not associated with toxic side effects related to current medications for anti-fungals. In addition, more studies are needed examining the mechanism(s) for the transition of bacteria in the microbiome during childhood and how this may effect asthma outcomes. Biomarkers such as dimethylamine, a metabolite produced by bacteria within the gastrointestinal tract, may pose a clue as it has been demonstrated to decrease in concentration from higher to lower levels with the development of asthma in children [81] . Further advances are also being made with dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks a common receptor for interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), involved in type 2 inflammation [82] . In adult patients with atopic asthma, it has been shown to reduce severe asthma exacerbations [82] . This medication has recently been approved for children 12 years old and up for the treatment of severe asthma [83] . Continued exploration of the human microbiome and its interaction with the environment hopefully may lead to more discoveries. ",

It has been demonstrated that the climate and geographical region can affect asthma outcomes [14, 25]; and this was observed as high endotoxin levels were associated with asthma at age 6 for the PIAMA cohort (Dutch); an inverse relationship with the INMA cohort (Spanish), and no association with the LISAplus cohort (German). Also, other studies have shown that early constant animal exposure reduces the risk of asthma",
