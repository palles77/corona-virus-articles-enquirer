In order to understand the cleavage mechanism, molecular modeling tools were utilized to study the coupled model systems of the proteases, i.e., trypsin and furin and peptides of the cleavage sites specific to H5N1 and H1 HAs, which constitute models of HA precursor in complex with cleavage proteases. The peptide segments 'RERRRKKR # G' and 'SIQSR # G' from the high pathogenic H5N1 H5 and the low pathogenic H1N1 H1 cleavage sites were docking to the trypsin and furin active pockets, respectively. It was observed through the docking studies that trypsin was able to recognize and cleave both the high pathogenic and low pathogenic hemagglutinin, while furin could only cleave the high pathogenic hemagglutinin. An analysis of binding energies indicated that furin got most of its selectivity due to the interactions with P 1 , P 4 , and P 6 , while having less interaction with P 2 and little interactions with P 3 , P 5 , P 7 , and P 8 . Some mutations of H5N1 H5 cleavage sequence fitted less well into furin and would reduce high pathogenicity of the virus. These findings hint that we should focus at the subsites P 1 , P 4 , and P 6 for developing drugs against H5N1 viruses.",

The hemagglutinin (HA) is a glycoprotein which is responsible for binding of virus to cell and mediating fusion of the viral and cellular membranes after endocytosis (Wiley and Skehel, 1987; Martin et al., 1998) . The HA is synthesized as a precursor HA0 (Kido et al., 1993; Hatta et al., 2001) . To be infectious, HA0 must be cleaved into two subunits, HA1 and HA2. HA0s of all influenza A viruses are cleaved at an arginine residue adjacent to the conserved glycine, which becomes the N-terminus of HA2 (Steinhauer, 1999) . The cleavage activation of HA0 can be achieved by two classes of proteases. One is lysine or arginine favoring trypsin-like proteases, which exist in a limited number of cells or tissue types. The other is ubiquitous subtilisin-like proteases which only recognize the sequence of polybasic residues (Kawaoka and Webster, 1988) . The distribution of these proteases in the host and the sequence of the HA cleavage site appear to be the prime determinant for the virus pathogenicity.",

The structure of H5 is generally aligned very well with that of H1 except for a few specific sites (Stevens et al., 2006) , especially the cleavage site. The most common sequence of the high pathogenic H5N1 H5 cleavage site is 'RERRRKKR # G', consisting of polybasic amino acids with positive charges. It can be recognized and cleaved by both trypsin-like proteases and subtilisin-like proteases. While the low pathogenic H1N1 H1 (1RD8) cleavage sequence is 'SIQSR # G', with only one basic amino acid. It can be cleaved only by trypsin-like proteases. In this research, segments 'RERRRKKR # G' and 'SIQSR # G' from the high pathogenic H5N1 H5 and the low pathogenic H1N1 H1 cleavage sites, respectively, were docking to different types of proteases to study the catalytic interactions and the cleavage mechanism, and give insights into the high pathogenicity of the H5N1 virus.",

During each constant temperature cycle of Monte Carlo simulated annealing, random changes are made to the ligand's current position, orientation and conformation. The new state is then compared with its predecessor. If the energy is lower than the previous, this new state is immediately accepted. Otherwise, it is accepted probabilistically.

The transparent molecular surface represents the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface of S 1 pocket which is constructed by residues Asp189, Ser190, Cys191, Gln192, Gly193, Asp194, Ser195, Ser214, Tyr215, Gly216, Ser217, Gly219, Cys220, Ala221a, Pro225, Gly226, Val227, and Tyr228 (Ibrahim et al., 2004) . The S 1 pocket accommodates long side chains of the basic amino acid P 1 -Arg. At its bottom, a negatively charged aspartate residue (Asp189) forms a tight salt bridge with the substrate which is very important for its specificity (Schmidt et al., 2003) . A catalytic triad (His57, Asp102, and Ser 195) constitutes the core of the reactive centre, surrounds the susceptible bond between P 1 -Arg and P 1 0 -Gly, and passes protons to break the susceptible bond (Ma et al., 2005) . For the stabilization of the charges developing on the catalytic intermediates an oxyanion hole is formed by the main chain N-H of residues 192-195 known as a 'nest'.",

Six efficient hydrogen bonds are formed between the P 1 -Arg side chain and the oxygens of these groups. Any other side chain, including that of the other basic amino acid lysine, fits less well into the S 1 pocket of furin. By an initial inspection, it appears that the binding of the P 1 -Lys is identical to the binding of the P 1 -Arg with their long basic side chains inserting into the S 1 pocket. However, it was observed by a closer inspection that the P 1 -Lys binds to the S 1 pocket in a shallower way, only interacting with the carbonyl of Ala292 while losing the primarily interaction with Asp258, Asp306 and Pro256 due to the occupancy by lysine. The substrate substitution of lysine for arginine at P 1 position results in a docking energy weakening of 7.1 kcal=mol, consistent with the K cat =K m reduction of more than 160-fold according to the kinetic studies, suggesting the strict substrate requirement of furin for P 1 -Arg (Holyoak et al., 2004; Wheatley and Holyoak, 2007) .",

The S 1 residues S253-W254-G255-P256-E257-D258, W291-A292-S293-G294-N295, D306-G307-Y308-T309, and T367-S368 are in stick drawing. Residues P 1 -Arg and P 1 -Lys are in ball and stick drawing, where the arginine is displayed in elementary color and the lysine in yellow. (c) Interactions between P 2 residues and the S 2 binding pocket. The S 2 residues D153-D154, D191-N192-R193-H194-G195 and L227-D228 are in stick drawing. Residues P 2 -Lys and P 2 -Arg are in ball and stick drawing, where the lysine is displayed in elementary color and the arginine in yellow. (d) Interactions between P 4 residues and the S 4 binding pocket. The S 4 residues V231, E236, W254-G255-P256-E257, D264-G265-P266, and Y308 are in stick drawing. Residues P 4 -Arg and P 4 -Lys are in ball and stick drawing, where the arginine is displayed in elementary color and the lysine in yellow. (e) Interactions between P 6 residues and the S 6 binding pocket. The S 6 residues E230-V231-T232-D233, E236, D264-G265-P266-A267, A270, and Y308 are in stick drawing. Residues P 6 -Arg and P 6 -Lys are in ball and stick drawing, where the arginine is displayed in elementary color and the lysine in yellow (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this paper) Glu257 by a hydrogen bond. The geometry of the S 3 consists with the lack of preference at this site; however, long basic side chains are more favorable by the carboxylate of the surface-located Glu257. The S 4 binding pocket is a cleft constructed by residues V231, E236, W254-G255-P256-E257, D264-G265-P266, and Y308. The guanidinium group of P 4 -Arg is favorably framed by the carboxylates of Glu236 and Asp264 and the hydroxyl of Tyr308, for three efficient hydrogen bonding (Fig. 4d) . P 4 -Arg is ordered in a similar fashion of P 1 -Arg, indicating an important dependence on P 4 recognition for the specificity of furin. Substrate substitution of lysine for P 4 -Arg results in a docking binding energy weakening of 3.2 kcal=mol, with disappearance of three hydrogen bonds. Kinetic studies showed that the value of K cat =K m decreased 30-fold according to this conservative substitution, and substitution of an alanine resulted in a 2500-fold reduction in K cat =K m (Krysan et al., 1999) .",

According to energy contributions, furin generates most of its selectivity through interactions with P 1 , P 4 , and P 6 , with interactions at P 2 being less important and little preference at P 3 , P 5 , P 7 , and P 8 . The S 1 , S 4 , and S 6 pockets are specifically designed to accommodate arginine, with lysine substitution fitting less well in different degrees. The substrate specificity for S 1 , S 2 , and S 4 in this model is consistent with the former furin studies with tetrapeptide inhibitors (Henrich et al., 2003 (Henrich et al., , 2005 Holyoak et al., 2004; Rozan et al., 2004) .

Those mutations are classified into five types according to the number of basic amino acids: Seq.1 has the full number of basic amino acids; Seq.2 has the P 8 -Arg replaced by an aliphatic one; Seq.3 has P 6 -Arg replaced by an aliphatic one; Seq.4 has a basic amino acid deletion; Seq.5 has two basic amino acids mutations. Their definitions are given below: Table 2 ). For the type of Seq.1, RERRRKKKG, RERRKKKRG and REKRRKKRG fit less well into furin with the substitution of lysine for P 1 -Arg, P 4 -Arg or P 6 -Arg, while the other mutation RERRRKRRG induces little change because of the similar preference for lysine and arginine at P 2 position. Also, Seq.2 shows little effect according to the little energy contribution of P 8 position. For the type of Seq.3 with short P 6 residues, the energy is weakened slightly, while the substrate conformation changes, with the P 5 -Arg threading into the S 6 pocket opposite to P 6 side chains. The situation of Seq.4 is similar to that of Seq.3, the P 5 -Arg also threads into the S 6 pocket. While the last type with two basic amino acids mutations found in 2006 results in a large energy weakening of 18.7 kcal=mol. Most of today's H5N1 viruses possess the cleavage site of Seq.2 and Seq.4. If frequent mutation happens in proper positions, i.e., Seq.5, the substrate would fit less well and even reduce the high pathogenicity of the H5N1 virus.",
