In all but one of the lymphomas studied, the tumour cells were unreactive with the mAb HML-1. The HML-1+ lymphoma was the only tumour that was primarily localised in the epithelium and lamina propria of the small intestine, and was associated with ulcerative jejunitis and coeliac disease. This result suggests that the HML-1+ lymphoma was derived from intestinal mucosa T lymphocytes and differs from precursor T cell lymphoblastic lymphomas and nodal and cutaneous peripheral T cell lymphomas.",

This suggestion has been confirmed by generation of a monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated HML-1, that reacts with nearly all intraepithelial T cells and 40% of the lamina propria T cells of the intestine but with only occasional cells in lymph nodes, tonsils, blood, or skin.6 If the mucosa-associated T cells give rise to lymphomas, these should be identifiable with the mAb HML-1. To test this hypothesis, we investigated T cell (macrophage-specific) produced in our own laboratory. These antibodies were applied to acetone-fixed frozen sections. Their binding was displayed by the APAAP method,' slightly modified.s In addition, each case was histologically classified according to the updated Kiel classification.9",

His severe malabsorption syndrome did not improve on a strict gluten-free diet, and laparotomy revealed a 7 cm segment of thickened jejunum with enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. When opened, the 50 cm of resected jejunum showed some ulcers and multiple tumour nodules. Postoperative healing was uncomplicated Gray/week had to be abandoned after the fifth session because of a sharp deterioration of the patient's general condition.

Only one T cell lymphoma, that from the patient with jejunal tumour, reacted with HML-1 (table and figs 1 and 2). This lymphoma of pleomorphic T cell type was confined to the jejunum, growing mainly in the lamina propria and the epithelial layer. It was associated with ulcerative jejunitis and complete villous atrophy. DISCUSSION The findings in the case of jejunal lymphoma suggest that this tumour was derived from intestinal mucosa T lymphocytes. This conclusion is in keeping with the primary localisation of this lymphoma in the lamina propria of the jejunum and the spread of the HML-1 + tumour cells within the intestinal epithelium and the expression of CD8 and CD3 in the absence of CD4, since the majority of intraepithelial T cells also carry CD8 and CD3 on their surface. 6 The negative reaction of all other T cell lymphomas, including those with primary involvement of lymph nodes, skin, mediastinum, and stomach, indicates that the specificity of the mAb HML-1 for intestinal mucosa T cells holds true for cells that have undergone malignant transformation.",

Malignant lymphomas occurring in association with ulcerative jejunitis and coeliac disease were first recognised in 1937. In 1978, Isaacson and Wrightll,12 reported evidence that this lymphoma is of a single histogenetic type. These workers regarded the lymphoma as a special form of malignant histiocytosis, because it met the criteria for a diagnosis of malignant histiocytosis and immunological analysis seemed to confirm the histiocytic properties of the malignant cells. In a joint immunohistological and genotype study in 1985,13 when a wide range of mAbs and a T cell receptor-specific DNA probe were available, the T cell nature of this lymphoma was demonstrated.",

Two particularly important subjects are presented in considerable depth. The first is Bayes' theorem, by which the effects of a given test result on the probability of disease can be mathematically calculated. This leads not only to critical evaluation of the power of a test (based on its sensitivity and specificity) but also to the decision on whether to use it at all-there is no point if the diagnosis is already highly probable and the test is of low predictive value. The second important subject is decision making; here the authors use algorithms to show how a clinical decision can be reached with optimum results to the patient. Each algorithm includes chance nodes (points in the decision tree where chance decides the next path), and decision nodes (points where there are choices for the clinician). At each node probabilities of outcome are quoted",
