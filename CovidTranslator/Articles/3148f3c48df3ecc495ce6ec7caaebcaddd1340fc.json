One strategy recommended by WHO calls for countries with Ebola transmission to screen all persons exiting the country for \"unexplained febrile illness consistent with potential Ebola infection.\" Exit screening at points of departure is intended to reduce the likelihood of international spread of the virus. To initiate this strategy, CDC, WHO, and other global partners were invited by the ministries of health of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to assist them in developing and implementing exit screening procedures. Since the program began in August 2014, an estimated 80,000 travelers, of whom approximately 12,000 were en route to the United States, have departed by air from the three countries with Ebola transmission. Procedures were implemented to deny boarding to ill travelers and persons who reported a high risk for exposure to Ebola; no international air traveler from these countries has been reported as symptomatic with Ebola during travel since these procedures were implemented.",

Entry screening first began at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York City, then Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), Washington-Dulles International Airport (IAD), Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD), and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL). This program also allowed federal authorities to educate travelers, obtain their contact information, and link them with state and local partners to facilitate health monitoring, as appropriate, and prompt referral for care if they became ill. Of 1,993 travelers screened during October 11-November 10, 86 (4.3%) were referred to CDC public health officers for additional evaluation, and seven (8.1%) of the 86 were symptomatic and referred for medical evaluation ( Table 1) .

On October 11, 2014, CDC, in partnership with CBP, further enhanced efforts to identify ill travelers and travelers possibly exposed to Ebola by initiating an additional screening measure for travelers arriving from Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone. Although identification of ill travelers remains an important goal of U.S. entry screening, enhanced entry screening also has four broader objectives: 1) to identify, on their arrival in the United States, travelers who might be ill with Ebola or who might have had exposure to Ebola, 2) to ensure that these travelers are directed to medical care, if needed, 3) to provide travelers with information on reporting fever and other symptoms to public health authorities, and 4) to rapidly provide the travelers' contact information to public health authorities for active or direct active monitoring. \u2020 CDC and CBP began enhanced entry screening at JFK on October 11 and on October 16 at four other airports (EWR, IAD, ORD, and ATL). Together, the five airports are estimated to handle 94% of all travelers arriving in the United States who had been in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea within the previous 21 days. Six days later, the Department of Homeland Security exercised its authority to direct passengers flying from the three countries to arrive in the United States at one of the five airports with enhanced screening. . \u2020 With active monitoring a state or local public health authority assumes responsibility for establishing regular communication with persons whom were possibly exposed to Ebola, including checking daily for symptoms and fever. With direct active monitoring the public health authority conducts active monitoring through direct observation.",

Each traveler also receives a digital thermometer \u00a7 and instructions on how to use it. Travelers are screened with questions about symptoms and potential exposure risks, temperature checks (using noncontact thermometers), and visual observation for other symptoms of Ebola. If travelers have self-reported or measured fever or other symptoms or have been in a situation where exposure to Ebola could have occurred, CBP officers refer them to CDC public health officers stationed at the airport for further evaluation. Public health risk assessment of travelers is based on CDC-issued guidance (2), which classifies potentially exposed persons into three risk categories, whether symptomatic or not: high risk, some risk, and low (but not zero) risk. The guidance provides recommendations for the monitoring of these persons and their safe movement to avoid potential exposure of others during commercial travel (e.g., by airplane, ship, train, or long-distance bus). CDC officers determine whether travelers can continue to their destinations, and whether transport to a hospital for medical evaluation of symptomatic travelers is needed. CDC coordinates disposition of symptomatic travelers and those in the high and some risk categories with the appropriate state health department at the time of assessment. Persons identified as at high risk for exposure to Ebola would not be allowed to travel further on public conveyances.",
