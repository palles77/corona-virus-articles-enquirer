As early as in April 2003, close cooperation of researchers from many laboratories worldwide enabled the WHO to announce that the etiological agent of the disease was a new pathogen, SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Although SARS-CoV belongs to the family of coronaviruses, it is related to none of the strains of the family described so far [2] .",
