            "text": "Genomic relationships between turkey and bovine coronavirus (TCV and BCV), which are currently placed in distinct antigenic groups, were demonstrated by hybridization using specific cDNA probes. BCV-specific recombinant plasmid probes p 52, p 27, and p 247, holding inserts derived from (probably nonstructural) genes, and plasmids pN 17 and pN 9 holding the N and M gene, respectively, permitted the detection of isolates of both BCV and TCV with similar sensitivities. Similarly, probing supernatants of cell cultures infected with several isolates of TCV, using probes pN 17 and pM 78, respectively holding the N gene of BCV and TCV, resulted in equally intense detection signals. Only a slight detection of MHV-3, which is antigenically related to BCV, was observed, whereas the probes did not allow the detection of IBV, TGEV, and HCV-229E, which are placed in antigenic groups separate from those of BCV and TCV. Detection of TCV was improved by hybridization with BCV-specific single-stranded (ss) probes holding sequences of the N and M genes and synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction. Diagnosis of TCV in 134 clinical samples by hybridization was better with PCR-produced ss BCV-specific probes than with ds PCR-produced probes or a combination of six recombinant plasmid probes holding non-overlapping BCV-specific cDNA sequences. Detection signals were absent when probing clinical samples with 32p-labelled pUC-DNA.",

            "text": "Coronaviral enteritis (Bluecomb disease) causes significant economic losses to the turkey industry in the United States and Canada [6, 24, 28] . Turkey coronavirus (TCV) infects and destroys the major absorbtive cells of the small and large intestines, leading to severe diarrhea in young poults but mild symptoms in adults' [1, 22, 24] . Initially, the disease was diagnosed by oral infection of susceptible poults with filtered intestinal contents. Subsequently, detection of the virus was attempted by direct electron microscopy of clarified fecal samples [ 17] or detection of viral antigens by immunofluorescence in the cytoplasm of mucosal cells in frozen intestinal sections [19, 21, 23] . These techniques, however, are timeconsuming when large numbers of samples have to be screened and lack sufficient sensitivity. Recently, an indirect ELISA has been employed for detection of TCV in clinical samples [7] . Rabbit hyperimmune serum produced against purified egg-adapted and tissue culture-adapted Minnesota strain of TCV crossreacted strongly with bovine coronavirus (BCV) and murine hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV-3) although BCV and TCV are classified in different antigenic groups [20] . Subsequently, the existence of a strong antigenic relationship between BCV and TCV was confirmed by monoclonal antibodies produced against either virus [9I.",

Several recombinant plasmids, containing BCVspecific cDNA sequences [33, 34] , were radioactively labelled by nick translation and used None or in combination for the detection of TCV. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-produced probes which were highly efficient in detection of BCV [35] , were also used to detect purified TCV or virus in supernatants of infected cell cultures. The use of one recombinant plasmid, either BCV or TCV specific, was usually unsufficient for the detection of TCV in clinical samples from diarrheic pours. Therefore, a combination of BCV-specific probes or inherently more sensitive PCR-produced probes were used to detect virus in clinical samples to confirm the positive detection signals obtained with tissue culture-propagated virus. These results emphasized a genomic relatedness between the two viruses and ruled out the possibility of the activation in vitro of a latent BCV homologous coronavirus.",

One TCV-specific recombinant plasmid (pM 78) with an insert of 1.7 kbp containing the entire sequence of the TCVN gene ( Fig. 1 ) (manuscript submitted), was selected as a probe to detect TCV. BCV-specific recombinant plasmids p 52, p 27, and p 247, which served previously for the optimization of hybridization conditions for BCV-RNA detection [33] , and probes pN 17 and pN 9, holding respectively the BCV N and M gene ( Fig. 1) , were used in the detection of several coronaviruses in order to establish the presence of potential genomic homologies. The eDNA sequences of p 52 and p 27 of 664 bp and 1120 bp, respectively, were determined (unpubl. data) and compared with sequence data available for all structural genes of BCV [-4, 15, 18] , using the IBI Pustell sequence analysis programs. The translated sequence of the inserts revealed that they are parts of open reading frames. Although both probes were found to be specific for BCV [-33] , no sequence homologies were found between these inserts and the structural genes of BCV, suggesting that these inserts represent fragments of non-structural genes. Recombinant plasmid p 247, obtained by random priming of eDNA and holding an insert of 1.6 kbp was selected for its capacity to strongly detect BCV-RNA in colony filter hybridization assays. The insert of p 247 could be detected by probe p 27 in Southern blot analysis (not shown) and might represent at least a part of a non-structural gene.",

The amount of viral protein refers to the quantity of proteins measured according to Bradford [5] . An amount of 100 pg viral proteins is estimated to correspond to about 1.14 x 105 virus particles or about 1.1 pg genomic RNA. 100 ng pUC-19 DNA was spotted as a control on the hybridization itself.

TCV in the original clinical specimens could hardly be detected with probe p 52 alone (not shown). Clinical diagnosis was attempted with either the pBCV-pool of recombinant plasmids to amplify the detection signal or with probes, synthesized by PCR as a result of labelling to specific activities about 20 times higher than nick-translated probes. A total of 134 clinical samples from birds with diarrhea were extracted with Freon to eliminate binding competition between the virus and macromotecules present in the samples for sites on the nitrocellulose. Treated samples were then spotted on nitrocellulose membranes for hybridization with BCV-specific probes (Fig. 5 ). Among these, 36 samples were identified as positive with ss PCRproduced probes, whereas 28 of these 36 were positive by hybridization with ds PCR-synthesized probes. Only 20 positive hybridization signals were obtained when the samples were probed with the pBCV-pool of recombinant plasmids. Three of these samples were not identified as positive with either of the two PCR-produced probes and may have been false-positives. However, similar blots, incubated with radioactive-labelled pUC-19-DNA to examine possible background hybridization with vector D N A did not reveal any significant hybridization detection signals, supporting the specificity of the signals obtained. An optimized ELISA [7] on all clinical specimens performed rather poorly (only 9 samples were identified as positive; data not shown), may be as a result of repeated freezing and thawing of the samples.",

Our BCV-specific probes could not detect the BCV-antigenically unrelated coronaviruses IBV and TGEV, whereas only slight detection signals were seen with MHV-3 (Fig. 2) , which is placed in the same antigenic group as BCV [20] . Shockley et al. [31] also reported a weak detection with another strain of MHV (MHV-A59), using a 32P-labelled insert probe corresponding to the BCV N and M genes [15, 31] . Their BCV-specific probe could in addition detect the serologically-related porcine hemagglutinating encephalitis virus and human coronavirus strain OC43.",

            "text": "Clinical diagnosis of TCV with a BCV specific 32p-labelted probe (p 52) was initially hampered by both the low concentration of virus in samples and by macromolecules, which clog the wells of the slot-blot apparatus and compete with the virus for binding sites on the nitrocellulose. In a previous report on the clinical diagnosis of BCV [33] , we investigated several options for the elimination of these macromolecutes in bovine diarrheic samples and for the amplification of detection signals. Similarly, TCV in clinical specimens, that were treated with Freon before spotting, could be detected when using the pBCV-pool of recombinant plasmid probes (Fig. 5) . Although not observed in this study, plasmid probes may in some cases cause difficulties in clinical diagnosis due to vector homology to plasmids in the sample [2, 10] . Therefore, PCR [12, 29, 30] was applied to synthesize probe molecules from inserts in linearized recombinant plasmids to reduce labelling of vector sequences. PCRproduced ss probes were more efficient than nick-translated recombinant plasmid probes in detection of purified TCV and extracellular virions present in TCV-infected cell cfilture supernatant fluids (cf. Figs. 3 and 4) . In combination, the PCR probes allowed the detection of a minimum amount of about 104 viral genomes (Fig. 3) . Hybridization signals obtained with spotted pUC-DNA (Fig. 3) were likely caused by molecules synthesized by polymerase-readthrough into vector sequences of incompletely digested templates. Detection of spotted pUC-DNA was, however,, significantly reduced with PCR-probes when compared to recombinant plasmid probes (Figs. 2 and 3) , improving the specificity of the detection assay. PCR-produced ss probes were superior to other probes used in clinical diagnosis, probably as a result of incorporation of label to high specific activities (109cpm/gg; [35] ) and the absence of self-aamealing among the probes. Double-stranded probes, synthesized in PCR with 1/3 of the dCTP being radiolabelled were efficient in BCV detection but resulted in strong background after only 8 h of autoradiography [35] . In our studies on detection of TCV, the background was reduced by addition of more \"cold\" dCTP for ds probe synthesis; in turn, however, fewer numbers of specimens were identified as positive. PCR-produced probes to the BCVN and M genes were, as in the detection of purified BCV [35] and TCV (Fig. 4) , also superior in clinical diagnosis of TCV (Fig. 5 ). In conclusion, BCV or TCV probes may be valuable in molecular hybridization for routine clinical diagnosis of either virus but may be problematic when these two viruses have to be distinguished. Studies are currently in progress to establish the nucleotide sequence of the TCV structural genes in order to determine the exact degree of genomic relatedness between the two viruses.",
