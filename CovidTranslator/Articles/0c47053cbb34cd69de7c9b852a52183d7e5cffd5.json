To understand the pathogenesis of encephalitis and demyelination following JHMV infection of the CNS, we and others have examined the roles of the humoral and cellular immune response to JHMV and related mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV). Rodents can be protected from death by administration of monoclonal antibodies specific for the three virus structural proteins, El ,3 E24,5 and the nucleocapsid protein.6.7 Wege et a/.,5 demonstrated in rats that only anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies which neutralized virus and prevented cell fusion were protective.

Using the adoptive transfer of JHMV-immune spleen cells into JHMV-challenged recipients, two distinct protective T lymphocyte populations have been identified. First, nylon wool non-adherent (NWNA) cells (Thy I+, CD4', Lyt-2-) will induce a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in recipients. These cells are restricted by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II (I-A) identify between donor and recipient. Protected mice show vigorous perivascular mononuclear cell responses in the CNS but viral replication is not suppressed, and surviving mice show marked demyelination in central white matter. Second, nylon wool adherent (NWA) cells (Thy l+, CD4-, Lyt-2-) will protect mice, suppress viral replication, and prevent demyelination. The effect of these cells is dependent on MHC Class I (H-2 D) identify between donor and recipient and is blocked by administration of anti-CD8' antibody to the recipient. Protection mediated by the administration of either donor NWNA CD4' or NWA CD4' populations is prevented by immunosuppression of the recipients, implying that both donor T cell populations function primarily as helpers for host cells. Thus, NWNA CD4' cells induce a DTH response, prevent a lethal encephalitis, but are unable to block viral replication and subsequent demyelination; NWA CD4' cells induce CD8' effecters cells which protect mice, reduce viral replication, and prevent demyelination.",

Interestingly, when a reduced number of these cells are administered, sufficient to protect only partially from an ordinarily lethal JHMV challenge, many recipient surviving mice show a biphasic, relapsing disease. This finding is consistent with the observation that chronic CNS pathology often occurs when there is an equivalence or balance between the ability of a virus to replicate and the ability of immune system to clear the virus. We have also found that the onset and resolution of delayed disease is correlated with the level of anti-JHMV cellular immunity in these mice. This system provides a useful model for dissecting the regulation of immunological responses to a viral infection of the CNS with regard to clinically relevant phenomena, such as the onset and resolution of an episode of demyelination.",

            "text": "All mice were challenged immediately with JHMV antigen and the DTH response measured 24 h later. The average DTH response in naive mice was 27.2~1 Om2 mm. In contrast, an average DTH response of only 5.1 x 10 -' mm was found in NWA cell protected mice. This suggests that the lack of a DTH response to JHMV in NWA cell protected mice is the result of viral-specific suppression, since both groups responded equally to KLH. soluble products participate in the induction of this response.17 The suppression of the DTH response may reflect an attempt of the host to reduce the adverse effects of increased vascular permeability and the infiltration of activated monocytes. Consistent with our previous results, protection from death was not due to the suppression of viral replication in the CNS, .a,'0 however, in contrast to our previous data, protection was not correlated with a virus-specific DTH response.',\" The data presented in this report have demonstrated that the adoptive transfer of partial immunity to mice lethally infected with JHMV results in protection from death and the induction of a relapse of disease that is correlated with the virus-specific DTH response.
