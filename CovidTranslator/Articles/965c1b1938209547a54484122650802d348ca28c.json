All of these diseases were defeated by prevention. Achieving cancer prevention is a global priority, but history tells us that the pathway to achievement is difficult and full of detours and roadblocks. Epidemiology and clinical evidence clearly indicate that specific factors are associated with an increased risk for cancer development. What can we learn from the past that is applicable to the reality of successful cancer prevention?",

Positive associations between environmental factors or behaviors and increased risk of cancer development have been alleged as risk factors for at least 200 years. However, until the late 20 th century, very little progress was made in understanding the underlying mechanisms. The current hypothesis is that prevention is a highly feasible approach to cancer control. The question is, if prevention works, why does cancer still exist and still pose a huge human and economic burden all over the world? The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that cancer deaths will increase to 14% of all deaths in 2008 and by 2030, 18% of all deaths worldwide will be due to cancer (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/index.html). Importantly, WHO indicates that at least 30% of all cancer deaths are preventable 1 . This means, for example, that of the 7.4 million cancer deaths (or 13% of all deaths worldwide) in 2004, 2.2 million could have been prevented.",

            "text": "Historically, research efforts have focused heavily on 'early detection and treatment' with little emphasis on environmental and lifestyle causes. Cancer prevention research per se has seemingly never been a major health research emphasis until recently. But in spite of the renewed interest, only about 2% of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) total budget in the US appears to be directed toward cancer prevention and early detection (http://plan2009.cancer.gov/pdf/At_a_Glance_Budget_2009.pdf). This Timeline will examine past discoveries and evaluate the cancer prevention research climate over time. The various ideas, driving forces, and key players that shaped the field of cancer prevention research will be considered. The means by which scientific discoveries, concepts, or techniques have shaped the development of cancer prevention research will also be discussed. The big questions that need to be addressed over the next few years in cancer prevention and cancer prevention research will be introduced and the techniques that need to be improved or developed to answer these questions will be presented. unhealthy diet with cancer was recognized as early as 168 B.C. by the Roman physician Galen 2 (see Timeline). In the 18 th century, Bernardino Ramazzini, an Italian doctor, reported in1713 the almost complete absence of cervical cancer and relatively high incidence of breast cancer in nuns and hypothesized that this might be related to their lifestyle of abstinence from sex 3 . During this period, tobacco use was first recognized as a health risk 4 and exposure to soot by chimney sweeps was associated with a high risk for scrotal cancer 5 . In the 19 th century, arsenic 6 , aromatic amines 7 and various other chemicals were added to the list of environmental cancer risk factors 8 . In 1902, X-rays were found to induce tumors 9, 10 and in 1911 Peyton Rous showed that viruses can cause cancer in chickens 11 . The presence of carcinogens in coal tar was established in 1915 when laboratory animals exposed to this agent developed tumours 12 . These types of observations directed most cancer prevention activities to avoidance of industrial, occupational or environmental carcinogens 13 . Notably, these carcinogenic agents were identified by observational or epidemiologic studies, but cancer prevention research in the 18 th and 19 th centuries seemed to be almost nonexistent. Even though environmental and lifestyle factors were recognized as being associated with cancer, not everyone exposed developed the disease, which made recommendations of lifestyle changes difficult, if not impossible.",

Although cancer research was becoming more of a priority, cancer prevention research was still not recognized as very important. The idea that dietary changes, such as less meat and reduction of alcohol consumption, could prevent cancer was favored by some 17 . However, for much of the 20 th century, cancer prevention was not viewed separately from the practice of early detection and treatment.",

The ASCC was established by 10 prominent physicians and 5 business leaders in New York City, and later (1944) became the American Cancer Society (ACS). The ASCC became a highly influential organization whose goal was to encourage Americans to seek early detection and treatment with the idea that cancer was curable if this practice was followed 18 . This concept was the standard policy and practice for cancer control for the first half of the 20 th century 18 , which very likely contributed to the lack of organized research focusing on cancer prevention. In fact, the physician-dominated ASCC suggested that the idea of diet causing or curing cancer was quackery or food faddism and that changes in diet would do nothing to prevent or treat cancer 17 . At this time the focus was on cancer patient care for whom physicians seemed to be able to do little except diagnose and try to treat the symptoms. During the 1960s and 1970s, interest in environmental and lifestyle causes of cancer was eventually revived and these factors were emphasized as potential health issues. Even then, the idea of lifestyle changes posed a major threat to therapeutics as a driving force in cancer control or prevention even though therapeutics had not increased cancer survival 17 .",

In particular, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was established in 1930 followed in 1937 by the passage of the National Cancer Institute Act signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt that authorized annual funding to support research related to the causes, diagnosis and treatment of cancer (http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/). In 1939 the National Cancer Institute (NCI) was formed and the first research on the association of smoking with lung cancer was initiated. NCI later (1955) formed the Cancer Chemotherapy National Service Center to focus on screening of natural and synthetic compounds for their anticancer properties (http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/).

The establishment of an organization to focus on prevention of chronic disease should have moved the field forward rapidly.

Tamoxifen was shown to prevent mammary cancer in the dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)-induced rat mammary carcinoma model in 1974 41 and was approved by the US Food and Drug administration (FDA) to treat estrogen receptor positive breast cancer in 1978. In 1994, two genes, breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and BRAC2, were identified as risk factors for developing breast cancer 42 . This discovery further highlighted the need for genetic testing to determine risk for certain inherited cancers and might also have strengthened the idea of using surgery, such as mastectomy and oophorectomy, as a means of preventing cancer occurrence.",

Later, Wynder reported that barrier contraceptives were associated with a lower risk of cervical cancer, implicating a transmissive agent in the etiology of cervical cancer 45 . Despite the early work of Peyton Rous, the viral theory of carcinogenesis was not taken seriously until the 1940s and became a dominant theory through the 1970s 13 . In 1974, the idea that cervical cancer might be caused by a viral agent was suggested 46 . The concept that certain cancers might be induced by viral infection lead to a great deal of funding being spent on the development of vaccines 47 . The first human viral vaccine that can prevent cancer -the hepatitis B virus vaccine to prevent liver cancer -was introduced in 1981 48 . The human papillomavirus (HPV) was identified as a risk factor for cervical cancer in 1987 49, 50 . The Hybrid Capture II human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test was approved by the FDA in 1999 as a test that can be used in conjunction with the Pap smear in screening for cervical cancer 51, 52 . The first HPV vaccine clinical trial was completed in 2002 with positive results 40 and those results were further confirmed more recently 53 . In 2006, the FDA approved the vaccine Gardasil 54 , which protects against persistent infection by two types (16 and 18) of HPV that cause approximately 70 percent of cervical cancers worldwide 55 . Administering HPV vaccine to HPV-na\u00efve women and sexually active women has been suggested as a means to substantially reduce the incidence of HPV16/18-related cancers 56 .",

The existence of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight was well established by 1920 and interest in understanding the effect of UV radiation on humans was increasing 57 . Even though early scientific research studies in animals 58 suggested that UV might be dangerous or harmful, the primary opinion at that time was that sunlight had a positive influence on health. However, by the end of the 20 th century epidemiological evidence supported by strong experimental evidence suggested that solar UV irradiation is an important environmental carcinogen and a major etiologic factor in human skin cancer [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] . Sunscreens alone appear to be imperfect in preventing skin cancers 67-71 because an increased incidence of human skin cancer even with the application of sunscreen continues to be observed [69] [70] [71] . The most effective prevention appears to be moderation or avoidance of UV exposure.",

This was the beginning of a change in NCI's research funding emphasis from treatment to prevention. Epidemiological evidence continued to suggest that even though 30-40% of cancer deaths were related to smoking, perhaps just as many were connected to diet 74, 75 .

In 1982, the second ACS prevention study (CPS II) was initiated to study cancer risk and prevention factors in 1.2 million American men and women (http://www.cancer.org/docroot/RES/content/RES_6_2_Study_Overviews.asp). Also, in 1982, a large working party formed by the U.S. National Research Council Committee published a report on diet, nutrition and cancer and proposed what they called 'interim guidelines' on diet and cancer 76 . This terminology was used mainly because they felt that to make firm scientific pronouncements about the association between diet and cancer was not yet possible because knowledge of diet and cancer was in an interim stage similar to that for cigarettes 20 years previously 76 . Based on their review of the scientific literature, they concluded that various cancers occurring in different human populations appeared to correspond with differences in diet 76 . This idea was based on observations indicating that individuals who move from countries where a particular cancer incidence is low, to countries where the incidence of that cancer is high, acquire the cancer incidence of their new home 77 . In general, they concluded that some types of diets and some dietary components (such as high fat diets or the frequent consumption of salt-cured, salt-pickled, and smoked foods) tend to increase the risk of cancer (BOX1), whereas others (such as low fat diets or the frequent consumption of certain fruits and vegetables) tend to decrease it. Based on these results, they recommended a decreased fat intake, especially animal fat, to less than 30% of total energy intake 76 . Other recommendations included decreasing sugar, salt and alcohol consumption, avoid being overweight, and increase the consumption of fruit, vegetables and fiber 76 . Notably, the 1988 Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health in the US indicated that the three most important personal habits that influence health are smoking, alcohol consumption and diet 78 .",

The mission of the DCP \"is to plan, direct, implement, and monitor cancer research and training that is focused on early detection, cancer risk, chemoprevention, and supportive care.\" NIH currently defines cancer prevention as the reduction of cancer death through the reduction of cancer incidence and suggests that cancer can be prevented by avoiding known risk factors such as carcinogens or smoking or by chemoprevention to reverse preneoplastic changes (http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/prevention/overview/healthprofessional).

These three trials were considered very successful in identifying drugs that could prevent prostate or breast cancer in high risk individuals. Results from the PCPT showed that men who took finasteride (an anti-androgen agent) daily for seven years had about a 25% reduced risk of developing prostate cancer compared with men taking a placebo 83 . However, finasteride treatment was also associated with a slight increased risk for developing high-grade prostate tumors. The first results of the BCPT showed that women on tamoxifen exhibited about a 50% decrease in invasive and noninvasive breast cancers 84 . However, tamoxifen was associated with increased risk for blood clots and endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women. Updated results 85 confirmed tamoxifen's ability to reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk women. In October 1998, based on the initial results of the BCPT, the FDA approved the use of tamoxifen for the prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk of developing the disease. Initial results from the STAR trial 86 showed that raloxifene and tamoxifen were equally effective in reducing breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women who are at increased risk of the disease. The effectiveness of raloxifene was confirmed in two additional trials, the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) in 1999 87 and the Raloxifene Use for The Heart (RUTH) 88 trials. Based on the results of these three trials, the FDA (September 2007) approved raloxifene to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women.",

In the early 1980s, Doll 75 reported that diet might be responsible for 10-70% of upper aero digestive tract, esophagus, stomach, large intestine and breast cancers.

The \"5 A Day for Better Health Program\" in the US was initiated in 1991 in a collaborative effort between the NCI and Produce for Better Health Foundation (PBH). Its purpose was to use every communication means possible to encourage Americans to improve their eating habits to reduce the risk of diet-related cancers and other chronic diseases. The goal was to increase the average per capita consumption of fruits and vegetables in the U.S. to at least 5 servings a day. Unfortunately, based on the data presented online (http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/5ADaySurveillance/), more Americans eat none or less than 1 serving (2.9% in 1996 compared to 4.4% in 2007) and the number eating 5 servings a day has increased by only 0.3%. The \"5 A Day\" program is going to be replaced by the Fruits & Veggies-More Matters\u2122 strategy by January 1, 2009 (www.pbhfoundation.org). The replacement program's goal is essentially the same-to direct American attitudes toward \"wanting to eat more fruits and vegetables\" as opposed to \"should eat more fruits and vegetables.\" Numerous dietary epidemiologic observations and animal studies for a plethora of dietary factors from fruits and vegetables consistently suggest possible protection against various cancers ( Figure 1 ); but in general, these findings have not yet been validated in randomized trials. In fact, results of most dietary intervention clinical trials have been extremely disappointing. In the mid 1990s, dietary-based cancer prevention suffered a major setback based on the results of the \u03b2-carotene cancer prevention trial in which \u03b2-carotene actually was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in smokers 96, 97 . Results from the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC Study) in Finland indicated that alpha-tocopherol had no effect on lung cancer incidence, but was associated with decreased prostate cancer risk 96 . Unexpectedly, a higher incidence of lung cancer was also observed in men receiving \u03b2-carotene compared to those who did not. Another study examining the incidence of lung cancer across subgroups of participants in the ATBC supported these findings, but also indicated that the \u03b2-carotine effect might be associated with heavier smoking and higher alcohol intake 98 . The statistical significance of the beneficial and adverse effects of supplemental alpha-tocopherol and \u03b2-carotene disappeared during post-intervention followup studies 99 . Concurrently, in the U.S., the Beta Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) was initiated and involved smokers, former smokers, and workers exposed to asbestos and its purpose was to examine the effect of daily \u03b2-carotene and retinol (vitamin A) supplementation on the incidence of lung cancer 100 . Similar to the ATBC, the \u03b2-carotene group had a higher risk of lung cancer compared with the placebo group. The trial was stopped and follow-up continued for an additional 5 years 97 . A later report indicated that plant foods have an important preventive influence in a population at high risk for lung cancer, but the effect is diminished with \u03b2-carotene supplements 101 . In another follow-up CARET report, the adverse effects of \u03b2-carotene and vitamin A on lung cancer incidence in these high-risk individuals persisted after drug administration was stopped, but no longer reached statistical significance 102 .",

Historically, the urgency to treat patients with diagnosed cancer understandably has been the dominant focus of cancer research. However, a boarder view is necessary because as with other diseases, prevention is likely a relatively straightforward and effective approach to control cancer. NCI's current approach to cancer prevention is defined by the use of advanced tools and technologies, including those used in genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, to determine the molecular events associated with the molecular mechanisms and early signs of cancer development (http://plan2009.cancer.gov/The_Promise_of_Prevention_and_Early_Diagnosis.htm).",

However, relying on epidemiologic data to identify specific dietary agents obviously has not worked very well, especially in studies that focus on the generalized effects of diet. Determining individual relevant components in a diet high in fruits and vegetables does not seem feasible because of the complexity of food and the evident limitations of questionnaire-based surveys. The limited success of effective, nontoxic anticancer agent development indicates that strategies need to be developed that can effectively differentiate between promising candidate compounds and those that are much less likely to exhibit efficacy. We must be able to identify the correct molecular targets and then be able to successfully transition preclinical results into the clinical situation. Failure of candidate compounds is often associated with a lack of efficacy, suboptimal formulation, unknown toxicity, or poor bioavailability. Developing nontoxic highly effective agents against a known molecular target is critical (for example nontoxic COX2 inhibitors). One approach to developing these kinds of agents might involve the testing of the agent in animals under conditions that mimic definitive clinical trial endpoints, such as administering the compound(s) when preneoplastic lesions are present. This approach would appear to be a better indicator of the human situation, and if a compound was effective under these conditions, this might indicate that it has a greater likelihood for success in Phase II or Phase III trials.",

Goals for Phase 0 trials include replication of preclinical mechanism(s) of action in a human intervention trial; characterization of initial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles; and evaluation of biodistribution patterns, based on imaging technologies. A phase 0 trial should be conducted before the traditional phase I dose-limiting toxicity trial, comprise only a limited number of subjects, have no therapeutic or diagnostic intent, and be relatively short in duration. Success in a Phase 0 trial might permit an improved selection of effective compounds for further development. Methods to identify compounds, which have good bioavailability and are highly active, earlier in the drug development cycle would offer clear advantages.",

These strategies must be practical and must focus on high-risk populations, such as smokers, carriers of known genetic risk factors, specific ethnic groups, sunbathers, and those in high-risk occupational or environmental positions. The total strategy must consider that cancer types vary in different countries and regions throughout the world. For example, Bangladesh is known to have very high levels of arsenic-induced cancers and both China and Korea have a high rate of smoking-and diet-induced cancers. The complete strategy will very likely evolve into more personalized prevention based on our different genetic backgrounds and varied sensitivity to environmental carcinogens.
