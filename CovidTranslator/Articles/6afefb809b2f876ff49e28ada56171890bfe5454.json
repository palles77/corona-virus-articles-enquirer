            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants, immunocompromised patients, and the elderly. The RSV fusion (F) protein mediates fusion of the viral envelope with the target cell membrane during virus entry and is a primary target for antiviral drug and vaccine development. The F protein contains two heptad repeat regions, HR1 and HR2. Peptides corresponding to these regions form a six-helix bundle structure that is thought to play a critical role in membrane fusion. However, characterization of six-helix bundle formation in native RSV F protein has been hindered by the fact that a trigger for F protein conformational change has yet to be identified. Here we demonstrate that RSV F protein on the surface of infected cells undergoes a conformational change following exposure to elevated temperature, resulting in the formation of the six-helix bundle structure. We first generated and characterized six-helix-bundlespecific antibodies raised against recombinant peptides modeling the RSV F protein six-helix bundle structure. We then used these antibodies as probes to monitor RSV F protein six-helix bundle formation in response to a diverse array of potential triggers of conformational changes. We found that exposure of 'membrane-anchored' RSV F protein to elevated temperature (45-55\u00b0C) was sufficient to trigger six-helix bundle formation. Antibody binding to the six-helix bundle conformation was detected by both flow cytometry and cell-surface immunoprecipitation of the RSV F protein. None of the other treatments, including interaction with a number of potential receptors, resulted in significant binding by six-helix bundle-specific antibodies. We conclude that native, untriggered RSV F protein exists in a metastable state that can be converted in vitro to the more stable, fusogenic six-helix bundle conformation by an increase in thermal energy. These findings help to better define the mechanism of RSV F-mediated membrane fusion and have important implications for the identification of therapeutic strategies and vaccines targeting RSV F protein conformational changes.",

There are no effective vaccines available for RSV. Currently approved antiviral therapy for RSV infection is limited to ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug with limited efficacy. Prophylactic treatment with the anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, is effective in reducing the severity of disease but is only recommended for high-risk patients (Johnson et al., 1997; Groothuis et al., 1993; Pollack and Groothuis, 2002) .

There are three viral glycoproteins on the envelope surface: the attachment glycoprotein (G), the fusion (F) protein, and the small hydrophobic (SH) protein (Heminway et al., 1994) . However, several lines of evidence indicate that only F, the fusion protein, is both necessary and sufficient for virus entry and cell fusion (Karron et al., 1997; Bukreyev et al., 1997; Kahn et al., 1999; Teecharpornkul et al., 2001) . Thus, the critical role of the F protein in virus entry, along with the fact that F is highly conserved and is a major antigen for neutralizing antibodies, makes it an attractive therapeutic target (Johnson et al., 1987; Eckert et al., 1999; Collins et al., 2001 , Zhao et al., 2000 .",

            "text": "The RSV F protein is synthesized as a 70 kDa precursor (F0) that is processed by proteolytic cleavage in the trans-Golgi complex to yield two disulphide-linked subunits: F1 and F2 ( Fig.  1A ; Anderson et al., 1982; Collins and Mottet 1991; Collins et al., 1984) . The mature F protein is expressed as a homotrimer on the cell-surface (Calder et al., 2000) . The ectodomain of the F1 transmembrane subunit contains two heptad repeat regions, HR1 and HR2, and an Nterminal fusion peptide (Fig. 1A ) (Collins et al., 2001) . Processing of the F0 precursor has been proposed to generate a \"metastable\" F1/F2 complex (Zhao et al., 2000) . In one proposed model, receptor binding triggers conformational changes in the metastable F protein, resulting in insertion of the N-terminal fusion peptide into the target cell membrane. The HR1 and HR2 heptad repeat regions then interact to form a six-helix bundle structure (Carr et al., 1997; Eckert and Kim, 2001) . According to this model, formation of the six-helix bundle structure facilitates membrane fusion by bringing the viral and cellular membranes into close apposition (Chan and Kim, 1998; Eckert and Kim, 2001; Russell et al., 2001) . The presence of heptad repeat regions that are capable of associating to form a six-helix bundle structure is a feature of several enveloped virus fusion proteins, suggesting a common membrane fusion mechanism (Lamb, 1993; Hernandez et al., 1996; Melikyan et al., 2000; Skehel and Wiley, 2000; Lamb and Kolakofsky, 2001) . In support of this model, peptides corresponding to the RSV F protein HR1 and HR2 regions (N and C peptides, respectively) have been shown to form a six-helix coiledcoil bundle structure, wherein three C peptides pack in an antiparallel fashion into the outer grooves of a central N peptide trimeric coiled-coil ( Fig. 3B ) (Zhao et al., 2000; Matthews et al., 2000; Lawless-Delmedico et al., 2000) . This model is also supported in part by the fact that C peptides are often potent inhibitors of fusion mediated by viral fusion proteins, including the RSV F protein (Lambert et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2003) . In the case of HIV, C peptide inhibitors have been shown to interact with the HR1 region of the HIV gp41 fusion protein during an intermediate stage of conformational change to form a dead-end peptide-gp41 hybrid six-helix bundle structure (Kilgore et al., 2003) . One HIV C peptide inhibitor, enfuvirtide, has been approved for the treatment of HIV infection. Thus, inhibition of viral fusion protein six-helix bundle formation is a validated therapeutic approach for the treatment of viral disease (Wild et al., 1992 (Wild et al., ,1994 Chan and Kim, 1998; Eckert et al., 1999; Zhao et al., 2000) .",

Electron microscopy studies of RSV F protein have revealed that trypsin treatment causes a change in conformation from a lollipopshaped structure to a cone-shaped structure, which are thought to represent the native and fusion-active states, respectively (Calder et al., 2000) . However, it has yet to be demonstrated directly that native, membrane-anchored RSV F protein can be triggered to undergo conformational changes leading to the formation of a six-helix bundle structure. Indeed, it is not yet known what triggers these conformational changes. Since, like HIV, RSV fusion takes place at the cell surface and is pH independent (Srinivasakumar et al., 1991; Collins et al., 2001) , it is presumed that binding of F protein to a cellular receptor triggers conformational changes. Although several ligands have been identified that bind to RSV F protein, it remains unclear whether any one of these ligands is a bona fide receptor for RSV (Pastey et al., 2000; Behera et al., 2001; Sano et al., 2003; Hallak et al., 2000) . The lack of a system in which to study native RSV F protein six-helix bundle formation hinders the development of therapeutics targeting F protein conformational changes.",

The \u03b1RSV polyclonal serum recognized the N and NC peptides thus confirming that these peptides contained authentic F protein epitopes (Fig. 2B) . Surprisingly, the C peptide did not appear to react with \u03b1RSV serum; only faint background bands were seen, likely attributed to cross-reactivity with contaminating bacterial proteins. One possible explanation for this observation is the presence of a conserved N-linked glycosylation site (aa: 500 NQS 502 ) within the HR2 (C-peptide region) domain in the Fusion protein (Figs. 1A and 1C, Collins et al., 2001 ,Zimmer et al., 2001 . Perhaps the presence of the carbohydrate side chain makes this region poorly antigenic. Alternatively, the HR2-C region may be buried within the native, untriggered RSV F protein oligomer and inaccessible to circulating antibodies. Studies of soluble F proteins suggest that this latter explanation is unlikely, since the HR2 region is proposed to form a stalk structure in the pre-fusion state (Lamb and Jardetzky, 2007) .",

To determine whether the peptides that we generated had antiviral activity, we tested each peptide (N, C, NC, or an N+C mixture) for its ability to inhibit RSV infection and syncytia formation in vitro in a dose-response assay. Consistent with previous observations (Lambert et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2003) , both the N and C peptides were found to inhibit RSV infection (data not shown). Also consistent with previous reports, the C peptide was found to be more potent than the N peptide (IC 50 = 8.0 \u03bcg/ml [1.6 \u03bcM] and 62.5 \u03bcg/ml [10.2 \u03bcM], respectively). The existence of a prehairpin intermediate conformation for RSV F1 is strongly supported by our observation and by others that RSV infection can be potently inhibited by HR-C peptides (Lambert et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2003) .",

Similarly, mixing N-and C-peptides together in equimolar ratio (N+C) resulted in the loss of antiviral activity of either peptide, presumably due to 6HB-like structure formation (data not shown). Circular Dichroism reveals that the RSV peptide NC or an equimolar mixture of N and C peptides (N+C) assumes a helicity characteristic of a six-helix bundle structure Circular dichroism (CD) was performed to determine whether the peptides NC or N+C have the solution structures similar to those predicted for the RSV fusion core from previous studies Wild et al., 1992) . We therefore analyzed the helicity of the NC peptide (or a 1:1 mixture of N and C, [N+C] ). The CD spectra for a 10\u03bcM sample of peptide NC in PBS at 4 \u00b0C, displayed a double minima at 222 and 208nm that is characteristic of the high degree of \u03b1-helical secondary structure found in the 6HB complex ( Fig 2C) . The mean molar elipticity value of \u221227,000 at 222nm indicates that under the conditions of the experiment the protein is ~85% helical. Similar results were obtained with a 1:1 mixture of the individual N-and C-peptide constructs (data not shown). These data indicate that the complex formed by the recombinant RSV peptides, NC or N+C, models the 6HB structure in a manner similar to peptides utilized in previous studies (Lawless-Delmedico et al., 2000; , Zhao et al., 2000 .",

The peptides NC or N+C were highly immunogenic and yielded relatively high-titer antiserum ( Fig  3A) , which we designated as \u03b1-NC or \u03b1-N+C. The antibody responses were directed primarily against peptide complexes NC or N+C rather than individual peptides N or C (Fig. 3B ). Furthermore the reactivity of antiserum \u03b1-NC (or \u03b1-N+C) to peptides NC or N+C could be completely adsorbed out by either immunogens (NC or N+C) but not by free peptides N or C ( Fig 3C) . These observations demonstrate that \u03b1-NC antibodies predominantly recognize 6HBspecific epitopes. The \u03b1NC or \u03b1-N+C antiserum did not react with a peptide complex corresponding to HIV 6HB (P15+P16) indicating its specificity to RSV 6HB (data not shown). Our results are also supported by findings in the HIV system, wherein a polyclonal 6HBspecific antiserum displayed similar specificity to a gp41 6HB peptide complex (deRosny et al., 2001). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the antiserum generated against the NC or N+C peptides was predominantly complex-specific and therefore suitable to probe for RSV-F 6HB structure. Since the \u03b1NC antibodies displayed a higher titer ( Fig 3A) as well as lower cross reactivity to free peptides N or C (Fig 3B) , this antiserum (84F = \u03b1NC; Fig 3A) was used for further characterization.",

These results are consistent with the \u03b1NC antibody epitopes being located in the F1 subunit (Fig. 4) . The lack of binding to F0 was interesting, since studies of soluble hPIV3 F protein suggest that cleavage of the F precursor is not required for adoption of a post-fusion conformation (Lamb and Jardetzky, 2007) . It may be that the requirements for 6HB formation differ between soluble and native, membrane-bound F proteins (Ruiz-Arguello et al., Yin et al., 2005 Yin et al., ,2006 . Conversely, the reactivity of the \u03b1NC antibody to the F0 form of RSV F protein in the western blot ( Fig 4A) could either be non-specific or result from small amounts of antibodies against uncomplexed N and C components that bind to denatured F0 (and, potentially, F1). Collectively, the above findings, along with the results of the peptide ELISA, strongly suggest that the F1 epitope recognized by the \u03b1NC antiserum is the RSV 6HB structure ( Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 ).",

To determine if elevated temperature could trigger 6HB formation in native RSV F protein, we incubated RSV-infected cells for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C or a range of temperature from 37 \u00b0C to 65 \u00b0C prior to staining with 6HB antibody. Following incubation at temperatures between 45 \u00b0C -55 \u00b0C, a specific increase in staining of RSV-infected cells, but not uninfected control cells, was observed ( Fig. 7A and data not shown). Repeated testing of the effects of temperature on triggering during a 5 min incubation using a thermocycler revealed that triggering reaches a plateau between 50 \u00b0C and 55 \u00b0C (Fig. 7A ). At 55 \u00b0C the level of staining by 6HB-specific antibody was almost equivalent to that observed with an anti-F monoclonal antibody positive control (data not shown), suggesting that a large proportion of the total population of F protein expressed on the cell surface was triggered under these conditions. In order to identify the optimal time for triggering RSV infected Vero cells were incubated at 55 \u00b0C for various lengths of time up to an hour prior to staining. Exposure to 55 \u00b0C for a 15 min duration resulted in the most dramatic/rapid increase in triggering (Fig. 7B ). Only small and gradual increases in triggering were observed beyond 15 min exposure up to 45 minutes, and then this effect subsided. These data, along with the results of 5-min temperature-course experiments (Fig. 7A ), demonstrated that a short incubation of 5-15 minutes at 50 -55 \u00b0C was sufficient to trigger optimal 6HB formation on the surface of RSV-infected cells.",

            "text": "The physiologic trigger(s) that activate conformational changes in RSV F are not known. The activation of most paramyxovirus F proteins at neutral pH is triggered by a three-step process including 1) binding of a viral receptor-binding protein such as HN or H to its cellular receptor; 2) interaction of HN with F, and 3) conformational changes in F that mediate membrane fusion In the case of HIV, the fusion protein, gp41, is triggered by binding of its associated subunit (gp120) to CD4 receptor on the target cell surface (Hernandez et al., 1996) . Since, like HIV, RSV fusion takes place at the cell surface and is pH independent (Collins et al., 2001) , it is likely that F protein also interacts with a cell-surface receptor, although such a receptor has not yet been identified. We could not test hydrostatic pressure for its reported effect to induce fusion active state due to the need for specialized equipment (Gaspar et al., 2002) . Similarly we could not test urea or guanidine HCl in our system due to their deleterious effect on cells ( A few early studies discovered that the low pH triggering effect for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) could be substituted by elevated temperature in the range of 58-62 \u00b0C (Wharton, 1986; Haywood and Boyer, 1986; Ruigrok, 1987) . The heat-triggered conformational change in HA coincided with the formation of a fusogenic 6HB conformation that is biochemically indistinguishable from the low pH-triggered conformation (Carr et al., 1997) . These studies suggested to us that elevated temperature could potentially serve as a trigger for RSV F protein.",

Such an epitope could potentially be unmasked by partial denaturation during incubation at elevated temperature and may not faithfully represent a conformation of the F protein that is related to authentic conformational changes. Alternatively, it is possible that the antibodies may detect an intermediate conformation of the F protein rather than the post-fusion 6HB structure. However, we consider these scenarios to be unlikely given the results obtained. The authors demonstrated that this form of the protein could be triggered to undergo conformational change to its more stable post-fusion state by heating to 50 \u00b0C (range: 45 \u00b0C -60 \u00b0C). Upon triggering at 50 \u00b0C, PIV5-F GCNt associated with liposome membranes, formed rosettes, and lost or gained reactivity to conformation-specific antibodies that were predicted to recognize pre-or post-fusion conformational states, respectively. A change in the shape of the soluble protein from a prefusion \"ball-and-stem\" to a more elongated post-fusion \"golf-tee\" shape was also observed by electron microscopy (Connolly et al., 2006) . Thus, our findings that elevated temperature serves as a surrogate trigger of RSV F conformational changes is consistent with previous studies of F protein conformational change in other paramyxovirus systems (Lamb and Jardetzky, 2007) .",

In this model it is suggested that the non-fusogenic neutral pH conformation of viral fusion glycoproteins (vFGps), including the native F1-F2 complex in paramyxoviruses such as RSV, exist in a kinetically trapped highenergy state, and that energy is released as a result of conformation change in the protein. In agreement with the spring-trap model, at neutral pH, heat, urea, or pressure can 'loosen' the native non-fusogenic form, causing it to transition spontaneously into a fusogenic form, suggesting that the native state of vFGps is 'metastable' (Carr et al., 1993 (Carr et al., , 1997 Paterson et al., 2000; Wharton et al., 2000; Gaspar et al., 2000; Epand et al., 2002) . These studies also propose that physiological triggers such as pH change or receptor binding fulfill a common energy requirement for performing the work of membrane fusion that could be satisfied directly by an increase in temperature or other destabilizing force such as urea or pressure (Patterson et al., 2000; Wharton et al., 1986 Wharton et al., ,2000 Carr et al., 1997; Haywood et al., 1986; Ruigrok et al., 1987; Epand et al., 2002; Seth et al., 2003) . The energy released during the 6HB formation is used to perform the work of membrane fusion (Melikyan et al., 2000) . Our demonstration here that heat can trigger the formation of the 6HB structure in the RSV fusion protein is consistent with the native state of RSV F protein existing in a metastable state. Our findings, therefore, extend the metastability hypothesis to RSV, a member of the pneumovirus genus in the family Paramyxoviridae.",

Similarly, this approach could be used to further study the requirements for 6HB formation in native RSV F. For example: Do RSV G or SH proteins have any influence on this effect? Does F0 undergo the same conformational change as cleaved F1? The thermal triggering approach could also be adapted to study the conformational changes of fusion proteins from other viruses for which receptors have yet to be identified. The triggering event and the conformational changes in the RSV F protein leading to 6HB formation are attractive antiviral targets, since disruption of these key steps can prevent F protein mediated membrane fusion. For treating HIV infection, a C peptide inhibitor (enfuvirtide; T-20) has been approved that targets the HIV gp41 fusion protein during an intermediate stage of conformational change to form a dead-end peptide-gp41 hybrid six-helix bundle structure (Wild et al., 1994; Kilgore et al., 2003; Matthews et al., 2004) . Thus, inhibition of viral fusion protein six-helix bundle formation is a validated therapeutic approach for the treatment of viral disease. The RSV 6HB antibody probe and temperature triggering technique that we describe could be applied towards the development of high-throughput drug screening assays to identify small molecule drugs that specifically block the conformation changes in the fusion protein. Proof-of-concept for this idea has been provided by the identification of an influenza virus fusion inhibitor capable of blocking temperature-induced 6HB formation in influenza virus HA (Yoshimoto et al., 1999) .",

(Zhao et al., 2000) and codon optimized for optimal expression in Escherichia coli (Fig. 1) . A cDNA construct (HR1/HR2) encoding both heptad repeat regions, HR1 (amino acid residues 153-209 of RSV F) and HR2 (amino acid residues 476-520 of RSV F), linked via a glycine-rich linker was generated (Fig 1, B and C) . Briefly, a series of overlapping complementary oligonucleotides spanning the entire length of either the N or C coding sequence was designed. The codons within the oligo sequences were biased for optimal expression in E. coli (Fig. 1B) . The oligos were annealed and extended in the appropriate order in successive PCR reactions to form two complete double-stranded DNAs encoding either N peptide (HR1) or C peptide (HR2). The resulting HR1 or HR2 PCR products were then re-amplified in a final PCR reaction using an upstream primer encoding a Bam HI-factor-Xa cleavage sequence (residues IEGR) at the 5' end and a reverse primer encoding the restriction site Hind III at the 3' end. The final PCR product from each reaction was cloned into the Bam HI-Hind III sites of the pET32a bacterial expression vector (Novagen) to generate the cDNAs HR1 or HR2, respectively. The linked HR1/HR2 cDNA (Fig 1B) was constructed by first amplifying the individual cDNA fragments, HR1 and HR2, in separate PCR reactions using complementary, overlapping primers that encoded each half of the intervening linker sequence, as well as a unique Kpn I site at their 5' ends. The resulting PCR fragments encoding HR1 or HR2 were then ligated together at their Kpn I site to yield a fragment encoding both HR1 and HR2, joined via a glycinerich linker (NC; Fig. 1C ). The ligated HR1/HR2 was amplified once more in a PCR reaction using a primer encoding the 5' end of HR1 and a primer encoding the 3' end of HR2. The final product was cloned via Bam HI-Hind III into the pET32a vector to yield the HR1/HR2 cDNA that encoded the single-chain NC peptide (Fig. 1, B and C) . The constructs HR1, HR2, and HR1/HR2 were sequenced in their entirety. The hexahistidine tag encoded in the pET32a vector allowed for histidine affinity purification of the fusion peptide.",

The eluted histidine-tagged fusion proteins were dialyzed against factor-Xa cleavage buffer (50mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]-100mM NaCl-2mM CaCl 2 ) in order to set up factor-Xa digestion. The fusion proteins were digested with factor-Xa (1:500 wt/wt ratio of protease:tagged protein) for 24h at room temperature to remove the leader peptide and histidine tag residues. The leader peptidehistidine tag was removed from the cleavage mixture by passing the mixture over a Ni +2 affinity column; the flow-through contained the RSV peptides (N, C, or NC) (Fig. 2A) .

Coexpression of homotypic receptor binding protein is required for efficient fusion activity of F (review see Lamb & Kolakofsky, 2001). In the case of RSV, G protein mediates attachment; however G is not absolutely essential for fusion (Karron et al., 1997; Bukreyev et al., 1997; Kahn et al., 1999; Teecharpornkul et al., 2001). The RSV F protein alone can mediate infection and syncytia formation entirely in the absence of G, suggesting that the RSV-F1 + F2 complex, like HIV gp120-gp41 carries all the domains necessary to mediate membrane fusion (Collins et al., 2001; Karron et al., 1997; Bukreyev et al., 1997; Kahn et al., 1999; Teecharpornkul et al., 2001).",

In the absence of a known receptor that can trigger RSV F, we looked at other viral systems with similar mechanism of fusion and tested several possible 6HB triggers in a flow cytometry assay. After a thorough literature search we selected the following approaches with some rationale for testing in the flow cytometry assay: Rho A (Pastey et al., 2000); ICAM-1 (Behera et al., 2001); human/bovine lactoferrin (Sano et al., 2003); Iduronic acid containing glycosaminoglycans (GAG) including dextran sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, heparin sulfate and heparin (Hallak et al., 2000).; trypsin treatment to enhance F2 internal cleavage (Gonzalez-Reyes et al., 2001; Zimmer et al., 2001); pH range 3.2 -11.0 (Hernandez et al., 2001; Mothes et al., 2000; Sturman et al., 1990; Zelus et al., 2003; Hsu et al., 1982; Holmes and Choppin 1966; Plemper et al., 2003); Destabilizing F2-F1 arrangement with dithiothreitol(dTT) and \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME) (Schlender et al., 2003; Plemper et al., 2003; Barbouche et al., 2003; Gallina et al., 2002) and mild denaturant, 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).

Notably, observed that following exposure to 55 \u00b0C, Sendai virus Fusion protein assumes the 6HB conformation. Pre-incubation of Sendai virus at that temperature (55 \u00b0C) blocked fusion by inactivating the F protein, presumably by pre-triggering 6HB formation in the absence of the target membrane. Patterson and co-workers working with SV5 -F mutants that required coexpression of homotypic HN protein to promote membrane fusion, demonstrated that the requirement of HN for F triggering can be replaced by elevated temperature(Patterson et al., 2000). More recently, for a newly identified paramyxovirus -SER virus (a rubula virus) -elevated temperature in the range of 55-65 \u00b0C could enhance hemifusion, cytoplasmic content mixing and syncytium formation in dye-transfer experiments between SER F-expressing cells and dye-labeled guinea pig RBC (Seth et al., 2003). More recently, Connolly et al. (2006) engineered a soluble form of the parainfluenza virus 5 Fusion protein in its pre-fusion state, wherein the function of the transmembrane anchor domain (TM) was preserved by replacing it with a trimerization domain (PIV5 F-GCNt).",
