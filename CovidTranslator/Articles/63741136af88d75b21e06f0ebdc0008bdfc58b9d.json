Healthcare workers are at increased risk to become infected because of contact to infected patients, infected co-workers and their community outside the hospital. The ideal organisational strategy to protect the healthcare workforce in a situation in which social distancing cannot be maintained at the workplace remains to be determined. In this study, we have mathematically modelled strategies for the employment of hospital workforce with the goal to simulate health and productivity of the workers. Therefore, deterministic models were extended to account for stochastic influences potentially occurring in rather small populations. The models were also designed to determine if desynchronization of medical teams by dichotomizing the workers may protect the workforce. Our studies model workforce productivity depending on the infection rate, the presence of reinfection and the efficiency of home office. As an application example, we apply our theory to the case of coronavirus disease 2019 . The results of the models reveal that a desynchronization strategy in which two medical teams work alternating for 7 days reduces the infection rate of the healthcare workforce.",

Under such extraordinary situations, the efficiency of healthcare workforce is threatened by several factors including: 1) infected patients, 2) infected co-workers and 3) infected persons outside the hospital. This is of high importance in the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 given that the virus may be transmitted by asymptomatic persons based on the long incubation period averaging at 5 days (1, 2). Unlike for most other professions, social distancing is typically not possible in medical teams where healthcare workers are required to work in close contact with patients and coworkers.",

In our models, we consider that a group of healthcare workers are divided in two teams of equal size. At any time, one team is at the workplace whereas the other team stays at home. A dichotomous work switch is implemented as follows ( Figure 1A ): during the first week Team 1 stays at the workplace and Team 2 at home; during the second week Team 1 stays at home and Team 2 at the workplace; next the teams continue alternating their location at the end of each week. When at the workplace, each healthy susceptible worker can become latent at a timedependent infection rate that is larger than when staying at home. Latent workers develop the infection at the workplace, at the same rate than at home. Infection of a susceptible by a latent worker can only occur in the workplace. We also assume that infected workers recover at the same rate at the workplace than at home, becoming again susceptible (SLIW) or fully recovered and immune (SLIRW). where is the infection rate, resulting into an infected in a latent state. ( ) is a function accounting for the number of people infected in the city, which we assume is growing in time. is the infection rate when the person is infected by a co-worker, is the activation rate of the sickness, in which a patient in a latent state starts presenting symptoms. is the recovery rate, where an infected patient recovers and becomes healthy. is a function that accounts for the work output of the workers, for simplicity we assume its growth is proportional to the number of available workers. For simplicity, we consider the death rate negligible and we do not consider recoveries coming from latent patients. In our simulations reported below, we set the initial condition to S(0)=300, L(0)=0, I(0)=0, and W(0)=0, thereby representing a large unit with 300 workers.",

Figure 4 and figure 8 show that, for our case study model of COVID-19, a decrease of productivity to 50% during home office (only half of the time can be used for productive work) does not imply a substantial decrease of the overall productivity. However, if the productivity at home office is above 75%, overall productivity is increased with a desynchronization strategy for high infection rates. When the SLIRW model was used to incorporate full recovery without the potential of reinfection, the protective effect of desynchronization weans over time ( Figure 5 ). In this situation, however, the number of healthy workers with desynchronization increases, especially during the peak of infected workers ( Figure 6 ). This observation is potentially the consequence of workers being immune to the infection thereby not requiring a desynchronization anymore. The protection of healthcare workforce ( Figure 6) and productivity (Figure 7 ) also depends to the infection rate in SLIRW model. Next, we aimed to determine the ideal level of productivity for each model (Figure 8 ). The ideal home office productivity strongly depends on infection rates in the model with reinfection (SLIW). In this model productivity is required to be around 60% for infection rates 3 and 10. In the model without reinfection (SLIRW), which is rather the case with COVID-19, the home office productivity needs to be higher in order to keep overall productivity similar between the one and two group strategy.",
