In this manuscript, the role of official social network perturbations generated by public health officials to slow down or stop a disease outbreak are studied over distinct classes of static social networks. The dynamics are stochastic in nature with individuals (nodes) being assigned fixed levels of education or wealth. Nodes may change their epidemiological status from susceptible, to infected and to recovered. Most importantly, it is assumed that when the prevalence reaches a pre-determined threshold level, P \u00c3 , information, called awareness in our framework, starts to spread, a process triggered by public health authorities. Information is assumed to spread over the same static network and whether or not one becomes a temporary informer, is a function of his/her level of education or wealth and epidemiological status. Stochastic simulations show that threshold selection P \u00c3 and the value of the average basic reproduction number impact the final epidemic size differentially. For the Erd} os-R enyi and Small-world networks, an optimal choice for P \u00c3 that minimize the final epidemic size can be identified under some conditions while for Scalefree networks this is not case.",

Here, they are assumed to depend on available information, misinformation, and the income/education of those making them (Del Valle, Hethcote, Hyman, & Castillo-Chavez, 2005; Fenichel et al., 2011; Herrera-Valdez, Cruz-Aponte, & Castillo-Chavez, 2011; Perrings et al., 2014; Towers et al., 2015) . There are multiple possible scenarios that consider the decisions that individuals may make over the course of an outbreak. Individuals may modify their behaviors in order to reduce their environmental susceptibility to a disease by washing their hands frequently, avoiding handshakes and avoiding kissing salutes, not taking public transportation during rush hours, using masks and more. The frequency and effectiveness of these decisions may depend on the perceived risk of infection, a function of what each individual \"knows\". In short, individual responses to new circumstances are adaptive and may depend on real or perceive risks of infection. Current disease prevalence, may become a marker or a tipping point, that when crossed, triggers individual or policy decisions. Whether or not individuals follow public health officials' recommendations may be a function of individuals' economic/educational status. The determination to make a drastic decision may be weakened or reinforced by each individual's networks of friends. Responses are altered by the opinions of work-related connections. Personal needs play a role, and they include the need to use public transportation or the desire to attend a social event.",

On the contrary, it may be altered from within (individual decisions) or by the use of preventive or active public health policy decisions or recommendations, some \"obvious\" like vaccination or quarantine, others drastic like mandated social distancing, as in the 2009e10 flu pandemic in Mexico ). Now, whether the dynamical changes experienced by the socioepidemiological landscape are slow or fast, will depend on many factors. It is within this, often altered, complex adaptive dynamical system, that individual decisions such as individually-driven social distancing, the use of face masks, frequent hand washing, increased condom use, and or the routine use of non-pharmaceutical interventions, takes place (Wang, Andrews, Wu, Wang, & Bauch, 2015) . It has been theoretically and computationally documented (Barrett et al., 2009; Funk, Gilad, Watkins, & Jansen, 2009; Funk & Jansen, 2013; Hyman & Li, 2007; Misra, Sharma, & Shukla, 2011; Perra, Balcan, Gon\u00e7alves, & Vespignani, 2011; Tracht, Del Valle, & Hyman, 2010 ) that massive behavioral changes can impact the patterns of infection spread, possibly playing a critical role in efforts to prevent or ameliorate disease transmission. Today policies are implemented regardless of our knowledge of who are the \"drivers\" responsible for inducing behavioral changes. Modeling frameworks exist that allow for the systematic exploration of possible scenarios. Through a systematic exploratory analyses of appropriately selected classes of scenarios, it is possible to identify possibly effective (model-evaluated) public health policies. The use of highly detailed models including individual-based models has some advantages since they can incorporate individuals' awareness of risk based on available of local information. The evaluations carried out on the effectiveness of changes, at the individual level, can be used to assess, for example, the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in reducing disease prevalence.",

The EE models account for the responses that individuals take in response to infection risks on disease prevalence at the population level.

These models have been used to study the dynamics of highly diverse diseases including, for example, influenza and HIV (Fraser, Riley, Anderson, & Ferguson, 2004; Poletti et al., 2011) , or in the study of generic infections (Kiss et al., 2010; Misra et al., 2011; Poletti et al., 2009 Poletti et al., , 2012 . Compartmental models (often using a phenomenological approach) categories designed to capture levels of awareness of infection. Such approach that can be used to incorporate 'awareness' in network models, is the objective of this manuscript. Some models assume that \"awareness\" spreads along with the invading disease, that is, through identical contact networks. Here, it is assumed that the disease and information spread over the same social network (a drastic simplification). The possibility that awareness and responses to the presence of a new infection among a subset of the population at risk, may significantly alter regular temporal patterns of disease prevalence (lower highs) have been studied. Studies have also shown that epidemic thresholds can be altered Poletti et al., 2009; Sahneh et al., 2012) in response to the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical intervention. Here, the focus is on the role of policy decisions/ recommendations in altering disease dynamics, possibly the final epidemic size, within a model where awareness (generated by official actions) spreads among those susceptible to infection and their 'friends'.",

Risk information is transmitted at different rates depending on the economic/education levels of individuals. We focus on single outbreaks, within a SusceptibleeInfectedeRecovered (SIR) framework. The dissemination of awareness (risk information) among the susceptible population, a process triggered by the declaration of a health emergency by the public health authorities, generates temporary changes on the knowledge and understanding of risk of infection, thus altering their activity and effectiveness as communicators of risk. Becoming aware of the risk of infection and inciting our ability to communicate risk, takes place at a rate modeled as a function of the economic/educational level of individuals in the network. Economic/educational levels are preassigned qualities to individuals in the network from pre-selected distributions. A susceptible individual may be a member of three sub-classes of susceptible: Unaware, S u , Aware, S a and Indifferent, S i . Unaware individuals that become aware of the risk of infection may (depending on their economic/educational level), change their state to Aware, that is, be ready to convey information, with different levels of enthusiasm, on the risks of the infection to neighbors in the network. Aware, is assumed to be a temporary state and so a transition to the Indifferent state is included. The triggers that determine or drive awareness state are a function of the disease prevalence level and not the time since start of the outbreak. The case when delays in transmitting real-time prevalence information to public health officials takes place, the most likely scenario is not considered. However, we know that it brings additional consequences (see (Velasco-Hern andez, Brauer, & Castillo-Chavez, 1996) ).",

Fig. (4) shows the results for network structures G E , G W , and G S . We observe that all networks, with or without awareness, support an outbreak for the chosen parameters (that is, the probability of extinction is low or the results are conditioned on non-extinction). Due to a lack of epidemic threshold for Scale-free network (Chowell & Castillo-Chavez, 2003; May & Lloyd, 2001; Moreno, Pastor-Satorras, & Vespignani, 2002) , we always observe an outbreak with severity that depends on the initial infected index. For the other network structures, we observe an epidemic threshold depends on the network topology; specifically, on the average number of neighbors and the levels of heterogeneity in the number of neighbors (mean and variance of degree distribution) (Kiss et al., 2017) . For example, for the case of Small-world networks Moore et al. (Moore & Newman, 2000) derived an analytic expression for the percolation threshold p c , above which there will be an outbreak. For the case when the network is homogeneous (Erd} os-R enyi network), the epidemic threshold is proportional to the average number of neighbors (average degree) (Pastor-Satorras, Castellano, Van Mieghem, & Vespignani, 2015) . Hence, for our simulation for both networks G E and G W we approximated the basic reproduction number using epidemic take-offs, when we had an outbreak, that is, whenever R 0 > 1 (probability of extinction for the parameters used seemed to be negligible).",

Our model results, highlight the importance of campaigns that warns a population about the risk and severity of infection for diseases that do not spread too fast, possibly including some flu infections or the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). For disease with a basic reproduction number that it is not high (Keeling & Rohani, 2011) , and assuming that these infections spread over a random homogeneous networks such as Erd} os-R enyi, it may not be unreasonable the existence of an optimal prevalence threshold to start and starting an awareness dynamic campaign.
