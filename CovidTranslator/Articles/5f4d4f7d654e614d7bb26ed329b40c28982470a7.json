Recently, a new SARS-like coronavirus, human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (HCoV-EMC), has been identified and the appearance of this new CoV raises concerns that a new spread of CoV may occurs in the future. By solving the crystal structure of HCoV-EMC main protease with a wide-spectrum anti-CoV inhibitor N3, we confi rmed that that N3 blocks the function of HCoV-EMC main protease through a similar mechanism to other CoVs. Together with the good pharmaceutical features, N3 is conceivable to be effective to HCoV-EMC and other CoVs appearing in the future. These fi ndings make it convincing that CoVs will not be a threat to human health.",

The infection was reported to manifest clinically with fever, cough and breathing diffi culties. Some patients also developed acute renal failure. Sequence analysis suggested that the causative agent of this newly emerged SARS-like illness is a new coronavirus (CoV) which has been named as the human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (HCoV-EMC).

Moreover, subsites S2 and S4, which are crucial for substrate and inhibitor binding, also show high structural and sequence similarities, indicating HCoV-EMC 3CL pro functions through a conserved mechanism like other CoVs. In our previous studies, a peptide mimic inhibitor N3 (Fig. 2B ) was found to prohibit the replication of CoVs in different groups by attenuating the function of CoV 3CL pro (Yang et al., 2005) . To be consistent with that the high similarities between the key residues of CoV 3CL pro s for substrate recognition, we found that N3 can effectively inhibit the proteolytic activity of HCoV-EMC 3CL pro with an IC 50 of 0.28 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcmol/L (Fig. 2C) .
