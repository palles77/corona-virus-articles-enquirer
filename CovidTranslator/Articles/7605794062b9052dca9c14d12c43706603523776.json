Amongst patients with CAP who reside in TB-endemic countries who are suspected of having TB, imaging studies as well as aggressive microbiological investigations need to be performed early on. Previous exposure to a FQ for >10 days in patients with TB is associated with the emergence of FQ-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates. However, rates of M. tuberculosis isolates with FQ resistance are significantly higher amongst multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates than amongst susceptible isolates.

            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The mortality rate has increased agents if urine cultures are positive for pneumococcal antigen, and macrolide-or tetracycline-related agents if urine cultures are negative for pathogens. However, the rate of penicillin, macrolide and tetracycline resistance amongst S. pneumoniae isolates is high in Taiwan [4] . The antibiotic options for inpatients with CAP are \u2424-lactams or respiratory fluoroquinolones (RFQs) (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin). In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), a \u2424-lactam antibiotic combined with a macrolide or with a fluoroquinolone (FQ) is appropriate [1] [2] [3] . However, the increasing resistance of key pathogens to \u2424-lactam antibiotics poses great challenges to physicians in Taiwan. RFQs can be used in the treatment of CAP in outpatients [5] , inpatients and patients in the ICU. RFQs have been shown to have excellent activity against key causative pathogens of CAP as well as atypical pathogens; however, use of RFQs for empirical treatment of CAP might mask the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), leading to delayed treatment and FQ resistance amongst subsequently isolated Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains.",

However, the rates of non-susceptibility to penicillin and erythromycin amongst clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae have increased markedly in recent years [4] . Therefore, caution should be exercised before administering macrolides for CAP unless atypical pathogens are highly suspected. For patients with co-morbidities, a RFQ or a \u2424-lactam antibiotic plus macrolide is suggested [3] . For inpatients with co-morbidities, especially in the ICU, a \u2424-lactam antibiotic plus either azithromycin or a FQ is suggested [1] [2] [3] . For atypical pathogens, FQs are as effective as macrolides. The length of stay in hospital and the time to clinical stability favour the use of FQs [15] . Drago et al. showed that the combination of levofloxacin with ceftriaxone produced the highest rate of synergy (54%), mainly against macrolide-resistant isolates, whereas clarithromycin combined with AMC was shown to be antagonistic in 22% of isolates [16] . No antagonism was noted between FQ and \u2424-lactam antibiotics [16] . The prevalence of levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae increased markedly during the period 2001-2007 in Hong Kong, especially amongst the elderly [17] . The most common aetiology of levofloxacin resistance was suboptimal use of a FQ in which small doses (100-200 mg) of ofloxacin and levofloxacin were administered two or three times daily. Accordingly, appropriate doses of a RFQ (levofloxacin, 750 mg/day; moxifloxacin, 400 mg/day; and gemifloxacin, 320 mg/day) are recommended [1] [2] [3] .",

Wang et al. evaluated FQ susceptibility as well as genetic mutations amongst isolates from patients who had been exposed to FQs from January 2004 to December 2005 [24] . They found that multiple drug resistance had the strongest correlation with FQ resistance (19% of isolates) [24] . Neither previous use of FQs nor the duration of FQ exposure was correlated with FQ susceptibility. Amongst the FQ-resistant isolates, 35.7% had a gyrA mutation (D94G and A90V) and 7.1% had a gyrB mutation (N538) [24] .",

            "text": "Dooley et al. was the first to point out the possibility that empirical treatment with a FQ might delay the diagnosis of TB [27] . Amongst patients who received empirical FQ treatment, the median time between symptom onset and receipt of anti-TB medication was 21 days compared with a median time of 5 days amongst those who did not receive FQs [27, 28] . However, the sample size in their study was small. Of the 17 patients who did not receive FQs, 7 received anti-TB therapy and 3 patients did not receive antibiotic treatment. The initial acid-fast bacillus smear was positive in 8 of those patients. TB was suspected in at least one-half of the patients who did not receive FQs, so antibiotics were not prescribed and anti-TB treatment was given directly. Interestingly, of those patients who received FQ monotherapy, 83% experienced improvement in the symptoms of TB, and clinical improvement occurred an average of 3 days after the initiation of therapy. Other studies have also reported that the delay in initiation of anti-TB medication was longer amongst patients who received FQs than amongst patients who did not receive FQ-based antibiotics (43.1 \u00b1 40.0 days vs. 18.7 \u00b1 16.9 days; P = 0.04) [28] [29] [30] . Median healthcare delay for patients who received antibiotics for non-TB diagnoses/indications prior to TB diagnosis was 39 days versus 15 days (P < 0.01) for patients who had initially received TB therapy [26] . Not only did administration of a FQ result in a delayed diagnosis of TB (median 29 days), but administration of other antibiotics (such as \u2424-lactams, macrolides or carbapenems) had a similar effect (median 31 days). In the study by Golub et al., only 57% of patients initially diagnosed as having pneumonia had a chest radiograph [31] . Interestingly, 34% of the chest radiographs suggested a diagnosis of TB; however, the patients were still subsequently prescribed empirical antibiotics. More importantly, both antibiotic use and not having a chest radiograph taken during the first healthcare visit were independently related to longer healthcare delays in the overall cohort. Mathur et al. showed that ca. 44-55% of active TB patients were given an incorrect diagnosis at the initial presentation, mainly because of atypical radiographic manifestations [32] . A study from Malaysia clearly demonstrated that a duration of symptoms of >2 weeks before hospital admission [odds ratio (OR) = 25.1; P < 0.001), history of night sweats (P = 0.038), a chest radiograph showing upper lobe involvement (P = 0.012) or cavitary infiltrates (P = 0.002), a total white blood cell count of \u226412 \u00d7 10 9 /L on admission (P = 0.029) and lymphopenia (P = 0.040)] was significantly associated with culturepositive pulmonary TB (Fig. 5) [19] . In addition, lower lung field TB (LLFTB) is difficult to differentiate from pneumonia and is often Fig. 5 . Clinical and laboratory predictors of patients with tuberculosis who were initially diagnosed as having community-acquired pneumonia [19] . CXR, chest radiography; WBC, white blood cell count. misdiagnosed because of atypical findings on chest radiographs [33, 34] . In Taiwan, ca. 20% of pulmonary TB patients have LLFTB [33] . Multivariate analysis conducted by Lin et al. showed that prolonged duration of symptoms \u22657 days (OR = 4.57; P = 0.038), lack of fever >38 \u2022 C (OR = 9.04; P = 0.001) and the absence of air bronchograms (OR = 12.08; P = 0.007) were significant predictors of LLFTB in patients with LLF pneumonia [35] . A calculated probability of >0. 36 [36] . Park et al. evaluated the impact of short-term exposure to FQ on ofloxacin resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patients with TB and found that the rate of ofloxacin-resistant M. tuberculosis was low and that most cases of ofloxacin resistance were associated with MDR-TB [37] . They also found that the frequency of ofloxacin-resistant M. tuberculosis was low amongst patients who were exposed to FQs for a short period of time [37] . These findings favour the application of FQs in the regimen for CAP or TB in patients with shorter disease durations.",

FQ resistance in M. tuberculosis is related to FQ duration and the timing of exposure. Exposure to a FQ for >10 days and exposure for >60 days before TB diagnosis were both shown to be associated with a significant risk of developing FQ resistance. Consequently, in Taiwan as well as in other countries with endemicity of TB, a short-course (5-day) regimen of a FQ (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin) is still recommended for empirical therapy for CAP patients if the patient is at low risk for TB. Furthermore, FQ resistance is less likely to occur amongst M. tuberculosis strains isolated from patients with short-term exposure (<10 days) to FQ.",

Prior to that time period, FQ resistance increased markedly from 7.7% in 1995-1997 to 22.2% in 1998-2000 [26]. Lai et al. found that approximately two-thirds of ofloxacin-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates were MDR and, surprisingly, the rates of FQ resistance were highest amongst adults aged 34-44 years [25]. Only 22.2% of FQresistant TB isolates (8/36) were susceptible to all first-line anti-TB agents. Their results were similar to those reported by van den Boogaard et al., who showed that the rate of FQ-resistant TB was low in TB patients and was not related to previous brief FQ exposure",
