            "text": "Molecular diagnostic techniques have revealed that approximately 43% of the patients hospitalized with influenza-like illness are infected by more than one viral pathogen, sometimes leading to long-lasting infections. It is not clear how the heterologous viruses interact within the respiratory tract of the infected host to lengthen the duration of what are usually short, self-limiting infections. We develop a mathematical model which allows for single cells to be infected simultaneously with two different respiratory viruses (superinfection) to investigate the possibility of chronic coinfections. We find that a model with superinfection and cell regeneration has a stable chronic coinfection fixed point, while superinfection without cell regeneration produces only acute infections. This analysis suggests that both superinfection and cell regeneration are required to sustain chronic coinfection via this mechanism since coinfection is maintained by superinfected cells that allow slow-growing infections a chance to infect cells and continue replicating. This model provides a possible mechanism for chronic coinfection independent of any viral interactions via the immune response.",

Prevalence of viral coinfections has been identified in many studies, reporting a highly variable detection level of 14-70% in hospitalized patients with respiratory infectious viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV), influenza B virus (IBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (hRV), adenovirus (AdV), human enterovirus (hEV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronavirus (CoV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and human bocavirus (hBoV) ( Achten et al., 2017; Asner et al., 2015; Kenmoe et al., 2016; Pretorius et al., 2012; Scotta et al., 2016 ) .",

Pinky). that respiratory tract coinfection affects severity of the infectious disease ( Costa et al., 2014; Mazur et al., 2017; Scotta et al., 2016 ) . Many clinical surveys on respiratory coinfections find that the presence of more than one viral infection at the same time causes not only increased disease severity compared to single viral infections ( Aberle et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2015 ) but also contributes to acute exacerbation and longer hospital stay among patients with pulmonary diseases such as asthma ( GGM et al., 2017 ) , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ( Dai et al., 2015 ) and bronchiolitis ( Richard et al., 2008 ) . For example, several studies on pediatric coinfections with RSV, IAV, AdV and HRV find that children with lower respiratory tract coinfection stay longer in hospital ( Aberle et al., 2005; Costa et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2013; Mazur et al., 2017 ) , suffer higher incidence of fever ( Calvo et al., 2008 ) and require life threatening disease supports like mechanical ventilation and ICU admission ( Mazur et al., 2017 ) in comparison to children infected singly with RSV, IAV, AdV or HRV. Besides children, there is evidence that coinfections can be more severe in adults. One study finds that hospitalized adult patients experience chronic lung disease when infected with multiple respiratory viruses ( Choi et al., 2015 ) . There is some evidence that respiratory infections can be particularly long-lasting, over a year in some cases, in immunocompromised patients ( Dobrovolny et al., 2013; Egli et al., 2012; Loubet et al., 2017 ) , with more recent studies indicating that at least some of these long-lasting infec-",

            "text": "To our knowledge, few experimental studies on coinfection are conducted in vivo or in vitro with different respiratory infectious viruses. Existing studies of coinfection have been mostly done with parasites such as bacteria ( Smith et al., 2013 ) , human malaria ( Taylor et al., 1997 ) , mosquito-borne dengue strains ( Pepin and Hanley, 2008 ) , animal viruses ( Klemme et al., 2016 ) , plant viruses ( Susi et al., 2015 ) or non respiratory viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, Hepatitis C virus and Hepatitis B virus ( Bellecave et al., 2009 ) in laboratories. Shinjoh et al. (20 0 0) were the first to design an in vitro experimental study to determine the growth interference ability of IAV and RSV in a single cell. Their study showed that simultaneous infection with RSV and IAV in Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells led to growth suppression of RSV infection due to the faster growing IAV infection; however the suppression of RSV infection was overcome by initiating IAV infection a few days after the initiation of RSV infection. Using immunofluorescence and scanning electron microscopy, they also observed IAV-RSV interactions at the level of viral protein synthesis where both viruses were found to replicate independently and release their surface antigens selectively from the infected cell during the budding period. They argued that the growth inhibition of RSV was due to the reduced cellular capacity for viral production, since both viruses competed for intracellular resources such as proteins or amino acids for their maturation. Another recent study of quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles as viral detection probes within cells has shown that not only different strains of the same virus, but also different respiratory viruses can infect the same cell ( Fayyadh et al., 2017 ) . Using the proposed QD probe, researchers detected AdV and IAV at different subcellular levels of the same infected human bronchial epithelial (A549) cell and found similar growth inhibition of one virus due to the presence of the other virus as the Shinjoh et al. (20 0 0) experiment. An in vivo study observed a similar kind of blocking interaction with avian influenza virus and new castle disease virus in poultry ( Shengqiang et al., 2012 ) . Additionally, other in vivo studies also noticed a sequential combination of viruses can control viral activities during coinfection ( Laurie et al., 2015; Shengqiang et al., 2012 ) . Thus coinfection can lead to complex infection dynamics for two or more viruses.",

We show the viral load, eclipse cells and infectious cells dynamics over the course of infection considering no change in cell capacity due to superinfection, i.e. setting superinfection parameters equal to the single IAV infection according to know the mechanisms of interaction between the viruses and cells. Since viruses are known to infect the same cell during coinfection ( Fayyadh et al., 2017; Shinjoh et al., 20 0 0 ), we integrate superinfection, i.e. simultaneous infection of two different viruses in the same cell, and cellular regeneration as potential mechanisms of interaction in the model. Our model shows that these interactions alter the effect of coinfection on disease outcomes in the human respiratory tract. We find that having superinfection along with cellular regeneration can lead to chronic coinfection, which cannot occur with either mechanism alone.",

Second, since we do not have any experimental data that explains immune response with respect to coinfection of two different viruses, our model does not explicitly account for any immune responses, however, this can be incorporated implicitly in the superinfection parameters, i.e. death rates of dually infected cells, 1 \u03b4 3 , superinfectivity rates, \u03b2 ij , and viral production rates from superinfected cells, p ij , in the model. Moreover, studies show superinfection may cause both enhanced ( Mosquera and Adler, 1998; Nowak and May, 1994 ) and reduced ( Brown et al., 2002 ) production of viruses; we assume that superinfected infectious cells produce each type of virus at different rates, p 12 and p 21 , than that of the singly infected cells so that we can explore the pathological consequences due to the different replication rates.",

For example, infection by one virus may increase the probability of being subsequently infected by other types since the first infection may weaken a host's immunity or resistance ( Soares et al., 2016 ) . Another study showed that primary infection evokes an immune response which reduces the chance for secondary infection ( Devevey et al., 2015; Klemme et al., 2016; Susi et al., 2015 ) . So we consider different infection rates for superinfection to explore the possible outcomes. Lastly, we also allow the transition rate of superinfected eclipse phases and death rate of superinfected infectious cells to vary across a range of acceptable parameter values for both viruses based. While there is no direct experimental examination of eclipse phases or infectious cell lifespans during coinfection, since viruses are sharing the cell's resources ( Shinjoh et al., 20 0 0 ), it seems possible that the speed at which virions are produced is altered. On a larger scale, the observation by Laurie et al. (2015) that in a ferret model of human influenza, subsequent influenza infections with different strains (H1N1, H3N2, IBV) limits the time duration of virus replication also suggests that these transition rates are altered.",

Although there is negligible natural target cell death before the cells are infected, we include this rate to make the model more biologically appropriate. We look for a steady state with non-zero values for both V 1 and V 2 , since this is the chronic coinfection equilibrium. Then we evaluate the stability of the equilibrium to determine whether there are parameter values for which it is a stable steady state. Finally, we confirm the theoretical results of the stability study by applying numerical simulations with one of the common coinfection pairs reported in clinical studies.

The viral titer increases with increasing regeneration rates; the more rapidly cells are being regenerated, the larger the sustained viral load. This dependence is stronger for IAV than for RSV, suggesting that as cells become available more rapidly, IAV infects the cells more effectively. We also investigate the variation in peak load of infected cells by varying regeneration rate, r ( Fig. 4 , bottom) . While singly infected infectious cells slightly increase with increasing regeneration for both viruses, the superinfected infectious population increases much more rapidly. This is further evidence that the chronic coinfection is maintained by the superinfected cell population rather than singly infected cells. ",

The equilibrium point, Q * 1 , represents two possible scenarios: (a) the system does not have an infection at all, but rather all the target cells remain uninfected (equal to the initial value, T 0 ) with any initial virus clearing before an infection starts; (b) an acute infection when target cells, T * , are equal to zero, meaning all the susceptible cells of the system have been infected and killed by the two viruses. We will call this second scenario Q * 11 . As there are no more resources left for the viruses to infect, both of the viruses die eventually and the system becomes free of infection. To determine the stability of the infection free equilibrium, we linearize the model about the equilibrium points, Q * 1 and Q * 11 , then calculate the eigenvalues of the characteristic equation of the linearized system.

Fig. 7 shows the coinfection duration as a function of pairs of the superinfection parameters. Considering the single infection rates as baseline values (given in Table 1 and indicated by star on the images) for superinfection, we vary the superinfection parameters on either side of the baseline to account for possible enhanced or diminished biological properties due to superinfection. The top graph shows the dependence on superinfection rates; the middle graph shows the dependence on k 3 and \u03b4 3 ; and the bottom graph shows the dependence on superinfection production rates. In the figure, the blue region indicates parameter values for which one viral infection is suppressed by the other viral infection; thus showing reduced duration, while the red region represents prolonged duration of coinfection. According to the top graph, both lower and higher values of superinfection rates give shorter coinfection duration than the single RSV or IAV infection duration. If IAV can reinfect the RSV infected cells as easily as it can infect the uninfected cells, duration of coinfection can be as long as about 1 week irrespective of RSV's ability to superinfect, although coinfection duration seems to be less sensitive to changes in superinfection rates than the other parameters. In the middle graph, we see that different combinations of k 3 and \u03b4 3 give different coinfection durations with coinfection duration increasing as both k 3 and \u03b4 3 decrease. Biologically this means that if superinfection causes viruses to utilize more time for intracellular activities (attachment, entry, uncoating, biosynthesis) and causes superinfected infectious cells to have a longer life span compared to single viral infections, duration of coinfection can prolong beyond 9 days. In the last graph, superinfection production rates have the most complex effect on coinfection duration with IAV superinfection production rate increases leading to longer coinfection durations, but RSV superinfection production rate increases having the opposite effect.",

In Fig. 8 , we examine how changes in superinfection parameters af-fect the peak viral loads of IAV and RSV in coinfection. We see that the production rates of superinfected cells influence peak viral load more than other superinfection parameters. Peak viral load for IAV and RSV are not, respectively, more than 10 7.2 and 10 3.6 PFU/mL even if the average transition time of superinfected eclipse cells to infectious cells and the death rate are short ( \u223c 2.4 hours) along with the slowest death rate of infectious cells. Similarly, a large variation in superinfection rates of IAV and RSV does not produce peak viral load higher than production rates from superinfected cells. Conversely, the peak viral loads can be as high as 10 9 PFU/mL due to superinfection if virus production rates are as high as 10 10 PFU/mL d \u22121 . Although IAV produces almost similar peak viral load to RSV for a wider range of production rates ( 1 \u2212 10 10 PFU/mL d \u22121 ), RSV only reaches higher peak viral load when both of them produce more than 10 8 PFU/mL d \u22121 . Thus, if superinfection production rates are higher than production rates in singly infected cells, the peak loads of each virus can be increased. This is not a likely scenario, however, since viruses are competing for intracellular resources ( Fayyadh et al., 2017; Shinjoh et al., 20 0 0 ), so it is more likely that superinfected cells will produce less of a particular virus than singly infected cells.

Numerical simulation of this delayed infection model ( Fig. 9 ) shows that for a time interval of the length 1 to 4 days between two infections, IAV as a primary infection suppresses the growth of RSV as a secondary infection while RSV being the primary does not affect the growth of IAV. Note that when the infections are not started simultaneously, the chronic virus titers are lowered from simultaneous infection for both viruses.",

            "text": "In this paper, we have shown that superinfection can result in chronic coinfection if cell regeneration is also considered in the model. Our previous work showed that while cell regeneration is necessary for producing chronic infection, it is not sufficient for chronic coinfections ( Pinky and Dobrovolny, 2017 ) . This work shows that superinfection alone is also not sufficient for chronic coinfections. When new cells are available for both viruses during the course of coinfection, the virus with the higher growth rate will infect more of the available cells than the slower-growing virus. On the other hand, the slower-growing virus which infected fewer cells in the previous cycle will infect even fewer cells in every subsequent cycle of infection, eventually disappearing. However, if there is superinfection, the slower-growing virus does not have to be the first to infect a particular cell -it can infect a particular cell after the faster-growing virus has already infected the cell. In this way, replication of both viruses can be maintained indefinitely. This is supported by our observation that chronic coinfection is maintained by the superinfected cells. While our model suggests one possible mechanism for chronic coinfections, particularly suitable for immunocompromised patients, the model is simple and neglects many of the complex biological process underlying virus-cell and virus-virus interactions. These processes can give rise to other mechanisms that could possibly lead to chronic coinfections. Perhaps the most glaring omission in the model is the lack of an immune response, which can be an important mechanism for interaction between the two viruses ( Hodgson et al., 2004 ) . A suggested mechanism for chronic coinfection via immune interaction is through the innate immune response. When a pathogen invades a host for the first time, a nonspecific innate immune response is immediately elicited. During subsequent infection it can be weakened enough due to the primary infection to let the nearby cells be more susceptible to a secondary viral infection ( Simeonov et al., 2010 ) . This antagonistic effect on the primary virus can facilitate access for another viral infection which can persist at the same time ( Mideo, 2009 ) . Introducing the immune responses to the model will allow for exploration of these mechanisms of virus-cell interactions. Unfortunately, the inclusion of additional parameters to address immune responses in the model has to be calibrated with a sufficient amount of experimental data that is not readily available. Another possible mechanism for chronic coinfections is cell tropism. Respiratory viruses are reported to show cell tropism, which is a viral preference for certain types of cells ( Matrosovich et al., 2015 ) . So two different viruses may infect different respiratory cell types, limiting competition for host cells because of resource partitioning ( Hodgson et al., 2004 ) . Thus both viruses may coexist in the respiratory tract for longer times and might also contribute to more virus production since now they have exclusive access to certain cells. Again, a mathematical model extended Fig. 7 . Coinfection duration as a function of superinfection parameters when both target cell regeneration and death are absent. Coinfection duration dependence on superinfection infection rates varied from single virus infection rates (baseline rates) of IAV and RSV, i.e. 8 . 27 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and 3 . 08 \u00d7 10 \u22122 (PFU/mL) \u22121 d \u22121 respectively (top), superinfected transition rate of eclipse cells and death rate of infectious cells varied from the baseline rates, i.e. 4.2 d \u22121 for both (IAV parameter) (middle), and superinfection production rates varied from the baseline rates of IAV and RSV, i.e. 1.2 \u00d7 10 8 and 7.64 \u00d7 10 3 PFU/mL d \u22121 respectively (bottom). Other parameters are fixed to respective single virus parameters according to Table 1 . Star on the images indicates the baseline values 5 .",

            "text": "The model also makes a number of assumptions about the superinfection process. Since experimental observations of this process are still in the early stages, there is not much known about the details. For example, we limit a cell's susceptibility to a second infection to the eclipse phase of the first virus. There is, as yet, no experimental evidence to inform us of how long an infected cell remains susceptible to a secondary infection. We also allow for the infectious lifespan and eclipse phase duration of superinfected cells to differ from singly infected cells. This is motivated by Table 1 . the idea that viruses share internal resources ( Shinjoh et al., 20 0 0 ), which might slow production of proteins and RNA, thereby lengthening the eclipse phase duration. But other mechanisms might alter the rates of internal protein and RNA production. Infection of a cell induces cellular responses that inhibit the replication of the virus ( Tang et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2012; Xue et al., 2018 ) while viruses have developed mechanisms to prevent these responses ( Wang et al., 2014 ) . Thus, if one of the viruses involved in the superinfection can inhibit a cellular response that suppresses viral replication, the other virus can be produced more quickly than it would if it were infecting the cell alone. Finally, we assumed that a superinfected cell starts producing both viruses and stops producing both viruses at the same time. In all likelihood, the time at which a cell starts and stops producing virus is determined by the time elapsed since the cell was infected by a particular virus. Since individual cells are not infected with both viruses simultaneously, they will not start producing virus simultaneously. Addition of age-structure to within host models does not alter the longterm dynamics of the model ( Browne, 2015; Browne and Pilyugin, 2013; Holder et al., 2011 ) , but does change the duration of the infection, so addition of more accurate age structure will likely alter the coinfection duration. These details will need to be explored experimentally so that they can be added to more detailed models of coinfection.",

In such cases, treatment becomes an important consideration. Treatment of only one of the viruses could result in growth of a potentially harmful virus that was suppressed to some extent by the presence of the other virus.
